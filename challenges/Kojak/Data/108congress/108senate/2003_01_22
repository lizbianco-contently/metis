Mr. President, this morning, after 10 minutes for debate, \nthe Senate will vote in relation to the Inhofe amendment regarding \nclean air, to be followed by a vote in relation to the Edwards \namendment. Following those votes, the Senate will proceed to executive \nsession for the consideration of the nomination of Tom Ridge to be \nSecretary of Homeland Security. We have a consent agreement which \nprovides for a limited period of debate, and therefore I expect a vote \non the confirmation prior to the policy luncheons. I expect the Senate \nto recess for the policy luncheons following the vote on the Ridge \nnomination.\n  Additional amendments are pending to the appropriations measure, and \ntherefore rollcall votes will occur throughout the afternoon and into \nthe evening.\n  I remind my colleagues that late nights are anticipated as we \ncontinue to make progress on the bill.\n  As of last night, 245 amendments were filed. As I look through page \nafter page of these amendments, I think all of us expected much fewer \nthan that. I encourage my colleagues, as I look through page after page \nof amendments, to come together and ask that most or many of these \namendments not be called up, that we can work them out in other ways. I \nalso ask my colleagues to recognize that we do need to finish this \nappropriations bill in short order and go forward as we look at issues \nsuch as funding first responders and funding election reform which we \nhave already passed.\n  Our goal, I think on both sides of the aisle, is to finish this bill \nas soon as possible, allowing time for debate and consideration of the \nappropriate amendments on this bill. Our goal is to finish this week. \nWe will continue to work in good faith, working across the aisle, \naddressing each of the issues that are important to these \nappropriations bills. We worked yesterday and made great progress. We \nmade great progress last night, into the early evening, and have been \nworking on the amendments over the course of the last 18 hours since we \nhave had the amendments. That goal of finishing this week is real and \none that we should work towards accomplishing.\n\n  If we do finish this bill Thursday night, I expect we would not have \nrollcall votes on Friday or Monday. If we cannot finish it by tomorrow \nnight--again, I recognize that is ambitious, but if we focus on \ncompletion of the bill, we can accomplish that--we will have rollcall \nvotes through Friday and\n\n[[Page S1302]]\n\nwe will have rollcall votes until we finish it, including Monday and \ninto next week.\n  Again, working together, looking at these amendments, having a number \nof them not called up and recognizing we can address these issues in \nother ways as we go forward, I hope we get these to a manageable \nnumber.\n  Mr. REID. If the majority leader will yield, this morning, on the \nRidge speeches, people who have designated time should be here or they \nwill lose their time because the time will run. It is my understanding \nthat the majority may not use all their time so I suggest to those on \nthis side of the aisle they should be here; otherwise, they will lose \ntheir time.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I add to that, we decided not to do the \nRidge nomination out of consideration for a number of people who wanted \nto speak who either were not back last night or prepared to go forward. \nWe reached an agreement yesterday we would give time to people who \nrequested it. We did that by unanimous consent and it is set up for \nthis morning. I ask anyone on that list to come down and we will \nrespectfully give them that time. We need to finish this vote this \nmorning. We would like to have a vote this morning or shortly after \nnoon.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the majority leader yield for a brief statement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I address the majority leader. We have gone over the \namendments. Quite a few of them are technical in nature and legislative \nin nature. We have members of our staff in the appropriations room \ndownstairs, room 128, prepared to discuss any amendment that a Member \nwishes to try to work out with the committee and have it adopted \nwithout votes. I believe there are quite a few in that category we \ncould accept. All of the amendments are being checked with the \ncommittees of legislative jurisdiction where they are legislative in \nnature and they do not affect the bill from a financial point of view.\n  I hope Members would tell us if they sincerely wish to press their \namendments. There are a great many that are very redundant. We will \nhave to choose as to which amendment the individual Senator wishes to \nbring forward. If we are to finish this bill and be able to get it to \nthe House for conference, when the House comes back, this means a lot \nof long hours.\n  I say at the outset, there are 129 amendments that our committee \nwould oppose. If a Member wishes to know which we will oppose, we are \nhappy to tell them. I urge the majority and minority to help us by \ndetermining the amendments that Members absolutely insist they will \nraise so we can get a schedule and start working our way through these \namendments. It will take the cooperation of every Member.\n\n  Keep in mind, these are bills that should have been passed last year. \nAmendments should not be the vehicle for legislation that would arise \nin this 2-year period of the new Congress. I hope everyone will join in \ntabling amendments that are legislative in nature, that should be \nraised later in the session. To hold up this bill at this time is very \nunfair to the thousands of people out there waiting to know whether \nthey will have funding at the level of 2003, as intended by the \nPresident and by the Congress, instead of continuing at the level of \nthe 2002 appropriations which, after all, were devised in the late part \nof 2001. We are dealing with people who have been waiting for 2 years \nnow to have different types of funding.\n  I hope we can get this bill done this week. I hope we have that will \nto get it done.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, let me continue through the Chair to \nencourage the managers to work very aggressively on both sides of the \naisle to complete this bill.\n  What I just heard from the bill managers, we need participation of \neveryone pulling together to give some focus to the 245 amendments in \norder to complete this bill. This is unfinished business from the last \nCongress. As my colleagues know, we are supposed to be on recess right \nnow, a scheduled recess for this week. We have called everyone back on \nthe floor of the Senate, all 100 U.S. Senators, and asked them to \ncancel their plans from overseas travel, meeting with leaders around \nthe world, to meeting with constituents at home, for the sole purpose \nof completing this bill and addressing these very important issues.\n  Again, I am optimistic we can finish this week, I am confident we \ncan, but only if we have the participation of everyone, recognizing the \nimportance of this bill and the appeal that the managers are making \nthat we all work together to get these amendments condensed to a \nmanageable number, and their willingness to work with us, again, \nessentially around the clock, on time that was supposed to be a recess, \nto complete this important bill.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. Leader, if I could, the manager of the bill, the \nPresident pro tempore of the Senate, has done outstanding work last \nnight and was able to get rid of 116 amendments. If we give him a few \nmore hours, maybe he can do better than that. I have great faith in the \nSenator from Alaska and the Senator from West Virginia.\n  I would say--and this is not the time for debate--people contend we \ndid not do the work of last year, and we should have, we acknowledge \nthat, but it was not the fault of the Senate. It was the fault of the \nHouse.\n  We are going, as I told the leader yesterday, to do everything we can \nto move this bill as quickly as we can. I think it would be in the best \ninterests of everyone if we did move it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/22/senate-section/article/S1302-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1302]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of amendment No. 86, with 10 minutes for debate to \nbe equally divided between the Senator from Oklahoma and the Senator \nfrom North Carolina.\n  Under the previous order, that amendment is modified to become a \nfirst-degree amendment.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert:\n\n       ``  . (a) Cooperative Agreement.--As soon as practicable \n     after the date of enactment of this Act, the Administrator of \n     the Environmental Protection Agency shall enter into a \n     cooperative agreement with the National Academy of Sciences \n     to evaluate the impact of the final rule relating to \n     prevention of significant deterioration and nonattainment new \n     source review, published at 67 Fed.

The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Let me acknowledge this is a little different than it was \nyesterday. Yesterday, it was a second-degree amendment. To accommodate \nboth sides, we will have two first-degree amendments that we will \nconsider today.\n  Our leader talked about the unfinished business from last year. This \nfirst amendment falls into that category. It actually was unfinished \nbusiness from the Clinton administration. I have a letter from Bob \nPerciasepe, the clean air man, director for the Clinton administration, \nsaying at the last minute they were unable to get this completed. What \nwe are trying to do now is to complete this effort.\n  With that, I reserve the remainder of my time so we can hear from the \nSenator from North Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, first, I yield a minute and a half to my \nfriend from Vermont, who has worked so hard on this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote against the \nInhofe amendment and for the Edwards amendment. The Inhofe amendment \nmight appear to be a step in the right direction. It demonstrates our \nlegitimate concern that these NSR changes are bad for the environment, \nbad for public health. It shows that these impacts deserve better \nstudy.\n  Unfortunately, for that one step forward, the Inhofe amendment takes \ntwo steps backward. The Inhofe amendment requires a study that should \nhave been completed long before the rules were finalized and certainly \nbefore they become effective.\n  That is the whole point of Executive Order 12866. The Agency should \nhave done a comprehensive cost and benefit analysis of this \nderegulation, because of the tremendous potential loss in health \nbenefits.\n  Instead, the Agency issued a warmed over version of its report to the \nWhite House energy task force and called it analysis. That report is \nsimply propaganda to justify deregulating vast numbers of major sources \nof pollution.\n  These final NSR rules are very different from the reforms proposed by \nthe Clinton administration. The differences warrant longer review and \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed his minute and a \nhalf.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I yield the Senator another 30 seconds.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, we have tried to do that. But this \nadministration has fought us at every turn on this matter. They refuse \nto share information that is our right to have.\n  The Inhofe amendment doesn't work. It would bar the door after the \nhorse has already left the barn. We need real public health and air \nquality information before the rules take effect, not later, after the \ndamage is done.\n  That damage could be severe. Independent analysis for just a few \nstates--Florida, Virginia and Colorado--suggests that the rules would \nallow new emissions of thousands of tons annually of smog or acid rain \ncausing pollutants.\n  There is one final note for Senators to consider--the potentially \nlarge increases in pollution from these so-called NSR ``improvements'' \nwill come back to haunt them. Other sources and sectors in \nnonattainment areas, such as transportation, for instance, will have to \nmake up the difference in emissions that is necessary to achieve air \nquality standards. It's a zero sum game.\n  Senators should first vote against the Inhofe amendment and then \nsupport the Edwards-Lieberman-Jeffords amendment.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, we reserve the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, let me make one point. The analysis that \nwas referred to by the Senator from Vermont as not being complete is \nright here. It is 180 pages of analysis of all data that was available. \nIf they were to try to have the NAS do a further analysis, they would \nhave to go back and use this same data. This job has been done. This \nhas been delayed now for 10 years.\n  At this point I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Missouri, Mr. \nBond.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, the administration's New Source Review, or \nNSR review, will benefit the environment. Right now companies face an \naverage delay of 8 months, sometimes as long as 18 months, to get an \nNSR permit. Therefore, many companies avoid the process altogether. \nThat means that there are environmental losses because companies stick \nwith old, outdated technologies instead of the most modern, efficient \npollution control measures.\n  There is a specific example. EPA has done a plantwide application \nlimits, or PALS, test and the results are striking. Many companies have \nmultiple emissions from many different sources, including big to \nextremely small pipes. If you tried to do it under the existing \nframework, you would have to have a permit for each one. As a facility \nwants to upgrade or modernize, they have go through a time-consuming \nprocess but PALS allows a plant to calculate its total emissions from \nall sources. As long as they stay below the plantwide total, they can \ndo it.\n  A striking example is at the DaimlerChrysler plant in Newark, DE, \nwhere they make Dodge Durango trucks. They needed to upgrade their \nprocess. They did it. PALS allowed them to make over 90 changes.\n  The environment was benefited. An amazing thing happened. With the \nnew flexibility, the plant was able to cut pollution in its painting \nprocess, cut smog-forming volatile organic compounds and hazardous \nplant pollutants. Plant managers cut 400 tons of air pollution from the \nclean air process and cut paint odors by 50 percent.\n  We have auto assembly plants in Missouri. We make light trucks and \nvans. I would love for my constituents to breathe cleaner air because \nof the PALS program reforms. That is why the Clinton administration's \nEPA, led by Carol Browner, supported the NSR reforms. We should and I \nurge support for the Inhofe amendment and the defeat of the Edwards \namendment.\n  Mr. INHOFE. We reserve the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, this administration has made new rules \nthat are the biggest rollback of clean air protections in history. The \namendment from me, Senator Lieberman, Senator Jeffords, Senator Reid, \nSenator Daschle, and others says: Before the administration puts kids \nwith asthma and seniors with respiratory problems at risk, we ought to \ntake at least 6 months to see what effect it is going to have on their \nhealth. In other words, what we are saying is let's look before we \nleap.\n  The amendment from my friend from Oklahoma says exactly the opposite. \nIt says let's leap and then later we will look. What are we going to \nsay when the study that he is proposing is completed if, in fact, it \nshows what all of us believe it is going to show now, which is that \nthis change will cause pollution, it is going to put kids with asthma \nat risk, it is going to put senior citizens with serious respiratory \nproblems at risk? What are we going to say to them, those kids who have \nhad asthma attacks, seniors who have had serious heart or respiratory \nproblems as a result of these changes in the rules?\n  In other words, what the Inhofe amendment is suggesting is let's \npollute more now, study it, and when we find out we are wrong we will \ngo back and do something about it.\n  The responsible thing to do is to conduct a serious, quantitative \nanalysis so we can determine what impact this will have on kids and \nwhat impact it will have on seniors' health before it has the force of \nlaw.\n  This study that is referred to by my friend from Oklahoma could well \nhave been bought and paid for by the administration's own people. It is \ncalled ``qualitative,'' which means it is guessing by political \nappointees as opposed to serious analysis. The career officials within \nthe EPA itself have said that it is self-selecting and misleading. One \nof the key States that is cited in the study has actually disavowed it.\n  The bottom line is this: The EPA has never scientifically studied and \nmodeled this issue. The one analysis that did do that, by private \nconsultants that the EPA has used in the past, says that these new \nrules will cause 120 tons more pollution at just two factories.\n\n[[Page S1304]]\n\n  We should not leap before we look. We need to see what impact this \nwill have on the health of kids and seniors. And all we are asking is 6 \nmonths.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from North Carolina \ntime has expired. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, how much time remains for both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma controls a minute \nand a half. The time has expired for the Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. INHOFE. First, let me comment that this amendment enjoys the \nembrace and the support of virtually every organization of business or \nlabor unions in America. It was unanimously approved by the National \nGovernors Association, the Environmental Council of the States, the \nNational Black Chamber of Commerce, et cetera, and virtually every \nlabor union in America.\n  At this time I recognize the chairman of the clean air subcommittee, \nthe Senator from Ohio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I think the arguments have been made \nthat this is about delaying something that has been looked at for over \nthe last 10 years. I hope my colleagues will decide this issue today on \na bipartisan basis, as was the letter that we sent to Administrator \nWhitman, asking that she move forward with the new regulations to end \nsome 4 or 5 years of uncertainty by businesses throughout this country, \nin terms of routine maintenance and repair of their facilities. This \nvote for the Inhofe amendment is a vote for the environment. It will \nallow us to move forward quickly, to do what should have been done \nseveral years ago so these repairs and the maintenance can be done. We \ncan reduce the emissions and we can make these facilities more \nefficient.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The Senator from North \nCarolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that each side be \ngiven an additional minute.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I object. I am going to object to all requests for \nextension of time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The question is on \nagreeing to the amendment of the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?

The question now occurs on agreeing to the \namendment offered by the Senator from North Carolina. Under the \nprevious order, there will be a 10-minute rollcall vote. The Senator \nfrom North Carolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that each side be \ngiven 1 minute prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, the administration has proposed some of \nthe most dramatic changes in the Clean Air Act that have been made in \nour history. All this amendment says is before we make these \nsignificant changes, we take a serious look at a quantitative study of \nwhat effect it is going to have on human health, particularly kids with \nasthma and seniors with cardiorespiratory problems. Look before we \nleap. It is that simple.\n  The studies that have been done have not been serious scientific \nstudies. There has not been any serious scientific study done to \nsupport this rule. The only serious scientific studies say this rule \nwill cause significantly more pollution.\n  In addition to that, the Governors, although they support some kind \nof reform, specifically do not support this reform, and so it is \ncritically important that Senators support this amendment for the sake \nof our kids and for the sake of our seniors. Six months just to \ndetermine what effect this will have on the health of our kids and our \nseniors is a perfectly reasonable, responsible thing to do. I ask my \ncolleagues to vote for the amendment.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of all those who \nbreathe and I want to thank the sponsors of this amendment for their \nefforts. I say that half in jest, because I get the feeling that those \nwho are trying to weaken our clean air laws often forget why we passed \nthem in the first place--so we all can breathe cleaner, healthier air. \nI certainly support the most efficient and effective regulations we can \ndevise to curb pollution, and I agree with the statement that the New \nSource Review Program could use some reform, but we must not lose sight \nof the fact that these rules are designed first and foremost to protect \npublic health.\n  The Bush administration has shifted priorities from protecting the \npublic to protecting polluters from doing their best. The Bush \nadministration is protecting special interests, rather than protecting \nour environment and the public health. That is unacceptable and \nthreatens to reverse the progress we have made as a nation to protect \nour citizens from health threats in the workplace and environment.\n  This is a serious issue for the people in my state of Delaware. We \nlive in a region that is in non-attainment with the Federal ozone \nstandard. Bottom line, we don't meet the current health-based \nstandards. But not all of our air pollution comes from industry in \nDelaware. We could do everything right and still not be in compliance. \nWhat our neighbors do and what industries do in other parts of the \ncountry affects us and our ability to breathe clean air. If power \nplants in Pennsylvania, Maryland or even West Virginia and Ohio aren't \nrequired to do all they can to reduce harmful emissions, we pay the \nprice in higher respiratory illnesses and premature deaths, \nparticularly among children and the elderly. To me, that is all the \nmore reason that we should be tightening the rules, reducing emissions \nfrom coal-fired power plants, instead of making it easier for the \nutility companies.\n\n  But you know what is so surprising to me, what I just can't \nunderstand--the administration has no data to even suggest that these \nchanges will improve air quality, nor have they conducted any analysis, \nstudies, anything. Show me that the changes will not cause a \ndeterioration in the quality of our air. Show me that children and the \nelderly will not have to worry about being outside in the summer. Show \nme that states like Delaware will benefit. And we, my colleagues in the \nSenate and I, have asked . . . repeatedly!\n\n[[Page S1305]]\n\n  That is why this amendment is so important. This amendment does two \nthings. First, it would prevent the implementation of the rule changes \nprior to September 15, 2003. Second, it simply asks for a rigorous \nanalysis of the air pollution and public health impacts of the proposed \nrule changes. The National Academy of Sciences would be tasked with \ncompleting this study by August 15, 2003. Sure, it would have made \nsense to do the analysis before the changes were published in the \nFederal Register, but it is not too late.\n  I want to share briefly a success story from my state of Delaware \nwhere we helped pioneer the Plantwide Applicability Limit, or so-called \nPAL permit. PAL is an innovative approach where separate process \npermitting requirements are consolidated in exchange for greater \npollution reductions. This allows flexibility for plant process \nexpansion and modification while saving businesses time and money. And \nit works.\n\n  One permit Delaware helped pioneer was at DaimlerChrysler's Newark \nDelaware Assembly Plant, where the Dodge Durango is manufactured. The \nplant focuses primarily on vehicle coating--painting--and assembly of \nparts produced at other DaimierChrysler facilities to produce finished \nvehicles. Years ago, when it wanted to start producing the Durango, the \nplant had to build a new state-of-the-art paint shop in a new building. \nPermit applications for this new process triggered New Source Review \nrequirements for non-attainment areas. Working with the EPA, one of the \nfirst ever PAL permits was issued to the plant in 1996. And, the \npermit, the first of its kind for the automotive industry, was issued \nin 99 days. The plant continues to operate under this flexible permit \nand, as an added benefit, has saved Chrysler $13 million in increased \nproductivity and pollution prevention. This was a win-win situation. \nChrysler won with a permit that gave them flexibility to meet \nproduction needs and Delaware citizens won through reduced air \npollution. Not surprising, Delaware does not believe it could repeat \nthe pollution prevention performance of the PAL permit it issued under \nthe new rule and is opposing the reform proposal.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. Give us 6 months to \nfind out. Send the right message. Let's not forget that these rules are \ndesigned to protect public health, not to protect industry from \nfulfilling its civic duty. Let's not reverse the progress we have made \nover the past three decades.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, today I voted in favor of the Edwards \namendment requiring a 6-month delay in four New Source Review, NSR, \nrules so that a study by the National Academy of Sciences, NAS, could \nbe carried out. I support a commonsense approach to making air quality \nimprovements while also increasing our economic growth. I have long \nbeen a supporter of the steel, coal, chemical, forestry, and other \ninterests in my State. Still, the Edwards amendment, requiring a short \n6-month delay with a study regarding the health and environmental \nimpacts of these four rules, was imperative in my mind. Evidence of \nthis administration's intransigence is ubiquitous across the many \nagencies. Congress has the right and responsibility to get important \ninformation in order to make more informed decisions. A better \nunderstanding of the health and environmental impacts of these new \nrules is an important part of that decisionmaking process.\n  When the Clean Air Act was amended in 1977, Congress established the \nNSR program to prevent serious deterioration in the Nation's air \nquality. The intention of this program was to strike a delicate balance \nbetween making important improvements in the Nation's air quality while \nalso allowing existing factories, powerplants, and other facilities to \nmeet our changing energy, economic, and social needs.\n  Over the years, it has become evident that these NSR regulations are \nvery complicated requiring many thousands of pages of guidance. This \nred tape has led to much industry uncertainty and litigation. For a \nnumber of years, the EPA has been examining and documenting these \nproblems, and the NSR program is in need of reform. Even as we must \nmaintain our air quality, NSR should not be an impediment to making \ncommonsense improvements at industrial facilities.\n  However, Members of Congress have made numerous requests of the \nadministration regarding its justifications for promulgating these new \nrules. Unfortunately, the Environmental Protection Agency has not \nadequately responded to these congressional requests for information on \nthe potential impacts of these NSR reforms. While I do not support \nefforts to halt this important reform effort, I believe that this \nadministration must be more responsive to the interests of Congress so \nthat the public has a more complete understanding of these issues and \ntheir effect on our Nation.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I joined Senators Edwards and Lieberman \nas a cosponsor of their amendment to delay implementation of the Bush \nadministration's proposed weakening of the Clean Air Act. This \namendment would delay implementation of the regulations for 6 months \nwhile the National Academy of Sciences conducts an analysis on the \neffects of the rules on public health and the environment.\n  On December 31, 2002, the Bush administration finalized the most \nsignificant weakening of the clean air protections since the Clean Air \nAct was adopted 30 years ago. These changes would allow increased \nlevels of pollution at 17,000 industrial facilities across the Nation. \nMore than 170 million Americans live in areas with unhealthy air \nquality. Air pollution is a serious public health problem, particularly \namong children and senior citizens.\n  Mounting medical evidence shows that air pollution causes asthma \nattacks, heart and lung disease, and premature death. More than 1,000 \nphysicians from across the Nation urged the administration to halt its \nproposed weakening of the Clean Air Act. In a September 27, 2002 letter \nto the administration, the physicians said, ``It is irresponsible for \nthe Environmental Protection Agency to move forward and finalize new \nregulations that could have a negative impact on human health.''\n  For 2 years, the Environment and Public Works Committee, Judiciary \nCommittee and the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee have \nissued more than a dozen requests for documents and an analysis from \nthe administration on the public health impacts of the clean air \nchanges. The administration ignored these requests.\n  Many states have objected to the clean air changes. The State and \nTerritorial Air Pollution Program administrators have asked for a 1-\nyear delay to assess the new regulations. Twelve States, including my \nState of South Dakota, face a March 3 deadline to comply with the new \nregulations. We hear so much from the administration about working with \nstates but in this case the administration turned its back on South \nDakota and 11 other States, that are simply asking for more time to \nunderstand these regulations. In a January 16, 2003 letter to EPA \nAdministrator Christine Whitman, the State and local air administrators \nsaid, ``State and local air pollution control agencies have been \nworking vigorously to study the new rule. However, gaining full command \nof the many intricacies of the regulation, as well as complete \nunderstanding of the impacts and implications, will take time and, we \nfirmly believe, cannot be accomplished in the next 45 days.''\n  This amendment makes a very simple requirement: before these sweeping \nregulations are put into place, the National Academy of Sciences should \nconduct an objective study of the effects these rules would have on \npublic health and the environment. I strongly urge my colleagues to \nvote for this amendment.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I was pleased today to vote in support \nof the Edwards-Lieberman amendment, which I was proud to cosponsor with \nmy colleague Senator Jeffords and others. Unfortunately, this effort to \ntemporarily halt the Bush administration's weakening of the Clean Air \nAct was narrowly defeated. Although we were simply trying to obtain an \nindependent, scientific analysis of the impact of these Clean Air Act \nchanges before they went into effect, rather than after, the amendment \nwas opposed by half of the Senate.\n  Just shy of passage, this vote was a very strong showing of \nbipartisan support of protecting clean air and ensuring healthy \ncommunities, and against\n\n[[Page S1306]]\n\nany backsliding on the Clean Air Act. And it was not by any means the \nend of this debate. We will not give up this fight to stop any \nweakening of existing Clean Air Act protections and to ensure that all \nAmericans have clean, healthy air to breathe.\n  Many believe that the Clean Air Act changes the Bush administration \nhas made, and which go into effect in less than 6 weeks, will allow \nmore pollution into our air, not less. More pollution that is known, \nscientifically and medically proven, to cause or contribute to asthma \nattacks, heart attacks, cardiopulmonary disease, cancer, and even \npremature death. More pollution that is making people sick, especially \nchildren and the elderly.\n  That is why my colleagues and I were seeking 6 months for the \nNational Academy of Sciences to conduct an independent, scientific \nanalysis of the Bush administration's changes to the New Source Review, \nNSR, provisions of the Clean Air Act before they went into effect, to \nensure that they would not negatively impact air quality or public \nhealth. The reason we are seeking such a study is simple, it's a matter \nof public health and, in some cases, life and death.\n  Just last week, The New York Times reported the findings of a study \nby scientists at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health. \nThe study, to be published next month in the journal Environmental \nHealth Perspectives, finds that ``pollutants in the air in Upper \nManhattan and the South Bronx have been linked to lower birth weights \nand smaller skulls in African-American babies.'' The study's findings \nare particularly troubling because lower birth weights and smaller \nskulls have been linked to poor physical and mental health later in \nlife, including lower IQs and poor cognitive function.\n  This particular study is being conducted at the Center for Children's \nEnvironmental Health, which is currently being funded by the U.S. \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, EPA, and the National Institute of \nEnvironmental Health Sciences. Unfortunately, the EPA wants to reduce \nfunding for these Children's Environmental Health Centers around the \ncountry. But that is another matter.\n  The point is that air pollution is scientifically proven to have \nnegative health impacts--particularly on children. Other studies show \nthat children who play sports in communities with high average air \npollution levels have a higher risk of developing respiratory illness, \nand that children who live in polluted areas have a 10 percent lower \nlung function growth rate compared to those who live in less polluted \nareas.\n  Pound for pound, children breathe more air than adults, which makes \nthem more susceptible to air pollution. But we are all at risk.\n  That is why we need to be doing more--not less--to clean up our air, \nprotect children's health, and provide for safe and health communities. \nToday, about 175 million Americans live in areas violating health \nstandards for smog or soot. That is unacceptable. And that is why we \nneed to be applying the Clean Air Act to its utmost and keeping it as \nstrong an environmental statute as possible.\n  We offered this amendment today because we are concerned that the \nchanges the Administration has made to the NSR provisions of the Clean \nAir Act will do the exact opposite. We believe, as do many others, that \nthese changes will allow more pollution into our air, not less.\n  That is why 1,000 doctors, nurses, and public health professional \nfrom all over the country wrote to John Graham, Director of the Office \nof Information and Regulatory Affairs at the White House, last \nSeptember to ask him to block these changes that they believed would \nweaken the Clean Air Act. In their letter, these health professionals \nsaid, ``Pollution . . . regulated under NSR touches the lives of \nmillions of Americans across the Nation. This pollution is harmful to \nhuman health and sends thousands of individuals to hospital emergency \nrooms each month. Study after study shows a link between exposure to \nair pollution and health conditions such as respiratory diseases, \nasthma attacks, cardiopulmanory disease, cancer, and even death. No \nchanges to NSR should occur without the public being provided with a \ncomprehensive analysis demonstrating that the proposed changes to NSR \nwill improve air quality and human health.''\n  That is essentially what this amendment called for--an independent, \nscientific study by the National Academy of Sciences to determine \nwhether the Administration's changes to NSR could result in any \nincrease in air pollution or any adverse effect on human health. By \nwaiting just a few months, we could make certain that these rule \nchanges would not increase pollution or negatively impact human health.\n  We are saying, ``Don't take us at our word. Don't take the words of \nthese thousand health care providers. Let's let the scientists tell us \nwhat the impacts of these changes will be.'' Unfortunately, some of our \ncolleagues would rather allow the Bush Administration changes to go \nforward, and then do the study after the fact to see what impacts we \nexperience on air quality and human health. If there are negative \nimpacts, which we think there will be, we may be able to pull back the \nrule at a later date. But we will not be able to pull back any air \npollution that is released, or any hospitalizations, asthma attacks, \nheart attacks, or other health impacts that occur as a result.\n  This is not the way the process is supposed to work. We are supposed \nto know, before we go forward with any rulemaking, what the impacts of \nthat rulemaking will be. And we have asked, repeatedly, for such \ninformation from the administration, to no avail. Which is why we \noffered this amendment today.\n  When the Congress passed the Clean Air Act and President Nixon signed \nthe Act into law back in 1970, the intent was to reduce air pollution \nand protect public health. As section 101(b) of the Clean Air Act \nstates, one of the purposes of the Act is ``to protect and enhance the \nquality of the Nation's air resources so as to promote the public \nhealth and welfare.''\n  All we were trying to do today, and what we will be continuing to \nfight for, is to ensure that the purpose of the Clean Air Act is \nupheld. I don't think this is too much to ask.\n  Especially when in testimony before the Senate, former EPA \nAdministrator Carol Browner stated, ``There is no guarantee, and more \nimportantly, no evidence or disclosure demonstrating that the \nadministration's announced final or proposed changes will make the air \ncleaner. In fact they will allow the air to become dirtier.''\n  Especially when EPA, in its own Supplemental Analysis of the \nEnvironmental Impact of the 2002 Final NSR Improvement Rules, dated \nNovember 21, 2002, states ``. . . the EPA cannot quantify with \nspecificity the emissions changes for a given pollutant or pollutants, \nif any, that result from the NSR rule changes now being adopted, nor \ncan we reliably determine the anticipated locations of any emissions \nchanges.''\n  Especially when, despite numerous requests from the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee, and from more than 40 of our colleagues in the \nSenate, the EPA has failed to provide us with definitive evidence that \nshows that these final changes to the NSR provisions of the Clean Air \nAct will not have a negative impact on air quality or on human health.\n  A few months for independent, scientific certainty that these rule \nchanges will improve air quality and not adversely effect human health. \nIt is not too much to ask.\n  In fact, just last week, the State and Territorial Air Pollution \nProgram Administrators and the Association of Local Air Pollution \nControl Officials wrote to EPA Administrator Whitman and asked that the \neffective date of the final NSR rule revision be delayed by a whole \nyear. Their letter reads, ``As you are aware, the State and Territorial \nAir Pollution Program Administrators, STAPPA, and the Association of \nLocal Air Pollution Control Officials, ALAPCO, have serious concerns \nwith the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's, EPA's, recently \npromulgated final rule affecting changes to the New Source Review, NSR, \nprogram, 67 Federal Register 80186, and with the adverse impact these \nchanges would likely have on the ability of States and localities to \nachieve and sustain clean, healthful air. These concerns are further \ncompounded by the fact that, for a number of States across the country, \nthe revised NSR program is scheduled to take effect on March 3, 2003. \nAccordingly, we write to you today, on behalf\n\n[[Page S1307]]\n\nof STAPPA and ALAPCO, to request that EPA extend by 1 year the \neffective date of the final NSR rule revisions.''\n\n  These same State, territorial, and local air officials, which have \ngone on record in support of changes to NSR, believe that ``the \nadministration has gone too far in revamping the program'' and that \n``because the reforms are mandatory, they will impede, or even \npreclude, the ability of States and localities all across the country \nto retain or adopt programs that are more protective than the Federal \nrequirements.''\n  That is in part why the Attorneys General from nine States are suing \nthe Federal Government over these changes. Whereas the existing NSR \nprogram was the foundation for a series of lawsuits brought by the \nStates, the Federal Government and environment groups against dozens of \nold, coal-fired powerplants and other industrial sources, the tables \nare now turned.\n  Now, the Attorneys General from nine States, New York, Connecticut, \nMaine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Rhode \nIsland, and Vermont, have had to file a lawsuit against the Federal \nGovernment, challenging these new regulations. The very regulations \nthat the States had been using in conjunction with the Federal \nGovernment to go after bad actors and improve air quality.\n  Some of us will join in that lawsuit, because we, too, are convinced \nthat the Bush administration is violating the Clean Air Act and going \nagainst the intent of Congress. But again, that is a separate matter.\n  Again, as I already stated, this vote was a very strong showing of \nbipartisan support for protecting clean air and ensuring healthy \ncommunities, and against any backsliding on the Clean Air Act. And it \nwas by no means the end of this debate. We will not give up this fight \nto stop any weakening of existing Clean Air Act protections and to \nensure that all Americans have clean, healthy air to breathe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, to clear up a couple things, first, this \ndoes not apply to coal-fired plants. The Senator from North Carolina \nhas been talking about that. I have a letter from the administrator \nsaying that. Second, this is not something that came out of the Bush \nadministration. It is something that came out of the Clinton \nadministration. In listening to some of the comments made by some of \nthe Senators on the other side, I think they have lost sight of that \nfact.\n  Third, it is hard to find anyone who is not supporting this. People \nwant these plants to be able to go ahead, make the improvements, clean \nup the air, and do a better job for the environment. We have the \nNational Conference of State Legislators, Governors, the environmental \ncouncils of the States, the National Black Chamber of Commerce, \nvirtually every labor union; they are all listed. The list is on the \ndesks. I would encourage Members not to delay this effort. All this \namendment would do is delay it for 6 more months. It has already been \ndelayed for 10 years. It is time to go ahead. I urge Members to vote \nagainst the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. EDWARDS.

Mr. President, it is my understanding that we are now \nturning to consideration of the nomination of Thomas Ridge; is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. The Senator will \ncontrol 1 hour 40 minutes.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Under the previous order, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  For the information of my colleagues, I expect my initial statement \nwill not exceed 12 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the nomination of \nGov. Tom Ridge to be the first Secretary of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. As\n\n[[Page S1308]]\n\nchairman of the Committee on Governmental Affairs, I assure my \ncolleagues the committee thoroughly considered this nomination in an \nextensive hearing last Friday at which the nominee expertly and in a \nforthright manner answered all of the questions posed to him. Every \nmember of the committee participated in the hearing at some point and \neach member was able to pose questions to Governor Ridge.\n  Subsequently, the committee voted unanimously to report Governor \nRidge's nomination to the full Senate. I am very pleased we are taking \nup this important assignment today.\n  The United States has made substantial progress in improving homeland \nsecurity since the terrorist attacks of September 11. The new \nDepartment of Homeland Security will provide the organizational \nframework to help our Nation better cope with the threat of a terrorist \nattack. September 11, 2001, underscored the concerns raised by many \nexperts, including the members of the Hart-Rudman Commission who warned \nour Nation was not adequately prepared for 21st century threats but, \nrather, was still operating under a cold war threat environment. The \nnature of the threat has changed since the end of the cold war. Change \nhas brought with it the need to reorganize the Government in a way that \nwill enable us to better protect our Nation and its citizens.\n  September 11 focused our attention on homeland security. Now we \nunderstand all too well why it is a problem if our first responders do \nnot have compatible communication systems. Interoperability has gone \nfrom being a buzzword to a matter of life and death. Now we understand \nthe vulnerability posed by 17 million shipping containers arriving in \nthe United States from ports all over the world with few of them ever \nbeing searched. Now we understand our Nation's 20,000 miles of land and \nsea borders present countless opportunities for those who would do us \nharm.\n  We also understand we can no longer rely on an ad hoc approach to \nhomeland security. Currently, as many as 100 Federal agencies are \nresponsible in some way for homeland security. But not one has homeland \nsecurity as its primary mission. When that many entities are \nresponsible, none is really accountable and turf battles and \nbureaucratic disputes are inevitable.\n  The new Department of Homeland Security will work to address these \nproblems by better securing our ports, our borders, and our critical \ninfrastructure. It will synthesize and analyze intelligence information \nfrom multiple sources. It will coordinate security activities now \nundertaken separately by agencies such as the Customs Service, the INS, \nand the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The new Department will \nhelp remedy many of the current organizational weaknesses in order to \nbetter protect us against future attacks.\n  Congress's passage of legislation creating this new Department was \nonly the first step in what will be a long and difficult process. The \nhomeland security effort will take all of us working together as a \nteam--the administration, the new Secretary, and the Congress--to \nensure the success of this massive reorganization. This effort will \nrequire the new Secretary to overcome unique challenges. The \nDepartment's leadership will have to address management and \nreorganization issues, as well as issues related to integrating the \nvarious agencies, each with differing work rules, information \ntechnology systems, and cultures.\n\n  In addition to these challenges, the new Secretary must also ensure \nthat the nonhomeland security functions moving to the Department are \nnot neglected. For example, it is critically important to my home State \nof Maine and to coastal communities throughout our Nation that the \nCoast Guard's new homeland security responsibilities not divert its \nattention from its traditional role, including search and rescue \nmissions. In a given year, the Coast Guard performs over 39,000 search \nand rescue missions.\n  Just recently, the Coast Guard was involved in a rescue of two \nfishermen from a fishing island off the coast of Maine. On a typical \nday, the Coast Guard saves 10 lives, interdicts 14 illegal immigrants, \ninspects and repairs 135 buoys, and helps more than 2,500 commercial \nships navigate into and out of U.S. ports.\n  Because of the vital importance of these functions, Senator Stevens \nand I worked with many of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \ninclude strong language in the new Homeland Security Act to ensure that \nthe Coast Guard will continue to make search and rescue and other \ntraditional missions a priority, not an afterthought.\n  Another challenge for the new Department will be to effectively \nsupport those men and women who are on the front lines, our Nation's 2 \nmillion first responders, including our police officers, our \nfirefighters, and our emergency medical personnel. The Homeland \nSecurity Act establishes a new office for State and local government \ncoordination, but it offers no assurance that the new Department will \ncoordinate and communicate effectively with our Nation's first \nresponders.\n  Ensuring that our partners at the State and local level have \nsufficient attention, resources, and cooperation will require more \nwork.\n  This is another advantage that Governor Ridge brings to this \nimportant job. As a Governor, he understands better than most people \nhow important the role played by State and local governments is to our \nnational security.\n  The establishment of the Department of Homeland Security will be the \nmost significant restructuring of the Federal Government in more than \n50 years. It is the most important reorganization since Congress \ncreated the Department of Defense in 1947. It will involve the merger \nof 22 Federal agencies and some 170,000 employees. Managing this \nDepartment will pose extraordinary challenges.\n  Fortunately, we have before us a man of extraordinary capacity in \nGov. Tom Ridge. Governor Ridge's resume is impressive. In addition to \nhis current service as assistant to the President for homeland \nsecurity, Governor Ridge twice was elected as Governor of Pennsylvania, \nserved six terms in the Congress, and worked as an assistant district \nattorney in Pennsylvania. His resume speaks to the management and \nleadership skills that he possesses which will be necessary to make \nthis effort successful.\n  Perhaps the clearest indication of Governor Ridge's character is \nsomething that you won't find on his resume. It is the story of his \nservice in the U.S. Army during the Vietnam war. Governor Ridge was one \nof the few, if not the only, graduate of Harvard who served in Vietnam \nas an enlisted man, and he did so with great distinction. Infantry \nStaff Sergeant Ridge was awarded a Bronze Star for valor. These are \nimpressive credentials that speak to the character of a remarkable man.\n  The new Department will not make us safer overnight, but its \nestablishment must lead, and I believe will lead, to new capabilities \nthat will make our Nation secure under the very capable leadership of \nTom Ridge. Our goal must be a department that enables our country to \nbetter deter, detect, prepare for, and, if necessary, respond to a \nterrorist attack.\n  To attain this goal will require not only extraordinary leadership \nfrom the new Secretary but also the cooperation of the agencies \ntransferred to the new Department and the full support of the Congress. \nUltimately, the success of the new Department rests not just on the \nbroad shoulders of Governor Ridge but on all of us.\n  Today I am hopeful the Senate will take an important step forward in \nmaking our homeland safer and more secure by promptly confirming \nGovernor Ridge. We are asked to confirm Governor Ridge for a Cabinet \npost that may well be the most challenging position created by Congress \nduring the last 50 years. I can't think of a better person to have at \nthe helm of this new Department when it opens its doors this Friday \nthan Governor Ridge.\n  For this reason it is important we act promptly so the new Department \nopens on Friday with a new Secretary firmly in control. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the confirmation of Governor Ridge as Secretary \nof Homeland Security. In my judgment, the President could not have made \na better choice for this critically important position.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I listened with great interest to the \nSenator from Maine. I can't think of a better person\n\n[[Page S1309]]\n\nto have on my side, if I were Governor Ridge, than the distinguished \njunior Senator from Maine. If I were feeling otherwise, I would be \nalmost persuaded--remembering that old Baptist hymn we used to sing in \nWest Virginia, ``Almost Persuaded,'' I would be almost persuaded to \nvote for him, if I had intended to otherwise. In this case, I think I \nwill join her in voting for Governor Ridge.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. BYRD. So I salute her.\n  Now that the nomination has been reported unanimously to the Senate \nby the Governmental Affairs Committee, it seems certain that Tom Ridge \nwill be confirmed by an overwhelming margin to be the Nation's first \nSecretary of Homeland Security.\n  And, while organizing 28 agencies--some say 22. I have heard that \nthere are 28 agencies and offices--within a new Homeland Security \nDepartment will be a difficult task, to say the least, Senators seem to \nbe confident that Governor Ridge is qualified to handle the job. I \nthink that is the case. Governor Ridge appears to have the necessary \nqualities and experience to serve admirably as the first Secretary of \nHomeland Security. But I hope he understands that his new job \nresponsibilities will involve more than just overseeing a new \nDepartment intended to protect our homeland.\n  Despite the objections of some Senators, this new Homeland Security \nDepartment has been empowered with wide-ranging authorities, and its \nofficers will have prime access to information about the American \npublic. With that access comes the potential for abuse.\n\n  We have already seen the administration pushing the legal envelope in \nthe fight against terrorism--so much so that phrases such as ``enemy \ncombatants,'' ``material witness warrants,'' and ``military tribunals'' \nhave become synonymous with terrorist-related arrests here at home. We \nhave seen the development of a parallel legal system for both U.S. \ncitizens and noncitizens in which terrorist suspects may be \ninvestigated, jailed, tried, and punished without the legal protections \nlong guaranteed by the American legal system.\n  Given the origins of this new Homeland Security Department--from the \ncrafting of a secret plan in the bowels of the White House, to the \nrefusal of the Homeland Security Director to testify before the \nCongress, to the expanding cloak of secrecy that has fallen over this \nadministration--it is essential that Governor Ridge understand that he \nwill be responsible not only for defending the homeland but also for \ndefending against the abuse of power inside the new department.\n  As the department's first Secretary, Governor Ridge will set the \nprecedents for how this new department uses its authorities in the name \nof homeland security. How far this department can peer into the lives \nof the American public will, in large part, be influenced by Governor \nRidge.\n  The Congress will continue to perform its oversight role and to be on \nthe lookout for abuses of power. But Senators will vote to confirm \nGovernor Ridge today with the expectation that he understands and \nrespects the oversight role of the Congress, and that he will never \nmislead the people's representatives or the people themselves about the \nactions of the department.\n  Most importantly, when the Senate votes to confirm Governor Ridge \ntoday, as I believe it will, it should be with the expectation that he \nrespect the constitutional doctrines of checks and balances and \nseparation of powers.\n  We have seen this administration running the Federal Government, to a \ndisconcerting degree, from within the confines of the White House. We \nhave seen how the President's advisors--whether they be his economic \nadvisors, his national security advisors, or his homeland security \nadvisors--can direct numerous Government actions, insulated from the \nCongress and the American public, by keeping the decisionmaking process \ninside of the Oval Office.\n  Over the last year, the White House has scrupulously avoided \nanswering the questions of the Congress, as this branch has tried to \nassess our Nation's homeland security vulnerabilities. It is this \nbody--this body--that must pass laws and provide funds to tighten up \nour borders, to hire inspectors, to buy vaccines, to prevent more \nterrorist attacks. But all too much, when we have looked for \ninformation on which to base our decisions from this administration, \nour requests have largely been denied. So today, we will vote to \nconfirm Governor Ridge to be Secretary of Homeland Security and to \nanswerable to us--answerable to the Congress, to both House of \nCongress--and to the people we represent.\n\n  This new department must not be just a public relations front, while \nthe real work of debate on strategies and crafting of policies is being \nconducted inside the Executive Office of the President, protected from \npublic scrutiny. The decisionmaking process with regard to the safety \nof our communities must remain open to the public, not hidden away. \nThis is the only way that we can work to ensure that our Government \noperates within the legal boundaries established by the Congress, and \nthat it does not threaten the privacy rights and civil liberties of the \nAmerican public. That is the only way that we can be sure that this \nmassive new department, in which so many have invested so must hope, \nactually does what it is supposed to do.\n  I intend to support the nomination of Governor Ridge, and I will do \nso with the hope he understands that he is charged with not only \nprotecting the American public from overzealous terrorists but also \nwith protecting their civil liberties from an overzealous new \nbureaucracy. And only time will tell. But time will tell. And so I \nexpress my support and shall cast my vote with the fervent hope that \nGovernor Ridge will not blindly follow the President but that he will \nrespect the institutional role of the Congress and be faithful to the \nConstitution and to the people whose liberties and safety may depend \nupon the decisions he, Mr. Ridge, will make.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I yield as much time as he would like to \nthe Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the distinguished chair of the committee and I \nbegin by congratulating her on her accession to the Chairmanship. Her \ndistinguished career began as a staffer for the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs. Senator Collins is now the chairwoman--a very \nsignificant advance.\n  I have sought recognition to support the nomination of Governor Tom \nRidge to be Secretary of Homeland Security. Tom Ridge embodies the \nclassic American success story. He was born in very modest \ncircumstances--an occupant of public housing as a youngster; Harvard \neducated, he served as an enlisted man in the Vietnam war, and was \nhonored with medals for his distinguished service. With outstanding \nacademic credentials from Dickinson Law School, Governor Ridge became \nan experienced assistant district attorney--which, I might add, is a \nvery important developmental office. Sometimes I am asked what office I \nconsider more important, being district attorney of Philadelphia or \nbeing a U.S. Senator. I am quick to respond that, for me, the most \nimportant office was assistant district attorney, with the development \nof trial skills, analysis, and organization.\n  Tom Ridge was an outstanding prosecuting attorney. He came to the \nCongress of the United States in 1982. I have worked closely with \nGovernor Ridge for the past 20 years plus. He was an outstanding two-\nterm Governor in Pennsylvania, enjoying great popularity and great \nsuccess.\n  Shortly after September 11, 2001, when Governor Ridge received a call \nfrom his former gubernatorial colleague--now President Bush--to take on \nthe job as Presidential Adviser of Homeland Security, Governor Ridge \nresponded as a great patriot, taking on the very difficult job of \ncoordinating the affairs on homeland security.\n  With the Department scheduled to come into existence on January 25, \nit is very important that we move ahead promptly with his confirmation. \nIt is my expectation that the vote will be overwhelming, if not \nunanimous. We had a hearing last Friday in the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee. Rules were waived to send the matter to the floor at an \nearly date. I am pleased to see that the majority leader has listed the \nissue for resolution today.\n\n  It is my hope that Governor Ridge will find, in this new position, \nthe ability in our Federal Government to put all of the so-called dots \non the board at\n\n[[Page S1310]]\n\nthe same time. It is my judgment that the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity needs a somewhat broader authority than the position has at \nthe present time institutionally.\n  I had filed an amendment to the homeland security bill which would \ngive the Secretary the authority to direct all of the intelligence \nagencies--the CIA, the FBI, the Defense Intelligence Agency, and all \nother agencies--so that the analytical aspects of the work would be \nunder one umbrella: Let the CIA conduct their work worldwide, let the \nFBI undertake their traditional role, and let the Defense Intelligence \nAgency undertake its regular duties as all of the intelligence agencies \ncontinue functioning operationally. But when it comes to analysis, it \nis my view that all ought to be under one umbrella.\n  Governor Ridge testified that there is excellent coordination among \nthe intelligence agencies at the present time. He testified last Friday \ncandidly, but he couldn't say what had happened before he came to the \nscene. I commented in my discussion with Governor Ridge during his \nconfirmation proceedings that he cannot say what would happen after he \nleft, that it is not a matter of personalities. The relationship \nbetween Governor Ridge and President Bush, which is a very close \nrelationship, enhances Governor Ridge's ability to gather information \nfrom the other intelligence agencies. But institutionally, we have to \nbe prepared for the day when the relationships might not be that close. \nWe are a government of laws, not a government of men; a government of \nrelationships defined by statute, and not depending upon personal \nrelationships.\n  It is my view that had all of the so-called dots been on the same \nboard prior to September 11, September 11 could have been avoided.\n  We now know about the famous FBI Phoenix report from the summer of \n2001 which was lost in the FBI bureaucracy. We now know more about the \neffort of the Minneapolis field office of the FBI to secure a warrant \nfor Zacarias Moussaoui under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. \nThe wrong standard was applied. They were looking for 15 percent--more \nprobable than not when the case law is that there has to be suspicion \nonly founded on the totality of the facts. We know the CIA had \ninformation about two men in Kuala Lumpur which was not conveyed to the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service or the FBI. Those men got into \nthe United States and were on two of the suicide bomber planes on 9/11. \nWe know the National Security Agency received a report on September 10 \nthat something was to happen the next day. It wasn't translated until \nSeptember 12.\n  So if all of these so-called dots had been on the board, I think the \nacts of 9/11 could have been prevented.\n  The Director of the Central Intelligence Agency testified last fall \nthat another attack would occur. I do not believe we have to concede \nthat. I do not believe we have to await another attack. I believe our \nfundamental job is to prevent an attack. We do have intelligence \nagencies where improvements have been made, and we need the cooperation \namong all of the intelligence agencies to put all of these so-called \ndots on the same board. It is my hope that Governor Ridge will \nultimately have that authority. As I said at the hearing on Friday, I \nintend to offer that amendment and pursue it through the legislative \nprocess in committee and to bring it to the floor of the Senate.\n\n  The issue of labor relations was also a matter discussed at the \nhearing. There is no doubt about the President's need for a national \nsecurity waiver. But it is my view that that is a Presidential judgment \nand a Presidential decision and that, to the extent possible, the \ntraditional labor-management laws of the United States ought to be \nfollowed unless there is a real national security interest as \ndetermined by the President in light of our very difficult war against \nterrorism and against al-Qaida.\n  I am pleased to see a man of Governor Ridge's competency coming to \nthis position. The toughest job is to stop calling him Governor Ridge \nand to start calling him Secretary Ridge. But we are going to start \nthat tomorrow as he takes on perhaps as tough a job as there is in \nWashington, DC, today.\n  I don't think I have to urge my colleagues to support this \nnomination. I think the vote will be overwhelming, if not unanimous. I \nwant to add my voice in support of Governor Ridge because I have known \nhim a long time and have firsthand experience as to his competency, and \nto express my concerns about the operation of the Department as we move \nahead on this very vital war against terrorism.\n  I thank the chairwoman and yield the floor.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania for \nhis comments, for his introduction of Governor Ridge at the hearing \nlast Friday, and for his participation as a member of the committee. We \nare indeed fortunate to have the benefit of his expertise.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that after the Senator from \nNorth Dakota delivers his remarks, the Senator from Alabama be \nrecognized next for as long as he needs, with a limit of 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, first let me say I am pleased to announce \nthat I will vote for Governor Ridge, to confirm Governor Ridge for the \nposition of Secretary of Homeland Security.\n  I have known Governor Ridge for a long while. I served with him in \nthe House of Representatives. I think he is a public servant with great \nskill and great dedication. I am very pleased to see him continue to \noffer himself for public service. I am very pleased to cast a vote in \nfavor of his nomination. It is a good one. I commend President Bush for \nsending it to us. And I think he will be confirmed overwhelmingly by \nthe Senate, if not unanimously.\n\n  Let me, however, say there are several things I am concerned about \nwith respect to homeland security. And it mirrors some of the \nsuggestions offered by my colleague just moments ago.\n  I want to say--as I indicate I am proud to vote for Governor Ridge--\nthere are three areas I hope very much we will make some significant \nimprovements in and for. Let me describe them.\n  First and foremost for me is information sharing. The task force \nheaded by former Senators Warren Rudman and Gary Hart, on October 25, \nissued a report to this country. The report was titled ``America Still \nUnprepared--America Still in Danger.'' It was a bipartisan task force \nsponsored by the Council of Foreign Relations, which included former \nSecretaries of State George Shultz and Warren Christopher; retired ADM \nWilliam Crowe, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; and many \nothers.\n  They found that 1 year after the September 11 attacks, America \nremains dangerously unprepared for another terrorist attack. At the top \nof their concerns--the top of their list--was this:\n\n       650,000 local and state police officials continue to \n     operate in a virtual intelligence vacuum, without access to a \n     terrorist watch list provided by the U.S. Department of State \n     that goes to immigration and consular officials.\n\n  Let me say that again. The watch list--the list that the Department \nof State has, that has on it names of terrorists and suspected \nterrorists--that list is not available to State and local law \nenforcement officials across this country. And the Rudman-Hart report \nsays you have 650,000 additional eyes and ears out there in law \nenforcement that ought to be able to access that report.\n  To give you an example, 36 hours before September 11 and those \ndevastating attacks, one of the hijackers, Ziad Jarrah, a 26-year-old \nLebanese national, who was flying the airplane that crashed in \nPennsylvania, was pulled over on Interstate 95 in the State of Maryland \nby a Maryland State Police trooper for driving 90 miles an hour. He was \none of the key organizers of the al-Qaida terrorist cell formed in \nGermany 3 years ago. He shared a Hamburg apartment with Mohammed Atta. \nAnd he was at the controls of flight 93.\n  When this hijacker was pulled over by a Maryland trooper, he was \ndriving a rented car under his own name. This hijacker, it turns out, \nwas not on the watch list. But if he had been--and there is no reason \nto think he would not have been, given today's circumstances--that \nMaryland trooper\n\n[[Page S1311]]\n\nwould have had no idea and no access to the information that he had \njust pulled over someone who was a known terrorist, a suspected \nterrorist.\n  If this afternoon, in Fargo, ND, a city police officer or a county \nsheriff or a highway patrolman pulls over an automobile, and it is \nfilled with four people who snuck across the United States-Canadian \nborder in some remote area of our country, and those four people are on \nthe terrorist watch list, a list compiled by the State Department, that \ncity police officer or county sheriff will have no access to that \ninformation. They can call in and get the NCIC and find out who has \nbeen convicted of a felony and who has outstanding warrants, but they \nare not able to get to the names on the State Department's watch list \nof who the terrorists are, the known terrorists and suspected \nterrorists. That is unforgivable, in my judgment.\n\n  Let me read a detailed excerpt from the Hart-Rudman report:\n\n       With just fifty-six field offices around the nation, the \n     burden of identifying and intercepting terrorists in our \n     midst is a task well beyond the scope of the FBI. This burden \n     could and should be shared with 650,000 local, county, and \n     state law enforcement officers, but they clearly cannot lend \n     a hand in [the] counterterrorism information void [that now \n     exists because] when it comes to combating terrorism, the \n     police officers on the beat are effectively operating deaf, \n     dumb, and blind.\n\n  Why? Because we have a list with the names of terrorists on it, and \nthe names of suspected terrorists on it, and the police officers and \nthe county sheriffs and the highway patrolmen have no access to that \nlist and are not allowed to have access to that list. That is wrong.\n  Let me continue quoting from the Hart-Rudman report:\n\n       Terrorist watch lists provided by the U.S. Department of \n     State to [the U.S.] immigration [folks] and consular \n     officials are still out of bounds for state and local police. \n     In the interim period as information sharing issues get \n     worked out, known terrorists will be free to move about to \n     plan and execute their attacks.\n\n  Even when they are stopped by local police officers, and even when \ntheir names are run against the NCIC, those local law enforcement \nofficials have no ability, no capability, to run those names against \nthe watch list that contains the names of terrorists and suspected \nterrorists.\n  This needs to get fixed. I hope Governor Ridge makes this a first \npriority. This was the top recommendation of this blue ribbon \ncommission that says America is unprepared. This was their top \nrecommendation. And months after it was issued, to the best I can \nunderstand, very little is happening in the administration to resolve \nthis. I believe very strongly it needs to be resolved, and soon.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eight and a half minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me make two additional points.\n  One of them is a point I have made many times on the floor of the \nSenate, and that is the issue of container security. We are spending \nabout $8 billion to do something called a national missile defense \nplan, so that if there is an intercontinental ballistic missile aimed \nat the United States, and shot at us by a terrorist somewhere in the \nworld, we can send up another missile, and with our $8 billion, we will \nhit a bullet with a bullet. That is the proposition, in any event.\n  It is very unlikely, of course, that a terrorist group is going to \nhave access to an intercontinental ballistic missile, but we are \nspending $8 billion dealing with that and rogue states having access to \nthose missiles.\n  A more likely threat, according to most people, is not a 15,000-mile-\nan-hour missile aimed at our country with a nuclear warhead; a more \nlikely threat is a container on a container ship, slowly but surely, at \n2 miles an hour, pulling up to a dock in New York City or Los Angeles \nor San Diego or Seattle, with a container in the middle of all the \ncontainers on that ship containing a dirty bomb or a nuclear weapon.\n  Mr. President, 5.7 million of those containers come into this country \neach and every year; 100,000 of them are inspected, 5.6 million are \nnot.\n  I happen to have toured a port a couple of times. I come from a State \nthat is landlocked. I do not know much about ports, so I have done a \ncouple tours. I have great admiration for Customs and others working on \nthose docks, in those ports. During a tour, I recall asking them: What \nis in this container? They said: We don't know, but let us show you \nwhat we're doing with some containers. They took me to a garage-like \nstructure and opened one container that had frozen broccoli from \nPoland. That was the first time I had seen frozen broccoli from Poland \nin 100-pound bags, destined, I suppose, for the restaurants across \nAmerica.\n  They pulled out a couple bags and opened them. Sure enough, it was \nfrozen broccoli from Poland. I asked: How do you know what is in the \nmiddle bag in the middle of this container? They said: We don't. I \nasked: How many of these do you inspect? They said: Two percent of all \ncontainers we inspect.\n  The fact is, we need to do better because our ports, our big cities \nare under threat of terrorist acts, where terrorists using a container, \nput in a container ship, could come into one of our ports with a weapon \nof mass destruction immersed in one of those containers.\n  We have heard about the suspected terrorist who actually put himself \nin a container and put himself on a container ship, took with him some \nwater, something to sleep on, a cot, a computer, wireless satellite \ntelephones, and food, and then shipped himself to Toronto, Canada, \nprobably with the intention of going from the Middle East to Canada and \nthen sneaking into this country. But the point is, he was discovered. \nBut he put himself in a container on a container ship with all the \ncomforts of home, shipping himself to Canada.\n  My point is, if we care about the security of this country and care \nabout defeating terrorists, care about identifying and thwarting \nterrorist acts, then we have to care a great deal about port security.\n  The fact is, we are not funding it. This bill that is before us has \ncut funding once again. People say we are adding funding. The fact is, \nwe have cut the funding that the Customs Service says they need. It has \njust been cut. And we try to add it back, and we lose the vote.\n  But, look, this isn't about spending; it is about protecting our \ncountry. We cannot turn a blind eye to port security and say that \nsomehow we have done what is necessary to defend this country. I hope \nGovernor Ridge comes in and understands that is a very difficult issue \nbut one that we have to address in a very aggressive way.\n  Finally, let me talk about northern border security, border security \ngenerally but northern border security specifically.\n  With respect to our borders, it is true that a country cannot defend \nitself if it does not control its borders. It is the case, for example, \nthat we have had 10 times as many Border Patrol agents on the southern \nborder between the United States and Mexico as we have had on the \nnorthern border. We have done that for many years because of \nimmigration and drug problems.\n  The fact is, the danger today is more than just that. The danger \ntoday is the potential of terrorists sneaking into this country and \ncommitting an act of terrorism. We have 4 or 5,000 miles of border \nbetween the United States and Canada, a long border between two \ncountries that get along well.\n  Up in my part of the country where we have border stations in the \nnorthern part of North Dakota, those stations close in many cases at 10 \nat night. Up until a year or so ago, the only thing that existed, once \nthose stations closed, was an orange cone in the middle of the road. \nThe impolite people who snuck into this country could shred that cone \nat 60 miles an hour. The polite ones at least stopped to remove the \ncone and put it back in place.\n  We have changed some of that but not enough. This is a long, porous \nborder. If this country is going to provide the security it needs for \nthe American people, then it has to have control of its borders. That \nmeans we have to fund the Customs Service, the Immigration Service, and \nthe Border Patrol and have the coordination of those agencies that work \ntogether to do the job they know needs doing.\n  I am pleased to support Governor Ridge. I have great confidence in \nhim. He is a great public servant. I am proud to say yes when they call \nthe vote. He needs the tools. This man needs the\n\n[[Page S1312]]\n\ntools to do the job. You can't provide the kind of support we need for \nthis country and the kind of investment we need to make sure we have \nsecurity at our ports and airports, nuclear facilities, trains, and so \non, you can't do that on the cheap.\n  One day--I pray this will not happen--another terrorist act may occur \nand something that we have failed to do here, something that we know we \nshould have done will be pointed out as a flaw in the system. They knew \nthis could happen, but they didn't do anything about it.\n  Let's make these investments now: Port security, watch lists, giving \naccess to all of the law enforcement people, the names of terrorists \nand suspected terrorists, border security. Yes, at the southern border \nbut also the northern border. Let's do these things together. We know \nright now that Osama bin Laden is somewhere in this world. At least we \nare told they think he is still alive.\n  Osama has been forgotten by some. The fact is, Osama bin Laden is a \ndangerous guy. We don't know where he is. We don't know where Omar is. \nThe terrorist al-Qaida cells are still a very serious problem. Homeland \nsecurity is critically important. That is why I support this \nnomination.\n  This nominee is a quality person who can do this job, but he can't do \nthis job without the tools. We, the administration and the Congress, \nhave to own up to that and make the investments necessary that will \nprotect this country against the threat of terrorists.\n  Just a couple of months ago, the head of the FBI said the danger of a \nterrorist attack is as high today or higher than it was September 10, \nthe day before the devastating terrorist attacks.\n  I am proud to vote for Governor Ridge. I wish him well. I want to \nhelp him. I hope this administration and this Congress will do what is \nright to make the investments necessary to protect our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that after the \nSenator from Alabama has concluded his remarks, the Senator from \nNebraska be recognized for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise to express my admiration for \nGovernor Ridge. I have over the weeks and months observed him in his \nleadership role. I believe he has performed exceptionally well. This \nNation was attacked on September 11. We remember that vividly. We also \nremember the Nation's determination to do a better job of protecting \nour homeland.\n  The President looked all over the country. He picked somebody to lead \nthe effort to bring together State and local and Federal agencies in a \nway that would enhance dramatically our ability to be safe from \nterrorist attack. It was not talk he wanted; he wanted leadership, he \nwanted action. So, he created the Office of Homeland Security in the \nWhite House right next to him.\n  He chose to head that critical agency someone he knew, someone he had \ngrown to respect as a fellow Governor who had a record of achievement \nand excellence and professionalism. He chose a man who understood State \nagencies as well as Federal agencies. He chose a man who served in the \nU.S. Congress and who had served in the military, winning combat medals \nfor his actions in Vietnam. He chose the kind of person we needed at \nthat time.\n  It was a thankless task. Many said it could not be done. Many said we \nwould not be able to prevent further attacks. Anybody taking that job \nhad to know that they were taking great personal risk because anything \nthat did happen would be their fault. They would have to answer for it.\n  I am so impressed with Governor Ridge. He took charge aggressively. \nHe changed the way this Government did business. He took control of the \nsituation by meeting with the heads of the Government agencies.\n  I used to be a Federal prosecutor for 15 years. I worked with the FBI \nand the DEA and Customs and the Coast Guard and all those Federal \nagencies--ATF, Secret Service, all of them. They act at times like \nforeign nations. They produce memoranda of understanding that are like \ntreaties. It is difficult to make a move. They have their own agendas. \nThey are charged by Congress to do A and B and C, and they are not \ninterested in doing D. Maybe they should.\n\n  Tom Ridge took charge and dealt with the leadership of those \nagencies. Barriers were broken down to an unprecedented degree. Despite \nobvious results that we wish had been achieved but were not able to be \naccomplished, tremendous things were accomplished under the President's \nunequivocal leadership and the efficiency and leadership of Governor \nRidge. I am proud of Tom and excited to have him take on that job.\n  Now that we have moved to the Department of Homeland Security with \n170,000 people, I want to say this--I have shared this thought with \nhim; I think he comprehends it--this Congress is not moving blocks and \ndepartments and governmental entities all cobbled together into some \ngiant agency and just expecting it to be better than it was before. The \nvery fact they are now one agency with one mission, should on balance \nclearly make the Department more efficient in our fight against terror. \nThey have individual institutional biases and tendencies that may not \nbe perfectly compatible with this new agency. It is going to take \nstrong leadership. We don't need excessive administration.\n  I expect and believe and am excited about the potential for Governor \nRidge to use the force of his will, to use the mandate this Congress \nhas given him, to use the confidence and support the President has in \nhim to make sure those agencies realize, when they come together, that \nit is now a new organization, and we expect the greatest efficiency \npossible.\n  We expect the mission we have assigned to this agency will be the No. \n1 guiding factor to make America safe, and we want them not to focus on \nbureaucracies and special interests and labor rules, but focus on \nmaking this country safe. I believe Governor Ridge understands that \nmission, and he is going to work with the employees to reach a higher \ndegree of productivity than we have ever had.\n  I thank Senator Collins for her leadership. She is a master of this \nsubject and has worked so hard at it. I will not say anymore. I am \nexcited about the potential of this agency. We would like to see, \nfrankly, this agency set a new standard for governmental efficiency and \nproductivity. There is an opportunity here to do better. I believe we \ncan. I am excited, and I will be supporting Governor Ridge.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maine \nfor the opportunity to address the nomination of my good friend, \nGovernor Ridge, for this important position that has been created to \ntake care of homeland security.\n  I rise in support of the nomination for a number of reasons. While we \nwere Governors, for 4 years we worked together within the Governors \nAssociation to make sure our States were taken care of; that the \neconomies of the States were directed in an appropriate fashion; that \nwe worked together to make clear the State issues before the Congress \nof the United States.\n  In that experience, I had the opportunity to see firsthand Governor \nRidge at work for the benefit of his State and for our country. In the \nlast few months, I have had that same experience of seeing him at work \nin his new role of developing the homeland security strategy, the \nhomeland security approach that I think will truly bring about homeland \nsecurity.\n  His background enables him in a very unique way to bring together \nlocal, State, and Federal agencies. It is truly an honor for me to be \nhere today to say I am proud to support his nomination, and I look \nforward to working with him.\n  Last year, as we were finishing up the second session of the 107th \nCongress, Governor Ridge came to Nebraska and looked at the University \nof Nebraska Medical Center as a possible site for a biomedical \nlaboratory as part of the homeland security effort to make sure we have \nthe capacity to deal with any kind of bioterrorism that would require \nmedical treatment and\n\n[[Page S1313]]\n\nfor the detection of bioterrorist activity.\n  While he was there, we had an opportunity to look at the facility but \nI think in a broader sense of what we need to have in terms of \nlaboratories around the country to work with the CDC and to work with \nothers in this new role.\n\n  At the end of the year, we also had what appeared to be somewhat of a \ngrab for one of those institutions in another part of our country. The \nthen-majority leader agreed with a number of us that we would have a \nway to deal with this in a compromise this year. That majority leader \npassed it on to Senator Frist, the new majority leader, to work this \nthrough.\n  A good-faith effort has been made--I am not totally convinced the \nlanguage is as strong as I would like to see it, but clearly a good-\nfaith effort has been made to resolve this issue so that the playing \nfield is level so other institutions will be able to compete fairly to \nhave the biomedical lab in their location based on the criteria.\n  To give an idea of how strong and supportive I am of Governor Ridge, \nI have been supportive of giving him, if you will, the total authority \nto set the criteria so that we do not set the criteria by law but he \ncan by rule and regulation set the criteria and make the determination. \nThat is the kind of support I think this gentleman will have from this \nCongress in so many different ways because of what he has been able to \nshow and reflect in his work thus far. There will be total support \nalong the way.\n  I am looking forward to the days ahead to work with Governor Ridge as \nhe becomes Secretary Ridge in this very important responsibility.\n  On another matter related to this--and I do not come to the floor \nvery often to talk about partisan politics or to respond to those \npartisan arguments that are sometimes made. I think typically they tend \nto derail us, distract us, and detract from the subject of the day. So \nyesterday when I heard someone talking about a partisan deficit as \nopposed to a deficit because some of us were supportive of \nfirefighters, some of us were supportive of first responders and of \npolice officers on the spot--recognizing that we ought not to simply \nhave our pictures taken with these first responders as a matter of \npublicity or as a matter of PR; what we should, in fact, do is make \nsure we are supporting them financially--I was dismayed by what I heard \nand what I saw on a chart.\n  I wish to respond today because I think if we are going to focus on \nwhat homeland security is about, what Governor Ridge is focused on, it \nis about hometown security. If we are not secure in our hometowns, if \nwe are not supportive financially in every way we possibly can, if we \nare not responding at the hometown level, the police officers, the \nfirefighters, and the first responders of the emergency service workers \nand all those who protect our water supply and who protect our food \nsupply, we are not going to have homeland security. That is what it has \nbeen about these last several days. We may have different ideas about \ndoing it, we may have a different philosophy whether we do it through \nthis budget or whether we do it in another budget, but that is \ndifferent than to say it is a growing partisan deficit caused by one \ngroup versus another.\n  If we are not going to support our firefighters and we are not going \nto support our police officers at the local level, then we ought not \nsay we are for homeland security. One cannot be for homeland security \nif one is not for hometown security.\n  The fact is, there may be disagreements, but I think we ought to set \naside the partisan rhetoric and work together to find a way to fund \nthese very important services rather than to talk in a global sense, in \na broad sense about homeland security. It sounds great, but the only \nway it works is if we are focused on what is happening in Charlotte, \nNC, what is happening in Lincoln, NE, what is happening in Bangor, ME--\nwhat is happening in the localities across our country. If we do not \nhave security at the local level, this homeland is not secure, and none \nof us are truly safe.\n\n  I thank the Chair. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that for the \nremainder of the debate on the nomination of Tom Ridge to be the new \nSecretary of Homeland Security, that any quorum calls be charged \nequally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that 2 minutes of \nthe time set aside for Senator Lieberman be allotted to me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, Tom Ridge and I came together to \nWashington in 1982. We were new Members of Congress 20-plus years ago. \nHe was a fine Member of Congress. He had the ability to work across \nparty lines. When he became Governor of the State of Pennsylvania, I \nwas excited for him. From all reports I have been able to obtain, he \ndid a good job as Governor of the State of Pennsylvania.\n  When President Bush suggested he be head of the program to protect \nthe American people from terrorists, I told the President I thought it \nwas a good appointment, and I told Governor Ridge I thought it was \nimportant he make the change from becoming Governor to becoming the \nhead of the new Department of Homeland Security.\n  His job has now been created as a Cabinet-level office, and I think \nTom Ridge has earned his stripes. There are things he has done I have \nnot totally agreed with, but most everything he has done I have agreed.\n  When he became head of this Department, I told Tom Ridge I would sit \nback and not cry out for a Cabinet-level office, but the determination \nwas made by him, the President, and many others that there needed to be \na Cabinet-level office created. I am glad that has happened. Tom Ridge \nwill be a fine Secretary. He is a good man. He will have awesome \nresponsibilities. This will not be an easy task. Secretary Ridge has \nthe difficult job of merging the many departments, agencies and offices \nthat now comprise the Department of Homeland Security.\n\n  I stand ready to help him as he seeks to complete this monumental \nundertaking.\n  We simply must not rest because we passed legislation to create the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. This law provides the framework for \nthe new department, but only the new Secretary can take the pieces of \nthe new department and make them function as a single, committed \nagency.\n  In Nevada, we still have daunting challenges and unfulfilled \nopportunities. I look forward to working with Governor Ridge to address \nthese.\n  In particular, Nevada is faced with diminishing Federal resources and \nincreasing State budget deficits at the same time that it must address \nnew homeland security responsibilities. In fact, Nevada ranks near the \nbottom in the country in terms of funding for State homeland security \nefforts. With millions of tourists each year, this places an extra \nburden on Nevada. Most funding for emergency responders is based on \npopulation. But population alone does not determine the vulnerability \nof a city like Las Vegas.\n  At the Nevada Test Site, Nevada also has one of the Nation's premier \ncenters for training emergency responders and other special counter-\nterrorism forces. Last February, Governor Ridge accepted my invitation \nand came to Nevada to observe the excellent training and counter-\nterrorism facilities at the Nevada Test Site. In the coming year, I \nlook forward to having Governor Ridge\n\n[[Page S1314]]\n\nreturn and putting the full resources of the administration behind his \nproject.\n  Protecting our nation from a future terrorist attacks will not be an \neasy task. Having a Secretary for the Homeland Security Department in \nplace will ensure that the process of building the new Department \nbegins soon.\n  As we continue to develop this new department, I look forward to \nworking with Governor Ridge to ensure our Nation is secure.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina). The clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the time during the quorum \ncall be charged equally against both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the understanding of the Chair.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote on \nthe nomination of Tom Ridge occur at 12:10 today, with all the other \nparameters for debate remaining. Further, I ask unanimous consent that \nimmediately following the vote, the Senate then stand in recess until \n2:15 today. Finally, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate \nreconvenes at 2:15 today, there be 5 minutes for debate equally divided \nbetween Senators Nickles and Reed or their designees prior to the \nscheduled vote.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would add we are moving action along quite \nwell. We have a number of amendments pending after we dispose of the \nReed of Rhode Island amendment. We are working with Senator Stevens to \nget a number of votes lined up for later this afternoon. We are going \nto go to the agriculture amendment soon. That is in the previous order.\n  I have had a number of inquiries made. We will probably be in late \ntonight; that means later than 7 p.m. or so. People will have to \ncooperate if they have amendments to offer. I hope they will limit the \ntime on these amendments. The two leaders have spoken at some length \ntoday about trying to move this along. I hope people will cooperate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today I look forward to the Senate's speedy \nconfirmation of Governor Ridge to be the new Secretary of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. I believe that Governor Ridge is the \nright person for the job, and I strongly support his selection to head \nthe new department.\n  The challenge before Governor Ridge is massive: 22 agencies with over \n170,000 people must be reassembled under one umbrella. These agencies \nand their personnel need to communicate with each other, to work \ntogether, and to begin retooling their operations to increase the \nprotections needed to secure America's safety and well-being. Again, it \nis a massive job.\n  But Governor Ridge is not the only one who needs to roll up his \nsleeves. The Congress also has work to do on homeland security, first \nby enacting legislative repairs to the Homeland Security Act. This Act \npassed at the end of the last Congress using a hastily written bill \nthat discarded many important provisions that had been worked out on a \nbipartisan basis. My colleagues and I identified a number of these \nproblems during Governor Ridge's confirmation hearing before the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee last week.\n  First, the Homeland Security Act leaves the intelligence community \nwithout clearly defined roles and creates the possibility for \nunnecessary and costly duplication of effort. Language addressing the \ncoordination and analysis of intelligence issues was included in the \nbipartisan bill reported out of the Senate Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, but the key language was dropped from the final Homeland \nSecurity Act. The goal of this language was to lay out clearly which \nagency had primary responsibility for analyzing information about \nforeign intelligence, and avoid having the new Department of Homeland \nSecurity duplicate the work of the Counter Terrorist Center, or CTC, at \nthe CIA. Specifically, the language would have provided that the CTC \nhas the primary responsibility for analysis of foreign intelligence and \ngave the DHS the primary responsibility of taking that foreign \nintelligence and mapping it against threats to the U.S.\n  At his confirmation hearing, Governor Ridge indicated that he agreed \nwith maintaining the CTC's primary role on analyzing foreign \nintelligence. In fact, when I asked Governor Ridge: ``Will you \nduplicate the CTC?'' he responded: ``It is not our intention to \nreplicate the CTC with respect to foreign intelligence. Our intention \nis to use foreign intelligence from the CTC to match threats with \nvulnerabilities.'' When asked which agency was intended to have primary \nresponsibility to analyze foreign intelligence, Governor Ridge \nresponded: ``the CIA.'' Those were precisely the answers in the \nbipartisan Senate approach.\n  On January 18, the Washington Post reported that President Bush had \ndecided to ``leave responsibility for collecting and analyzing foreign \nintelligence on terrorists with the CIA, and to have the homeland \nsecurity agency perform further analysis aimed at protecting U.S. \ninfrastructure.'' Again, this is exactly the approach taken in the \nearlier, bipartisan Senate bill. I am hopeful that the Department will \ncontinue to follow the framework set out by the President and Governor \nRidge, and that he and the Congress will take any steps needed to \nrestore the clear language on intelligence responsibilities in the \nHomeland Security Act.\n  A second problem I have with the Homeland Security Act is the section \nof the law that exempts the agency from complying with some aspects of \nthe Freedom of Information Act, FOIA, the key Federal statute helping \nthe public keep track of what their government is doing. Government \nbureaucrats often don't like FOIA requests because they take time and \nresources to answer. Many would like to reduce the public's right to \nknow.\n\n  That's what happened in the Homeland Security Act. Language was added \nto that law that unnecessarily limits the use of FOIA.\n  Last year, Senators Leahy, Bennett, and I worked out a FOIA \ncompromise which was included in the original Senate Governmental \nAffairs Committee bill. At the homeland security mark-up, we were told \nthat the Administration supported our compromise language. But this \ncompromise was ultimately dropped. Instead, the Homeland Security Act \ncuts back on the public's right to know what its government is up to by \nexpanding the types of information that the new department can keep \nshielded from the public, including unclassified information about \n``critical infrastructure'' issues involving such matters as electrical \ngrids, computer systems, or water treatment facilities.\n  There is a related problem with the HSA language barring use of \ncritical infrastructure information in civil proceedings. Suppose the \nDHS gets information submitted by a chemical company indicating a \nchemical plant is in danger of releasing a toxic gas due to a \nvulnerability in its critical infrastructure. The statute ties the \nhands of the DHS, barring it from disclosing the information in court \nwithout the chemical company's consent. The statute even bars the DHS \nfrom giving the information to another agency such as the Environmental \nProtection Agency, EPA.\n  What's more, a whistleblower within the DHS or the EPA could be \nthrown in jail for disclosing this unclassified information. Even a \nmember of Congress who releases the information presumably could be, \nunder some circumstances, jailed! I find this to be incredible. \nLimiting the public's right to know and jailing whistleblowers isn't \nthe direction we should be going and is not necessary to protect \nAmerica.\n  At the Governmental Affairs hearing, Governor Ridge seemed to agree \nthat\n\n[[Page S1315]]\n\ncriminalizing whistleblower disclosures of unclassified critical \ninfrastructure information was not the intent of the Homeland Security \nAct. I am hopeful that Governor Ridge will help us to remedy some of \nthe FOIA problems caused by the Homeland Security Act and restore the \nbipartisan compromise worked out in our committee.\n  Another problem requiring prompt action is to get adequate funding to \nthe agencies charged with homeland security. Because of the failure of \nCongress to pass appropriations bills, the key Federal agencies at the \nfront lines of protecting our homeland have gone underfunded in the \nfirst 3 months of this fiscal year. Now, the Republican majority has \ncome up with an Omnibus Appropriations bill that inadequately funds \nvital homeland security needs for FY 2003. For example, $362 million is \nnot provided to the INS for the Entry-Exit system, which would track \nthe arrival and departure of non U.S. citizens; $265 million is cut \nfrom the INS for construction of border security facilities; $92 \nmillion is not provided for FBI information technology enhancements; $8 \nmillion is cut from the Customs Service container security initiative; \nand $132 million is cut from FEMA first responders. I supported an \namendment in the Senate that would have provided $5 billion to address \nthese and other homeland security priorities in the Omnibus \nAppropriations bill which was defeated. By under funding homeland \nsecurity, and promising billions of dollars in tax cuts instead, we \nhave delayed the delivery of urgently needed dollars to the very \nagencies charged with protecting us from terrorist attacks. The \nadministration's priorities are misplaced and need to be corrected.\n  Finally, the Homeland Security Act authorizes funding for various \nhomeland security grants, such as grants for first responders and \ngrants for new science and technology equipment. People in Michigan and \nall our States are eager to gear up to fight terrorism, but it must be \na Federal/State partnership. It is unacceptable for us to simply tell \nthe States what they must do and then expect them to somehow find the \nmoney to take on new and vast responsibilities. One central office has \nto be designated as the place to find out about the Federal grants that \nwill be awarded and administered by the Homeland Security Department \nand all of its many components. And in the interim, it would be helpful \nfor the Department to provide numbers to call and people to contact who \ncan give out this information. In a meeting in my office, Governor \nRidge indicated that he agreed that an interim number would be helpful.\n  I look forward to a quick confirmation of Governor Ridge. I also call \non my colleagues to begin the work needed to remedy the remaining \nproblems with the Homeland Security Act.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the \nnomination of Governor Ridge to become the first Secretary of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security.\n  I do so with the utmost confidence in the personal integrity and \nprofessional ability of Governor Ridge. We in America should honor and \nsupport public servants who take on challenges as difficult and \ndaunting as this one. This will be one of the hardest, and, instantly, \none of the most important jobs in Government. We are in the midst of a \ncrisis. We are at war. Raising our guard is an urgent task, and it \nfalls to this new Secretary and those under his command to close our \nmany vulnerabilities as quickly and effectively as possible. I believe \nthat Governor Ridge, from his experience in the Congress, as Governor \nof Pennsylvania, and of course over the last year as the director of \nthe White House Office of Homeland Security, is very well prepared for \nthe job. I am confident that this Department, which I have worked hard \nfor over a year now to try to bring into being, will be in good hands.\n  But at the same time, I must express my deep doubts as to whether the \nadministration in which Governor Ridge serves has done enough to make \nthe Nation safer, and as to whether going forward it has the strong \nvision and strategy, as well as the necessary fiscal commitment, to \nimproving America's security.\n  Based on its design, the establishment of a Department of Homeland \nSecurity ought to be a great leap forward in our homeland defenses. We \nwill at long last consolidate more than two dozen agencies and offices \nand organize them in a logical, accountable, and strong chain of \ncommand. And at the top of the agency, we will have a single cabinet \nsecretary with budget authority who will be held accountable to the \nCongress and to the people.\n  But getting there from here is no small task. It is both a tremendous \nopportunity and a sobering responsibility. Creating this Department \nwill be the largest and most complex Federal Government reorganization \nsince the 1940s, and demands a strong partnership between Congress and \nthe executive branch.\n  Let me say for my part, as one who fought for the new Department for \nmore than a year, in the Governmental Affairs Committee and on the \nSenate floor, that I plan to do everything I can to ensure that the \nDepartment has the resources and the support it demands and deserves, \nbecause this is the most urgent responsibility our government has \ntoday. We must strive to do this together, across party lines. For \ngenerations, we in the Congress have managed to elevate support for our \narmed services above partisan politics, and we must do the same for \nhomeland security. At the same time, we must work together to oversee \nthe organization, the long-term strategy, and the day-to-day operations \nof the Department. That is our obligation to the American people. But I \nhave never been under the illusion that reorganization itself would, by \nitself, be the solution to our homeland security challenges. It was \nonly always the necessary first step. Having the right structure is no \nguarantee of success. We also need the right people, policies, \nprograms, and resources.\n  And in this area, the administration's homeland security efforts over \nthe past year and three months have left much to be desired and much to \nbe done. After many months of raising our guard, America is not nearly \nsafe enough. It is no exaggeration to say that the holes in our \ndefenses are not getting demonstrably smaller. According to almost \nevery independent assessment produced in the past few months, America \nremains dangerously vulnerable to terrorist attack. The most persuasive \nof these, in my view, was produced by Former Senators Hart and Rudman, \nthe men who, long before we were attacked, were calling for our \ngovernment to reshape itself to better guard against the threat of \nterrorism.\n  Last year, Senators Hart and Rudman headed a second task force \nintended to assess the progress made since September 11 and recommend \nurgent reforms. That task force released its report last October. I \nquote from its introduction: ``America remains dangerously unprepared \nto prevent and respond to a catastrophic terrorist attack on U.S. soil. \nIn all likelihood, the next attack will result in even greater \ncasualties and widespread disruption to American lives and the \neconomy.'' In our committee hearing last week, Governor Ridge indicated \nthat he fundamentally understands the amount of work we have left to \ndo. I appreciate that. He and I disagree about how much has been \naccomplished over the past year, but I am grateful we share the same \nunderstanding of the size and scope of the challenge that remains.\n\n  Let me repeat some of the hard facts about our remaining \nvulnerabilities: Our local and State law enforcement officials are \noperating in a virtual intelligence vacuum with no access to the \nterrorist watch lists that the State Department provides to our \nimmigration and consular officials. In the words of the Hart-Rudman \nreport, this means that, when it comes to combating terrorism, ``the \npolice officers on the beat are effectively operating deaf, dumb, and \nblind.'' That's unacceptable, and in my view, the administration has \ntaken very small steps at best to fix this problem; containers, ships, \ntrucks and trains entering the United States over our borders and \nthrough our ports are subject to hardly any examination. Of the 21,000 \nshipping containers that come through our ports every day, no more than \n2 percent, that's about 400, are inspected. The administration has \nbegun to address this problem, trying to balance the competing demands \nof security and commerce, but we remain dangerously at risk; our first \nresponders are unprepared for potential chemical or biological attacks. \nThey lack the necessary\n\n[[Page S1316]]\n\ntraining, and their communications systems are in most cases \nincompatible with one another. Again, I know the administration has \ntalked about fixing this problem, but solutions have yet to \nmaterialize; we must make better use of our National Guard's \neffectiveness and expertise here at home. I have put forward proposals \nsuggesting how our country can do that but again, I have heard few \nideas or directives from the White House on this front. We lack \neffective vaccines and medicines to counter the vast majority of \nbiological and chemical weapons. I have put forward comprehensive \nlegislation to spur the private sector development of these \ncountermeasures. Our attempts to engage the administration in a \nconversation on meeting this urgent need have fallen on deaf ears.\n  I believe it is unnerving and unacceptable that we have not come \nfurther faster. Bureaucratic inertia is a powerful force. That's why \nthe Homeland Security Act which we passed and the President signed \nneeds to be implemented boldly and aggressively.\n  Governor Ridge seems to understand this, upon being appointed the \nPresident's Homeland Security Advisor, said that, ``The only turf we \nshould be worried about protecting is the turf we stand on.'' And while \nhe has tried his best to honor that statement, I am not yet convinced \nthat the administration as a whole is prepared to live up to that \nrhetoric. Let me give you one crucial example of an area in which a \ngenerally reactive rather than proactive mindset is already producing \nserious problems: intelligence collection, dissemination, and analysis.\n  We now know that the failure of our intelligence agencies to connect \nthe dots on September 11 was the single greatest error among many \nglaring failures. Nevertheless, the Bush administration has thus far \nfailed to challenge or change the status quo of the intelligence \ncommunity to fix what is broken.\n  On paper, the passage of the new Homeland Security Act has ushered in \na new era. The bill creates a single all-source information analysis \nand infrastructure protection unit within the new Department. We had a \nlot of discussion and debate over the roles and responsibilities of \nthis new unit, would it be focused only on protecting critical \ninfrastructure, or would it be designed to help do what we didn't do \nbefore 9/11, namely ``connect the dots'' to prevent attacks before they \noccur. In the end we compromised: it would do both. But I am very \ndisturbed by indications that the administration believes the primary \nresponsibility of the new Department's intelligence unit is to protect \ncritical infrastructure, and that performing analysis to prevent \nattacks is peripheral or secondary at best.\n  The fact is, we can imagine horrific terrorist attacks that are not \nagainst critical infrastructure but against people, a bomb in a \nshopping mall or a biological agent dropped from overhead onto city \nstreets. It makes no sense for the Department of Homeland Security's \nintelligence division to put on critical infrastructure blinders rather \nthan assessing and processing all information related to terrorist \nattacks against Americans here at home.\n  This is an absolutely central question, not in any way a semantic \ndistinction. The question here is whether the new Department will \nsystematically work to prevent all terrorism, or whether it will have \nthe much narrower mission of protecting critical infrastructure.\n  During the long debate over the legislation creating a Department of \nHomeland Security, the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee held \nhearings focused specifically on the intelligence mission and \ninformation needs of the new Department. We analyzed the \nAdministration's original legislation and determined that the \ninformation analysis and infrastructure protection directorate it \nproposed was too narrowly focused and would not have the access to \ninformation it needed to ``connect the dots'', and therefore prevent \nfuture terrorist attacks. We proposed separate directorates for \nintelligence and for critical infrastructure which would be headed by \nseparate, Senate confirmed Under Secretaries. This was to make it clear \nthat the intelligence function in the Department would be focused on \nits full range of missions, preventing attacks, improving border \nsecurity, better informing our emergency response activities, and, yes, \nprotecting critical infrastructure.\n  The administration resisted this approach, and insisted that the \ndirectorate be headed by a single Under Secretary. However, they agreed \nthat separate Assistant Secretaries, one for information analysis and \nanother for infrastructure protection, would head up two distinct \nentities in the directorate. And it was clear that the Directorate \nwould be focused on detecting and preventing attacks, as well as \nprotecting critical infrastructure.\n  As a result the language in the Homeland Security Act reflects a \ncompromise. It makes clear that the mission of the Information Analysis \nand Infrastructure Protection Directorate includes detecting and \npreventing all terrorist threats against our country, not just those \nagainst critical infrastructure.\n  Regrettably, long after our deliberations finished, long after the \nbill was signed, the Administration has apparently now decided that no \ncompromise was reached, that the position in the President's original \nproposal was adopted by the Congress. Let me make clear: that is a \nfalse interpretation, and it is one which, if unchallenged, will mean \nthat the Department of Homeland Security will, from the beginning, have \nabdicated one of its most vital functions, that is preventing acts of \nterrorism against the American people.\n  The legislative history is clear, yet the administration is \napparently intent on creating an intelligence unit narrowly focused on \nprotecting only critical infrastructure, rather than preventing any and \nall acts of terrorism against the American people on our home soil. \nThis is not what we agreed to, and it is not what America needs. I will \ncontinue to insist that the administration fulfills the intent of the \nlegislation we passed.\n  Finally, let me say a few words about the critical problem of \ninsufficient funding, which has so far hamstrung and hobbled our \nefforts to better protect America. We have dozens of Federal agencies, \nincluding many that are being consolidated into the new Department of \nHomeland Security--that are in the midst of urgent work post-September \n11. The Coast Guard, Border Patrol and others need to train their \nemployees and invest in new technology. They need to pay bills for \nexpensive investments they have already made. But this administration \nisn't providing them with the necessary funding . . . and some in \nCongress are not rising to the challenge either.\n  Indeed, just last week on the Senate floor, the Republican leadership \nrejected a $5 billion package of investments in homeland security \nprograms.\n  The problem is especially pressing at the local level. Local and \nState first responders, who are also our first preventers of terrorism, \nare not getting the support they need, despite promise after promise \nfrom the administration. Late last year, the President inexplicably \nblocked $2.5 billion in emergency spending that could have gone to \nfederal agencies and state and local officials for their homeland \nsecurity efforts. That was wrong.\n  This war on terrorism cannot be won with wishful thinking. It will \ntake strong leadership and a lot of money. It will take real, not \nrhetorical, partnership among every layer and level of government. It \nwill take talent, training, and technology. And it will take tireless \neffort on the part of thousands of Federal employees.\n  All this will soon fall on Governor Ridge's broad shoulders. I do not \ndoubt his talent or his commitment to the job. I have confidence in his \ncompetence. But unless and until this administration strengthens its \nstrategy, corrects its long-term vision, and puts its money where its \nmouth is, and does all these things urgently, the hard work of a good \nman, and of the thousands of men and women in his charge, will not be \nenough to make America as safe as we must be.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today the Senate considers President Bush's \nnomination of Director Tom Ridge to be the first Secretary of the new \nDepartment of Homeland Security. The real question, however, is not \nwhether the Senate will support the new Department or Director Ridge. I \nhave no doubt that we will. Indeed, the proposal for establishing this \nDepartment\n\n[[Page S1317]]\n\nwas born in the Senate, and both that proposal and Director Ridge have \nenjoyed widespread bipartisan support even during the many months that \nPresident Bush was threatening to veto any new cabinet level Department \nof Homeland Security.\n  Rather, the real question today is whether the President will \ncontinue to support the new Department with more than words, or whether \nhaving used the Senate proposal for political purposes in the last \nelection, he will now simply disengage or move on to other matters.\n  The initial signs are not good. Even as we debate the confirmation of \nDirector Ridge, the administration is trying to push through Congress a \nmassive tax cut that will benefit most the wealthiest Americans at the \nsame time as massive spending cuts in vital homeland security measures. \nThese reductions include slashing grants to state and local first \nresponders as well as cutting FBI agents and FBI computer upgrades. \nThese are key homeland security measures.\n  When we voted to establish the new Department of Homeland Security, I \nwarned that it would not be enough to just shift agencies from one \nbuilding to another or to rewrite some boxes on an organizational flow \nchart. While reorganization was a good first step, I warned that reform \nwas what was needed, and it still is.\n  Reform is a much more difficult task than reorganization. It takes \npersistence and hard work, and reform cannot be accomplished by one \nbranch of government or one party working unilaterally. True and \nsuccessful reform will require us to work together. It will require \nRepublicans to work with Democrats in the Congress, and it will require \nthe President and the new Secretary of Homeland Security to work with \nthe Congress.\n  Unfortunately, the track record of the administration in working in a \nbipartisan manner with the Congress on the homeland security is not a \ngood one. When Director Ridge first assumed his current position, we in \nthe Senate were anxious to hear from him how the Administration was \nworking to protect the homeland. In fact, the Judiciary Committee was \nthe first Committee to invite him to testify after the 9/11 attacks. \nUnfortunately, for months, the administration refused to allow Director \nRidge to testify and tell Congress what he was doing. The President \nopposed establishing a new cabinet level department in part to avoid \nsuch Congressional oversight.\n  That position changed only after congressional oversight highlighted \nthe problems at our agencies charged with protecting our domestic \nsecurity from international terrorists. I remember well the day when \nthe President reversed his position and decided to support a new \nDepartment of Homeland Security. It was on the morning of June 6, 2002, \nwhen the Judiciary Committee was holding nationally televised hearings \nhighlighting the testimony of FBI whistleblower Coleen Rowley, who was \nselected as one of Time Magazine's ``People of the Year'' for 2002. \nMoments before we began our hearing, the White House announced that it \nwould support a new department, but the President's proposal was long \non rhetoric and short on details. Indeed, there was not even a written \nlegislative proposal when the President went on television that night \nto talk about his welcome change of heart.\n  Eventually, we got a very brief legislative proposal, but the \nadministration candidly admitted that it was a work in progress. Along \nwith that first draft came a promise from Director Ridge, who ran the \nAdministration's legislative effort, that ``We will work together on \nthis.'' Director Ridge repeated that promise when he testified before \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee on June 26, 2002, stating that he was \n``anxious to work with the Chairman and other members of the committee \nto assure that the concerns that [I had] raised are properly \naddressed.'' He assured us that ``[t]his Administration is ready to \nwork together with you in partnership to get the job done. This is our \npriority, and I believe it is yours as well.''\n  That is precisely what we in the Senate tried to do. We negotiated in \na bipartisan manner to work out our many differences on the bill. The \nwork was not easy.\n  For example, I worked with my friends Senator Levin, Senator \nLieberman and Senator Bennett to reach a responsible compromise on the \nadministration's proposal to gut the Freedom of Information Act with an \noverly broad exemption that would have given more protection to certain \ninformation handed over by private companies and businesses than we \ngive to classified government information. We reached a bipartisan \nagreement that satisfied both sides and the White House agreed to the \ncompromise language.\n  I also worked with Senator Grassley to address the omission of \nwhistleblower protections from the bill, and we crafted a bipartisan \namendment to actually improve existing whistleblower protections as a \nhomeland security measure. We also sought to include the bipartisan FBI \nReform bill in the measure so that we could do more than simply move \nthe deck chairs around in the homeland security measure. There were \nmany examples of such bipartisan efforts to address real problems in \nour Nation's domestic security and improve on the administration's \nbill.\n  Unfortunately, in the end, the administration did not keep the \npromise to ``work together'' on the homeland security bill. Instead, \nthe final bill was written by a small group of Republicans, working in \nsecret with the administration. The bill was quickly rammed through the \nHouse, which promptly adjourned so that no compromise or debate could \noccur between the two chambers. Our bipartisan FOIA agreement was \njettisoned and the overly broad administration proposal was inserted. \nThe administration's new FOIA-gutting law also for the first time \nmakes it a crime for any Federal Government employee, including Members \nof Congress and their staffs, to leak or disclose any private business \ninformation that the business wants to keep secret. Is this an effort \nto crimp congressional oversight and control the flow of information to \nthe American people? We will see how this administration wields this \nnew power.\n\n  The bipartisan FBI Reform Act was omitted from the administration's \nHomeland Security bill entirely. The bipartisan amendment strengthening \nwhistleblower protections was also left out so that current \nwhistleblower protection, with all of its flaws, simply applies to the \nnew Department. These protections will mean nothing without vigorous \nenforcement of these laws by the administration. The leadership of the \nnew Department and the Office of Special Counsel must work to encourage \na culture that does not punish whistleblowers, and the Congress, \nincluding the Judiciary Committee, must continue to vigorously oversee \nthe new and other administrative departments to make sure that this \nhappens. I appreciate Director Ridge's comments at last Friday's \nhearing before the Governmental Affairs Committee when he stated, \n``there's specific language in the statute that reminds the secretary \nand reminds everyone associated with the new Department that there \nshall be no reprisals for legitimate whistleblower activity.''\n  Gone too were other protections for the federal employees who have \nspent the last year and a half of their lives protecting our country \nagainst terrorist attack. Inserted, instead of these important security \nmeasures, were pet provisions benefitting Eli Lilly and Texas A, to \nname a few.\n  And now we hear a familiar promise. ``Don't worry. We will work \ntogether to reform.'' We will work to ``clarify'' the protections for \nvital whistleblowers; work to ensure that the best federal workers \ndon't leave the Department; work to make sure that the INS operates \nbetter and that the FBI reforms itself.\n  I only hope that, once he is confirmed, Secretary Ridge will work \nwith us in a bipartisan manner.\n  Our best defense against terrorism is improved communication and \ncoordination among local, State, and Federal authorities; and between \nthe U.S. and its allies. Through these efforts, led by the Federal \nGovernment and with the active assistance of many others in other \nlevels of government and in the private sector, we can enhance our \nprevention efforts, improve our response mechanisms, and at the same \ntime ensure that funds allotted for protection against terrorism are \nbeing used most effectively. Indeed, Governor Ridge\n\n[[Page S1318]]\n\nstated at the hearing before the Governmental Affairs Committee last \nFriday that ``all 50 states and territories have appointed homeland \nsecurity advisers that participate regularly in meetings at the White \nHouse and in bimonthly conference calls with the Office of Homeland \nSecurity.'' I appreciate that the local officials of Vermont will have \na ``single entry point to address many of the homeland security \nconcerns.''\n  At the same time that the Department of Homeland Security works to \nprotect the safety of Americans, it is essential that Secretary Ridge \nmakes sure to protect the freedoms of Americans. Recent press reports \nhave warned that the Department will turn into a ``supersnoop's dream'' \nbecause it will allow creation of a huge centralized grand database \ncontaining a dossier or profile of private transactions and \ncommunications that each American has had within the private sector and \nwith the government. Indeed, in section 201, the bill authorizes a new \nDirectorate for Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection to \ncollect and integrate information from government and private sector \nentities and to ``establish and utilize . . . data-mining and other \nadvanced analytical tools.'' In addition, in section 307, the bill \nauthorizes $500,000,000 next year to be spent by a new Homeland \nSecurity Advanced Research Projects Agency, HSARPA, to make grants to \ndevelop new surveillance and other technologies for use in detecting, \npreventing and responding to homeland security threats.\n  We do not want the Federal Government to become the proverbial ``big \nbrother'' while every local police and sheriff's office or foreign law \nenforcement agency to become ``little brothers.'' How much information \nshould be collected, on what activities and on whom, and then shared \nunder what circumstances, are all important questions that should be \nanswered with clear guidelines understandable by all Americans and \nmonitored by Congress, in its oversight role, and by court review to \ncurb abuses.\n  I appreciate Director Ridge's promise at last Friday's Governmental \nAffairs' Committee hearing that ``[a]ny new data-mining techniques or \nprograms to enhance information sharing and collecting must and will \nrespect the civil rights and civil liberties guaranteed to the American \npeople under our Constitution.''\n  The reorganization is done, but the hard work of reform lies ahead. \nThe FBI, the INS, and other important government agencies must improve \ntheir performance, and they need the support of both the Congress and \nthe Administration to do so. The new Department of Homeland Security \ncannot ``go it alone.'' The Congress now will have an imperative to \nmonitor vigilantly and responsibly the implementation of the new \nDepartment. It is essential that Governor Ridge work with Congress as \nthe Director of Homeland Security. Governor Ridge stated before the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee last Friday that he is ``going to do \n[his] very, very best to respond to whatever requests [he] get[s] from \nCongress of the United States, because we need to not only build this \nDepartment together, but we need to sustain and make sure that we work \ntogether to make it as effective as possible.'' We will hold him to \nthis promise.\n  We must work together to effect reform. It is time to match the \nrhetoric and make that promise come true. I offer my assistance and \nwish Director Ridge all the best in his new job. Too much depends on it \nfor Director Ridge to fail.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nnomination of Governor Tom Ridge as the first Secretary of the new \nDepartment of Homeland Security.\n  Sixteen months after the terrorists turned airliners into missiles \nand leveled the World Trade Center and damaged the Pentagon, the \ncreation of a Department of Homeland Security and the speedy \nconfirmation of Governor Ridge will contribute to the safety of our \nNation.\n  Today's confirmation comes after a long struggle over the granting of \nstatutory authority for a Department of Homeland Security. I was an \nearly proponent of statutory authority, recognizing that the additional \npowers of cabinet level authority were required for the individual \ntasked with our Nation's security.\n  After Governor Ridge was appointed last year, Paul C. Light, Director \nof Governmental Studies at the Brookings Institution, and I wrote two \nop-ed pieces for the Washington Post that evaluated the performance of \nGovernor Ridge as the director of the White House Office of Homeland \nSecurity. I will submit these for the Record.\n  What we found was that Governor Ridge was not able to do his job \nwithout statutory authority. While he had access to the information and \npeople needed to do his job, he lacked impact. Despite influence in the \nbudget and personnel process, the Governor's authority over the \noperations and management of the homeland security establishment was \nweak. Even with a talented staff, his input in selecting other key \nadministration personnel was unclear.\n  Mr. President, that is why today I am voting in favor of Mr. Ridge's \nconfirmation. While it is not a panacea to our Nation's security \nconcerns, it is a step in the right direction. Giving Governor Ridge \nthe authority to be in charge of the Department of Homeland Security \nwill provide him with the ability to order the changes required in our \nnewest security apparatus.\n  Ultimately, the reorganization of 22 agencies and 170,000 Federal \nemployees is going to take months, if not years, to accomplish. The \nreality is that Americans are still vulnerable to additional terrorist \nattacks and the Federal Government is not adequately preparing for that \nthreat.\n  Right now, we are relying heavily on the intelligence community and \nthe FBI as the front line in our battle against terrorism. And I remain \nconcerned about the FBI's lack of preparation and failure to answer \nsome of the most fundamental questions about suspected terrorists who \nsleep among us like how many operatives of terrorist groups are within \nour borders.\n  The sooner we act to have an agency that can coordinate and provide a \nclear line of authority for our nation's security, the better equipped \nwe will be to protect our nation.\n  I ask unanimous consent the op-ed pieces to which I referred be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Apr. 24, 2002]\n\n                        A New Job for Tom Ridge\n\n                   (By Bob Graham and Paul C. Light)\n\n       Last fall we set seven criteria for measuring Tom Ridge's \n     performance as President Bush's appointed director of \n     homeland security [``Tools for the Homeland Security Chief,'' \n     op-ed, Nov. 22]. Although we were skeptical about whether he \n     could do his job without statutory authority, members of \n     Congress decided to defer to the president, who said Ridge \n     should be given the benefit of the doubt to begin carrying \n     out his important mission.\n       Over six months into his task, Ridge has had both success \n     and frustration. He clearly has access to the information \n     needed to do his job, which was our first criterion for \n     evaluating his office. But that information is still muddy, \n     its sources many, and its usefulness often mixed--as \n     evidenced by the color-coded system of vague threat warnings \n     his office developed. Ridge has also had access to key \n     decision-makers such as the president, vice president and \n     attorney general, which was our second criterion. What he \n     apparently has not had is success in making his case on the \n     need for sweeping reorganization of the nation's troubled \n     homeland security agencies.\n       Unfortunately, no one knows for sure just what he believes \n     about the need for reorganization--as a White House staffer, \n     he has not been given permission to testify before Congress. \n     There are reports that he wants much more than mere tinkering \n     with the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), Border \n     Patrol, Customs Service and other agencies. If this is true, \n     he has not been successful in making his case. He may have \n     access, but what he truly needs is impact.\n       Ridge has had his greatest success in the budget and \n     personnel process, our third criterion. Homeland security \n     agencies such as the INS and Coast Guard would receive more \n     money and personnel under the new Bush budget than they could \n     ever have expected during ordinary times. But as Ridge has \n     argued in making the case against his testifying before the \n     Senate Appropriations Committee, he has no power to spend, \n     obligate, or audit money. At the end of the day, agencies \n     must put their trust in the president's budget office for the \n     dollars and personnel they need. That reduces Ridge's clout \n     in ensuring that those dollars will be spent in a manner \n     consistent with the overall plan for homeland security.\n       As for our fourth, fifth and sixth criteria--his staff, \n     executive office space, and role in\n\n[[Page S1319]]\n\n     selecting key presidential appointees--Ridge has had mixed \n     success. He is still running a minimalist, though apparently \n     talented, operation, and he is still looking for office space \n     within shouting distance of his home in the Old Executive \n     Office Building. But it is not at all clear that he has had a \n     role in selecting key personnel such as the new nominees to \n     be surgeon general or director of the National Institutes of \n     Health--both essential players in the fight against \n     bioterrorism.\n       Ridge does not have much say over the operations and \n     management of the homeland security establishment, which was \n     our seventh and final criterion. As the recent events at INS \n     suggest, homeland security depends on agencies' being \n     properly structured, staffed and led. The homeland security \n     workforce is willing and patriotic, but its organizational \n     infrastructure is weak. Yet Ridge can only stand on the \n     sidelines as the media reveal one weakness after another in \n     our security system. He can cajole, advise, influence, and \n     arm-twist, but he cannot order anyone to do anything for good \n     or ill.\n       Ridge himself may have made the most persuasive case for a \n     stronger office of homeland security in a little-noticed \n     speech recently. Appearing before an association of state and \n     local emergency management officials, Ridge talked about the \n     need for more coordination, better technology and simple \n     accountability.\n       ``As part of our consideration of the new 21st-century \n     border, we are presently considering a range of options that \n     goes from simply a new technology architecture that puts it \n     all on the same database to a series of consolidations that \n     could ultimately involve four or five departments,'' he told \n     the National Emergency Management Association. ``There is no \n     line of accountability. As you take a look at 21st-century \n     borders, you have got to have somebody in charge.''\n       We believe it is time to nominate Tom Ridge for that job, \n     both literally and figuratively.\n       The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee is ready to begin \n     moving a bill that will create a Cabinet-level Department of \n     Homeland Security, with its director to be confirmed by the \n     Senate. The need for that authority is clear as our war on \n     terrorism moves into the next phase.\n       Sen. Bob Graham (D-FL) is chairman of the Senate Select \n     Committee on Intelligence. Paul C. Light is vice president \n     and director of governmental studies at the Brookings \n     Institution.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Nov. 22, 2001]\n\n                 Tools for the Homeland Security Chief\n\n                   (By: Bob Graham and Paul C. Light)\n\n       Former Pennsylvania governor Tom Ridge has been on the job \n     as homeland security director a little less than a month and \n     a half now, and it is important to respect the president's \n     wish that he be given time to settle in before Congress \n     begins to move legislation to strengthen the authority Bush \n     assigned him in his executive order.\n       But it is also important to lay down some criteria for \n     evaluating his new office in the weeks and months ahead. \n     Americans need a yardstick against which to measure this \n     crucial job, while Congress can more responsibly assess \n     whether Ridge needs the additional powers that can be granted \n     only through permanent law.\n       These criteria range from the seemingly mundane to the \n     broadest of goals, but we're convinced that all will prove \n     important as Ridge finds his way in political and official \n     Washington.\n       1. Ridge needs to be first in line for information.\n       It's hard to tell just who gets information at what point \n     on the homeland security front. What we do know is that Ridge \n     needs to get the first call from the front lines, not the \n     last. He also needs to have access to all paper moving in and \n     out of the Oval Office, including all briefing documents from \n     the National Security Council, if he is to have any chance of \n     influencing key decisions.\n       2. He needs access to the principals.\n       The Office of Homeland Security cannot succeed if Ridge \n     can't call meetings with Cabinet members and the heads of the \n     agencies he coordinates. he should meet with his counterparts \n     in the Cabinet, not their deputies.\n       3. Ridge needs to be a gatekeeper in the budget and \n     personnel process.\n       Two things matter in bureaucratic politics: money and \n     people. If Ridge is to have any hope of persuading agencies \n     to work together, he must be able to influence the budget \n     process and the allocation of new employees. Without access \n     to these levers, his sole power rests on the president's \n     willingness to intervene on his behalf, which in turn rests \n     on Ridge's readiness to play this trump card.\n       Decisions are being made about the allocation of $20 \n     billion in emergency spending that Congress has approved for \n     homeland security. And the Office of Management and Budget is \n     making the key marks on fiscal 2003 budgets, including \n     dollars for new employees. If someone from the Office of \n     Homeland Security is not involved in those meetings, Ridge \n     will have lost a critical lever to force needed cooperation.\n       4. Ridge needs a permanent staff that owes its loyalty to \n     him, and him alone.\n       Ridge has made some very good appointments to his team, \n     several of which were announced Tuesday. But many of the \n     members of his staff are still ``detailees'' from a variety \n     of federal agencies, including some from agencies he has been \n     asked to oversee in his effort to build a strong homeland \n     defense. No matter where they come from, Ridge should ask all \n     those on his team, including temporary employees, to fill out \n     the same financial disclosure forms that other White House \n     staff must complete. That is part of ensuring the legitimacy \n     of his effort.\n       5. He needs a staff within shouting distance.\n       Ridge has been given an office in the West Wing, close to \n     the Oval Office and his longtime friend the president. But \n     most of his staff will be housed miles from the White House \n     or even the Old Executive Office Building, which former vice \n     president Walter Mondale once described as like being in \n     Baltimore. Ridge's staff could end up being distant players, \n     both literally and figuratively.\n       6. Ridge needs a say in the selection of appointees at the \n     agencies he oversees.\n       As of this week there were still 35 vacancies among the 164 \n     Senate-confirmed positions in agencies central to the war on \n     terrorism and homeland defense. Ridge should have a say in \n     choosing the 14 appointees yet to be named, including the \n     deputy director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, \n     the director of the National Institutes of Health and the \n     candidate for commissioner of the Food and Drug \n     Administration.\n       7. Ridge needs to be involved in all management reviews of \n     the homeland defense establishment.\n       Under the Government Performance and Results Act, every \n     federal agency is required to submit an annual performance \n     plan outlining its agenda for action. Ridge should be asked \n     to approve those plans, and should be given access to all \n     Office of Inspector General audits and investigations in any \n     of the agencies he coordinates. Ridge should be given a role \n     in helping rebuild the homeland security workforce and should \n     be consulted on all legislation regarding homeland security.\n       These criteria go to the essential questions of Tom Ridge's \n     ability to get what he needs, and the government's ability to \n     give what he asks.\n       On Oct. 8, the day he was sworn in, Ridge noted that he and \n     his office had been given ``an extraordinary mission,'' then \n     added: ``But we will carry it out.''\n       We hope he is given the right tools to do so.\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to offer my \nsupport for the confirmation of Governor Ridge as Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity. President Bush chose wisely when he nominated Tom Ridge to \nhead this new department. Governor Ridge's adeptness in politics won \nhim six terms as a United States Congressman and two terms as Governor \nof Pennsylvania. In both positions, he was praised for his intelligent \nleadership and attention to detail. His service in the military, in \nwhich he received a Bronze Star for Valor in Vietnam, only adds more \ncredit to his name.\n  While my colleagues can further attest to Mr. Ridge's \naccomplishments, I would like to focus my attention on the impact that \nHomeland Security has on my State, and I encourage Mr. Ridge to \nconsider Alaska's security as a means of enhancing National Security.\n  With nearly 50 percent of the total Coastline of the United States, \nAlaska has much to gain from the new Department of Homeland Security.\n  Our coastal communities rely on a free-flow of air and maritime \ntraffic to meet their daily needs. Any interruption in this traffic \ncould imperil our isolated communities.\n  Twenty percent of our Nation's domestic oil supply flows through the \nTrans-Alaska Pipeline, which spans some 800 miles from Prudhoe Bay in \nthe north, to Valdez in the south. The Valdez terminal is the \nnorthernmost ice-free port in the United States. Its protection, \ntherefore, is crucial to the safe and effective transport of Alaska \nCrude oil to the West Coast.\n  Another port of importance to my State is the Port of Anchorage. \nNearly 80 percent of all goods destined for Alaskan cities flow through \nthe Anchorage Port. These communities, many with populations smaller \nthan 100 people, rely on the Anchorage Port to remain open. Providing \nfor the security of the Port of Anchorage is essential to the well-\nbeing of the Alaskan people.\n  In addition to commerce, most of the people in Alaska's coastal \nregions rely on the Fishing industry for jobs, generating nearly half a \nbillion dollars for the State annually. With approximately 1200 \ngroundfish vessels operating in Alaskan waters, harvesting nearly 2 \nbillion pounds of groundfish every year for U.S. and foreign consumers, \nAlaska's position as a fish leader is unquestionable. Fishing in \nAlaskan waters is an issue of security. The ability to maintain our own \ndomestic food supply should be paramount to the new Department, and \nAlaska's role in its production is key.\n\n[[Page S1320]]\n\n  The safeguarding of these fishing vessels falls to the capable men \nand women of the U.S. Coast Guard, one of the new Department of \nHomeland Security's essential agencies. Although only 4 percent of the \nCoast Guard is stationed in Alaska, the Kodiak Coast Guard base is the \nlargest single Coast Guard installation in the country. It is \nimperative, for maritime law enforcement, search and rescue, and oil \nspill response that the Coast Guard maintains its mission in Alaska.\n  The focus of Homeland security is not limited to water, however, but \nencompasses all ports of entry. As an international hub, the Ted \nStevens Anchorage International Airport is the busiest cargo airport in \nthe country. Nine hours to most major destinations, the airport's \nlocation makes it an ideal crossroads for international trade, as well \nas for domestic travel and commerce. Airport security continues to be \nof great importance to this and other airports throughout Alaska.\n  Likewise, Alaska is home to four military bases---two air force \nbases, and two army bases--and new missile defense facilities. \nProtecting our military assets for national defense and future military \nengagements will require comprehensive planning with Governor Ridge and \nthe new Department of Homeland Security.\n  I look forward to working with the new Secretary to provide for the \nsecurity of this great Nation as well as for the State of Alaska.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, as a proud Pennsylvanian, I want to \nexpress my strong support for Governor Tom Ridge and to applaud the \nPresident for his nomination as the first Secretary for the Department \nof Homeland Security. Unfortunately, scheduling prevented me from \nintroducing Governor Ridge during the nomination hearing in the Senate \nGovernmental Affairs Committee. I would like to commend the Committee \nfor its expedited consideration of this important nomination in order \nto facilitate the establishment of this critical new agency and the \nSenate for the quick consideration of his nomination today.\n  Governor Ridge has served the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for many \nyears and the Nation since shortly after the tragic attacks of \nSeptember 11, 2001. This period of challenge has shown the greatness of \nour Nation in the immediate response of heroic Americans such as Todd \nBeamer and others who gave their lives flying over Pennsylvania in \nUnited Flight #93 and the many who have heeded the call to service and \nsacrifice since then. I would especially like to thank Governor Ridge \ntoday for heeding the President's call and agreeing to help in this new \nway to better prepare and protect our Nation from old and new threats \nin the midst of a changing world.\n  Governor Ridge was born in Munhall, PA, just outside of Pittsburgh \nand grew up in Erie in northwestern Pennsylvania. He graduated from \nHarvard University and then attended my alma mater, Dickinson School of \nLaw. He served in Vietnam as a staff sergeant in the U.S. Army and was \nawarded the Bronze Star for Valor. He practiced law in Erie after \ncompleting his law degree and then served as assistant district \nattorney. He was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1982 \nwhere he served 6 terms. He was then elected for two terms as Governor \nof Pennsylvania where he served from 1995-2001.\n  Governor Ridge has prepared well for this responsibility in his \nservice to Pennsylvania and his service to President Bush as the \nhomeland security advisor. We are fortunate that Tom has agreed to \nserve the country in this new way. I also want to congratulate his \nwife, Michele, and their two children. I strongly support his \nnomination and look forward to supporting him in his new responsibility \nas Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security and encourage all \nof my colleagues to support his confirmation.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, as we are all aware, the events of \nSeptember 11 have changed how we perceive our country and our own \nsafety. For over a half century, Americans have felt safe and secure \nbeing isolated by sheer distance from our enemies.\n  As we have all found, we are no longer safe inside the borders of our \nown country. We feel vulnerable, and we are vulnerable.\n  We must rethink how we do business and in doing so re-organize our \nGovernment to meet the challenges of the future. We did this with the \npassage of the Homeland Security bill. Now we must find strong \nleadership to help us manage this process.\n  I believe Governor Tom Ridge is immensely qualified to be the first \nSecretary of the new Department of Homeland Security, and to begin the \narduous tasks of securing our Nation against the threat of terrorism, \nnot to mention the challenge of consolidating 22 agencies into a \n170,000-employee-strong Department--the largest Government re-\norganization in 50 years.\n  Tom Ridge selflessly left his own political career as Governor of the \ngreat State of Pennsylvania, where he was his own boss, to become the \npoint man for President Bush on homeland security and now reporting to \n100 Senators.\n  We in Congress should all make an effort to work with Mr. Ridge. It \nwill be our job to give him the tools in order to do his job properly.\n  I look forward to working with Secretary Ridge and his new \norganization. As the Chairman of the Energy Committee, I plan to work \nwith the Department of Energy, particularly the National Nuclear \nSecurity Administration and our national labs to make sure they work \nclosely with Homeland Security. Our labs were born from the Manhattan \nProject during World War II and it is once again time for them to step \nto the plate and help our country defend itself.\n  As a Senator from a border State, I will work with Governor Ridge to \nmake sure that he gets the tools needed to do the job he was chosen \nfor. This will include: more funding for equipment at our land borders; \nadditional funding for personnel; additional funding for training; and \nadditional funding for industry/business partnership programs along the \nland border.\n  It will be important for the border enforcement agencies of the new \nDepartment to work with the private sector on both sides of the border \nand reward those partners who adopt strong internal controls designed \nto defeat terrorist access to our country.\n  It is also important that the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center \nwas transferred to the new Department. I will make sure that the \ntransition of that Bureau from Treasury to Homeland Security goes \nsmoothly. I know FLETC-Artesia, New Mexico will play a growing role in \nproviding the training to the men and women who protect our country.\n  I fully support the nomination of Governor Tom Ridge to be the first \nSecretary of the Department of Homeland Security.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the nomination \nof Governor Tom Ridge as Secretary of the newly created Department of \nHomeland Security, DHS, when the Senate votes later this morning to \nconfirm him.\n  The Governmental Affairs Committee held its hearing on Governor Ridge \non Friday and reported his nomination favorably later that afternoon. \nThe expedited action on Governor Ridge is an illustration that when the \nadministration seeks a consensus nominee from the start, the Senate can \nbe very accommodating. I hope that administration officials will keep \nthat in mind as they consider candidates for the Federal judiciary.\n  Governor Ridge brings strong qualifications and experience to the \njob. He is literally battle-tested. He has served as President Bush's \nfirst and only Director of Homeland Security. He has management \nexperience as the Governor of one of the Nation's larger States, \nPennsylvania. Moreover, he has served in Congress and so knows the \nimportance of the task we have, which is to provide adequate funding \nfor this new department and oversee its operations.\n  Having said that, his task is extraordinarily large and \nextraordinarily difficult. Governor Ridge will preside over the biggest \nFederal reorganization since the creation of the Department of Defense \nafter the end of World War II.\n  We feel compelled to create a Department of Homeland Security largely \nbecause of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. There were attacks on our soil \nbefore 9/11, but 9/11 has focused our Nation's attention much as the \nattack on Pearl Harbor did for the World War II generation.\n  We face a cunning and ruthless enemy determined to make our home\n\n[[Page S1321]]\n\nfront the front lines. We face an enemy that deliberately targets \ncivilians, not soldiers. We face an enemy that wants to disrupt our \nsociety by every means possible.\n  Keeping America safe will be an enormous challenge. Keeping America \nsafe without trampling on the civil liberties that make us a free \npeople will be an even bigger challenge.\n  The Department of Homeland Security's purpose is to prevent terrorist \nattacks within the U.S. and respond to such attacks that do occur. The \nDHS will consist of 22 agencies now scattered throughout the Federal \nGovernment and will contain four major divisions:\n  A division of information analysis and infrastructure protection, \nwhich will operate in concert with the Central Intelligence Agency \n(CIA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and other \nintelligence agencies to assess threats;\n  A division of science and technology that will develop and promote \nmeasures to defend against nuclear, chemical, or biological attacks;\n  A division of emergency preparedness and response--built on the \ncurrent Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)--which will prepare \nfor and respond to natural and man-made disasters; and\n  A division for border and transportation security that will encompass \nwhat is now the Customs Service, the Transportation Security \nAdministration, and the Border Patrol.\n\n  Additionally, the new Department will include the Secret Service, the \nCoast Guard, and a new Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services. \nThe Immigration and Naturalization Service is to be abolished and \nnearly all of its employees are being moved to the new Department from \nthe Justice Department. The bill would also move most of the Bureau of \nAlcohol, Tobacco and Firearms from the Treasury Department to the \nJustice Department and rename it the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, \nFirearms and Explosives. The new Department will also have an Office \nfor State and Local Coordination charged with helping state and local \ngovernments to implement the national strategy for combating terrorism.\n\n  So Governor Ridge must bring together 170,000 employees from \ndisparate agencies and manage a budget that now totals $20 billion and \nis expected to reach $31 billion by 2007. That is an enormous task.\n  We are operating on the premise that consolidating all of these \nagencies and programs under one roof is a good idea. That seems like a \nreasonable premise, but in all candor, we will have to wait and see.\n  I am concerned about what will happen to the non-DHS functions of \nagencies moved to the new Department, such as those of the Coast Guard \nand FEMA. I want to make sure that that the Coast Guard's traditional \nfunctions of maritime safety, search and rescue, aid to navigation, \netc., will not be hurt by the reorganization.\n  Port security operations accounted for 1-2 percent of Coast Guard \nactivities before 9/11. By early October 2001, they increased to 56 \npercent of all operations. The Coast Guard is trying to move towards a \n``new normalcy'' with port-security operations accounting for 20-25 \npercent of all operations. According to the Congressional Research \nService, prior to 9/11, the Coast Guard already was been underfunded \nwith regard to its expanding responsibilities. Over the last 25 years \nthere has been a substantial growth in mission areas such as counter-\ndrug operations, alien interception, pollution prevention, and \nfisheries enforcement. These functions will still need to be performed \nand have to be funded adequately.\n  Similarly, FEMA's non-DHS functions of natural disaster response and \nrelief should not be weakened.\n  Another issue we will have to grapple with is oversight. Some of the \noversight will rest with the Governmental Affairs Committee; some of it \nwill be spread among several committees. That may be a good thing; but \nit could also prove to be unworkable. Again, we will have to wait and \nsee. How we handle appropriations is another matter we will have to \nsort out.\n  Another issue is the labor rights of the DHS employees. When \nPresident Bush sent his DHS proposal to Congress, it contained anti-\nlabor provisions that would have allowed him to strip civil service \nprotections from Federal employees of the Department, so he could hire, \nfire and transfer employees as he wished.\n  On the Senate floor, Senator Lieberman offered an amendment to \nmaintain the current collective bargaining rights of more than 40,000 \nFederal employees slated to move into the new Department. At the same \ntime, in line with long-standing Presidential prerogative, the \nLieberman amendment would have given the administration the ability to \nsuspend these employees' collective bargaining rights if new job duties \nare related to intelligence, counterintelligence or terrorism \ninvestigations, and collective bargaining would adversely impact \nnational security.\n  President Bush threatened to veto the bill if the Lieberman amendment \npassed and Republicans filibustered the amendment. President Bush \ndemanded authority to strip all employees in the department of their \ncivil service protections. Citing national security concerns, the \nPresident claimed that the labor provisions would not give him broad \nenough authority to hire, fire and change job assignments at the \nproposed agency.\n  I think this course of action was regrettable. The Republicans did \nagree to a slight compromise on the labor issue: the department is \nrequired to consult on any workplace changes with employees' unions. In \nthe end, though, the President will have wider-ranging authority to \nwaive union rights than ever before. This is an issue we will have to \nrevisit.\n  We also need to be concerned about civil liberties. Of course, we \nneed to be vigilant to protect the American people from those who would \ndo us grave harm. But we can't sacrifice our freedom for security. \nGovernor Ridge and the new department will have to balance the two. It \nwon't be easy but it is absolutely necessary.\n  Speaking more parochially, because of New Jersey's proximity to New \nYork, we suffered enormously on 9/11: nearly 700 New Jerseyans lost \ntheir lives. But it is not just our proximity to New York that concerns \nme. We have plenty of critical infrastructure targets: ports, airports, \ntunnels, rail lines, chemical plants, etc. We have 8.5 million people \nand several large population centers. I want to make sure that we \naren't short-changed when the DHS allocates resources to the States to \nbolster their security.\n\n  I also want to make sure that Governor Ridge and the new department \nfulfill their responsibility to help keep guns out of the hands of \nterrorists. That means, to me, closing the ``gun show loophole''--\nsomething President Bush pledged to do as a candidate in 2000. It is to \neasy for people to buy guns and other weapons at gun shows, no \nquestions asked. We shouldn't make it easy for terrorists to buy \nassault weapons, .50-caliber guns, sniper rifles, etc.\n  In summary, the creation of the DHS has not been without controversy. \nAs I noted, there are questions about whether the consolidation of \nvarious agencies under one roof will be an effective way to prevent and \nrespond to terrorist attacks; whether the civil liberties of U.S. \ncitizens--particularly immigrants--will be adequately protected with \nregard to border security and intelligence gathering activities; \nwhether state and local entities will receive adequate funding for \ntheir new DHS-related responsibilities; and whether non-DHS functions \nof agencies will be protected.\n  Moving a bit farther a field, we need to consider where DHS fits in \nwith regard to our overall priorities for fighting terrorism. The new \ndepartment is responsible for preventing terrorism, but it will have \nnothing to do with addressing the root causes of that terrorism. Its \nvery existence and the debate that will swirl around it could take \nattention and resources away from more proactive foreign policy and \ndomestic law enforcement and social welfare efforts to reduce the \nimpetus for terrorist acts, foreign and domestic.\n  While the primary responsibility to make America safer without \nsacrificing our freedoms will rest with Governor Ridge and the new \nHomeland Security Department, in fact, all Americans share that somber \nresponsibility. We will all have to work together, and we wish Governor \nRidge well in this great undertaking.\n\n[[Page S1322]]\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I support the nomination of Tom Ridge \nto be Secretary of Homeland Security. I think that Mr. Ridge is an \nexcellent choice for the job.\n  If confirmed, Mr. Ridge will oversee the new Department of Homeland \nSecurity, the consolidation of more than two dozen agencies and offices \nthat have been reorganized into a single agency with an overriding \nmission: protecting the United States from terrorist attack and \nresponding to an attack should one occur.\n  Unlike his current position in the White House, Mr. Ridge will have \nbudget authority and will be accountable to Congress and the people.\n  I introduced legislation with Senator Bob Graham on September 21, \n2001, long before the Homeland Security Act was signed into law, to \ngive him such authority. I believe that it is indispensable for him to \ndo his job adequately.\n  I applaud Mr. Ridge's willingness to accept the responsibility of \nleading the new Department. He will oversee and direct the largest \nFederal reorganization since the National Security Act of 1947.\n  It is an enormous challenge. According to historians, James \nForrestal, the first Secretary of Defense after passage of the 1947 \nact, resigned after 2 years due to mental exhaustion caused by the \ndifficulties of managing the new Department.\n  Even with all of his energy and talent, Mr. Ridge will not be able to \ndo it alone.\n  We need to be sure that the Department of Homeland Security attracts \nand retains top people, people committed to ensuring homeland security. \nAnd we need to be sure that the department has the tools and resources \nit needs to protect us from and respond to terrorist attacks.\n  It is hard to understate the importance of getting this new \nDepartment off the ground and running.\n  Last November, I chaired a hearing of the Technology and Terrorism \nSubcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee on the Hart-Rudman \nTerrorism Task Force Report. Members of this new 17-member Hart-Rudman \nTask Force included two former Senators, two former Secretaries of \nState, two former chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and two Nobel \nlaureates.\n  The task force report is chilling to read. And its conclusion is even \nmore disturbing. It reads: ``A year after September 11, America remains \ndangerously unprepared to prevent and respond to a catastrophic \nterrorist attack on U.S. soil. In all likelihood, the next attack will \nresult in even greater casualties and widespread disruption to American \nlives and the economy.''\n  Just a month before our hearing, CIA Director George Tenet testified \nbefore the Joint Intelligence Committee inquiry that ``al-Qaeda is in \nan execution phase and intends to strike us both here and overseas.'' \nHe also said that the terrorist threat is as bad today as it was in the \nsummer of 2001.\n  The statements made by the Hart-Rudman Task Force as well as Director \nTenet contrast with Mr. Ridge's recent testimony before the Senate \nGovernment Affairs Committee.\n  There, Mr. Ridge testified that, ``America is undoubtedly safer and \nbetter prepared today than on September 10, 2001'' and that ``much has \nbeen accomplished'' to protect Americans from terrorism.\n  My own view is that, while the terrorist threat remains extremely \nserious, I would disagree with those who argue that we have done \nnothing since September 11 to reduce our vulnerability to a major \nterrorist attack.\n  In fact, since September 11, the 107th Congress has passed major \nanti-terrorism legislation in the areas of law enforcement, \nintelligence, aviation security, border security, and bioterrorism.\n  However, what we have done so far is not enough. Much more remains to \nbe done, particularly in the areas of intelligence, seaport security, \nand first responders, including the National Guard.\n  That is why many of us in Congress have been trying to pass \nadditional legislation to protect our country from terrorist attack.\n  Let me give three examples of homeland security legislation that I \nplan to pursue in this Congress.\n  First, we need to create the position of Director of National \nIntelligence, whose full-time job would be to oversee the Nation's \nintelligence community. Under the current structure, the intelligence \ncommunity is fragmented, there is a lack of coordination between \nagencies, and there is no effective leadership.\n  The concept behind the bill was endorsed by the House-Senate \nIntelligence Committee investigating the September 11 attacks.\n  Second, as the Hart-Rudman Task Force recognized, we need \ncomprehensive, immediate action to better secure our ports. Our \nseaports remain a huge gaping hole in our national security.\n  Terrorism experts who have studied the issue believe that if \nterrorists try to bring weapons of mass destruction into this country, \nthose weapons will almost certainly come in shipping containers. Only 1 \nto 2 percent of the 21,000 shipping containers that enter the nation's \n361 ports each day are even inspected.\n  I introduced legislation with Senators Kyl, Hutchison, and Snowe in \nthe last Congress that would thoroughly address the issue of port \nsecurity from the point cargo is loaded in a foreign country to its \narrival on land in the U.S. We plan to pursue similar legislation in \nthis Congress.\n  Third, we should train and equip 2,700 National Guard units for \nemergency response.\n  Modeled after legislation creating the successful National Guard \ncounterdrug program, my proposed bill would permit each governor, with \noversight and funding from the Secretary of Defense, to create a \nhomeland security activities plan for his or her State.\n  The National Governors Association, the National Guard , and the co-\nchairs of the Senate National Guard Caucus all support the bill. The \nHart-Rudman Task Force also endorsed the idea.\n  One thing we should do right now is fully fund homeland security. \nCertainly, the last thing we should be doing is starving the new \nDepartment of resources to fight the war on terrorism.\n  One reason I oppose the omnibus appropriations bill is that it cuts \nhomeland security by $1 billion, money that has already been requested, \nauthorized, and appropriated.\n  Right now, the INS will lose $627 million for border security. First \nresponders will lose $132 million. And other homeland security \ndepartments and agencies will also suffer.\n  These cuts will make our Nation more vulnerable. They will also make \nMr. Ridge's already tough job even harder.\n  I hope that he will be a vigorous advocate for legislation to \nstrengthen our country against terrorists and for adequate resources to \npay for such protection.\n  I congratulate Mr. Ridge on his nomination and look forward to \nworking with him once he is confirmed.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I associate myself with the comments made \nby the distinguished assistant Democratic leader. We asked our \ncolleagues to file amendments by the end of the day on Tuesday. They \nhave. There is a significant number of both Republican and Democratic \namendments. I am hopeful we can finish our work on this bill by \ntomorrow night. There is no reason, given the excellent debate we have \nhad on a number of issues, that we should not try to finish. I hope we \ncan get the cooperation of all Senators in seeking time agreements and \nin limiting the number of amendments yet to be offered. We have had a \nvery good debate. There will be many other occasions throughout the \nyear when we will have opportunities to express ourselves on a number \nof issues.\n  I urge my colleagues, on both sides of the aisle--as I say, there \nwere a good number of amendments offered by both Republican and \nDemocratic Senators--in order to accommodate that schedule.\n  I come to the floor to express my support for Tom Ridge as the first \nSecretary of Homeland Security. Governor Ridge has created an \nimpressive record in public service. As a Member of Congress, as \nGovernor from the State of Pennsylvania, he has done a good job in \nmeeting the challenges we all have faced as a country and we in \nparticular face at the Federal level of Government in addressing the \nneeds and concerns of our homeland--or as we sometimes say, hometown \ndefense--over the course of the last year.\n  There is one very consequential concern I have as we consider the \ncreation\n\n[[Page S1323]]\n\nof this Department and its leadership. That concern goes to resources. \nOn several occasions over the course of the last several years, and \neven the last several months, we as a body, we as a Senate, have come \nto the conclusion we cannot fight the war on terror, we cannot do what \nwe must do in creating a presence in the Persian Gulf, we cannot \naddress the extraordinary challenges we face in Afghanistan, if we do \nnot have the resources the Department of Defense needs to accommodate \nthose missions.\n  What did we do? We responded, as required, by providing the resources \nto the Department of Defense to ensure those missions could be \nfulfilled. I have every expectation we will be dealing with \nsupplementals in the not too distant future, and I would be surprised \nif it was not the case that the Defense Department, once again, comes \nto the Congress to seek approval for additional appropriations for this \nfiscal year. We will look at those requests, but in most cases my guess \nwould be we will support them. We will support them because we realize \nthey cannot carry out a mission without resources.\n  It is with that understanding that I am troubled this Department of \nHomeland Security has not had the same degree of support, does not have \nthe same degree of commitment, has not had the resources that it must \nhave to deal with the challenges and the mission that it faces and has \nfaced from its very creation. Last year, the Congress passed \noverwhelmingly by a vote of 92-7 a supplemental appropriations bill to \nprovide those resources. The President, for reasons that are not \nentirely clear to many of us, chose not to permit the $2.5 billion in \nthat supplemental appropriations bill for homeland defense.\n\n  Yet as I talk to Governors, as I talk to mayors, as I talk to local \nofficials at every level of Government, they tell me the single biggest \nconcern they have is their lack of confidence, their inability to deal \nwith what they perceive to be a real vulnerability in protecting water \nsupplies, energy facilities, roads, bridges, and ports. They are \nconcerned about that vulnerability. One mayor called it homeland \n``insecurity.'' He said there was a homeland insecurity today in part \nbecause in spite of what we all profess to be our goal, there is a lack \nof willingness, a lack of commitment time and again on the part of the \nadministration to provide the resources to meet that goal in dealing \nwith the needs of the Defense Department and others as we consider our \nmission internationally.\n  The President's budget we are now debating, this omnibus \nappropriations bill, unfortunately, reflects the same lack of attention \nand priority and concern for resources. In fact, cuts have been made \nthat devastate our ability to deal with homeland defense, devastate our \nability to deal with those areas for which there is absolute unanimity \nabout priority. The budget that is currently pending would cut 1,175 \nFBI agents, 1,600 Customs inspectors, and 450 food safety inspectors. \nThe list goes on and on.\n  You cannot have security without resources. You cannot deal with our \nextraordinary challenges in law enforcement without FBI agents. We \ncannot deal with the problems we have with immigration without Custom \ninspectors. We certainly cannot deal with the insecurity our country \nfaces today without dealing with food safety in a more consequential \nway.\n  We have a responsibility to ensure as this Department of Homeland \nSecurity becomes a reality, as we create the leadership, as we now \nconfirm the first Secretary, we owe it to him, but far more importantly \nwe owe it to the country to ensure that homeland insecurity is \naddressed, insecurity with regard to resources, insecurity with regard \nto our budget, insecurity in dealing with the extraordinary challenges \nwe face in restoring confidence and building the kind of true homeland \nsecurity we all want and need.\n  We will have more opportunities to talk about this matter as \nSecretary Ridge comes before the Congress. We are off to an important \nbeginning as he is confirmed today. I hope he will come back with a \ncomprehensive plan that will enable him to convince not only us but the \nAmerican people that he will have the resources and this will be the \npriority we all say it is.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, there has been a lot of discussion about \nthe funding for homeland security. I agree with my colleagues that this \nis an area that is going to require more resources. In particular, we \nwant to make sure that the resources flow down to the State and local \nlevels, that they are available to the first responders, those who are \nfirst on the scene in the event of a terrorist attack.\n  I do want to point out, however, that H.J. Res. 2 contains \nsignificant new funding to strengthen our homeland security. For \nexample, the omnibus bill provides over $5.3 billion for the \nTransportation Security Administration, which is a critical component \nin our efforts to secure our national transportation system and to \nensure the freedom of movement of American people and commerce.\n  This funding amounts to a $1.84 billion increase over last year, or a \n53-percent increase over fiscal 2002 figures. Of this funding, a \nminimum of $124 million will go toward buying explosive detection \nsystems and trace detection systems; $250 million in funding will go \ntoward the installation of airport detection systems. Many of us have \nnoted the increased scrutiny of checked baggage in the recent weeks. \nOne hundred million is for a very important purpose and that is for \nseaport security grants to port authorities.\n  In another area, let's look at the first responders, which are of \nspecial concern to me. The omnibus bill includes more than $1.6 billion \nfor emergency planning and assistance to help prepare our first \nresponders. This amounts to an increase of over $997 million from the \nlevel provided in the fiscal year 2002 budget. Of this money, $900 \nmillion is for the FIRE Grant Program, a very popular program in the \nState of Maine, that helps our firefighters equip themselves and \nprepare for future threats. In Maine, we found that the FIRE Grant \nProgram is particularly useful to some of our small, rural communities, \nwhich simply would not have access to the resources needed to upgrade \ntheir equipment and their training.\n  Mr. President, $114 million of the money for FIRE Grant Program \nfunding is for interoperable communications equipment for firefighters \nand EMS personnel. September 11 taught us very dearly how important it \nis for our first responders to be able to communicate with one another, \nto have compatible equipment.\n  Mr. President, $75 million is for urban search and rescue teams and \nanother $75 million is for State and local emergency planning grants. \nWe need to do so much more training and joint exercises at all levels \nof government to make sure we have a coordinated response to allow us \nto detect, prepare for, and, if necessary, respond to a terrorist \nattack more effectively.\n  Let's look at the area of bioterrorism, one of the major threats we \nface today. We learned right here in the Senate the amount of damage \nthat an anthrax attack can inflict. The omnibus bill provides \nconsiderable funding for bioterrorism. It includes money for the CDC, \nfor example, for a smallpox vaccine, for an evaluation and research on \nthe anthrax vaccine, and it includes money to make our hospitals better \nable to respond to a bioterrorism attack.\n  I point out that the $3.7 billion for bioterrorism preparedness is \nexactly the same in this omnibus bill as in the Labor-HHS-Education \nbill authored under different leadership last July. The bioterrorism \npreparedness funding includes $940 million for upgrading State and \nlocal capacity. It includes $300 million for the National \nPharmaceutical Stockpile. It includes $492 million for hospital \npreparedness. It includes $1.5 billion for bioterrorism-related \nresearch and construction at the National Institutes of Health.\n\n  My point is that there is significant and much needed new funding \nincluded in this legislation. So we are making a genuine effort to \nprovide the resources that are necessary to make our Nation more \nsecure. It is not going to happen overnight. Money alone does not solve\n\n[[Page S1324]]\n\nthe problem, but money, clearly, is part of the solution, and we are \nmaking a major step forward in that regard through the funding provided \nby this bill, the billions of dollars in funding provided by this bill.\n  Finally, let me touch on the Coast Guard, which is of special concern \nto me. The omnibus appropriations bill includes more than $6 billion \nfor the Coast Guard. This amounts to an increase of more than $1 \nbillion from last year's enacted level. I stress this because it has \nbeen of great concern to me, Senator Stevens, and many other of my \ncolleagues that we fully fund the Coast Guard so it does not jeopardize \nits traditional mission while it takes on increased responsibilities in \nthe area of homeland security, particularly port security.\n  So I think it should be evident from a review of this bill that we \nare making a significant commitment of additional funding for homeland \nsecurity. This is a very positive step forward. More resources \nundoubtedly will be needed and will be considered as part of the \nPresident's budget.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I yield to the distinguished Senator from \nUtah, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, for up to 6 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank the Chair. I thank the Senator from Maine. I sure \nappreciate the work that she has done on this issue. She deserves a lot \nof credit. This has been a big week for her with all of the things she \nhas been able to accomplish.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to rise in support of the confirmation of \nmy colleague and friend, Tom Ridge, to serve as this Nation's first \nSecretary of Homeland Security.\n  I commend my fellow Senators for moving this nomination with the \nspeed that it deserves. Senators Collins and Lieberman have done an \nexcellent job. I am very appreciative of that.\n  With the creation of the Department of Homeland Security, and now the \nconfirmation of Tom Ridge to head that agency, the President finally \nhas a unified department specifically devoted to fighting terrorism.\n  Tom Ridge will begin his tenure as Secretary with an enormous task: \nimplementing the new Department that Congress has created just months \nago.\n  This is the most comprehensive reorganization that our Federal \nGovernment has undergone in over 50 years.\n  Because I know Tom Ridge, I know that he is up to the task. I view \nhis confirmation as critical to the success of the new Department's \nmission.\n  After successfully implementing the reorganization of nearly 200,000 \nFederal employees, Secretary Ridge's work will just have begun.\n  As the first Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, Tom \nRidge will face the awesome challenges and responsibilities of \nsafeguarding our borders and enhancing our Nation's ability to respond \nto future terrorist attacks. He must do so while ensuring that our \ncherished individual civil liberties are protected.\n  He will be responsible for collecting intelligence from a number of \ndifferent sources, fusing it into a single coherent picture, and then \nensuring that it is acted upon appropriately.\n  While all of us hope and pray that our Nation will not be attacked by \nterrorists again, we must remain ever vigilant to that real threat. The \ndepartment's goals and efforts are of paramount importance to all our \nconstituents, including those in my home state of Utah and, of course, \nthe entire Nation.\n  Tom Ridge is the right man for this challenge. He was a wonderful \nGovernor of Pennsylvania. He certainly has been a heroic figure \nthroughout the lives of many people.\n  Less than 1 month after the terrorist attacks on our country, \nGovernor Ridge was sworn in as the Director of the White House Office \nof Homeland Security.\n  He has worked there with an unwavering dedication to protect our \nhomeland. I commend Governor Ridge on his efforts to improve our \nNation's security and his dedication and courage in tackling these most \ndifficult issues in these times of crisis.\n  Tom has accomplished much.\n  While there is much more to do to ensure the safety of our great \nNation, I am comforted by his demonstrated track record of leadership \nand success.\n  Tom Ridge and the President have been a steady beacon of hope for all \nAmericans, and I want to thank them for all their accomplishments.\n  By confirming Tom Ridge, we are taking a big step forward in helping \nto defend our Nation from terrorism.\n  I am confident that Secretary Ridge will work vigorously to secure \nour Nation and protect Americans--and to protect all of us in ways that \nreally have to be undertaken.\n  I am proud to support Secretary Ridge's nomination and look forward \nto working with him on homeland defense and security issues in the \nfuture.\n  I look forward to working with my colleague from Maine and others on \nthe other side in the future on these very important issues.\n  This agency is so big that it crosses over a whole raft of \ncommunities.\n  I again want to pay tribute to the distinguished chairman of the \ncommittee and her ranking member for having done such a good job in \nbringing this nomination forward at this particular time.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time for the chairman. I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the Senate is now about to vote on the \nnomination of Gov. Tom Ridge to be the new Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity. I urge all of my colleagues to vote yes on this nomination. \nHe is truly an outstanding individual to head this important new \nDepartment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Thomas J. Ridge of Pennsylvania to be Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity?\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

Who yields time on the motion to waive?\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, before recognizing my colleague, Senator \nDurbin, let me say the Reed-Durbin amendment would provide up to 1 \nmillion Americans who are long-term unemployed and were not assisted by \nthe January 8 amendment we passed. This would be a positive stimulus \nfor our economy. These benefits would be paid out until the economy \ncame back and then automatically stop. It also recognizes the \nstructural changes. The high-tech meltdown and the exodus of \nmanufacturing have left many people without jobs. They need our help \nnow.\n  Our economy is in distress. We have to help these hard-working \nAmericans. We cannot wait any longer because as we wait, they invade \ntheir 401(k)s, they extend their credit cards, they do anything to make \nends meet. We should help them now.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Rhode Island for yielding. I am \nhappy to cosponsor this amendment with him. I am glad it has finally \ncome to a vote.\n  I listened to the arguments yesterday by the Senators from Oklahoma \nand Iowa and others who suggested this recession is not that bad; we \nreally should not be talking about a million people who have exhausted \ntheir unemployment benefits; things were a lot worse 12 or 13 years \nago.\n  The unemployment rate in the United States of America has increased \nover 50 percent since October of 2000. We now have 6.0 percent or more \nwho are unemployed in this country, a million of whom have exhausted \ntheir unemployment benefits. When the President said he was going to \nhelp these families, he forgot a million Americans, 53,000 in my State.\n  I hope my colleagues in the Senate will understand that the money we \nhave collected over the years and we put in the unemployment trust fund \nis money designed specifically for this purpose.\n  Previous Presidents, Democrats and Republicans alike, have noted the \nneed to help these struggling families. We cannot turn our backs on \nthem. We will have a chance today by voting yes on this amendment, and \nI hope my colleagues on both sides will join in that effort.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, how much time is remaining on both \nsides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma has 2\\1/2\\ minutes. \nThe Senator from Rhode Island has 36 seconds.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I urge my colleagues to vote no on the \nmotion to waive the budget point of order. I am afraid we are going to \nhave to decide this many times, are we going to be waiving the budget \nevery time we turn around?\n  There is a reason a budget point of order lies against this \namendment. We are on an appropriations bill. Instead of trying to pass \nappropriations, some people are saying, let's expand entitlements.\n  It so happens we did this January 7. The Senate unanimously passed a \nbill to expand unemployment compensation, extend the present law \nthrough May, and it cost us about $7.2 billion.\n  Now our colleagues are coming back and saying: This is a 13-week \nFederal program. Let's make it a 26-week Federal program, except let's \neven do more. The Federal program today is up to 13 weeks. The bill we \nhave before us says all States get a mandatory 26 weeks. It is not \ncoupled to what the State programs have.\n  We have never done that in the history of the United States. We have \nalways coupled Federal unemployment extensions with the State program. \nBut that is not what this amendment does. The amendment was not drafted \nwell and was not thought out well. It is very expensive. It is about \nthe fifth iteration we have seen, and it is still not done very well.\n  I urge my colleagues, if they want to do it, introduce the bill, have \nit referred to the appropriate committee, have that committee have \nhearings on it and mark it up with professional staff to do a good job. \nThis is grossly irresponsible. It would cost $6.3 billion.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a Congressional \nBudget Office letter stating that fact.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 22, 2003.\n     Hon. Don Nickles,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Budget, U.S. Senate, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: As requested by your staff, CBO has \n     prepared a preliminary estimate of the costs of amendment \n     number 40 to House Joint Resolution 2. This amendment would \n     expand the Temporary Extended Unemployment Compensation Act \n     of 2002 (as amended by Public Law 108-1) to provide \n     additional weeks of federal unemployment benefits by \n     increasing the maximum number of additional weeks of benefits \n     available in all states from 13 to 26. The amendment also \n     would change the number of weeks available in states with \n     high unemployment from 13 to 7.\n       CBO estimates that enactment of this amendment would \n     increase outlays by between $5.8 billion and $5.9 billion in \n     2003, and by about $500 million in 2004, for a total cost of \n     about $6.3 billion. Under our most current estimates, there \n     would be no significant budgetary effects in subsequent \n     years. Under the March 2002 baseline assumptions, there would \n     be an offsetting increase in revenues in later years because \n     this spending would reduce the amount of Reed Act transfers \n     assumed under the March projections. However, CBO has not yet \n     estimated this effect.\n       If you have additional questions about this estimate, we \n     will be pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is \n     Christi Hawley Sadoti, who may be reached at 226-2820.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Barry B. Anderson,\n                                                  Acting Director.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Colleagues, let's have regular order in the Senate. Why \nhave the Finance Committee have jurisdiction over an issue if we are \njust going to skip the committee and consider it on the floor? Are we \ngoing to do this with every authorizing committee: There is an \nappropriations bill, let's ignore the authorizing committee and come up \nwith all kinds of entitlement expansions. That is the reason a budget \npoint of order lies against this. That budget point of order is well \ntaken.\n  This chairman of the Budget Committee plans on enforcing the budget. \nI urge my colleagues to vote no on the motion to waive the Budget Act.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Since President Bush assumed office in January 2001, the \neconomic well-being of America's families has significantly \ndeteriorated, and a major cause of this crisis for so many families is \nthe economic policy of the Bush administration, which has neglected the \nbasic needs of working men and women, lavished extravagant tax breaks \non the wealthiest taxpayers, and allowed corporate abuse and excess to \ngo unchecked.\n  Today, nearly 8.6 million Americans are unemployed--2.6 million more \nthan when President Bush took office. Due to the lack of available \njobs, the number of long-term unemployed--those out of work for more \nthan 6 months, has now soared to nearly 2 million--a 70 percent \nincrease from last year. Long-term unemployment has increased in every \nmonth since March 2001. It is clear that Congress needs to do more for \nthese Americans, who have worked hard, played by the rules, and are \nsuffering because of the economic downturn.\n  The new law enacted earlier this month provided needed assistance for \nmany of the unemployed, but it does nothing for the 1 million long-term \nunemployed who have run out of their State and Federal unemployment \nbenefits and still have not found jobs. These Americans are struggling \nto make ends meet. Many have depleted their savings\n\n[[Page S1326]]\n\nand refinanced their homes. A tragic number are facing foreclosure.\n  In Massachusetts, nearly 170,000 workers are unemployed. Ninety \nthousand of those workers will be helped by the new law. But more than \n30,000 of those hardest hit by the recession have run out of all of \ntheir State and Federal benefits and are still out of work.\n  The unemployment trust fund now contains about $25 billion. It was \nintended for just this kind of situation. We now have an opportunity to \nextend unemployment compensation to families across this country who \nhave lost their jobs through no fault of their own, but have not yet \nfound a new job. They deserve this lifeline during this difficult time, \nbefore they are able to get back on their feet.\n  The issue is fundamental fairness.\n  At other times in recent years, Republicans and Democrats have come \ntogether to provide this urgently needed support. The first President \nBush signed into law three benefit extensions for those who had run out \nof their State and Federal benefits. The same is true of the recessions \nof the 1970s and 1980s. Congress recognized each time that benefits \nwere insufficient to reach the workers who were hardest hit. We acted \nto give them a safety net. It's time to live up to this standard now \nand provide unemployment benefits for these 1 million workers. These \nbenefits are their lifeline, and Congress should act as soon as \npossible to provide the assistance they deserve.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment by \nmy colleague from Rhode Island. While I understand his desire to \naddress the problem of unemployment, I would suggest this is neither \nthe time nor the place to do so.\n  First, I would remind my colleagues that this amendment would \nincrease mandatory spending in an appropriation bill, and therefore is \nsubject to a 60-vote point of order.\n  Second, let's remember what we've already done to address this issue. \nLast year, Congress voted to provide more than $11 billion in federally \nfunded benefits, and we voted earlier this month to provide an \nadditional $7 billion on top of that. That's a total of $18 billion in \nfederally funded unemployment benefits.\n  Third, I would suggest this amendment is based on a faulty premise. \nOn one hand, my colleague seems to suggest unemployment is worse than \never before. On the other hand, he suggests this amendment is no more \nthan we've done before.\n  I would suggest he is mistaken on both counts.\n  The truth is this amendment represents the greatest expansion of \nFederal unemployment benefits in history, and it is being proposed at a \ntime when unemployment is well below historical recession levels.\n  Let's be clear about what this amendment does. It would provide a \nminimum of 26 weeks of federally funded unemployment benefits and a \nmaximum of 33 weeks--at an additional cost of more than $6 billion.\n  The last--and only time--Congress provided up to 33 weeks of \nunemployment benefits was back in 1992 when the unemployment rate \nreached nearly 8 percent. Today, the unemployment rate is 6 percent.\n  Moreover, every other time Congress has provided federally funded \nunemployment benefits, they have been linked to the duration of State \nbenefits. This amendment would provide between 26 and 33 weeks of \nFederal benefits without regard to the duration of State benefits. This \nis an unprecedented expansion of the unemployment program.\n  It violates the insurance principles inherent in the unemployment \nprogram by breaking the link between the time someone has worked to the \ntime that person can collect unemployment benefits. This amendment \nwould allow someone who worked as few as 20 weeks to collect as much as \n33 weeks of federally funded benefits. This is neither the right time, \nthe right place, nor the right way to change the unemployment program.\n  Unemployment has not risen to the historical level of previous \nrecessions. Moreover, a uniform duration of benefits would violate \nevery historical precedent.\n  I urge my colleagues to sustain the point of order and defeat this \namendment.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, right now the American people are dealing \nwith tough economic times. Over 1 million Americans have exhausted \ntheir unemployment benefits without finding a job, more than 30,000 of \nthose people are from my home State of Massachusetts. Can you imagine \nhow hopeless these workers are to be at the end of their benefits with \nno job? I've heard from so many of my constituents recently about the \ngreat difficulties they're having finding jobs and how scared they are \nabout providing for their families when their benefits run out. These \nare people who are desperate to work, but they've found that jobs are \nsimply not available right now. In fact, there are 1.5 million fewer \njobs today than in March 2001 when the current economic downturn began, \nand the number of jobs in the economy has been stagnant for several \nmonths.\n  I am pleased that Senator Reed has offered an amendment to the \nomnibus appropriations bill to provide additional weeks of benefits to \nthe long-term unemployed, to those 1 million American workers whose \nbenefits have already expired. I am a cosponsor of Senator Reed's \namendment, although unfortunately I will not be present to vote in \nsupport of the motion to waive the budget act today. When we passed S. \n23 on the first day of the 108th Congress, we extended benefits for one \ngroup of the unemployed, but ignored this equally deserving group. It \nis totally unfair to me that we have not provided benefits to the long-\nterm unemployed, particularly when we know that the current \nunemployment rate of 6.0 percent is the highest rate in nearly 9 years \nand is higher than when the Temporary Emergency Unemployment \nCompensation program was created.\n  Twenty percent of America's unemployed have been without work for \nmore than twenty-six weeks and that percentage is still growing. We \nmust not leave the long-term unemployed and their families with no \nwhere to turn. I urge my colleagues to support the Reed amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. I yield 10 seconds to the Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, I point out that taxes have been paid \ninto the unemployment insurance trust fund for the purpose of paying \nunemployment insurance in an economic downturn. That fund has close to \n$25 billion in it. About $7 billion was used in the last legislation we \npassed. The purpose of paying that money in good times is to be able to \npay it out in bad times. I support this amendment.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, we might be able to wait here for \nprocedural niceties, but the million Americans who are desperate for \njobs and can't find jobs cannot wait. I urge passage.\n  I request the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs. \nFeinstein), the Senator from Iowa (Mr. Harkin), the Senator from South \nCarolina (Mr. Hollings), the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouye), the \nSenator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry) and the Senator from Connecticut \n(Mr. Lieberman) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would vote ``Aye''.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

CROP DISASTER ASSISTANCE.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of Agriculture (referred to \n     in this title as the ``Secretary'') shall use such sums as \n     are necessary of funds of the Commodity Credit Corporation to \n     make emergency financial assistance authorized under this \n     section available to producers on a farm that have incurred \n     qualifying crop losses for the 2001 or 2002 crop, or both, \n     due to damaging weather or related condition, as determined \n     by the Secretary.\n       (b) Administration.--The Secretary shall make assistance \n     available under this section in the same manner as provided \n     under section 815 of the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food \n     and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations \n     Act, 2001 (Public Law 106-387; 114 Stat. 1549, 1549A-55), \n     including using the same loss thresholds for the quantity and \n     quality losses as were used in administering that section.\n       (c) Crop Insurance.--In carrying out this section, the \n     Secretary shall not discriminate against or penalize \n     producers on a farm that have purchased crop insurance under \n     the Federal Crop Insurance Act (7 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.).\n\n     SEC. 203.

The Senator from Mississippi.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 204\n\n             (Purpose: To provide agricultural assistance)\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I call up Cochran amendment No. 204.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Cochran] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 204.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of January 21, 2003, under \n``Text of Amendments.'')\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, just for the information of all \nSenators, the order that has been agreed to will accommodate debate on \nboth the Cochran amendment and the Democratic amendment simultaneously. \nThere will be 70 minutes equally divided to accommodate Senators who \nwish to speak to the amendments. I am sure we will accommodate Senators \non both sides of the aisle in an attempt to alternate back and forth as \npeople wish to speak. So both amendments are pending and both \namendments are subject to comment by our colleagues.\n  I appreciate, as always, the great willingness on the part of the \nchairman of the Agriculture Committee to enter into this agreement and \nto accommodate this debate as we anticipate it.\n  It has been 342 days since the effort was first initiated to bring \nabout meaningful disaster relief to many parts of the country. During \nthose 342 days, I don't know how many hours we spent on the Senate \nfloor attempting to inform our colleagues and urging the Senate to act \nas expeditiously as it could to address the concerns of so many farmers \nand ranchers.\n  We did it first in the farm bill itself. We attempted to provide \nmeaningful disaster assistance within the farm legislation. It passed \nin the Senate. In conference, I had a number of conversations with the \nchair of the Agriculture Committee in the House and with the Speaker, \nand it was the view, almost unanimously expressed in the House, that \nthey would not be willing to support disaster assistance on the farm \nbill. They said: We will come back at a later date and address it in a \nsufficient way. So we completed our work on the farm bill and \nanticipated we would have an opportunity to pass meaningful assistance \nlater in the year.\n  When the Interior appropriations bill came before the Senate, we \noffered an amendment, and it generated 79 votes. That amendment \nprovided about $6 billion in direct assistance to farmers and ranchers. \nForty different farm organizations publicly expressed their support for \nthe effort. Over and over again, people said: This must be urgent. You \nhave to understand the extraordinary\n\n[[Page S1328]]\n\nurgency of what is happening and the need for this relief as quickly as \nyou can get it to us.\n  Madam President, just for the record, I note that I will use my \nleader time to make my remarks with regard to the amendment so that I \ncan accommodate other Senators who wish to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The leader has that privilege.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. So we adopted that amendment with 79 votes, with every \nexpectation that we could get help to the farmers and ranchers who need \nit as quickly and as meaningfully as possible.\n\n  Almost from the beginning, the administration's position was that we \njust could not afford it; that the $6 billion was out of line; that it \nwas too expensive; that there really was not a way to provide the \nresources to help farmers and ranchers with the magnitude of help we \nproposed in the amendment.\n  I must say, I find it deeply troubling that at the very time the \nadministration says we cannot afford the $6 billion in disaster \nassistance, they come forth with a $670 billion tax cut, a tax cut that \nhelps those at the very top, with very little support for anyone else--\nborrowing the money, I might add.\n  So, on one hand, the administration is saying to the American people, \nsomehow we can afford a tax cut, $20 billion of which will go to 226 \nmillionaires, at the very time we do not have the resources, we do not \nhave the will, we do not have the support for $6 billion for farmers \nand ranchers.\n  I have to say, over the course of the last 342 days, time and time \nand time again, people have come to us saying: We don't understand \neither, but we hope that however you ultimately decide to help us, you \nhelp us soon.\n  There are places in South Dakota that have not had rain for months. \nThere are places in South Dakota where we had no crop at all last year. \nWe have locations in our State where virtually all of the livestock \npopulation has been sold off.\n  In letters, in e-mails, in phone calls, farmers and ranchers--by the \nthousands--have contacted the Senate pleading for help, asking that we \ndo so as quickly as possible. So this is our last chance. This is our \nlast opportunity, at least for the foreseeable future. I cannot imagine \nwhen we can come back to the Senate floor and try this again.\n  So we are offering the same amendment that generated 79 votes last \nfall. The amendment provides help in the two categories where help is \nmost needed--the crop disaster assistance program and the livestock \nassistance program--with one minor exception. Last fall, the \nadministration shifted several hundred million dollars to ill-\nconsidered, unresponsive, and underfunded disaster efforts for those \nkey or niche areas of livestock producers, a very small number of \nlivestock producers, which amounted to about 2 weeks of assistance \nbefore it expired.\n  This amendment replenishes what the administration took from that \nimportant account, funding for school lunch and funding for hunger \nrelief. I must say, I hope everyone will recognize the importance of \ntaking this action.\n  As I said, the Senate is already on record; 79 Senators in an \noverwhelming bipartisan vote, 40 organizations, including the Farmers \nUnion, the Farm Bureau, the National Wheat Growers, the National Cattle \nand Beef Association, the National American Soybean Association, 40 \nfarm organizations have said: Help us now. Do what you were not able to \ndo last year. Join as you did last year. Pass this meaningful \nassistance. We have waited too long.\n  I hope people recognize there is a difference between the two \namendments. I have the utmost respect for the Senator from Mississippi, \nthe chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee. He will do an \noutstanding job as chair of the committee itself. We don't stipulate a \ndollar figure in this amendment. We leave that to the administration to \ndefine. We simply say: Let's meet the need that is there, meet the need \nin crop assistance, meet the need in livestock assistance, but meet the \nneed that is there.\n  The alternative says: We know the need is there, but we are only \ngoing to provide $3 billion to meet that need. We recognize it may only \nbe half but, I suppose they would argue, at least it is something.\n  We need more than just something. We need to provide the kind of \nassistance that is so desperately needed in the dead of winter to \nensure that at long last, those who have waited so long get the help \nthey truly deserve.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, let me compliment the distinguished \nDemocratic leader for his effort to get an agreement under which we \ncould carefully and thoughtfully consider this issue in the Senate. We \nhave reached that agreement, and we have two alternatives now pending \nbefore the Senate: The so-called Daschle amendment and the Cochran \namendment.\n  For the information of Senators, these are not the only efforts that \nhave been made up to this point to deal with the disaster facing \nagriculture. In fairness, we have to acknowledge that the \nadministration has been working very diligently to use existing \nauthority to make payments to producers under the authority of current \nlaw to deal with the losses being suffered in production agriculture \nand in the livestock industry. Specifically, the Risk Management Agency \nof the Department of Agriculture has been supervising the payment of \ncrop insurance benefits and so far $4.1 billion in crop insurance \nindemnities have been paid to producers across the country.\n  In addition, the Livestock Compensation Program has been utilized to \nthe extent of the payment of $932 million by the Department of \nAgriculture, and for the Livestock Feed Assistance Program, outlays of \n$150 million have been made available. Adding up these three specific \ninstances of assistance, we can see that $5.182 billion of benefits \nhave been paid to agricultural producers.\n  I agree with what the distinguished Senator from South Dakota has \nsaid: That is not enough. So we come here today trying to define new \nauthorities for the Department of Agriculture under which additional \nbenefits can be made available to compensate farmers for losses that \nhave been sustained because of not only drought, which has been \ndevastating in some parts of the country, but also other adverse \nweather conditions--excessive rainfall at the time in the South where \nfarmers were trying to get into the fields to harvest cotton, to \nharvest other crops, and were not able to do so because of the \ndifficult conditions created by excessive rainfall.\n\n  All of these producers will be eligible for benefits under the \nCochran amendment. It will be capped however. The CBO, the \nCongressional Budget Office, estimates the outlays under this amendment \nwould amount to $3.1 billion. The additional fact to be kept in mind \nis, under our scoring procedures, trying not to add to the deficit with \nthis amendment, we have offset the spending under the Appropriations \nCommittee bill to which this amendment is added, so that this is not \ngoing to be new spending under this amendment.\n  By comparison with the Daschle amendment, the $6.5 billion that the \nCongressional Budget Office estimates that amendment will cost will be \nadded to the deficit. It is not offset. It is declared an emergency. \nAnd under the Budget Act, that is one way of funding disasters that are \nunanticipated. I am not suggesting it is illegal, but it simply does \nhave budget implications in terms of additions to the deficit that the \nCochran amendment does not.\n  We also try to deal with the disaster in terms of defining the areas \nwhere benefits could be made available. These basically are in disaster \ncounties, counties that have been declared a disaster under current law \nby the Department of Agriculture or by the President. Other farmers who \nare located outside of those designated areas, if they can prove a loss \nup to 35 percent, may do that, and they will be eligible for \ncompensation just as farmers who are located in the disaster \ndeclaration areas.\n  We are trying to make this applicable to those who have suffered \ndisasters. At one point some Senators raised a question about the \nwording of this amendment I offer today because it appeared to make \navailable benefits to\n\n[[Page S1329]]\n\nthose who might not have had a disaster or may not have suffered any \neconomic losses due to any kind of disaster. We hope we have tightened \nup the definition of eligibility so only those where there have been \ndeclarations of disaster or where they can prove they suffered damages \nup to 35 percent will be eligible for benefits. We hope we have taken \ncare of that difficulty. We appreciate the fact that Senators are not \nbashful normally and they were not in this case either when they \ndisagreed with some parts of this amendment as it was earlier drafted \nand brought this to our attention.\n  We tried to accommodate those concerns, and we think the amendment \nhas been improved to the extent that it merits the support of the \nSenate.\n  We hope Senators on both sides of the aisle will look at the \nsuggestions we have made carefully. We have tried to cover livestock \nproducers as well as row crop producers. Other specialty vegetable \ncrops and the like are covered as well. We think this is a generous but \nresponsible way to deal with the problem. We hope Senators will vote \nfor the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, there are a number of our colleagues \nwho have asked to be recognized. I don't want to take a lot of time \nbecause we have a lot of Senators who wish to be heard.\n  There is one difference between the two amendments of which I think \nall of our colleagues ought to be aware. Under the Cochran amendment, \nin disaster counties, counties declared disaster, every producer is \neligible regardless of loss. In my State, there are counties that were \ndeclared disaster that had pockets where they had all the rain they \nneeded, where there are livestock producers who really don't need any \nassistance.\n  What we are doing is taking away from those who need assistance to \nprovide resources to those who don't need it by not differentiating, by \nnot having some qualification, by not saying they have to meet this \nthreshold.\n  What our amendment says is, they have to have incurred at least a 35-\npercent loss to be eligible for benefits, even in those counties \ndeclared disaster. There is no discretion in that regard in the Cochran \namendment.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL. Madam President, I rise in support of the amendment being \noffered by Senator Daschle to provide much-needed assistance to our \nNation's farmers who have been hard hit by a series of natural \ndisasters, notably severe drought that has destroyed crops and harmed \nlivestock operations in many States. Although my State of Wisconsin has \nnot suffered the losses that most other farm States have faced these \nlast 2 years, wise, Wisconsin farmers have been hurt by natural \ndisasters in the past and probably will be again in the future. And \nuntil we come up with an agriculture policy that protects farmers from \nruin when drought, or floods, or tornadoes, or disease strikes, \nWisconsin will stand by other farm States as they seek disaster \nassistance.\n  Before I yield the floor to other Senators who would like to speak on \nthis amendment, I would like to take a moment to briefly comment on the \nfiscal year 2003 appropriations bill for Agriculture, Rural Development \nand Related Agencies. First I commend Senator Cochran on the job he has \ndone, given the tough fiscal restraints he was facing. It is never easy \nto cut funding and balance multiple priorities, and I believe Senator \nCochran has done good work, given the circumstances.\n  However, there are two items that have been taken out of the bill as \nit was originally written, which I believe warrant mention, and \nreconsideration.\n  The bill before us no longer funds an expansion of the Summer Food \nService Program. This increase would have expanded to all 50 States a \nsuccessful 13 State pilot program to streamline the process of setting \nup a summer feeding site. A report released this summer found that the \n13 pilot States increased their participation in the SFSP by 8.9 \npercent between July 2000 and July 2001. Participation in the rest of \nthe Nation decreased by approximately 3.3 percent during the same time \nperiod. I have an amendment to restore the funding for this important \nprogram.\n  I also have an amendment to fund a program authorized in the 2002 \nFarm Bill and funded in the Agriculture Appropriations bill passed out \nof committee last July. The program, initiated by the Girl Scouts of \nthe USA, Boy Scouts of America, National FFA Organization, and National \n4-H Council, allows these experienced and very successful youth \norganizations to increase their presence in remote rural communities. \nAs we pare back on funds for education and other federal initiatives \nfor our children, we should not also cripple private efforts to bring \nprograms like Girl Scouts, Boy Scouts, 4-H and Future Farmers of \nAmerica to our underserved rural youth.\n  Again, I thank Senator Cochran and his staff for their hard work. \nOverall, I believe this is a good bill, and I look forward to working \ntogether to try and restore the items I just mentioned in a fiscally \nresponsible manner.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Nebraska, Mr. Hagel.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. HAGEL. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, I rise in support of drought disaster aid for \nAmerica's drought-stricken agricultural producers and to support the \nCochran amendment to the omnibus appropriations bill.\n  I wish to also express my thanks to Chairman Stevens, Chairman \nCochran, and their staffs for their hard work and especially for \nfinding the necessary critical funding to offset the spending in the \nbill.\n  Those of us in drought-stricken States have known for many months \nthat our farmers and ranchers needed assistance. Unfortunately, in a \nyear when 80 percent of U.S. counties were declared a disaster, the \nHouse and Senate adjourned last November with neither Chamber having \npassed 2002 drought aid.\n  There is no doubt that disaster relief is justified. In Nebraska, \nonly the Dust Bowl years of 1934 and 1936 were dryer than what the \nState experienced last summer. Since autumn, conditions have only \nworsened throughout much of the Plains, as well as most of the West and \nSouthwest. This has been one of the driest winters in these regions in \nmore than 100 years.\n  Nebraska officials are becoming increasingly concerned about \nirrigation resources for the upcoming growing season. The water level \nat Lake McConaughy, Nebraska's largest reservoir, is 60 percent below \ncapacity.\n  With the Federal budget deficit projected to balloon near $300 \nbillion in this fiscal year, Congress must demonstrate fiscal \nresponsibility. The days of budget surpluses are gone, but at the same \ntime we must turn our attention to this much-needed drought assistance.\n  Under this proposal, the Cochran amendment, disaster payments would \nget more attention more quickly than under the old crop disaster \nformula, and we would help a larger number of farmers and ranchers.\n  Months ago, the President made it clear that any disaster aid for \nagriculture must be offset. Last week, White House agriculture adviser \nChuck Conner reiterated this requirement, telling farm groups that all \ndisaster aid proposals would be judged upon three criteria: One, cost; \ntwo, available budget offsets; and, three, whether farmers would be \nmore self-reliant in the end. The Cochran amendment complies with the \nPresident's request.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the proposal of the chairman of the \nAgriculture Committee. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from \nSouth Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, I thank Senator Daschle for his \nleadership on this amendment and express my high regard for Senator \nCochran as well. We now find ourselves in a circumstance where the \ndrought has gone on for 2001 and 2002 across much of this country, \nincluding in South Dakota, and it has been devastating. There has been \na $2 billion loss to South Dakota's economy alone based on numbers from \nSouth Dakota State University.\n\n[[Page S1330]]\n\n  There is a need for urgent relief and comprehensive relief. We had 79 \nvotes in this body for a $6 billion package last year. Now we find \nourselves in a circumstance where we are being told about fiscal \nconstraints and yet the White House and our colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle are telling us they are willing to borrow $674 \nbillion over the coming decade--$108 billion this next year--for a so-\ncalled tax relief plan, but we do not have the resources for a \ncomprehensive $6 billion drought relief bill in rural America.\n  If ever there was an initiative that would stimulate the economy of \nrural America, it is the comprehensive $6 billion amendment before us \ntoday, and it would fit very nicely within the context of the enormous \nstimulus initiative coming to us from the White House and from our \ncolleagues.\n  While I appreciate the work that has gone into the alternative bill \npresented by the Senator from Mississippi, it is half the money. With \nrespect to aid for livestock producers, arguably the hardest hit, $1.5 \nbillion would be available for livestock under the bill I support and \nSenator Daschle supports as opposed to only $250 million under the \nalternative version.\n  By applying the AMTA payments, we wind up with gross inequities in \nthe plan offered by the other side. In one of my counties, for \ninstance, it is a primary disaster area, but it has been determined \nthat just 23 percent of its 1,200 farmers have experienced crop or hay \nlosses meeting or exceeding the 30-percent threshold that normally \ntriggers disaster relief. That means 77 percent of the farmers in that \ndisaster county have not experienced significant crop or hay losses but \nwill still get an AMTA payment from the alternative plan.\n  Meanwhile, a rancher in a western county in South Dakota with whom I \nspoke this morning said his average AMTA payment is just $250 per year \nbecause he is primarily a cattle producer. Under the alternative plan, \nhe would receive a $250 AMTA payment, which would purchase just a \ncouple bales of hay, and be forced to compete with other producers for \njust $250 million annually remaining for livestock producers, and that \nis spread across the entire country.\n  On top of that, under the alternative plan, producers must pick \ndrought payments from 2001 or 2002, but not from both, and there is \nconcern over a $10 million grant for Texas farmers and $50 million \ncarved out for cotton as opposed to the comprehensive crop loss \ncoverage under the Daschle bill that I am cosponsoring.\n  Simply put, the amendment I have cosponsored provides real, \ncomprehensive aid to crop farmers and livestock producers who suffered \nactual losses to the drought or other natural disasters. The \nalternative plan provides aid to producers regardless of loss. It \nsimply is not fair.\n  It ought to be apparent which bill provides the real assistance and \nreal relief. We are seeing a hemorrhage of farmers and ranchers off the \nland. It hits the youngest producers worst. Those least capitalized are \nleast able to sustain their operations throughout all of this crisis. \nWe have rancher after rancher who have liquidated their animals. Young \npeople are leaving the land. We are falling below the critical mass of \npopulation in many of our rural areas to sustain basic rural \ninstitutions.\n\n  At a time when this body is debating economic stimulus, I can think \nof no other initiative that would do more for rural America than this \n$6 billion drought bill in the context of the $108 billion that has \nbeen proposed by the White House as economic stimulus for this year \nalone.\n  It makes sense for this initiative to pass now. I ask support of the \nDaschle amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, I thank Senator Cochran for all his amendment does \nto deal with the drought and the severe crises in the agricultural \ncommunity in our country.\n  I want to specifically speak about a part of this amendment that \naffects my home State and thank him for the support he has given to the \nfarmers who live in south Texas and who are suffering because Mexico \nhas refused to meet its requirements under the 1944 water treaty with \nthe United States.\n  Farmers, families, and communities in the Rio Grand Valley of Texas \nhave suffered devastating economic losses due to Mexico's refusal to \ncomply with this treaty. The treaty obligates Mexico to allow an \naverage of 350,000 acre feet of water to flow into the Rio Grande River \nannually for the United States, while obligating the United States to \nallow an average of 1.5 million acre feet of water to flow to Mexico \nfrom the Colorado River.\n  Even during the hardest times, since 1944 America has strictly \ncomplied with its obligations under the treaty of 1944, but Mexico has \naccrued a deficit of 1.5 million acre feet. Mexico claims that drought \nconditions in Chihuahua prevented it from releasing Rio Conchos water \ninto the Rio Grande. However, Mexico's agricultural production in \nChihuahua has blossomed.\n  Recent reports by Texas A University's Extension Service, \naccompanied by NASA satellite photographs from the University of Texas, \ndocument Mexico's increased use of irrigation water to promote high \nvalue water-dependent crops such as corn, oats, forage, and vegetables \nin the state of Chihuahua. We can see from this satellite photograph \nthe Madero Reservoir's water storage is at 14-percent capacity on June \n25 of 2002. Even during the low 14-percent water storage, Mexico \ncontinued to irrigate its fields. However, two months later, August 28, \n2002, the Madero's water storage has risen to 75 percent of its total \ncapacity and we still couldn't get Mexico to comply with the treaty and \nfully deliver its water obligations to South Texas this year.\n\n  We cannot stand by and allow our farmers and ranchers to suffer \nbecause an international treaty is not being met. This satellite image \nclearly shows Mexico is holding the water it owes the U.S. While its \nreserves are full, Mexico only delivers the bare minimum this year. \nFurthermore, Mexico is making no effort to repay its debt. I find it \nincomprehensible that Mexico would not even comply this year when it \nclearly has the water available.\n  Mexico's domestic agricultural production is flourishing with U.S. \ntreaty obligated water while the Rio Grande Valley in Texas is \nsuffering from a decline of more than 100,000 acres of farmland, nearly \na $1 billion net loss to the regional economy and 30,000 lost jobs.\n  Many agricultural operations have been forced to go out of business \nand many are expected to fail unless the United States can resolve this \nissue immediately. Agricultural production and its allied industries \nare the economic engines of south Texas. It is one of the few weapons \nthat south Texas has to combat--unemployment and poverty. The United \nStates cannot afford to stand by and allow Mexico's destruction of an \nAmerican industry and the communities and people whose survival depend \non it.\n  Mexico needs to change its water management practices. I have urged \nthe President to press Mexico to immediately comply with its \nobligations, and the President has done so. He has repeatedly talked to \nthe President of Mexico, as have I, and many others. If Mexico \ncontinues its refusal to comply with the 1944 water treaty, I think the \nUnited States must consider renegotiating this treaty with Mexico and \ntaking into consideration the 1.5 million acre feet of water that we \nare sending to Mexico every year from the Colorado River.\n  Texas has suffered severe losses and the Rio Grande Valley's economic \nviability and livelihood depend on this water. The United States has a \nduty to either force Mexico to deliver the water to South Texas or \ncompensate Texas families who are paying the price for this abrogation \nof the treaty.\n  Senator Cochran's amendment has $10 million that would be available \nfor grants through the Texas Department of Agriculture----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used her 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. To help these farmers stay in business. I thank the \nSenator for helping us get through this hard time while we try to make \nMexico keep its commitments.\n\n[[Page S1331]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from Nebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Madam President, I thank the Democratic \nleader for this time to speak about the need for disaster relief, and I \ncommend my good friend and colleague from Mississippi, the chair of the \nSenate Agriculture Committee, for bringing forth his proposal.\n  The debate today is not simply about disaster relief. It is about \neconomic stimulus, and it looks to me as if the debate has already \nbegun. Part of the stimulus package will involve tax cuts. Obviously, \nfor a State such as Nebraska, tax cuts can be helpful, but to many \nfarmers and ranchers who have no taxable income, who are about to lose \ntheir farms, who are about to lose their ranches and everything they \nhave owned and that has been in the family for generations, a tax cut \nsimply is not going to be enough.\n  That is not an argument against the tax cut. It is an argument real \nstimulus. It is an argument in favor of disaster relief.\n  Let's put a face on this problem. Let's go to southwest Nebraska, my \nhome area, not far from Saint Francis, KS, where the distinguished \nDemocratic leader's wife hails from. Randy Peters, who lives on his \nfamily farm that has been in the family for generations, when I say, \nlook, we are getting you tax cuts, he will say, I appreciate that, \nSenator, that is nice. I then say, maybe part of the package will be \neliminating the taxes on your dividends, and he says, that is great \nbut, Senator, but the problem is that right now I do not have any \ntaxable income. I spent all my savings on the farm and so I do not even \nhave any dividends to be sheltered, and besides they are raising my \ntaxes in Lincoln. What can you do to help me?\n  I say to him and I say to my colleagues, the best way we can help \nthose who are experiencing the ravages of this drought is to simply \nmove forward and pass enough in disaster relief to take care of the \nproblem.\n  I have heard, and I suspect it will be suggested, that something is \nbetter than nothing. I agree, something is better than nothing, but in \nthis case, something is just not good enough. We ought to be talking \nabout how we are going to do something that is good enough to take care \nof those who are having this unfortunate experience we are seeing \ntoday.\n  There seems to be no relief in sight from the drought. Every \nforecast, every suggestion for the future, indicates an indefinite \ndrought, but there can be financial relief if we will step forward and \nmake sure we provide for enough, not less than what is required.\n  As we debate the whole area of economic stimulus, I hope we are not \ngoing to be in a position where we say to the White House, we know \nsomething is better than nothing and they know something is better than \nnothing. But we are not going to be able to do everything that is \nnecessary because if we are going to require offsets consistently \nwhether it is disaster relief or other spending, then I suppose the \nquestion has to be raised: Where is the offset on the stimulus package? \nIf that is the case, maybe there is not enough. Something, of course, \nis better than nothing.\n  I do not want to make that argument then, and I do not want to hear \nthat argument now, because something is better than nothing, we \nunderstand that. But when it is not good enough, we ought to strive \ntowards making sure we can look Randy Peters and the family farmers and \nranchers across this Nation who are experiencing these challenges in \nthe eye and say we have done what we can do and it is not just a half a \nloaf to feed you for a very short period of time. Let's do enough to \nmake sure we take care of our agricultural needs for the future.\n  There is not a better way to take care of rural America than to make \nsure our farmers and our ranchers do not lose their farms and ranches \nas an experience of this drought that continues today. It is not over. \nI have termed it ``Drought David'' as one way of getting it some \nattention so it has an identity. What I want to do is make sure we take \ncare of those farmers and ranchers whose identity may be a little bit \nunknown in the hallowed Halls of the Capitol but whose pain is being \nfelt.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 4 minutes.\n  The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the \ndistinguished Senator from Wyoming, Mr. Thomas.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I rise to support this disaster assistance, one of the \nthings that is most important for us to deal with in the area I come \nfrom.\n  I thank the chairman of the committee for putting this bill forward \nand going back and making it fit the need. We have to send relief to \npeople who have had real disasters. I thank also the Democrat leader \nfor his work. He has worked on it for some time.\n  We do need, of course, to have balance in our spending. We need to \nhave some control. We know that. We have to be reasonable about how we \ndo that.\n  In Wyoming, this is probably the third year of drought. Fortunately, \nup until this last year, we generally had runoff and the irrigating \nsystems worked reasonably well. This year that is less the case. We do \nnot have the kind of storage we have had in the past. We need to deal \nwith this issue.\n  In Wyoming, livestock is at least equally important as the crops. We \nneed to adjust that, which has been done here, to make sure livestock \nis recognized as well.\n  We have had natural disasters throughout the country. We have had tax \nrelief. That is good. But in many cases tax relief is not sufficient \nbecause there is no income to tax. We had a farm bill this year which \nchanged things. We had an unworkable insurance program. We need to do \nsomething about that so it does work.\n  We also now have a farm program that is based on loans for crops. If \nyou do not have a crop, you do not benefit from the farm program. That \nhas been difficult.\n  I am pleased we do have an option. We did have a year ago the \nopportunity and did vote for a disaster bill at that time. Frankly, it \nseemed at the time and still seems that it is very unlikely to pass. We \nhave to have some results as opposed to just talking about it. That is \nwhat we are talking about, something that we can complete for the \npeople throughout the country.\n  This bill is a good bill. The Cochran amendment moves the money \nquickly to those who need it. It goes to those who are needy and have \nhad losses. That is very important.\n  It does include livestock. We need that, certainly. Also, it is the \nkind of budget recognition we need. It has an offset. I urge our \nsupport of the Cochran amendment.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nMontana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I hope my colleagues listen to what I \nhave to say. We all are talking about the need for disaster assistance. \nThat is undisputed. There are provisions in the Cochran amendment which \ndo partially address natural disaster, particularly drought disaster, \nin our country. I say partially. That is wonderful. That is fine.\n  I am quite confident the provisions that have helped Texas producers \nare needed. I also understand in some parts of the country a natural \ndisaster occurred, say, in 2002--not 2001. And the amendment before the \nSenate, the Cochran amendment, provides 1 year, for 2002. I can \nunderstand why some of my colleagues are in favor of the Cochran \namendment because it helps them, it helps their producers.\n  Madam President, I can understand why there are tobacco provisions in \nthe Cochran amendment. I am sure the producers in North Carolina and \nSouth Carolina will get significant benefit from the tobacco \nprovisions. For all I know, it is well intended and deserved and they \nshould have it.\n  We are talking here about a natural disaster. Mother Nature does not \npick and choose years--2001 or 2002. Mother Nature does not choose \nwhich parts of the country it will affect or not affect. Mother Nature \ndoes not choose which farms in a certain county will be hit by disaster \nand which farms in the county are not hit.\n  I start with the good news. Fortunately, the Cochran amendment \nprovides assistance to those parts of America that have experienced \nnatural disasters. That is good.\n\n[[Page S1332]]\n\n  Unfortunately, the Cochran amendment does not provide assistance to \nthose other farmers who have experienced disaster in a different way, \nthose who got hit by disaster in 2001. Nebraska is 2002. Kansas is \n2002. My State of Montana is 2002, but it is also 2001. There are \nseveral years of disaster.\n  The amendment offered by the Senator from South Dakota is designed to \nhelp fairly producers across the country who have experienced natural \ndisasters, irrespective of where they are, irrespective of whether they \nare in a certain county which on average may have 35-percent loss or \nnot.\n  The Cochran amendment is unfair. It helps some producers who have not \nexperienced disasters. That is wrong. The Daschle amendment helps \nproducers who have experienced disasters. That is fair. That is right.\n  I only wish the Senators from Mississippi, North Carolina, and other \nSenators would come to the high plain States and see what a disaster we \nhave. It is sad. It is stunning. It is despairing. It is so sad, \nlooking in people's eyes. Thousands are leaving their places; they are \ndrying up. It is worse this year even than last year, thus far. It may \nrain some more; we do not know.\n  We, across America, have a big heart. We help Americans who need \nhelp. We have helped those who have experienced hurricane losses. We \nhelped those with earthquake damage, say, in California or New York in \nthe Trade Towers. We knew intuitively that is what you do.\n  I say to my colleagues and all those who are helped, remember those \nwho are not sufficiently helped.\n  To sum up in one sentence, we are talking about a few billion. That \ndoes not affect the outyear budget deficit. We can always make \nadjustments. We are all concerned about the deficit. Help our people \nwho need help. In many parts of our country we need help desperately. I \nurge colleagues to put aside the partisanship and do what is right for \nAmerica and vote for farmers who need the help, help offered in the \namendment of the Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Kansas, Mr. Roberts.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I thank the distinguished chairman of the Senate \nAgriculture Committee for yielding time to me.\n  Everyone understands, on a bipartisan basis, I say to the \ndistinguished Senator from Montana, that we are not in very good shape \nwith regard to farm country. It does not matter if you have been hit by \nhurricane, flood, or record-breaking drought.\n  Last spring, I warned this is exactly what would happen because the \ncurrent farm bill was structured to provide assistance to producers \nwhen they had a crop, but left them dangling in the Kansas, Wyoming, \nNebraska, and Montana wind when there was no crop to harvest, not to \nmention other parts of the country suffering these kind of weather \ndisasters.\n  It seems to me, and maybe I took it a little personal, we will not \nget into partisanship because we have to accomplish some degree of \nrelief, but I was criticized on the floor of the Senate last spring. \nThey said I didn't know anything about agriculture because producers \nwith high prices are just fine and need no Government assistance.\n  Well, as everyone here knows, with the wheat, sorghum, corn, and \nsoybean prices have experienced the highest levels in the last few \nyears, but like most of the producers in Kansas or throughout the Great \nPlains or in other sections of the country, it does not do much good if \nall the producer had to harvest was a dust cloud. Prices are high \nbecause the drought cut production and supply.\n  What are we going to do about this? We heard that we have one \napproach that is $6 billion. I question that, really. Not in regard to \nthe intent of the distinguished Senators who brought it forward, but if \nmy second-degree amendment to the $6 billion bill as of last year was \n$2.9 billion, an amendment that was not allowed because of some \nparliamentary maneuvers, now costs $4.03 billion, I have to assume that \nthe $6 billion is probably closer to $7 billion or $8 billion.\n  But that is not really the issue. The issue is the chairman of the \nAgriculture Committee really brought forth this amendment and worked \nwith many of us to ensure that we are directing the bulk of assistance \nto those areas that have actually experienced the crop losses in recent \nyears.\n  This past year in Kansas, we have really gone through a very \ndifficult time. Kansas State University estimates the crop losses in \nthe State at over $1 billion. Thankfully, these have been partially \noffset by $406 million in crop insurance indemnity payments. That is \nthe other half of the equation, and yes we had to improve the crop \ninsurance program in 2000 but thank goodness for that.\n  But the losses are very substantial. Livestock losses total over $300 \nmillion in Kansas; 26 percent of pasture conditions are rated poor to \nvery poor. We have seen a winter, in many parts, the driest on record. \nAnd net farm income is forecast to be approximately $10,000. When all \nis figured in for 2002, this is estimated to represent a shortfall of \nabout $35,000 in simply meeting family living expenses.\n  On top of all this, the total government payments on the 2002 crop \nwere estimated to be 60 percent less than received in 2001.\n  That is right. Under this farm bill described by the other side as \nthe best farm bill ever--the greatest farm bill ever, pardon me--our \nKansas producers have seen a drop of 60 percent in government \nassistance because it is a price support program. We have high prices \nbut no income support. That is why we are back again, despite the \npredictions that we would not have another disaster bill.\n  I heard from many bankers who say there will be no next year for many \nof our producers unless we grant relief. You know, you can't take \nissues and promises to the bank. That is what we have. Issues do not \npay bills. Promises do not pay bills. Debate will not pay bills. We \nneed to give them hope and an assistance package that can actually \npass.\n  Everyone here knows that the House of Representatives will not pass \nthe proposal that has been put forth by my good friends on the other \nside of the aisle. It will not pass the House. There are many reasons \nfor that: Budget reasons, any other reason you can come up with. Some \nsections of agriculture who do not want to open up the farm bill. It \nwill not pass the House. It will not be signed into law by the \nPresident of the United States. That is a given.\n  We can argue the merits of that and the politics of that. We did all \nlast year. But now is not the time to keep arguing about that. Put \npolitics aside. It is not the best bill that I could possibly write or \nthat the distinguished Senator from Mississippi could write, but it is \na bill that will be passed by the House and signed into law by the \nPresident.\n  As I said, the amendment is not perfect, but it does give them hope. \nIt targets assistance to those areas which were actually declared a \ndisaster area. It provides vital livestock assistance that will aid \nproducers throughout the country. It provides assistance for specialty \ncrops. And it does replenish some of the section 22 account so these \nfunds can be used for nutrition programs and purchase programs for \nspecialty crops and the meat sector.\n\n  It doesn't bust the budget; it is paid for. It doesn't take any money \nout of the agriculture baseline.\n  The back of the envelop math is $190 million for Kansas. I don't know \nwhat it is for the other States that are represented here on the floor. \nBut it is substantial. Is it enough? We can argue that all day long. \nBut this is a decision whether we have $190 million that goes to \nKansas, hard-hit Kansas producers and livestock producers, or nothing. \nSo that is the issue.\n  Coming pretty close to the truth is coming pretty close, but it is \nstill not the truth, and that is the truth. We could have an issue or a \nbill. Our farmers are sick and tired of being sick and tired. It may \nwell be that if it doesn't rain, we will be back here again later on \nthis year to try to fix the farm bill, do some technical correction, or \ncome with additional assistance. I don't know. But right now you had \nbetter pass this $3.1 billion package put together by the distinguished \nSenator from Mississippi and backed by some of us who want something as \nopposed to nothing. That is the way it is.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S1333]]\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nNorth Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, this is a very disappointing debate. It \nseems to me, at least, in this Chamber these days, when the big \ninterests have something they need to move through, it moves through \nlike a greased pig, no problem at all. Today we are talking about \nfamily farmers. It is a little more difficult.\n  It is interesting to me to see people who, last year, with 79 votes, \nmany of them participating in the 79 votes to support nearly $6 billion \nin relief for family farmers--help for family farmers to offset the \ndisasters they faced--now are saying somehow that is ill advised. They \nsay the President wouldn't sign this. I will tell you this. The \nPresident cannot sign a bill he won't get. The quick way to decide the \nPresident won't get a bill is to decide he won't support the $6 billion \nthat is needed.\n  I have heard this ``half a loaf'' nonsense forever--a half a loaf is \nbetter. The fact is it is only a half a loaf when it comes to the \nlittle guy. I am talking about people who raise families and raise food \nout on the family farm. They live under the yard light, take all the \nrisks and hope it rains, but not too much, hope the insects don't come, \nhope the crop disease doesn't come, hope it doesn't hail, and hope, if \nthey get a crop, they are able to sell it at a decent price. They take \nall those risks, and then a disaster happens.\n  Let me show this disaster. This chart shows widespread extreme \ndrought in a significant part of our country. This poster shows two \ndifferent scenes in my State. This farmer is standing on farmland, but \nof course you can't grow on farmland inundated with water. In the same \nState, this farmer stands on ranchland with not a bit of vegetation. It \nlooks like a moonscape.\n\n  Is this a disaster? Half a loaf? We can't afford to do what is \nnecessary? Watch the talk here in this Chamber when it comes to tax \ncuts for those at the top of the income ladder. The sky is the limit. \nWe don't have to offset that. Borrow the money. Give them more tax \ncuts. When it comes to the families out there trying to make a living, \nhit by a disaster they didn't cause, all of a sudden we hear all this \nrefrain: What about an offset? What about an offset?\n  I know where this comes from. It comes from the White House. The \nPresident doesn't want to sign this bill. He came to my State and said \nto family farmers: When you need me, I'll be there. We need him, and he \nis not there. I think we ought to send him a bill that doesn't \nrepresent the half a loaf.\n  We have two choices today. One is the bill the Senate has already \npassed by 79 votes. If the same people who believed disaster relief was \nneeded then still feel the same way about family farmers, then we will \npass this amendment. But if you believe we really can't do that because \nwe need to make room for tax cuts for upper income folks--which are not \noffset; we will borrow the money for that--if you feel that way, if \nthat is the choice you want to make, then don't vote for this; vote for \nthe Cochran amendment. But I tell you, it is disappointing.\n  Good enough. You know. Throw somebody drowning under 20 feet of water \n10 feet of rope and say: I am being a good Samaritan here. It is not \nbeing a good Samaritan, in my judgment, for the policy choice to say \nthose economic All-Stars--who live on America's farms, who produce food \nfor a hungry world--are not worthy, when it comes to disaster, to get \nthe full measure of support from this country for what they do.\n  The operative question is, Do we want family farmers in our future? \nDo we care about who farms? Some don't. Some say the agrifactories can \nproduce milk--4,000 cows a day 3 times a day--farm the entire county, \nget $25 million from a farm bill that pays the big interests.\n  It is not what I want to be doing. I want this Congress to recognize \nthat when disaster strikes family farmers, we stand with family \nfarmers. We want to help. Why? Because we want a future in which \nfamilies can live on the land in this country and raise food for a \nhungry world.\n  I just do not understand at all. There are people watching this \ndebate today, who have just spent time with their bankers and their \nlenders, who are not going to be able to go into the field next spring, \nwho are going to have to sell their livestock if we don't pass good \ndisaster relief, if we don't pass the kind of disaster relief that is \navailable in the amendment we have offered.\n  They wait, wondering: Will I be able to continue to farm? They call \nour offices, and some weep, saying: We have done this all of our life. \nWe are not frivolous in spending money. We have done the best job we \ncan, and we are going broke through no fault of our own. The drought \nhas devastated our family, devastated our farm, and we need help.\n  In previous years, this country has said: In these circumstances, let \nus lend a helping hand. Let us extend our hand to say we care about you \nand we want you to remain on the family farm. The only way that is \ngoing to happen is if we pass the bill introduced by my colleague, \nSenator Daschle, and others of us, to make this disaster relief work \nfor family farmers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Idaho, Mr. Craig.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I thank the chairman of the \nAppropriations subcommittee, Senator Cochran, for working with all of \nus to reshape the legislation to fit those and to compensate those and \nhelp those who truly have lost through disaster.\n  That is exactly what the Cochran amendment now does. In so shaping \nthat, we are also able to fit in those livestock farmers and ranchers \nwho lost grazing and need some more assistance for food supplementation \nand hay supplementation for their livestock. We already provided them \nin October with substantial assistance. This is in addition to that.\n  I am not a midwesterner. I can't talk about the extent of the drought \ndown in the Midwest as my colleague from North Dakota just did. But I \ncan tell you that the 44 counties of Idaho which are split by two time \nzones, three air sheds, and three different moisture patterns did \nrather well this year. With commodity prices up, they are doing better \nthan they probably had anticipated they would at the beginning of this \ncrop season a year ago. But 27 counties did experience extreme drought \nconditions. They do mostly irrigation there. The pastureland and the \ngrazing lands there were badly damaged and livestock had to be brought \nin early. High-priced hay had to be purchased to feed the livestock in \norder to sustain or maintain the family operation. That drove up the \ncost of hay for the dairy farmer. While none of this goes to the dairy \nfarmer, his costs of operation have gone up substantially.\n  What I think we have to recognize is what we do is a balance in the \nfirst instance. What we ought to be doing is dealing with those who \ntruly experienced loss through natural disaster, as the Cochran \namendment now does. That is what is important. That is what we ought to \nbe about.\n  We have a farm bill that some of us voted for and some didn't. I can \ntell you it is probably not the farm bill I would have written. But we \nnow have it. There are those in the Chamber who will claim it is their \nwork product and that we are working to implement it and make it work. \nWe ought not just be constantly adding to it and having it become the \nsecond largest income source for American agriculture. It doesn't work \nvery well if we are the ones who they end up depending upon mostly. But \nwhen a natural disaster strikes--whether it be a drought or a hurricane \nor too much water and a flood--that is what we do best. And that is \nwhat we ought to be about.\n  That is exactly what the Senator from Mississippi and I and others \nare attempting to address in the Cochran amendment. Yes. Money will \ncome to Idaho--not as much as to others. But I believe this is a \nbalanced and appropriate way to deal with a bill that will get to the \nPresident's desk and that will be signed.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to express my support for the \namendment that has been introduced\n\n[[Page S1334]]\n\nby our distinguished Democratic leader. This amendment reflects the \ndisaster assistance packages that the Senate passed three times last \nyear, but in each of these cases the House of Representatives failed to \ngo along with these measures. Most convincingly, this amendment last \npassed the Senate by a vote of 79-16. I cosponsored that amendment as \nwell because it provided much needed assistance to our Nation's farmers \nwho have suffered significant crop losses during the past 2 crop years. \nFarmers throughout the Nation have suffered great losses, and farmers \nin my home State of Michigan have been among those who have suffered \nmost.\n  Two years of statewide crop failure have threatened the viability of \nmany of Michigan's farmers, and this amendment strives to address the \nlosses suffered by growers in the 2001 and 2002 growing years. Over the \npast 2 years, some farmers faced early warm temperatures followed by \nfreezing conditions. For others, torrential rains came early in the \ngrowing season and were followed by long droughts. Still other farmers \nfaced drought conditions at the start of the crop year and heavy rains \nat harvest time.\n  Last year, USDA Secretary Ann Veneman recognized the atypical weather \nconditions that greatly diminished crop production in Michigan by \ndesignating all of Michigan's 83 counties as disaster areas. If that \nwas not bad enough, Secretary Veneman designated 82 of Michigan's 83 \ncounties as official disaster areas in 2001.\n  Michigan is one of the Nation's most diverse States in terms of the \nsheer breadth and number of crops grown in it, and growers of many \ncrops have been affected by adverse weather conditions. Total losses \nfor Michigan farmers for both 2001 and 2002 are roughly estimated at \n$314 million. For 2 years, I have met with many farmers who want to \nknow if they will receive assistance. Assistance is what farmers in \nMichigan and throughout the Nation need.\n  Last year, cherry farmers in Michigan lost upwards of 95 percent of \ntheir crops, a level that threatens to devastate Michigan and the \nNation's cherry industry, given that Michigan produces over 70 percent \nof the tart cherries in the Nation. Last summer, I had the opportunity \nto visit with cherry growers in Michigan and listen to them as they \ntold me how this year's crop losses were the worst that the industry \nhad ever suffered since crop records have been kept. Additionally, 80 \npercent of all Michigan apple farmers have lost upwards of 40 percent \nof their crop this year.\n  In 2001, farmers in just one area of Michigan, which is one of the \nleading dry bean producing regions in the Nation, lost 85 percent of \ntheir bean crop. Due to severe drought, bean growers who export every \nother row they grow, lost 85 percent of their crops.\n  Across the state, in the southwest corner of Michigan, Labrusca grape \ngrowers lost 80 percent of their crop and they suffered similar losses \nthis year. While the losses suffered by bean and grape growers are \nparticularly severe, they are not the only crops to have suffered \ndrastic losses.\n  Approximately 25 percent of apple growers in Michigan and across the \nNation are in danger of going out of business in the next 2 years, and \nin Michigan that means that our cherry, peach, and asparagus crops, \nwhich are often grown on the same orchards as apples, will be greatly \ndecreased. Orchard communities around the country have been devastated. \nOrchard operators still have very high operating expenses even if they \ndo not harvest a crop. Orchards must be tended to all year long. \nActivities such as pruning and spraying are expensive to conduct, but \nthey must be done even when there is no crop.\n  As farmers have left the business, small businesses and cooperatives \nthat have been around for generations have also gone out of business, \nand local governments have lost significant tax revenue. This \nassistance will allow many growers to reduce debt and get private bank \nor USDA loans for the next growing season. This assistance for will \ngive farmers the shot in the arm they need to recover from several \nyears of low prices. This aid is the economic stimulus package for \nrural America.\n  Our Nation's farmers have not shared in the prosperity which many \nAmericans have experienced over the past decade. No one, least of all \nAmerica's farmers, likes the fact that annual emergency agriculture \nsupplementals have seemingly become routine.\n  Yet, we must provide this assistance if we are to address the \nproblems facing farmers throughout the Nation. Several growers have \ntold me that the crop losses they suffered this past year were so \nsevere that without emergency assistance they will most likely lose \ntheir farms. This assistance is not the answer to the problems facing \nour farmers and rural America, but it is an important part of an effort \nto keep families on their farms. I thank the Senator for South Dakota \nfor his efforts in offering this amendment.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I would like to express my support of \nthe amendment introduced by my colleague, Mr. Daschle, because it \nprovides emergency disaster relief to farmers. During the past 2 years, \nMother Nature has not been kind to farmers and bad weather has \ndevastated their crops and threatened the survival of family farms.\n  New York State experienced statewide drought this past growing \nseason. Farmers across the State have struggled with lower crop yields \nand higher feed prices for their livestock. Fifty-five counties in the \nState have been designated as primary disaster counties by the \nSecretary of Agriculture, which includes all of New York's agricultural \ncounties.\n  But in New York, crop damage has not come solely from drought. \nUnseasonably high temperatures in the spring followed by frost and \nhailstorms have devastated specialty crops such as such as apples, \npeaches, pears, grapes, strawberries, stone fruits, onions, and \ncherries. And the disasters have not just been limited to the 2002 crop \nyear--many farmers in New York were also hurt because of adverse \nweather in 2001.\n  The unfortunate result of this disastrous weather is that a large \npercentage of these farmers, particularly those that produce specialty \ncrops, are bordering on financial ruin. I have met with the farmers and \ngrowers of New York, and their stories are heartbreaking as they talk \nabout bankruptcy and selling off their family's farm. For many \nspecialty crops, adequate crop insurance that would cover more than \ncatastrophic losses is not available. Crop disaster relief is truly \nneeded to keep these farms going as well as the rural economies that \nthey support. Time is running short for these hard-working families in \nNew York, and they need our help.\n  The funding that Senator Cochran has proposed would give our farmers \nin New York and across the Nation the relief they need. While it \nprovides a total of $100 million for specialty crops, these funds are \nnot focused on those who have incurred weather-related losses. In 2002 \nalone, New York's apple growers sustained damage of over $80 million. \nThe amount provided by Senator Cochran is not enough to address these \nlosses and the tremendous needs of other New York crops--such as \nLabrusca grapes, peaches, pears, strawberries, stone fruits, onions, \nand cherries. And this says nothing to the financial needs of specialty \ncrop producers across the entire country.\n  In addition, the amendment by Senator Cochran would not fully \nreplenish section 32 funds that the administration took last year from \nprograms designed to feed impoverished urban, suburban, and rural \nresidents. Without fully replenishing these funds, the ability of \nnutrition and food aid programs to assist citizens in need may be \ncompromised. New York has many in need of food aid, and I cannot stand \nby while this form of assistance is in jeopardy. The amendment proposed \nby Senator Daschle does address these needs, and that is why I ask my \ncolleagues to support this emergency disaster assistance package.\n  I have worked with my colleagues in the past to pass legislation that \nwould provide financial relief to farmers who have suffered losses due \nto natural disasters in 2001 or 2002. I supported the farm bill last \nyear which included disaster aid. I cosponsored S. 2800, a bill that \nwould provide emergency disaster assistance to agricultural producers. \nAnd I cosponsored the crop disaster amendment to the Interior \nAppropriations that passed with 79 votes.\n  In the 108th Congress, I have cosponsored S. 21, which would again \nprovide emergency disaster assistance to agricultural producers as well \nas restore\n\n[[Page S1335]]\n\nsection 32 funding. And I support Senator Daschle today, in his \ncontinued efforts on behalf of this Nation's farmers who have suffered \ndisaster, our rural communities who depend upon farm incomes, and those \nin this Nation who are hungry.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would like to voice my support today for \nSenator Daschle's amendment which provides emergency disaster \nassistance for crop and livestock producers who have suffered losses \nduring the 2001 and 2002 agriculture production years due to natural \ndisasters.\n  For U.S. farmers and ranchers, the current production disaster is \nmultifaceted. In many areas, drought has decimated crops and has \nreduced water supplies available for livestock. In other regions, \nfarmers are experiencing crop destruction and reduced yields and \nquality due to flooding and an increased incidence of crop pests and \ndiseases. Especially hard hit are the specialty crops such as apples, \ncherries, and grapes in the Great Lakes region, the Eastern States and \nthe Pacific Northwest that suffered frost, freeze, and drought damage \nthis season and adverse weather in 2001.\n  The negative economic impact of natural disasters to American \nagriculture and rural communities continues to grow. In my home State \nof Massachusetts, the cranberry industry suffered $10 million loss in \n2002 from drought alone. The situation across the Nation is the same: \nour farmers are in trouble and Congress needs to step in and provide \nassistance.\n  It is for those reasons I support the Daschle amendment. Unlike the \nCochran amendment, it provides equitable disaster assistance to those \nproducers--crop and specialty crop alike--who were impacted by \ndisasters.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the Cochran \namendment. This package is the result of a concentrated effort to \nprovide speedy and targeted assistance to agricultural producers who \nhave suffered from drought and other disasters.\n  At $3.1 billion, the size of this package is not as large as what I \nhave supported in the past. But the time has come to support and pass \nassistance in the Senate that our agricultural producers actually \nreceive. The Senate passed drought assistance numerous times in 2001, \nbut each time the provisions were stripped by the House.\n  Today we have an opportunity to pass desperately needed drought \nassistance that for the first time has a good chance of landing in \nproducers' pockets and not in the trash can across the street. The \nPresident has consistently asked that drought assistance be offset and \nthat it be budget neutral. This amendment is budget neutral.\n  The Cochran amendment targets assistance to producers in counties \nthat have been declared primary disaster areas. It uses a mechanism to \ndistribute the assistance that will not burden the FSA with another \nlong sign up period and excessive paperwork. It is an improvement over \nwhat is currently in the omnibus bill because it specifies $250 million \nfor the Livestock Assistance Program.\n  The Cochran amendment specifically benefits Wyoming producers in a \nnumber of ways. The amendment reimburses producers in my State that \ngrazed their own Conservation Reserve Program acres this fall for the \n25 percent reduction in their CRP payment. The amendment also provides \n$80 million to sugar beet producers who have suffered production losses \nin the 2002 crop year. Many of those sugar beet producers live in my \nState. I know they will be grateful for the assistance that will help \nthem maintain a number of sugar beet cooperatives.\n  Wyoming's current drought situation is serious. Because the need is \nso great, I will support the Cochran amendment. It is better to provide \na simple meal to a starving man than promise a feast and not deliver.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Cochran amendment and responsibly \nprovide drought assistance to the people who have waited so long.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, last week, I saw that $3.1 billion was \nincluded for drought assistance in the omnibus funding bill. It was a \ngood way to start the day, until I started to dig deeper. Montana \nproducers will not receive meaningful relief from these funds.\n  I am fighting today for full funding for both 2001 and 2002 for the \ncrop disaster program, livestock assistance program, and the American \nIndian livestock feed program that 79 Members of the Senate agreed to \non September 10, 2002.\n  I have spent a lot of time visiting producers on their farms and \nranches in Montana. And each time I am stunned by the desperation in \ntheir voices and in their eyes, stunned by the way the winds are \nblowing away their topsoil and their herds are getting smaller and \nsmaller.\n  I cannot stress how important it is that we quickly pass meaningful \ndrought disaster assistance. The unrelenting drought in Montana has \nbrought economic hardship to our agriculture producers and our rural \ncommunities.\n  The same way we use emergency funds to rebuild communities hurt by \ntornadoes and hurricanes, we should use emergency funds to rebuild our \ncommunities hurt by drought. There is no reason that a double standard \nshould apply to agriculture.\n  And the situation has become even more devastating, since many of \nthese regions are suffering their third, fourth, or fifth year of \nconsecutive drought conditions.\n  According to the New York Times on May 3, 2002, ``In eastern Montana, \nmore than a thousand wheat farmers have called it quits rather than \ntrying to coax another crop out of the ground that has received less \nrain over the last 12 months than many deserts get in a year.''\n  It is anticipated that another 1,300 Montana wheat producers will \ncall it quits if disaster assistance is not provided.\n  The effects of the drought have gone beyond our farmers and ranchers. \nBusinesses are closing their doors, employees are being laid off, and \nmain streets are literally drying up.\n  According to Dale Schuler, past president of Montana Grain Growers \nand a farmer in Choteau County, MT, nearly 2,000 square miles of crop \nin his area of central Montana have gone unharvested. That is an area \nthe size of Delaware. ``Farmers and our families have not had the means \nto repay our operating loans, let alone buy inputs to plant the crop \nfor the coming year.''\n  Dale added, ``Chouteau County is the largest farming county in \nMontana, and yet our last farm equipment dealer had no choice but to \nclose his doors, our local co-op closed its tire shop, one farm fuel \nsupplier quit, and the fertilizer dealers and grain elevators are \nlaying off workers. I believe that we are set to see a mass exodus from \nMontana that has not been seen since the Great Depression of the \n1930's.\n  On September 3, 2002, the Wall Street Journal printed an article that \nstated that, ``the U.S. may be looking at the most expensive drought in \nits history, inflicting economic damage far beyond the Farm Belt.''\n  Loans have been made with the understanding that Congress was going \nto provide disaster assistance because as a country and a Government \nthat is what we as Americans do. We rush to provide assistance to \nvictims of hurricanes and tornadoes. As we all know, that is not what \nhas occurred with the drought.\n  Now we have bankers who are desperately trying to not call loans due \nand producers who are desperately trying to scrape enough together to \nmake the bank hold on just a little longer.\n  Producers are considering selling parcels of land or pieces of \nequipment that they have considered vital to their operation. They will \ndo it if it means that they can keep the farm or ranch that their \nfamily has been working for generations. Scraping that money together \nhas never been more difficult as most of the potential buyers are in \nsimilar financial straits.\n  The devastation of this drought does not end at the front door of our \nrural homes. The enormous economic toll of this relentless drought on \nour communities will take years to recover.\n  However, the toll on our rural families is irreparable. Incidents of \ndomestic abuse, suicides, and alcoholism have increased significantly \nin the past 2 years. We must not continue to let our inability to \nuphold our responsibilities cripple rural communities any longer.\n  We cannot and must not continue to ignore the impacts of drought and \nthe effect it has on our agricultural producers and our rural \ncommunities. Agricultural producers are every bit as\n\n[[Page S1336]]\n\ndeserving of assistance for their suffering from the drought as the \nsmall business owner in Louisiana suffering from a hurricane.\n  I cannot urge more strongly my colleagues in the House and Senate to \nwork together to pass full funding for natural disaster assistance for \nboth 2001 and 2002. I, again, ask the President to live up to the words \nhe spoke almost a year ago when he said that the agriculture economy is \nvital to the national economy. It is vital that we pass agriculture \ndisaster assistance immediately to help our producers, to help our \neconomy, and to help our Nation.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the agriculture \ndisaster assistance funding included in the fiscal year 2003 omnibus \nappropriations bill. The farmers and ranchers in Missouri have suffered \nthrough bad weather and depressed prices, threatening their ability to \nstay in business. Agriculture is the cornerstone of the Missouri \neconomy and I am pleased that the Senate was able to provide much \nneeded assistance to these producers.\n  Over the past 3 years, the agriculture community has faced droughts, \nflooding and insect infestations that have damaged yields and reduced \nprofits. This package provides a responsible level of assistance to \nthose who have suffered or continue to suffer substantial losses as a \nresult of natural disasters.\n  After months of political maneuvering, the Senate finally passed a \nnew farm bill last year. This legislation provided increased economic \nresources, certainty, and stability across a wide range of agricultural \nand rural programs. However, the new farm bill is incapable of \npredicting and adequately dealing with natural disasters. The floods \nand droughts have deteriorated Missouri's agriculture production and \nexposed the shortcomings of these new farm programs.\n  I have heard from producers around Missouri. Our farmers need this \nadditional assistance to secure their operating loans for the 2003 crop \nyear. Agriculture producers and lenders can include this assistance in \ncashflow projections. This $3.1 billion will give farmers great \nassistance as they make planting decisions for the upcoming crop year.\n  Depressed prices, falling farm income, weather disasters and unstable \nglobal markets present a host of challenges to production agriculture. \nThis assistance, made through direct payments and the additional funds \nfor the livestock compensation program, enables farmers in Missouri and \nacross the country, to continue to produce the safest, most abundant \nand affordable food in the world.\n  I support this targeted disaster assistance measure that would bring \ngreat equity to Missouri's farmers and ranchers.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \namendment offered by the Senator from South Dakota to address the \ncritical needs of our Nation's family farmers affected by natural \ndisaster.\n  Over the past 2 years, farmers throughout the Nation have been \ndevastated by periods of prolonged drought and other natural disasters. \nLast year, in my own State of Maryland, the drought was among the most \ndestructive in our history. Over the summer, as I traveled through the \nrural areas of my State, I saw firsthand the damage that had been done. \nThe fields were dry and the crops withered. According to the Department \nof Agriculture, corn production was down 42 percent from 2001 and both \nthe corn crop and yield were the smallest in 14 years. Similarly, \nsoybean production was down 46 percent from the previous year and the \ncrop and yield were the worst in 15 years.\n  At the urging of the Maryland Congressional Delegation, the Secretary \nof Agriculture declared 21 of the State's 23 counties primary natural \ndisaster areas. And, as a result, farmers in the disaster areas and the \ntwo contiguous counties became eligible for emergency loans. \nUnfortunately, for many farmers, taking on additional loans is just not \npossible.\n  The Daschle amendment will provide meaningful disaster relief to \nthose farmers in Maryland and throughout the Nation. The amendment, \nsimilar to one that passed the Senate with my support and that of 78 of \nmy colleagues in the last Congress, provides approximately $6 billion \nin direct emergency disaster assistance to producers who have been \ndirectly impacted by drought or natural disaster. This amendment has \nthe support of more than 40 farm, ranch, and rural organizations, \nincluding the American Farm Bureau Federation and the National Farmers \nUnion.\n  In my view, this amendment will provide our farmers with a much \nneeded safety net, one not included in the recently passed farm bill, \nthat will allow them to maintain their livelihoods and their lands. I \nurge my colleagues to join me in supporting its passage.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \nsupport the Daschle amendment providing emergency assistance to our \nNation's family farmers suffering weather-related natural disaster \nlosses in 2001 and 2002 and to oppose the Republican alternative.\n  The Daschle amendment offers several distinct advantages over the \nRepublican alternative offered by Senator Cochran.\n  Unlike the Daschle amendment, the Republican alternative requires \ndeep cuts in discretionary programs. And the cuts will have a dramatic \nimpact on many Americans. This across-the-board cut would eliminate: \n1,175 FBI Agents; 490 Food Safety Inspectors; 1,600 Customs inspectors, \n(fewer inspectors than pre 9/11); kick 2,722 children off early \nchildhood education, (added to original cuts totals 5,522 children); \nkick 224,689 women, infants and children off WIC; and leave 230,000 \nVeterans without medical services.\n  Never before has Congress insisted that emergency assistance be \noffset by cuts in other programs. We don't do this for hurricane \nrelief. We shouldn't do it for drought relief.\n  Unlike the Daschle amendment, the Republican alternative doesn't \ntarget assistance to those who suffered from a disaster. In fact, it \npays producers who did not suffer a disaster.\n  Historically, producers must show that they personally suffered a \nqualifying loss before receiving federal disaster assistance. But the \nRepublican amendment does away with this important requirement.\n  So, under their proposal, if a single producer in a county suffers a \nqualifying loss, every producer in the county and every contiguous \ncounty will be eligible to receive a payment. It's wasteful and fails \nto ensure that those producers who really need the help get it.\n  Unlike the Daschle amendment, the Republican alternative fails to \nfully restore food assistance funds to the Section 32 account.\n  Back in September, the administration raided money set aside to buy \nfood commodities for school lunches and our Nation's food banks to pay \nfor the Livestock Compensation Program.\n  The payments to drought-stricken farmers were desperately needed, but \nthe administration never should have taken these funds, which were \nspecifically targeted for the hungry.\n  In his amendment, Senator Cochran recognizes the blatant unfairness \nof the administration's move and restored about half of the funds \nneeded. But with our weak economy and growing food lines, now is not \nthe time for half measures.\n  The Daschle amendment will put the food assistance program back on a \nsound financial footing, allowing soup kitchens and food banks to keep \nhelping hungry families.\n  For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to support the Daschle \namendment and to oppose the Republican alternative.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democrat leader has 13 minutes 31 seconds. \nThe Senator from Mississippi has 8 minutes 25 seconds.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, following up on what the distinguished \nSenator from Idaho was talking about--operating costs--in a State such \nas Michigan, which has great diversity, we have a very large number of \nfruit and vegetable growers. I remember hearing from Fred Tubbs who has \n40 acres of cherries. He says even\n\n[[Page S1337]]\n\nthough he lost his crop and even though he had been devastated this \nyear, he has to continue to spray. He has to continue to have \noperational costs as well.\n  My grave concern about the Cochran amendment is so many of our \nfarmers--particularly family farmers--have been left out of this \namendment. People such as Fred Tubbs have--with operating costs whether \nor not they have a crop.\n  We have two choices in front of us: The Daschle amendment and the \nCochran amendment. The Cochran amendment is not a disaster package. \nThat is very clear. There are farmers who did not have a disaster and \nmay have had a bumper crop who will be helped under this amendment. \nStates that have seen devastation in crops such as soy beans would be \nhelped under this provision. But grape growers, apple growers, cherry \ngrowers, asparagus, peaches, plums--all of those fruit and vegetable \ngrowers who have been devastated in my State would not receive \nassistance under this plan.\n  There is a small provision in the Cochran amendment that would \nprovide $100 million set aside for fruits and vegetables. I will just \nshare with my colleagues that in Michigan alone the fruit and vegetable \nlosses are $180 million. The amount in this bill is $100 million for \nthe entire country. Our farmers deserve better than this. We can do \nbetter.\n  I also indicate that the bill provides a small amount--$250 million \nin the Cochran amendment--for section 32 as it relates to nutrition and \nthe purchase of fruits and vegetables. Unfortunately, that is far less \nthan the $1 billion that was removed last year for livestock \nassistance.\n  Our fruit and vegetable growers were very pleased the first time we \npassed a farm bill last year that included them--that recognized our \nfruit and vegetable growers across the country. Yet we are seeing \nattempts at every turn to eliminate the assistance that was placed into \nthe farm bill.\n  It is time for the Daschle amendment; it is time to provide needed \ndisaster assistance for both losses in 2001 and 2002.\n  I urge my colleagues to do the right thing for our farmers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Minnesota, Mr. Coleman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Madam President, I thank the Senator for yielding the \ntime.\n  I rise in support of the Cochran amendment. Last year when I was \nrunning for the U.S. Senate, I promised to get something done in the \nway of relief for Minnesota farmers. The picture the distinguished \nSenator from North Dakota showed is a picture that is close to the \nheart of Minnesotans who suffered disasters. They have suffered \nflooding. They have been hurt. They have suffered losses.\n  Last year, the House and the Senate attempted to pass the Daschle \nlegislation, but it never became law. Those two bills looked good on \npaper, but they never became law. They never lightened the load of one \nfarmer. They never comforted one farm family. They never provided a \nsingle auction.\n  When I ran for the Senate, I promised to get to work to get something \ndone for disaster relief for Minnesota farmers. I never promised to \nvote for something that everyone knows is going nowhere, and then shrug \nmy shoulders and say: Gee whiz, I tried. I promised to shoot straight \nfor the people back home and to be honest about what I think can be \ndone and then help it become law. No one believes the alternative \ndisaster package now scored by the Congressional Budget Office at \nnearly $7 billion has support to become law. I think it is \nirresponsible to raise hopes and expectations to that level.\n  I was elected to get something done. I have some serious concerns \nabout the $3.1 billion disaster package in the Cochran amendment. In my \nview, the help provided in this bill needed to be better targeted to \nfarmers hit by disaster. I was among a number of Senators who expressed \nconcerns to the chairman of the Agriculture Committee. He went back to \nthe drawing board. He made some changes to better target the help. \nAlthough he didn't go as far as I would like, we are going to get \nsomething done for Minnesota farmers. Farmers can't cashflow on \npromises alone. They need help now. I am told this $3.1 billion relief \npackage can get help to our farm families within weeks. I am going to \nsupport this $3.1 billion package. I was elected to get things done. \nThe Cochran amendment gets things done. Let's pass it and let us move \non.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I hear over and over from the other side \nthat we can't get it done. That is a self-fulfilling prophecy. We have \ngotten it done for 4 years, before last year, every year. When farmers \nsuffered a natural disaster, we responded--and we responded with the \npackage we are offering today. This isn't some new formulation. This \nisn't something that has never been done before. It was done every year \nbefore when farmers suffered from a natural disaster. All of a sudden, \nthe other side throws up their hands and says they cannot do it. The \nreason they can't do it is they will not vote for it. Vote for it, and \nwe will pass it here, and then we will be able to go to the House and \nfight it out with them.\n\n  This notion that we should give in to what the House might agree to, \nI have never heard of that working very well in the Senate. We are the \nmasters of our destiny. We represent the people who sent us here. We \nshould not abrogate our responsibility to what the House might do or \nmight not do. We ought to do what has been done for 4 years in the past \nand reach out and help a part of the country that has been devastated.\n  A headline in the Wall Street Journal of today reads: ``Midwest \nDrought Is Threatening Agriculture, Rivers and Tourism.''\n  The article begins, ``A severe drought that began in the Great Plains \nis engulfing the Midwest this winter, snarling the Mississippi River, \ncrippling snow-dependent businesses, and increasing the likelihood for \npoor crops at a time when the nation's grain supply is precariously \nlow.''\n  That is the Wall Street Journal.\n  The package offered on the other side isn't a disaster package. A \nfarmer isn't required to have a farm loss in order to get a payment. \nLet me repeat that. You do not have to have a crop loss to get a \npayment under the plan being offered on the other side.\n  No. 2, every eligible farmer--which could be as many as 97 percent of \nthe farmers in this country--could get the same level of payment \nregardless of what loss they suffer. Even if they have no loss, if they \nare in a disaster county, they get help.\n  Now we see the appearance, in this proposal, of $53 million in direct \npayments to tobacco producers--not tobacco producers that have had a \ndisaster but just tobacco producers.\n  This is not a disaster bill. I don't know what one would term it, but \nit is not disaster assistance, not the disaster assistance we gave 4 \nyears in a row before last year.\n  The proposal on the other side provides one-half of what was done in \nevery previous year--one-half. That does not meet the test of what is \nrequired. We ought to pass what we know is right, what we have done \nbefore, what we have provided in assistance every time in the past when \nthere was a natural disaster; and that is the Daschle proposal. I hope \nmy colleagues will support it.\n  The difference is dramatic. In my State, if a farmer suffers a full \nloss, they get $6.50 an acre under the proposal from the other side. \nUnder the Daschle proposal, they get $45 an acre. But under the \nRepublican proposal, if you did not suffer a loss, you get $6.50 an \nacre. If you did not have any loss--and it does not matter under the \nRepublican proposal what level of loss you suffer--you get the same \npayment. We have never designed a disaster package that way.\n  I hope colleagues will think very carefully about this vote and \nprovide the parts of the country that have suffered natural disaster \nwith a natural disaster package.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n\n[[Page S1338]]\n\n  The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the \ndistinguished Senator from Montana, Mr. Burns.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Madam President, I thank my friend from Mississippi. And I \nthank my friend from South Dakota for his work.\n  I want to make a couple of points because I guess we are all trying \nto say the same thing; it is just that everybody has not had an \nopportunity to say it.\n  The farming business is just as competitive as any other business. \nBut let's go back and think a little bit. You have 2 years here: 2001 \nand 2002. You also have a section in this bill that deals with CRP. But \nI am going to make sure that something gets to the President of the \nUnited States. That is what I am going to do.\n  I may end up supporting both of them. Somewhere in the middle we will \ncome up with a disaster package that provides the right kind of \nassistance to the people who have had actual losses. That is what is \nimportant. It is not one or the other. We were operating under a \ndifferent bill the last 2 or 3 years that the Senator from North Dakota \nwas referring to, completely different. There is no question in my mind \nthat we are looking at a year now or a Congress now where we are going \nto have to take a look at risk management and how we manage our risk.\n  I am pragmatic. I do not want to mislead my people in the State of \nMontana who are going into their 6th year of drought. We know what it \nis all about. So I will probably support both amendments. But I want to \nmake sure we get one to conference so we can deal with some of those \nspecific areas in order to get the money to the people who have \nactually experienced the impact of this drought.\n  I thank the chairman of the committee. I also appreciate the \nleadership of the Democratic leader.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). Who yields time?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, 19 Minnesota counties were declared \ndisaster areas last year because of severe flooding. Many of those same \ncounties were devastated the year before. In fact, many of the same \nfarmers lost their entire crops in both of the last 2 years.\n  That is real disaster. Whether it is a record drought in South Dakota \nor flooding in Minnesota, we know the vicissitudes of Mother Nature are \nones that no farmer can predict and no farmer, in this case, can \nsurvive.\n  Last year the Senate bill contained disaster assistance. We \nunderstood that it did not make sense to have a bill where if you \nsuffered some loss--you were going to get a lower price--you were going \nto get a countercyclical payment, but if you suffered complete loss, \nyou would get nothing at all. But the House would not agree to that \nbecause the administration was opposed to it.\n  I was confused for a while about the administration talking about \n``compassionate conservative'' because I thought they meant both the \nwords together. But I have concluded they mean one or the other. If it \nis tax breaks for the wealthiest people in this country, then they are \nvery compassionate. If they are talking about farmers who are on the \nbrink of disaster, they are very conservative.\n  For big corporations and, indeed, new tax shelters, they are very \ncompassionate. For unemployed workers, they are very conservative.\n  In this case, we need more compassion. And we can also be \nconservative because, in fact, this package is eminently affordable.\n  The distinguished new chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee \nwas quoted as saying that the figure he had received from the \nadministration, from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, in terms of \nthe savings in this year's farm bill, was $5 billion. That is almost \nthe entire cost of Senator Daschle's amendment. Certainly, in the \ncontext of everything else that is being proposed by the \nadministration, an additional $1 billion for farmers who are destitute \nwould be very much affordable.\n  I might also say this is economic stimulus. This is money that will \ngo in the pockets of farmers who will go out literally the next day to \npay for goods and services in their communities. Those dollars multiply \nfour times through the communities in Minnesota, twice more through the \nState, and once more at the Federal level.\n  This, along with extending unemployment benefits, is the kind of \neconomic stimulus that really gets the country moving forward and helps \npeople who need a helping hand. It does everything that the Government \nought to be doing for the people who need it rather than the people who \ndo not.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today we have the ability to address a \nproblem that has been neglected for the last 18 months. For 18 months \nfarmers have been waiting for 2001, and now 2002 disaster assistance, \nbut partisanship kept us from providing rural America with relief. \nToday, we will provide the remedy.\n  Today the Senate has the opportunity to address the issue of \nsignificant loss in the agriculture community due to natural disasters. \nIn Iowa we have experienced both drought and flood during the last 2 \nyears. For instance, last year the eastern side of the State--counties \nsuch as Clayton, Delaware, Jackson, Clinton, and Scott--had a disaster \nin 2002 due to flood. In 2001, the southern two tiers of counties in \nIowa experienced drought. Turning back to 2002 again, one of Iowa's \nbest production years ever, we saw counties such as Harrison, Mills, \nAdams and Cass turn up bone dry during critical states of the growing \nseason.\n  Iowa had record yields in 2002, but we did not have uniformity in \nstate-wide averages of precipitation or production and that has made \nthe package we are debating today very important to many family farmers \nin my home State.\n  The agriculture assistance package I have worked on with Chairman \nCochran and other Members provides $3.1 billion of assistance to areas \nand individuals with the greatest need. Our proposal will give \nassistance to farmers who live in ``primary'' designated disaster \ncounties and to farmers who have had a 35 percent crop loss outside of \nthose primary counties. We will be able to get checks to the farmers in \nthe primary designated counties within 4 weeks after the President \nsigns the bill. The farmers who can account for a 35 percent crop loss \nwill need to go to their local FSA office and sign-up for assistance.\n  Our program also contains an additional $250 million for the \nLivestock Assistance Programs--LAP provides direct payments to eligible \nlivestock producers who suffered grazing losses due to natural \ndisaster--and offers a sense of the Senate that encourages the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture to provide surplus dry milk supplies to pork \nproducers to use as feed.\n  Some members of the Senate will try to make ``political hay'' out of \nthis by opposing our proposal. They will say the need is greater than \n$3.1 billion and our assistance isn't focused, but the fact is the only \nway the House of Representatives and the White House are going to allow \nus to spend more on agriculture, after we have already spent over $180 \nbillion on the other agriculture disaster we experienced last year, the \n2002 farm bill, is if we ``find'' the money through offsets.\n  Those who choose to oppose this proposal will claim that their \nproposal was better for rural America, but what good is a proposal that \ncan't pass? We tried it their way; I voted for emergency funding more \nthan once, but the Senate leadership was unsuccessful in advancing any \nassistance to rural America. In fact, the last time I voted for \nemergency spending we couldn't even get it off the floor of the Senate. \nDoesn't it seem reasonable that we should actually vote on something \nthat can actually pass? Isn't tangible assistance better than empty \npromises?\n  The assistance in our proposal will get to farmers months before the \nassistance in the Democratic alternative. Most farmers will get help \nwithin four weeks after the President signs the legislation, instead of \nwaiting up to eight months under the alternative approach. Family \nfarmers that carry significant debt, or those that have been\n\n[[Page S1339]]\n\nforced to arrange ``bridge loans'' because of the problems with farm \nbill payments need the assistance now to reduce their debt, not eight \nmonths from now when the debt has had plenty of time to build due to \ninterest.\n  Chairman Stevens worked diligently to find an offset that would \nprovide funds to address the current need. I appreciate the work of \nChairman Stevens and thank him for his assistance. I would also like to \nthank Chairman Cochran for working with me and other members to fit \nthis proposal to the need in rural America. Without Chairman Cochran's \ndedication to developing the best proposal possible for rural America \nwe would not have such broad support.\n  Mr. President, family farmers need disaster assistance, not ``pie in \nthe sky'' empty promises that can't make it past the House of \nRepresentatives or the White House. It was important to make sure \nfarmers who need assistance receive help as quickly as possible, and \nwe've done that. I encourage my colleagues to support family farmers \nand support the Cochran amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I think we have had a good discussion of \nthese two amendments that are pending before the Senate. I continue to \nbelieve the way to get the assistance to the farmers in the most \nexpeditious way possible is to vote for the Cochran amendment. The \nreason for that is, the counties that have been declared disaster \ncounties are already a matter of record. With these computer programs \nthat the Department of Agriculture has, sometimes it takes time to get \nto a point where you can actually send out checks if new information is \ngoing to be included in that program.\n  That is what would happen under the alternative presented by my \nfriend from South Dakota. Farmers would have to come in and sign up for \nbenefits. The Department of Agriculture, through the Farm Service \nAgency offices around the country, would have to gather that \ninformation, process it, and submit it to the Department here. I think \nit is not unreasonable to expect there to be months that go by before \nthe checks would actually go to the farmers who need the help; whereas, \nin the Cochran amendment the funds would go out much more \nexpeditiously--I think in a matter of weeks. That has been the \nexperience in the past disaster situations where we have followed this \nkind of benefit program.\n  The percentage of the payment is calculated on the basis of the farm \npayment received by farmers in the past. That is a matter of record. \nThe identity and the addresses, all of that is already in the \ncomputers.\n\n  This is no small matter. You cannot disregard the importance of that \nbecause farmers are hurting now. We have talked about how we don't want \nto put this off. If you vote for the Cochran amendment, you won't be \nputting it off. You will not be putting it off for months before \nfarmers get the benefits to which they are entitled.\n  I urge Senators to vote for the Cochran alternative. We have had a \ngood description of the content of the bill. It is going to be not only \napproved in conference but will be signed by the President and will get \nthe benefits to those who need it quickly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask the distinguished chair of the \nAgriculture Committee if it is his understanding that both amendments \nwill be up-or-down amendments as they are offered to the Senate.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. That is my understanding of the meaning of the agreement \nwe reached.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That is my understanding as well. I appreciate the \nclarification.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader has 3 minutes. The \nSenator from Mississippi has 1 minute 42 seconds.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, in the final 3 minutes, let me quickly \ncomment on a few points raised. First, to the point that we need to \ncomply with the House prior to the time we vote in the Senate, as the \ndistinguished Senator from North Dakota said, that is not usually the \npractice here. The Senate takes its stand, the House takes its stand, \nand we work out whatever differences there are in the two stands in \nconference. We don't say because the House has a position, we have to \ncomply with the House position before we even go to conference. I hope \nour colleagues will not set that very dangerous precedent as their \nmotivation for voting for the Republican amendment.\n  Secondly, we have gone through this many times. The formulation we \nhave used as a body, as a government, is the formulation offered in the \nDemocratic amendment. We give the administration latitude to administer \nit. We have created these programs, disaster assistance and crop \nassistance, for those relief benefits to be provided. That is what we \ndo here. It is the Republican amendment that creates a new \ninfrastructure, not the Democratic amendment. The traditional and \naccepted approach we have used in disaster after disaster is the one we \noffer again and the one for which we voted last fall and received 79 \nvotes.\n  Thirdly, what troubles me the most is that the Republican amendment \nis one-half of what is estimated to be the need. Even though it is one-\nhalf of the need, it is written in such a way that everybody, \nregardless of whether they have a loss, is eligible. So what happens is \nyou have situations such as the Senator from North Dakota described \nwhere those who are eligible, who may be entitled to a $45-per-acre \npayment, will get $6. Those who may not need any money at all will get \n$6. There are many of us who do our very best to maximize whatever \nvalue we get out of whatever dollars we commit in the programs we \nauthorize. I just don't see why that nondiscriminating approach is not \nwhat we want to do especially if you cut in half the benefits to begin \nwith. It seems to me you ought to maximize the benefits to those who \nneed them. There ought to be some degree of need demonstrated, which is \nwhy we say that 35-percent threshold has to be realized. To say you are \nentitled to benefits with no loss at a time when you are cutting the \noverall cost to the program by 50 percent turns logic on its head.\n  For those reasons, I hope my colleagues will do what they have done \nbefore. I hope they will support this amendment. I hope we can show the \nsame bipartisan support we did last fall, and I hope we can work out \nwhatever differences we have with the House in conference as we have \nalways done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Before I yield back the time remaining on this side of \nthe aisle, parliamentary inquiry: The schedule under the order is for a \nvote to occur at this time on the Cochran amendment and then, following \nthe vote on the Cochran amendment, a vote will occur on the Daschle \namendment; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The agreement was for the vote on the Cochran \namendment to be first, followed by the vote on the Daschle amendment.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I thank the Chair. I yield back the remainder of my \ntime, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, may I ask for the yeas and nays on both \namendments? I ask unanimous consent that that be in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Is there a sufficient second on both amendments?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 204.

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, for the information of Senators, we now \nhave an amendment to be offered by Senator Nelson of Florida. I am \ngoing to ask, in a minute, that we have a minute on each side to \nexplain this amendment. After that, Senator McCain has an amendment he \nwishes to debate. We believe we will be able to accept that amendment. \nSenators Durbin and DeWine have another amendment, and we believe we \nwill accept that one. Following that is the Specter amendment, which \nwill take an hour on each side. After that, we have other amendments \nthat are going to be offered. We are going to try to get an agreement \nin just a few minutes that the next vote will not be before 7:45, \nsomething like that.\n  Mr. REID. If I may ask my friend from Alaska, the manager of this \nbill, is there any way we could cut the time down on this 2 hours? We \nhave not had a 2-hour amendment in 2 days. I cannot understand why the \namendment would take 2 hours.\n  Mr. STEVENS. What amendment?\n  Mr. REID. Did I hear the Senator say the Specter amendment will be an \nhour on each side?\n  Mr. STEVENS. We do not have an agreement yet. We expect to have an \nagreement of 1 hour total, 30 minutes each side, but we do not have \nthat agreement yet.\n  Mr. REID. Fine.\n  Mr. STEVENS. But we do expect to get that agreement soon.\n  I would like to get an understanding that the next vote, after the \nNelson vote, will not occur before 7:45.\n  Mr. REID. I apologize to my friend. I was on the telephone.\n  Mr. STEVENS. That is so we can work this out and try to get an idea \nwhat we can do. Perhaps we can get the amendments so we can argue them \ntonight and vote on them tomorrow morning, but we will not know until \n7:45.\n  Mr. REID. I would say to my friend, we have done good work over here. \nWe have set an example for the majority. We have about eight or nine \namendments, and the folks over here have agreed to time limits. And 30 \nminutes is the longest we have on any of them.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I congratulate my friend. He has always done very good \nwork in this regard. The Senator from Nevada does a good job.\n  I want to announce that tomorrow morning I hope to be able to call up \namendments four or five at a time in a block that we have intended to \nagree to, but if people want to object, they can at that time. We will \nhave to pull them up and have a vote. But we think we have an agreement \non a whole series of amendments.\n  I would say potentially there are 70 amendments that are technical in \nlanguage and have de minimis amounts of money on small projects in \nStates that we can adopt in a process tomorrow morning on a consent \nbasis, if we can work that out. But tonight I hope to have, if we can \ndo it, at least a couple amendments argued so we can vote on them \neither tonight, after 7:45, or vote tomorrow morning.\n  Mr. REID. Will the distinguished manager yield for another comment?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. The reason I gave the Senator the outline of what we have \nbeen able to do is, we are going to try to stick to these times that we \nhave. But when you talk to your folks, have them understand that these \ntimes are contingent on your times also being agreeable.\n  Mr. STEVENS. It is a two-way street, Madam President. I agree 100 \npercent. We do intend to follow that procedure.\n  I would be happy to yield to my colleague from the South.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank my colleague from the North.\n  If I am correct, Madam President, we are trying to get some \namendments on the table. I would be happy to ask unanimous consent to \noffer my amendment following Senator Specter.\n  Mr. REID. At this time we cannot do that. I say to my friend from \nWashington, we have a schedule. I have already told Senators what the \norder would be.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The projection is the Specter amendment would be voted \non at 7:45.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 97\n\n  Madam President, I now ask unanimous consent that there be a period \nof 1 minute on each side so the distinguished Senator from Florida can \nexplain his amendment, and I will take the time on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, this is the African famine \nstarvation relief amendment.\n  Nearly two decades ago in Africa, my wife Grace held an almost \nlifeless,\n\n[[Page S1341]]\n\nstarving child in her arms, and that changed my wife's life forever. \nFor two decades she has been at the forefront of trying to get relief.\n  There was this famine 15, 17 years ago, and because of drought it is \nback. You have seen it. Everyone has seen it. The world has seen it: \nThe spindly legs, the distended bellies, the thatched hair, the begging \neyes.\n  The Senator from Alaska says he cannot accept this amendment because \nit is an emergency. It does not require the President to declare an \nemergency.\n  He says he will not accept any emergency amendments. If there is not \nan emergency, then I would ask, what is an emergency for America to \nshare its abundance?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in favor of the \namendment offered by Senator Nelson that would provide $600 million in \nemergency food aid to sub-Saharan Africa. I know other Senators are \nwaiting to speak so I will make three short points.\n  First, there is an enormous humanitarian crisis in sub-Saharan \nAfrica. The World Food Program estimates that there are 38 million now \nat risk of starvation. The situation has gone from bad to worse.\n  Second, humanitarian organizations with field operations in Africa, \nsuch as Catholic Relief Services and Save the Children, report that at \nleast $600 million is needed to address these immediate needs. What are \nthe reasons for this shortfall?\n  We are debating a budget request that is almost a year old. When the \nrequest was submitted last year, this crisis in Africa had not reached \nthis magnitude. On top of that, commodity prices have increased 30 \npercent.\n  Third, the Nelson amendment is carefully tailored to give the \nPresident the flexibility he needs to deal with the crisis. If the \nPresident does not want to spend this money, he does not have to \ndeclare an emergency. However, if he feels, as many of us do, that this \nmoney is needed now to address this growing crisis, he can declare it \nan emergency and provide this assistance to sub-Saharan Africa.\n  This is a bipartisan issue. I know Secretary Powell and Administrator \nNatsios care deeply about Africa. Representative Wolf just came back \nfrom Ethiopia and Eritrea and issued a compelling report on the dire \nsituation there.\n  The administration does not currently have the resources to deal with \nthis crisis. It is up to Congress to provide the resources to prevent \nmass starvation in Africa. We may not get another chance for months.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I regret deeply that I am faced with \nthis dilemma. There is $1.850 billion in Public Law 480 in the \namendment I have offered. That is $335 million above the 2002 level. \nThat money has not been allocated yet, and it is entirely available to \nallocate to the cause to which the Senator from Florida seeks to send \nrelief.\n  I understand his position, but we have already increased this amount \nin the bill. It is a sizable increase. I urge the Senate to realize \nthat and to support my motion to table.\n  Mr. President, I move to table the Senator's amendment, and I ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I announce that the Senator from Ohio (Mr. Voinovich) \nis necessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, this amendment arises out of the \nbankruptcy proceedings and reorganization of US Airways. It involves \nthe effort by US Airways, with the agreement of the pilots, to \nrestructure one of its pension plans. US Airways, as is well known, was \nvery hard hit, as was the airline industry generally, by the events of \nSeptember 11. US Airways was hit much harder because Reagan National \nAirport was closed down. In order to pare their expenses, the employees \nof US Airways made enormous concessions. The pilots made concessions of \nsome $650 million a year.\n  In order to obtain financing to get a Federal loan guarantee, there \nhad to be substantial modifications made. One of the proposals from US \nAirways was to restructure its pension plan so that instead of having a \n5-year payout, it would be a 30-year payout. This was agreed to by the \npilots, by the employees who are affected. And the Pension Benefit \nGuaranty Corporation, PBGC, made a determination that it did not have \nthe discretion to permit a plan termination and a reinstatement of the \nplan with a longer payout.\n\n  We had an extensive hearing in the subcommittee of the Appropriations \nCommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education last \nTuesday to inquire into this matter in some detail. It is my view that \nthe PBGC has substantial discretion, but in order to make a \nclarification, I filed this amendment.\n  Two weeks ago, Senator Santorum and I sought unanimous consent to \ntake up this legislation as a freestanding bill. I offer it on this \nomnibus appropriations bill because time is of the essence and all of \nUS Airways's reorganization proceedings have to be completed by March \n31, 2003.\n  I am well aware of the preference not to have this sort of matter on \nan appropriations bill, but we have no choice if we are to have this \nreorganization go forward.\n  Key testimony last Tuesday, a week ago yesterday, was given by an \nexpert attorney, William Kilberg, who had served as Solicitor to the \nDepartment of Labor in 1974 when the relevant statute was passed. Mr. \nKilberg, along with his affiliate Gary Ford, rendered an opinion that \nthe PBGC has the authority to allow for the plan modification, as I \nhave just articulated. The critical language of Mr. Kilberg's working \nopinion is as follows: The statute ``allows the PBGC to restore a plan \nwhen it is to be terminated or is in the process of termination.''\n  Then, referring to the decision of the Supreme Court of the United \nStates in the one case that interprets this matter, the LTV case, Mr. \nKilberg said ``the court said that a plan can be restored when \nrestoration would further the interest that Title IV of ERISA is \ndesigned to protect.'' He then enumerated the three points of the \nstatutory structure: that is, to keep premiums at a reasonable level; \nto keep plans going; and to have the plans pay benefits.\n  Now, if the proposal by US Airways, agreed to by the Air Line Pilots \nAssociation, is not permitted, then the PBGC will have to pay the \npensions. So it was in the financial interest of PBGC to have the plan \nadopted as US Airways and the pilots wanted.\n  Pilots who have worked for 30 years would be cut on their pensions by \nsome 20 to 25 percent, which would be a drastic curtailment, especially \ninequitable in the context of the pilots giving up some $650 million a \nyear.\n  When unanimous consent was asked 2 weeks ago, an objection was raised \nby the chairman and ranking member of the Finance Committee, and \nhearings were contemplated during the month of January. We went ahead \nwith hearings, as I said, from the subcommittee.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Clinton be added as an original \ncosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. So the essence of it is that this would be a win-win-win \nsituation. It would really be a win situation for the PBGC because it \nwould not have to pay the pensions. It would be a win situation for the \npilots since their pensions would not be reduced drastically, and they \nare the real parties of interest at risk. And it would be a win \nsituation for US Airways, which can structure its reorganization and \nthis way obtain financing and obtain the appropriate guarantee.\n  One point to be focused on with particularity is that this does not \norder the PBGC to adopt the US Airways proposal. All it does is say the \nPBGC has the authority to do so. The Secretary of Labor, who is the \ndominant public official in this matter, advised me that she felt bound \nby the opinion of the attorneys for the PBGC.\n  How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 18 minutes 30 seconds.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Madam President, will the Senator from Pennsylvania yield \nfor a series of questions?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I do.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Madam President, I ask the Senator from Pennsylvania, his \namendment as best I understand it--and this is for the benefit of other \nSenators to understand the purpose of the amendment--the Pension \nBenefit Guaranty Corporation, interpreted the law and felt that they \nhad not accorded what management and labor wanted in the restructuring \nof pensions, and the purpose of the amendment is, in a permissive \nmanner, to allow those directors to make that determination where right \nnow in their legal opinion they do not have that authority.\n  The point is, this is permissive as opposed to mandatory or dictating \nthat they must accept?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, the Senator from Virginia has \narticulated the situation accurately. It is permissive. They do not \nhave to adopt the plan. But the Secretary of Labor would then be in a \nposition to exercise her discretion, perhaps, if it was plain that the \nPBGC had the authority. It is permissible only.\n  I go into some detail with the background of the opinions that they \ndo have the authority because the whole statutory structure has been \nset up to keep these plans going, to have reasonable premiums, and to \nhave the plans pay benefits. What the PBGC has said is that it cannot \ndo it while everyone really agrees it ought to be done.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Madam President, I want to make it clear, the Senator \nstates that the pilots union, all labor, all management, are in \nagreement with this amendment to try to help save this airline and help \nsave those jobs and the service to the communities that are served by \nUS Airways; is that correct?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, that is correct. The leader of the \npilots association, the national president, testified Tuesday in favor \nof the plan and in favor of this legislation. The president of the \npilots association of US Airways in Pittsburgh testified in favor. The \npresident of US Airways, David Siegel, told me again today that he was \nvery appreciative of my pushing this matter, that it would be very \nhelpful to US Airways.\n  Mr. ALLEN. One final question. This applies only to this agreement \nthat has\n\n[[Page S1343]]\n\nto do with US Airways, labor and management. It should not have any \nimpact whatsoever on any other airline; is that correct?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, the Senator from Virginia is correct. \nIt has never been tailored to set a precedent or open any portals for \nany other situation in order to eliminate or obviate the argument that \nothers can rush in.\n  Madam President, when I pressed the general counsel and the executive \ndirector of the PBGC for any public policy reason not to do this, they \nhad no reason.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Kilberg's testimony be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 Excerpt of William Kilberg's Testimony\n\n       Senator Specter. Mr. Kilberg, you've heard the testimony of \n     Mr. Keightley. What is your analysis and conclusion of it?\n       Mr. Kilberg. I have a great deal of respect for Mr. \n     Keightley, but both Mr. Ford and I disagree with his opinion, \n     the restoration or the authority to restore a plan, as stated \n     in Section 4047. And while Mr. Ford was general counsel to \n     PBGC, I have had the honor of being solicitor of the \n     Department of Labor, and I was solicitor in 1974, when the \n     statute was passed and the initial restoration authority \n     language was put in.\n       It is very, very broad. It allows the PBGC to restore a \n     plan when it is to be terminated or is in the process of \n     termination. So a plan does not actually have to have been \n     terminated in order to have it restored.\n       The Supreme Court has had an opportunity to look at this \n     language in one case, the LTV case, the only instance where \n     there's been a plan restoration, and in that decision, the \n     court said that a plan can be restored when restoration would \n     further the interest that Title IV of ERISA is designed to \n     protect.\n       When we look at the interest as set forth in the statute, \n     the preamble to the statute, it is really just--just three. \n     It is to keep premiums at a reasonable level and to keep \n     plans going and paying benefits. And it was our conclusion \n     that, in this instance, a plan termination and a restoration \n     funding schedule which allowed a 30-year period of \n     amortization would do precisely that.\n       The PBGC and Mr. Keightley, in his opinion, says that \n     funding relief is not a proper purpose. I can't disagree with \n     that, but I would assert, respectfully, that it is a proper \n     method permitted by the statute in order to achieve the \n     statutory objectives of maintenance of plans and their \n     benefits and to keep PBGC premiums at a reasonable level.\n       That's basically the sum and substance of our disagreement. \n     There's relatively little case law. You will note that Mr. \n     Keightley's opinion doesn't cite any. There's just the LTV \n     decision. But we believe that that, combined with the \n     language of the statute and its purposes, would support the \n     argument that the PBGC has discretion to work out a \n     restoration funding schedule if it chose to do so with an \n     employer like U.S. Air that is in bankruptcy, where there is \n     no question but that a distress termination would be \n     appropriate, where it is able to fund those benefits over \n     time, and, frankly, where it has received unprecedented \n     concessions from its unions, giving up going-forward benefits \n     that make the ability to fund this plan over time a great \n     likelihood.\n       Senator Specter. Would you amplify your analysis of the one \n     decision by the Supreme Court of the United States on this \n     general area, which signifies to you the Supreme Court's \n     interpretation of legislative intent and the public policy in \n     this matter?\n       Mr. Kilberg. Well, in LTV it was LTV's decision to create a \n     follow-on plan which mirrored the plan that it had terminated \n     that caused the PBGC to first take the position that the \n     termination was a sham and then to insist that it could \n     restore the plan to LTV and create a new funding schedule.\n       That case was hotly litigated. It went to the Supreme \n     Court, and the Supreme Court interpreted the statute to give \n     the PBGC an extraordinarily broad grant of discretion, as I \n     indicated, to restore a plan when restoration would further \n     the interest that Title IV of ERISA is designed to protect.\n       The court went further and said that in carrying out this \n     specific and what it called an unambiguous statutory mandate, \n     the PBGC is not required to focus on the policies and goals \n     of other statutes. In other words, one of the arguments that \n     LTV was making was that because of the Internal Revenue code \n     and other statutes, the PBGC could not exercise its authority \n     to restore the plan and to impose a funding requirement upon \n     LTV. The court said that PBGC, in fact, has that very, very \n     broad authority.\n       Senator Specter. Mr. Keightley, would you care to comment \n     on Mr. Kilberg's testimony?\n       Mr. Keightley. First, I'd like to comment that the Supreme \n     Court, contrary to the trial court as well as the Court of \n     Appeals, deferred to the interpretation of the PBGC as to \n     what a statutory authority was in that particular case. And \n     that particular case was not at all analogous to the \n     situation. In that case, the LTV plans had been terminated in \n     order to avoid shut-down benefits. After that took place, the \n     unions and management agreed to, basically, pension plans \n     that made retirees, as I understand and read the opinions, \n     one-hundred percent whole and many of the others \n     substantially whole, with the PBGC paying the basic benefits, \n     and then they made up the rest in this, what we would call an \n     abusive follow-on plan. So they were letting us absorb their \n     pension cost; and, to the extent you view that as a labor \n     cost. That is completely--and the court said we had the \n     authority to construe the restoration authority in that \n     context.\n       In my view, that has no connection with the current \n     situation at all. I would say that they said we had broad \n     authority in interpreting our statute in order to come to \n     that result, but they deferred to our interpretation and \n     agreed with us. And, as I say, I just don't see taking that \n     language. There are limits to what I think we can do under \n     that statute, and I think you folks are, you know, U.S. Air \n     folks are asking us to go beyond that.\n       I might point out that there is no question that the \n     purpose, reading from the joint opinion, of the termination \n     restoration, is to provide funding relief for U.S. Airways \n     and pension plans. There's just no question about that. And \n     so, again, we think Congress addressed that issue, told \n     everybody who had that authority, limited the waivers. If you \n     remember the waivers in the IRS context are, you get to waive \n     it and spread the funding over, say, five years, I believe, \n     much shorter period of time.\n       So Congress has addressed that issue and built that limited \n     waiver provision into ERISA, and that's how I get to the \n     conclusion that PBGC does not have that statutory authority, \n     and other government agencies only have a very limited \n     statutory authority, which U.S. Air has advised us does not \n     meet their needs financially.\n       Senator Specter. While there's no doubt that the LTV case \n     is very different factually, your response doesn't really go \n     to the basic point that Mr. Kilberg made with respect to the \n     Supreme Court's determination that the PBGC has broad \n     authority and broad discretion to interpret the statute. Do \n     you disagree with Mr. Kilberg's statement as to the Supreme \n     Court's decision in that respect?\n       Mr. Keightley. We have broad authority within the statutory \n     limits.\n       Senator Specter. Well, do you think if you made a finding, \n     as Mr. Kilberg says you have the authority to do so, if that \n     was your decision within your broad discretion, that that \n     would be upheld by the Supreme Court?\n       Mr. Keightley. I do not believe--if the purpose was the \n     termination, to provide funding relief for U.S. Airways, I do \n     not believe the Supreme Court, or for that matter, any other \n     court, would uphold that position.\n       Mr. Kilberg. I do.\n       Senator Specter. Senator Santorum, anything further?\n       Mr. Keightley. One last point. I might point out that in \n     the bankruptcy proceedings in response to our opposition to \n     their termination restoration, they have abandoned that \n     position and are now pursuing legislative relief plus a \n     termination, and we intend to be working with them on some \n     other solution. But at this time, they're not pushing that, \n     and litigating it in the bankruptcy court is the point.\n       Mr. Kilberg. With all due respect to Mr. Keightley, no one \n     questions that the PBGC has discretion. The PBGC does not \n     have to agree to terminate a plan. The PBGC does not have to \n     agree to restore a plan. It certainly does not have to agree \n     to a particular restoration funding schedule if it does \n     decide to restore a plan. So this is all within the agency's \n     discretion, and we respect the agency's decision in this \n     regard. There's not much choice about it. We wouldn't have \n     standing to raise a complaint, bankruptcy court or anywhere \n     else.\n       Senator Santorum. Because what you would raise is they have \n     the discretion, so you certainly can litigate something where \n     you're saying they have discretion and then argue that you \n     abuse--I guess you could argue they abused the discretion.\n       Mr. Kilberg. Well, that would be a very difficult argument. \n     Certainly the PBGC has policy reasons. We may not agree with \n     them, but that doesn't mean that their use of discretion for \n     them to assert them.\n       Mr. Keightley. I continue to say we don't believe it is a \n     discretionary area when the sole purpose is altering the \n     funding. That's the purpose--that's the reason we're being \n     asked for this, and that is beyond our statutory \n     authority. There may be other areas where we have \n     discretion that is within that authority, but it doesn't \n     extend this far.\n       Senator Santorum. Do you agree that that's the purpose?\n       Mr. Kilberg. No. I mean, that's the method, obviously. And \n     I had the same point, Senator, that you had earlier, the \n     confusion between a restoration funding schedule and a waiver \n     of funding.\n       A waiver of funding is a term of art. It does go to the \n     Internal Revenue Service. There are very, very strict \n     limitations. They would not help U.S. Air in this instance. \n     They're really not for this purpose. What we're looking for, \n     clearly, is something far more creative, but something we \n     believe that, if it could be achieved, would help U.S. Air to \n     come out of bankruptcy and would serve the interest of its \n     employees as well as the company.\n       Mr. Keightley. May I read one sentence for the record from \n     the December 13th memorandum signed by Mr. Kilberg? ``The \n     purpose''----\n       Senator Specter. Where are you reading from?\n       Mr. Keightley. I'm reading from the December 13th memo of \n     Mr. Kilberg and Mr. Ford.\n\n[[Page S1344]]\n\n       Senator Specter. I understand that, but where from the \n     memo?\n       Mr. Keightley. Oh, in the first paragraph. ``The purpose of \n     the termination restoration''--I underscore ``purpose''--``is \n     to provide funding relief for U.S. Airways' pension plans.''\n       Senator Santorum. Mr. Kilberg?\n       Senator Specter. Well, there's no doubt about that, is \n     there?\n       Mr. Kilberg. There's no doubt, there is no doubt about \n     that, but that is our purpose. The question earlier was \n     ``purpose under the statute.'' They said that that was not a \n     purpose under the statute. When we use the term ``purpose,'' \n     we're using it as a method. That's the method that we \n     thought----\n       Senator Santorum. To accomplish what purpose under the \n     statute?\n       Mr. Kilberg. To accomplish a purpose under the statute that \n     would, from the PBGC's standpoint, that would maintain \n     premiums, and from the company employees' standpoint that \n     would restore the plan and would allow the employees to \n     obtain the benefits under the plan. Those are the statutory \n     purposes.\n       We used the term ``purpose'' here--we weren't talking about \n     statutory purpose; we were talking about our purpose.\n       Senator Santorum. Mr. Keightley, is the purpose, is the \n     method by which Mr. Kilberg has suggested U.S. Airways wants \n     to achieve its purposes proscribed by the statute?\n       Mr. Keightley. Yes, it's beyond our statutory authority, \n     whether it's a method or a purpose.\n       Senator Santorum. Is it proscribed by the statute . . .\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Anyone can examine the record. There was simply no \npublic policy reason given. When I talked about this to my colleagues, \nthe argument has been raised, well, it is complicated. Well, we have \nnot had hearings before the other committees. We had a very extensive \nhearing before the subcommittee on labor in the Appropriations \nCommittee. I say, this is win-win-win all the way around.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains on my side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator has 14 minutes 32 \nseconds.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I will yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Mississippi.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding this time.\n  I understand what the Senator from Pennsylvania is trying to do here, \nbut I am concerned that the Finance Committee has not had a chance to \nlook into this issue, the impact on the Pension Benefit Guaranty \nCorporation. Neither has the Commerce Committee. I am also concerned \nabout the precedent that is being set here.\n  It is a rifleshot for one company. The other companies would like to \nhave this same opportunity, perhaps. They are all involved in this \nPension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. It may be permissive, as was \npointed out, I believe, by the Senator from Virginia. But if this \ncompany, US Airways, does not make it in the end, as I understand it, \nthe other companies that pay into this benefit plan will be responsible \nfor covering the losses. Whether or not that is accurate, I am not \npositive what the impact would be. So that has been my concern, as I \nexpressed to the Senator earlier today.\n  It may have some merit. We may even want to look at setting this \nprecedent. But I don't think we have yet fully thought it through, and \nI am concerned we may be making a mistake here that could cause \ntremendous additional damage to the rest of the aviation industry.\n  I am going to be working with Senator McCain, Senator Hutchison, and \nSenator Rockefeller on this issue this year. We need to take a serious \nlook at aviation as a whole, not only the airlines but labor, \nobviously--their needs. How we deal with their pensions, what we do \nabout security, the costs they are faced with. It is going to take some \ntime to do this. To do this one rifleshot at this time, I would have to \nraise questions about it.\n  I would like to be able to work with the Senator from Pennsylvania \nbecause I know how committed he is to doing the right thing for the men \nand women who work for this company, but I express my reservation at \nthis time on this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, it is fine to talk about working this out \nthis year, but that will be too late, and the pilots will then have 25 \npercent of their pensions remaining. We talked to the Finance Committee \ntwo weeks ago about scheduling a hearing in January. No hearing has \nbeen scheduled for the Finance Committee during the month of January, \nas was anticipated. When the Senator from Mississippi makes a point \nthat the other airlines will have to pay the pensions of US Airways \npilots, that is precisely what is going to happen if this plan is not \nadopted. The PBGC is going to have to pay the pension benefits. So, at \nworst, if US Airways does not succeed, in any event, PBGC will be no \nworse off if this is adopted than if US Airways fails.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I have strong concerns about the very \nnarrow manner in which this provision is written. In general, I am not \nin favor of legislating in a way that deals with one specific company. \nFurthermore, as a member of the Senate Committee on Finance and the \nSenate Committee on Commerce, Science & Transportation, I regret that \nthis matter was not considered via the normal committee process. I hope \nthat we can have a broad discussion in the days ahead about ways to \naddress pension issues at struggling companies. Despite these concerns, \nhowever, I am supporting the amendment of the senior Senator from \nPennsylvania, particularly since this provision will place no \nadditional burden on the American taxpayer. I also support its goal of \nprotecting employees' pensions. Furthermore, this provision is \nimportant to US Airways' effort to secure a loan from the Air \nTransportation Stabilization Board. As a critical provider of air \nservice to West Virginia, I am committed to doing everything I can to \nensure US Airways' long-term viability.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield me 2 minutes?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I have the same concerns as articulated by the chairman \nof the Subcommittee on Aviation of the Commerce Committee, Senator \nLott. I know he and I would both be willing to look into this \nsituation.\n  We are in great sympathy for the entire airline industry. United \nAirlines is in bankruptcy. They have similar problems.\n  As far as this giving any leeway is concerned, it says right here:\n\n       . . . funding rules [for certain plans] shall apply for any \n     plan year beginning after December 31, 2002, in the case of a \n     defined benefit plan. . . .\n\n  Then it goes on to describe USAir.\n  Then later on it says:\n\n       . . . the minimum funding requirements under this paragraph \n     shall be the requirements. . . .\n\n  This is clearly a mandate. There is no flexibility in this. We all \nknow what ``shalls'' mean in appropriations bills.\n  I am in sympathy for the entire airline industry. That is why the \nfirst hearing we had in the Commerce Committee was on the status of the \nairline industry. CEOs of these industries came before us. They are in \nbad shape. They are in very bad shape. They are hemorrhaging hundreds \nof millions of dollars every year.\n  USAir is in bankruptcy. United is in bankruptcy. Others border on \nbankruptcy. This needs to be viewed in the context of the entire \nairline industry. As much sympathy as I have for USAir, I don't think \nwe can do something such as this at this particular time on an omnibus \nappropriations bill.\n  I want to commit to the Senator from Pennsylvania, I appreciate his \ndedication to the people of Pittsburgh and to the people who are \nemployed by USAir, and I look forward to working with him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield 5 minutes to my colleague from Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Specter \namendment. I understand, just listening to the Senator from Arizona, \nthat this is a complex issue and there are a lot of carriers involved \nin bankruptcies or financial distress. For this carrier timing is the \nissue. They have to file this complete reorganization by the end of \nMarch.\n\n[[Page S1345]]\n\n  We have a situation where hearings and study by the Commerce \nCommittee, Finance Committee, HELP Committee--whatever--are great for \nlooking at the overall picture of pensions and what we are going to do \nwith funding of distressed plans, but that doesn't solve the problem of \nUS Airways. US Airways went about solving their own problem, and they \ndid so by working in a very aggressive fashion with a labor union that \nis most involved, which is the pilots, and got enormous concessions. \nThey got enormous concessions from the pilots union, in this case, to \ndramatically reduce their pension benefits in order for the airline to \nsurvive.\n  This was actually a model of labor-management cooperation. They came \nto the administration believing--as Senator Specter has outlined, \njustifiably so--because their counsel, who is a former PBGC lawyer, \nsuggested they had the discretion to do so--they could get this plan \napproved. That is because it was a model of how to restructure a \npension plan to: No. 1, provide a reduction of expenses to allow the \ncompany to go forward and emerge from bankruptcy--and that is what this \nplan does; it reduces US Airways' expenses to allow them to emerge from \nbankruptcy; No. 2, provide the best possible compensation for a pilots \nunion, for pilots who obviously have very good benefits, but they were \nwilling to take a hit, but not as much as would be the case if the PBGC \ntook over the plan. So it was a good compromise; and, No. 3--and this \nis something our colleagues should be concerned about--it doesn't cost \nthe Federal Government any money. If the PBGC takes over the plan--if \nthe plan is terminated and the PBGC takes over this plan, it is a half \na billion dollars. That is what is going to be the cost if we don't \nagree to this amendment and don't give the administration the \nflexibility to adopt the US Airways-pilots union agreement.\n  So we have here a situation where we would be encouraging positive \ncooperation between labor and management; saving the Federal Government \nmoney; and, according to the provisions we enacted here after 9/11, \nwhere airlines effectively were eligible for these loan guarantees but \nwe wanted to be sure if these guarantees were given, the companies \nwould do the things necessary to run a good financial operation, US \nAirways has dramatically reduced their costs at the direction of the \nboard we set up to help stabilize the airlines.\n  So US Airways has done everything we would want a company to do: \nReduce costs to make them competitive; get agreements with their labor \nunions to reduce costs but at the same time not in a draconian way; and \nsave the Federal Government money. The administration has come back and \nsaid: That may be all well and good, but we don't have the authority to \ndo this and we just don't think it is good policy. But even if we did \nthink it was good policy, we don't have the authority to do it.\n  Fine. This amendment gives them the authority to do it. It doesn't \nforce them to do it.\n  So I say to my colleagues who suggest what we are doing here is \nopening Pandora's box by allowing other companies to come in under this \nUSAir exemption, all this does is give them the flexibility to deal \nwith this situation. It doesn't force them to adopt the US Airways \nproposal.\n  So I think this is a prudent step. It is in response to the PBGC \nsaying they do not have the authority. I am not sure--and I don't know \nwhether Senator Specter has commented on this--whether they would even \nexercise that authority if this amendment is agreed to. But what it \ndoes is it gives them the opportunity, or hopefully the incentive, to \nrelook at their decision based on the facts as to what would be in the \nbest interests of the fund, the people who actually contribute to the \npension system. So it is not taxpayers' dollars but it is employee \ncontributions.\n  So it would, in fact, be beneficial, I believe, saving money, \nencouraging labor-management cooperation, and encouraging companies, \nairlines in particular, to restructure in a way that is going to give \nthem the chance to be profitable over the long term.\n  That is a win-win-win for us. Hopefully, we will be successful in \nagreeing to Senator Specter's amendment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 8 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, in response to the arguments raised by \nthe Senator from Arizona, he points out the ``shalls'' in the pending \namendment. But each of the ``shalls'' relate to preexisting obligations \nunder which the PBGC can put this plan into effect. The two ``shalls'' \nin subsection (2)(A) say that ``the minimum funding requirements under \nthis paragraph shall be the requirements set forth in Treasury \nRegulation.'' So it establishes the funding in accordance with existing \nregulations. What it does not say is that the PBGC has to put the plan \ninto effect.\n  The later provision under (B)(i) says that ``the plan shall be \ntreated as having met the requirements of Treasury Regulation,'' and \nspecifies the technical compliance. But it does not in any way require \nthat the PBGC has to carry this plan forward.\n  Let me add as cosponsors Senators Warner, Allen, Dole, Clinton, and \nSenator Santorum, whom I believe I should have mentioned earlier as an \noriginal cosponsor to the bill.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute of my 2 minutes to the \nSenator from Montana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this is the same issue which the Senator \nfrom Arizona raised not too long ago. It has serious deficiencies: No. \n1, that it only applies, as I understand it, to one carrier and not to \nother carriers, which on its face raises many serious questions.\n  No. 2, I said to the Senator from Pennsylvania at that time, if I \nwere in the position to influence whether we would have hearings on \nthis subject in the near future, I would certainly do so. Time has \npassed. We have a new chairman of the Finance Committee. But I still \nhold the same view; namely, that we should have a good opportunity to \naddress this issue more broadly and more fairly and deal with other \nairlines that face, to some degree, the same issues; otherwise, this is \na single-shot amendment. It is unfair to other airlines. We should have \nmore time to consider the right way to deal with this issue.\n  I respectfully urge Senators not to adopt this amendment so we can \nmore appropriately deal with the matter at an appropriate time.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself the 1 minute remaining. \nAt the end of the time being used up, I will make a motion to table. I \nwill not do that yet.\n  But I want to reiterate what my colleague from Montana said; that \nthis is a problem bigger than USAir and requires the time of our \ncommittee to work on it. The statistic the distinguished chairman of \nthe Appropriations Committee gave me is that there are about 125 \ncompanies in one shape or another that are working in unison to try to \nfind a global solution. So taking care of the situation for US Airways \nought to be taken care of in conjunction with the issues that other \ncompanies have before the Congress instead of using a rifleshot. This \nis within the jurisdiction of the Senate Finance Committee. Nothing has \nbeen said about those left, but the chairman of the Senate \nAppropriations Committee is trying to write an appropriations bill that \nwould avoid the blue slip problem with the House of Representatives.\n  So this has a lot of problems. We have to deal with it in the \ncommittee.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, could I ask a question of Senator \nSpecter? Do we have time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Specter will have to yield time.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have a very simple question. If in \nfact this amendment is agreed to, and let us assume the next step is \nthat the board grants it--although you were saying that is optional, \nlet us assume it is granted--do the other airlines have a chance of \nlosing money as far as that fund is concerned now or in the future \nbecause of this incident?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Mexico for \nhis question. The answer is they do not have any chance of losing money \nunless you say the competitors of US Airways stay in flight. But that \nis very\n\n[[Page S1346]]\n\nmuch in the competitive interest of the United States.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I should have said other than they will retain a \ncompetitor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. They lose absolutely nothing.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. If you have to extend the program in terms of the \npayoff, does that mean it takes care of itself and that United Airlines \nmoney put into that plan takes care of that, not the other airlines? \nThe other airlines don't pay for it in any way?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, that is exactly correct. It is the money \nof US Airways paid over a longer period of time which meets the \nobligations to the pension. The other side of that coin is if the plan \nis not adopted, PBGC has to pay the pensions.\n  I yield 1 minute to my colleague from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Senator. I want to make a point, too, that \nthis is not a pension fund that has been underfunded for a long period \nof time. This isn't like a lot of the industries that have been in bad \nshape for years. I believe this pension fund is overfunded as recently \nas 2\\1/2\\ years ago. So this is not a chronically bad pension fund that \nall of a sudden is now coming into bankruptcy and asking for help. This \nis a fund that has been dramatically affected by two things: No. 1, \nobviously, September 11. One can make the argument that no other \nairline was affected more by 9/11 than US Airways. Why? Because they \nclosed the most profitable place they operate--Reagan National Airport. \nWho did that? The Federal Government. They closed their most profitable \ncenter at Reagan National Airport for an extended period of time--the \nplace that was the most effective with air travellers for US Airways. \nThat is where the traveling fell off most dramatically. That had a huge \nimpact on their ability to pay into their pension. No. 2, obviously the \ndecline in the market.\n  The ``perfect storm,'' if you will, hit US Airways and put them in a \nparticularly bad situation. And for them to come to the PBGC and say: \nLook, this is not a long-term problem, this is a problem that happened \nwhich is a very unusual event. Give us an opportunity to work ourselves \nout of the hole.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Would my colleague yield for a question? How much longer \nis he going to take?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I just wanted to know if the Senator from Pennsylvania \nagrees.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Take another minute.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I wanted to know if the Senator from Pennsylvania \nhappened to agree with my analysis.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Absolutely.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SPECTER. No. I don't have enough time, I regret to say. Let me \nmake a concluding argument. If time remains, I will yield for a \nquestion from the Senator from Montana.\n  We have heard this business of a single shot. That is what we do \naround here. We fire single shots. We have a problem, and we try to \nstructure legislation to answer the problem. We should fire single \nshots.\n  The most fascinating part about this argument today is that not one \npublic policy argument has been advanced against this proposition. \nNobody has said this is bad public policy. They have said that it is \nthe jurisdiction of the Finance Committee. Senator Santorum and I were \non this floor on January 9 asking unanimous consent to take up the \nbill, and the Senator from Montana, then the chairman, and the Senator \nfrom Iowa, then the ranking member now reversed, said we will try to \ngive you a hearing in January. No hearing has been scheduled. We went \nahead in the Appropriations Committee. We heard from the executive \ndirector of the PBGC and the general counsel. They had not one public \npolicy argument to advance against what we have said.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield on that very point \nabout the public policy argument?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Twenty seconds.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Will the Senator agree, strong public policy, which this \nbody has adopted, is that a company does not borrow from their pension \nfunds for their own corporate purposes? That is a strong public policy \npoint.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, has the time expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the business about borrowing from the \npension plan is a purple herring. It does not even rise to the level of \nbeing a red herring. Nobody has said anything about borrowing from the \npension plan.\n  Here we have an amendment which is a rifleshot to protect the \npensions of thousands of pilots. Otherwise, the PBGC is going to have \nto pay out money. This jurisdictional business does not have any \nstanding when the equities are so strong in favor of this amendment.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty seconds.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, in summation, I believe the arguments are \noverwhelmingly in favor of this amendment. I am joined by Senator \nSantorum, Senator Warner, Senator Allen, Senator Dole and Senator \nClinton.\n  A beneficial question was asked by Senator Domenici. We deal in \nrifleshots. We deal in protecting our constituents. And Pennsylvania \nhas a big constituent interest, but so does America. This is the \ncountry's sixth biggest airline.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I move to table this amendment and ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs. \nFeinstein), the Senator from Iowa (Mr. Harkin), the Senator from Hawaii \n(Mr. Inouye), the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry), and the \nSenator from Connecticut (Mr. Lieberman) are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 64, nays 31, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 18 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--64\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Conrad\n     Cornyn\n     Corzine\n     Craig\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dorgan\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham (FL)\n     Graham (SC)\n     Grassley\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hollings\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Johnson\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Lautenberg\n     Levin\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nickles\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Sessions\n     Smith\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--31\n\n     Allen\n     Biden\n     Boxer\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Clinton\n     Collins\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Gregg\n     Jeffords\n     Kennedy\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Lugar\n     Mikulski\n     Reed\n     Rockefeller\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Shelby\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--5\n\n     Feinstein\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Kerry\n     Lieberman\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nDurbin be allowed to call up an amendment which we will accept and then \nSenator McCain call up an amendment which we will accept. We are \nworking on a unanimous consent request and, if it is accepted, there \nwill be no more votes tonight. We have not quite gotten that straight \nyet. We cannot announce that yet. As soon as we get this unanimous \nconsent request adopted, we will be able to make that announcement.\n\n[[Page S1347]]\n\n  For the time being, does the Senator have a time limit on his \namendment?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Five minutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Five minutes on the Durbin amendment. How much time on \nthe McCain amendment?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Senator Kyl and I would both like 15 minutes, if that is \nagreeable.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Each?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Ten each.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Ten each.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Alaska, I note \nthe presence of my colleague, Senator DeWine, who would also like 5 \nminutes. A total of 10 minutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Fifteen minutes for Senator Durbin and Senator DeWine, \nand 20 minutes for Senator McCain and Senator Kyl--10 minutes each for \nSenator Kyl and Senator McCain. Is that agreeable?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. STEVENS. After which we will accept the amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. And that no amendments be in order to these amendments. \nI ask there be no amendments in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 127\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I express my gratitude to my colleague and \ncosponsor of this amendment, Senator DeWine from Ohio. It has been a \nbipartisan effort from the start, and we would not be at this \nsuccessful moment without him. I thank him from the bottom of my heart \nfor his dedication to this cause. I particularly thank the Senator from \nAlaska. He led the effort to fund the first effort to deal with the \nAIDS epidemic. I salute him for his leadership.\n  I call up amendment No. 127.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin], for himself, Mr. \n     DeWine, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Kennedy, Mrs. Boxer, Mrs. Murray, \n     Mr. Schumer, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Kohl, Mrs. Clinton, \n     Mr. Biden, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Edwards, Mr. \n     Lautenberg, Mr. Coleman, Ms. Collins, Mr. Brownback, Mr. \n     Smith, Mrs. Dole, Mr. Specter, and Ms. Snowe, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 127.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide an additional amount for funding global HIV/AIDS \n                               programs)\n\n       On page 311, between lines 7 and 8, insert the following:\n\n\n                 united states agency for international\n\n                              development\n\n                child survival and health programs fund\n\n             additional amount for global hiv/aids programs\n\n                     (including transfer of funds)\n\n       For an additional amount to carry out the provisions of \n     chapters 1 and 10 of part I of the Foreign Assistance Act of \n     1961, for child survival, health, and family planning/\n     reproductive health activities, $180,000,000, to remain \n     available until September 30, 2004: Provided, That of such \n     amount, not less than $100,000,000 shall be made available \n     for a United States contribution to the Global Fund to Fight \n     AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (in addition to amounts made \n     available for contribution to such Fund under any other \n     provision of this Act): Provided, further, That, of the \n     additional amount appropriated under this heading, up to \n     $25,000,000 (not to be derived from the amount made available \n     for contribution under the preceding proviso) may be \n     transferred to (and upon transfer shall be merged with) \n     amounts appropriated for the Department of Health and Human \n     Services for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n     for disease control, research, and training under title II of \n     division G of this Act, which shall be made available for \n     child survival, maternal health, and other disease programs \n     and development activities to prevent, treat, care for, and \n     address the impact and consequences of HIV/AIDS: Provided, \n     further, That not more than seven percent of the total amount \n     appropriated under this heading may be made available for \n     administrative costs of departments and agencies of the \n     United States that carry out programs for which funds are \n     appropriated under this heading, but funds made available for \n     such costs may not to be derived from amounts made available \n     for contribution and transfer under the preceding provisos.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following \nSenators be added as cosponsors of the amendment: Senators Clinton, \nBiden, Landrieu, Corzine, Edwards, Coleman, Collins, Brownback, Smith, \nDole, Specter, and Snowe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I will speak briefly to the substance of \nthis amendment.\n  This amendment adds $180 million to the U.S. effort to fight the \nglobal AIDS epidemic. I believe future generations will judge our work \nby many standards. One of the first tests of public service will be \nwhat we did to respond to the most devastating epidemic in history. The \nchallenge of global AIDS is a challenge to each and every one of us \nblessed with good health, a bountiful life, and a conscience. Today, \nwith this amendment, the United States will increase its spending on \nthe global AIDS crisis by 50 percent over last year's level. With these \ndollars, children will not be orphaned, communities will have hope, and \nwe will extend a hand to help the least of our brothers and sisters.\n  Now we turn to the world community and ask that they join us, \nincreasing their commitment with the United States to this struggle, \nshowing our mutual resolve to commit the resources, the energy, and the \nleadership to save a world at risk.\n  I am hoping that by the end of this week, Senator DeWine, Senator \nGraham of Florida, and a few others will be able to make a trip with me \nto visit Haiti. As far as my experience is concerned, it is the first \ntime--Senator DeWine has been there many times--to see that the AIDS \nepidemic is not across the ocean, it is in our backyard. It is in every \npart of this world. It threatens us from every direction. Once one has \nseen it face to face, they will never, ever be the same.\n  Two years ago, I went to Africa and saw it myself. I saw it in \nUganda, where I sat on a porch with mothers who were HIV positive, who \nwere gathering scrapbooks, photos, notes, and little memorabilia of \ntheir lives to leave to their children who were in the yard playing, \nchildren who had been orphaned already, losing one parent, and were \nabout to lose their second parent.\n  There are 42 million AIDS victims worldwide, most of them in sub-\nSaharan Africa. When one meets these victims, sees their courage, and \nsees what little it takes to fight this AIDS epidemic successfully, as \nthey have in Uganda and a few other countries, they realize that our \nleadership and our commitment at this moment in history can make such a \ndifference.\n  The United States has again shown leadership with this amendment. I \nthank Senator Stevens and my colleagues in the Senate for joining what \nI consider to be a historic moment. We have made a commitment on behalf \nof our country, which we hope others in the world will join, and in so \ndoing, I believe we can catch, and I hope apprehend, this epidemic \nbefore it is out of control, bringing peace and joy to the minds of \nmany who today are suffering around the world.\n  I thank my colleague Senator DeWine. It has been a genuine joy to \nwork with him on this. I thank him for his commitment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Dodd be added as a cosponsor of \nthis amendment as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague for adding me as a cosponsor. I \ncommend my colleague from Illinois for taking the leadership on this \neffort. I also commend our colleagues on both sides of the aisle for \nendorsing and supporting this proposal.\n  Over the last number of days, there have been rare occasions when we \nhave found some common ground. At this late hour on Wednesday night, it \nis refreshing to know that on this matter, and I think eventually on \nthe matter raised by Senator Nelson of Florida earlier, the issue of \nstarvation and hunger, we will eventually find some common ground as \nwell.\n  The leadership of Senator Durbin is something that ought to make all \nof us proud as Members of this body that the United States can step up \nto the forefront and try to do everything we possibly can to alleviate \nthe hardships\n\n[[Page S1348]]\n\ncaused by this scourge. I commend him for his efforts. I thank others \nwho have joined Senator Durbin as a cosponsor and thank Senator Stevens \nfor his willingness to accept this amendment and to endorse it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise in the support of Senator Durbin \nand Senator DeWine's amendment to increase U.S. support for the fight \nagainst the HIV/AIDS pandemic. As a 10-year member of the Senate \nSubcommittee on African Affairs--and over half of those years have been \nas either the ranking minority member or the chairman--I have seen the \nterrible unfolding of the pandemic. I have read and repeated the \nnumbing statistics that grow more horrifying every year. In 2002 alone, \n3.1 million people died of AIDS. Five million were infected with HIV \nover the course of the year, and 42 million people were living with the \nvirus by the end of the year. Ten million children have been orphaned \nby AIDS, and that number is expected to quadruple in the next 10 years. \nAnd I have seen the reality of these statistics in individual faces; I \nhave met with orphans, with the sick, with the dying, and with the \nmourning. And while most of my own experience with this disaster has \nbeen in the African context, this is not only an African problem. In \nIndia, China, Russia, and the countries of the Caribbean, the terrible \nstatistics have begun their own march steadily upward as the pandemic \nis taking hold.\n  The devastation is all the more appalling each year not just because \nthe numbers grow, but because each year we have more tools at our \ndisposal to fight this catastrophe. We know more about what works in \nterms of prevention and public awareness; we have improved treatment \nprotocols and developed more effective methods for stopping the \ntransmission of HIV from mother to child. But we still have not \ndeveloped the will to scale up our activities and to use these tools on \na grand scale.\n  The world simply must do more. Whole communities are being gutted--\nrobbed of their core of productive adults. Whole societies--whole \ncountries, even--are at risk. I urge my colleagues to consider the \nmagnitude of the crisis, consider the human tragedy involved, consider \nthe consequences of massive destabilization in the developing world, \nand to support this amendment. It is not going to solve the problem \nbefore us, but it is a step in the right direction, and we must take \nthese steps at our every opportunity.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I thank Senator Durbin for the great work \nhe has done. I thank Senator Dodd, Senator Coleman, and all of those \nwho have worked on this bill to bring us to this point. I also thank \nSenator Ted Stevens for raising the amount of money that this bill \noriginally had by $50 million, at our request. And then coming along, \nhe brought this bill to the floor and agreed to this amendment. I am \nvery grateful. He has been a leader in this area.\n  I also thank the majority leader, Bill Frist, who has great vision in \nthis area and great compassion as well. My colleague from Illinois has \nsaid it very well. When you travel to Africa or, as my wife Fran and I \nhave, to Haiti, when you see these children, when you hold them, touch \nthem, talk to the people who care for them, when you know these \nchildren whom you see or are holding in all likelihood many of them are \ngoing to die, it truly does change you forever. When you leave those \ncountries and when you leave those children, you know you cannot just \nleave. You know you have to try to do something. That is an experience \nI had, it was an experience my wife Fran had, but we are not unique. I \nknow my colleague Bill Frist has traveled to Africa. When he goes \nthere, he can do much more than I can. He can work as a medical doctor. \nI know Senator Inhofe goes, as well as many other people, and they see \nthis, and they come back. I have talked with so many of my colleagues.\n  This amendment says to the world that the United States of America \ndoes not just care, does not just want to use its rhetoric, but that we \nare going to back that up with our dollars and that we are going to do \nsomething about it and that, as the richest country in the world, we \nare going to lead in this area. We are going to be a leader in the \nworld.\n  In the last several years, we have done a lot better. My colleague \nhas said our spending level in this area has gone up significantly, and \nI compliment my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee for that. \nWith this amendment, we are upping that a lot more. It is $150 million \nmore. That money goes a long way. That money can be used primarily in \ntwo significant ways. One is to help in the area of the transmission \nfrom mothers who have AIDS to their babies. It is an amazing statistic. \nWe know, medical science tells us and the experts tell us, if we can \nreach these mothers early enough, before they give birth to that child \nwho will have AIDS because the mom has AIDS, and get medical treatment \nto her and get the proper drugs to her that really cost comparatively \nlittle, we can save that child.\n  Two out of three of the children who will be born, if the mother gets \nthe appropriate drugs, will not have AIDS. Think of the savings in \ndollars and cents, let alone the human savings. We can do that. Yet \nchildren are being born every single day with AIDS who needlessly would \nnot have to have AIDS.\n  With the great plagues in Africa today and the great plagues in Haiti \ntoday, there are a number of children who are orphans. All throughout \nthis little country of Haiti, there are thousands of orphans. Why? \nBecause there are not the drugs to keep the parents alive. And that is \ntransforming that little country of Haiti. For the next year, there \nwill be just as many incidents of AIDS in Haiti, a country of 8 million \npeople, as there will be in the entire United States of America. We can \nsee this is a problem not just in sub-Saharan Africa, it is a problem \nin a country that is only a 1-hour flight from Miami.\n  So this bill goes a long way to deal with this problem. It speaks \nvolumes. It says we care and we are going to put our money where our \nmouth is. It is a step forward.\n  It does not do everything, we have a long way to go, but I think it \nis a great bipartisan effort. I thank all of my colleagues for getting \nbehind this. I thank Senator Stevens for accepting the amendment. I \nagain pay tribute to Senator Durbin, who has been a real bulldog on \nthis. I thank all of my colleagues who have really made a great \ncommitment to it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I support this amendment and I congratulate \nmy friend from Illinois, Senator Durbin. He has been a passionate, \nrelentless advocate for increased funding to fight the horrific scourge \nof AIDS.\n  The foreign operations portion of this omnibus appropriations bill \ncontains $791 million for international programs to fight AIDS. That is \na lot of money, and I applaud Senator McConnell, the chairman of the \nForeign Operations Subcommittee, for including those funds, which is \nsimilar to the amount that was reported by the Appropriations Committee \nlast July.\n  It is a lot more than we were spending to combat AIDS just 2 or 3 \nyears ago. But think about it another way. The amount we expect to \nprovide in 2003 on AIDS, which threatens the lives of each of the \nworld's 6 billion people--is less than what my own State of Vermont, \nwith a population of only 600,000 people, will spend on health care \nduring that same period.\n  So while the United States is doing more than ever, and we can point \nto successes in several countries such as Uganda, Thailand, and Brazil, \nthe reality is that the AIDS pandemic is out of control.\n  It is spreading faster, not slower. Forty million people are \ninfected. Almost nobody is receiving treatment. Twenty five million \npeople have died from AIDS-related causes, and at the current rate that \nnumber is expected to exceed 65 million by the year 2020.\n  The reality is that despite everything we have done and are doing, we \nare failing miserably to control this pandemic. Until we develop a \nstrategy that\n\n[[Page S1349]]\n\nmatches the challenge, and until we start thinking in terms of \nbillions, not millions, of dollars, we will continue to fail.\n  The alternative is unthinkable, but it is by no means far-fetched. \n100 million deaths, 200 million, 400 million, this virus spreads \nexponentially and so does the cost of controlling it.\n  Imagine waking up tomorrow morning and learning that every single \nman, woman, and child--every single person--in Miami, Minneapolis, \nAtlanta, Denver, Boston, Seattle, Washington, DC, New York City, Los \nAngeles, Chicago, Houston, Philadelphia, San Diego, Detroit, and Dallas \ncombined had a virus for which there was no cure.\n  That is the reality in Africa today. Every hour--hour, not day, not \nweek not month, every hour--AIDS buries another 250 Africans.\n  Within the next decade, at the current rate, more than 40 million \nchildren in Africa will lose one or both parents to AIDS.\n  Many of these children will end up on the streets, turning to crime, \ndrugs or prostitution, driving the rates of HIV even higher, \nperpetuating this vicious cycle.\n  This is an enormous challenge for Africa, but it is an even greater \nchallenge for the world.\n  Every day, another 12,000 people are infected and millions more \ncontinue to suffer needlessly.\n  In India,the infection rate is skyrocketing. In China, only 4 percent \nof the Chinese population even knows how AIDS is spread.\n  It is a grim picture, but there is a great deal we can do. We do not \nhave a cure for AIDS and there is no vaccine in sight, but we know how \nto protect ourselves from the HIV virus. We can provide basic care to \nthe sick, and mobilize communities to support the growing number of \nAIDS orphans.\n\n  We know how, for pennies a day, to treat the half of all AIDS \npatients who will otherwise die from the pneumonia, tuberculosis, or \nmeningitis that prey upon weak immune systems. We have to get these \ndrugs, as well as antiretroviral drugs which have been available in \nwealthy countries for years, to people in poor countries that need \nthem.\n  We know how to reduce the transmission of AIDS from mothers to \nchildren. We must also care for the mothers who are sick, because a \nyoung child without a mother in these countries cannot survive.\n  We know all these things but, even so, we are failing. The disease is \nspreading out of control. What we lack, even after all these years, is \na global plan.\n  This administration, as the one before it and the one before that, \nhas no plan for how to mount a global campaign to combat the most \ndeadly virus in history. There is no strategy for dealing with 40 \nmillion AIDS orphans, no strategy for getting treatment to the 40 \nmillion people infected today, or the 50 million who will be infected \nin another 3 years, no strategy for expanding education and prevention \nprograms on the scale that is called for.\n  It is not enough to point to a few success stories, as important as \nthey are. You have to look at the big picture. Despite everything we \nhave done and are doing, we have failed miserably. This deadly pandemic \nis out of control, and the amount of money being spent is a pittance of \nwhat is needed.\n  If we are going to conquer--or at least control--this disease, we \nneed to think differently about it. It sounds cliche and it has \nprobably been said many times before, but we need the health equivalent \nof the Manhattan Project or putting a man on the moon. We need to \nincrease our investment not linearly but exponentially. Where we are \nspending millions we need to spend billions.\n  Unless we start treating AIDS as a global health catastrophe, not \njust someone else's problem, we will face a far worse, and far more \ncostly, crisis in the future.\n  The world faces immense challenges--from global warming to the threat \nof nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, to poverty on a vast \nscale. We cannot ignore any of challenges because they all affect the \nsecurity of future generations of Americans.\n  But when those same future generations look back at this time and \nplace, I believe they will judge us, more than anything, on how we \nresponded to AIDS. It is the most urgent, the most compelling, moral \nissue of our time.\n  This amendment is a step, and an important one. I urge President \nBush, who has shown real leadership in focusing our country and the \nworld on combating terrorism, to think differently about AIDS. As \nserious a threat as international terrorism is, and we are spending \nmany billions of dollars to protect ourselves from terrorists, measured \nby the number of victims it pales compared to AIDS.\n  Last year, the White House opposed an earlier amendment by Senator \nDurbin, to provide $500 million in emergency funding to combat AIDS. \nBecause of the White House's objection, that amendment was defeated. I \nhope we do not repeat that mistake today because if AIDS is not an \nemergency, nothing is.\n  To those who would say we cannot afford the additional $180 million \nprovided in this amendment, I say look at the past decade. Look at the \npast two decades. If we had only acted then. We could have saved tens \nof millions of lives and billions of dollars. Instead, there was \nmonumental failure of leadership, and today we are facing costs that \nwere unthinkable then.\n  Have we learned nothing? I hope we have. Let us pass this amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I join in support of the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Illinois, Senator Durbin, and by the \nSenator from Ohio, Senator DeWine, to provide urgently needed help in \nthe international battle against AIDS, TB, and malaria.\n  AIDS killed 3 million people last year, TB almost 2 million, and \nmalaria killed more than 1 million, mostly children in Africa. These \nterrible diseases end lives, destroy families, undermine economies, and \nthreaten the stability and progress of entire nations.\n  AIDS, TB, and malaria rob poor countries of the workers they need to \ndevelop their economies. They lose teachers needed to combat illiteracy \nand train their workers for modern challenges. Africa has lost 7 \nmillion farmers needed to meet the food needs of entire nations. These \ndiseases plunge poor nations into even deeper, more desperate poverty.\n  We must carry the fight against AIDS, TB, and malaria to every corner \nof the globe. And the Durbin-DeWine amendment would help the United \nStates and the world to meet this extraordinary challenge.\n  While we still seek a cure to AIDS, we have learned to help those \ninfected by the virus to lead long and productive lives through the \nmiracle of prescription drugs.\n  But this disease knows no boundaries. It travels across borders to \ninfect innocent people in every continent across the globe.\n  We have an obligation to continue the fight against this disease at \nhome. But we should also share what we have learned to help those in \nother countries in this life-and-death battle. And we must do all we \ncan to provide new resources to help those who cannot afford today's \ntherapies.\n  As we sought to enforce child labor laws at home, we also worked to \nprotect children abroad. As we developed new ways of promoting \nchildren's health and public health, we have shared these lifesaving \ndiscoveries with other countries in need.\n  And once again, we are called upon to open the doors between nations \nto do all we can to halt the spread of AIDS, TB, and malaria, and to \ntreat those infected by these deadly diseases.\n  Twelve years ago, this country demonstrated its commitment to the \ncare and treatment of Americans living with AIDS by passing the Ryan \nWhite Care Act. Since that time, community-based care has become more \navailable, drug treatments have been developed that nearly double the \nlife expectancy of HIV positive individuals, and public campaigns have \nincreased awareness of the disease. Yet, advances such as these remain \nlargely the privilege of wealthy nations.\n  AIDS inflicts a particular toll on developing countries. Globally, 40 \nmillion people have HIV/AIDS, and the overwhelming majority live in \npoor countries. Sub-Saharan Africa is the most affected region, where \nnearly all of the world's AIDS orphans live.\n  Governments can make the difference in battling this epidemic.\n\n[[Page S1350]]\n\nWhere governments in poor countries have been provided resources to \nfight the spread of AIDS, infection rates have dropped 80 percent. But \nthese countries cannot turn the corner on AIDS on their own. Their \ngovernments must be provided the technical assistance and resources to \ncarry out anti-AIDS campaigns. They need financial help to afford \nexpensive antretroviral drugs. And drug companies must do their part to \nmake these drugs more affordable to the poor.\n  The challenges are great, but not insurmountable. The epidemic is in \nits early stages. In most regions of the world, the prevalence rate is \nstill less than 1 percent of the population. But we cannot delay. It \nonly took 10 years for the HIV/AIDS population to double in the Russian \nFederation. And in South Africa, the rate increased from 1 in 100 \npeople to 1 in 4 in one decade.\n  The Durbin-DeWine amendment would help the United States and the \nworld to meet the extraordinary challenges of AIDS, TB, and malaria. By \nsupporting this amendment to increase the funding for bilateral AIDS \nprevention, care and treatment, as well as the United States commitment \nto the Global Fund, we will be helping to address the global public \nhealth crisis and maintain international stability.\n  I thank Senator Durbin and Senator DeWine for offering the amendment, \nand I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield 2 minutes to my colleague from Minnesota. I \nprecede this by saying I was particularly touched by his decision to \nadd his name as a cosponsor of this amendment. He is new in the Senate. \nI do not know him well. But he has made a fabulous first impression on \nme that he would stand up so early in his Senate career for such an \nimportant issue.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the new Senator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from \nIllinois for yielding the floor and giving me this opportunity.\n  Two weeks ago yesterday, I was sworn in as a Senator. This is the \nvery first amendment I signed onto. I appreciate this opportunity.\n  All too often, we talk about all politics being local, but there is a \nglobal aspect. We are touched by what happens around the world. The \nJewish philosopher Maimonides said we each should view ourselves as if \nthe world were held in balance and any single act of goodness on our \npart can tip the scales.\n  The reality is the impact of this amendment will tip the scales again \nand again and again and it will change the world.\n  As my colleague from Ohio discussed, we reach one mother, we save one \nchild. I believe this is a national security issue. If we do not deal \nwith the plague and the plight of AIDS, it will have a tremendous \nimpact upon our security here.\n  I believe this is a humanitarian issue. We are doing the right thing.\n  I thank my colleague from Illinois for his leadership in helping me \nbe part of doing what is right.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I conclude briefly by saying there are \nmany people in this world who do not understand the United States of \nAmerica. There are many people in this world who hate the United States \nof America. They do not understand who we are. They do not understand \nour values.\n  Tonight, the Senate, with this small effort, is trying to say to the \nworld that we care, we are part of this global community that wants to \nmake this a better Earth, better for everyone to live on. I hope that \nsome who judge us will judge us by what we have done tonight.\n  I express my gratitude to all the Senators who have joined me in this \neffort, particularly Senator DeWine, in passing this important \namendment. I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If all time is yielded back, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment of the Senator from Illinois.\n  The amendment (No. 127) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Could I ask the regular order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The Senator is to be recognized \nto offer an amendment.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 54\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. On behalf of Senator Kennedy, Senator Kyl, Senator \nFeinstein, and myself, I believe there is an amendment at the desk, and \nI ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], for Mr. Kyl, for \n     himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. McCain, and Mr. \n     Feingold, proposes an amendment numbered 54.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n      (Purpose: To make funds available for the Entry Exit System)\n\n       On page 95, line 7, strike ``$3,076,509,000'' and insert \n     the following: ``$3,241,787,000: Provided, That of the amount \n     appropriated under this heading $80,200,000 shall be \n     available only for the Entry Exit System, to be managed by \n     the Justice Management Division: Provided further, That, of \n     the amounts made available in the preceding proviso, \n     $42,400,000 shall only be available for planning, program \n     support, environmental analysis and mitigation, real estate \n     acquisition, design and construction: Provided further, That \n     $25,500,000 shall only be available for an entry-exit system \n     pilot, including demonstration projects on the southern and \n     northern border, and $12,300,000 shall only be available for \n     system development: Provided further, That none of the funds \n     appropriated in this Act, or in Public Law 107-117, for the \n     Immigration and Naturalization Service's Entry Exit System \n     may be obligated until the INS submits a plan for expenditure \n     that: (1) meets the capital planning and investment control \n     review requirements established by the Office of Management \n     and Budget, including OMB Circular A-11, part 3; (2) complies \n     with the acquisition rules, requirements, guidelines, and \n     systems acquisition management practices of the Federal \n     Government; (3) is reviewed by the General Accounting Office; \n     and (4) has been approved by the Committees on \n     Appropriations: Provided further, That funds provided under \n     this heading shall only be available for obligation and \n     expenditure in accordance with the procedures applicable to \n     reprogramming notifications set forth in section 605 of \n     Public Law 107-77: Provided further, That none of the funds \n     made available by this Act shall be available for any \n     expenses relating to the National Security Entry-Exit \n     Registration System (NSEERS), and that the Attorney General \n     shall provide to the Committee on Appropriations all \n     documents and materials: (1) used in the creation of the \n     NSEERS program, including any predecessor programs; (2) \n     assessing the effectiveness of the NSEERS program as a tool \n     to enhance national security; (3) used to determine the scope \n     of the NSEERS program, including countries selected for the \n     program, and the gender, age, and immigration status of the \n     persons required to register under the program; (4) regarding \n     future plans to expand the NSEERS program to additional \n     countries, age groups, women, and persons holding other \n     immigration statuses not already covered; (5) explaining of \n     whether the Department of Justice consulted with other \n     federal agencies in the development of the NSEERS programs, \n     and if so, all documents and materials relating to those \n     consultations; (6) concerning policy directives or guidance \n     issued to officials about implementation of NSEERS, including \n     the role of the FBI in conducting national security \n     background checks of registrants; (7) explaining why certain \n     INS District Offices detained persons with pending status-\n     adjustment applications; and (8) explaining how information \n     gathered during interviews of registrants will be stored, \n     used, or transmitted to other Federal, State, or local \n     agencies.''.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I join my friend, Senator Kyl, and thank \nhim, Senator Kennedy, Senator Feinstein, and Senator Feingold. I also \nthank Senator Stevens for his agreement to this amendment which we \nthink is a very important amendment.\n  I understand that under the previous order, I have 10 minutes and the \nother Senator from Arizona has 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this amendment restores $165 million, \nwhich was the level of funding requested by the President, to the INS \nfor development and implementation of the exit-entry systems to be used \nat ports of entry across the United States.\n  Before any of my colleagues might have an impression that somehow I \nam breaking some of my iron rules, the fact is this amount of money was \nrequested by the President in the President's budget, so what Senator \nKyl and\n\n[[Page S1351]]\n\nI are achieving here is the restoration of at least some of those funds \nfor this very important program.\n  This morning, on the front page of the Wall Street Journal:\n\n       A Ranger's Death Shows New Hazards Of a Venerable Job. Law \n     Enforcement Has Become A Bigger Part of Duties; Some Bridle \n     at the Change. A Gunfight on the Border.\n       Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, Ariz.\n       In the ovenlike afternoon heat last Aug. 9, Kris Eggle got \n     a call for help.\n       Mexican police were chasing a truck that was about to cross \n     the poorly marked national border into this desert park. Mr. \n     Eggle, a 28-year-old park ranger, raced to the scene and \n     found the truck stuck in a dust-filled pothole on the U.S. \n     side. Several men spilled out and ran.\n       Mr. Eggle spotted one of them trying to hide behind a bush. \n     He approached the suspect and prepared to arrest him, when \n     the man whipped out an AK-47 automatic rifle and fired.\n\n  Mr. Eggle, a dedicated member of the U.S. Park Service, was killed in \nthat encounter. He is the fourth park ranger to be killed in recent \ntimes as we are experiencing an increasing level of violence on our \nsouthern border.\n  We are in a crisis on our southern border--not just Arizona, but \nArizona, unfortunately, is experiencing a majority of these problems \nbecause there have been crackdowns in California and in Texas, which \nhas then funneled people up through Arizona.\n  This is a tragedy--a tragedy. Last year, 320 illegal immigrants died \nin the desert of Arizona trying to get across, usually exploited by \nunscrupulous coyotes, as they are called, who brought them across the \nborder and said, ``Tucson is right over the next hill,'' and left them \nto die in the desert of Arizona.\n  By the way, the motivation of those who died, I am sure, was simply \nto get a job so they could feed their families. The ones with the drug \nsmugglers and the coyotes and the bad people, they don't starve in the \ndesert because they know how to survive and they know where to go. \nInnocent people are dying every day in the deserts of Arizona and \nacross this Nation. These innocent people, very frankly, are coming \nhere because they want a better life in the United States. That is the \nsame reason my ancestors came here and any of us who are not Native \nAmericans.\n  There is a crisis in health care in Arizona. Emergency rooms are \nbeing shut down. Over $100 million in medical expenses was incurred by \nthe State of Arizona last year because of medical services paid for by \nillegal immigrants. Senator Kyl will talk about the fact that it is the \nINS people who are waving medical emergencies across the border. That \nis a Federal responsibility. It is not a State responsibility. It is a \nFederal responsibility. Enforcement of our border is a Federal \nresponsibility.\n\n  Do you know what else is happening? An interesting and very alarming \nthing is happening. People, believing--correctly--that the Federal \nGovernment won't take care of its responsibilities, are beginning to \nwant to take these responsibilities in their own hands in the form of \nvigilantism.\n  The Arizona Daily Star, January 3, 2003:\n\n       Bisbee militia leader Chris Simcox says he is set today to \n     launch the first patrols along the border with members of his \n     Civil Homeland Defense group.\n       Simcox has said he plans to have groups of armed citizens \n     patrolling three areas of the Arizona-Mexico line, though he \n     wouldn't specify the sites.\n\n  Do you know what vigilantism leads to, Mr. President? There is no \ndoubt what it leads to; that is the death of innocent people. Our \nborder is uncontrolled. If we are going to win a war on terrorism, how \ndo we know who those 1,000 people a day are? A thousand people a day \nwho are coming across the Arizona border into our country are not just \npeople who are seeking a job, not even just drug smugglers, but could \nbe terrorists, as well.\n  This amendment is attacking a small part of a major problem that we \nhave in this Nation. I don't think it is a parochial attitude toward my \nown State when the facts are that three out of every five illegal \naliens who are coming into the United States of America are apprehended \nin the State of Arizona. There are miles and miles and miles of border. \nWhat separates the United States of America from Mexico is seven \nstrands of barbed wire. The latest tactic--I don't mean to take too \nmuch of my colleagues' time--is to take an SUV, put something in front \nof it, and bust right through the barbed-wire fence and bring in the \ndrugs and bring in the illegals and everybody else who wants to get in. \nSenator Kyl went down and talked to a rancher--11 times in 1 week SUVs \nhave driven right across his property, a couple of them armed. Our \ncitizens deserve better than that; those who live along the border, \nthose who run health care facilities along the border, deserve better \nthan that and certainly the citizens of this country deserve a better \nenforcement of our national borders than they are receiving today.\n\n  I say in closing that Senator Kyl and I, along with other border \nState Senators, intend to make this an issue this year because it has \nto be addressed. It has to be addressed.\n  If we are going to preserve the security of this Nation, we have to \nhave protection of our borders. It may cost money. It may be a \ndifficult task to achieve. But the consequences of a failure to act are \nunacceptable.\n  I yield the remainder of my time and again I thank Senator Stevens \nfor helping us with this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we are prepared to accept the amendment, \nand I ask it be adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is time remaining.\n  Mr. KYL. I would like to speak on it as well.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am sorry, I thought the Senator had already spoken. I \nwithhold my motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me take a couple of minutes to amplify a \ncouple of points my colleague, Senator McCain, made and also I ask \nunanimous consent Senator Domenici of New Mexico be added as a \ncosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, as Senator McCain just noted, we have a \ncrisis on the southern border with Mexico. We have drug and human \nsmuggling daily. There are over 500,000 illegal immigrants a year \ncrossing into the United States; 320 people died last year crossing \ninto the desert area of Arizona. There is a significant degradation of \nthe environment that has occurred because of the large number of people \nand vehicles coming across. The ranchers' operations are disrupted, \ntheir cattle are sent scurrying, their fences are cut, their water is \ntaken. We have hundreds of millions of dollars of medical costs that \nare unreimbursed because of the emergency care that is being provided \nto illegal immigrants. We have the vigilantes that Senator McCain \ntalked about springing up now, an understandable reaction to a problem \nbut not an appropriate one. We have attacks on the Border Patrol every \nday, and even park rangers are being killed.\n  This is a crisis and it has to be dealt with. I thank Senator Stevens \nand the other Senators who were helpful, for helping us to restore some \nof the funding the President had requested, and for their willingness \nto accept this amendment to begin to deal with at least one aspect of \nthis problem.\n  We have not only, however, a problem of controlling the border at the \nborder, but we also have a problem of dealing with the people who come \nto the United States legally but stay here illegally. That is one of \nthe specific focuses of this amendment. I would like to take just a \nsecond to talk about it.\n  Did you know that half of the approximately 10 million people who are \nhere in the United States illegally today came here legally and they \noverstayed their visas? The problem is, we don't have an effective \nsystem in our country that can track the people who are here illegally. \nWe have mandated it three times in the law now. It is called an Entry \nExit System. One of the things this amendment will do is to restore \nabout $80 million to help fund this Entry Exit System.\n  This was originally left out of the Senate version of the bill, but \nas I said, thanks to the work of Senator Gregg and Senator Hollings, \nSenator Byrd and Senator Stevens, we were able to get this funding back \ninto the bill.\n  The Entry Exit System was originally authorized in 1996 through the \nIllegal Immigrant and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, and then it \nwas\n\n[[Page S1352]]\n\nstrengthened again in the U.S.A. Patriot Act after September 11, and \nagain in the Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act. In all three \ncases we need to basically mandate the Federal Government to institute \nand administer this program.\n  Finally, Congress has gotten the attention of the appropriate \nofficials, and we are beginning to get this done. It makes no sense to \nspend all of the resources we spend to control the border and then \ntotally ignore the fact that half of the people who are here illegally \ngot here legally, but we have no way of tracking them and determining \nwhere they are at a given time.\n  There are a lot of reasons this is important, but just think about \nthe terrorism aspect for just a moment. This will help us identify \nterrorists, someone who arrived on a valid visa but hasn't exited the \ncountry because they want to stay here and engage in some nefarious \nactivity. Just imagine if we had an effective system working at the \ntime the September 11 hijackers came here. All of them came legally but \nof course they weren't all remaining in the country legally after they \narrived.\n  It will also obviously help in a lot of other ways. As a matter of \nfact, when someone exits the country, if our law enforcement officials \nneed to question them for any reason, they can be stopped and therefore \nthey can be questioned because of the effectiveness of this system.\n  I want to make a final comment for the benefit of the administration \nbecause Congress is now acting to begin the funding of this program.\n  Senator Gregg, the chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee, has \nmade the point in the past it always has not been a wise expenditure of \nmoney by Congress to fund INS systems because the money doesn't seem to \nbe spent very wisely. What we are saying is, as a result of this \namendment, we are willing to put confidence in the INS, in the new \nHomeland Security Department, Justice Department, Border Patrol, and \nthe other agencies that have this responsibility. But we expect them to \nfollow through on the laws that we pass so when we mandate a system, it \nis implemented, and we expect it to be implemented on time.\n  We are going to be restoring the funding so they can do that. We \nexpect them to do their part of the job and put these systems into \neffect. Not only is it important to help us with the problems of \nillegal drug smuggling and illegal immigration and general crime \ncontrol, but it is now very important to deal with the problem of \nterrorism and the terrorist threat to our country.\n  I thank Senators Stevens, Gregg, and Hollings. I thank the cosponsors \nof this legislation. I am very much looking forward to working with \nthem on the problems that Senator McCain and I have identified in many \nother areas that we are going to have to deal with this year to deal \nwith this crisis situation on the border between the United States and \nMexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is all time yielded back? The Senator from \nAlaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I urge the adoption of the amendment \noffered by the Senators from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back. The question is on \nagreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 54) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 80, As Modified\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, is amendment No. 80 pending?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, it is.\n  Mr. REID. On behalf of Senator Dayton, I ask unanimous consent the \nDayton amendment be modified with the changes that are now at desk, the \namendment as modified be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid on \nthe table, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. STEVENS. No. I thank the Senator from Nevada for his great work \non this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 80), as modified, was agreed to, as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-\n296) to provide that waivers of certain prohibitions on contracts with \n corporate expatriates shall apply only if the waiver is essential to \n             the national security, and for other purposes)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC ____.

The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will yield? The Senator from Connecticut \nwishes to make a short statement. We have a unanimous consent agreement \nwe wish to enter into.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes. I have a unanimous consent request to offer as soon \nas the Senator from Connecticut is finished.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. I believe the unanimous consent request needs to be made to \nwithdraw both the Dodd and the Gregg amendments and then I will offer \nwhat will be a substitute for those two amendments. I think it needs to \nproceed in that order, if I am not mistaken.\n  Mr. STEVENS. We do plan to offer a unanimous consent request that \nwould bring up amendment No. 217. Is that what the Senator is referring \nto?\n  Mr. DODD. I believe so.\n\n\n                  Amendments Nos. 71 And 78 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Dodd and \nGregg amendments be withdrawn. Would you like to have that adopted \nfirst?\n  Mr. DODD. I think we ought to do that first.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent the pending Dodd and Gregg \namendments be withdrawn. Further, that Senator Dodd be recognized to \ncall up amendment No. 217, that the amendment be modified with the \nchanges that I, Senator Gregg, and Senator Dodd have agreed to, and \nwill send to the desk, that the amendment be agreed to and the motion \nto reconsider be laid on the table. After that, I will ask the Senate \nproceed to other amendments.\n  Does the Senator from Connecticut wish to be heard at this time?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving right to object, I ask the Senator \nto complete the request. Let us get it finished.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Does the Senator from Connecticut withhold?\n  I further ask unanimous consent that the Senate then proceed to the \nconsideration of the following amendments in the following order and \nthat the designated times in relation to the amendments be equally \ndivided in the usual form:\n  Senator Feingold, amendment No. 200, 30 minutes;\n  Senator Mikulski, amendment No. 61, 20 minutes;\n  Senator Murray, amendment No. 30, 20 minutes.\n  I further ask consent that following debate on each amendment, the \namendment be temporarily set aside and a vote occur in relation to each \namendment on Thursday at a time determined by the leader, with no \nsecond-degree amendments in order to any amendments prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senator Feingold has graciously consented to \nlimit his time to 20 minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I amend that request to 20 minutes \ninstead of 30.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, may I \ninquire, if I may have 1 minute.\n  Mr. STEVENS. It is my intention to ask that the Senator from \nConnecticut be recognized for whatever time he needs.\n  Mr. DODD. I would like 3 or 4 minutes to explain what the amendment \nwill achieve.\n\n[[Page S1353]]\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, may we have the consent agreement agreed \nto?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask that the Senator from Connecticut \nbe recognized.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 217, As Modified\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Dodd], for himself and \n     Mr. Stevens, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Kennedy, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. \n     Jeffords, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Edwards, Mr. Dayton, Mr. Corzine, \n     Mr. Kerry, Mr. Reid, Mr. Reed, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Bingaman, \n     Mr. Johnson, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Baucus, and Mr. Kohl, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 217, as modified.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide additional funding for special education programs)\n\n       At the appropriate place, add the following:\n       Sec.  . Funding for the Individuals with Disabilities \n     Education Act. Notwithstanding any other provision of this \n     Act, in addition to any amounts otherwise appropriated under \n     this Act for support of Part B of the Individuals with \n     Disabilities Education Act other than section 619 of such \n     part the following sum is appropriated out of any money in \n     the Treasury not otherwise appropriated for the fiscal year \n     ending September 30, 2003, $1,500,000,000, which shall become \n     available on October 1, 2003, and shall remain available \n     through September 30, 2004, for academic year 2003-2004: \n     Provided, That notwithstanding any other provision of this \n     Act, funds provided under this section shall not result in a \n     further across-the-board rescission under section 601 of \n     Division N.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could direct a question to the manager \nof the bill, it is my understanding that the majority leader has said \nthere will be no more rollcall votes tonight.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, it is my privilege to announce that. I \nwas going to do that after the Senator from Connecticut was finished. I \nassume he is not going to want any further votes. I announce in behalf \nof the majority leader that there will be no further votes this \nevening. The next vote will occur tomorrow at probably around 11 \no'clock.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, Senator Stevens, and Senator Gregg, and, of \ncourse, my colleagues Senator Mikulski and others who spoke eloquently \non this subject matter a few days ago regarding special education \nfunding. I say to my colleague from Alaska that he has been a great \nhelp.\n  This $1.5 billion for special education is going to make a huge \ndifference for schools and communities during the 2003-2004 school \nyear. This is 1-year funding--it is not fully funding special education \nas we have promised, but it is a great step. As I look at the Presiding \nOfficer, a former mayor, I know that Governors all across this country, \nas well as mayors, consistently put special education funding at or \nnear the top of their list of priorities. And, it is especially \nimportant to note that unlike some other amendments that the Senate has \nadopted the past few days, this funding will not come through across \nthe board cuts that include such critical programs as Head Start, WIC, \nand others that I have talked about. This is the way for us to address \nour priorities.\n  I am very grateful to my colleagues for supporting this. I will not \ntake a lot of time this evening to go into it. Obviously, it makes a \nhuge difference to our States, our communities, and, of course, \nfamilies and children who will be the direct beneficiaries of these \nefforts.\n  Our colleague from Alabama spoke the other day about the importance \nof reform in this area. I agree that we need to review these programs \nto make sure the dollars are reaching the families who need them. And \nwe will be reauthorizing IDEA in this Congress as we have in the past. \nBut in the midst of a lot of pressure, I say to the Senator from \nAlaska, the chairman of the committee, that this is a special moment.\n  While it is late evening, and there will be no other recorded votes \ntonight, I want to thank him immensely for working out a solution to \nthis. This may not be perfect. I know that some are a little bit \ndisgruntled over how we managed to get this done. But this will truly \nmake a difference in the lives of children and families. It is a \nspecial moment as we begin this 108th Congress. So, again, I thank the \nSenator from Alaska, and his staff, for working this out with us.\n  And, I thank my colleagues who have been stalwart. Senators Harkin, \nJeffords, and Hagel, among others, who have done, and I know will \ncontinue to do, a tremendous amount of work in this area.\n  Finally, I hope and expect that this amendment, which includes not \nonly myself and the many other Democrats I listed as co-sponsors, but \nalso Senator Stevens, the chair of the Appropriations Committee, and \nSenator Gregg, the chair of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee, will be maintained in conference. I urge the conferees to \noppose any effort to strip this provision that is so critical to our \nchildren and families.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I would like to add my wholehearted \nsupport for the amendment offered by my friend from Connecticut.\n  The passage of IDEA was a watershed event--for children with \ndisabilities and for all Americans.\n  By opening the doors of our public schools, we enabled millions of \ntalented students to join their peers in becoming productive members of \nsociety.\n  Equally important, we improved education for all students by allowing \nthem to know the strength and richness that diverse people with \ndifferent experiences, challenges, and abilities bring to our lives.\n  Finally, we took yet another critical step on our journey to becoming \na country that lives out our ideals of democracy, opportunity, and \nequality.\n  Because we have not lived up to the commitments made in IDEA, the \nfull promise of this law has yet to be fulfilled.\n  Having failed to provide the full 40 percent of excess cost that was \ncommitted over 25 years ago, we have cheated students of the high-\nquality education they deserve.\n  This amendment gives us another chance to right that wrong and move \nforward on a path to full funding.\n  Last year during the ESEA debate, this body unanimously adopted an \namendment that would have fully funded IDEA over the next 6 years.\n  The Dodd amendment would add the first increment of the full funding \nto the appropriations bill.\n  I hope my colleagues have not changed their minds about the \nimportance of funding special education. I hope this amendment will \nalso be adopted unanimously.\n  Frankly, given my home State's projected budget shortfall of $2.4 \nbillion, these funds are even more desperately needed to maintain and \nimprove education for children with disabilities.\n  We have all agreed time and again that it is important to fully fund \nIDEA. Now we can actually provide the dollars to back up those \nstatements. With this amendment, we have the opportunity to make an \nimportant choice for our children's future.\n  Are we going to make the investment in education that all our \nchildren deserve?\n  Or are we going to offer another false promise?\n  Cheating children of their education cheats them of their chance to \nsucceed.\n  This is especially true for children with disabilities, who already \nface a more challenging future. We must do everything in our power to \nensure all children have that chance.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment.\n  Mr. President, recently I received a note from an educator in my \nstate reminding me what this money could mean for our students.\n  Northport School District is a small, rural school district nestled \nbetween the Idaho panhandle and the border with British Columbia. It \nserves 202 students in grades K-12.\n  Mary Swaim is both the special education director and the only \nspecial education teacher in Northport, WA. She has one aide, who \nspends the majority of her day giving physical therapy to six students.\n  Mary told me that they currently have 15 special needs students with \ndisabilities that range from Autism to\n\n[[Page S1354]]\n\nmuscular dystrophy and from Down's Syndrome to learning disabilities.\n  According to Mary, one of these students costs the district $30,000 a \nyear. They have spent a small fortune on therapeutic equipment that \nincludes a Hoyer lift, tables, wheel chairs, walkers and therapy balls.\n  But Mary's concern is not the cost of educating these children. She \nis worried that this small school cannot afford the staff to provide \nthe quality education these students deserve.\n  According to Mary, fully funding IDEA would give Northport the money \nto hire another special education teacher, and would greatly improve \nthese children's chance to learn and to succeed.\n  Mary told me:\n\n       I've watched your legislation to keep class sizes small in \n     general education but, in special education, we frequently \n     have higher numbers than the general education classes and \n     all of our students have far greater needs. More funding \n     would mean quality education. Thank you so much for asking my \n     opinion.\n\n  I believe we need to do more than ask Mary's opinion. I believe we \nneed to listen to her valid concerns and act, as we can today, to make \na difference for the students about whom she is so rightly concerned.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from Mary Swaim \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Dear Senator Murray: You asked what difference it would \n     make to me and my students if IDEA were funded at 40 percent. \n     Northport School District is a small, rural school with 202 \n     students K-12 and we have a B-3 Early Headstart program/4-5 \n     year old EACAP program renting space on our campus. We \n     currently have 15 special needs students that include Autism, \n     multiple handicaps, muscular dystrophy, mental retardation \n     and specific learning disabilities. We could hire a full time \n     teacher on what it costs this district for the autistic \n     student alone ($30,000.00). The muscular dystrophy student \n     costs at least $12,000.00 a year over the funding we receive \n     for him. We have an autistic student who will be three years \n     old in March and will be added to our program and we have two \n     multiple handicapped kindergarten students who require \n     speech, occupational therapy and physical therapy. We have \n     spent a small fortune on therapeutic equipment that includes \n     a Hoyer lift, tables, wheel chairs, walkers and therapy \n     balls. I am the special education teacher/director. I have \n     one full time aide and the majority of her day is spent \n     delivering physical therapy to six students. We receive only \n     a small portion back from Medicaid on what we put out on our \n     students. This small school cannot afford the staff to \n     provide a quality education to these students. I've watched \n     your legislation to keep class sizes small in general \n     education but, in special education, we frequently have \n     higher numbers than the general education classes and all of \n     our students have far greater needs. More funding would mean \n     quality education. Thank you so much for asking my opinion.\n       Mary Swaim, Northport School District #211\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, has the amendment been agreed to?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the amendment is \nagreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 217), as modified, was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 200\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin (Mr. Feingold) for himself, Mr. \n     Leahy, Mr. Wyden, Mrs. Boxer, and Mr. Durbin, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 200.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To restrict funds made available for IMET assistance for \n  Indonesian military personnel to ``Expanded International Military \n Education and Training'' assistance unless certain conditions are met)\n\n       Before the period at the end of the undesignated paragraph \n     under the heading ``International Military Education and \n     Training'', insert the following: ``Provided further, That \n     funds made available under this heading for Indonesian \n     military personnel shall be available only for ``Expanded \n     International Military Education and Training'' assistance, \n     unless the President determines and reports to the \n     appropriate congressional committees that the Government of \n     Indonesia and the Indonesian Armed Forces are (1) \n     demonstrating a commitment to assist United States efforts to \n     combat international terrorism, including United States \n     interdiction efforts against al-Qaida and other terrorist \n     organizations, and taking effective measures to bring to \n     justice those responsible for the October 13, 2002, terrorist \n     attack on Bali, which killed United States citizens, and (2) \n     taking effective measures, including cooperating with the \n     Federal Bureau of Investigation, to bring to justice any \n     member of the Indonesian Armed Forces or Indonesian militia \n     group against whom there is credible evidence of involvement \n     in the August 31, 2002, attack, which resulted in the deaths \n     of United States citizens, and in other gross violations of \n     human rights: Provided further, That nothing in the preceding \n     proviso prohibits the United States from conducting ongoing \n     contacts and training with the Indonesian Armed Forces, \n     including sales of nonlethal defense articles, \n     counterterrorism training, officer visits, port visits, \n     educational exchanges, or Expanded International Military \n     Educational and Training for military officers and \n     civilians''.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask that Senators Leahy, Wyden, Boxer, \nand Durbin be added as cosponsors of this amendment.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a very simple \namendment to this bill.\n  This amendment restricts Indonesian participation in the \nInternational Military Education and Training program, or IMET, \nlimiting that participation to Expanded-IMET only, until the President \ncan determine that Indonesia is doing two things--demonstrating a \ncommitment to assist U.S. efforts to combat terrorism and taking \neffective measures, including cooperating with the FBI, to bring to \njust those members of the Indonesian Armed Forces and militia groups \nagainst whom there is credible evidence of involvement in the August \nattack on American citizens.\n  On August 31, 2002, two American schoolteachers and one Indonesian \ncitizen who were working at an international school for the children of \nFreeport McMoRan's mine employees were killed, and eight more Americans \nwere wounded when they were ambushed on a mountain road in Papua, \nIndonesia. Press reports indicate that Indonesian garrisons control all \naccess to the remote road where the attack occurred. The attackers \nsprayed their targets with automatic weapons--weapons that would be \nrare to find in the hands of separatists in the area. Police reports \nindicated that the Indonesian military was very likely involved in the \nattack, but the investigation was then turned over to the military, \nwhich, not surprisingly, has proven unwilling to investigate itself, \nand unwilling to fully cooperate with the FBI. In November, the \nWashington Post reported that intelligence agencies had obtained \ninformation indicating that, prior to the ambush, senior Indonesian \nmilitary officials discussed an operation targeting Freeport and \nintended to discredit Papuan separatists.\n  The survivors of the attack, and the widows of the murdered, want \ntheir government to pressure the Indonesians to uncover the truth about \nthe attack and to bring those responsible to justice. This Senate \nshould support them.\n  I want to be very clear about what this amendment does not do. It \ndoes not cut off military contacts with Indonesia. Rather, it \nexplicitly states that nothing in the amendment shall prohibit \nimportant national security contacts and programs, including counter-\nterrorism training, sales on non-lethal defense articles, officer \nvisits, port visits, participation in conferences, or educational \nexchanges. The amendment explicitly permits Indonesian civilians and \nmilitary personnel to participate in the expanded-IMET program, which \noffers a wide range of courses highly relevant to the reform efforts so \nimportant to the future of the military in Indonesia's new democratic \nsystem.\n\n  I believe that the United States should work with Indonesia to \nsupport such reforms, and should work within Indonesia and other states \naround the world in making the coalition against terrorism ever \nstronger.\n  The October 12 terrorist attack in Bali made plain that international \nterrorism threatens Indonesia just as it threatens the rest of the \nworld, and I am encouraged by the many positive steps that Indonesia \nhas taken in the wake of that horrific event--steps to track down those \nresponsible using solid law enforcement methods, and\n\n[[Page S1355]]\n\nbroader steps to acknowledge the reality of international terrorism's \nlink to Indonesia. These efforts marked a welcome change from an \ninitial reluctance in Jakarta to acknowledge the fact on the ground. \nMore work remains ahead. The International Crisis Group recently \npublished a powerful report on the Jamaah Islamiyah terrorist network, \na group that is linked to dozens of attacks across Southeast Asia and \nthat is believed by intelligence officials to be associated with al \nQaeda. It is my hope that cooperation with Indonesia will continue to \ngrow stronger.\n  But I also believe that our relations with Indonesia and the \nIndonesian military cannot be characterized by a business-as-usual \napproach until they have made a commitment to cooperate in \ninvestigating the murder of American citizens. In late December, when \nAmerican citizens were brutally murdered in Yemen, the White House \nspoke plainly, stating that ``it is our intention to bring to justice \nany and all people who were responsible for these murders.'' The White \nHouse was right to make that perfectly clear, and I take them at their \nword. And it is all the more important in the Indonesian case--where \none of the institutions of the state may well be responsible for the \nmurder of American citizens, where we find a long history abusive and \nextortionate military practices and an urgent need for military \nreform--it is all the more important, in this case, the U.S. make its \nintentions plain. We must be equally clear with the Indonesians, \nequally resolute in our commitment to get to the bottom of the murders \nin Papua. I hope that my colleagues will join me in this effort, and \nsupport this amendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I strongly support this amendment. It \naddresses a problem that has been a concern of mine for years, which is \nthe involvement of the Indonesian military in deliberate attacks \nagainst American citizens.\n  I fully appreciate that Indonesia is an important country with an \nelected president. We want to support Indonesia in every way we can, \nand we are doing so. The foreign operations portion of this omnibus \nappropriations bill provides $150,000,000 in economic assistance for \nIndonesia, a significant increase above the amount requested by the \nPresident.\n  We are also supporting the Indonesian military. Our armed forces are \nengaging with the Indonesian military at all levels, including \nproviding them millions of dollars in antiterrorism training \nassistance.\n  So no one should be under any illusion that we are not engaging with \nthe Indonesian military or that we are not working with them to thwart \ninternational terrorism. We are training them and we are working with \nthem.\n  We are doing that despite the fact--and this is widely known--that \nthe Indonesian military was responsible for creating and arming some of \nthe most radical Muslim terrorist groups in that country.\n  But that is not what this amendment is about. This amendment focuses \non a separate, $400,000 military training program, which was suspended \nin 1999 after senior Indonesian military officers orchestrated the \nmassacre of some 1,000 people in East Timor, and then lied about it.\n  It was criminal, it was shameful, and it was universally condemned.\n  At that time, we, the Congress, said that we would resume that IMET \ntraining program when the Indonesian military took steps to bring to \njustice those responsible. Was that too much to ask? No one thought so \nat the time. Not here, not in the Pentagon.\n  There has been no justice. In fact, the Indonesian military has \nflagrantly obstructed justice, intimidating, judges and threatening \nwitnesses.\n  But even worse, there is credible evidence that 5 months ago--last \nAugust--the Indonesian military purposefully singled out American \ncitizens for assassination. That they planned an attack which left two \nAmerican teachers dead and several others wounded. Since the, they have \nactively tried to obstruct the police investigation of the crime.\n  We all agree that Indonesia is an important country, and that we need \nto work with the Indonesian government to combat international \nterrorism, and on other issues. We are doing that. But should we not at \nleast expect the Indonesian military to cooperate with the \ninvestigation of the murders of American citizens.\n\n  Is that too much to ask? It is not about the money. The amount of \nmoney is insignificant. It is about the message it sends. This \namendment says that before we resume this tiny military training \nprogram, the deaths of Americans need to be investigated and the people \ninvolved brought to justice.\n  If the military had not actively obstructed the investigation, this \namendment would not be necessary. There is even evidence that an army \nofficer shot at a police investigator, and that a police vehicle was \nattacked. Only after months of refusals and obfuscation, have they \nfinally agreed to let the FBI assist in the investigation, and we do \nnot yet know what access to witnesses or other evidence the FBI will \nhave.\n  This amendment does not cut off anti-terrorism training and it does \nnot cut off the IMET program. In fact, it reinstates the IMET program. \nThere should be no confusion about that. The Feingold amendment \nreinstates the IMET program. But not for combat training--not until \nthey meet the conditions in the amendment.\n  It is a timely and reasonable amendment. It is a simple amendment. It \nis a victims rights amendment.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I yield back time in opposition to this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, it is my understanding we will be \nallotted a moment to summarize prior to the vote on the amendment \ntomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no order to that effect at this time.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I ask the minority whip, what is the intention?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senator Stevens and Senator Byrd, the two \nmanagers of the bill and all these amendments, have allowed the \nparticipants to have a minute on each side. I am sure that will happen \ntomorrow.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, has the other side yielded back their \ntime?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I understand there are two more \namendments to be called up by Senators Mikulski and Murray. For each I \nbelieve we have 20 minutes to speak on behalf of those amendments.\n  I see Senator Mikulski.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 61\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 61 dealing with \nthe contracting out of employment of Federal employees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maryland (Ms. Mikulski), for herself, Mr. \n     Sarbanes, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Bingaman, \n     Mr. Feingold, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Kohl, and Mrs. \n     Murray, proposes an amendment numbered 61.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To prohibit funds to be used to establish, apply, or enforce \n    certain goals relating to Federal employees and public-private \n    competitions or work force conversions, and for other purposes)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. ____. None of the funds made available in this Act may \n     be used by an Executive agency to establish, apply, or \n     enforce any numerical goal, target, or quota for subjecting \n     the employees of the agency to public-private competitions or \n     converting such employees or the work performed by such \n     employees to private contractor performance under the Office \n     of Management and Budget Circular A-76 or any other \n     Administrative regulation, directive, or policy.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my \ncolleague, Senator Harry Reid, be added as a cosponsor of the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, my amendment will prevent the arbitrary \nprivatization of almost a million Federal workers. It prevents agencies \nfrom\n\n[[Page S1356]]\n\nestablishing or applying or enforcing any numerical goal, target, or \nquota for the contracting out of Federal jobs either by public-private \ncompetitions or by directly converting jobs to the private sector.\n  I want to be very clear, I am not against privatization, but I \nbelieve the privatization should be based on thoughtful criteria, not \narbitrary numerical quotas.\n  This administration has stated, in another arena, they are absolutely \nagainst quotas. So am I. But they seem to use quotas when it is \nconvenient. I do not understand why OMB wants to use quotas to get rid \nof Federal employees. Let's not use quotas at all, whether it is to get \ninto college or to get rid of Federal workers.\n  Right now, many people are thinking about how to reform the Federal \nworkforce. Excellent thinking. Former Federal Reserve Chairman Volcker \nand Senator Voinovich--leaders in this area--have put a lot of work \ninto this issue. What they are saying, loud and clear, is, we need to \nbe able to recruit the best, we need to be able to retain the best, we \nneed to be able to maintain the integrity of the civil service system \nand make sure it never lapses into cronyism or political patronage. I \nam for their approach.\n  Why am I offering this amendment? And why would that go against the \nthinking I have just talked about? Because the Office of Management and \nBudget has issued a directive calling for bounty hunters in Federal \nagencies to get rid of 850,000 jobs over the next 3 years. That is \nnearly half of the Federal workforce. No agency would be immune from \nthese cuts. And, more importantly, there is no criteria for the cuts. \nManagers will be forced to meet arbitrary targets, sometimes against \ntheir will or even their better judgment--without careful criteria, \nwithout rationale, without guidelines; and without considering: Would \nprivatization of these jobs affect national security? Is it cost-\neffective for the taxpayer? What is its impact on the mission of each \nagency? And what would arbitrary, cavalier, swashbuckling privatization \nmean?\n  I think it is a dangerous trend with our Federal employees. Look at \nthe Customs Service. Recently, they were made part of the Homeland \nSecurity Department. Their top priority should be protecting our \nborders and our ports, like stopping the millennium bomber. They should \nbe searching for terrorists instead of wasting their time searching for \nprivate companies to do part of their job.\n  Next let's look at DOD. We may be going to war. Yet the Army would \nhave to contract out as many as 200,000 jobs. Transferring these jobs \nto the private sector could seriously erode morale and readiness. While \nthe military is fighting a war against terrorism, and maybe even a war \nin Iraq, let's not have a war within the Pentagon over who gets to keep \ntheir job.\n  Who are the kinds of people I am talking about? I am thinking about a \nsecretary at the FBI in the Baltimore field office who has worked there \nfor close to 50 years. During the terrible sniper case that gripped our \nwhole Capital region, the FBI was on the job with our local law \nenforcement, along with the BATF, and it was the people in the back \noffice keeping the agency support.\n\n  What are we going to say to that secretary who has worked with field \nofficers, who has helped keep the FBI going for over 48 years and went \nto the same high school I went to and, by the way, Congresswoman \nPelosi? Hello. Thank you very much. You are part of a quota. You are \ngoing to be replaced by a Kelly Girl. There is nothing wrong with Kelly \nGirls, but there is nothing wrong with a dedicated secretary who stuck \nwith the FBI for 50 years so they could be effective and out there on \nthe job protecting us.\n  So I am not seeking an end to privatization, but I think we should \nfollow the FAIR Act. I think we should follow OMB's A-76 circular on \nthese kinds of things.\n  Privatization is a code word to go after Federal employees. I do not \nknow why OMB wants to do this. There is even a question of whether it \nwill save money.\n  First of all, we have now the smallest Federal workforce since the \n1960s. Also, at the same time, we know, from Federal managers \nthemselves, that they are really nervous about this OMB directive \nbecause they think it will, first, undermine morale; and, second, there \nis no clear criteria. And instead of doing the job, they now have to \njustify the job.\n  I do not know why we are so prickly, hostile to our Federal \nemployees. Who are the Federal employees? They are the Customs \ninspectors, they are the nurses at our VA hospitals, and they are the \npeople at Social Security who make sure the seniors get their checks on \ntime.\n  I am a Senator from Maryland, and I am really proud of it. I \nrepresent over 100,000 Federal employees. I wish you could meet them \nthe way I do: on the job, at supermarkets. I represent people who are \nNobel Prize winners at the National Institutes of Health and the \nNational Institute of Standards and Technology. I represent people who \nwork for the Coast Guard who are out there protecting our coast. I \nrepresent FBI agents. I represent the National Security Agency, the \nfaculty at the United States Naval Academy that is getting our next \ngeneration of leaders ready.\n  They work hard every day to guard our borders, protect our homes, get \nAmerica ready for the future. Workers in the FDA are protecting our \nfood supply and making sure our pharmaceuticals are safe. They are also \nthe Federal employees in other parts of America, the ones who died at \nthe World Trade Center. How about the ones who died at the Pentagon? \nHow about the ones who lost their lives in Oklahoma City? They were \nprotecting our Nation. They were protecting our communities.\n  We said a grateful Nation will never forget. Well, let's not forget \nthem when it comes to pushing out their colleagues from the Federal \nworkforce. I know what Federal employees do. They work hard. They think \nfor themselves first as citizens of the United States and second as \nworkers at missions-driven agencies.\n  Let me just close by saying this. We need to have a civil service in \nthis country. And we need to have a civil service that is reliable and \nhas integrity and is independent.\n  We have gone from an age of patronage politics to an age of partisan \npolitics. I believe the American people want us to be in an age of \nperformance politics. That means keeping a civil service. Do not fool \naround with the civil service. Don't just contract it out and reward \nyour pals through cronyism or a new form of patronage.\n  I fought a political machine to get into politics, and I will fight a \npolitical machine that will try to destroy the civil service of the \nUnited States.\n  Let's keep a strong nonpolitical Federal workforce. Let's get rid of \nthe quotas for the OMB circular, and let's take a rational approach \nmaintaining the civil service but privatizing those jobs that are \nappropriate.\n  I yield the floor and reserve time that I might need for rebuttal.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \namendment offered by the Senator from Maryland, Ms. Mikulski, of which \nI am a cosponsor.\n  I have long been concerned about the costs and benefits associated \nwith the process by which the Federal Government contracts out work. In \nparticular, I am concerned about the lack of data on whether these \ncontracts actually achieve real savings for taxpayers, and about the \neffects of outsourcing on the pay and benefits of Federal workers.\n  I do not oppose contracting out. Such a process is often appropriate. \nI am concerned, however, that the arbitrary quotas proposed by the \nOffice of Management and Budget will encourage Federal agencies to \ncircumvent the existing public-private competition process for \ncontracting out work without regard for what is the best use of \ntaxpayer dollars. Contracting out affects the jobs of thousands of \ndedicated Government employees each year. These men and women deserve \nthe chance to compete for this work--and for their jobs--on a level \nplaying field.\n  The amendment offered by the Senator from Maryland would prohibit OMB \nfrom using numerical targets to privatize jobs currently filled by \nFederal employees. It would not prevent Federal agencies from \ncontracting out. Instead, it would ensure that contracting decisions \nare based on what is\n\n[[Page S1357]]\n\nbest for American taxpayers, rather than on arbitrary quotas set by \nOMB.\n  The language included in the Mikulski amendment was adopted by the \nSenate Appropriations Committee last year as part of the fiscal year \n2003 Treasury-Postal appropriations bill. It was also adopted \noverwhelmingly by the House of Representatives by a vote of 261-166 \nduring that body's consideration of the fiscal year 2003 Treasury-\nPostal appropriations bill.\n  I remain concerned about the administration's push to contract out \nhundreds of thousands of Federal jobs with little regard for true \npublic-private competition. Late last year, OMB released its proposed \nchanges to the Circular A-76 process, that, if adopted, would result in \nthe privatization of 850,000 Federal jobs nearly half of the Federal \nworkforce. The proposed revisions would allow agencies to contract out \njobs currently held by Federal employees without public-private \ncompetition. In addition, the proposal would force agencies to \nprivatize work without competition if they fail to meet arbitrary \ndeadlines for contracting out work.\n  The proposal further undermines competition by rarely allowing \nFederal employees to compete for new work or work that is currently \nbeing done by contractors. It would also switch to a so-called ``best \nvalue'' system of competition, rather than continuing the current cost-\nbased system that takes into account quality of work.\n  OMB's proposal does nothing to improve the tracking of costs and \nbenefits of contracted work or to ensure that there is oversight to \ndetermine whether the contractors are providing quality services or \notherwise complying with the terms of their contracts. Further, once a \ncontractor has been awarded a job, there is no mechanism to recompete \nthe work at a later date to ensure that taxpayers are actually \nreceiving the best work for the best price.\n  I agree that the Federal contracting system needs reform. But to rush \nto outsource the positions of nearly half of the Federal workforce in \nan arbitrary manner, and without allowing these dedicated workers to \ncompete to keep their jobs, is shortsighted. We should proceed \ncautiously to ensure that the contracting process is fair to Federal \nworkers and that it actually results in a quality, cost-effective \nproduct for taxpayers. OMB's current plan for arbitrary quotas and \nlittle public-private competition will not achieve these goals.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to support and cosponsor \nSenator Mikulski's amendment to the omnibus appropriations bill. Our \namendment would prevent funds appropriated by this bill from being used \nto impose privatization quotas on Federal agencies. This amendment \nwould promote sensible procurement policies by eliminating the need to \ncontract out Federal work just to meet subjective targets. Decisions to \ncontract out Federal work, which would reduce the Federal workforce, \nshould never be based on political objectives. This amendment is an \nimportant step towards preventing contracting decisions based on \narbitrary quotas.\n  Under proposed regulations governing privatization, up to 850,000 \nFederal employee jobs will be reviewed for privatization. At minimum, \nthe administration intends to open up at least 425,000 Federal jobs to \ncompetition by the end of 2004. The decision to do so is not based on \ndata or hard science. How did the administration choose that number? I \nwant my colleagues to know that there is no evidence that outsourcing \nsuch a sizeable number of Federal jobs so quickly will achieve any cost \nsavings at all. The proposed revisions to A-76, the regulations \ngoverning the contracting of Federal work, support outsourcing quotas \nby forcing agencies to outsource jobs without first holding public-\nprivate competitions, regardless of whether the move to privatization \nsaves the Government any money.\n  Arbitrary quotas serve no purpose, and they place Federal workers in \nthe unenviable position of never knowing whether their job will be \neliminated. Even if employees were to understand the regulations \ngoverning Federal contracting, they would be competing in a system that \nis skewed toward private-sector bidders. Moreover, Federal managers are \nill-prepared and undertrained to deal with large-scale outsourcing of \ngovernment work. Federal employees are being forced to compete for jobs \nthey already hold with very little, if any, training or guidance on how \nto enter the Federal contracting process and successfully compete with \nseasoned bidders. The past performance of Federal employees will not be \ntaken into account when analyzing whether a Government contract should \nbe awarded. However, a great value will be placed on the past \nperformance of a private contractor.\n  As a member of the Governmental Affairs Committee, I am committed to \nan efficient, effective, and responsive Federal Government. However, as \nwe look for ways to achieve this, we must ensure that contracting \nobjectives are fair to our Federal workforce and result in cost \nsavings. I do not believe that these goals are mutually exclusive. I \nwill continue to work toward ensuring that Federal procurement policies \nare fair to Federal workers and cost-effective. The Mikulski amendment \nachieves this end, and I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I yield back the time on this side.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, if the other side yields back its time, \nI therefore yield back my time and know that there will be an agreement \nto vote on my amendment that will be concluded at the end of the \nevening.\n  I thank my colleague from Alabama. I hope all my debates are that \neasy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nWashington is recognized.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 39\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 39 and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mrs. Murray], for herself, Mr. \n     Kennedy, Mr. Reed, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Dodd, Ms. \n     Cantwell, and Ms. Stabenow, proposes an amendment numbered \n     39.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     (Purpose: To provide funding for the community access program)\n\n       On page 570, line 19, insert before the period the \n     following: ``; Provided further, That $120,027,000 shall be \n     appropriated to carry out the community access program to \n     increase the capacity and effectiveness of community health \n     care institutions and providers who serve patients regardless \n     of their ability to pay''.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am offering this amendment on behalf of \nmyself, Senators Kennedy, Reed, Clinton, Bingaman, Dodd, Stabenow, and \nCantwell.\n  The amendment I have called up is very simple. It restores the $120 \nmillion to the Community Access Program that was cut in the managers' \namendment. This $120 million level is exactly the same level as we \nappropriated in fiscal year 2002, and it is the same level that was \nincluded in the fiscal year 2003 Labor-HHS-Education appropriations \nbill which we marked up last year.\n  The Community Access Program helps increase the capacity and \neffectiveness of community health care institutions and providers that \nserve patients regardless of their ability to pay.\n  It is a community-based program that seeks to coordinate care for the \nuninsured. It has been very successful, and it enjoys broad bipartisan \nsupport.\n  It is difficult for me to understand why the President's budget \neliminates a program that seeks to get care for the uninsured at a time \nwhen the ranks of the uninsured continue to grow. Without a coordinated \ncommunity-based approach to accessing care, the uninsured simply end up \nin our emergency rooms or go without care, and both of those results \nadd to our growing health care crisis.\n  I know firsthand how successful this program has been. Washington \nState has four CAP grantees that have worked to expand access to \nquality, comprehensive care for those who have no health care safety \nnet. They are\n\n[[Page S1358]]\n\nbased in Spokane, Wenatchee, Olympia, and Seattle.\n  As I have met with our CAP grantees, they have shown me a glimpse \ninto what I think is the future of health care.\n  In October I visited the Odessa Brown Children's Clinic. I saw a \ndoctor, a dentist, and a psychologist in the same room, not just \ntreating body parts but actually treating the whole child in a \ncomprehensive, compassionate way. Today that project is known as ``Kids \nGet Care,'' and it is connecting more than 3,000 children to \ncomprehensive health care.\n  These kinds of efforts are making a real difference for low-income \nfamilies, and they need more investment. Our CAP grantees have worked \nto ensure that our increased investment in community health centers \nreaps the greatest benefit possible. They have worked with vulnerable \npopulations to tear down barriers to care and not just economic \nbarriers. They use the small investment to better serve the uninsured. \nWe should be strengthening efforts like this right now, not eliminating \nthem.\n  Currently in my home State of Washington, one in nine residents is \nuninsured. And with my State's ongoing economic crisis--and I am sure \nacross the country--demand is going to grow for programs that provide \ncare for the uninsured. We need to meet the immediate needs of these \nfamilies who today can only get access in the emergency room.\n  CAP provides the seed money that gives community health care \nproviders the ability to serve those who have nowhere else to go.\n  As a member of the HELP Committee, I am disappointed that the \nmajority has proposed eliminating this program. The HELP Committee \nworked in a bipartisan manner, under the leadership of Senators \nKennedy, Gregg, and Frist, and secured passage of a 4-year health care \nsafety net authorization bill. Last year that provided an authorization \nof this CAP program. That legislation was, in fact, unanimously adopted \nby the Senate in October of 2002 and signed by the President on October \n26, 2002.\n\n  The purpose of the authorization is spelled out now in Public Law \n107-251. I want to read the committee report. The purpose is:\n\n       To provide assistance to communities and to consortia of \n     health care providers, in order to develop or strengthen an \n     integrated health care delivery system that coordinates \n     health services for individuals who are uninsured and \n     individuals who are underinsured and to develop or strengthen \n     activities related to providing coordinated care for \n     individuals with chronic conditions.\n\n  Those are goals we must achieve. I understand the fiscal pressures \nfacing the chairman of the Appropriations Committee and Chairman \nSpecter, but we are facing a major health care crisis in this country. \nThis is not just a crisis of the uninsured but a crisis of increasing \ncosts. The impact of this will only mean higher Federal expenditures in \nprograms such as Medicare and Medicaid, not to mention the human toll \non our uninsured citizens.\n  I applaud the recent comments by the new majority leader in \ndiscussing the racial inequities in our health care delivery system, \nand I look forward to working with him to address this injustice and to \nensure greater access to care for all Americans. Fair and just access \nto care is a civil rights issue.\n  Being uninsured does not have to mean going without. We can offer a \nsafety net to provide comprehensive care to the uninsured through \nprograms such as CAP and community health centers.\n  I believe that CAP provides us a model for closing the gaps in health \ncare and eliminating racial inequities. If we truly hope to provide \nfair and equal access, we must not eliminate CAP in this bill.\n  CAP is certainly not the only solution, but we all know that in order \nto address our health care crisis, we have to find innovative solutions \nthat use our resources more effectively, and CAP does just that. It \nsupports innovative community-based programs.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I remind them, it was \nauthorized by the full committee last year, unanimously passed the \nSenate, and has broad bipartisan support. We need to back our words in \nthat bill with the resources for these communities to provide care for \nthe uninsured and the growing ranks of uninsured across this country. \nWe need to strengthen our fragile health care safety net across this \ncountry, and this amendment will help us do that.\n  I thank the Chair and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington for \nher comments. I had the pleasure a little over a year ago to travel to \nfive different rural health clinics in Alabama, many of these in areas \nwhere minority citizens live, and was very pleased to have the chief \nAssistant Secretary of Health and Human Services, Claude Allen, to do \nthat, an African-American himself, the chief deputy to Tommy Thompson.\n  My understanding is the administration does support rural health \nclinics; in fact, it has plans to expand them. Properly done, it would \nbe the right way to go. I will be looking at the Senator's amendment \nand reviewing that as we go forward.\n  I think the general policy and the general direction of this \nadministration will be to expand those clinics rather than to reduce \nthem.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we are waiting for the assistant \nDemocratic leader, and while Senator Murray is here, I will add further \non that subject that we visited rural health clinics in Alabama. They \ndo a lot of work. Somehow we have created a system of health care where \nit is not easy for physicians and health care professionals to choose \nto live in rural areas, and it has taken Government programs to meet \nthe crisis need. I wish we could figure out a way to incentivize it so \na person who might like to live in a small town could practice medicine \nthere and make a decent living and have a nice life. Somehow we have \nnot done that effectively. That is the reason we have felt the need to \ncreate these clinics with Government support.\n\n\n                         Textile Transshipments\n\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, it is my understanding that in the 107th \nCongress, $9.5 million was authorized by the Trade Promotion Authority \nAct for the hiring of up to 71 new customs agents to more vigorously \nenforce the existing textile trade agreements. I ask Senator Campbell, \nis that correct?\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Yes, it is.\n  Mrs. DOLE. And it is also my understanding that this funding was not \nincluded in the final version of the bill before us. Is that also \ncorrect?\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Yes, that is correct.\n  Mrs. DOLE. I understand the severe budget restraints you and the \ncommittee were working under to produce this final bill. I wish that \nthe committee had been able to fund this very important measure.\n  Since 1996, 65,7000 jobs have been lost in North Carolina alone in \nthe textile industry. However, contrary to some opinions, the North \nCarolina textile industry can compete domestically and worldwide if, \nand I strongly emphasize ``if,'' the Federal Government allocates the \nresources to its customs agents to do their jobs and enforce existing \ntrade agreements.\n  Chuck Hayes, the former head of the American Textile Manufacturers \nInstitute, once said that thousands of textile jobs could have been \nsaved in North Carolina if the United States had rigorously enforced \nour existing textile trade agreements.\n  But in order to do that, the Customs Service needs to hire many more \nexperienced agents to be able to investigate cases of illegally shipped \ntextile products into the United States through our ports. It is a \nmassive undertaking but one that we must pursue in order to save the \nremaining textile jobs in North Carolina and elsewhere and put our \ndomestic textile industry on a more equal basis versus overseas \nmanufacturers.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I fully understand and appreciate the Senator's \nfeelings on this matter and I will work with her on this problem in the \nnext appropriations cycle for fiscal year 2004.\n  Mrs. DOLE. I thank the Senator for that pledge to work with me. The \nhealth and welfare of thousands of hard-working North Carolina families \ndepends on enforcing the textile trade agreements we now have in force. \nI will continue to stay in close contact with you and the committee on \nthis issue.\n\n\n                             Port Security\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise to request to enter into a \ncolloquy with\n\n[[Page S1359]]\n\nthe chairman and the ranking member on the Treasury and General \nGovernment Appropriations Subcommittee, the distinguished Senators from \nColorado and North Dakota, regarding port security.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the security of our Nation's ports is of \nextreme importance to me, so I gladly will engage in a colloquy with \nthe senior Senator from Washington. Being from a northern border state, \nlike the senior Senator from Washington, I am particularly concerned \nabout how others may try to use the border to circumvent our security. \nFurthermore, it is important that improving our security doesn't \nunnecessarily infringe upon commerce that travels over our northern \nborder.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I also agree that securing our Nation's \nports and points of entry is critical to protecting our citizens.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, on October 31, 2002, the U.S. Customs \nService published regulations requiring sea carriers to provide cargo \nmanifests 24 hours prior to the lading of containerized cargo at \nforeign ports for shipment to the United States. In short, since \nDecember 2, 2002, the Customs Service has been asking for a detailed \nlist of all cargo entering a U.S. port and detailed information \nregarding the shipper. This will allow Customs agents to identify at-\nrisk cargo, thus making our ports safer.\n  My State of Washington includes the ports of Seattle and Tacoma. \nThese ports combined represent the Nation's third largest intermodal \ncontainer gateway. So I applaud this initiative, which will allow \ncustoms agents the opportunity to identify at risk cargo, while \nexpediting the process for low-risk cargo.\n  Having said that, I am concerned that if this rule is not adopted by \nthe Customs authorities in countries with whom we share a border, we \ncould actually make our borders even less secure. There is a \nsubstantial flow of overseas containerized goods coming over the \nCanadian and Mexican borders, especially the Canadian border, into the \nU.S. annually. If those goods are not subject to the 24-hour rule, as \noverseas containerized goods coming through U.S. ports are, we have \ndefeated the intent of the rule. In addition, we are actually providing \nan incentive for shippers to use the Canadian or Mexican gateways \ninstead of bringing their goods through U.S. ports. This scenario hurts \nus in two ways. First, it diminishes the security at our borders if the \nsame rules do not apply to overseas containerized goods coming through \nCanada or Mexico, and second, if shipping lines flock to ports located \nin our northern and southern neighbors to bring goods into the U.S. due \nto the ``hassle factor,'' it takes jobs and the potential for economic \ngrowth from our communities.\n  For this reason, I am gratified to learn that the Canadian government \nis in the process of considering port security regulations of its own. \nU.S. Customs has thus far been able to work successfully with Canadian \nCustoms on programs such as the Smart Border Accord, the Container \nSecurity Initiative, and the Customs Trade Partnership Against \nTerrorism effort.\n  So I am asking the distinguished Senators from Colorado and North \nDakota regardless of whether the Canadian Government does or does not \nimplement a similar advanced manifest information requirement, to with \nme to see our Government require the same manifest information on all \ncontainer traffic that is destined to the United States on a through-\nbill-of-lading via a Canadian or Mexican port.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nWashington for raising this issue with me. Congress must be vigilant in \nmaking sure that all cargo entering this country via any method--sea, \nair, or rail--faces the same level of scrutiny. Should the perception \ndevelop that it is easier to move goods into the U.S. through Canada, \nnot only would our Nation's ports be disadvantaged economically, but \nour country would face a greater security risk. As you point out, \nregulation on ship traffic is moving ahead. I understand that Customs \nCommissioner Bonner has directed that regulations regarding rail, air, \nand truck shipments be kept on track. I certainly will work with the \ndistinguished Senator from Washington and the Customs Service to ensure \nthat all cargo entering the United States receives equal scrutiny.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I will work with the Senator from \nWashington, my ranking member, and the Customs Service to achieve this \nimportant goal. We must work hard to plug the security holes that \nexist, and this is one we should fix.\n\n\n                   PROVIDENCE PERFORMING ARTS CENTER\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, as we move forward on this measure, I \nnoted in the Senate Report accompanying the FY 2003 Commerce, Justice, \nState, and the Judiciary Appropriations bill that the Appropriations \nCommittee urged the Economic Development Administration (EDA) to \nevaluate several worthwhile proposals for projects which may be \neligible for funding under the various EDA programs.\n  Mr. GREGG. That is correct. The committee listed six such proposals.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I would like to make the Senator from New Hampshire, the \nChairman of the Commerce Appropriations Subcommittee, aware of a strong \neconomic development proposal from my home state of Rhode Island.\n  The proposal focuses on the renovation of the restored historic \ntheater at the Providence Performing Arts Center, PPAC, in our capital \ncity of Providence. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, \nthe facility was recently named an Official Project of the Save \nAmerica's Treasures program directed by the National Trust for Historic \nPreservation and the White House Millennium Council. The full \nrenovation of the theater, both structural and mechanical, is the \nultimate goal of the non-profit entity that operates the center. A \nrenovated PPAC has the potential to be one of the major economic \ndevelopment stimulants in the old downtown. I know from my membership \non the Environment and Public Works Committee, which has authorizing \njurisdiction over the EDA, that this project is very similar to others \nfunded by the agency.\n  I ask the chairman if the Providence initiative is in keeping with \nthe projects recommended by the committee and listed in the report?\n  Mr. GREGG. It is. In fact, the proposal to renovate and operate a \nvibrant theater appears to be just the type of job-creating project EDA \nshould be encouraging in our downtowns.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. That being so, I ask the chairman if he would deem the \nProvidence project part of the committee's recommendation to the EDA.\n  Mr. GREGG.

Mr. President, our colleague in the House of \nRepresentatives, Frank Wolf, recently returned from a visit to Ethiopia \nand Eritrea. His report on the trip describes the dire health and \nhumanitarian crisis in these countries.\n  Congressman Wolf states that, without urgently needed support, an \nadditional 11 million people may perish because of the famine \nexacerbated by drought, because of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, and because \nof the lingering effects of those countries' 2\\1/2\\ year border war.\n  These issues are extremely serious, and the international community \ncan and must do more to help alleviate this crisis. I believe that \nCongressman Wolf's report will be of interest to all of us in the \nSenate, and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the \nCongressional Record.\n\n[[Page S1360]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Trip Report: Ethiopia and Eritrea--December 29, 2002-January 4, 2003\n\n       Babies wailing and screeching, desperately trying to get \n     nourishment from their mothers' breasts.\n       Two- and three-year-olds so severely malnourished that they \n     cannot stand, much less crawl or walk, their pencil-thin legs \n     so frail that they could be snapped like a twig with little \n     or no effort.\n       Young boys and girls with bloated bellies. A teenager whose \n     legs are no thicker than my wrist.\n       Drinking water almost non-existent--a four-hour walk each \n     way just to find some. Fields scorched. Crops failed.\n       River beds dry as a bone. Hand-dug collecting ponds for \n     rain so sun-baked that the earth has cracked.\n       Disease. Despair.\n       These are some of the horrific sites I witnessed last week \n     in Ethiopia, which once again is facing a famine of \n     catastrophic proportions.\n       I spent a week in Ethiopia in 1984--when nearly one million \n     people died of starvation--including two nights in a feeding \n     camp. The squalid conditions of the camps and the suffering \n     faces of the children, mothers and elderly were haunting and \n     unforgettable. What I saw--and experienced--changed me \n     forever. I never thought I would see something like that \n     again. I have. Last week.\n       By Easter, thousands of Ethiopians could be dead from \n     starvation. Children living in villages just 90 miles from \n     the capital city, Addis Ababa, which is easily accessible by \n     truck, are already near death. Conditions in villages in more \n     remote areas of the country are significantly worse.\n\n\n                             Dire Situation\n\n       While the government of Ethiopia is out in front of trying \n     to draw attention to the crisis--unlike in 1984 when the \n     Mengistu government tried to keep the famine secret until a \n     BBC camera crew broke the story--what makes this year's \n     crisis more horrific is that the population of Ethiopia has \n     increased from 45 million in 1984 to 69 million today. In \n     addition, HIV/AIDS is spreading throughout the country and \n     Ethiopia's 2\\1/2\\-year border was with neighboring Eritrea \n     has drained precious resources and led to thousands of \n     displaced people and families, particularly in remote areas \n     of the country.\n       With each crisis--drought, war, disease--more families \n     become destitute and completely dependent on others for their \n     welfare and survival. The repeated droughts have made more \n     people vulnerable to hunger and hunger-related diseases, \n     sharply increasing the danger of outright starvation among \n     groups that may have been able to survive previous crop \n     failures and livestock losses.\n       This also is a tough neighborhood, with Sudan bordering to \n     the west and Somalia to the east. These countries are \n     struggling to overcome internal turmoil of their own and \n     refugees from each have crossed into Ethiopia and are living \n     in refugee camps.\n       But perhaps the greatest difficulty is getting the world to \n     respond. The focus in capital cities around the globe is the \n     war on terror, Iraq and North Korea.\n\n\n                         how could this happen?\n\n       I do not believe this situation should ever have been \n     allowed to develop. Does anyone really believe that the world \n     would turn a blind eye if this crisis were unfolding in \n     France or Australia? If the photographs in this report were \n     of Norwegian children wouldn't the world be rushing to help? \n     Is not the value of an Ethiopian child or Eritrean mother the \n     same in the eyes of God?\n       This disaster has been building since last fall, yet there \n     has been little mention of it in the Western media, let alone \n     any in depth reports. Without graphic photographs and video-\n     tape, foreign governments will not feel the pressure to act.\n       The situation in Ethiopia is dire and many believe if \n     immediate action is not taken to address the looming crisis, \n     the number of people who could die from starvation could \n     surpass those who perished during the 1984-1985 drought. In \n     1984, 8 million were in need of food aid. Today, more than 11 \n     million people--just slightly less than the combined \n     population of Maryland and Virginia--are presently at risk \n     and that number is growing every day.\n       Last year's crops produced little or nothing, even in parts \n     of the country that normally provide surpluses of food. The \n     demand for international food aid is tremendous. I was told \n     there is enough food in the country to meet January's needs \n     and part of February's, although at reduced levels. \n     Incredibly, there is nothing in the pipeline to deal with \n     March, April, May, or the rest of the year. Even if ships \n     leaded with grain were to leave today, many would not make it \n     in time to avert disaster.\n       Villagers are living on about 900 calories a day. The \n     average American lives on 2,200 to 2,400 calories a day.\n       An elderly woman at a feeding station in the northern part \n     of the country showed me her monthly allotment of wheat: it \n     would have fit into a bowling ball bag.\n       A man working under the hot African sun with fellow \n     villagers to dig a massive rain collecting pond--each \n     carrying 50-pound bags of dirt up from the bottom of the \n     pit--told me he had not had a drink of water all day and \n     didn't know if he would eat that night. It would depend on \n     whether his children had food.\n\n\n                                no water\n\n       Water--for drinking and bathing--is almost non-existent, \n     and what is available, is putrid. There is no medicine--and \n     even if there was something as simple as an aspirin there is \n     no water with which to wash it down. Disease is rampant.\n       During my trip I visited villages in both the north and \n     south of the country. I went to a food distribution center \n     and a health clinic. I talked with farmers who had already \n     begun to sell off their livestock and mothers who did not \n     know where or when their children would get their next meal. \n     I met with U.S. State Department officials and NGOs. I also \n     met with Prime Minister Meles and a number of relief \n     officials in his government.\n       The government's decision not to establish feeding camps is \n     a wise one. The camps only exacerbate the crisis because they \n     allow diseases to spread much more quickly and take people \n     away from their homes and albeit limited support systems. In \n     1984, many families traveled great distances to reach the \n     camps and by the time they got there were often near death. \n     Moreover, villagers who left for the camps and somehow \n     managed to survive had nothing to return to because they had \n     lost their homes and sold their livestock.\n       Fortunately, relief organizations, including U.S. AID and \n     the United Nations World Food Programme, have developed an \n     early warning system to better predict the effects of the \n     looming crisis and have been sounding the alarm since the \n     fall.\n       Nevertheless, they are facing an uphill battle. Donor \n     fatigue is a very real problem.\n\n\n                         competing world crisis\n\n       Getting the world--and the United States, in particular--to \n     focus on the issue is difficult because of the war on \n     terrorism, the situation in Iraq and the growing crisis in \n     North Korea.\n       Since August 2002, the United States has provided \n     approximately 430,000 metric tons of food, valued at $179 \n     million. This amount constitutes approximately 25 percent of \n     the total need in the country. The U.S. government will need \n     to do more to avert a disaster of biblical proportions.\n       Before leaving on the trip, a number of well read people in \n     the Washington area looked at me quizzically when I told them \n     I was going to Ethiopia. They all asked why? When I told them \n     that the country was facing another famine along the scale of \n     1984, they were dumbfounded.\n       Time is of the essence. A village can slip dramatically in \n     just a matter of weeks. Many of the children I saw last week \n     will be dead by early February and those who do somehow \n     miraculously survive will be severely retarded. The world \n     cannot afford to wait any longer.\n       I also visited neighboring Eritrea, where the situation is \n     not much better. Widespread crop failures are expected as a \n     result of the drought. Compounding the situation are the \n     lingering effects of its war with Ethiopia, which ended in \n     December 2000. While nearly 200,000 refugees and displaced \n     persons have been reintegrated into society following the \n     truce, almost 60,000 have been unable to return to their \n     homes due to the presence of land mines, unexploded ordnance, \n     insecurity or the simple fact that the infrastructure near \n     their homes has been completely destroyed.\n\n\n                            recommendations\n\n       Donors, including the United States, must make prompt and \n     significant food-aid pledges to help Ethiopia overcome its \n     current crisis. The food pipeline could break down as early \n     as next month if donors do not act immediately. There are a \n     number of countries, Canada and France, for instance, that \n     can and should do more.\n       The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) must work to \n     ensure that the U.S. assistance is released as quickly as \n     possible.\n       When President Bush visits Africa, he should consider going \n     to Ethiopia. I believe he would be moved by what he sees.\n       The Bush Administration should make an effort to rally \n     public support similar to what was done during the 1984-85 \n     famine. Perhaps the new director of faith-based initiatives \n     at USAID should serve as the coordinator for such an effort.\n       Donor support also must include water, seeds and medicine \n     as well as veterinary assistance.\n       The Ethiopian government should take its case to capitals \n     around the globe, sending representatives to donor nations \n     armed with photographs of dying children to put a face on the \n     growing crisis. Regrettably, if they do not ask, they will \n     not receive.\n       The Ethiopian government must contribute additional food \n     aid from its own resources as it did in 2000 and 2002 as a \n     sign of leadership and commitment to the welfare of its \n     people.\n       More must be done to develop long-term strategies to tackle \n     the root causes of the food shortages in Ethiopia, like \n     improving irrigation and developing drought-resistant crops. \n     The government must develop a 10- or 15-year plan designed to \n     help end the constant cycle of massive food shortages. A well \n     developed plan would go a long way toward reassuring the \n     international community that the country wants to end its \n     dependence on handouts.\n       The Ethiopian government also should do more to help \n     diversity its economy. Its largest export--coffee--is subject \n     to huge price\n\n[[Page S1361]]\n\n     fluctuations in the world market and rather than exporting \n     hides and leather to Italy and China--only to come back as \n     belts, purses and shoes--the government should work to \n     attract business that will make these products on Ethiopian \n     soil.\n       The government of Ethiopia also should consider a sweeping \n     land reform policy that would allow farmers to own their \n     property rather than the government owning all the country's \n     land, a vestige of the country's socialist days.\n       The media needs to more aggressively pursue this looming \n     crisis. It was responsible for making the world aware of the \n     terrible famine that was occurring in 1984 and has the \n     ability to let the world know about the tragedy unfolding \n     again.\n       Many of the same issues that apply to Ethiopia apply to \n     Eritrea. Both countries are in desperate need of assistance.\n       In closing, I want to thank all the people--from government \n     officials in both Ethiopia and Eritrea to U.S. officials and \n     NGOs and missionaries in both countries--who are working \n     around the clock to deal with this crisis. I also want to \n     thank U.S. Ambassador to Eritrea Donald McConnell and U.S. \n     Ambassador to Ethiopia Auzerlia Brazeal and their respective \n     staffs for all they do. They are outstanding representatives \n     of the U.S. government. Special thanks go to Jack Doutrich in \n     Eritrea and Karen Freeman, Jo Raisin and Makeda Tsegaye in \n     Ethiopia. Roy ``Reb'' Brownell with USAID in Washington also \n     deserves special recognition.\n       Finally, I want to thank Lt. Col. Malcom Shorter, who \n     accompanied me on the trip, and Dan Scandling, my chief of \n     staff, who took all the photographs and videotaped the trip.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/22/senate-section/article/S1361-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1361-S1362]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REAUTHORIZATION FUNDING\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes in \nmorning business to speak about my priorities this year in Federal \ntransportation funding. I think all Senators are probably aware that \nCongress must reauthorize the 6-year surface transportation bill in \n2003.\n  As I travel around my State, I continue to hear frequently from \ncitizens about the need to improve our basic transportation \ninfrastructure, including highways and transit. Access to a high-\nquality transportation system is an essential element in economic \ndevelopment, and I believe the Federal Government has an important role \nto play in helping communities build and maintain the basic \ntransportation infrastructure that businesses need.\n  Thus, the reauthorization this year of Federal transportation funding \nwill be essential if New Mexico is to have the high-quality \ntransportation system it needs to attract new jobs and businesses to \nour State. Safe and efficient highways and public transit are \nespecially important for economic developments in the rural parts of my \nState. Basic transportation infrastructure is also vital to our \ncommunities, schools, and families, and helps support everyday life.\n  The most recent 6-year transportation act, known as TEA-21, was \nenacted in 1998. TEA-21 has been a good piece of legislation for my \nState, and I was pleased to support the bill. One of the key \nimprovements Congress made in 1998 was to establish a firewall that, \nfor the first time, ensured all tax receipts deposited in the Highway \ntrust fund were fully used each year for transportation projects.\n  Under TEA-21, New Mexico has made substantial progress in upgrading \nkey highways and transit programs in both urban and rural areas all \nacross the State. As a result of the higher Federal highway funding \nprovided under the act, in the past 6 years New Mexico has been able to \ncomplete a number of much-needed transportation projects.\n  For example, Highway 285 was upgraded to four lanes between Carlsbad \nand Interstate 40; US 550 is now four lanes all the way from Bernalillo \nto Bloomfield; the Big I in Albuquerque was completely rebuilt; US 54 \nis now four-lanes between El Paso and Tularosa; and the Santa Fe bypass \nwas opened. In addition, US 70 will soon be upgraded to four lanes from \nLas Cruces to Texico, and work is now underway to upgrade US 84/285 \nbetween Santa Fe and Poloaque. I do believe each of these projects will \ncontribute significantly to improving highway safety and efficiency in \nmy State.\n  TEA-21 has also helped New Mexico improve transit services both in \nour cities and in rural areas. A number of communities have been able \nto obtain new transit vehicles and equipment with grants from the \nFederal Transit Administration. For example, the Alvarado transit \ncenter was opened in Albuquerque and Federal funds have been used to \npurchase new transit equipment and facilities in communities including \nAlbuquerque, Santa Fe, Las Cruces, Rio Rancho, Farmington, Taos, Angel \nFire, Carlsbad, Clovis, and Los Lunas. In addition, Albuquerque \ninitiated a study of a new high-capacity transportation system, and \nsteps are being taken to preserve the Santa-Fe-to-El-Dorado rail line \nfor future use.\n  Throughout its history, New Mexico has played a key role in the \ntransportation system of this country. The original Spanish settlers \nestablished the Camino Real between Santa Fe and Mexico City. In the \nlast century, our Nation's first transcontinental highway, Route 66, \npassed through New Mexico.\n  Today, New Mexico continues to provide a critical link in our \nNation's interstate and international transportation network, including \ntrade with Mexico. However, we are a State with limited financial \nresources to deal with the transportation needs of what is essentially \nour portion of a vast national system.\n  Mr. President, in total land area New Mexico is the fifth largest \nstate in the Union, but we have only 0.6 percent of the national \npopulation. At the same time, New Mexico has over 2 percent of the \ninterstate highway system miles and slightly less than 2 percent of the \ntotal miles on the national highway system. Moreover, because of our \nvast land area and predominantly rural character, New Mexicans average \nmore miles of driving per capita than the residents of every other \nState but one.\n  Clearly, in light of its size and vast network of roads, the \ntransportation needs of my State far outstrip the ability of New \nMexico's sparse population to provide the funds needed to maintain and \nimprove the State's critical piece of the national transportation \nsystem.\n  Consequently, my top priority in the reauthorization of the highway \nbill will be to ensure that New Mexico receives its fair share of \nFederal transportation dollars for both highways and transit programs. \nThe majority of the funding in the transportation bill is distributed \ndirectly to States and local governments under congressionally set \nformulas. I will be working to make sure the new formulae fully reflect \nNew Mexico's transportation needs, including our extensive miles of \nimportant national roads and highways.\n  Mr. President, another of my top priorities in the reauthorization \nwill be to continue a number of the critical programs in TEA-21 that \ngreatly benefit New Mexico. Two of these important programs are the \nCongestion Mitigation and Air Quality program, known as CMAQ, and the \nEnhancements program, both of which help manage some of the negative \nimpacts of transportation on our communities.\n  At the same time, I will oppose efforts to weaken rules that protect \nthe environment. I will also oppose attempts to limit the ability of \nlocal communities to participate in the planning and development of \ntransportation projects that affect them.\n  In addition, I fully support reauthorizing the Scenic Byways program \nthat helps communities in New Mexico enhance facilities for visitors \ntraveling our rural highways. New Mexico now has 27 scenic byways, \nincluding six that have achieved the designation of National Scenic \nByways.\n  I also believe we should continue to make progress in improving the \nsafety of our highways as well as in reducing the staggering number of \ntraffic fatalities and injures caused by drunk drivers. I will be \nlooking for ways to strengthen both of these important Federal programs \nwhen Congress debates the bill this year.\n  In addition to supporting the continuation of a number of important \nprograms already in TEA-21, I will be authoring a series of bills that \nI hope the Senate will include in the final reauthorization bill.\n  First, I will reintroduce my bill to authorize a new Federal program \nto upgrade rural two-lane roads on the national highway system to four-\nlane highways. This $1.8 million, 6-year national program targets funds \nto four-lane roads in New Mexico such as US 64/87 between Clayton and \nRaton, US 54 from Tularosa to Nara Visa, US 62/180 south of Carlsbad, \nand US 666 south of Shiprock.\n\n[[Page S1362]]\n\n  Second, I will introduce legislation to extend and expand the Indian \nReservation Roads Program, which is so important to Indian communities \nin New Mexico. This program provides direct funding to tribes in 33 \nstates to improve transportation. My bill increase the annual funding \nfor tribal roads from $275 million to $500 million, reestablishes a \nseparate $15 million per-year program to repair bridges on tribal \nlands, and dedicates $20 million per year in new Federal funding for \ntribal transit projects.\n  Third, I will introduce legislation to establish a new University \nTechnology Center at New Mexico State University in collaboration with \nthe University of Oklahoma and Oklahoma State University. The focus of \nthe new center is on nondestructive methods to measure the wear and \ntear on highway bridges.\n  Fourth, I will reintroduce a bill to designate US Highway 54 between \nEl Paso, Texas, and Wichita, Kansas, as the SPIRIT High Priority \nCorridor on the national highway system. In New Mexico, the route runs \nfor about 350 miles from the southern border with Texas, through \nAlamogordo, Carrizozo, Vaughn, Santa Rosa, and Tucumcari, to Nara Visa. \nThis designation will help focus attention on the need to upgrade this \nheavily traveled highway to four lanes. The bill was cosponsored last \nyear by Senators Roberts, Inhofe, Hutchison, and Domenici.\n  Fifth, I will introduce legislation to reauthorize the special \nfunding that goes directly to San Juan and McKinley Counties in New \nMexico, as well as neighboring counties in Arizona and Utah, to help \nmaintain roads used by school buses on the Navajo Reservation. In TEA-\n21, Congress provided $1.5 million per year for 6 years to counties in \nthe three States to help ensure that buses carrying children to school \nhave passable roads. It is not acceptable when Indian children can't \nattend school simply because their school buses couldn't get through on \nthe many poor quality roads in the region.\n  Sixth, I will reintroduce my bill to authorize Los Alamos National \nLaboratory to continue its advanced computer-modeling project to \ndevelop the National Transportation Modeling and Analysis Program, or \nNATMAP. The program will provide a valuable tool for analyzing the \nnational transportation system, including cars, trucks, railroads, \nbarges and airplanes, as a single integrated system. The program will \nalso be valuable in assessing the impacts of disruptions to any portion \nof the transportation network.\n  I hope each of these bills will gain bipartisan support and will be \nincluded in the comprehensive 6-year reauthorization bill. I will have \nmore to say about each of these six initiatives over the next few weeks \nas the bills are introduced.\n  Finally, one of the other important parts of the transportation bill \nis the authorization of funding for individual high-priority highway \nand transit projects around the State. In 1998, I helped secure funding \nfor a number of highway projects throughout New Mexico, including \nupgrades of highways 84/285 and 70, Unser Boulevard, Paseo del Norte, \nand the uptown and northwest areas of Albuquerque and Rio Rancho.\n  This year, some of the projects for which I intend to pursue funding \ninclude reconstruction of the access road from Interstate 40 to the \nDouble Eagle II airport in anticipation of the relocation of Eclipse \nAviation; construction of a new Paseo del Volcan on the northwest side \nof Albuquerque and Rio Rancho; reconstruction of the I-40 and Coors \nBoulevard interchange; construction of a new interchange on Interstate \n25 to serve Mesa del Sol; and expansion of the I-25 interchange in \nBelen.\n  In the rural areas of New Mexico, I will be seeking Federal funding \nto complete four-lane upgrades of the Ports-to-Plains corridor along US \n64/87 between Clayton and Raton, US 54 from Tularosa to Nara Visa, US \n62/180 south of Carlsbad, and US 666 south of Shiprock.\n  For transit projects, one of my priorities will be an authorization \nfor the design and construction of a high-capacity transit corridor in \nAlbuquerque. This effort was first initiated in 1998. The project has \nnow been through the required preliminary studies and is ready to move \nforward with preliminary design for either a light-rail system or a \nsystem with dedicated bus lanes. In addition, I will be seeking an \nauthorization to continue efforts to preserve the Santa Fe El Dorado \nrail line as a possible commuter route.\n  In addition to funding for my priority highway and transit projects, \na large number of additional projects will be funded directly by the \nState and local governments with formula grants funds provided under \nthe 6-year transportation bill.\n  I know reauthorizing the transportation bill is a massive effort. A \nnumber of committees here in the Senate will be involved, including the \nFinance Committee where I am a member. I look forward to working this \nyear with the Environment and Public Works Committee, including \nChairman Inhofe and Senator Jeffords, on the highway programs in the \nbill, and with the Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, \nincluding Chairman Shelby and Senator Sarbanes, on the transit portion \nof this important legislation.

Mr. President, included in the omnibus bill is a \nprovision I authored permitting the use of fiscal year 2003 foreign \noperations funds to support the advancement of democracy and human \nrights in Iran. While I believe that Iran rightly belongs in the Axis \nof Evil, I also recognize that the people of Iran, those residing in \nthe country and abroad, are growing increasingly weary of the \nrepression imposed upon them by Iran's ruling clerics.\n  We all know how these clerics came to power, and today, many \nAmericans appreciate the demographic changes underway in that country. \nTo put it simply, with each new birth in Iran, the popularity and \ncontrol of the regime is further undermined. An estimated 50 percent of \nIran's 70 million people were born after our compatriots were held \nhostage for 444 days. The call of the clerics is falling on \nincreasingly deaf ears, and Iran's youth are already in the streets \ndemanding good governance, accountability, and economic opportunity \nfrom Iranian hardliners.\n  The ingredients for political and economic change in Iran already \nexist. Our task must be to consider how best to support these efforts. \nI propose worthwhile endeavors include funding for Iranian newscasts, \npublication of Iranian political journals, development of websites, and \ndissemination of information on democracy, the concepts of nonviolent \nstruggle, and secularism.\n  As I am familiar with democracy programs that have been implemented \nin other parts of the world, including the former Yugoslavia and Burma, \nI am well aware of the challenges posed in funding democracy and human \nrights programs in Iran. But I am confident that it can be done.\n  I will have more to say on this topic at a later date, but I \nappreciate the attention of my colleagues on this important issue.\n  Let me close by thanking Jennifer Chartrand for her five years of \nservice with the Foreign Operations Subcommittee. Jennifer left earlier \nthis year to work with the Defense Subcommittee, and she will be \nmissed. In addition to managing her accounts in a professional and \neffective manner, Jennifer deserves special recognition for helping the \npeople of Burma in their struggle for democracy and human rights. As \nthis is a cause close to my heart, I am particularly grateful for all \nher hard work on this issue. I wish Jennifer all the best in her new \nposition, and I look forward to continue to work with her in her new \ncapacity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/22/senate-section/article/S1362-2", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1362-S1363]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             A CENTENNIAL SALUTE TO THE SALT RIVER PROJECT\n\n  Mr. McCain. Mr. President, as this Congress deals with the large and \ncomplex challenges facing our Nation in the 21st century, we do well to \nremember local histories and the great public endeavors of our people \nthat have helped make America great.\n  In my home State of Arizona, we remember and celebrate the vision and \ncommitment that, 100 years ago on February 7, launched an organization \nthat helped a great metropolis bloom in the desert.\n\n[[Page S1363]]\n\n  A century ago, the Salt River Project (SRP) was formed by settlers to \nsustain central Arizona's small farming communities through times of \ndrought, flooding, and heat. Through the SRP, with the assistance of \nthe Federal Government, many people worked to build the great Theodore \nRoosevelt Dam which sits on the Salt River, east of the Phoenix \nmetropolitan area.\n  The dam, completed a year before statehood, stood as the largest \nmasonry dam of its day. It provided the lifegiving water and flood \nprotection that enabled downstream communities to flourish and grow.\n  People of all walks and faiths, including Native Americans and \nimmigrant Italian stonemasons, helped build the roads, pack the mules, \ndrive the wagons, and carve the great blocks that created Roosevelt \nDam. In 1911, Teddy Roosevelt, then years past his final term, came to \nArizona to dedicate the dam and the great labors that made the project \na reality.\n  The water supplies assured by the structure nurtured a growing \neconomy, and hydroelectric facilities were developed to power our \ngrowth. The dam crated Roosevelt Lake, a major conservation and \nrecreational resource enjoyed by so many of our residents and visitors.\n  Over the years through the SFP's efforts, other water storage \nfacilities were constructed helping to provide the water, power, flood \ncontrol, conservation and recreation that sustains our communities and \none of the Nation's most vibrant economies.\n  Today, the SRP serves some 780,000 electric customers and supplies \nwater to more than 1.5 million people. It is the Nation's oldest multi-\npurpose reclamation project, the largest water supplier in central \nArizona and a major public power utility, helping to sustain a quality \nof life and economic vigor of which Arizonans are richly proud.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is with pleasure that I offer this tribute to the \nSalt River Project and the people it represents. Arizona looks forward \nto a future for the SRP that is as successful as its past and to \nensuring that our great public works continue to serve the best \ninterests of our great people in the hundred years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/22/senate-section/article/S1363-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1363]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. In the last Congress Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Act, a bill that would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence \nof any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred June 17, 2001 \nin Springfield, MO. An African-American man, Maurice Wilson, was \nstabbed three times by one of six men whom witnesses described as \nskinheads and white supremacists. Police said the stabbing appeared to \nbe racially motivated. The victim had walked into a diner with his \ngirlfriend, who is white, and another interracial couple. A fight \nensued between the victim and the group of alleged white supremacists \nwhen one of the group pulled out a knife and stabbed the victim.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/22/senate-section/article/S1363-2", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1363]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    30TH ANNIVERSARY OF ROE V. WADE\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the 30th \nanniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision.\n  Thirty years ago, in 1973, the U.S. Supreme Court held that women \nhave a constitutional right to an abortion. That decision, Roe v. Wade, \nwas carefully crafted to be both balanced and responsible while holding \nthe rights of women in America paramount in reproductive decisions. Roe \nv. Wade held that women have a constitutional right to an abortion, but \nafter viability, States can ban abortions as long as they allow \nexceptions when a woman's life or health is endangered. Since then, \nwhile the Court has consistently ruled in favor of this right, there is \nno doubt that this right is being eroded.\n  And today, the thirtieth anniversary of that landmark decision, I \nespecially want to thank those who are continuing to provide safe and \nlegal reproductive health care to the women of our community. In the \nface of crippling challenges, especially violence and threats of \nviolence, these health care workers have held fast in their commitment \nto provide the quality health care that all women deserve.\n  Like most Americans, I believe that we must work to reduce the number \nof unwanted pregnancies through education and family planning. But I \nalso believe that our Constitution protects a woman's right to privacy, \nand that this constitutional right encompasses the decision of whether \nto terminate a pregnancy.\n  Unfortunately, we are seeing a concerted effort by those who seek to \noverturn this right to stack our courts with ideological conservatives \nwho seek not only to weaken the right to make personal decisions about \none's own body, but also to make exercising that right a criminal \noffense. As a Senator, I take my responsibility to advise and consent \non nominees to the Federal judiciary extremely seriously. While I \nrecognize the privilege of the President to select his nominees, I \nbelieve it is critical that we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of \neach nominee, since, unlike members of the President's cabinet and \nother executive branch appointees, Federal judges receive lifetime \nappointments, and are expected to interpret our Nation's laws in a fair \nand balanced manner.\n  I am especially concerned that President Bush has chosen to \nrenominate several extremists on this issue, especially Priscilla Owen. \nHer record demonstrates that, as a member of the strongly conservative \nTexas Supreme Court, she was an activist judge, interpreting the law to \nfit her ideological ends. Indeed, while President Bush's current White \nHouse Counsel was serving on the Texas Supreme Court, then-Justice \nAlberto Gonzales called one of her rulings ``an unconscionable act of \njudicial activism.''\n  Many of my colleagues and I spend much of our time, and must continue \nto do so, defending the actual right to have an abortion. But in my \nmind, the easiest way to reduce the number of abortions is to prevent \nunwanted pregnancies in the first place. And I simply don't understand \nwhy so many anti-choice members don't understand that connection.\n  Studies show that the use of family planning reduces the probability \nof a woman having an abortion by 85 percent. Unfortunately, the U.S. \nstill has 3 million unintended pregnancies each year in the United \nStates, half of which end in abortion. This is why I support the Equity \nin Prescription Contraceptive Coverage Act, authored by Senator Olympia \nSnowe of Maine, and why I will be cosponsoring that bill when she \nreintroduces it.\n  The women in the Senate are in a unique position to fight against the \nerosion of Roe. I stand with them today to honor those who came before \nme in fighting for this right. Together we will continue to make sure \nthat the women of America have the right to privacy, and the \nfundamental freedom of choice in our lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/22/senate-section/article/S1363-3", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1363-S1364]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  CONGRATULATIONS ON THE RETIREMENT OF MAJOR GENERAL GORDON E. STUMP, \n            ADJUTANT GENERAL OF THE MICHIGAN NATIONAL GUARD\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, January 31 of this year will be the \nlast day that MG Gordon E. Stump serves as the head of the Michigan \nNational Guard. This will bring to a close the tenure of the longest \nserving adjutant general in the Nation. For 12 years, GEN Stump has \nembodied the pride, professionalism and dedication that is the hallmark \nof the citizen soldiers of the National Guard.\n  Increasingly, our Nation's military relies on the men and women of \nthe National Guard and Reserve to serve seamlessly alongside of our \nactive duty military. The ability of these citizen soldiers to pick up, \nleave their families and serve where they are needed is a tribute to \nthem and to the ability of\n\n[[Page S1364]]\n\ntheir leadership to prepare them for service. It is because of the \ndynamic leadership and vision of men and women like GEN Stump that our \nNational Guard is able to operate with such professionalism.\n  Since I have had the pleasure of first working with GEN Stump, I have \nwitnessed a man who had a clear vision for the future of the Michigan \nNational Guard. To that end, he has tirelessly worked to improve the \ntools available to the soldiers under his command. He has worked to \nimprove their hardware, facilities and training opportunities, and he \nhas achieved success in each of these efforts. Today, the Michigan Army \nGuard possesses the UH-60 Black Hawk instead of the Vietnam era Huey \nCobra helicopter. Additionally, airlift capacity has been enhanced with \nthe addition of C-130 aircraft, F-16s have been upgraded with the \naddition of Litening targeting pods, and the Multiple Launch Rocket \nSystem is now available for use by the soldiers of the Michigan \nNational Guard.\n  In just over a decade, GEN Stump has upgraded Michigan's Guard \nfacilities by securing $179 million in military construction funds that \nhave been used for 32 projects throughout Michigan. Among these \nfacilities is Selfridge Air National Guard Base, ANGB, a unique base \nbecause it is the only Air National Guard facility in the United States \nwith all the branches of the service represented on the base. This is \nalso the base where GEN Stump maintained his aeronautical skills and \nbecame qualified as an F-16 pilot.\n  Under GEN Stump's leadership, Michigan became one of 23 States to \nparticipate in the Department of Defense's State Partnership program \nthat paired States with nations that were once part of the former \nSoviet Union. These partnerships sought to teach the militaries of \nthese nations about the standards required by members of the North \nAtlantic Treaty Organization, NATO.\n  GEN Stump worked to develop the Michigan Youth Challenge program, a \nprogram that works with at-risk youth enabling them to earn their \ngeneral equivalency diploma while enabling them to develop the skills \nneeded to succeed in life. Additionally, GEN Stump was able to work \nwith the State of Michigan to initiate a program with 18 colleges and \nuniversities in the State that coupled with the Montgomery GI Bill, \nvirtually guarantees a free education for Michigan guard members. These \nprograms have resulted in a manning increase from 84 percent to over 99 \npercent for the Michigan National Guard.\n  All of these efforts have paid important dividends for Michigan and \nthe Nation. The Michigan National Guard has participated in over 10 \nDepartment of Defense missions including Operations Desert Shield, \nDesert Storm, Joint Endeavor, Noble Eagle, and Enduring Freedom. Forces \nhave also been provided to the 1996 Summer Olympics, humanitarian \nmissions throughout the world, and disaster relief efforts in Michigan. \nIn the days and months following September 11, residents of Michigan \nsaw the Michigan National Guard come to the aid of their fellow \ncitizens. Guard members protected key sites, assisted at airports and \naided Customs officials with their duties along the northern border \nbetween the United States and Canada. Their hard work helped our Nation \nremain secure and maintain the free flow of commerce between both \nnations.\n  GEN Stump's leadership has been recognized by his peers. He has been \nappointed to serve on the Reserve Forces Policy Board, the Adjutant \nGenerals Association, and for the past 2 years as the president of the \nNational Guard Association of the United States. GEN Stump has left an \nindelible impression upon the Michigan National Guard. I look forward \nto working with his successor, GEN Thomas Cutler, and I know that the \nnew Adjutant General of Michigan will agree with me that his job has \nbeen made easier because of the hard work and dedication of GEN Stump. \nI commend GEN Gordon E. Stump for his long and distinguished career of \nservice to the United States Air Force, the Michigan National Guard, \nand his Nation, and I know my Senate colleagues will join me in wishing \nhim well in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/22/senate-section/article/S1364-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1364]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          HONORING ELSIE MEEKS\n\n Mr. JOHNSON.

Established by Congress in 1976, the \nConsumer Advisory Council advises the Federal Reserve Board on the \nexercise of its duties under the consumer credit protection laws and on \nother consumer-related matters, representing the interests both of \nconsumers and the financial community.\n  Elsie's numerous accomplishments are remarkable. An enrolled member \nof the Oglala Lakota Tribe, she helped develop and was Executive \nDirector of the Lakota Fund, a Native American community development \nfinancial institution on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South \nDakota. Co-owner of the Long Creek Grocery in Wanblee, she received the \ndistinguished ``South Dakota Minority Small Business Advocate of the \nYear'' award. In 1998 Elsie was nominated for Lieutenant Governor, \nbecoming the first Native American woman nominated by a major party on \na gubernatorial ticket in South Dakota. She was appointed by Senator \nDaschle in 1999 to serve as the first Native American on the U.S. \nCommission on Civil Rights.\n  Currently, Elsie is a board member of the National Community Capital \nAssociation and is the Executive Director of First Nations Oweesta \nCorporation, a subsidiary corporation of First Nations Development \nInstitute, which provides technical assistance and training for the \ndevelopment and expansion of Native American community development \nfinancial institutions.\n  It is an honor for me to share Elsie's accomplishments with my \ncolleagues and to publicly commend her for honorably serving South \nDakota and the Nation. This prestigious honor is a reflection of her \nextraordinary service, commitment, and unwavering dedication to the \nNative American community. She will be a tremendous asset to the \nConsumer Advisory Council. Her accomplishments serve as a wonderful \nexample for other hard-working and dedicated South Dakotans to emulate. \nOn behalf of all South Dakotans, I would like to congratulate Elsie and \nwish her continued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/22/senate-section/article/S1364-2", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1364]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              KIWANIS CLUB OF HASBROUCK HEIGHTS-TETERBORO\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG.

On January 20, The American Jewish Committee Institute of Human \nRelations Award Dinner will honor John L. McGoldrick. Since 1979, John \nMcGoldrick has served as a director of the New Jersey Transit \nCorporation, which is the United States' third largest passenger rail \nand bus company. As anyone from New Jersey knows, passenger rail and \nbus service is extremely important to the commerce and quality of life \nin our State.\n  Currently John McGoldrick is executive vice president of Bristol-\nMyers Squibb Company. He is vice chairman of the company's executive \ncommittee and is responsible for Global Corporate\n\n[[Page S1365]]\n\nPolicy.

A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nincrease the floor for treatment as an extremely low DSH State to 3 \npercent in fiscal year 2003; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nwith Senators Enzi, Lincoln, Baucus, Smith, Harkin, Domenici, Johnson, \nNelson of Nebraska, and Dayton entitled the ``Medicaid Safety Net \nImprovement Act of 2003.'' This legislation is important to the \ncontinued survival of many of our Nation's safety\n\n[[Page S1371]]\n\nnet hospitals that provide critical health care access to our Nation's \n41.2 million uninsured citizens, including 373,000 in New Mexico, \nthrough the Medicaid disproportionate share hospital, or DSH, program.\n  In recognition of the burden certain hospitals bear in providing a \nlarge share of health services to the low-income patients, including \nMedicaid and the uninsured, the Congress established the Medicaid DSH \nprogram in the mid-1980's to give additional funding to support such \n``disproportionate share'' hospitals. By providing financial relief to \nthese hospitals, the Medicaid DSH program maintains hospital access for \nthe poor. As the National Governors' Association has said, ``Medicaid \nDSH's funds are an important part of statewide systems of health care \naccess for the uninsured.''\n  Recent reports by the Institute of Medicine entitled ``America's \nHealth Care Safety Net: Infact But Endangered,'' the National \nAssociation of Public Hospitals entitled ``The Dependence of Safety Net \nHospitals'' and the Commonwealth Fund entitled ``A Shared \nResponsibility: Academic Health Centers and the Provision of Care to \nthe Poor and Uninsured'' have all highlighted the importance of the \nMedicaid DSH program to our health care safety net.\n  Unfortunately, as the Commonwealth Fund report notes, ``. . . there \nare large inequities in how these funds are distributed among states.'' \nIn fact, for a number of states, including New Mexico, our federal DSH \nallotments are not allowed to exceed 1 percent of our state's Medicaid \nprogram costs. In comparison, the average state spends around 9 percent \nof its Medicaid funding on DSH. This disparity and lack of Medicaid DSH \nin ``extremely low-DSH states'' threatens the viability of our safety \nnet providers. In New Mexico, these funds are critical but inadequate \nto hospitals all across our state, including University Hospital, \nEastern New Mexico Regional Hospital, Lea Regional Hospital, Plains \nRegional Medical Center, Memorial Medical Center, and others.\n  In an analysis of the Medicaid DSH program by the Urban Institute, \nthe total amount of federal Medicaid DSH payments in six States was \nless than $1 per Medicaid and uninsured individual compared to five \nStates than had DSH spending in excess of $500 per Medicaid and \nuninsured individual. That figure was just $14.91 per Medicaid and \nuninsured person in New Mexico. Compared to the average expenditure of \n$218.96 across the country, such disparities cannot be sustained.\n\n  As a result, this bipartisan legislation increases the allowed \nFederal Medicaid DSH allotment in the ``extremely low-DSH states'' from \n1 percent to 3 percent of Medicaid program costs, which remains far \nless, or just about one-third, of the national average. The 18 States \nthat would benefit from this legislation include: Alaska, Arkansas, \nDelaware, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, \nNew Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, \nWisconsin, and Wyoming. I would add that the legislation does not \nimpact the Federal DSH allotments in other States but only seeks \ngreater equity by raising the share of Federal funds to ``extremely \nlow-DSH States.''\n  Once again, the Commonwealth Fund recommends such action. As the \nreport finds, ``States with small DSH programs are not permitted to \nincrease the relative size of their DSH programs . . . [C]urrent policy \nsimply rewards the programs that acted quickly and more aggressively, \nwithout regard to a State's real need of such funds.'' Therefore, the \nreport concludes, ``. . . greater equity in the use of Federal funds \nshould be established among States.''\n  Again, this is achieved in our legislation by raising the limits for \n``extremely low-DSH States'' from 1 percent to 3 percent and not by \nredistributing or taking money away from other States.\n  Failure to support these critical hospitals could have a devastating \nimpact not only on the low-income and vulnerable populations who depend \non them for care but also on other providers throughout the communities \nthat rely on the safety net to care for patients whom they are unable \nor unwilling to serve.\n  As the Institute of Medicine's report entitled ``America's Health \nCare Safety Net: Intact But Endangered'' states, ``Until the nation \naddresses the underlying problems that make the health care safety net \nsystem necessary, it is essential that national, State, and local \npolicy makers protect and perhaps enhance the ability of these \ninstitutions and providers to carry out their missions.''\n  I would like to thank Senators Baucus and Grassley, the leaders of \nthe Senate Finance Committee, for their recognition of this problem and \ninclusion of this language in several bills they introduced in the last \nCongress, S. 3018, ``Beneficiary Access to Care and Medicare Equity Act \nof 2002'' and S. 2873, ``Improving Our Well-Being Act of 2002.''\n  Our Nation's governors remain very concerned as well. In a letter \nwritten to Senators Baucus and Grassley on October 23, 2002, the \ngovernors of the States of Arkansas, Idaho, Iowa, Nebraska, New Mexico, \nUtah, Wisconsin, and Minnesota wrote, ``Our 15, which is now 18, States \nare in distress and cannot wait another year for some measure of \nrelief. We strongly urge you to use any vehicle available to include \nthe low-DSH issue. The States are seeking to raise the cap implemented \ntwo years ago from 1 percent to 3 percent to provide them some \nflexibility in addressing the increasing strain facing our safety net \nhospitals.''\n  The governors add, ``The survival of many community hospitals, the \nlifeline for many rural community's health care and economy in our \nStates, are being threatened. Current disparities in DSH funding \nseverely harm our States' most vulnerable safety net hospitals.''\n  At a time of growing numbers of uninsured and increased financial \nstrain on our Nation's safety net, we need to increase the ability of \n``extremely low-DSH States'' to address the problems facing their \nsafety net and to reduce the current inequity in funding among the \nStates.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 204\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the \nSenate completes its business today, it stand in adjournment until 10 \na.m. Thursday, January 23. I further ask that following the prayer and \nthe pledge, the morning hour be deemed to have expired, the Journal of \nproceedings be approved to date, the time for the two leaders be \nreserved for their use later in the day, and there then be a period of \nmorning business until 10:45 a.m., with the time equally divided, and \nSenators be permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each. \nFurther, I ask that at 10:45 a.m., the Senate resume consideration of \nH.J. Res. 2, the appropriations bill. I further ask consent that at 11 \na.m., the Senate proceed to a series of votes in relation to the \npending amendments as under the previous order.\n  Finally, I ask consent that there be 2 minutes equally divided for \ndebate prior to each of the stacked votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, this appears to be in order. \nI wanted the opportunity to say we have made great progress today. Both \nleaders have indicated they want to finish this bill tomorrow. That is \npossible, but it is not going to be easy. I note to those on my side of \nthe aisle that we have a number of amendments to be offered tomorrow. \nWe have amendments by Senators Kennedy, Clinton, Bingaman, Cantwell, \nand Senator Boxer may offer an amendment.\n  If there are other Democrats who want to offer amendments, they \nshould contact me. Some of them have worked with the managers, but if \nthey don't let me know they are interested in offering amendments, the \nday is going to go by quickly and they will not have that opportunity. \nSome wanted these amendments listed tonight to be it. I thought in \nfairness to Senators that this may have been misunderstood. We were \nclose to saying the amendments in order were just those I listed \ntonight.\n  I hope tomorrow we can move through the amendments. If we just do \nthese, plus whatever Senator Stevens has--he has 60 or 70 amendments he \nis going to try to clear tomorrow morning, and it is going to call for \na long day. I ask that everybody continue to move forward. From our \nside, I can say that we appreciate the new leader allowing us to offer \namendments, not immediately filing cloture as we believe has happened \nin the past quite a bit. So we are very satisfied with the opportunity \nwe have had to offer amendments, and we hope this is the wave of the \nfuture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Democratic whip and I note \nthat it has gone well. We have covered a lot of territory. People have \nhad the opportunity to present amendments and speak on them and have \nvotes on their amendments. But we have a lot out there, and a lot of \nwork is being done. It would be much to the pleasure of the people on \nthis side if we were able to complete this tomorrow. A lot of effort \nhas gone into the last several days. Senator Stevens is as committed to \ndoing everything he can on this side to work with the leadership on the \nother side of the aisle to bring this matter to a conclusion tomorrow, \nwith everybody having a fair opportunity to speak and vote as they \nchoose.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/22/senate-section/article/S1372-2", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1372]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS.
