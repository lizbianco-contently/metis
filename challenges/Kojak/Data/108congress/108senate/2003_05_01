Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session. The clerk will report the pending \nbusiness.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Priscilla Richmond Owen, \nof Texas, to be United States Circuit Judge for the Fifth Circuit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 1 \nhour of debate divided in the usual form, prior to the vote on the \nnomination of Priscilla Owen to be circuit court judge for the Fifth \nCircuit.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I again thank my colleague for allowing me \nto move forward on this because of a commitment to a markup in the \nCommerce Committee.\n  I rise to express my deep concerns regarding the nomination of \nPriscilla Owen to the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. I have noted \nthere is a lot of politics around this particular nomination, as there \nis around the Miguel Estrada nomination. I read the Republican Party is \nplanning to run ads against those of us who vote against these \nnominees, saying we do not want to see diversity on the bench.\n  Let me say that is extraordinary because as someone who worked so \nhard to support qualified minorities and women, I have been praised by \nmany in my State for doing just that. But I have to tell you, if you \nplace on the bench a minority or a woman who has animosity toward the \ngoals of minorities and women, you are dealing a great setback to both \nminorities and women. I will make that point when I have to.\n  But as for today, I point out I voted for well over 90 percent of the \nPresident's appointees up to this point in time, but I cannot support \nthis nomination. This is why.\n  President Bush pledged to govern from the center. Those were his \nwords. Yet this nominee is so far from the center that she is almost \noff, to the right. She is barely on that line at all. That differs from \nthe mainstream values of my constituents and I believe of the majority \nof Americans.\n  In such important areas as reproductive rights, civil rights, \nconsumer rights, and environmental protection, this nominee has \nlegislated from the bench. She inserted her personal beliefs into the \njudicial process.\n  I have to say even members of her own party, and even Mr. Gonzales, \nwho is White House counsel, has criticized her for that.\n  What is particularly troubling to me is that I believe in the advice \nand consent role of Senators in the nomination and the confirmation of \njudicial nominees of any President, be that President a Democrat or a \nRepublican. As we have heard many times from historians, the selection \nof judges and the confirmation of judges is a shared responsibility. So \nit is not a question of whether they are Clinton judges or Carter \njudges or Bush judges; they are America's judges. As such, there has to \nbe a role for the Senate and for the executive.\n  This President knew very well that this particular nominee was well \noff the center. He knew very well there was deep objection to her. She \nwas voted down once before. Yet he comes right back with this \nnomination.\n  I have made it a priority of mine in this Senate to stand up for the \nmainstream values of people of my State. So I cannot possibly support \nthis nomination. I wish to outline a case that illustrates Priscilla \nOwen's callous attitude toward individuals who are fighting against \nlarge corporate interests and their well-paid legal defense teams.\n  A young man in Texas was paralyzed in a car accident. His injuries \nwere made much worse because of a malfunctioning seatbelt, and his \nfamily took the automaker to court. The case made its way to the Texas \nSupreme Court on appeal.\n  Judge Owen waited 16 months before issuing a decision in that case, \nin that Ford Motor case. When she did, she essentially sent the case \nback and created a substantial roadblock for this paralyzed teenager to \nreceive funds to pay for his medical care. There were 2 years of delay \non a procedure issue that was never raised in the case but was raised \nby her, and this young man died. This young man died. His family \ncouldn't afford around-the-clock monitoring of his ventilator. This is \na truly tragic example of delayed justice.\n\n  I could go into detail about the fundamental right to choose in which \nJustice Owen set up a barrier to a young woman who was seeking to end \nher pregnancy. When she issued her opinion, it dealt with having to \nseek religious counseling, which was not part of the law. In that case, \nJudge Gonzales, who as you know is White House counsel to this \nPresident, said:\n\n       To create hurdles that simply are not to be found in the \n     words of the statute would be an unconscionable act of \n     judicial activism.\n\n  That is a quote from Mr. Gonzales regarding Judge Priscilla Owen, \ncriticizing her for judicial activism.\n  I know the issues of judges are very touchy. Senator Hatch, when \nPresident Clinton was President, told me--he said it with a twinkle in \nhis eye: Senator, don't send me judges that are outside the mainstream.\n  You know, I didn't. Senator Hatch helped me. He helped me get these \nwonderful people confirmed.\n  Now we have a circumstance where we are not getting our judges from \nthe mainstream. We are getting some. I have supported 90 percent of \nthese judges. But in this case----\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I certainly will. I just want to finish my thought.\n  In this particular case, I think this is a nominee who is outside the \nmainstream and who was criticized for that by the President's White \nHouse counsel.\n  I am happy to yield to my friend.\n  Mr. HATCH. Is the Senator aware that there is an ample record that \neven Judge Gonzales admits he was not criticizing her as an activist, \nhe was criticizing the court. She didn't write the opinion. That has \nbeen more than established. Yet we keep hearing Senators on the floor \nof the Senate and elsewhere saying Judge Gonzales directly criticized \nher. He didn't. I think the record is pretty clear on that.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will have printed in the Record my understanding of \nwhat actually happened here.\n  In the case of the 2-year delay, I find that was unconscionable.\n  The point is this: I will support candidates who are from the \nmainstream. I want to do that. The chair of the Judiciary Committee has \nchanged his attitude about who is going to get through this Senate. \nDuring the Clinton years, you had to have someone from the mainstream. \nDuring the Bush years, you can have people from the far right of the \nspectrum. My constituents do not think that is fair. We had a situation \nduring the Clinton years that two Senators had to sign off on a judge \nbefore there would even be a hearing. Oh, no, now the committee has \nchanged its mind. Suddenly, because they have a Republican in the White \nHouse, two Senators don't have to sign off and they are pushing forward \nwith hearings.\n  It is wrong. It is not right. I would say regarding this particular \nnominee, you have very moderate Members of this Senate saying she is a \njudicial activist and any words to the contrary can be disproven by her \nrecord. I think this is someone who does not come from the center, does \nnot come from the mainstream. I think this is a President who, in this \ncase, has not sought the advice and consent, really, of the Senate. He \nis essentially saying we don't care that you Democrats--none of you--\nvote for her. I should not say none--maybe one. Certainly none on the \ncommittee. We are going to go right back and bring her back here.\n  This is a lifetime appointee. I think when we make these types of \nappointments, we have to make sure the person who is being nominated is \nnot going to be an activist, make sure the person has demonstrated the \ntypes of qualities we want on the bench.\n  I don't think it is a quality you want on the bench when a woman \nwaits 2 years before she renders a decision in a case of a paralyzed \nteenager whose parents didn't have the money to keep their teenager on \na ventilator. And the record shows otherwise? I know what the record \nis. We have people combing that record. That is why you are going to \nsee very many women in this Senate take this floor. I will repeat, when \nyou put a woman on the bench who has a\n\n[[Page S5621]]\n\nrecord of not really helping women--I have seen it in this case, and I \nhave seen it with other nominees who will be coming before us. I will \ntake a second seat to no one in the advancement of women. Every time I \nhave sought the support of bipartisan women's groups, I have gotten it \nbecause of that. Anyone who says Democratic women coming here speaking \nup against this nominee are not for women ought to study that record as \nwell.\n  I think the Federal courts deserve better than this nominee. I think \nthe American people deserve better than this nominee. I could go on and \non about the record.\n  Let me briefly outline a case that illustrates Priscilla Owen's \ncallous attitude towards individuals who are facing large corporate \ninterests and their well-paid legal defense teams.\n  A young man in Texas was paralyzed in a car accident. His injuries \nwere made much worse because of a malfunctioning seatbelt. His family \ntook the automaker to court. The case made its way to the Texas Supreme \nCourt on appeal. Justice Owen's unexplained 16-month delay in writing \nthe court's opinion in the Ford Motor Company v. Miles case created a \nsubstantial roadblock for this paralyzed teenager to receive funds to \npay for his medical care. Priscilla Owen was responsible for two of the \nfive years of delay and finally issued a decision that was based on a \nprocedural issue never raised in the case. All of her colleagues on the \ncourt believed she had improperly delayed the case.\n  The young man died approximately seven years after his accident \nbecause his family could no longer afford round-the-clock monitoring of \nhis ventilator. To date, his family has not received any funds. This is \ntruly a tragic example of delayed justice. This is an unprecedented \nattempt to manipulate the Senate's role in the confirmation process. \nThe Judiciary Committee rejected this nominee last year.\n  The committee performed its constitutional rule and voted against \nJustice Owen. However, the White House renominated her to the same \nposition. How could they not have gotten the message the first time?\n  This process makes a mockery out of the Senate's constitutional \n``advice and consent'' role. The blatant disregard of the Senate's \nconstitutional role is leading us into uncharted territory. Let me say \nthis again that Justice Owen was rejected by the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee--10-9 on September 5, 2002. The long list of concerns about \nher record that caused the majority of committee members to vote \nagainst her last year still exist.\n  I have made it a priority in my career to stand up for consumers and \nthose who find themselves up against huge corporate interests. The \npeople of California know all too well how difficult it is to take on \npowerful companies. The playing field is far from balanced.\n  In other areas, Justice Owen has consistently attempted to chip away \nat women's fundamental reproductive rights.\n  In the case of Doe I--2000--Justice Owen argued that a minor must \nmeet a restrictive standard to establish that she is sufficiently well \ninformed about her choice to have an abortion. Among other things, she \nwould have to show that she had received counseling about the religious \narguments surrounding abortion, despite the fact that the law in no way \ninvolves religious considerations.\n  The Texas statute states that a minor need not inform her parents \nbefore seeking an abortion if the court finds one of three things.\n  No. 1, that the minor is mature and sufficiently well informed to \nmake a decision; or\n  No. 2, that parental notifications would not be in her best interest; \nor\n  No. 3, that notification may lead to physical, sexual, or emotional \nabuse.\n  That is all it says.\n  I have to go to a markup. But we can try to rewrite the facts all we \nwant. We can rewrite and put another spin on it. We can say, oh, the \ncriticism wasn't toward her, when in essence my belief is that was her \npoint of view that was being espoused. But that is fine. I understand \nthis is a fight. I am willing to take this fight. I was very proud to \nsay that the people in my State want me to stand up in these situations \nbecause it goes to the heart of the role of the Senate and it goes to \nthe heart of what kind of country we will have. It goes to the heart of \nwhat kind of judges we will have. Will they be compassionate? Will they \nbe fair? Will they stand up for the rights of women? Will they stand up \nfor the little guy against the big corporation? You have to look at \nthis particular record. You are not going to find someone who doesn't.\n  I thank my colleague, Senator Hatch. I know he strongly disagrees \nwith me. I think that is fine. But he is very kind to allow me to go \nfirst so I can go to my hearing for the reauthorization of the FAA.\n  Thank you very much. I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of \nthe Democratic time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have listened to my distinguished \ncolleague. I have to say that if there has been any attempt to rewrite \nthe facts, it is by those who have spoken as my friend from California \nhas.\n  First of all, they seem to think on that side that they advance women \nwhen they only advance women who agree with their particular position. \nThey don't even realize that Priscilla Owen agrees with many of their \npositions as she does with other well-thought-out positions. They think \nthe advancement of women depends only on if you have women who are \ngoing to be pro-abortion.\n  I might add that I don't know where Priscilla Owen is with regard to \nabortion because she has not told me. She has not told the committee \nthat, but she has said what has to be the hallmark of what judgeship \nnominees should say--that she will uphold Roe v. Wade as a court judge, \nwhich is all you can ask of anybody. Regardless of what her personal \nviews are, she is going to uphold it. Yet we hear this argument that \nthey are advancing women because they are keeping a woman who is \nunanimously well qualified by their gold standard--the American Bar \nAssociation, which is not a conservative organization by any stretch of \nthe imagination--they are keeping her from serving this country. They \ncontinue to misquote Judge Gonzales as though he was directly attacking \nPriscilla Owen when he himself admits he was not--and other judges from \nthat Supreme Court of the State of Texas say he was not.\n  Senator Cornyn, who served with her and was sitting beside her, said \nthose criticisms weren't directed directly at her. That is distortion. \nIt is unworthy of this body. But it is going on all the time.\n\n  On the tort case--I know the distinguished Senator from Texas is \nhere, and I will yield to her as soon as she is ready--they bring up \nagain the distortion that she held a case up until this young boy died. \nLet me make some important observations about the majority opinion \nJustice Owen wrote in Ford Motor Company v. Miles because I think there \nhas been some serious confusion about the case and it is very apparent \nthat the distinguished Senator from California is confused. This is the \ncase involving a car accident victim named Willie Searcy who, \ntragically, passed away years after his accident but before the \nlitigation was resolved. I have addressed this issue over and over. But \nit looks as if I must go through it again.\n  The accusation was once made that the victim passed away before the \nTexas Supreme Court ruled on his appeal. Justice Owen more than set the \nrecord straight last July. The victim passed away 3 years after the \nopinion was issued. Yet we hear this again on the floor.\n  When are the Democrats going to quit distorting President Bush's \nnominee's record?\n  I have to admit that I used to think this was--well, just \ninteresting. But it has gone on and on. And after you show them the \nfacts, they still distort it. I would have thought that issue moot \nbecause the opinion was issued 3 years before he died. But some \ninterest groups continue to make this allegation in spite of the facts. \nI suspect that the New York Times just copies the letters in the \neditorials of People for the American Way. It is unbelievable.\n  The allegation was made that Justice Owen's opinion was improper \nbased on the issue of venue; in other words, the question of whether \nplaintiff's lawyers filed the case in the county that didn't have \njurisdiction over the dispute.\n\n[[Page S5622]]\n\nSome allege that this issue had not been raised by the parties in the \nlower courts. Again, Justice Owen set the record straight in no \nuncertain terms. The venue issue was properly considered in the Texas \nSupreme Court. The entire court agreed that it was appropriate for the \ncourt to resolve the venue issue.\n  Again, they are wrong, and they are distorting this case.\n  I don't think there is any reason for that type of distortion. We \nhave explained it over and over. Justice Owen was more than clear. Yet \nthey are smearing this judge who has the highest rating of the American \nBar Association--unanimously well qualified. That doesn't happen very \noften.\n  It must also be emphasized that under Texas law the court was \nrequired to address the issue of venue. The court found that the case \nwas filed in the wrong venue. It was required to reverse the verdict. \nIt had no other option. The Texas statute governing this issue read:\n\n       On appeal from the trial on the merits, if venue was \n     improper, it shall in no event be harmless error and shall be \n     reversible error.\n\n  In other words, the court must reverse if improper venue is found.\n  In all honesty, to ensure there is no confusion about the problem \nwith venue, let me say there was no question but that Dallas County was \nthe proper place to bring the suit because the plaintiffs lived there, \nbought their truck there, and that is where the accident took place. \nInexplicably, the lawyers filed in another county, Russ County--having \nabsolutely no connection whatsoever to the plaintiffs or the accident. \nIt looked like forum shopping--something that should not be permitted \nby the courts, under any circumstances, no matter how badly a person \nmight have been injured.\n\n  If we read between the lines, we can see that the lawyers were forum \nshopping--looking for a favorable jury--something that should not be \nallowed by any court in this land, especially when it is clear cut that \nthe venue was in Dallas County.\n  It must also be noted that the court's decision did not prevent the \ncase from being filed in Dallas County or refiled.\n  I am a little tired of the smearing of these nominees. I am not \nsaying intentional smearing, although it is reaching that point when \nyou have to say over and over, when the justice explained herself and \nmade it so abundantly clear, and we have made it over and over \nourselves, and the record is so doggone clear. Why would we have, time \nafter time, people coming out here saying they are advancing the cause \nof women by smearing this woman justice and keeping her from serving \nher country on the circuit court of appeals?\n  One last thing: The Senator also complained because she has objected \nto another nominee when we have the blue slip back from the other \nSenator from the State. There has never been a rule, since Senator \nKennedy was the chairman of the committee and was the one who \nestablished the rule that I followed, that says a single Senator can \nstop a circuit court of appeals nominee of the President of the United \nStates.\n  Senator Kennedy's ruling, even with regard to district courts, was \nthat the opinions of the Senators with regard to blue slips will have \ngreat weight, but they will not be dispositive, especially where there \nis no reason for the withholding of a blue slip. And in this case, \nthere is basically no reasoning, and in this other case of Carolyn \nKuhl.\n  So I want to set the record straight there. No President would agree \nto, and this Senate should not agree to, one solitary Senator, for \npolitical reasons, refusing to return a blue slip on a circuit court of \nappeals court nominee where that circuit court of appeals nominee, once \non the court, will be representing the whole country, but, of course, \nall the States in that particular circuit.\n  I notice the distinguished Senator from Texas is in the Chamber, so I \nwill yield----\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Up to 10 minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. Up to 10 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Texas. \nI will continue my remarks afterwards.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President. And I thank the chairman \nfor yielding time to me to talk about someone I know well, someone I \nhave observed over the years, and who is one of the most outstanding \npeople I have ever seen nominated for a Federal bench. She is a legal \nscholar. She has the temperament for a judge. And I think nothing shows \nher temperament better than her demeanor during the ordeal through \nwhich she has been put.\n  She has been held up since May 9, 2001. She has had two hearings--not \none--in which she was grilled by members of the Judiciary Committee, \nand she came out spotlessly clean. And even Members who today are going \nto vote against her have said she is one of the most qualified legal \nscholars they have seen before their committee. In fact, I have to say, \nI think there are a number of Democrats who really think she should be \nconfirmed, but they are being held back by the special interest groups \nand the pressures not to confirm this qualified woman.\n  Justice Priscilla Owen is an 8-year veteran of the Texas Supreme \nCourt. She graduated cum laude from Baylor Law School. She earned the \nhighest score on the Texas bar exam that year. She was a practicing \nlawyer before she was nominated for the supreme court. And she has been \nelected since her nomination and won over 80 percent of the vote of \nTexans and was endorsed by every newspaper in Texas.\n  She enjoys broad support. The American Bar Association, as the \ndistinguished chairman mentioned, has voted her unanimously well \nqualified. The Dallas Morning News called her record one of \naccomplishment and integrity.\n  The Houston Chronicle wrote: She has the proper balance of judicial \nexperience, solid legal scholarship, and real world knowhow. This is \nexactly what we want in judges, people who have been in the real world, \nwho have practiced law, who know what it is to be in a courtroom and \nsee two sides of the issue. She also has the academic qualifications \nthat you would want in a judge.\n  I cannot think of any better qualification. She has been supported \nacross the board by people with whom she has served, both Democrat and \nRepublican.\n  Let me read the words of former Texas Supreme Court Chief Justice \nJohn Hill, who also served our State as attorney general. He is a \nDemocrat. He denounced the false accusations about Priscilla Owen's \nrecord by special interest groups. He said:\n\n       Their attacks on Justice Owen in particular are \n     breathtakingly dishonest, ignoring her long held commitment \n     to reform, and grossly distorting her rulings.\n\n  Tellingly, the groups made no effort to assess whether her decisions \nare legally sound. He said:\n\n       I know Texas politics and can clearly say that these \n     assaults on Justice Owen's record are false, misleading, and \n     deliberate distortions.\n\n  In addition, another judge with whom she served on the Texas Supreme \nCourt, Raul Gonzales, gave her a sterling endorsement.\n  Two former State bar presidents who are women--there have not been \nbut three or four women State bar presidents, one of whom is Harriet \nMiers, who supports Justice Owen; she is now counsel to President \nBush--yesterday Colleen McHugh, a Republican, a former State bar \npresident, and Lynne Liberato, a Democrat, a former State bar \npresident, ringingly endorsed Justice Owen.\n  These are the people who have seen her in action, who have seen her \nopinions, who have worked before her court on both sides. They have \nwon, they have lost, and they have given her the ringing endorsement.\n  I think there are two areas where the other side has distorted the \nfacts. It has continually been quoted, Judge Gonzales' opinion \ndissenting from the opinion of Justice Owen--hers was the dissent; his \nwas the majority--in which he said he thought she was being judicially \nactive. But Judge Gonzales is the very person who recommended her to \nthe President for the Fifth Circuit slot because he looked at the \ntotality of her record, and he felt that she was the best qualified \nperson for this nomination.\n  He held her in such high regard that he singled her out and took her \nfrom the supreme court to suggest that she should be on the Fifth \nCircuit because he knows that she follows the law as she sees it and \ndoes not allow her personal opinions to interfere, which is why I think \nshe has been attacked by\n\n[[Page S5623]]\n\nthe pro-abortion groups who misunderstand her opinions.\n  Texas has a parental notification statute on abortion. The law was \npassed in the year 2000. This is not parental consent; it is parental \nnotification. So in the years since the law was passed, the supreme \ncourt has been called upon to look at the lower court opinions. Justice \nOwen has voted with the majority 11 times out of 14. And, in fact, out \nof those 14 cases that have come before the court, only 3 have reversed \nthe lower court opinions.\n  I think the reason Justice Owen has so adhered to the lower court \nfact finding is for the very reason we want her on the bench; that is, \nthat she believes the trier of fact is the court that should make the \ndecisions on fact; and unless there is a reason to believe that lower \ncourt has misconstrued the intent of the legislature under the law, \nthat court should not be reversed. Even if she believes that maybe the \ncourt made a mistake on the facts, she does not put herself in the \nplace of the fact finders since she is not the one who heard the facts \nin person.\n  She is not a judicial activist. She is the opposite. In fact, her \nrecord shows that she has gone far beyond what most judges do not to \nput her personal opinions in place. I do not know what her views on \nabortion are. She has never told anyone what her views on abortion are \nbecause she does not ever intend to let her personal views skew an \nopinion on this very sensitive issue.\n  She also said, in defending her record on these issues, that she took \nthe Supreme Court of the United States interpretation of the words that \nwould define when a young woman under the age of consent would be able \nto make the decision on her own without notifying her parents. She took \nthe U.S. Supreme Court, which is exactly what a judge should do.\n  So I think Justice Owen has been put into the political meat grinder \nin Washington, DC. Anyone in Texas you would ask--now, I am not saying \nthat everyone in Texas would say she is their choice; I am not saying \nthat because I have not talked to everyone in Texas about her in \nparticular, but the vast majority of people who know her best, who have \npracticed before her court, who know the supreme court and what it \ntakes to be a good judge, they have come up here, Democrats and \nRepublicans--not just Democrats and Republicans, leading Democrats and \nRepublicans, the former Democratic attorney general, the former \nDemocratic supreme court chief justice, and another former Democratic \njustice on the supreme court--they have come forward to say she should \nbe confirmed, that they support her, that she is the right kind of \nperson for a judgeship.\n\n  I hope we will be able to meet the 60-vote standard the Democrats are \nnow setting for many judges. That 60-vote standard is wrong. It is \nagainst the Constitution. She deserves a vote. She should have the 51-\nvote standard as the Constitution intended. I hope the Democrats will \ngive her that chance. She is the most qualified person for this \nposition we could ever put forward. I know her personally. I know her \nintegrity. I know what a wonderful human being she is. I have seen her \ndemeanor as she has gone through this meat grinder.\n  I hope the Senate will give her the dignity she deserves and confirm \nher today.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from Utah has 11 \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me continue then.\n  This body is in danger of blowing up. I just read a letter Senator \nSchumer sent to the President yesterday suggesting that we should take \nthis authority from the President to nominate the judges and set up \njudicial nominating commissions in every State. There is no President \nin his right mind who would consider doing that. There is no reason a \nPresident should. To make a long story short, the Senate is broken. The \nprocess is broken. Senator Schumer admits it. He writes:\n\n       Dear Mr. President: Six months ago you described the \n     judicial nomination confirmation process as ``broken'' and \n     declared we have a ``duty to repair it.'' I could not agree \n     with you more.\n\n  The other side of this body understands this process is broken \nbecause they are filibustering now two of the President's nominees for \nthe first time in history.\n  Both of these nominees, Miguel Estrada and Priscilla Owen, have \nunanimously well qualified ratings from the American Bar Association, \nwhich during the Clinton years the Democrats were saying was the gold \nstandard. Once they have a qualified rating, which is a passable \nrating, they should be confirmed. These two not only have qualified, \nthey have well qualified, and unanimously. Only a select few have \nachieved that rating. It is outrageous that we hear again and again, \nwithout a single pause, that a nominee rated unanimously well qualified \nfor Federal judicial service is ``out of the mainstream.''\n  Those who have served with her on the Texas Supreme Court know that \ncharge is false. Former Texas Supreme Court Justices John Hill, Jack \nHightower, Raul Gonzalez, all Democrats, call Justice Owen unbiased and \nrestrained in her decisionmaking, and they praise her impeccable \nintegrity, character, and scholarship.\n  Senator Cornyn, whom we all respect, who served with Justice Owen on \nthe Texas Supreme Court, has made it clear that the charge is false. \nAlberto Gonzales, who also served with Justice Owen, said the charge is \nfalse. Senator Cornyn and Judge Gonzales believe Justice Owen is a \nterrific judge. The two individuals who are repeatedly drafted as \nprosecution witnesses to discredit Justice Owen as an activist judge, \nJudge Alberto Gonzales and Senator Cornyn, are actually two of her \nbiggest supporters. All you can conclude is that they are smearing this \nvery fine, unanimously well qualified woman in their comments and also \nthrough this filibuster. Nothing can change the fact that the two they \nuse to criticize her are her biggest supporters. I fit in that \ncategory, too, as one of her biggest supporters.\n  No matter how hard they try, they cannot distort that. The \nunqualified endorsement of 15 past presidents of the Texas State Bar, \nDemocrats and Republicans alike, also shows that the charge is false. \nJustice Owen is a well qualified, mainstream jurist. And to say that \nthe bar association is wrong, all these Democrats down in Texas are \nwrong, shows the paucity of the argument.\n  Some criticize a few rulings made by Justice Owen in some parental \nnotification cases which involve a minor girl seeking an abortion. This \nis really the basis of it because my colleagues on the other side are \ngetting so enamored with abortion that that becomes the single litmus \ntest on every judge. And they are so afraid that this woman judge might \nbe pro-life, even though I don't know what she is and she didn't say \nwhat she believes, but she did say she would follow Roe v. Wade as \nsettled law. I don't know what more you can have. And because she is \nunanimously well qualified for honor, integrity, impeccability, and so \nforth, we can take her word for it.\n  Texas happens to have a statute requiring that a minor notify one \nparent before she has an abortion. The statute allows the minor girl's \nparents to be involved in this very important decision. Our colleagues \non the other side apparently don't think that is a good idea. It \nupholds the right of parents in the upbringing and care of their \nchildren, and the American people support the principle.\n  According to a January 2003 CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll, 73 percent of \nAmericans favor requiring minor girls to obtain parental consent before \nobtaining an abortion. The Texas statute doesn't even go that far; it \nrequires only notice. This broad support is also found in the \nindividual States. Currently, 32 States across the country enforce laws \nrequiring parental involvement in a minor girl's decision to obtain an \nabortion. Fully 18 States enforce parental consent laws, including \nLouisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, North Carolina, North Dakota--where \nboth parents must consent--Rhode Island, and Wisconsin. These are \nStates represented in the Senate by both Republican and Democratic \nSenators, pro-life and pro-choice Senators. These are States inhabited \nby people of a variety of beliefs and positions.\n  Simply being pro-life or pro-choice does not make a person out of the \nmainstream. That is the only argument they have. How can you call\n\n[[Page S5624]]\n\nsomebody who has a unanimously well qualified rating from the American \nBar Association out of the mainstream? That is the height of absurdity, \nand it shows the ridiculousness of the argument being used against her.\n  Another 14 States have less stringent parental involvement laws \nrequiring parental notification before a minor has an abortion, \nincluding the States of Arkansas, Delaware, Georgia, Iowa, Maryland, \nMinnesota, Texas, and West Virginia. New Hampshire, which is known as a \npro-choice State because of widespread support for abortion rights \namong State citizens, is close to passing a parental notification law. \nNotably, the bill's main sponsor in New Hampshire openly supports \nabortion rights.\n  Even in States with no laws requiring parental involvement in a \nminor's abortion decision, popular support for such legislation runs \nhigh. In the State of Vermont, more than 70 percent of State citizens \nsupport requiring a minor to notify her parents before having an \nabortion. You would think anybody with a brain would want to do that. \nThese are kids. The parents ought to be involved.\n  But by comparison, parental consent and notification laws are \nconsistently opposed by the same abortion rights interest groups. These \norganizations are the ones that do not reflect the thinking of \nmainstream America on parental rights. Mainstream America supports the \nfundamental rights of parents in the rearing of their children, \nincluding the right to be involved in their minor daughter's \nreproductive choices.\n\n  The abortion rights interest groups, as they do over and over, \npredict doom and gloom if Justice Owen is allowed to take a seat on the \nFederal bench. They trot out the excited rhetoric about the nominee's \nhostility and extreme insensitivity to abortion rights. Occasionally \nthey even top themselves. According to one group, Justice Owen must be \nopposed because ``at this time of global turmoil, we don't need \nextremists in the courts willing to make a Dred Scott decision in the \narea of women's fundamental rights.''\n  Give me a break. I would be ashamed to make those arguments, yet that \nis what they are doing. They are smearing this woman with these kinds \nof arguments that fly in the face of the vast majority of people who \nbelieve parents do have some role with regard to their children, \nespecially in something as important as whether or not their daughter \nshould have an abortion.\n  By now we know these outside groups' track record leaves much to be \ndesired when it comes to predicting how judicial nominees will vote. \nThese groups have cried wolf far too many times to be taken seriously \nany longer. We know they missed on Justice David Souter, Justice John \nPaul Stevens, Justice Lewis Powell, when they predicted at their \nhearings they would ignore the Constitution and put an end to freedom \nin America. No matter how much some would prefer to argue the point, \nthese cases were not about the right to an abortion.\n  The opposition to Justice Owen may show that the abortion litmus test \nis alive and well, but there was never any question about the girls' \nright to an abortion in these cases.\n  Indeed, Justice Owen argued in one such case that, based on Supreme \nCourt precedent, a statute requiring a girl to notify both parents \nwould also be questionable under the Constitution. She even went that \nfar toward their position. Justice Owen recognizes a woman's right to \nobtain an abortion. She said so explicitly. Yet, they treat her like \nshe is going to throw out Roe V. Wade all by herself and ignore \nprecedent.\n  Justice Owen has been well within the mainstream of her court in the \n14 decided notification cases, joining the majority judgment in 11 of \nthose cases. And out of the close to 800 bypass cases since the Texas \nstatute was passed, a mere 12 girls out of 800 have appealed all the \nway to the Texas Supreme Court. These are usually the toughest cases. \nThe Democrats take the position that they ought to all be decided \nagainst the parents and in favor of the girl or of abortion rights. My \ngosh. By this time, two courts--the trial and the appeals courts--have \nalready considered the bypass petition and turned it down. In other \nwords, the right of a court to give a girl a bypass to avoid having to \ntell her parents. In these cases, they turned them down. Given the \ndeference appellate courts must pay to the findings of the trial court, \nthe decision is likely to affirm the lower court rulings denying a \nbypass. That should be no great surprise.\n  Certainly, Justice Owen and her colleagues on the Texas Supreme Court \ndisagreed in some cases--that is no surprise either; that happens on \nState supreme courts--but in all cases there was a genuine effort to \napply applicable precedent. These parental consent cases show Justice \nOwen takes Supreme Court precedent seriously. She looks to precedent \nfor guidance, she cites it, and she makes a good faith effort to apply \nit to the case at hand. She is a judge who defers to the legislature's \nconsidered judgment in their policy choices and earnestly seeks to \nascertain legislative intent in her ruling. None of her opinions, to \nquote the Washington Post, ``seem[s] to us [to be] beyond the range of \nreasonable judicial disagreement.''\n\n  What is beyond the range of reasonable disagreement is the charge \nthat Justice Owen is not qualified to sit on the Fifth Circuit Court of \nAppeals.\n  A native of Texas, Justice Owen attended Baylor University and Baylor \nUniversity School of Law. She graduated cum laude from both \ninstitutions. She finished third in her law school class.\n  Justice Owen earned the highest score on the Texas bar exam and \nthereafter worked for the next 17 years as a commercial litigator \nspecializing in oil and gas matters.\n  Justice Owen is known for her services for the poor and for her work \non gender and family law issues. Justice Owen has taken a genuine \ninterest in improving access to justice for the poor. She successfully \nfought with others for more funding for legal aid services for the \nindigent.\n  Justice Owen is committed to creating opportunities for women in the \nlegal profession. She has been a member of the Texas Supreme Court \nGender Neutral Task Force, and she served as one of the editors of the \nGender Neutral Handbook. Incredibly, this is the same woman the usual \ninterest groups mischaracterize as ``anti-woman.''\n  Justice Owen's confirmation may not be cheered by the well-funded and \npartisan Texas trial-attorney interest groups, but she is backed by \nTexas lawyers such as E. Thomas Bishop, president of the Texas \nAssociation of Defense Counsel, and William B. Emmons, a Texas trial \nattorney and a Democrat who says that Justice Owen ``will serve [the \nFifth Circuit] and the United States exceptionally well.''\n  Justice Owen has served on the Texas Supreme Court since 1994, \nwinning reelection to another 6-year term in the year 2000 with 84 \npercent support.\n  This kind of support--running across the board and across party \nlines--leaves no doubt that Justice Owen is a fair-minded, mainstream \njurist.\n  Mr. President, Justice Priscilla Owen will be a terrific Federal \njudge. As I said earlier, we have a choice this morning. Will we block \nanother highly qualified nominee for partisan reasons or will we allow \neach Senator to decide the merits of the nomination for himself or \nherself. I know my choice: we should allow a vote. I hope my colleagues \nwill do the right thing and make the same choice.\n  I will conclude by saying, look, when I hear on the other side that \nthey are standing up for women's rights, while they are rejecting one \nof the leading woman jurists in the Nation who has said she will uphold \ntheir wonderful standard of Roe v. Wade, I have to say that is pure \nbunk. It is time to quit smearing these judges.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, how much time is available to the Senator \nfrom Vermont?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 18 minutes 15 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the distinguished Presiding Officer.\n  Madam President, I regret we have to be here today, but we are here \nbecause the President has picked another fight with the Senate by \nrenominating a divisive and controversial activist to another circuit \ncourt. That is regrettable. The Republican leadership in the Senate is \nforcing this confrontation at this time, and it is neither necessary \nnor constructive. I am sorry the White\n\n[[Page S5625]]\n\nHouse has chosen to make these matters into partisan political fights, \nrather than working with Senators on both sides of the aisle to fill \njudicial vacancies with qualified consensus nominees.\n  I have been here with six Presidents. Five of them, from both \nparties, would work with members on both sides of the aisle for \nconsensus nominees. This is the first President who has not. Despite \nwhat is really a historic low level of cooperation from the White \nHouse--and it is the lowest level of cooperation from any White House I \nhave ever had experience with in my 30 years in the Senate--we have \nalready confirmed 120 of President Bush's judicial nominees. We have \nconfirmed 120. We have rejected 2 out of 120. That is not a bad record. \nSome of them we voted for, including some of the most divisive and \ncontroversial nominees sent up by any President. So 120 passed, 2 are \nbeing held up. I don't know where that shows an obstructionist Senate. \nThis week the Senate debated and voted on the nomination of Jeffrey \nSutton to the Sixth Circuit. This was a divisive one, and I think the \nfact that it is so divisive is shown by the fact he got the fewest \nnumber of favorable votes of any confirmation in almost 20 years--\nbarely a majority. He got 52. That is the lowest number of votes any \njudge has had in about 20 years. That reflects the fact we have reached \nthe point in the queue where many of these nominations divide the \nAmerican people and the Senate far more than they unite us. I urge the \nPresident to be a uniter, not a divider. This is the third \ncontroversial judicial nominee of this President against whom more than \n40 negative votes were cast.\n\n  Our Senate Democratic leadership is working hard to correct some of \nthe problems that arose with some of the earlier hearings and actions \nof the Judiciary Committee this year. Just yesterday, we were able to \nhold a hearing on the nomination of John Roberts to the District of \nColumbia Circuit. He was put in almost as an afterthought. There was a \nmassive day of hearings, and he was not able to get a full hearing. \nThis was done by the Republican leadership. I appreciate the fact they \nrecognized that was wrong and they had another hearing yesterday. We \nare all working hard to complete committee consideration of that \nnomination at the earliest opportunity.\n  The distinguished chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee said he \nwill put off that nomination today for a hearing sometime next week, \nand we will have a vote on him.\n  I am optimistic our leadership will be able to work out a procedure \nfor Senate consideration of the nomination of Deborah Cook to the Sixth \nCircuit. So a number of controversial nominations are being considered. \nI point out there are other nominations, such as that of Judge Edward \nPrado of Texas, a distinguished Hispanic jurist. Every Democratic \nSenator said they are willing to go forward with a vote on him. He has \nbeen held up on the Republican side. I don't know if we are going to be \nblamed for holding up this judge or not. We have all agreed we are \nready to go forward with a short time agreement and a vote. He will be \nconfirmed. He is not being held up on the Democratic side, but by the \nRepublican side, even though he is one of President Bush's nominees.\n  There is also Judge Cecilia Altonaga, on whom we have been seeking \nconsideration for some time. I hope the Republican leadership will let \nthem go forward.\n  We are making progress. The glass is not full, but it is more full \nthan empty. More has been achieved than some want to acknowledge. There \nhave been 120 lifetime confirmations in less than 2 years. That is \nbetter than in any 2-year period from 1995 through the year 2000. Why \ndo I mention that time? Because the Republicans were in charge and \nPresident Clinton was the President. We have done better in less than 2 \nyears than in any 2-year period when they were in charge. This time, 17 \nmonths of that was under Democratic control, where we set a record with \nthe number of Senatorial confirmations of Presidential nominations.\n  We have reduced judicial vacancies to 48, which is the lowest \npercentage in more than 12 years. During the entire 8-year term of \nPresident Clinton, the Republicans never allowed the vacancy rate to \nget this low. We have made tremendous progress.\n  The Republicans continue their drumbeat of political recriminations. \nWe ought to talk about how far we have come with the 110 vacancies \nDemocrats inherited from the Republican majority in the summer of 2001. \nWe have cut those vacancies in half.\n  Under the Republican majority, circuit vacancies more than doubled \nand overall vacancies increased significantly. Despite the fact that \nmore than 40 additional vacancies have arisen since the summer of 2001, \nwe have cut those vacancies by more than in half, from 110 to 48. If we \nhad a little bit of cooperation from the other end of Pennsylvania \nAvenue and from the other side of the aisle, we could achieve so much \nmore.\n  This is a nomination that should not have been made in the first \nplace and never should have been remade in the second place. It was \nrejected by the Judiciary Committee last year after a fair hearing and \nextensive and thoughtful substantive consideration. I think the White \nHouse would rather play politics with judicial nominations than solve \nproblems. This unprecedented renomination of a person voted down by the \nSenate Judiciary Committee is proof of that.\n  I thank the Democratic leader, the assistant leader, and my \nDemocratic colleagues who have spoken so eloquently and passionately to \nthese matters. Particularly the statements of Senators Mikulski, \nMurray, Cantwell, and Stabenow yesterday were outstanding.\n  This nomination is extreme. This nominee has shown herself to be a \njudicial activist and extremist even on the very conservative Texas \nSupreme Court where her conservative colleagues have criticized her \njudgements as activist. They have done it not once, not twice but again \nand again.\n  The nomination process starts with the President. It is high time for \nthe White House to stop the partisanship and campaign rhetoric. Work \nwith us not to divide us but to unite us, and work with us to ensure \nthe independence and impartiality of the Federal judiciary, something \nthat Presidents have cherished for over 200 years, so that all the \nAmerican people, whether they are Republicans or Democrats, rich, poor, \nWhite, Black, plaintiff or defendant, can go into every Federal \ncourtroom across the country and know that they will receive a fair \nhearing and justice under the law; that they will come into the one \nplace that is supposed to be impartial, the one place that is supposed \nto be nonpolitical, the one place that is supposed to look only at the \nlitigants and the law, and so they will not go instead into a \npoliticized, partisan Federal judiciary. That would be a mistake that \nwould hurt us all and that is what we are trying to avoid now.\n  How much time is remaining on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Nine minutes twenty seconds remaining.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield such time as he may consume to the distinguished \nsenior Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I want to thank our leader on the \nJudiciary Committee for his indefatigable efforts to keep the bench \nnonpartisan, or bipartisan, or at least moderate, as much as he has \ndone. History will look back very kindly on the leadership of the \nSenator from Vermont and say that he made a courageous fight. Many of \nus are proud to be at his side in that fight.\n  I will speak for a few minutes about the nomination of Judge Owen. \nThe issue is not whether Judge Owen is a conservative; it is whether \nshe will take her own views and subrogate them to the views of what the \nlaw is. If we look at her history, time and time again Judge Owen has \nbeen unwilling to follow the law and instead impose her own very \nconservative ideology on the courts. She is clearly not a moderate, but \nit is not even that she is a conservative that bothers many of us. I \nhave voted for over 100 judges that the President has nominated, and \nthe vast majority could clearly be classified as conservative. In fact, \nwhat worries us about Judge Owen is that she is what conservatives used \nto excoriate, an activist, somebody who will impose her own views \nbecause she feels them so strongly and passionately.\n  I respect people who feel things passionately. I do. But when someone \nis a judge, that is not what they should bring to the bench. It is not \nreally passion, except in rare instances, that\n\n[[Page S5626]]\n\nserves the bench well. It is, rather, an ability to understand the law \nand follow it.\n\n  I do not have many doubts that Judge Owen understands the law. She is \na bright person. I have very real doubts whether she will follow it.\n  Conservative members of the Texas bench, none other than Judge \nGonzales, now the President's counsel, have pointed out in instance \nafter instance where Judge Owen has simply gone far afield and imposed \nher own views rather than do what the Founding Fathers wanted. I speak \nof the Founding Fathers, and it is a timely coincidence that our leader \nfrom West Virginia has come in. He has been the guardian of the \nConstitution, and he could tell us better than anyone else that the \nFounding Fathers asked--judges to interpret the law, not make law. The \ngreat irony, as we go through these debates, is that in the 1960s and \n1970s the hue and cry of people of Judge Owen's philosophy was that \njudges are making law from the bench.\n  I had some sympathy for those arguments then. I have sympathy now, \neven though I might be very sympathetic to the laws they were making. \nBut now, all of a sudden we have had nominee after nominee who are not \nactivists from the left but activists from the right. It is quite \nlogical that if one is on either the far left or the far right, they \nwill have much more of a desire--there are exceptions to every rule but \nmuch more of a desire to impose law rather than interpret law, and of \nall the nominees who have come before us, Judge Owen seems to be the \napotheoses of that view because in case after case that is exactly what \nshe has done.\n  Many of us believe, for instance, that Miguel Estrada would do the \nsame thing, but he does not have a record and he refuses to answer \nquestions. But with Judge Owen, the record is crystal clear that in \ninstance after instance she has not subrogated her own personal \nfeelings but, rather, let them dominate her decisionmaking. That is not \nwhat a judge ought to be.\n  We will defeat this motion for cloture, and I am glad we will. \nHistory will look kindly on that as well because never has a President \nof the United States been more ideological in his selection of judges, \nnever.\n  I have been studying the history and for the first time, this \nPresident--whether because he wants to win political favor of the hard \nright or because he believes it himself, I do not know; I have not \ndiscussed it with him--this President wishes to change America through \nthe article III section of Government, the judiciary. And so nominee \nafter nominee is not just a mainstream conservative but somebody who \nwears their views on their sleeve and is not at all shy about imposing \nthose views on court decisions.\n  So those of us on this side who are opposing Judge Owen, and some of \nthe other judges, believe that we are fighting for the Constitution, we \nare fighting for what the Founding Fathers intended judges to be, we \nare fighting a President who is more ideological in his selection of \njudges than any, and we will continue this fight.\n  I have seen our caucus. We were hesitant when we took the first \nsteps. We are stronger. I think we feel this issue more passionately \nthan before, not at all for political reasons. I can't tell you where \nthe political chips fall out on this one. It is a rather esoteric \nissue. A few people in America on each side feel strongly about the \nissue but most do not. We know we are doing the right thing.\n  I am proud of our caucus. I am proud of this moment today. I think it \nis so important to try to get the President to back off this plan, \nwhich is so out of the thinking of the Founding Fathers, to make law \nfrom the one nonelected section of the Government, the judiciary, the \narticle III section.\n  So I will stand proudly today and move that we not go to vote on \nJudge Owen, not because she has not answered questions. To her credit, \nshe was more forthright than Miguel Estrada and, frankly, than John \nRobert of yesterday but, rather, because she does not represent the \nkind of judge the Founding Fathers wanted and America should have. I \nhope we can defeat her.\n  I yield my remaining time back to our leader from Vermont.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the nomination \nof Priscilla Owen to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit \nand also in opposition to ending debate on consideration of her \nnomination.\n  I believe that a filibuster of a judicial nominee is an extraordinary \nmeasure, a step to be taken only in the most compelling circumstances. \nThe case of Justice Owen is one of those rare situations. In Justice \nOwen, we are presented with a nominee whose record demonstrates that \nshe is so far outside the mainstream and so clearly prone to substitute \nher personal preferences for the legally required result as to compel \nthis conclusion.\n  Our debate today is not, of course, the first time the Senate has \nconsidered Justice Owen's nomination. She was nominated for a seat on \nthe Fifth Circuit last year, and we held an extensive hearing at the \nJudiciary Committee on her nomination. After meeting with her, and \nthoroughly reviewing her record and her testimony, I opposed her \nnomination. Despite her defeat in the Judiciary Committee last year, \nthe President saw fit to renominate Justice Owen for the Fifth Circuit \nonce again this year. Nothing at her most recent confirmation hearing \nalters my conclusion that she is fundamentally unfit for a federal \nappellate judgeship.\n  My opposition to Justice Owen is not because of any doubts regarding \nher intellectual ability--we all recognize her legal talents. And, \nunlike Miguel Estrada, my primary concern with respect to Justice Owen \ndoes not center on her unwillingness to answer questions at her \nconfirmation hearing. Quite the contrary: Justice Owen's answers to our \nquestions made one thing crystal clear--her consistent record of \njudicial activism, and her demonstrated willingness to substitute her \njudgment and policy preferences for those of the legislature.\n  As Justice Owen's record became known last year, we grew increasingly \nconcerned about her willingness to bend the law to suit her own \nstrongly held opinions under the guise of ``interpretation.'' We should \nnot be concerned that her views are conservative on many issues. \nHowever, when those beliefs interfere with her ability to apply the \nlaw, we are forced to oppose her nomination.\n  Merely reviewing the comments of her fellow Texas Supreme Court \njustices compels us to the unfortunate conclusion she cannot be trusted \nto accurately interpret the law. In a variety of cases, her colleagues \nhave criticized her opinions for not being grounded in the law. She is \nclearly and consistently outside of the mainstream in many cases. In an \nenvironmental case, FM Properties, she was criticized for basing her \narguments on ``flawed premises'' and ``inflammatory rhetoric.'' In an \nage discrimination suit, Quantum Chemical, she was criticized by the \nmajority for not following the plain meaning of the statute. In a \nconsumer lawsuit, Texas Department of Transportation, the majority \ncriticized her, writing that ``the statute's plain meaning'' indicated \nthat she was wrong. And, finally, in Doe I, a choice case in which she \ndissented, then Justice Alberto Gonzales called her dissent ``an \nunconscionable act of judicial activism.''\n  There is a pattern to this criticism that should not be ignored. She \nrepeatedly alters the law to fit her views in ways that the legislature \ndid not intend and that the majority of her own court condemns.\n  We all know that the law is subject to interpretation and \nmanipulation. The manner in which a judge interprets law is \nparticularly important when considering a nominee to an appellate \ncourt. On the circuit court, subject only to the infrequent supervision \nof the U.S. Supreme Court, a judge has considerable leeway to make \npolicy if she chooses with little concern of being overruled.\n  Justice Owen's willingness to bend the law to suit her policy \npreferences are unacceptable, especially for a nominee to an appellate \ncourt judgeship. Justice Owen's nearly decade long record as a Texas \nSupreme Court Justice gives us little confidence that she will \nfaithfully discharge her obligations as a federal appellate judge. To \nproceed with Justice Owen's nomination would mean taking the risk of \nplacing on a Federal court of appeals for life someone who has \nrepeatedly\n\n[[Page S5627]]\n\ndemonstrated little hesitance to disregard clear statutory language to \nrewrite the law to suit her personal preferences. This is a risk we \ncannot take.\n  Anyone who reviews my record on judicial nominations knows that I \nhave not reached my decision to support extended debate here--indeed my \ndecision to oppose Justice Owen's confirmation--lightly. Justice Owen \nis only one of only seven judicial nominees I have opposed in my entire \n14 years in the Senate. But this nominee's extreme record leaves me no \nchoice. I will vote to oppose cloture on her nomination.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would like to briefly explain why I will \nvote against cloture on the nomination of Priscilla R. Owen to the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.\n  Ms. Owen's record reveals that she is a judicial activist and an \nideologue. As newspaper editorials and several of our colleagues have \npointed out, she has created a strong record of rewriting the law when \nit does not match her personal convictions and beliefs. For those \nreasons, she does not deserve a life-time appointment to the U.S. \nCircuit Court of Appeals. I cannot in good conscience, exercising my \nduty under the Constitution, allow her to be appointed to as powerful \nand influential a body as the Fifth Circuit.\n  Appointees to the Federal bench must be able to set aside their \npersonal philosophies and beliefs. They must be able to administer and \nenforce the law in a fair and impartial manner. Because the U.S. \nSupreme Court hears fewer and fewer cases each year, the circuit courts \nare the court of last resort for many ordinary citizens and businesses. \nThe circuit courts often have the last word on important cases dealing \nwith civil rights, environmental protection, labor issues, and many \nothers. Circuit court judges must demonstrate a record of integrity, \nhonesty, fairness, and a willingness to uphold the law. Ms. Owen fails \nthis test.\n  For example, Ms. Owen has published opinions and dissents that have \ndrawn criticism from other conservatives and Republicans as \ninconsistent with the law or facts in front of her. We've heard over \nand over about her decision in FM Properties v. City of Austin, where \nthe majority on the Texas Supreme Court--consisting of two current Bush \nappointees and current White House counsel Alberto Gonzales--called her \ndissent ``nothing more than inflammatory rhetoric.''\n  Additionally, in her dissent to the Texas Supreme Court decision In \nre Jane Doe 1, Owen proposed to require a minor to show knowledge of \nreligious arguments against abortion. In a separate concurrence, Mr. \nGonzales said that to the interpret the law as Owen did ``would be an \nunconscionable act of judicial activism.''\n  The administration has every right to appoint judges who share the \nPresident's philosophy and beliefs. That is entirely proper. However, \nthat does not give the President the right to appoint judicial \nactivists who have not demonstrated a respect for the law, or an \nability to set aside their personal beliefs in order to interpret the \nlaw in a fair and impartial manner.\n  Additionally, a President has never resubmitted a previously rejected \ncircuit court nominee for the same vacancy, as this President has with \nMs. Owen. And, the Judiciary Committee for the first time approved a \nnominee that it had previously rejected. That nominee is Ms. Owen.\n  So not only does her record of judicial activism disqualify her for a \nlife-time appointment to the Fifth Circuit, her approval by the \nJudiciary Committee and consideration by the full Senate is highly \nunusual and without precedent.\n  For all of the above reasons, I must oppose Ms. Owen's nomination to \nthe Fifth Circuit and vote against cloture on her nomination.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will vote no on the nomination of \nPriscilla Owen to be a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth \nCircuit and no on cloture. I'd like to take a moment to explain my \ndecision.\n  There are a number of factors that I believe require us to give this \nnomination very careful consideration. First, we should consider that \njudges on our Courts of Appeals have an enormous influence on the law. \nWhereas decisions of the District Courts are always subject to \nappellate review, the decisions of the Courts of Appeals are subject \nonly to discretionary review by the Supreme Court. The decisions of the \nCourts of Appeals are in almost all cases final, as the Supreme Court \nagrees to hear only a very small percentage of the cases on which its \nviews are sought. that means that the scrutiny that we give to Circuit \nCourt nominees must be greater than that we give to District Court \nnominees.\n  Another important consideration is the ideological balance of the \nFifth Circuit. The Fifth Circuit is comprised of Texas, Louisiana, and \nMississippi. The Fifth Circuit contains the highest percentage of \nminority residents--over 40 percent--of any circuit other than the D.C. \nCircuit. It is a court that during the civil rights era issued some of \nthe most significant decisions supporting the rights of African \nAmerican citizens to participate as full members of our society. As \nsomeone who believes strongly in freedom, liberty, and equal justice \nunder law, and the important role of the Federal courts to defend these \nfundamental American principles, I am especially concerned about the \nmake-up of our circuit courts and their approaches to civil rights \nissues.\n  Even after 8 years of a Democratic President, the Fifth Circuit had \ntwice as many Republican appointees as Democratic appointees. that is \nbecause during the last 6 years of the Clinton administration, the \nJudiciary Committee did not report out a single judge to the Fifth \nCircuit. And as we all know, that was not for lack of nominees to \nconsider. President Clinton nominated three well-qualified lawyers to \nthe Fifth Circuit--Jorge Rangel, Enrique Moreno, and Alson Johnson. \nNone of these nominees even received a hearing before this Committee. \nWhen then-Chairman Leahy held a hearing in July 2001 on the nomination \nof Judge Clement for a seat on the Fifth Circuit, only a few months \nafter she was nominated, and less than 2 months after Democrats took \ncontrol of the Senate, it was the first hearing in this committee for a \nFifth Circuit nominee since September 1994. Judge Clement, of course, \nwas confirmed later in the year.\n\n  So, there's a history here, and a special burden on President Bush to \nconsult with our side on nominees for this Circuit. Otherwise, we would \nsimply be rewarding the obstructionism that the President's party \nengaged in over the last 6 years by allowing him to fill with his \nchoices seats that his party held open for years, even when qualified \nnominees were advanced by President Clinton. And I say once again, my \ncolleagues on the Republican side bear some responsibility for this \nsituation, and they can help resolve it by urging the administration to \naddress the injustices suffered by so many Clinton nominees. One step \nin the right direction would be for my Republican colleagues to urge \nthe President to renominate some of those Clinton nominees that never \nreceived a hearing or vote in this committee. That includes Clinton \nnominees to the Fifth Circuit.\n  With that background, let me outline the concerns that have caused me \nto reach the conclusion that Justice Owen should not be confirmed.\n  Justice Owen has had a successful legal career. She graduated at the \ntop of her class from Baylor University Law School, worked as an \nassociate and partner at the law firm of Andrews and Kurth in Houston, \nand has served on the Texas Supreme Court since January 1995. These are \ngreat accomplishments.\n  But Justice Owen's record as a member of the Texas Supreme Court \nleads me to conclude that she is not the right person for a position on \nthe Fifth Circuit. I am not convinced that Justice Owen will put aside \nher personal views and ensure that all litigants before her on the \nFifth Circuit received a fair hearing. Her decisions in cases involving \nconsumers' rights, worker's rights, and reproductive rights suggest to \nme that she would be a judge who would be unable to maintain an open \nmind and provide all litigants a fair and impartial hearing.\n  Justice Owen has a disturbing record of siding against consumers or \nvictims of personal injury and in favor of business and insurance \ncompanies. When the Texas Supreme Court, which is a very conservative \nand pro-business court, rules in favor of consumers or victims of \npersonal injury, Justice Owen frequently dissents. According to\n\n[[Page S5628]]\n\nTexas Watch, during the period 1999-2002, Justice Owen dissented almost \n40 percent of time in cases in which a consumer prevailed. But in cases \nwhere the consumer position has not succeeded, Justice Owen never \ndissented.\n  At her first hearing, Senator Kennedy and Senator Edwards asked \nJustice Owen to cite cases in which she dissented from the majority and \nsided in favor of consumers. Justice Owen could cite only one case, \nSaenz v. Fidelity Guaranty Ins. Underwriters, 925 S.W. 2d 607, Tex. \n1996. But Justice Owen's opinion in this case hardly took a pro-\nconsumer position since it still would have deprived the plaintiff of \nthe entire jury verdict. She did not join Justice Spector's dissent, \nwhich would have upheld the jury verdict in favor of Ms. Saenz.\n\n  Also during that first hearing, Senators Feinstein and Durbin \nquestioned Justice Owen about Provident American Ins. Co. v. Castaneda, \n988 S.W. 2d 189, Tex. 1998. In that case, the plaintiff sought damages \nagainst a health insurer for denying health care benefits, after the \ninsurer had already provided pre-operative approval for the surgery. \nJustice Owen, writing for the majority, reversed the jury's verdict in \nfavor of the plaintiff and rejected the plaintiff's claim that the \nhealth insurer violated the Texas Insurance Code and the Deceptive \nTrade Practices Act. At the hearing, Justice Owen defended her opinion \nby saying that she believed that the plaintiff was seeking extra-\ncontractual damages and that the plaintiff had already received full \ncoverage under the policy and statutory penalties. But, in the words of \nher colleague, Justice Raul Gonzalez, who wrote a dissent, Justice \nOwen's opinion ``may very well eviscerate the bad-faith tort as a \nviable case of action in Texas.'' Id. at 212, Gonzalez, J., joined by \nSpector, J., dissenting. The cause of action for bad faith is designed \nto deter insurers from engaging in bad faith practices like denying \ncoverage in the first place.\n  In addition, with respect to several decisions involving \ninterpretation and application of the Texas parental notification law, \nI am deeply troubled by Justice Owen's apparently ignoring the plain \nmeaning of the statute and injecting her personal beliefs concerning \nabortion that have no basis in Texas or U.S. Supreme Court law. In \n2000, the Texas legislature enacted a parental notification law that \nallows a minor to obtain an abortion without notification of her \nparents if she demonstrates to a court that she has complied with one \nof three ``judicial bypass'' provisions: (1) that she is ``mature and \nsufficiently well informed'' to make the decision without notification \nto either of her parents, (2) that notification would not be in her \nbest interest, or (3) that notification may lead to her physical, \nsexual, or emotional abuse.\n  During Justice Owen's first confirmation hearing, Senator Cantwell \nquestioned Justice Owen about her positions in cases interpreting this \nlaw, focusing on Justice Owen's insistence in In re Jane Doe, 19 S.W. \n3d 249, 264-65, 2000, Owen, J., concurring, Doe 1 (I)), that teenagers \nbe required to consider ``philosophic, social, moral, and religious'' \narguments before seeking an abortion. In her opinion, Justice Owen \ncited the Supreme Court's decision in Planned Parenthood of \nSoutheastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, 1992, to support her \ncontention that states can require minors to consider religious views \nin their decision to have an abortion. But, as Senator Cantwell noted, \nCasey in no way authorizes States to require minors to consider \nreligious arguments in their decision on whether to have an abortion. \nUpon this further questioning, Justice Owen then said that she was \nreferring to another Supreme Court case, H.L. v. Matheson, 450 U.S. \n398, 1981, even though her opinion only cited Casey for this \nproposition. And even Matheson does not say that minors can be required \nby state law to consider religious arguments. It is my view that \nJustice Owen was going beyond not only a plain reading of the Texas \nstatute, but Supreme Court case law, and inappropriately injecting her \nown personal views to make it more difficult for a minor to comply with \nthe statute and obtain an abortion.\n\n  I was also not satisfied with Justice Owen's responses to my \nquestions about bonuses to Texas Supreme Court law clerks. I asked her \nat the hearing whether she saw any ethical concerns with allowing law \nclerks to receive bonuses from their prospective employers during their \nclerkships. I also explored the topic further with her in followup \nwritten questions. Justice Owen stated repeatedly in her written \nresponses to my questions that she is not aware of law clerks actually \nreceiving bonuses while they were employed by the Court. She reaffirmed \nthat testimony in her second hearing. This seems implausible given the \ngreat amount of publicity given to an investigation pursued by the \nTravis County Attorney of exactly that practice and the well publicized \nmodifications to the Texas Supreme Court's rules that resulted from \nthat investigation and the accompanying controversy.\n  Even more disturbing, Justice Owen took the position, both at the \nfirst hearing and in her responses to written questions, that because \nthe Texas Supreme Court Code of Conduct requires law clerks to recuse \nthemselves from matters involving their prospective employers, there \nreally is no ethical concern raised by law clerks accepting bonuses \nwhile employed with the Court. I disagree. It is not sufficient for law \nclerks to recuse themselves from matters involving their prospective \nemployers if they have received thousands of dollars in bonuses while \nthey are working for the court. The appearance of impropriety and \nunfairness that such a situation creates is untenable. As I understand \nit, the federal courts have long prohibited federal law clerks both \nfrom receiving bonuses during their clerkships and from working on \ncases involving their prospective employers. I'm pleased that the Texas \nSupreme Court finally recognized this ethical problem and changed its \ncode of conduct for clerks. Justice Owen, in contrast, seems intent on \ndefending the prior, indefensible, practice.\n  Finally, I want to note the unusual nature of this particular \nnomination. Unlike so many nominees during the Clinton years, Justice \nOwen was considered in the Judiciary Committee under Senator Leahy's \nleadership last year. She had a hearing, and she had a vote. Her \nnomination was rejected. This is the first time in history that a \nCircuit nominee who was formally rejected by the Committee, or the full \nSenate for that matter, has been renominated by the same President to \nthe same position. I do not believe that defeated judicial nominations \nshould be reconsidered like legislation that is not enacted. After all, \nlegislation can be revisited after it is enacted. If Congress makes a \nmistake when it passes a law, it can fix that mistake in subsequent \nlegislation. Judicial appointments are for life. Confirmations cannot \nbe taken back or fixed. A vote to confirm a nominee is final. A vote to \nreject that nominee should be final as well. For the President to \nrenominate a defeated nominee and the Senate to reconsider her simply \nbecause of the change of a few seats in an election cheapens the \nnomination process and the Senate's constitutional role in that \nprocess.\n  I believe Justice Owen is bright and accomplished. But I sincerely \nbelieve that based on her judicial record, Justice Owen is not the \nright choice for this position. I wish her well in her continued work \non the Texas Supreme Court, and I hope the President will put forward a \nnominee for this circuit who the committee can have confidence will \nenforce the law fairly and impartially to all litigants.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I want to respond to my colleague from \nUtah, Mr. Hatch, regarding Priscilla Owen's dissent in the case In re \nDoe, 19 S.W.3d 346, Texas 2000.\n  Let me emphasize the fact that Justice Owen wrote her own dissenting \nopinion in this case. Justice O'Neill delivered the opinion of the \ncourt, joined by Justice Enoch, Justice Baker, Justice Hankinson, and \nJustice Gonzales and by Chief Justice Phillips as to Parts II and III. \nJustice Enoch filed a concurring opinion, joined by Justice Baker. \nJustice Gonzales filed a concurring opinion, joined by Justice Enoch.\n  Three Justices dissented in this case, each filing the own separate \nopinion. The dissenting opinions were written by Justice Hecht, Justice \nOwen, and Justice Abbott.\n  Justices Gonzales, in his concurring opinion, very clearly voices \ncriticism of the dissenting opinions:\n\n       The dissenting opinions suggest that the exceptions to the \n     general rule of notification\n\n[[Page S5629]]\n\n     should be very rare and require a high standard of proof. I \n     respectfully submit that these are policy decisions for the \n     Legislature. . . . Thus, to construe the Parental \n     Notification Act so narrowly as to eliminate bypasses, or to \n     create hurdles that simply are not to be found in the words \n     of the statute, would be an unconscionable act of judicial \n     activism. As a judge, I hold the rights of parents to protect \n     and guide the education, safety, health, and development of \n     their children as one of the most important rights in our \n     society. But I cannot rewrite the statute to make parental \n     rights absolute, or virtually absolute, particularly when, as \n     here, the Legislature has elected not to do so.\n\n  The chairman of the Judiciary Committee states that Justice Owen did \nnot write the opinion that Justice Gonzales criticized. I fail to see \nhow Senator Hatch can reach that conclusion. Justice Gonzales clearly \nrefers to ``the dissenting opinions''--plural--and Justice Owen wrote \none of those dissenting opinions.\n  I trust that this resolves any dispute regarding this matter.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, how much time remains for the Senator \nfrom Vermont?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute and 40 seconds.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield back our time.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I rise this morning to offer a tribute to \nour men and women in uniform.\n  As we all know, President Bush will speak this evening to the Nation \nand mark the end of a major conflict in Iraq and acknowledge the \nheroism and sacrifice of our brave men and women in the Armed Forces. I \nknow I speak for the people of my State of Texas and for all Americans \nwhen I give thanks that this operation has reached such a swift end, \nwith so few coalition lives lost.\n  Over the April recess, I took the opportunity to visit most of the \nmilitary bases in my home State, along with my distinguished colleague \nSenator Hutchison. One in 10 active duty military personnel call Texas \ntheir home. As a member of the Armed Services Committee, I am dedicated \nto looking after their interests and the interests of all of our \nmilitary personnel.\n  We must ensure that the United States military continues to have the \ntraining, the equipment, and the facilities they need to remain the \ngreatest fighting force the world has ever known, both in war and in \npeace. The military bases we have in Texas are some of the strongest \ncomponents of our military readiness in the current war against terror, \nfrom Afghanistan to Iraq and across the world. We must use these \nvaluable assets to maintain our status as the world's lone superpower, \nas we transform our military to face the challenges of the future.\n  Seeing our soldiers face to face reminds us that they are not just \nnumbers or statistics. They are real Americans, true patriots, with \nreal families. When someone leaves their home to fight for American \ninterests abroad, it affects their entire community; it affects their \nfriends and, most profoundly, it affects their families.\n  We must remember not just the sacrifices of the brave men and women \nwho fight on the battlefield but the sacrifices of the families they \nleave behind. I remember, most poignantly, as the deployment was \noccurring from Camp Lejeune, on CNN a young mother with her child was \nsaying goodbye to her husband, the father of that child. I will never \nforget the comments she made. She said:\n\n\n[[Page S5630]]\n\n\n       I used to think that if he loved us, he would never leave \n     us. But now I know that he is leaving us because he loves us.\n\n  We must remember the sons who have never seen the faces of their \nfathers, and mothers who are separated from their children. We must \nremember the families whose loved ones will not be coming back, who \npaid the ultimate price so that others can live free.\n  Our own freedom was not won without cost but bought and paid for by \nthe sacrifices of generations that have gone before. We must honor \nthese heroic dead for their courage and their commitment to the dream \nthat is freedom.\n  On this same trip with Senator Hutchison, visiting our Texas military \nbases, I had the chance to meet with several of the former prisoners of \nwar who had just returned to their homes. It was especially meaningful \nto me, because my dad was a POW in World War II. On a bombing mission \nover Mannheim, Germany, he was shot down and captured and spent 4 \nmonths in a prison camp before General Patton and his Army came along \nand liberated him and others. Knowing the impact of my dad's \nexperience, I have sensed a glimmer of the pain, the anxiety, and \nultimately the joy of the families of these former POWs.\n  I know, in time, as both the former captives and their loved ones \nlearn the names of the rescuers, they will want to express their \ngratitude in person and continue to be thankful to a nation that \nrecognizes the value of each and every human life.\n  It strikes me that the Iraqi people's experience was much the same. \nNo doubt the captivity of their nation was longer, more brutal, and \nmore terrible than what our soldiers experienced. The pain of the Iraqi \npeople was immeasurable. But now, at long last, their country has \nreturned to them.\n  In 1944, Winston Churchill spoke in the Royal Albert Hall to the \nBritish troops and reminded them that they served a cause greater than \nthemselves. He said:\n\n       We are joined together in this union of action which has \n     been forced upon us by our common hatred of tyranny. Shedding \n     our blood side by side, struggling for the same ideals, until \n     the triumph of the great causes which we serve shall be made \n     manifest. . . . Then, indeed, there will be a day of \n     thanksgiving, one in which all the world will share.\n\n  There is a lot of work to be done in Iraq. But the difference our \nforces have made in such a short time is undeniable. Just a few short \nmonths ago, the idea that the Iraqi people could live free was a \nconcept that some found hard to treat seriously. Now the dream of a \nfree Iraq is in sight. The day of thanksgiving is not here yet, but it \nis coming. And thanks to the sacrifices of American families and \nAmerica's warriors, it is coming soon.\n  We as a grateful nation continue to wish our men and women in uniform \ngodspeed, and we hope and pray for their swift return to the loving \narms of their families.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I further ask consent that following the vote, the President \nimmediately be notified of the Senate's action. I also ask consent that \non Monday, May 5, at a time determined by the majority leader after \nconsultation with the Democratic leader, the Senate proceed to \nexecutive session for the consideration of Calendar No. 34, the \nnomination of Deborah Cook to be a U.S. district judge for the Sixth \nCircuit; provided further there be 4 hours for debate equally divided \nbetween the chairman and ranking member or their designees. Further, I \nask that following the use or yielding of that time the Senate proceed \nto a vote on the confirmation of the nomination, again with no \nintervening action.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I ask that the consent be modified so we have a vote on \nPrado at 2:15 today.\n  Mr. FRIST. I believe that was the way it was requested.\n  Mr. REID. I am sorry. I missed that. I was visiting with someone \nelse.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the \ndistinguished majority leader wishes to have a vote on Cook at 4:45 on \nMonday. Is that true?\n  Mr. FRIST. That is correct. The first vote on Monday will be 4:45, \nand that would be on the Cook nomination.\n  Mr. REID. I ask consent that that be part of what we are doing today. \nI ask consent that the vote occur at 4:45 and there be a period prior \nto that of 4 hours for debate on the Cook nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. And that 1 hour of that time be reserved for Senator \nKennedy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I thank all of the Senators who have been \ninvolved in leadership on the Democratic side and the Republican side \nin working on this agreement. I particularly thank Senator McConnell \nfor his perseverance and counsel over the course of the past several \ndays. Both sides have worked in good faith to come to this conclusion.\n  I now would ask for a further clarification with respect to the \nnomination of John Roberts. That nomination will be reported a week \nfrom today. We have been assured by the other side of the aisle that \nthere would be no filibuster on the nomination of John Roberts; also, \nthat the Senate would vote up or down on his confirmation. I know \nMembers will want to speak on that nomination and we will be prepared \nto provide time on Thursday for that debate.\n  I, therefore, expect that prior to completing our business next week \nwe will vote on the nomination. I yield to my colleague with regard to \nthis understanding.\n\n  Mr. REID. The statement of the Senator is absolutely correct. There \nwill be no filibuster. I would only ask, as the Senator has already \nindicated, that there be ample time--it may take as much as 6 hours of \ndebate--prior to a vote on that. The Senator said it would be on \nThursday. It may have to spill over until Friday. We may not be able to \ndo all 6 hours on Thursday.\n  I was just saying--I know the Senator was preoccupied--we may take as \nmuch as 6 hours, 3 hours on our side; the other side may not need as \nmuch time, and so we may not be able to complete all that on Thursday. \nThat is strictly up to the leader, but we have already indicated we \nwould need up to that much time.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I want to make sure there is adequate time \nfor debate. I would like to try to have the vote by the end of next \nweek, if at all possible.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senator McConnell and I worked as much as we \ncould to get this to a point where we are today. I do not like to \nacknowledge this often, but we were unable to do that. It was only \nbecause of the intervention of the two leaders that we were able to \narrive at this point. We need not go into all the details of what went \ninto this agreement, but I want to publicly acknowledge the good work \nof the Democratic leader and the majority leader in allowing us to get \nto this point. This has been done very quickly on the Senate floor, but \nto arrive at this point has taken literally hours of time.\n  This is a significant breakthrough. I think, with all the difficulty \nwe have been having with judicial nominations, that this is a \nsignificant advancement. It is typical of what has to be done when \ndealing with legislation. A lot of people have to give up what they \nfelt was something they could not give up.\n  I also would say that Senator Hatch and Senator Leahy have been \ninvolved. I think they have helped the advancement of the Senate by \ntheir agreeing to things to which a little while ago they\n\n[[Page S5631]]\n\nwould not have agreed. I wish to publicly commend the two leaders, and \nthe chairman of the committee and the ranking member of the Judiciary \nCommittee, Senators Hatch and Leahy, for some excellent work. This is \nnot anything that will ever be written in the history books but in my \nmind I have some knowledge of what is good for the Senate and I am \nconvinced that what we have done today is some of the best work we have \ndone all year.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his comments and \nagree wholeheartedly in terms of the efforts that have been made in \ngood faith on both sides of the aisle. It has been difficult in terms \nof negotiations but everybody has been involved at the leadership \nlevel, as well as working with the respective leaders of the committee. \nWe have come to a satisfactory conclusion. By the end of next week we \nwill have accomplished the goals we all have, and that is to keep the \nprocess working--it is not always pretty--in a way that will deliver \nwhat the American people deserve.\n  We will have more to say later today, but we will expect to have two \nvotes on Monday, the first at 4:45 and then a vote later, which we will \nset up the time agreement probably an hour or so after that vote, with \nconsideration to Miguel Estrada. Again, we will make specific \nannouncements but we will have two votes on Monday. I point out the \nfirst one is at 4:45, which we have tried to announce a few days ago to \nmake sure people are back for that particular vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the distinguished \nSenator from New York, Mrs. Clinton, and I control the next half hour \nas if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we rise today to discuss the call of a \nbipartisan coalition for some badly needed sunshine in the process of \nawarding Iraqi reconstruction contracts. I particularly commend several \nof my colleagues for joining me in the bipartisan legislation, the \nSunshine in Iraqi Reconstruction Contracting Act introduced April 10.\n  First, Senator Clinton and I are especially grateful to the chair of \nthe Governmental Affairs Committee, Senator Collins of Maine. Not only \nis she an excellent chair of the committee that will take up this \nlegislation, she is also an expert on procurement law, a real authority \non the very issue we have addressed in our legislation. We are very \nproud to have her as our lead bipartisan coalition builder on this \nlegislation because her leadership qualities on the committee and \nspecial proficiency on this topic give me great confidence this bill is \nthe right move for America, the right move for the Senate, particularly \nthe right move for our taxpayers, and we are very grateful for Senator \nCollins' support and participation in this effort.\n  Our legislation has a simple aim. It says if a Federal agency awards \nan Iraqi reconstruction contract without the benefit of open and \ncompetitive bidding, that agency must publicly justify their decision \nto do so. I will tell the Senate and my colleagues the events and news \nreports of the 21 days since our bill's introduction have only \nstrengthened our bipartisan conviction that Iraqi reconstruction \ncontracts must be awarded in the sunshine and not behind a smokescreen.\n  There are two primary reasons we believe it is so important American \ntaxpayers deserve additional details about this closed and secretive \nprocess. First, there is a huge amount of money on the line, a \nprojected $100 billion in taxpayer funds. Second, the General \nAccounting Office has already reported sole-source or limited-source \ncontracts almost always are not the best buy for the taxpayer.\n  In my view, the need for explanation increases a hundredfold if \nFederal agencies are going to employ a process that may expose \ntaxpayers to additional cost. When we introduced this legislation, we \nwere concerned that the U.S. Agency on International Development had \nalready awarded four of eight major Iraqi contracts through a closed \nbid or no-bid process. Even at that time, sole-source and limited-\nsource contracts already seemed to be the rule and not the exception \nfor rebuilding Iraq. USAID announced it would limit competition to \ncompanies they felt had the technical ability and accounting ability to \nhandle these matters.\n  But since our legislation was introduced, not only have a number of \nFederal agencies continued to award no-bid or closed-bid contracts, but \nonce the bids have been solicited, they even started to ignore or \ncircumvent their own publicly stated criteria for limiting the pool of \napplicants. More than ever, our bipartisan coalition believes if the \nFederal Government chooses not to use free market competition to get \nthe most reasonable price from the most qualified contractor, then at a \nminimum they should tell the American people why that is necessary. \nSunshine is the best disinfectant and the news reports of recent days \nsimply beg for a clearing of the air.\n\n  On April 11, the day after we introduced our bill, one firm secured a \n$2 million Iraq school contract through an invitation-only process. On \nApril 18, USAID awarded the biggest contract yet through an invitation-\nonly bid process. A $680 million contract to rebuild Iraq's \ninfrastructure was awarded to Bechtel. On April 19, a $50 million \npolicing contract was awarded through a closed bidding process. On the \nsame day, the Washington Post reported that a renewable $7.9 billion \ncontract for personnel services in Iraqi reconstruction was awarded \nFebruary 25, nearly a month before the war began, with a single company \ninvited to bid for the job. According to the press reports, that \ninvitation came a full 55 days before the start of the hostilities.\n  As each of the contracts was awarded, Federal agencies justified the \nno-bid or closed-bid process only by saying that they simply had to \nmove quickly. That is basically one of the only arguments the agencies \nhave left. Originally, USAID said the only companies with security \nclearances could be invited to apply. But that argument fell apart just \na couple of days ago. USAID's own inspector general revealed that USAID \nwaived the security clearance requirement when one bid was awarded. It \nturned out that the winner of a $4 million ports contract, in fact, did \nnot have the security clearance that was supposedly essential when the \nlimited bid process started. In effect, USAID eliminated the very \ncriteria it used to limit bidders on the project. USAID suddenly said \nthe outbreak of war in Iraq simply made the security clearance process \nunnecessary.\n  The only reason the United States would be awarding contracting to \nrebuild Iraq would be if the United States went to war. So if the \nrequirement for security clearance was needed before the war broke out, \nit is hard to see what would have changed once the war started. As a \nMember of the Senate Intelligence Committee, I thought the argument was \na bit shaky at the outset. I was not certain why you would need all of \nthe security clearances to fix the sewer system. Weeks ago, it was \nclear that most of the Iraqi work would be subcontracted out to \ncompanies who did not meet the security requirements in the first \nplace. But the report from the inspector general this week has \nsignificantly increased my concern. It turned the agency's argument \nabout security clearances from suspect to essentially ludicrous.\n  This incident makes the case better than any other that agencies \nshould have to clearly and publicly state how they are choosing \ncompanies for these invitation-only bids. Perhaps if they know they \nhave to face the public on these issues they will have better \nexplanations or a more open process.\n  We want to be clear, in the presence of actual security concerns, our \nlegislation assures the protection of classified information. But at \nthe same time, it does give the Congress oversight over the billions in \ntaxpayer money that Americans are being asked to commit in Iraq and \nthat is desperately needed. Historically, open and competitive bidding \nby Federal agencies has been the tool to get the best value for the \ntaxpayers of our Nation.\n  Again, independent reports from the General Accounting Office show \nthat in the past, the soul-source or limited-source contracts have not \nbeen before the buy. According to the General Accounting Office, \nmilitary leaders have\n\n[[Page S5632]]\n\noften simply accepted the level of services given by a contractor \nwithout ever asking if it could be done more efficiently or at a lower \ncost. In the case of Iraq, again, with estimates being low-balled at \n$25 billion and some exceeding $100 billion, taxpayers in our country \nhave a great interest in making sure this money is spent efficiently.\n  I also note in wrapping up that many of these contracts are so-called \ncost-plus contracts. They pay a company's expenses, plus a guaranteed \nprofit of 1 to 8 percent. There are no limits on total costs, so the \nmore a firm charges in expenses, the more profit it is going to make. \nIf the Federal Government is going to spend the money of the people of \nOregon in this fashion without asking for competitive bids, I think the \npeople of Oregon and the people of this country deserve to know why. \nThere simply should not be a place for waste when you are talking about \nat least $100 billion of taxpayers' cash.\n  I understand the argument that these contracts need to be awarded \nquickly. I understand in many cases the companies receiving them have a \nlong history of international work. I simply believe if the need for \nspeed can adequately justify these closed-bid processes that may expose \nthe taxpayers to additional expenditures, then those agencies need to \nmake public why they would take these extraordinary measures that could \nvery well waste significant amounts of taxpayer money.\n  I want to yield my time to Senator Clinton. I thank her. She is on \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee. She and I and Senator Collins have \nbeen a bipartisan coalition.\n  I would also like to note a number of other Senators--Senator Byrd in \nparticular, who serves on the Appropriations Committee and the Armed \nServices Committee--have been very helpful as well. But I yield to \nSenator Clinton and particularly express my support to her. With \nSenator Collins, we have tried to make the focus that there is a \nbipartisan need for protecting taxpayers, to make sure this money is \nspent wisely at a time when there is so much economic hurt across the \nNation.\n  I yield to the distinguished Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, will my distinguished colleague yield \nfor a question?\n  Mr. WYDEN. I will.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, it is a great privilege to be working in \nthis bipartisan coalition with the chairman of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, Senator Collins, and with a long-time champion of taxpayers \nand consumers like Senator Wyden.\n  Is it the understanding of the Senator from Oregon that the buck \nreally stops with Congress? It is the Congress's responsibility to \nensure the funds we appropriate for reconstruction in Iraq are spent in \na fair and open manner?\n  Mr. WYDEN. The Senator from New York has summed it up. This is \nCongress's call. The buck in fact does stop with the Congress.\n  What we are talking about here is making sure Congress keeps in place \nvigorous oversight about the process. The process is what has, in our \nview, put taxpayers' dollars in some peril. People have focused on one \ncompany or another. There are inquiries underway. What we are going to \ndo is protect the process that ensures, as the Senator from New York \nsuggests, that the taxpayers are protected and Congress in fact has the \nlast word in making sure this money is spent responsibly.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, that is an eloquent summation as to why \nI have joined with my colleagues in introducing the Sunshine In Iraqi \nReconstruction Contracting Bill.\n  Tonight President Bush will address our Nation and will tell the \nworld that Operation Iraqi Freedom's military action is over, at least \ninsofar as major military engagements may be required. We know we will \nhave continuing problems, like those we have seen in the last few days. \nBut it is true we are now moving toward the second phase, which is the \nrebuilding of Iraq. So this colloquy we are having today is especially \ntimely because of the President's announcement this evening.\n  With respect to our going forward, I think the important points the \nSenator from Oregon has made need to be underscored because, for many \nof us, we want to see the plans that have been explained in the last \nseveral weeks about the rebuilding effort move forward as expeditiously \nand cost-effectively as possible.\n  We know, as we just heard from the distinguished Senator, that a \nnumber of contracts have already been let. They have been no-bid or \nclosed-bid contracts. As one follows the information about these \ncontracts in the press, it has become clearer and clearer this has been \nin the planning for quite some time and it has been largely the \nprovince of a rather small group of insiders.\n  I think it is imperative, not only for the integrity of our \nprocurement process, for the integrity of the congressional \nappropriation and oversight process, but for the integrity of the \nentire operation that has been undertaken in Iraq, to be transparent \nand open before the world.\n  If I may ask the Senator from Oregon another question, is it correct \nthe legislation we have introduced would require when contracts are \nawarded without a full and open competition, behind closed doors, that \nthe awarding agency--whether it is the Department of Defense or USAID--\nwould have to publicly explain why they could not have had an open \nprocess?\n  Mr. WYDEN. The Senator is correct. Again, that is what the \nlegislation is about. There is a certain irony in that that information \nis in fact already available. The bipartisan legislation we have put \ntogether with the Chair of the Governmental Affairs Committee, Senator \nCollins, says what is already completed work, in terms of the analysis \nand justification, simply would be made public so as to reinforce the \nproposition that there be the maximum amount of transparency, the \nmaximum amount of accountability, and so the public can see why, if \nnecessary, a special process that doesn't involve open bids would be \nnecessary.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. You know, our bill also requires as part of that \ntransparency, letting the sunshine come in, that the agencies would \nmake public the amount of the contract, the scope of the contract, \nwould provide information about how contractors were identified, as \nwell as the justification and determination of the documents that led \nto the decision not to use full and open competition.\n  I find that very reassuring. I do not understand why this would not \nbe legislation we could literally pass by unanimous consent this \nafternoon. I don't think it is in our Government's interest nor is it \nin America's interest that there be any doubt at all, any shadow cast \nover this process so people in our own country or elsewhere can say \nthere is something funny going on, this is not being done straight.\n  Would the Senator agree, in addition to fulfilling what we know to be \nthe appropriate procurement procedures, the fact that no-bid or closed-\nbid contracts time and time again lead to overruns, to excessive costs, \nthat we are also, through this legislation, trying to send a warning, \nin a sense holding out a helping hand to the Government, to say let's \ndo this in the open so nobody can ever go back and question motive or \nprocess with respect to what we are attempting to do with the \nreconstruction of Iraq?\n  Mr. WYDEN. The point of the Senator about the credibility of the \nGovernment I think is fundamental. I think we all know if people see \nsomething taking place behind closed doors, in secret, without the open \nand full process of competitive bidding, it just engenders suspicion, \nit just engenders a sense of skepticism and cynicism about government \nthat just does not have to be.\n  It is particularly troubling here because the General Accounting \nOffice, the nonpartisan organization of auditors, has already \ndocumented there is a problem. So we have a combination of taxpayer \nskepticism about work done in secret coupled with the long history of \nthe General Accounting Office's skepticism about these reports, and \nhere is an area that just cries out for sunshine.\n  I talked about sunshine being the best disinfectant, but certainly \nsince we introduced this bill with Senator Collins over the last 21 \ndays, the fact we have seen all these contracts--in fact, one of them \nwhere the agency just waives their own process, without an \nexplanation--I think highlights the Senator's point that the \nGovernment's credibility is at stake.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I hope we will have an even larger \nbipartisan\n\n[[Page S5633]]\n\ncoalition supporting this legislation, working with us, perhaps even \nconvincing the Government agencies responsible for letting these \ncontracts to think very hard about the process they are now following.\n  Again, I thank my colleague from Oregon and my colleague from Maine \nfor providing such leadership. It is a pleasure to work with them. But \nit is also a duty. I think all of us feel a heavy responsibility to \nmake sure the billions and billions of dollars--maybe as much as $100 \nbillion that will be spent on reconstructing Iraq--is spent in the most \neffective way. Because, while we are looking at the extraordinary costs \nof this kind of task awaiting us in Iraq, we are also in this body \nhearing from our constituents, as many of us did over the previous 2 \nweeks, about what is happening to their schools, what is happening to \ntheir hospitals.\n  So we have to be especially conscious that this money can be \njustified; that we can look our constituents in the eyes when they say, \nI don't understand, Senator. I thought we were going to get more help \nfor our poor schools. Senator, I don't understand. Our hospital has \njust closed down because we can't get enough reimbursements from the \nFederal Government.\n\n  This is not only about all of the good government principles. It is \nnot even only about the integrity and credibility of our government. It \nis about the choices that are being made. These choices are not only \nimportant with respect to contracting, but they are important with \nrespect to our values.\n  I hope our colleagues will join us in moving this piece of important \nlegislation through so that we can begin to practice what many of us \npreach about transparency and openness and also making sure we get the \nvery best deal. Our dollars are limited. If there is any excess on \njustified dollars going to Iraq that could go to my kids and schools in \nNew York City, or to Ron's hospital in Oregon, that is our \nresponsibility.\n  Let me again thank my colleagues. I look forward to being successful \nwith this bipartisan coalition and getting this legislation passed at \nthe earliest possible time.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, to wrap up, I would like to reaffirm a \npoint that the distinguished Senator from New York mentioned with \nrespect to the feeling of our citizens at a time when there are so many \nschools that are underfunded and seniors can't afford their medicine \nand other services. When I was home over the break--perhaps the Senator \nfrom New York heard this as well--many constituents came up to me and \nsaid: We are really glad that you are pushing this bill at more \ncompetitive bidding and reconstruction contracts. But, to tell you the \ntruth, why don't you just have Iraqi oil pay for all of the \nreconstruction? We don't need the taxpayer money.\n  There already is a sense about the Nation that we have to be careful \nabout how these funds are being used. I think there is a role for the \nUnited States to play. I think it is clear that is a part of an \nimportant contribution that our country can make with the conflict \nwinding down. But it just reaffirms in my mind how critical it is to \nuse this money wisely. With the American people hurting now with what \none might say is the highest unemployment rate of our country, you \ncan't explain to the taxpayers of this Nation frittering away dollars \non contracts that are let without competitive bids.\n  We look forward to colleagues of both political parties joining us in \nthis effort. It seems to me a bill such as this should be passed \nunanimously with all 100 Senators onboard. We look forward to seeing \nthe resolution of this legislation to protect the taxpayers.\n  Again, I want to close by expressing my thanks to the chairman of the \ncommittee where this legislation was sent. Senator Collins has been a \ncritical partner in this effort to direct procurement law. Senator \nByrd, who holds, of course, a longstanding interest in this matter and \nserves on both the Appropriations and the Armed Services Committees, \nhas been invaluable to me in particular in providing counsel with \nrespect to how to move this legislation forward. Together we look \nforward to passing this bill and protecting the taxpayers' interests as \nperhaps $100 billion of taxpayer money is spent in the rebuilding of \nIraq.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/01/senate-section/article/S5633-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5633-S5639]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n NOMINATION OF EDWARD C.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will now proceed to the consideration of Executive Calendar No. \n105, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Edward C. \nPrado, of Texas, to be United States Circuit Judge for the Fifth \nCircuit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for the \nnext 15 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. DeWine are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, on behalf of the majority leader Frist, I \nask unanimous consent that the vote on Executive Calendar No. 105, the \nnomination of Edward C. Prado, occur at 2:05 p.m. today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am pleased we are going to move to the \nnomination of Judge Edward Prado. While my friend, the distinguished \nsenior Senator from Ohio, is on the floor, I want to extend early \ncongratulations because it appears that on Monday we are going to \napprove a judge on which he has worked so hard. Because of his advocacy \nand a number of others, we have been able to move through this circuit \ncourt process a little more quickly. The Senator from Ohio told me how \nmuch he thought of Judge Cook, and being the fine lawyer the Senator \nis, I am certain we are going to get a good addition to the court. His \nrecommendation goes a long way with me. I congratulate the Senator from \nOhio for his advocacy on the part of someone he knows and speaks so \nwell of.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased we now are on the nomination of Judge \nEdward Prado, a well-qualified nominee for the Fifth Circuit Court of \nAppeals. Judge Prado is being considered for the same court as Justice \nPriscilla Owen, a nominee we on this side find to be a divisive choice \nfor the circuit court. The swift consideration of Judge Prado's \nnomination illustrates again how the nomination process can work when \nthe President sends up fairminded and mainstream choices for lifetime \nseats on our Federal bench. It happens quickly.\n  This came about as a result of our being involved in another judicial \nnomination that was not going anywhere, and on this side we moved to \nthe nomination of Judge Prado. I think that and other reasons moved us \nalong the path very quickly.\n  While some have decried the confirmation process is broken, certainly \nthe numbers belie that charge. With the two district court judges \nconfirmed before we recessed and Mr. Sutton on Tuesday, the number of \nconfirmations has already risen to 120. This afternoon it will be 121. \nThese numbers dwarf the confirmations achieved by my Republican \ncolleagues under President Clinton.\n  Last year alone, in an election year, the Democratic-led Senate \nconfirmed 72 judicial nominees, more than in any of the prior 6 years \nof Republican control. Overall, in the 17 months of Senate Democratic \ncontrol, we were able to confirm 100 judges and vastly reduce judicial \nvacancies. We were able to do so despite the refusal of the \nadministration to consult with Democrats on circuit court vacancies and \nmany district court vacancies.\n  As I have indicated, if we confirm Judge Prado, which I am confident \nwe will do, he will be the 121st judge. He will also be the 11th Latino \njudge serving in our circuit courts. Judge Prado is supported by the \nCongressional Hispanic Caucus, the Mexican American Legal Defense Fund, \nand many others.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the Congressional Hispanic \nCaucus expressing their unanimous support be printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S5634]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                   April 29, 2003.\n     Hon. Bill Frist,\n     U.S. Senate Majority Leader,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Frist: On behalf of the Congressional \n     Hispanic Caucus (CHC), we write today regarding Edward \n     Charles Prado's nomination to the United States Court of \n     Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. Earlier this year, the CHC \n     voted unanimously to endorse the nomination of Judge Prado. \n     Subsequently, Judge Prado received the unanimous bipartisan \n     support of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and it is our \n     understanding that Senate Democratic leadership has since \n     asked that this non-controversial nomination be immediately \n     called up for a vote.\n       Unfortunately, it is now being reported that Senate \n     Republican leadership is holding up confirmation of Judge \n     Prado as part of a political ploy to characterize Democratic \n     opposition to certain individual judicial nominees as a \n     Democratic assault on women and minorities. If this in fact \n     is the case, then it is reprehensible that the Senate \n     Republican leadership would engage in such offensive and \n     malicious tactics for mere political gain.\n       It is ironic that although Judge Prado has received \n     bipartisan and unanimous support so far, Republican \n     leadership has not yet allowed the full Senate a final vote \n     on his nomination. Intentionally delaying a vote on this \n     nomination casts doubt on the sincerity of Republican \n     rhetoric about supporting and confirming qualified Hispanic \n     judges.\n       Furthermore, it would be a travesty for Judge Prado, a \n     qualified and respected Hispanic judicial nominee, to fall \n     victim to a disingenuous politically motivated campaign to \n     label Democrats as anti-minority by highlighting Democratic \n     opposition to a select few while ignoring Democratic support \n     for the vast majority of President Bush's Hispanic judicial \n     nominees.\n       President Bush's nominations of Jose Martinez to a District \n     Court in Florida, Jose Linares to a District Court in New \n     Jersey, Christina Armijo to a District Court in New Mexico, \n     James Otero to a District Court in California, as well as \n     Alia Ludlum, Philip Martinez, and Randy Crane to District \n     Courts in Texas all received Democratic support and all were \n     confirmed by the U.S. Senate. In addition to Judge Prado, \n     another pending Hispanic judicial nominee, Cecilia Altonaga \n     of Florida, is also expected to be confirmed by the Senate \n     with Democratic support.\n       Clearly, Senate Democrats have displayed a willingness to \n     support President Bush's Hispanic nominees, and any \n     assertions to the contrary are unnecessary and \n     counterproductive to efforts to increase diversity on our \n     Nation's federal courts.\n       As you know, the judicial nomination process is important \n     to the CHC because we believe that our Nation's courts should \n     reflect the diversity of thought and action that enrich \n     America. To that extent, we established the Hispanic \n     Judiciary Initiative to further formalize our involvement in \n     this issue by establishing a set of evaluation criteria and \n     an internal process for endorsing nominees. Since its \n     inception the CHC Hispanic Judiciary Initiative has worked to \n     improve diversity within the federal judiciary. For this \n     effort to be hindered due to political maneuvering, absent \n     concern for the best interest of the Hispanic community, is \n     both irresponsible and neglectful.\n       Once again, we believe that Judge Prado's qualifications \n     and distinguished career in law, as well as his dedication to \n     the Hispanic community make him a judicial nominee deserving \n     of confirmation. We respectfully urge you to schedule a vote \n     to conform Edward Charles Prado to the United States Court of \n     Appeals for the Fifth Circuit without any further delay.\n           Sincerely,\n     Ciro D. Rodriguez,\n       Chair, Congressional Hispanic Caucus\n     Charles A. Gonzalez,\n       Chair, CHC Hispanic Judiciary Initiative.\n\n  Mr. REED. Judge Prado has served 19 years in the United States \ndistrict court. As some of my colleagues have noted, it is sometimes \nmore challenging to review nominees who come to us from private \npractice and universities. We have to extrapolate from their record in \nthose different roles as to how they would perform as a judge. With \nJudge Prado, we certainly do not have that problem. We know how he has \nperformed as a judge.\n  With the nomination of Priscilla Owen, the same applies. We have the \nPriscilla Owen and Judge Prado judicial records we can directly \nevaluate. In the case of Justice Owen, it is a record many on our side \nfind troubling. If all the Members had been present today, it would \nhave been 47 people voting against cloture.\n  In the case of Judge Prado, it is a record we find evinces an \nevenhandedness and fairness befitting a circuit court judge. Not that I \nwould decide every case the way Judge Prado has--I would not--but \noverall he has won the support of all Democratic Senators, as far as I \nknow, on the Judiciary Committee, and other Democratic Senators, \nbecause they found his record one of balance and fairness. Unlike \nJustice Owen and Mr. Estrada, no colleague or supervisor has questioned \nhis ability to apply the law faithfully. Unlike Justice Owen and Mr. \nEstrada, no single person or organization has submitted a letter of \nconcern or opposition to Judge Prado's nomination.\n  Judge Prado has generated no controversy. He is experienced. While I \nam sure he is conservative, it does not matter; He is an evenhanded \njudge.\n  There is something to be said for conservative judges. If \nconservatism means the law is followed, stare decisis, the precedent \nset, I think that is good.\n  Judge Prado will be confirmed today because he is a fine person and \nan excellent judge. As I have noted in the past, eight of the sitting \nLatino judges were appointed by President Clinton. Several of these \njudges were denied Senate consideration for years while the Republicans \ncontrolled the Senate. Judge Richard Paez, nominee for the Ninth \nCircuit, waited over 1,500 days. He was well qualified, had the support \nof his hometown Senators, and 39 Republicans voted against his \nnomination. There is nothing wrong with that. They had different views \nas to how he would serve as a judge.\n  Judge Sonia Sotomayor, a nominee to the Second Circuit, was similarly \nstalled. Her confirmation took 433 days. Then there were the Hispanic \nnominees who were denied hearings or votes by Republicans during the \nClinton administration: Jorge Rangel, Enrique Moreno, Christine \nArguello, Richard Morado, Anabelle Rodriquez.\n  These facts and the expected confirmation of Judge Prado belie the \nanti-Hispanic charges some have made in the context of the Estrada \ndebate. The extended debate Democrats have sought to have on just a \nhandful of judicial nominees affects our constitutional advice and \nconsent duty.\n  While the number of judges who have been confirmed demonstrates our \ngood faith in working with our colleagues and the President, we will \nnot simply rubberstamp ideologically driven individuals for lifetime \nseats on our Federal courts.\n  I am pleased that today we are moving forward on this qualified \njudge, Edward Prado. I believe the way Judge Prado's nomination has \nbeen received in the Senate points the way through some of the conflict \nthat has occurred in the Senate over a very small number of judicial \nnominees.\n  If my math is correct, by today's end there will be 121 versus 2. \nThat is a good record in anyone's book.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, as I understand it we are on the Prado \nnomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased that we are considering the \nnomination of Edward C. Prado, who has been nominated by President Bush \nto serve on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. \nHe has an outstanding record of distinguished public service and will \nbe a great addition to the Fifth Circuit, especially since the seat to \nwhich he has been nominated has been designated a judicial emergency by \nthe Judicial Conference of the United States.\n  Judge Prado currently serves as a United States District Judge for \nthe Western District of Texas, having been unanimously confirmed by the \nSenate in 1984. His 18 years on the bench, plus prior service as a \nTexas state court district judge has given him the experience and \nbackground to make an outstanding Fifth Circuit Judge.\n  In addition to his judicial experience, Judge Prado has had a \ndistinguished legal career. After graduating from the University of \nTexas School of Law in 1972, he began his legal career as an Assistant \nDistrict Attorney in the Bexar County, TX, District Attorney's Office. \nIn 1976 he accepted a position with the Federal Public Defender's \nOffice for the\n\n[[Page S5635]]\n\nWestern District of Texas where he served as an Assistant Federal \nPublic Defender representing indigent criminal defendants in the \nfederal courts.\n  During 1980, he served as a Texas state district judge, filling the \nunexpired term of the incumbent. In this position, he presided over \nseveral hundred cases, including felony criminal trials. In 1981, he \nwas unanimously confirmed by the Senate and appointed as United States \nAttorney for the Western District of Texas, where he managed one of the \nlargest United States Attorney's Offices in the Nation. In 1984, \nPresident Reagan nominated and the Senate confirmed Judge Prado as a \nUnited States District Judge for the Western District of Texas. In this \ncapacity he has handled thousands of cases and hundreds of trials.\n  Judge Prado is a man of exceptional character, impeccable ethics, and \nis well qualified to serve as a Circuit Judge. He has received many \nhonors and awards for his work in the law, including the St. Thomas \nMoore Award from St. Mary's University School of Law in 2000, the LULAC \nState Award for Excellence in 1981, the Achievement Award from the U.S. \nAttorney General in 1980, and recognition as an Outstanding Federal \nPublic Defender in 1978.\n  Judge Prado is a native of San Antonio, Texas and has served his \ncommunity, state and nation in a variety of ways. Not only has he \nserved in his professional capacity, but also he believes in community \nservice and has been involved in community service organizations such \nas St. Mark's Catholic Church, Witte Museum Community Advisory \nCommittee, the Philosophical Society of Texas, the Rotary Club of San \nAntonio, and Leadership San Antonio. Additionally, Judge Prado served \nin the U.S. Army Reserve as an Infantry Officer from 1972-1987.\n  In addition to his public and community service, Judge Prado has been \nactively involved in efforts to improve the legal and judicial process. \nHe has been a leader in numerous bar associations and law-related \norganizations. For example, he has been a member of the Texas and San \nAntonio Bar Associations since 1972, including service as President, \nand later Director and Chairman of the Board of Trustees, of the San \nAntonio Bar Foundation. Judge Prado serves on the Texas State Bar Crime \nVictims Committee, and was appointed by Chief Justice Rehnquist to \nserve as the Chairman of the Criminal Justice Act Review Committee from \n1991-1993.\n  As a District Judge, he has made efforts to reach out to youth groups \nto help them learn about the law and the judicial process. He gives \nmotivational speeches and conducts events in his courtroom as an \nintroduction to the law.\n  Judge Prado comes highly recommended by those with whom he serves and \nby those who appear in his courtroom. Let me read a few statements made \nby Texas attorneys, as reported in the Texas Lawyer, February 10, 2003. \nLaurence R. Macon said of Judge Prado, ``I've known him for 30 years, \nand he doesn't have any outrageous positions. He won't be there trying \nto make law.'' Seagal Wheatley stated, ``If the Judiciary Committee \nlooks at his qualifications, he should be a shoo-in. I'm not aware of \nany recent opinion that will cause him problems.'' A third attorney, \nVan Hilley, said, ``Judge Prado has a varied background and an open \nmind about things. The reason his docket ran so smooth is he wasn't \nviewed as pro-government or pro-defense.''\n  The legal bar's wide regard for Judge Prado is reflected in his \nevaluation by the American Bar Association. The ABA evaluates judicial \nnominees based on their professional qualifications, their integrity, \ntheir professional competence, and their judicial temperament. The ABA \nhas bestowed upon Judge Prado its highest rating of Unanimously Well \nQualified.\n  Furthermore, Judge Prado has been endorsed by his hometown newspaper, \nThe San Antonio Express-News, which declared, ``The Senate should \nconfirm Prado's nomination without undue controversy or delay. . . . \nHis credentials are unquestioned.'' Mr. President, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the complete San Antonio Express-News editorial be printed \nin the Record, following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection it is so ordered. (See \nexhibit No. 1)\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the record is clear that Judge Prado is a \nman of ability and character. This Senate, on two previous occasions, \nhas found Judge Prado worthy of confirmation for positions of high \nresponsibility in the government, and I am confident it will do so \nagain today. I strongly support his confirmation and urge my colleagues \nto do likewise.\n\n                             Exhibit No. 1\n\n       U.S. District Judge Edward C. Prado has compiled an \n     admirable record in his almost two decades on the federal \n     trial bench.\n       Last week, President Bush nominated the San Antonio judge \n     for a well-deserved promotion to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court \n     of Appeals.\n       The Senate should confirm Prado's nomination without undue \n     controversy or delay.\n       Prado, a graduate of Edgewood High School, was appointed to \n     his federal district court post by President Reagan in 1984 \n     and has performed consistently as a non-ideological moderate.\n       His credentials are unquestioned. Prado first became a \n     judge in 1980 when Gov. Bill Clements named him to a state \n     district court bench.\n       In addition, U.S. Sens. Kay Bailey Hutchison and John \n     Cornyn of Texas swiftly recommended a solid replacement for \n     Prado if he is elevated.\n       The lawmakers forwarded the name of former Texas Supreme \n     Court Justice Xavier Rodriguez of San Antonio to the White \n     House to fill Prado's seat.\n       Gov. Rick Perry appointed Rodriguez to the state's high \n     court, but he was defeated in last year's GOP primary.\n       A bright lawyer with solid legal qualifications, Rodriguez \n     was apolitical before being appointed to the Texas Supreme \n     Court, and that is one of many factors that make him a strong \n     candidate for a federal bench.\n       We urge Bush to accept the recommendation of the Texas \n     senators and nominate Rodriguez when Prado's post is \n     officially vacated.\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the nomination of \nJudge Edward Prado to be a Circuit Court Judge for the Fifth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals. Judge Prado has earned my support and that of my \ncolleagues for his distinguished record in public service and for the \nintegrity with which he has gone through the Senate confirmation \nprocess.\n  Judge Prado has been a public servant for his entire professional \nlife. From the assistant district attorney position he took just after \nreceiving his law degree, to his experience as a U.S. attorney for the \nWestern District of Texas, to the 19 years he has served as a district \ncourt judge for the Western District of Texas, Judge Prado's commitment \nto public service is evident.\n  During his tenure as a Federal district court judge, Judge Prado has \nheard and decided hundreds of cases. This experience helps make him a \nwell-prepared and well-qualified nominee to the Fifth Circuit. He has \ndeveloped an extensive record of achievement for the Senate to consider \nand review in our endeavor to evaluate his nomination.\n  Further, Judge Prado should be commended both for his willingness to \nbe honest and forthcoming in the questionnaire he submitted to the \ncommittee, and for his comportment at his committee confirmation \nhearing. Judge Prado directly and fully addressed some of his more \ncontroversial rulings in his questionnaire, and provided honest, \ncomplete answers to all questions asked of him at his hearing. I do not \nagree with all of Judge Prado's decisions; in fact, we may hold \ndifferent views on significant issues. Yet I am convinced that he will \napply the law in a capable and responsible manner.\n  Finally, it should be noted that I support the elevation of Judge \nPrado to the Court of Appeals for the same reasons that make me unable \nto support the nomination of Miguel Estrada to the D.C. Circuit. Where \nJudge Prado has 19 years of experience on the Federal bench, Mr. \nEstrada has no experience of any kind as a judge. And, more \nimportantly, Judge Prado has voluntarily and directly addressed any \ncontroversial issues in his record, while Mr. Estrada has made a habit \nof concealing such information and refusing to submit documents which \nwould be of substantial assistance to the committee.\n  Mr. Prado is the kind of experienced, well-qualified nominee that the \nSenate can confirm with speed and ease. I support his nomination.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. I am happy to yield.\n\n[[Page S5636]]\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I know we have set a time. I wonder if the Senator from \nVermont might have a minute or so to speak about this nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Each side has 3 minutes remaining at this \ntime.\n  Mr. HATCH. I will yield to the distinguished Senator from Vermont, \nand I yield my remaining 3 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nTexas.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I begin by thanking the democratic leader \nand assistant leader for going to bat for Judge Edward Prado and \nworking out this arrangement with the Republican leadership so that \nthis consensus nomination can be considered without further delay. I \nappreciate that the majority leader and Senator McConnell have been \nwilling to work with us to allow this nomination to go forward today.\n  I was disappointed to hear on Tuesday that the Republican position \nwas that this matter should be further delayed and I did not understand \nthe logic or motivation behind that position.\n  I cannot recall a time when the Senate or either party leadership \ninsisted on strict adherence to consideration of nominations based on \ntheir calendar number. Indeed, during the period 1995 through 2001, \nquite the opposite was true and Democrats had to work very hard to get \nthe Republican leadership to take up nominations that were stalled on \nthe Senate Executive Calendar for weeks, months and sometimes years. \nThis year we have continued to make progress on filling judicial \nvacancies not by holding up all nominations reported after that of Mr. \nEstrada but, on the contrary, by moving to those on which there is \nagreement and on which we can proceed most efficiently.\n  In fact, all 20 judicial confirmations this year were nominations \nreported and considered after that of Mr. Estrada and after debate on \nthe Estrada nomination had begun.\n  We still do not know who on the Republican side delayed consideration \nof the consensus nomination of Judge Prado for the last month. I thank \nthe Congressional Hispanic Caucus for its support of this nomination \nand for working with the Senate to bring this matter forward at this \ntime. I also want to thank the Republican leadership for changing \nposition and working with us to move forward.\n  I came to the floor on Monday to make the point that the nomination \nof Judge Edward Prado to the United States Court of Appeals for the \nFifth Circuit was cleared on the Democratic side and that we were \nprepared to proceed. Senator Daschle and Senator Reid came before the \nSenate on Tuesday to urge that the Prado nomination be considered \nrather than be held captive on the Senate calendar. All Democratic \nSenators serving on the Judiciary Committee voted to report this \nnomination favorably. All Democratic Senators had indicated that they \nwere eager to proceed to this nomination and, after a reasonable period \nof debate, voting on the nomination. I am confident this nomination \nwill be confirmed by an extraordinary majority--maybe unanimously.\n  It is most unfortunate that so many partisans in this administration \nand on the other side of the aisle insist on bogging down consensus \nmatters and consensus nominees in order to focus exclusively on the \nmost divisive and controversial of this President's nominees as he \ncontinues his efforts to pack the courts. Democratic Senators have \nworked very hard to cooperate with this administration in order to fill \njudicial vacancies. What the other side seeks to obscure is that \neffort, that fairness and the progress we have been able to achieve \nwithout much help from the other side or the administration.\n  This week, again, despite Democratic willingness to proceed to a vote \non the controversial nomination of Jeffrey Sutton to the Sixth Circuit, \nthe other side then insisted we proceed to the unprecedented \nrenomination of Priscilla Owen. Mr. Sutton was confirmed with the \nfewest votes in favor of any judicial nominee in the last 20 years and \nwith more than enough negative votes to have sustained a filibuster. \nRather than proceed to a consensus nominee and fill a judicial \nemergency vacancy on the Fifth Circuit with an experienced and \nrespected Hispanic federal judge, Judge Prado, Republicans insisted on \npressing forward with another of the President's most controversial and \ndivisive nominations.\n  The fact is that when Democrats became the Senate majority in the \nsummer of 2001 we inherited 110 judicial vacancies. Over the next 17 \nmonths, despite constant criticism from the administration, the Senate \nproceeded to confirm 100 of President Bush's nominees, including \nseveral who were divisive and controversial, several who had mixed peer \nreview ratings from the ABA and at least one who had been rated not \nqualified. Despite the additional 40 vacancies that arose, we reduced \njudicial vacancies to 60, a level below that termed ``full employment'' \nby Senator Hatch. Since the beginning of this year, in spite of the \nfixation of the Republican majority on the President's most \ncontroversial nominations, we have worked hard to reduce judicial \nvacancies even further.\n  As of today, the Senate Judiciary Committee website lists the number \nof judicial vacancies at 48. That is the lowest it has been in 13 \nyears. That is lower than at any time during the entire eight years of \nthe Clinton administration. We have already reduced judicial vacancies \nfrom 110 to 48, in less than two years. We have reduced the vacancy \nrate from 12.8 percent to 5.6 percent, the lowest it has been in the \nlast two decades. With some cooperation from the administration think \nof the additional progress we could be making.\n  Even after the consideration of Judge Prado, for example, there is \nanother distinguished Hispanic nominee who was reported unanimously by \nthe Judiciary Committee last month on which the Senate will not yet \nhave acted: on the Senate executive calendar is the nomination of \nCecilia Altonaga to be a Federal judge in Florida. We expedited \nconsideration of this nominee at the request of Senator Graham of \nFlorida. She will be the first Cuban-American woman to be confirmed to \nthe Federal bench when Republicans choose to proceed to that \nnomination. Indeed, Democrats in the Senate have worked to expedite \nfair consideration of every Latino nominee this President has made to \nthe Federal trial courts in addition to the nomination of Judge Prado.\n  Another example may be the nomination of Consuelo Callahan to the \nNinth Circuit Court of Appeals. Unlike the divisive nomination of \nCarolyn Kuhl to the same court, both home State Senators returned their \nblue slips and support a hearing for Judge Consuelo Callahan. I have \nasked that she receive a hearing in the near future and look forward to \nlearning more about her record as an appellate judge for the State of \nCalifornia. Rather than disregarding time-honored rules and Senate \npractices, I urge my friends on the other side of the aisle to help us \nfill more judicial vacancies more quickly by bringing those nominations \nthat have bipartisan support to the front of the line for Committee \nhearings and floor votes.\n  As I have noted throughout the last 2 years, the Senate is able to \nmove expeditiously when we have consensus, mainstream nominees to \nconsider. Nationally-respected columnist David Broder made this point \nin an April 16 column that appeared in the Washington Post. I \nreferenced this column earlier this week and inserted it in the \nCongressional Record. In his column, Mr. Broder noted that when he \nasked Alberto Gonzales if there might be a lesson in Judge Prado's easy \napproval, Mr. Gonzales missed the point. In Mr. Broder's mind: ``The \nlesson seems obvious. Conservatives can be confirmed for the courts \nwhen they are well known in their communities and a broad range of \ntheir constituents have reason to think them fair-minded.''\n  To date the Senate has proceeded to confirm 120 of President Bush's \nnominees, 100 in the 17 months in which Democrats made up the Senate \nmajority. The lesson that less controversial nominees are considered \nand confirmed more easily was the lesson of the last two years and that \nlesson has been lost on this White House.\n  Unfortunately, far too many of this President's nominees raise \nserious concerns about whether they will be fair judges to all parties \non all issues. Those types of nominees should not be rushed through the \nprocess. I regret the administration's refusal to work\n\n[[Page S5637]]\n\nwith us to end the impasse it has created in connection with the \nEstrada nomination.\n  The partisan politics of division that the administration is \npracticing with respect to that nomination are not helpful and not \nrespectful of the damage done to the Hispanic community by insisting on \nso divisive a nominee.\n  I invite the President to work with us and to nominate more \nmainstream individuals like Judge Prado. His proven record and \nbipartisan support makes it easier for us to uphold our constitutional \nduty of advise and consent. I encourage those on the other side of the \naisle to allow us to consider his nomination. I look forward to casting \na vote in favor of his confirmation.\n  Judge Prado is an exceptional candidate for elevation to the appeals \ncourt. He has significant experience as a public servant in west Texas. \nPerhaps the fact that he has bipartisan support is the reason why he is \nnot being brought forward at this time for a floor vote. That does not \nfit the Republican message but reveals the truth: That Democratic \nSenators, having already acted on 120 judges nominated by President \nBush, are prepared to support even more of his nominations when they \nare mainstream, consensus nominees. Perhaps the fact that Democrats \nunanimously supported his nomination in committee is seen as a drawback \nfor Mr. Prado in the Republican world of nomination politics. I hope \nthat is not the case.\n  I also hope the fact that Judge Prado is Hispanic has not been a \nfactor in the Republican delay. Some have suggested that Judge Prado \nhas been delayed because Democratic Senators are likely to vote for him \nand thereby undercut the Republican's shameless charge that the \nopposition to Miguel Estrada is based on his ethnicity. Republican \npartisans have made lots of partisan hay attacking Democrats in \nconnection with the Estrada nomination. We all know that the White \nHouse could have cooperated with the Senate by producing his work \npapers and the Senate could have proceeded to a vote on the Estrada \nnomination months ago. The request for his work papers was sent last \nMay.\n  Rather than respond as every other administration has over the last \n20 years and provide access to those papers, this White House has \nstonewalled. Rather than follow the policy of openness outlined by \nAttorney General Robert Jackson in the 1940's, this administration has \nstonewalled. And Republican Senators and other partisans could not wait \nto claim that the impasse created by the White House's change in policy \nand practice with respect to nominations was somehow attributable to \nDemocrats being anti-Hispanic. The charge would be laughable if it were \nnot so calculated to do political damage and to divide the Hispanic \ncommunity. That is what Republican partisans hope is the result. That \nis wrong.\n  So some have come to the conclusion that Republican delay in \nconnection with the consideration of Judge Prado's nomination may be \nrelated to the political strategy of the White House to characterize \nDemocrats unfairly. Might the record be set straight if Democrats were \nseen to be supporting this Hispanic nominee to the Fifth Circuit? Might \nthe Republicans' own record of opposing President Clinton's nominations \nof Judge Jorge Rangel and Enrique Moreno to that same circuit court be \ncontrasted unfavorably with Democrats' support of Judge Prado?\n  Might Judge Prado, a conservative from Texas with a public record of \nservice as a Federal district court judge, become the first Hispanic \nappointed by President Bush to the circuit courts with widespread \nsupport from Senate Democrats? Might this more mainstream, consensus \nnominee stand in stark contrast to the ideological choices intended to \npack the courts on which the White House and Senate Republicans \nconcentrate almost exclusively?\n  Judge Prado has 19 years of experience as a U.S. District Court \njudge, which provides us with a significant judicial career to \nevaluate. A review of Judge Prado's actions on the bench demonstrates a \nsolid record of fairness and evenhandedness.\n  While I may not agree with each and every one of his rulings or with \nevery action he has taken as a lawyer or judge, my review of his record \nleads me to conclude that he will be a fair judge. No supervisor or \ncolleague of Judge Prado's has questioned his ability or willingness to \ninterpret the law fairly. Judge Prado enjoys the full support of the \nCongressional Hispanic Caucus and the Mexican American Legal Defense \nand Education Fund. Not a single person or organization has submitted a \nletter of opposition or raised concerns about Judge Prado. No \ncontroversy. No red flags. No basis for concern. No opposition. This \nexplains why his nomination was voted out of the Judiciary Committee \nwith a unanimous, bipartisan vote on an expedited basis.\n  To understand the importance of Judge Prado's nomination, we must put \nit in the context of prior nominations to the Fifth Circuit Court of \nAppeals. Until Judge Prado's hearing, it had been more than a decade \nsince a Latino nominee to that Court had even been allowed a hearing by \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee, let alone a vote on the floor. I recall \nPresident Clinton's two Hispanic nominations to the Fifth Circuit and \nthe poor treatment they received from the Republican-led Senate.\n  Judge Jorge Rangel was a former Texas State judge and a dedicated \nattorney in private practice in Corpus Christi, TX when President \nClinton nominated him to the United States Court of Appeals for the \nFifth Circuit in 1997. Judge Rangel is a graduate of the University of \nHouston and the Harvard Law School and earned a rating of ``Well \nQualified'' by the American Bar Association. Yet, under Republican \nleadership, he never received a hearing on his nomination, let alone a \nvote by the Committee or by the full Senate. His nomination languished \nwithout action for 15 months. Despite his treatment, this outstanding \ngentleman has recently written us in support of a judicial nominee of \nPresident Bush.\n  After Judge Rangel, disappointed with his treatment at the hands of \nthe Republican majority, asked the President not to resubmit his \nnomination, President Clinton nominated Enrique Moreno, a distinguished \nattorney in private practice in El Paso, TX. Mr. Moreno is a graduate \nof Harvard University and the Harvard Law School. He was given the \nhighest rating of unanimously ``Well Qualified'' by the ABA. Mr. Moreno \nalso waited 15 months, but was never allowed a hearing before the \nSenate Judiciary Committee. President Clinton renominated him at the \nbeginning of 2001, but President Bush, squandering an opportunity for \nbipartisanship, withdrew the nomination and refused to renominate him.\n  In addition, President Clinton nominated H. Alston Johnson to the \nFifth Circuit in 1999. This talented Louisianan came to the Senate with \nthe support of both of his home state Senators but he never received a \nhearing on his nomination or a vote by the Committee or the full Senate \nin 1999, 2000, or the beginning of 2001. His nomination languished \nwithout action for 23 months.\n  In contrast, when I served as Chair of the Judiciary Committee last \nCongress, we granted Edith Clement a hearing within months of her \nnomination. At that time there had been no hearings on Fifth Circuit \nnominees since 1994 and no confirmations since 1995.\n  We also proceeded to hearings, committee debate and committee votes \non the divisive and controversial nominations of Judge Priscilla Owen \nand Judge Charles Pickering. We granted hearings and votes on all four \nof this President's nominees to the Fifth Circuit in spite of the \ntreatment Republicans accorded President Clinton's qualified nominees \nto that same circuit. Under Republican leadership, none of President \nClinton's nominees to this Court received a hearing during his entire \nsecond term of office.\n  Some of my friends on the other side of the aisle have made the \noutrageous claim that Democratic Senators are anti-Hispanic or anti-\nLatino. I think it is important to set the record straight.\n  Of the ten Latino appellate judges currently seated in the Federal \ncourts, 8 were appointed by President Clinton. Three other Latino \nnominees of President Clinton to the appellate courts were blocked by \nRepublicans--as well as several others for the district court. In fact, \nin contrast to the President's selection of only one Latino circuit\n\n[[Page S5638]]\n\ncourt nominee in his first 2 years in office, 3 of President Clinton's \nfirst 14 judicial nominees were Latino, and he nominated more than 30 \nLatino nominees to the Federal courts.\n  During President Clinton's tenure, 10 of his more than 30 Latino \nnominees, including Judge Rangel, Enrique Moreno, and Christine \nArguello to the circuit courts, were delayed or blocked from receiving \nhearings or votes by the Republican leadership.\n  Republicans delayed consideration of Judge Richard Paez for over \n1,500 days, and 39 Republicans voted against him. The confirmations of \nLatina circuit nominees Rosemary Barkett and Sonia Sotomayor were also \ndelayed by Republicans. Judge Barkett was targeted for delay and defeat \nby Republicans based on claims about her judicial philosophy, but those \nefforts were not successful. After significant delays, 36 Republicans \nvoted against the confirmation of this nominee who received a ``Well \nQualified'' rating by the ABA. Additionally, Judge Sotomayor, who also \nreceived a ``Well Qualified'' rating and had been appointed to district \ncourt by President George H.W. Bush, was targeted by Republicans for \ndelay or defeat when she was nominated to the Second Circuit. She was \nconfirmed, although 29 Republicans voted against her.\n  The fact is that the Latino nominations that the Senate has received \nfrom this administration have been acted upon in a expeditious manner. \nThey have overwhelmingly enjoyed bipartisan support. Under the \nDemocratically-led Senate, we swiftly granted hearings for and \neventually confirmed Judge Christina Armijo of New Mexico, Judge \nPhillip Martinez and Randy Crane of Texas, Judge Jose Martinez of \nFlorida, U.S. Magistrate Judge Alia Ludlum, and Judge Jose Linares of \nNew Jersey to the district courts.\n  This year, we also confirmed Judge James Otero of California, and we \nwould have held his confirmation hearing last year if his ABA peer \nrating had been delivered to us in time for the scheduling of our last \nhearing. As I have noted, we also have the nomination of Cecilia \nAltonaga to be a Federal judge in Florida already on the Senate \nExecutive Calendar.\n  I, again, urge those on the other side of the aisle to help us fill \nmore judicial vacancies more quickly by bringing those nominations that \nhave bipartisan support to the front of the line for Committee hearings \nand floor votes. As I have noted throughout the last 2 years, the \nSenate is able to move expeditiously when we have consensus, mainstream \nnominees to consider.\n  That is the way to achieve 100 confirmations in 17 months and 120 in \nless than 2 years. The lesson that less controversial nominees are \nconsidered and confirmed more easily was the lesson of the last 2 years \nand that lesson has been lost on this White House.\n  Unfortunately, far too many of this President's nominees raise \nserious concerns about whether they will be fair judges to all parties \non all issues. Those types of nominees should not be rushed through the \nprocess. I invite the President to nominate more mainstream individuals \nlike Judge Prado. His proven record and bipartisan support makes it \neasier for us to uphold our constitutional duty of advise and consent. \nI encourage those on the other side of the aisle to allow us to \nconsider his nomination. I look forward to casting a vote in favor of \nhis confirmation.\n  I, again, thank the Senate Republican leadership for working with us \nto proceed to this consensus nomination, to provide adequate time for \ndebate and to proceed to a vote without further delay. Judge Prado's \nnomination has been delayed on the Senate executive calendar for \nseveral weeks, unnecessarily in my view. I recall all too vividly when \nanonymous Republican holds delayed Senate action on the nomination of \nJudge Sonia Sotomayor to the Second Circuit for 7 months. Let us work \ntogether. I thank all Senators, even those Republicans who have \nanonymously held up consideration of Judge Prado's nomination for the \nlast month, for agreeing to proceed with this nomination at this time. \nI congratulate the nominee and his family on his elevation to the Fifth \nCircuit and look forward to his continuing judicial service.\n  Again, I thank the Congressional Hispanic Caucus for its support of \nthis nomination and for working with the Senate to bring this matter \nforward at this time. I do thank the Republican leadership for changing \nits position and working with us to move forward.\n  I see the distinguished senior Senator from Texas in the Chamber, and \nif I have further time, I withhold it. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I would like to be notified when I have 1 minute \nremaining so Senator Hatch can take that last minute of our 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be notified.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am pleased, of course, the Senate \nwill be voting on Judge Ed Prado to move to the Fifth Circuit Court of \nAppeals. He has been a judge on the district bench for a number of \nyears--actually, since 1984--and he has an outstanding record. He was a \ngreat choice by the President, and this is a circuit that needs these \nvacancies filled. There is no question it is a judicial emergency. We \nhope to fill this seat with Judge Prado, and then we hope Justice \nPriscilla Owen will also fill the other vacancy for the Fifth Circuit, \nthat is open, from Texas.\n  Judge Prado has an outstanding record. He graduated from the \nUniversity of Texas and the University of Texas Law School, a great \nuniversity in our Nation. He also has served as U.S. Attorney for the \nWestern District. He served as judge on the State district court. This \nis a man who has made public service his career, and an outstanding one \nat that. He is so well regarded in San Antonio and by the people who \nhave gone before him. They know they will get fair and impartial \njustice in his court. That is why I am pleased to support his \nnomination.\n  This nomination has moved very quickly. We are very pleased because \nof the vacancies on the Fifth Circuit. But the ABA agreed that he had \nthe ``well qualified'' unanimous approval of their committee.\n  There is just no controversy at all with this wonderful judge. It is \nmy pleasure as a Texan to support and urge my colleagues to support the \nnomination of Judge Ed Prado.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute remains.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask for an additional 2 minutes equally \ndivided in addition to the 1 minute I have remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased that my Democratic colleagues \nare willing to join us in confirming Judge Prado to the Fifth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals.\n  I regret that there has been any discussion that somehow the \nRepublican leadership has held up this nominee. That is not true. What \nis particularly troubling is the suggestion that there is some \nRepublican delay in the consideration of Judge Prado's nomination \nrelated to the Estrada nomination.\n  I would point out that Democrats who support the nomination of Judge \nPrado to the Fifth Circuit are leading the opposition to Mr. Estrada, \nnominated to the D.C. Circuit. Those Democrats have characterized the \nD.C. Circuit as ``the second most important court in the land.'' \nSenator Kennedy stated recently that the D.C. Circuit makes decisions \nwith national impact on the lives of all of the American people. \nSenator Schumer echoed these sentiments just yesterday. It does seem to \nme that there is a different standard being applied to Miguel Estrada--\na nominee to the second highest court in the land--than to Judge \nPrado--a nominee to one of twelve other Circuit Courts--although they \nare important.\n  In any event, neither the confirmation of Judge Prado nor the \nconfirmation of any judge justifies or excuses the continued \nobstruction on Miguel Estrada. I repeat that the arguments put forth by \nopponents of Mr. Estrada just do not hold up under scrutiny. Their \nrepeated accusations that he failed to answer the questions has been \nrefuted again and again. The demand for confidential memoranda he \nauthored as a line attorney for the Department of Justice is both \nextraordinary and ill-advised, as I and others, including all the \nliving former Solicitors General, have repeatedly demonstrated.\n\n[[Page S5639]]\n\n  So my Democratic colleagues have had unlimited opportunities to make \ntheir case on Mr. Estrada. Some of them oppose him; others support him. \nBut one thing has remained clear through this debate: There is no good \nreason to deny Mr. Estrada an up or down vote on his nomination.\n  The time has come to end the debate on Mr. Estrada's nomination and \ngive him and up or down vote, as the Senate will now do on Judge Prado. \nIt is the fair thing to do.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to join me in voting for Judge Prado's \nnomination at this time.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I am glad my friends on the Republican side now allow \nJudge Prado's nomination to go forward. I intend to vote for him.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Edward C. Prado, of Texas, to be United \nStates Circuit Judge for the Fifth Circuit?\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I announce that the Senator from Oklahoma (Mr. Inhofe) \nis necessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. \nLieberman) and the Senator from Maryland (Mr. Sarbanes) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, tomorrow marks a special milestone in the \nhistory of the Capitol: The 175th anniversary of the U.S. Capitol \nPolice Department.\n  Those of us who are privileged to work in the Capitol know, perhaps \nbetter than anyone, what a difficult and demanding job it is to protect \nthe Capitol, and how extraordinarily well the men and women of the \nCapitol Police perform that job.\n  We also know how dedicated they are to their duty.\n  After September 11 and the anthrax attack on the Capitol itself, no \none showed more courage, no one was showed more determination, and no \none was more critical to ensuring that the ``People's House'' remained \nopen to the people, than the members of the Capitol Police force.\n  We, and all Americans, owe them an enormous debt of gratitude.\n  Today, on the eve of the 175th anniversary of the department, we say \n``thank you'' to Chief Gainer and all of the men and women of the \nCapitol Police.\n  When we look at the highly trained, highly skilled professionals who \nprotect the Capitol today, it is hard to imagine sometimes that the \ndepartment is descended from such humble beginnings.\n  The Capitol Police department traces its origins to 1801, when \nCongress moved from Philadelphia to Washington. At the time, the \ndepartment had exactly one member, a watchman named John Goldin, who \nwas not armed, had no power of arrest, and was paid an annual salary of \n$371.75.\n  In 1827, the force was expanded for the first time, to four watchmen; \ntwo to work the day shift, one to work the night shift, and one to fill \nin as needed.\n  One-hundred and seventy-five years ago tomorrow, on May 2, 1828, \nCongress passed a milestone piece of legislation titled, appropriately, \n``the Act of May 2, 1828,'' bringing responsibility for policing the \nCapitol, for the first time, under the direction of the presiding \nofficers of the House and Senate.\n  This same law also empowered the Capitol watchmen with full law \nenforcement authority. It transformed a corps of watchmen into a police \ndepartment.\n  In 1854, the Capitol Police were armed for the first time with heavy \nhickory canes.\n  In 1867, responsibility of the Capitol Police was transferred to the \nSergeant of Arms in the House and Senate, where it remains today.\n  In 1873, the U.S. Capitol Police Board was formed to oversee the \ndepartment.\n  At the beginning of the 20th century, the department had grown to 67 \nmembers.\n  In 1909, the department expanded to just over 100 members; a move \nnecessitated by the construction of the Russell Senate Office Building \nand the Cannon House Office building. This also marked the first time \nthe authority of the Capitol Police stretched outside the Capitol \nbuilding itself.\n  In 1935, the Capitol Police Board, for the first time, set \nqualification standards for Capitol Police officers.\n  In 1974, the first women officers joined the force.\n  In 1981, the Capitol Police were authorized to protect Members and \nofficers of Congress, and their families, anywhere in the United \nStates.\n  Since September 11, all Members of the House and Senate leadership \nhave been required to have Capitol police protection whenever we \ntravel, and throughout the day as we go outside the Capitol building. \nOne happy result of that, for me, is that I have been able to show off \nmy home State to a number of officers.\n  And I am proud to say that a few of them now consider themselves \nalmost honorary South Dakotans.\n  From the beginning, protecting the Capitol has always carried the \nrisk of personal injury, or worse.\n  On 1814, during the War of 1812, the British set fire to the Capitol \nbuilding.\n  During the Civil War, the Capitol Police kept the ``People's House'' \nopen to the public from sunrise to sunset, despite the fact that \nmilitary troops were stationed around, and at times even in this \nbuilding.\n  Three times in the last century--in 1915, 1917, and 1983--bombs were \nexploded in the Capitol by groups seeking to advance political agendas.\n\n[[Page S5640]]\n\n  In 1954, four members of a Puerto Rican nationalist group entered the \nHouse gallery and fired more than 16 shots with .38 caliber pistols at \nthe 243 Members who were then on the floor. Five Congress Members were \ninjured.\n  In response to each of these attacks, the Capitol Police Department \nstrengthened its training procedures, and strengthened its ability to \nprevent and respond to such attacks.\n  The fact that schoolchildren and other visitors can sit in the \ngalleries today and watch their Government in action is a powerful \nsymbol of America's commitment to democracy, and a testimony to the \nskill and courage of the Capitol Police.\n  Given the risks, it seems almost miraculous that the department did \nnot lose a single member in the line of duty until 1984, when Sergeant \nChristopher Eney was killed in a training exercise.\n  And we all remember the terrible Friday afternoon, July 24, 1998, \nwhen Officer JJ Chestnut and Detective John Gibson were killed \npreventing a severely mentally ill man with a gun from entering the \nCapitol and killing others. We still honor and miss them today.\n  Their deaths brought into sharp relief how difficult it is to protect \n``the People's House'' and keep it open to the people at the same time. \nIt is a complex balancing act that few other police departments in the \nworld even attempt, and none performs better.\n  On September 11 and during the anthrax attacks, the Capitol Police \nreacted with great courage and professionalism under circumstances few \npeople could have imagined even a few years ago.\n  Since then, the department has undergone an intensive process to be \nable to prevent, and respond to, the new threats posed by global \nterrorism.\n  Capitol Police officers continue to work long days and long weeks in \norder to respond to the need for increased vigilance. It is not unusual \nto see an officer guarding a door to the Capitol when we arrive in the \nmorning--and see that same officer, still on duty, when we leave at \nnight.\n  Without them, we could not do our jobs. And this Capitol could not \nkeep its doors open to the more than 1 million people who visit it each \nyear from across this Nation and the world.\n  Over the years, many fine men and women have served on the Capitol \nPolice Force--including my dear friend, the assistant minority leader, \nHarry Reid.\n  As they prepare to celebrate 175 years of proud service to our \nNation, we thank them all for their devotion to duty, their great skill \nand professionalism, and for their unyielding courage and sacrifice.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith).

Mr. President, I rise to speak about the \ndepleted condition of our national economy and what we ought to do.\n  It is timely to point out that next week this Chamber, the U.S. \nSenate, will consider legislation raising the debt limit; that is, the \nlimit set by law under which the Federal Government can borrow money \nthat is a debt obligation of the United States. That debt limit is \napproximately $6.3 trillion. Next week, we will consider the House bill \nwhich has been sent to us to raise that by the largest amount ever in \nthe history of the Union, almost $1 trillion. Specifically, $984 \nbillion will be the vote that we will cast next week to raise the debt \nlimit.\n  The Federal Government has to pay its obligations. So by law we have \nto raise the debt limit so that the Federal Government can pay its \nobligations. But it is illustrative of the fact that the national debt \nis growing larger and larger, and we are adopting fiscal policies that \nadd to that national debt each year by increasing the deficit financing \nthat we engage in by the budgets we adopt and then all of the \nlegislation with which we implement those budgets--the tax cuts, the \nspending bills, financing the war, all of those necessary expenditures. \nBut a fiscal policy has been advocated by the White House, one of \ndropping off over the next 10 years tax revenues by some $720 billion. \nAnd what is likely to pass the Senate is the commitments that were made \nseveral weeks ago that that level will be in the range of $350 billion \nover 10 years instead of the level passed by or to be passed by the \nHouse of Representatives in the range of about $550 billion over 10 \nyears.\n  Is any elected official not for tax cuts? Of course, we are. But that \nis not the decision with which we are confronted. What we are \nconfronted with is, what do we do to better stabilize a sick economy \nand to get our economy moving again? Almost unanimously, the \neconomists--I say almost unanimously because it is probably a ratio of \n9 to 1 among the economists, including statements issued yesterday by \nthe Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan--are basically \nsaying: Watch out. If you deficit finance, long-term interest rates are \ngoing to go up. It is going to depress the economy coming out of this \nnear recession. It is going to be difficult for us to get the economy \nmoving again.\n  That is particularly true of the financial condition in which we find \nourselves now. In the first 6 months of this fiscal year, the \nGovernment has had to go out and deficit spend to the tune of $250 \nbillion. Annualized, that means we will deficit finance, if that trend \nholds up, a half a trillion dollars.\n  What does deficit financing mean? That means we are going to adopt \nbudgetary policies of spending and tax revenues by which we are going \nto spend a half a trillion dollars, $500 billion, more than we have \ncoming in in tax revenue. And you wonder why the stock market is \nlanguishing so much. The stock market is a reflection of the American \npeople's confidence in the future of the economy and economic activity. \nSo is it any wonder the stock market just keeps kind of languishing \nalong? Do people have the confidence we are going to come out of these \neconomic doldrums and get the economy moving again? I think you see how \nthey are voting with their pocketbooks on the stock market. The people \ndo not have that confidence. Why should they if, in this year, we are \ngoing to spend a half trillion dollars more than we have coming in in \ntax revenue?\n\n  This leads me, then, to next week. Next week, in addition to taking \nup the debt ceiling bill of raising the debt almost a trillion dollars \nmore so we can pay our bills, we are also going to take up the tax \nbill. The tax bill, as presented to this body, is at least going to be \n$350 billion. There are many in this body who would like that tax bill \nto be even more over a 10-year period.\n  To me, it is not wise fiscal policy if that causes our deficit \nfinancing to go up continually, just like we are seeing in this present \nfiscal year. If that debt keeps getting added to the national debt, \nthen it won't be too long--another couple years--and we will be right \nback here asking to raise the debt limit from about $7.3 trillion--\nanother trillion dollars--up to about $8.5 trillion. That is not sound \nfiscal policy.\n  That is not going to bring us back on the road to economic recovery. \nWhat we can do is balance interests. We can have some tax cuts that \nwill get the economy moving again, that will provide economic growth, \nthat will provide jobs so we get more dollars into the economy and \ncirculating to offset the sickly economy, offset the lack of economic \nactivity, some of which has been brought on by September 11 but some of \nwhich has also been brought on by an economic policy that is embracing \ndeficit financing.\n  I will never forget over two decades ago when I was in the House of \nRepresentatives. One of the most prolific writers and great speakers \nwho had articulated balanced budgets suddenly changed his tune and \nstarted speaking the message that we will not worship at the shrine of \nbalanced budgets anymore. Well, in the early 1980s, that kind of \nworship didn't work. The fiscal policies adopted in the early 1980s \nwere so out of whack with the deficits annually soaring up to as high \nas $250 billion in 1 year, finally those policies had to be reversed--\nnot once but three times.\n  Now we have a situation that is double the annual deficits ever \nexperienced\n\n[[Page S5641]]\n\nin the 1980s. We best get about the process of getting our economic and \nfiscal house in order if we want America to have the economic \nprosperity our citizens should enjoy.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu).

Mr. President, a number of us had the honor of attending \nan event at the White House on Tuesday in which President Bush urged \nCongress to act quickly in passing an emergency plan for global HIV/\nAIDS relief.\n  I come to the Senate floor this afternoon to applaud the President \nfor his remarks and for his continuing commitment to ease the worldwide \nsuffering caused by the HIV/AIDS epidemic around the world.\n  I also want to thank Secretary of State Colin Powell and also my \ncolleagues in both the House of Representatives and in the Senate for \ntheir leadership in fighting this dread disease. There are so many \npeople to thank. Let me commend Senators Lugar, Biden, Frist, Santorum, \nDurbin, and Kerry for their tireless efforts and their dedication to \nthis fight, as well as Congressmen Henry Hyde and Tom Lantos for their \ngreat leadership and their great vision. I am encouraged by what they \nhave done with their leadership.\n  I believe we will soon pass a comprehensive global AIDS relief \ninitiative. As the President said, time is not on our side. It is \nimperative that we in the U.S. Congress move quickly. As President Bush \nso correctly said on Tuesday:\n\n       Fighting AIDS on a global scale is a massive and \n     complicated undertaking. Yet, this cause is rooted in the \n     simplest of moral duties. When we see this kind of \n     preventable suffering--when we see a plague leaving graves \n     and orphans across a continent--we must act.\n\n  The President of the United States is absolutely right. This is a \nmoral issue. We as a nation and as a people have an obligation to act. \nWe as a nation and we as a people have the ability to fight this \ndisease. We have the tools. And it is our duty and it is our obligation \nto help ease this grave and global public health crisis.\n  In February, I made my 12th trip to Haiti and my first visit to \nGuyana, both nations in our hemisphere that President Bush has cited as \ncountries in dire need of our assistance to fight this HIV/AIDS \nproblem. We traveled there to learn more about the AIDS situation and \ndetermine what kind of health infrastructure is in place to fight the \ndisease. What we saw in these visits was devastating, with so many \nchildren and adults dying of this horrible disease and too few drugs to \ngo around to help treat them and keep them alive.\n  Without question, HIV/AIDS is a human tragedy of grave proportions--\nnot just in Africa but right here in our own backyard in our own \nhemisphere.\n  When you travel to the AIDS-infested regions of the world, as my wife \nFran and I have, and as so many of my colleagues here in the Senate \nhave, such as Majority Leader Frist, Senator Inhofe, Senator Durbin, \nSenator Nelson of Florida, and Senator Chafee, when you see the \nchildren with AIDS, when you hold them, when you touch them, when you \ntalk to the people who care for them, when you know that these children \nwill in all likelihood die, it truly does change you forever. Then when \nyou leave those countries, and when you leave those children, you know \nyou cannot just leave; you know you have to try to do something to \nhelp.\n\n  Our trip in February reinforced what we already knew about the \ndevastation of the disease in Haiti, and allowed us to see what efforts \nare now underway in Guyana.\n  This afternoon, I would like to take a few minutes to tell my \ncolleagues about what we learned on that visit.\n  I was pleased that Senator Chafee and his wife Stephanie were able to \njoin Fran and me on that trip. We learned a great deal about what is \nand what is not being done in both of these impoverished nations.\n  We were fortunate to have Senator Durbin and Senator Nelson of \nFlorida and his wife Grace and Congressman Kendrick Meek join us on an \nearlier trip to Haiti in January, where we saw the tragic effects of \nthe abject poverty and disease that engulfs Haiti today.\n  While there is certainly some miraculous work being done in Haiti to \nease the suffering--work done by people such as Father Tom Hagan and \nhis organization Hands Together--there remains so much work to be done.\n  When you view the HIV/AIDS rates in Haiti and Guyana in the context \nof the disease's overall prevalence rate in our hemisphere--Haiti has \nthe highest rate and Guyana, either the second or third highest rate--\nthe moral imperative of helping these two troubled nations becomes \nabsolutely crystal clear.\n  In Haiti today, a nation of approximately 8 million people, 300,000 \ncurrently live with AIDS--300,000 people out of a country of 8 million \npeople.\n  Guyana follows close behind. In Guyana, a nation of roughly 800,000 \npeople, 35,000--35,000--have been identified as HIV positive or as \nhaving AIDS. Of those 35,000 people who have been identified as HIV \npositive or as having AIDS, only 200--less than 1 percent--are getting \nantiretroviral drug treatment. Of those 200, only one--only one--is a \nchild. So virtually none of the children in Guyana are getting any kind \nof drug treatment at all--virtually none. Only one child in all of \nGuyana is getting any drug treatment for AIDS. What a great tragedy.\n  Consequently, the disease is having a devastating impact on these \nnations, and especially on the children.\n  In Haiti, there are more than 150,000 orphans due to AIDS. This \nnumber has been increasing for over a decade and is expected to rise \neven more. Specifically, the percentage of Haitian AIDS orphans has \ngone from 7 percent in 1990 to 43 percent in 2001 and is estimated to \nincrease to 49 percent by 2010. That will be a sevenfold increase in 20 \nyears.\n  Rates are equally troubling in Guyana. In 1990, there were no \nchildren orphaned due to AIDS, none, but by 2001, 21 percent of the \norphans were the result of AIDS, and that number is projected to double \nto 41 percent by 2010.\n  Not only is AIDS orphaning these children, but many of them are also \nsuffering from the disease.\n  Today, in Haiti, there are hundreds of orphanages spread throughout \nthe country, hundreds actually just in the capital of Port-au-Prince, \nbut there are less than just a handful that are serving or even taking \ncare of children who have AIDS or who are HIV positive.\n  We visited one of these orphanages in February, one of the orphanages \nthat is taking care of children with AIDS. It is a wonderful place. It \nis a place called Arc en Ciel or ``Rainbow House Orphanage.'' This is a \nplace that is doing just wonderful work.\n\n  A Canadian couple--Danielle and Robert Penette--came in and restored \nthe home there, and today it is a wonderful, bright, cheery, clean, and \nbeautifully maintained orphanage for about 37 Haitian children. I think \nabout 30 of them actually are HIV positive or already have AIDS.\n  What we saw there was truly inspiring: children playing, laughing, \nand learning in the classroom. They sang songs for us. They were happy \nand healthy and content. They did not seem like orphans at all really \nbut more like one big happy family--one healthy family. It was hard to \nimagine that any of these little children were sick at all.\n  But of the HIV-positive children at the Rainbow House Orphanage, \nabout 15 of them are currently in need of antiretroviral drugs. Those \n15 children, fortunately, are now receiving these drugs.\n  One of the important lessons we learned about these children and \nabout the Rainbow House is that by providing these drugs, and by \nproviding love and consistent nutrition--this good health care--clean \nwater, the Penettes, this wonderful couple, are making an unbelievable \nimpact on the quality of life for these very sick children.\n  What they, in effect, are doing is prolonging the time it takes \nbefore these children actually need to be on AIDS treatment drugs. So \nhalf the children are not even on the drugs yet. Half of them are on \nthe drugs.\n\n[[Page S5642]]\n\n  There are other places in Haiti, places where there are good, decent, \nloving people, such as the Penettes, who are also working miracles.\n  For example, at another orphanage we visited in January, we saw \nwonderful people doing the best they could to care for some very sick, \nvery malnourished children. At this particular orphanage, many children \nare brought there who are on the verge of death. The parents bring them \nthere to try to save them.\n  The good people who run these orphanages--saints really--love these \nchildren. They care for them. They feed them, give them what little \nmedicine they have access to. These people bring many of these dying \nchildren back to life. They save them and they nourish them.\n  But, tragically, for many of these children, they have AIDS. \nUnfortunately, the people who care for them in these orphanages--these \nother orphanages--do not have access to what the Penettes have; that \nis, the lifesaving drugs, antiretroviral drugs to keep these children \nwith AIDS alive.\n  They can give them love. They can give them food and clean water--and \nthat helps--but they cannot give them the drugs that ultimately will \nsave them.\n  At this orphanage that Fran and I saw, they have an entire floor just \nfor children--these young babies with AIDS. What you see when you go \nthere really does change you forever. It is truly tragic--row after row \nof steel cribs with babies at various stages of disease, none of whom \nare receiving any sort of antiretroviral drug treatment.\n  I remember seeing a little boy. He was about 4 or 5 years old, a \nlittle boy whose name was Francois. He had AIDS. The day we were there, \nwhen we saw him, he was very close to death. He was laid out on a \nmakeshift bed on the cold, concrete floor. He had an IV attached to \nhim, and he was getting some fluids.\n  The wonderful people who were caring for him explained that he was no \nlonger able to keep any food down. They explained to us that he would \nprobably die within a couple days.\n  There were no drugs available to treat him. So the people who were \ncaring for him, were loving him, nurturing him, were doing what they \ncould to give him the love they could and to make him as comfortable in \nthe little time this poor little boy had remaining. I will not ever \nforget that little boy. I will not forget him for the rest of my life. \nI don't think anybody else who was in our group and who saw that little \nboy will forget him either.\n  Another little boy I won't forget was about 7 years old. He also had \nAIDS. But he appeared to be, when you looked at him, very healthy. He \nwas lively and content and thriving. But when we talked to the people \nin the orphanage, sadly we found out that will not last because this \nlittle boy also has AIDS. Very likely, unless something changes, unless \ndrugs are made available to him, this little 7-year-old boy, who I also \ncan't get out of my mind, will also eventually die.\n  His death will be a needless one because these drugs are available. \nIt is just that the folks caring for this little boy do not have access \nto them. Money is not available. The drugs are not available. That is \nan injustice. It is wrong. It is a human tragedy.\n  When we see children who are healthy now and who could remain healthy \nif treated properly, we feel so helpless because we know they are \neventually going to die if we don't do something. That is why we must \ntry to do something. I believe we must take action to save these \nchildren.\n  This is one of the children my wife Fran and I had the opportunity to \nsee at the orphanage I just described in Haiti. This is one of the \nlittle children who does in fact have AIDS. This is one of the little \nchildren who does not have access today to the drugs that will save \nthis child. So when the President talks about a moral imperative, as he \nso eloquently does, and says we in the United States have a moral \nobligation to stop the suffering, to reach out and help these children, \nthese are not just statistics. These are children who are in Africa, \nAsia, Haiti, Guyana. This is just one of the real faces of the \nchildren.\n  This is a picture of one of the many AIDS babies we saw and actually \nheld when we were in Haiti. When you look at that innocent, helpless \nlittle child, a child who has acquired AIDS through no fault of her \nown, you realize we as a Nation have a moral obligation to help. \nChildren like this little girl, who in all likelihood may have already \ndied in the time that has passed since we were in Haiti, will continue \nto die because they are not getting the drugs they need. These drugs \nare available, but they are not getting them.\n  It is clear we are not doing enough. It is also clear this Congress \nmust act. We cannot just walk away from nations such as Haiti and \nGuyana and these children and say this problem is too big for us to \nfix. We cannot walk away and say these are resource-strapped Third \nWorld countries and there is nothing we can do. We cannot walk away and \nsay we should not funnel more resources into those nations because it \nwill be too difficult to get compliance with the reforms; in other \nwords, that lack of education and a weak and feeble infrastructure will \nimpede any progress. We cannot walk away and simply say these are poor \npeople, illiterate people, and we cannot teach them how to take the \ndrugs. We cannot walk away and say there is no hope, because the \nevidence is that is not true. There is hope.\n  The evidence is good doctors have already demonstrated, in countries \nlike Haiti, that no matter how poor, how illiterate, people can take \nthe drugs. They can do it very well and effectively, and their lives \ncan be saved. In fact, doctors in Haiti have already demonstrated--Dr. \nPape, Dr. Farmer, who I will talk about in a moment--through the \ncompliance rate, in other words, the rate people taking these drugs and \ndoing it consistently and saving their own lives, that they can do it \njust as well as you or I can do it in the United States or someone who \nhas AIDS in the United States can do it.\n\n  The fact is, despite the enormity of the despair, there is an equal \nif not greater amount of hope. There is hope because we can help. There \nis hope because a great deal is being done already. In Guyana, there is \nan energetic President, President Jagdeo, and a dedicated health \nminister who are committed to fighting this disease and building a \nhealth infrastructure in their nation that will in fact save lives. \nThey have a long way to go, but I am encouraged by their current \neducation efforts and by their commitment to getting more drug \ntreatment into their nation. As they work to build this infrastructure, \nthey can learn a great deal from the success stories in Haiti. I will \ntell you a couple.\n  First there is Dr. Bill Pape who was with us at the White House just \n2 days ago and who the President talked about and cited as a great \nexample. He is director of GESHKIO, a health organization with 27 \nclinics in the Port-au-Prince area dedicated to the prevention and \ntreatment of AIDS. I met with Dr. Pape several times in the past. I am \nalways amazed at what this man has accomplished. Through his work, Dr. \nPape is showing that in places as poor as Haiti, a nation with an \naverage yearly per capita income of only $250, a nation where there are \nvery limited health resources and, frankly, a nation with all kinds of \nproblems with the government, HIV treatment and prevention can and does \nwork.\n  At the 27 GESHKIO clinics, they see over 11,000 children, of whom 589 \nare HIV positive. Sadly, of those children, only 29 are currently on \nantiretroviral drugs, but that is changing. At the same time, GESHKIO \nis working hard to treat infected mothers to help prevent mother-to-\nchild HIV transmission.\n  At Dr. Pape's clinics, they have found 30 percent of children were \nbeing born with HIV/AIDS if the mother was HIV positive and not \nreceiving treatment. But of the HIV-positive mothers receiving \ntreatment, only 8.7 percent of the children born are HIV positive. \nClearly, this shows what can be accomplished, and this is one of the \nPresident's major initiatives--the mother-to-child transmission. It \nshows what you can do when you can go from a 30 percent AIDS incidence \nto at least 8.7, and possibly even lower. Think of all the children \nwhose lives are being saved, who are not getting HIV, who are not HIV \npositive because of that.\n  Mr. President, the medical science is clear: If we can reach these \nmothers\n\n[[Page S5643]]\n\nearly enough before they give birth to that child who will have AIDS \nbecause the mom has AIDS, and if we can get medical treatment to the \nmother and get her the proper drugs, we can save that child. We can \nsave that child at comparatively little economic cost. We should think \nof the savings not just in dollars and cents, but in lives saved.\n  I was pleased to have the opportunity in February to also meet with \nDr. Paul Farmer, who is fighting AIDS in the rural and remote parts of \nHaiti. He runs an organization called ``Partners in Health'' and \noperates clinics in Cange. Dr. Farmer is making tremendous progress. \nSince 1999, his organization has tracked a population of 3,500 HIV/AIDS \npatients and has been able to treat more than 350 of them with \nantiretroviral drugs. Of those receiving drugs since 1999, zero \npercent--no one--has died. Yet, tragically, of those not receiving drug \ntreatment, 35 percent, so far, have died.\n  Both Dr. Pape and Dr. Farmer have received grants from the Global \nAIDS Fund to supplement their efforts. And I point out that money is \nbeing put into proven organizations that can get the job done. This \ntells us we are willing to invest efforts that are working and making a \ndifference and saving lives. While Dr. Farmer and Dr. Pape have \nempirically proven there is success in treatment in a Third World \nnation, and there is hope, we still must do more. We must act, and we \nmust act now.\n  I am encouraged we have moved forward in terms of our AIDS spending \nlevel--a level that has gone up significantly over the last few years. \nI compliment my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee, and \nparticularly Senator Ted Stevens for his efforts and dedication to \nincreasing our funds to fight AIDS.\n  Earlier this year, Senator Durbin and I were successful in amending \nthe fiscal year 2003 omnibus appropriations bill to include an \nadditional $100 million to fight the global AIDS pandemic. That money \nwill go a long way. If that money is used to implement a holistic \napproach to fighting AIDS, I believe we can make significant advances \nworldwide. That means focusing funds on education and prevention and \ntreatment--treatment in terms of mother-to-child transmission, \ntreatment of mothers who already have children, and treatment of all \ninfected adults. This type of comprehensive approach can and will make \na difference.\n  Let me turn my colleagues' attention to two other photographs from \nour recent trip to Guyana. You will see two men who are stricken with \nAIDS. They are patients of the only public hospital in that nation's \ncapital of Georgetown. When you look at these pictures, you can see the \nanguish in these poor men's eyes. You can see their suffering and you \ncan certainly see their heartbreak. This shows you the ward in this \nhospital in Georgetown. This poor gentleman has AIDS. Though the \nstaggering and shocking statistics can be at once overwhelming and \nseemingly unreal, when you hold babies dying from the disease, or when \nyou see the real faces of these men, the people suffering, as in these \nphotographs, it has to move you. It changes you. It certainly makes the \nstatistics real.\n\n  Mr. President, in a guest column recently in the Washington Post, \nprominent AIDS activist Bono quoted something President Harry Truman \nonce said. This is what Truman said:\n\n       I trust the people because when they know the facts, they \n     do the right thing.\n\n  That certainly is the case, I believe, when it comes to the global \nAIDS problem. We have the opportunity to do the right thing. I believe \nwe will do the right thing.\n  The House plans to take final action on its bill today, and I am \nencouraged by the continued good-faith efforts of my colleagues in the \nSenate. We are moving forward on a bipartisan basis. The majority \nleader, Dr. Bill Frist, has been a real leader in this. My colleague, \nSenator Lugar, on a bipartisan basis, is working with others and moving \nforward on this as well. I am encouraged that we will be able to get a \nbill put together.\n  Mr. President, every 50 seconds a child somewhere in the world dies \nof an AIDS-related illness, and another becomes infected with HIV. We \nhave to do something to stop this. The United States has an obligation \nto lead this fight, and we are leading it and moving forward. I look \nforward to continuing to work with my colleagues as we move ahead. It \nis our duty, it is our moral obligation, and it is the right thing to \ndo.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/01/senate-section/article/S5643-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5643-S5644]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              IMMIGRANT CHILDREN'S HEALTH IMPROVEMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE, Mr. President, I would like to bring a matter to the \nattention of my colleagues. This is a clear example of misplaced \npriorities in the President's budget.\n  Last January, a number of Senators wrote to the President requesting \nthat he include a provision in his budget to allow states to provide \nMedicaid and SCHIP health care coverage for women and children who are \nlegal immigrants.\n  Yesterday, Senator Graham received a letter in response to that \nrequest. The letter makes a number of claims that are, at best, \ndisingenuous.\n  Just to remind my colleagues of the history of this issue: the 1996 \nwelfare law banned legal immigrants from receiving Federal benefits \nunder a number of programs, including Medicaid, for 5 years. The \nargument was made that people shouldn't come to this country if they \nare going to be a public charge.\n  The reality is that many legal immigrants and their families, because \nof language barriers and other issues, agree to take some of the lowest \npaying jobs in this country. They don't come here to take welfare; they \ncome because they want to make better lives for themselves and for \ntheir children. Most of these jobs, as we well know, do not provide \nhealth insurance for citizen families or immigrant families.\n  Legal immigrants play an important role in our overall economy. They \ntake low-paying jobs that businesses rely on. They pay taxes. Immigrant \nchildren are also required to register for the Selective Service when \nthey turn 18. According to the American Immigrant Law Foundation, \n60,000 legal immigrants are on active duty in the U.S. Armed Forces.\n  But now, as a result of this policy, when a woman becomes pregnant, \nor a child gets sick, they have no where to turn but to emergency care, \nwhich is the most expensive means of providing health care.\n  A number of States have realized that this is not an efficient or \nacceptable means of addressing the health care needs of these families. \nSome 20 States now provide health care services to legal immigrants \nusing their own funds. The result of the 1996 policy has not been the \none desired by the authors of the language. Instead, it has resulted in \ntransferring the burden of caring for these people to States and \nhospitals. Unfortunately, the severe fiscal crisis is forcing some \nStates to reexamine their coverage.\n  To respond to this situation, Senator Graham introduced S. 845, the \nImmigrant Children's Health Improvement Act, or ICHIA. It would allow \nStates to use Federal Medicaid and SCHIP funding to provide coverage \nfor pregnant women and children who are legal immigrants. This proposal \nhas strong bipartisan support, not only in the Senate but also in the \nHouse. In fact, last year, it was adopted on a bipartisan basis in the \nFinance Committee during debate on a bill to reauthorize welfare \nprograms.\n  The administration's letter suggests that this proposal would somehow \ncreate a new burden on the States. In fact, the proposal gives States \nthe option to provide this coverage, and allows them to use Federal \nresources to do so, thus giving them significant fiscal relief. No new \nburden would be imposed on the States. In addition, the National \nGovernors Association and the National Conference of State Legislatures \nhave made restoring these benefits a priority.\n  The long-term economic and health consequences of inadequate health \ncare services for pregnant women and children is well-established. The \nadministration's letter tries to minimize the importance of this issue \nfor immigrants, by talking about other, less effective health care \nproposals, such as the Medicaid block grant, and by pointing out that \nthe fetuses of immigrants are covered by SCHIP.\n  It is important to recognize, however, that more than 5 million \nchildren live in poor or ``near-poor'' non-citizen families. That is \nmore than one-quarter of the total population of poor or\n\n[[Page S5644]]\n\n``near-poor'' children. Almost half of all low-income immigrant \nchildren are uninsured--and they are more than twice as likely to be \nuninsured as low-income citizen children with native-born parents.\n  Most of these children will eventually become American citizens. By \ndenying all but emergency health care, and especially by denying \npreventive care, we increase the risk that these children will suffer \nlong-term health consequences--consequences that could reduce their \nability to learn and develop and become productive, contributing \ncitizens; consequences that increase the possibility these children \nwill need more expensive health care later on.\n  The administration claims credit for providing coverage for fetuses, \npresumably because when these children are born they will be citizens. \nBut it is worth noting that the Medicaid/SCHIP ban is having an impact \non citizen children living in immigrant families. As many as 85 percent \nof immigrant families have at least one child who is a citizen. \nAlthough many of these children are eligible for Medicaid and SCHIP, \nreceipt among eligible citizen children of non-citizen parents is \nsignificantly below that for other poor children. Parents may be \nconfused about their children's eligibility, or concerned that somehow \nclaiming these benefits will affect the status of other family members.\n  Finally, the letter suggests that, at a cost of $2.24 billion over 10 \nyears, providing this coverage is too expensive. It also reminds us \nthat this issue must be considered in the context of competing \npriorities. That is precisely my point. Making sure that pregnant \nimmigrant women, and their children, have access to health care, \nincluding preventive care, is an investment in the future workforce of \nthis Nation. Denying them the care they need on an appropriate and \ntimely basis could have dire consequences not only for these \nindividuals, but for our businesses that will depend on a healthy \npopulation for their future workers.\n  I believe providing health care for all of our citizens, including \npregnant women and children who are immigrants, is vital for our future \neconomic strength. It should be a much higher priority than providing a \n$1.2 trillion tax cut for the richest people in the country. It is the \nright thing to do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/01/senate-section/article/S5644-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5644]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. In the last Congress Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Act, a bill that would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence \nof any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred October 21, \n2001, in Anaheim, CA. A 27 year-old Indian physical therapist was \nmistaken for a Middle Easterner and assaulted while celebrating his \nbirthday at a karaoke bar. The victim was leaving the bar at about 1 \na.m. with a group of his friends and family when several men picked a \nfight with him. Witnesses heard at least two people yell racial slurs \nabout ``Middle Easterners.'' The man suffered a shattered jaw and was \nreleased from the hospital 2 days later after undergoing surgery to \nhave his mouth wired shut.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/01/senate-section/article/S5644-2", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5644]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        A RECKLESS GUN INDUSTRY\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, a recent report published by the Brady \nCampaign to Prevent Gun Violence cites numerous examples of reckless \nsales and distribution practices by gun manufacturers, distributors and \ndealers. The report, entitled ``Smoking Guns: Exposing the Gun \nIndustry's Complicity in the Illegal Gun Market,'' reveals a disturbing \npattern of negligence by some in the gun industry.\n  In one example, in 1996, according to the report, the owner and six \nemployees of a California gun store were arrested for numerous Federal \nfirearms offenses. The violations included selling illegally converted, \nfully automatic AK-47 assault rifles and having employees encourage \ncustomers to obtain false identification in order to skirt legal \nrequirements for gun ownership. Even after the owner of the store was \nsent to prison, Heckler & Koch and other gun manufacturers, according \nto the report, continued to supply the store. In a letter explaining \ntheir ongoing business with the gun store, Heckler & Koch wrote that it \n``is not our intention to turn away business.''\n  More recently, the sniper shootings that paralyzed the Washington, \nDC, area last year were committed with a rifle traced to a gun store in \nTacoma, WA. According to the report, the Bushmaster semi-automatic \nassault rifle possessed by the sniper suspects was only one of 238 guns \nmissing from the store's inventory. Despite previous ATF audits which \nrevealed dozens of missing weapons and evidence linking a Bushmaster \nrifle from the store to the sniper killings, according to the report, a \nBushmaster executive announced that his company still considered the \nsame store a ``good customer'' and would continue to sell to it.\n  These examples of gun industry negligence are by no means isolated. \nThe Brady Campaign report contains numerous other examples of careless \nbehavior on the part of gun manufacturers and dealers, many of which \nsurfaced only after civil liability suits were filed. The Brady report \nreveals the disregard of some in the gun industry for even basic self-\nregulation. The Lawful Commerce in Arms Act that recently passed the \nHouse and that has been referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee \nwould shield the gun industry from many legitimate civil lawsuits. \nCertainly, those in the industry who conduct their business negligently \nor recklessly should not be shielded from the civil consequences of \ntheir actions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/01/senate-section/article/S5644-3", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5644-S5645]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       THE BROAD-BASED STOCK OPTION PLAN TRANSPARENCY ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, \nFASB, issued a tentative decision last week to mandate the expensing of \nstock options. As a result of this decision, the FASB will develop a \nmechanism for determining the cost of the options granted to employees \nand then force firms to deduct that cost from earnings in their \nfinancial statements.\n  If finalized and enforced, expensing rules would kill broad-based \noptions programs available to rank-and-file workers and punish \ncompanies that treat employees as partners in innovation rather than \njust as simple factors of production. But worst of all, it would \nmisrepresent a firm's earnings because experts have said again and \nagain that stock options cannot be priced accurately in the short term.\n  The FASB received more than 250 comment letters during the period \nleading up to its current project on expensing stock options. Those \nletters presented a range of views on whether stock options constitute \na cost that should be deducted from earnings. Many respected economists \nand accountants stated clearly that options should not be expensed. But \nexpensing seems to be the only mechanism that the FASB is willing to \nconsider for improving investor understanding of a firm's financial \ncondition.\n  The experts I have worked with believe that better, more detailed \ndisclosure of stock option programs is the best mechanism for informing \ninvestors on those programs. And I do not believe that the FASB has \nadequately considered greater disclosure as an alternative to \nexpensing. Greater disclosure would provide investors with the \ninformation they need without discouraging the use of stock option \nprograms at innovative firms. At the very least, greater disclosure \nshould be tried and evaluated prior to imposing a new, disruptive \nexpensing regime.\n  Stock option programs mean opportunity for workers across gender \nlines and wage scales in my state. In Silicon Valley, the median home \nprice is $530,000. I know of single women working in Silicon Valley who \nhave only been able to own a home because of the stock options their \ncompanies offer them. For small businesses in my state, stock options \npermit cash-\n\n[[Page S5645]]\n\nstrapped businesses to attract and retain employees who want to share \nin the fruits of a growing company. The Woman's High Tech Coalition \nwrote to me last year:\n\n       The education process on stock options needs to be complete \n     in its understanding of what this opportunity has meant to so \n     many women, in particular, in terms of their ability to lift \n     themselves and their children out of a cycle that can affect \n     several generations.\n\n  Unfortunately, the process at the FASB is not designed to consider \nthe broader economic benefits of stock-option programs in its rule-\nmaking process. In failing to consider these benefits, the FASB's \nactions may end up doing more harm than good. And before we allow \nunaccountable officials to create new rules that effectively eliminate \nstock option programs, I strongly believe that we should be fully \ninformed about the broader impact on workers and productivity. A \nrecently published book, ``In the Company of Owners: The Truth About \nStock Options (And Why Every Employee Should Have Them)'' includes \nextensive research showing that broad-based stock option plans, over \nthe past 20 years, enhanced productivity, spurred capital formation, \nand enhanced shareholder value. We should carefully review the \nimplications of any new policy on stock options programs before \nimplementing them and hoping for positive results.\n  As a result of FASB's decision and the refusal to consider \nalternatives to expensing, I am joining Senator Ensign in introducing \nlegislation that calls for the Securities and Exchange Commission to \nundertake a thorough review of stock option programs and an assessment \nof the value of greater disclosure as an alternative to expensing. The \nbill sets a 3-year framework for evaluating this alternative to \nexpensing during which the SEC could not enforce any new accounting \nstandard on options that the FASB establishes.\n  If the SEC's studies indicate that greater disclosure is not getting \nenough information to investors, then we can revisit the issue. But we \nshould not let unelected, unaccountable FASB officials dictate policy \nthrough a rushed accounting standard. We must exercise our oversight \nfunction and carefully weigh alternatives that would be better for \nworkers, investors, and the economy as a whole.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/01/senate-section/article/S5645-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5645]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             TAIWAN SUPPORT\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today to bring to the attention of \nmy colleagues the importance of U.S. relations with Taiwan.\n  Most Americans have been focused on the two media showpiece events in \nrecent weeks--the conflict in Iraq and the SARS pandemic. I would note \nto the Senate that our relations with Taiwan--a key strategic ally for \nthe United States and a critical regional trading partner--should not \nbe overlooked.\n  In addition to its strategic role with the U.S., Taiwan has a strong \nmarket-based economy and burgeoning multi-party democratic system. It \nhas helped lead the modernization of Southeast Asia by demonstrating \nthe importance of respecting civil liberties and the rule of law.\n  A component of U.S. efforts to ensure regional stability is to \nmaintain strong relations with Taiwan, including assurances to protect \nthe island against military attacks. To support this effort, the U.S. \nhas a tradition of providing military assistance to Taiwan for the \npurpose of its self-defense. In recent years, this assistance has \nprimarily been in the form of sales of aircraft and advanced warning \nradars to the Taiwanese government. Most recently, the Bush \nadministration announced it would sell Taiwan a new assortment of \ndefense articles, including diesel submarines, P-3C anti-submarine \naircraft, and Kidd-class destroyers. I support this decision because it \nrecognizes the legitimate self-defense requirements of Taiwan, but does \nnot destabilize the sensitive relations between Taipei and Beijing.\n  The Key to ensuring peace and stability in the region is to promote \nhealthy U.S. relations with Taiwan and support efforts to encourage the \nPeople's Republic of China and Taiwan to resolve their differences \npeacefully. We should continue to pursue a means of supporting Taiwan \nwithout harming U.S. interests in China.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/01/senate-section/article/S5645-2", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5645]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       IN MEMORY OF HENRY BERMAN\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a very \ndear friend and colleague of mine, Henry Berman, who died on Tuesday, \nApril 27. He was just 92 years old.\n  He was a true Renaissance man--a man who loved life and loved people. \nIndeed, there was not a sweeter, gentler, or more generous person on \nearth than Henry Berman.\n  Born in 1910, in New Haven, CT, Henry made his way to San Francisco \nin the early 1930s. During the Great Depression he worked as laborer, \nthen sold butter and eggs, until he settled down as a consultant for \nJoseph Seagrams & Sons, where he worked for 56 years.\n  Long active in San Francisco politics and a dedicated philanthropist, \nI was lucky enough to have Henry serve as the Chairman of the Fire \nCommission during my tenure as mayor.\n  I was also fortunate enough to have him serve as my campaign \ntreasurer, in 1992, when I first ran for the United States Senate. I \nnever had a more loyal supporter.\n  He served the city of San Francisco up until the very end of his \nlife, when he was the president of the airport commission. According to \nhis son Ron, Henry was on the phone with airport leaders even during \nthe last days of his illness.\n  That's classic Henry for you: if he could walk, sure enough he would \nbe there. He was truly one of a kind.\n  He was also involved in a wide range of civic and charitable work, \nincluding the Anti-Defamation League of B'Nai B'rith, the American \nJewish Committee, Meals on Wheels and ``Mo's Kitchen,'' which provides \ndaily meals at Glide Memorial Methodist Church in San Francisco.\n  Henry was also an overseer of UC-San Francisco, a trustee of the \nMcLaren School of Business at the University of San Francisco, and a \nboard member of USF's Fromm Institute of Lifelong Learning.\n  When someone lives as long as Henry did--92 long, prosperous, and \nproductive years you can't conceive of the world without them.\n  My heartfelt condolences go out to his wonderful wife Sally, to his \nsons Ron and Bob, and to his grandchildren and great-grandchildren.\n  I will miss him greatly, but consider myself so very privileged to \nhave known Henry Berman to be able to call him my loyal colleague and \nmy dear, dear friend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/01/senate-section/article/S5645-3", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5645-S5646]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          RALPH KRISKA PERDUE\n\n Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I honor a pillar of the \nFairbanks business community and a respected Athabaskan Elder, Ralph \nKriska Perdue, who passed on early Tuesday morning at the age of 73. I \ndoubt that most folks in Interior Alaska knew his real age. You see, \nfor years Ralph's wife, Dorothy, conducted a 39th birthday sale, every \nChristmas, at the family store, Perdue's Jewelers.\n  Ralph was born on December 16, 1929 in the village of Koyukuk on the \nYukon River. He became interested in making jewelry around 1946 and in \n1961 opened a jewelry store in downtown Fairbanks. Ralph was a \ndetermined individual. He once told a reporter for the Fairbanks Daily \nNews-Miner, ``To me, there is satisfaction that something is done the \nway it should be done, whether it's a piece of jewelry or anything that \nconfronts me.'' The Fairbanks economy has experienced booms and busts, \nbut Perdue's Jewelers has grown and prospered.\n  Ralph will be remembered in Interior Alaska for many things. A bridge \nbetween the Native community and the broader community, he served for 6 \nyears as president of the Tanana Chiefs Conference and as a member of \nthe Fairbanks North Star Borough Assembly and the Fairbanks North Star \nBorough School Board.\n  He will be dearly remembered as the father of the Fairbanks Native \nAssociation, which he helped found in 1963. Today, the Fairbanks Native \nAssociation has an annual operating budget of about $13 million and a \nworkforce of\n\n[[Page S5646]]\n\n300 people. It provides a variety of social services to the people of \nFairbanks, including a very successful regional alcoholism treatment \ncenter, which was appropriately named the ``Ralph Perdue Center.''\n  Annette Freiburger, executive director of the Fairbanks Native \nAssociation (FNA), is quoted in the News-Miner as follows, ``Ralph has \nalways served as a guide and inspiration for FNA. We recognized him as \nour FNA chief, the only chief we have in Fairbanks.''\n  Ralph was also the devoted father of Karen Perdue Bettisworth, the \ndistinguished former commissioner of the Alaska Department of Health \nand Social Services, and of Mona Perdue Jones. I extend to Dorothy, to \nKaren and to Mona, my deepest condolences and I join with the Fairbanks \ncommunity in extending my appreciation to the late Chief Ralph Kriska \nPerdue for a job well done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/01/senate-section/article/S5646-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5646]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     RECOGNIZING LORRAINE JOHNSON, 2003 GEORGIA TEACHER OF THE YEAR\n\n Mr. MILLER.

This past year, Ms. Johnson \nhas been on a sabbatical to travel across the State of Georgia giving \nspeeches and conducting workshops for her peers at other Georgia \nschools.\n  Ms. Johnson told a reporter recently that she hopes she can inspire \nother teachers to have pride in their profession, and I think she is \nachieving that goal. Though her commitment and dedication to teaching \nshe has influenced hundreds of students and made Georgia and our entire \ncountry a better place.\n Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay a special \ntribute to Lorraine Johnson of Newnan, GA. Lorraine Johnson is an \noutstanding Georgia educator.\n  Lorraine Johnson was recently honored and recognized as one of four \nfinalists by President George W. Bush at the White House for the \nNational Teacher of the Year award.\n  Top notch teachers, like Lorraine Johnson, work day and night to make \na difference to our Nation's young people as they prepare for their \nfuture. These are our true American heroes in our communities, in our \nStates and in our Nation. As the husband of a retired teacher who spent \n35 years in the classroom, I know first hand the deep commitment, tough \nchallenges, and endless efforts that go along with being a dedicated \nteacher. There is no doubt about it: Lorraine Johnson is a dedicated \neducator.\n  Lorraine Johnson teaches seventh grade language arts at Arnall Middle \nSchool in Newnan, GA. In my home State of Georgia, Lorraine's \nexcellence is no secret. She was named Georgia's Teacher of the Year \nfor 2003 for her remarkable efforts.\n  It was a real honor and a privilege to share in a special White House \nceremony praising Lorraine's hard work and dedication. President George \nW. Bush, U.S. Secretary of Education Rodney Paige and many other \nlawmakers also commended Lorraine Johnson for her accomplishments.\n  Lorraine Johnson of Newnan, GA, is truly an outstanding educator. Not \nonly is she an inspiration to Georgians, but she is an inspiration to \nall Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/01/senate-section/article/S5646-2", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5646-S5647]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HONORING BOB PROFT\n\n Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I ask that the following two \ntributes honoring the life of the late Bob Proft--a proud Minnesotan, \nrespected author, and brave World War II veteran--be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The tributes follow.\n\n                   [From the Star Tribune, Jan. 1996]\n\n                          A Tribute to Heroes\n\n                            (By Chuck Haga)\n\n       Fifty years ago, Congress awarded a Medal of Honor to Jimmy \n     LaBelle, a 19-year-old Marine from Columbia Heights and one \n     of Bob Proft's best friends.\n       Proft, a B-17 radio operator during the war, always \n     wondered what his buddy had done to receive the country's \n     highest military decoration, but he could find no lists, no \n     compilation of citations.\n       So Proft published a book. Working out of his sign-\n     painter's garage in Columbia Heights, he researched the \n     history of the medal, compiled lists of the recipients and \n     their citations--from the Civil War through Vietnam--and in \n     1980 assembled an encyclopedic document of more than 1,100 \n     pages. With co-publisher Mitch DeMars of Columbia Heights, he \n     brought out an updated edition last year.\n       Now anybody can look up Jimmy LaBelle's name and find out \n     just what he did before he died on March 8, 1945, on Iwo \n     Jima.\n       ``I don't think there's anything else I've ever done that's \n     given me more satisfaction,'' Proft said.\n       He is a fit man of 70, earnest in his cause but self-\n     effacing when talking about his own military service. ``I \n     didn't do anything heroic whatsoever,'' he said.\n       But heroes matter to him.\n       ``It bothers me that you can talk to young people and they \n     don't even know what the Medal of Honor is,'' he said. ``They \n     know John Wayne. They know `Rambo.' Real heroes are \n     forgotten.''\n       LaBelle was a soft-spoken, unassuming teenager, ``Just one \n     of the guys growing up in the Heights,'' Proft said. During \n     high school, he worked at a hamburger joint called Virg's on \n     Central Ave. He boxed in intramurals.\n       About 15 years after the war, Proft was painting a sign \n     near Virg's. As he passed the hamburger joint, he thought \n     about LaBelle and his Medal of Honor.\n       ``It struck me that I didn't know anything about what he \n     had done,'' he said.\n       He went to his local library, then to the Minneapolis \n     Public Library. He wrote to government and military sources. \n     A friend helped with the search, but they came up empty-\n     handed.\n       In the late 1960s, the U.S. Government Printing Office \n     compiled lists of recipients with their citations, he said, \n     but that material was distributed only to federal depository \n     libraries and couldn't be checked out.\n       Proft thought there should be something that could go in \n     school libraries, something that young hamburger-flippers \n     could stumble across.\n       ``You can't sit and read this book like a novel,'' he said. \n     ``The citations would start blending together. But if you \n     pick out a few citations at a time, they can really grip \n     you.''\n       The honor roll lists 47 Minnesotans, including Dale \n     Wayrynen of McGregor, who received the medal posthumously for \n     gallantry in Vietnam. Ten of the Minnesotans were natives of \n     other countries: Germany, Austria, Norway, England, Ireland \n     and Canada.\n       Proft's favorite is the citation for Nathanial Gwynne, who \n     was 15 and trying to talk his way into the 13th Ohio Cavalry \n     on July 30, 1864, at Petersburg, Va. When the unit charged a \n     Confederate position, Gwynne rode along.\n       The Yankees were forced to retreat, leaving their flag and \n     battle standards. Young Gwynne charged back along, gathered \n     up the colors and--despite having an arm almost shot off--\n     brought them back.\n       ``Somebody said, `That young man should get the Medal of \n     Honor,' '' Proft said. ``Somebody else said, `Yes, but we'd \n     better get him mustered first.' ''\n       Since the medal was first presented in 1863, 3,420 have \n     been awarded. Eighteen people received two medals.\n       An award requires at least two witnesses, and the action \n     must involve ``gallantry beyond the call of duty'' and the \n     risk of death.\n       In 1916, a congressional panel reviewed records of medals \n     awarded to that point and rescinded 910, Proft said, because \n     they didn't meet those standards.\n       Proft's book includes the citation for Alvin York, of \n     course, the conscientious objector from Tennessee who became \n     a World War I hero. Gary Cooper portrayed him in the film \n     ``Sgt. York.''\n       And there are the stories of two living Minnesotans who \n     received the Medal of Honor: Don Rudolph of Bovey, for \n     actions in the Philippines during World II, and Mike \n     Colalillo of Duluth, for actions against German forces near \n     the end of the war in Europe.\n       Proft's labor was a good thing, said Rudolph, 74. ``It gets \n     it into the schools and the city libraries.''\n       The Veterans of Foreign Wars post in Grand Rapids, Minn., \n     bought 12 of the books for local schools and libraries, he \n     said.\n       Rudolph has had his own copy of the book signed by about \n     200 recipients of the medal. Today, only 184 recipients are \n     living.\n       ``I've read the citations of everybody in the book,'' he \n     said.\n       His own citation tells of his actions Feb. 5, when his \n     platoon had been pinned down at Munoz, on Luzon: ``While \n     administering first aid on the battlefield, he observed enemy \n     fire issuing from a nearby culvert. Crawling to the culvert \n     with rifle and grenades, he killed\n\n[[Page S5647]]\n\n     three of the enemy concealed there. He then worked his way \n     across open terrain toward a line of enemy pillboxes. . . .''\n       He used grenades, a pick and his rifle to put seven \n     pillboxes out of commission. ``Later, when his platoon was \n     attacked by an enemy tank, he advanced under covering fire, \n     climbed to the top of the tank and dropped a white \n     phosphorous grenade through the turret, destroying the \n     crew.''\n       Rudolph said he made it through all that without a scratch.\n       ``I've said many times that I really don't know why I did \n     it or why I got the medal,'' he said. ``But I knew I had to \n     do it. Otherwise we were going to lose more men.''\n       It was about a month later that LaBelle died on Iwo Jima.\n       He was a private in the 5th Marine Division. On the night \n     of March 8, as Japanese forces tried to break through \n     American lines, a grenade landed in the foxhole that LaBelle \n     shared with two other Marines.\n       He shouted a warning, then fell on the grenade, absorbing \n     most if its impact with his body.\n       ``His dauntless courage, cool decision and valiant spirit \n     of self-sacrifice in the face of certain death reflect the \n     highest credit on Pfc. LaBelle,'' his posthumous citation \n     reads.\n       Medals of Honor awarded in major conflicts: Civil War \n     1,520; Indian campaigns (1861-1898) 428; Spanish-American War \n     109; World War I 124; World War II 433; Korean Conflict 131; \n     Vietnam 239.

That \n     means Mother Teresa has too. Ah, priorities.''\n       That is not to say Proft had no passion.\n       ``We cannot abide a government of the people, by the \n     lobbyists, for the privileged and remain a bona-fide \n     democracy. If this government of We the People is not, in \n     fact and spirit, of us and by us and for us, we are operating \n     with half-truths at best. And we are mocked by crafty \n     hypocrites every time we are unctuously assured that we \n     control this carefully designed system. In whatever manner \n     and to whatever degree our representation is tainted, that is \n     the manner and degree our government is a counterfeit of what \n     our founding fathers created.''\n       He lost his fettle for sports, but not for columnist \n     Patrick Reusse.\n       ``Older now, I seldom read the sports pages. However, \n     thumbing through, I can't pass up Pat Reusse. For all the \n     proper reasons I'm attracted to that face. It just came to me \n     he reminds me of New York's Jimmy Breslin. With that face \n     Reusse had to be a sportswriter or some guy living under the \n     Third Avenue bridge. Now don't get me wrong, I still don't \n     know if I should like this guy. But my, my, how he can write! \n     I'll bet my dentures Reusse is a closet poet. Robert Browning \n     or Robert Service type, I don't know.''\n       His love for holiday and tradition, spring and freedom and, \n     above all, for family is expressed in these letters some \n     readers may have saved to savor:\n       ``Contracted Christmas greeting: Ho!''\n       ``Sure signs autumn cometh: falling leaves, long sleeves.''\n       ``Our nation is free. For that reason we own everything we \n     have to those we remember this day.''\n       ``Any force at any time in any country that can keep a \n     loving father from a loving son for one second is a force of \n     evil. A mob at any time in any country may have the power to \n     prevent a loving father from reaching his loving son but it \n     will never have the right.''\n       His Veterans Day letter made him dear to the editor:\n       ``While it is fitting and proper that we enjoy the fruits \n     of our power and plenty, we must not forget those who destiny \n     decreed should pay that price. Today is Veterans Day, set \n     aside to commemorate that unique fraternity. Please, you \n     needn't genuflect. Just give a knowing nod, and maybe a \n     smile.''\n       Proft enlisted in World War II and was training to fly \n     bombers when peace came.\n       His love for country was funneled into publishing a 1,248-\n     page book listing Medal of Honor Recipients and their \n     official citations. Humility dictated that his initials, not \n     his name, be on the cover.\n       The final letter from Proft, 78, arrived last week. He died \n     at home early Thursday morning after a short illness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/01/senate-section/article/S5647-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5647]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING DR. MARTHA MYERS\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise today to remember a \nselfless American, Dr. Martha Myers. Many know Dr. Myers as one of the \ntwo Southern Baptist missionaries recently murdered by extremists in \nYemen. She represents the bests in missionary service. She was, by her \naid to those in need, a demonstrated friend of the people of Yemen and \nin the end, she laid down her life for them. Greater love hath no one \nthan this. Her death has touched me deeply as it has touched many \nworldwide. It has also, unfortunately, heightened our concern for \nChristian missionaries throughout the world.\n  Dr. Myers was educated in my home State of Alabama where she earned \ndegrees from both Samford University and University of Alabama Medical \nSchool. The daughter of the State of Alabama's long time health \nofficer, Dr. Ira Myers, she was educated and trained as an \nobstetrician. Instead of seeking monetary gain, like a modern day \nNehemiah she dedicated the rest of her life in selfless service to the \nindigent families of Yemen. She spent 24 years as a medical missionary \nin Yemen ministering by example. Her colleagues have stated that she \noften slept in her office cubicle to save money to give to poor \nfamilies in communities surrounding the hospital.\n  I find it particularly telling that it was her choice to be buried on \nthe grounds of the hospital in Yemen. I find this important because it \nshows a total and complete devotion to the difficult and selfless work \nshe felt called to do. It demonstrated her total commitment without \nthought of turning back. Former professors and college friends say that \nher sense of calling to the field of missions was ``crystal clear.'' \nThey also said it was evident to everyone around her that this clear \ncall to serve others empowered and motivated her even as a college \nfreshman in 1963.\n  Dr. Martha Myers' ability to rise above personal interest in service \nof others goes far beyond what most people can conceive. Dr. Mike \nHowell, her former biology professor, summarized her life and \ncommitment well in saying ``There aren't many people willing to \ndedicate their life to people. That is the greatest calling of a \nChristian.''\n  While the world has lost a selfless servant, We may hope that the \nlife of Martha Myers will serve as an inspiration for others. It \ndemonstrates that religious faith can be the basis for a life dedicated \nto others, even if those served have a different religion. Dr. Myers \ndid not limit her patients to Christians. She served all in need, and \nshe never forced her views on anyone.\n  In these days of terrorism and the prospect of war, our world should \nthink deeply about the well lived life of Dr. Martha Myers. In such \nloving humility can come the seeds of a more peaceful world.\n  Some may say that this senseless murder proves that radicalism rules \nthe day and that such acts can only be dealt with by war. But, perhaps \nnot. Certainly, some radicalized terrorist, someone with a twisted view \nof their faith, can end a lifetime of work. Still, such evil acts \ncannot erase the good she has done. And, maybe, just maybe, the \nthousands of poor, sick, and dying that she treated and comforted will \nhave a different view of the United States, a different view of the \nWest, and a different view of freedom and faith as a result of her life \nwell lived. In that we can all take comfort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/01/senate-section/article/S5647-2", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5647-S5648]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                JARISSE J. SANBORN, B.G. U.S. AIR FORCE\n\n Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a great \nAlaskan upon the occasion of her promotion to Brigadier General in the \nUnited States Air Force.\n  I am speaking of Jarisse J. Sanborn who, on April 1, 2003, became the \nfirst active duty woman ever promoted to Brigadier General in the Judge \nAdvocate Corps of any armed service in this country. Upon her \npromotion, General Sanborn was assigned to U.S. Transportation Command \nand the Air Mobility Command, where she serves as the Staff Judge \nAdvocate to both commands.\n  General Sanborn, the daughter of a career Navy officer, began her Air \nForce career after graduating Magna Cum Laude from Randolph-Macon\n\n[[Page S5648]]\n\nWoman's College in Virginia. After serving as a squadron and wing \nexecutive officer, she was selected for the Air Force-funded legal \neducation program, graduating from Creighton Law School in Omaha, NE, \nagain Magna Cum Laude. She is also a graduate of the National War \nCollege.\n  General Sanborn has had a distinguished legal career, including her \nmost recent assignment as the Staff Judge Advocate for the North \nAmerican Aerospace Defense Command, better known by its acronym NORAD, \nand U.S. Northern Command, the newly created unified command \nresponsible for the homeland defense of the United States. General \nSanborn also has been the Staff Judge Advocate for U.S. Space Command, \nAir Force Space Command, and Alaska Command.\n  From her time as head of Alaska Command at Fort Richardson in \nAnchorage, she remains a resident of Alaska, where she and her husband \nAl still own a home in Eagle River. They have two sons: Tyler and John.\n  Brigadier General Sanborn is a veteran of Operation Desert Storm, \nwhere she earned the Bronze Star as the Staff Judge Advocate for the \nFourth Fighter Wing deployed to Oman and Saudi Arabia.\n  Now, at a time when women are making such important contributions to \nour efforts in Iraq, it's very appropriate that we recognize the \nsuccess of this fine officer. It is also appropriate that we celebrate \nthis important step for all women in the military. General Sanborn \ntruly makes all Americans proud of the capabilities and accomplishments \nof our Armed Forces.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/01/senate-section/article/S5648-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5648]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               MASSACHUSETTS STATE TROOPER SCOTT McDONALD\n\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I pay tribute to one of \nMassachusetts' finest law enforcement officers--Massachusetts State \nTrooper Scott McDonald. Recently, Trooper McDonald was honored by the \nMassachusetts State Police with a Medal of Lifesaving, awarded to \nbestow recognition upon troopers who undertake significant actions in \nthe saving of another life.\n  On August 4, 2002, Trooper Scott McDonald was on patrol when he was \ndispatched to a motor vehicle accident in the town of Deerfield. Upon \narrival, he observed a truck overturned on the road. As the driver was \nwithout a pulse and not breathing, he immediately began CPR. While a \npassing motorist stopped, identified herself as a doctor and said she \nwould pronounce the victim dead, Scott continued lifesaving efforts. \nAmazingly, the driver was ultimately revived and flown to Baystate \nMedical Center in Springfield.\n  Trooper McDonald is a fine example of the Commonwealth's outstanding \nfirst responder community. I rise to join the Massachusetts State \nPolice, the City of Holyoke, and Scott's family and friends in honoring \na great American, Massachusetts State Trooper Scott McDonald.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/01/senate-section/article/S5648-2", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5648]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/01/senate-section/article/S5648-3", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5648]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/01/senate-section/article/S5648-4", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5648]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:36 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1350.

A bill to provide Federal assistance to States and local \njurisdictions to prosecute hate crimes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it's a privilege to join my colleagues in \nintroducing this legislation to combat hate crimes. Hate crimes are a \nviolation of all our country stands for. They send the poisonous \nmessage that some Americans deserve to be victimized solely because of \nwho they are. Like acts of terrorism, hate crimes have an impact far \ngreater than the impact on the individual victims. They are crimes \nagainst entire communities, against the whole Nation, and against the \nfundamental ideals on which America was founded. As Attorney General \nAshcroft has said, ``Criminal acts of hate run counter to what is best \nin America--our belief in equality and freedom.''\n  Although there was a significant overall reduction in violent crimes \nduring the 1990s, the number of hate crimes continued to grow. \nAccording to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, 9,730 hate crimes \nwere reported in the United States in 2001. That is over 26 hate crimes \na day, every day. More than 83,000 hate crimes have been reported since \n1991.\n  The need for an effective national response is as compelling as it \nhas ever been. Hate crimes against Arabs and Muslims rose dramatically \nin the weeks following the September 11 terrorist attacks. These hate \ncrimes included murder, beatings, arson, attacks on mosques, shootings, \nand other assaults. In 2001, anti-Islamic incidents were the second \nhighest-reported type of hate crimes based on religion--second only to \nanti-Jewish hate crimes.\n\n[[Page S5653]]\n\nLos Angeles and Chicago reported a massive increase in the number of \nanti-Arab and anti-Muslim crimes after 9/11.\n  Hate crimes based on sexual orientation continue to be a serious \ndanger, constituting 14 percent of all hate crimes reported.\n  Each person's life is valuable, and even one life lost is too many. \nIt is not the frequency of hate crimes alone that makes these acts of \nviolence so serious. It is the terror and intimidation they inflict on \nthe victims, their families, their communities, and, in some cases, the \nentire Nation.\n  Congress cannot sit silent while this hatred spreads. It is long past \ntime for us to do more to end hate-motivated violence. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act will strengthen the ability of Federal, \nState and local governments to investigate and prosecute these vicious \nand senseless crimes. Our legislation is supported by over 175 law \nenforcement, civil rights, civic, and religious organizations.\n  The current Federal law on hate crimes was passed soon after the \nassassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Today, however, it is a \ngeneration out of date. It has two significant deficiencies. It does \nnot cover hate crimes based on sexual orientation, gender, or \ndisability. And even in cases of hate crimes based on race, religion, \nor ethnic background, it contains excessive restrictions requiring \nproof that the victims were attacked because they were engaged in \ncertain ``federally protected activities.''\n  Our bill is designed to close these substantial loopholes. It has six \nprincipal provisions: 1. It removes the ``federally protected \nactivity'' barrier. 2. It adds sexual orientation, gender and \ndisability to the existing categories of race, color, religion, and \nnational origin. 3. It protects State interests with a strict \ncertification procedure that requires the Federal Government to consult \nwith local officials before bringing a Federal case. 4. It offers \nfederal assistance to State and local law enforcement officials to \ninvestigate and prosecute heated crimes in any of the federal \ncategories. 5. It offers training grants for local law enforcement. 6. \nIt amends the Federal Hate Crime Statistics Act to add gender to the \nexisting categories of race, religion, ethnic background, sexual \norientation, and disability.\n  These much needed changes in current law will help ensure that the \nDepartment of Justice has what it needs to combat the growing problem \nof hate-motivated violence more effectively.\n  Nothing in the bill prohibits or punishes speech, expression, or \nassociation in any way--even ``hate speech.'' It addresses only violent \nactions that result in death or injury. The Supreme Court has ruled \nrepeatedly--and as recently as this year, in the cross-burning decision \nVirginia v. Black--that a hate crimes statute that considers bias \nmotivation directly connected to a defendant's criminal conduct does \nnot violate the First Amendment. No one has a First Amendment right to \ncommit a crime.\n  A strong Federal role in prosecuting hate crimes is essential, \nbecause crimes have an impact far greater than their impact on \nindividual victims. Nevertheless, our bill fully respects the primary \nrole of state and local law enforcement in responding to violent crime. \nThe vast majority of hate crimes will continue to be prosecuted at the \nstate and local level. The bill authorizes the Justice Department to \nassist State and local authorities in hate crimes cases, but it \nauthorizes Federal prosecutions only when a state does not have \njurisdiction, or when it asks the Federal Government to take \njurisdiction, or when it fails to act against hate-motivated violence. \nIn other words, the bill establishes an appropriate back-up for State \nand local law enforcement, to deal with hate crimes in cases where \nstates request assistance, or cases that would not otherwise be \neffectively investigated and prosecuted.\n  Working cooperatively, State, local and Federal law enforcement \nofficials have the best chance to bring the perpetrators of hate crimes \nto justice. Federal resources and expertise in the identification and \nproof of hate crimes can provide invaluable assistance to state and \nlocal authorities without undermining the traditional role of states in \nprosecuting crimes. As Attorney General Ashcroft has said of current \nlaw, ``Cooperation between federal agents and local law enforcement \nofficers and between Justice Department prosecutors and local \nprosecutors has been outstanding.'' And it will continue to be so, and \nbe even more effective, when this legislation is enacted into law.\n  Now is the time for Congress to speak with one voice and insist that \nall Americans will be guaranteed the equal protection of the laws. Now \nis the time to make combating hate crimes a high national priority. The \nLocal Law Enforcement Enhancement Act is a needed response to a serious \nproblem that continues to plague the nation, and I urge the Senate to \nsupport it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 966\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Local Law Enforcement \n     Enhancement Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The incidence of violence motivated by the actual or \n     perceived race, color, religion, national origin, gender, \n     sexual orientation, or disability of the victim poses a \n     serious national problem.\n       (2) Such violence disrupts the tranquility and safety of \n     communities and is deeply divisive.\n       (3) State and local authorities are now and will continue \n     to be responsible for prosecuting the overwhelming majority \n     of violent crimes in the United States, including violent \n     crimes motivated by bias. These authorities can carry out \n     their responsibilities more effectively with greater Federal \n     assistance.\n       (4) Existing Federal law is inadequate to address this \n     problem.\n       (5) The prominent characteristic of a violent crime \n     motivated by bias is that it devastates not just the actual \n     victim and the family and friends of the victim, but \n     frequently savages the community sharing the traits that \n     caused the victim to be selected.\n       (6) Such violence substantially affects interstate commerce \n     in many ways, including--\n       (A) by impeding the movement of members of targeted groups \n     and forcing such members to move across State lines to escape \n     the incidence or risk of such violence; and\n       (B) by preventing members of targeted groups from \n     purchasing goods and services, obtaining or sustaining \n     employment, or participating in other commercial activity.\n       (7) Perpetrators cross State lines to commit such violence.\n       (8) Channels, facilities, and instrumentalities of \n     interstate commerce are used to facilitate the commission of \n     such violence.\n       (9) Such violence is committed using articles that have \n     traveled in interstate commerce.\n       (10) For generations, the institutions of slavery and \n     involuntary servitude were defined by the race, color, and \n     ancestry of those held in bondage. Slavery and involuntary \n     servitude were enforced, both prior to and after the adoption \n     of the 13th amendment to the Constitution of the United \n     States, through widespread public and private violence \n     directed at persons because of their race, color, or \n     ancestry, or perceived race, color, or ancestry. Accordingly, \n     eliminating racially motivated violence is an important means \n     of eliminating, to the extent possible, the badges, \n     incidents, and relics of slavery and involuntary servitude.\n       (11) Both at the time when the 13th, 14th, and 15th \n     amendments to the Constitution of the United States were \n     adopted, and continuing to date, members of certain religious \n     and national origin groups were and are perceived to be \n     distinct ``races''. Thus, in order to eliminate, to the \n     extent possible, the badges, incidents, and relics of \n     slavery, it is necessary to prohibit assaults on the basis of \n     real or perceived religions or national origins, at least to \n     the extent such religions or national origins were regarded \n     as races at the time of the adoption of the 13th, 14th, and \n     15th amendments to the Constitution of the United States.\n       (12) Federal jurisdiction over certain violent crimes \n     motivated by bias enables Federal, State, and local \n     authorities to work together as partners in the investigation \n     and prosecution of such crimes.\n       (13) The problem of crimes motivated by bias is \n     sufficiently serious, widespread, and interstate in nature as \n     to warrant Federal assistance to States and local \n     jurisdictions.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITION OF HATE CRIME.\n\n       In this Act, the term ``hate crime'' has the same meaning \n     as in section 280003(a) of the Violent Crime Control and Law \n     Enforcement Act of 1994 (28 U.S.C. 994 note).\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \ncapital gain treatment under section 631(b) of such Code for outright \nsales of timber by landowners; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nwhich will simplify and update a provision of the tax code that affects \nthe sale of timber. It is both a simplification measure and a fairness \nmeasure. I call it the Timber Tax Simplification Act.\n  Under current law, landowners that are occasional sellers of timer \nare often classified by the Internal Revenue Service as ``dealers.'' As \na result, the small landowner is forced to choose, because of the tax \ncode, between two different methods of selling their timber. The first \nmethod, ``lump sum sales provides for good business practice but is \nsubjected to a high income tax. The second method ``pay-as-cut'' sales, \nallows for lower capital gains tax treatment, but often results in an \nunderrealization of the fair value of the contract. Why, one might ask, \ndo these conflicting incentives exist for our Nation's timber growers?\n  Ealier in this century, outright, or ``lump sum,'' sales on a cash in \nadvance, sealed basis, were associated with a ``cut and run'' mentality \nthat did not promote good forest management. ``Pay-as-cut sales,'' \nhowever, in which a timber owner is only paid for timber that is \nharvested, were associated with ``enlighted'' resource management. \nConsequently, in 1943, Congress, in an effect to provide an incentive \nfor improved forest management, passed legislation that allowed capital \ngains treatment under 631(b) of the IRS Code for pay-as-cut sales, \nleaving lump-sum sales to pay the much higher rate of income tax. It is \nsaid that President Roosevelt opposed the bill and almost vetoed it.\n  Today, however, Section 631(b) like so many provisions in the IRS \nCode, is outdated. Forest management practices are much different from \nwhat they were in 1943 and lump-sum sales are no longer associated with \npoor forest management. And while there are occasional special \nsituations where other methods may be more appropriate, most timber \nowners prefer this method over the ``pay-as-cut'' method. The reasons \nare simple: title to the timber is transferred upon the closing of the \nsale and the buyer assumes the risk of any physical loss of timber to \nfire, insects, disease, storms, etc. Furthermore, the price to be paid \nfor the timber is determined and received at the time of the sale.\n\n  Unfortunately, in order for timber owners to qualify for the \nfavorable capital gains treatment, they must market their timber on a \n``pay-as-cut'' basis under Section 631(b) which requires timber owners \nto sell their timber with a ``retained economic interest.'' This means \nthat the timber owner, not the buyer, must bear the risk of any \nphysical loss during the timber sale contract period and must be paid \nonly for the timber that is actually harvested. As a result, this type \nof sale can be subject to fraud and abuse by the timber buyer. Since \nthe buyer pays only for the timber that is removed and scaled, there is \nan incentive to waste poor quality timber by breaking the tree during \nthe logging process, underscaling the timber, or removing the timber \nwithout scaling. But because 631(b) provides for the favorable tax \ntreatment, many timber owners are forced into exposing themselves to \nunnecessary risk of loss by having to market their timber in this \ndisadvantageous way instead of the more preferable lump-sum method.\n  Like many of the provisions in the tax code, Section 631(b) is \noutdated and prevents good forestry business management. Timber \nfarmers, who have usually spent decades producing their timber \n``crop,'' should be able to receive equal tax treatment regardless of \nthe method used for marketing their timber.\n  In the past, the Joint Committee on Taxation has studied this \nlegislation to consider what impact it might have on the Treasury and \nfound that it would have no real cost--only a ``negligible change'' \naccording to their analysis.\n  The IRS has no business stepping in and dictating the kind of sales \ncontract a landowner must choose. My legislation will provide greater \nconsistency by removing the exclusive ``retained economic interest'' \nrequirement in the IRC Section 631(b). Reform of 631(b) is important to \nour Nation's non-industrial, private landowners because it will improve \nthe economic viability of their forestry investments and protect the \ntaxpayer from unnecessary exposure to risk of loss. This in turn will \nbenefit the entire forest products industry, the U.S. economy and \nespecially small landowners.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Corzine, and Mr. \n        Reed):\n  S. 969. A bill to enhance the security and safety of the Nation by \nincreasing the time allowed to track terrorists during periods of \nelevated alert, closing loopholes that have allowed terrorists to \nacquire firearms, maintaining records of certain handgun transfers \nduring periods of heightened terrorist risk, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a critical piece \nof legislation, the Homeland Security Gun Safety Act.\n  In the aftermath of the tragic events of 9-11, the Federal Government \nhas reassessed the Nation's vulnerabilities to acts and threats of \nterrorism.\n  And in response, the United States Congress gave the Department of \nJustice expanded powers to detain suspected terrorists, conduct \nsurveillance and obtain confidential information on American citizens. \nIn addition, we have created the new Department of Homeland Security--\nthe largest reorganization of the Federal Government since the 1940s.\n  In short, the events of 9-11 required us to reevaluate our safety \nconcerns and the security of the Nation.\n  Echoing this need, President Bush said before the United Nations on \nNovember 10, 2001, that ``we have the responsibility to deny weapons to \nterrorists and to actively prevent private citizens from providing \nthem.''\n  I wholeheartedly agree with this statement. And I believe the \nAmerican people want the U.S. Senate to follow through with concrete \nlegislative action.\n  However, we have failed to address a significant remaining threat: \nthe accessibility to firearms and explosives within our own borders.\n  How can we truly protect this Nation, if we do not enact legislation \nwhich prevents terrorists and potential terrorists from acquiring guns \nin the United States?\n  Terrorists have identified the lax gun laws of the United States as a \nmeans to advance their evil goal to terrorize and harm the American \npeople.\n  In December 2001, during the war on terror, we attacked a terrorist \ntraining facility south of Kabul. Found among the rubble at that \nfacility was a manual called: ``How I Can Train Myself for Jihad.''\n  This manual, contains an entire section on ``Firearms Training'' and \nsingles out the United States for its easy availability of firearms. It \nstipulates that terrorists living in the U.S. should ``obtain an \nassault weapon legally, preferably AK-47 or variations.'' It also \nadvises would-be terrorsts on how they should conduct themselves in \norder to avoid arousing suspicion as they amass and transport firearms.\n  There are other examples where terrorists have sought to take \nadvantage of this nation's lax gun laws.\n  On the eve of the September 11 terrorist attack, on September 10, \n2001, a Federal jury convicted Ali Boumelhem, a known member of the \nterrorist group Hezbollah on seven counts of weapons charges and \nconspiracy to ship weapons and ammunition to Lebanon.\n  And we have seen how firearms can be used to terrorize an entire \ncommunity.\n  We are all familiar with the case of John Muhammad and John Malvo, \nwho terrorized the Washington, DC area for more than three weeks as \nthey embarked on a shooting spree with a sniper rifle, shooting 13 \ninnocent people before being caught.\n\n[[Page S5656]]\n\n  Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge agrees that there is a \ndangerous link between guns and terror. During his confirmation hearing \nbefore Governmental Affairs Committee on January 17, 2003, in response \nto a question I asked him about guns and terror, Secretary Ridge said:\n\n       [W]hen anyone uses a firearm, whether it's the kind of \n     terrorism that we are trying to combat with al Qaeda and \n     these non-state terrorists, or as a former district attorney \n     involved in the conviction of an individual who used firearms \n     against innocent citizens--regardless of how we define \n     terrorism, that individual and that family felt that they \n     were victims of a terrorist act. Brandishing a firearm in \n     front of anybody under any set of circumstances is a \n     terrorist act and needs to be dealt with.\n\n  Well, the Homeland Security Gun Safety Act deals with it. The Act \ndeals with this threat that leaves America especially vulnerable to \nfuture terrorist attacks.\n  The Homeland Security Gun Safety Act would enact specific measures \nthat would help prevent terrorists from acquiring firearms within our \nown borders.\n  Under current law, there are cases when law enforcement is blocked \nfrom conducting an adequate investigation when a terrorist or criminal \ntries to buy a gun.\n  Current law says if law enforcement takes over three days to conduct \na background check on someone who wants a weapon--just hand over the \ngun.\n  That is ludicrous--especially when we are in an elevated state of \nterrorist threat.\n  When we are at Code Yellow, the Department of Homeland Security has \ndetermined that we are at a significant risk of terrorist attack.\n  The bill I am introducing today would suspend these loopholes in our \ngun safety laws when we are at Code Yellow or above in the interest of \nhomeland security.\n  The three-day limit on law enforcement is nothing more than a \nloophole in our laws put there by the gun lobby.\n  And it's a dangerous loophole--a recent study showed that, from \nDecember 1998 to June 2001, nearly 10,000 people who should not have \nbeen permitted to buy guns, did receive guns because the three-day \nperiod passed before law enforcement could finish a background check.\n  Our bill will also require that the Federal Government retain records \nof weapons transactions while we are in an elevated state of alert. \nThere is no reason we should handicap law enforcement during such a \ndangerous time.\n  This bill will also close a number of loopholes that have allowed \nrogue gun dealers to skirt the law. These are the same few gun dealers \nthat are now the subject of lawsuits across the country.\n  These dangerous loopholes that the gun lobby built into our gun laws \nnow pose a major threat to homeland security.\n  This bill will help shut down those loopholes. The bill would require \ngun dealers to: immediately report ``missing'' guns or face suspension \nof their license; and put appropriate security measures in place to \nprevent theft of their weapons; and check with the FBI's Stolen Gun \nRegistry to make sure that secondhand weapons they purchase are not \nstolen.\n  This bill will also step up enforcement of gun dealers: law \nenforcement would not be restricted in its ability to inspect dealers. \nCurrently, law enforcement is only allowed one unannounced inspection \nper year.\n  The bill will also increase the penalties for violations of gun \ndealer laws to a felony. Right now, the maximum penalty is only a \nmisdemeanor. It has no teeth.\n  I know the NRA will cry wolf to gun owners about this bill. But this \nbill will not affect the vast majority of honest, law abiding Americans \nwho want to purchase guns. This bill focuses on preventing weapons from \ngetting into the hands of terrorists and criminals.\n  Over 75 percent of background checks are performed in mere minutes. \nHowever, there are those purchasers who raise red flags that require \nfurther investigation.\n  Those are red flags we can no longer afford to ignore.\n  When we are at Code Yellow, everyday Americans are prevented from \ntaking a tour of the White House--but a terrorist can buy weapons.\n  It makes no sense.\n  This bill offers Congress a clear choice: protect our homeland or \nprotect the gun lobby.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a summary of my bill, the Homeland \nSecurity Gun Safety Act, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              The Homeland Security Gun Safety Act of 2003\n\n       In the aftermath of the tragic events of September 11, \n     2001, the Federal Government has reassessed the Nation's \n     vulnerabilities to acts and threats of terrorism. However, \n     actions taken thus far have failed to address a major \n     remaining threat: accessibility to firearms and explosives \n     within our own borders. The Homeland Security Gun Safety Act \n     of 2003 addresses this threat that leaves America especially \n     vulnerable to future terrorist attacks.\n       The Act would enact specific measures that would help \n     prevent terrorists from acquiring firearms and explosives in \n     the United States. Specifically, the Act: 1. enacts increased \n     homeland security measures regarding firearm sales when the \n     terrorist risk level of the Homeland Security Advisory System \n     is raised to ``Elevated''; 2. closes loopholes that have \n     allowed rogue gun dealers to abuse existing law and supply \n     weapons to terrorists and criminals; and 3. strengthens the \n     enforcement of laws federally licensed gun dealers are \n     required to follow.\n       ``We have the responsibility to deny weapons to terrorists \n     and to actively prevent private citizens from providing \n     them.''--President George W. Bush, Address to the United \n     Nations, November 10, 2001.\n\n\n                    The Problem: Terrorism and Guns\n\n       There are a number of cases in which terrorists, both \n     domestic and international, have been acquiring firearms in \n     our country and are using them here and abroad for despicable \n     acts of violence. Firearms are being acquired by prohibited \n     persons due to the weakness and lack of enforceability of \n     existing gun laws.\n       Examples of the link between terrorism and firearms in the \n     U.S. include:\n       In December, 2001, a manual titled ``How I Can Train Myself \n     for Jihad'' was found among the rubble at a training facility \n     for a radical Pakistan-based Islamic terrorist organization \n     in Afghanistan. This manual contains an entire section on \n     ``Firearms Training'' and singles out the United States for \n     its easy availability of firearms. It stipulates that \n     terrorists living in the U.S. ``obtain an assault weapon \n     legally, preferably AK-47 or variations.'' It also advises \n     would-be terrorists on how they should conduct themselves in \n     order to avoid arousing suspicion as they amass and transport \n     firearms.\n       In November 2000, Ali Bourmelhem, was arrested for shipping \n     guns and ammunition to Hezbollah militants in Lebanon by \n     hiding the arms in cargo crates. Boumelhem, who was a \n     resident of Detroit and Beirut, was observed by authorities \n     traveling to gun shows to buy gun parts and ammunition for \n     shipment overseas. He was arrested just before he was \n     scheduled to travel to Lebanon.\n       In September 2000, Conor Claxton, an admitted member of the \n     IRA, bought dozens of handguns, rifles and rounds of high-\n     powered ammunition through illegal multiple sales and at gun \n     shows. Police in Northern Ireland intercepted 23 of the \n     packages which contained 122 guns and other weapons \n     originating from the group. Claxton's team enlisted the \n     assistance of a licensed firearms dealer in Florida who sold \n     at least 43 handguns to associates of Claxton. The dealer \n     agreed not to report all of the sales on required Federal \n     forms in exchange for an extra $50 per gun. The dealer \n     admitted that he suspected the guns could wind up in the \n     hands of assassins. The dealer later cooperated with \n     prosecutors and pleaded guilty to conspiring to export guns \n     illegally. According to the FBI Agent interviewing Claxton: \n     ``Claxton stated that it is common knowledge that obtaining \n     weapons in the United States is easy,'' and that ``Claxton \n     blamed the United States government for not having tougher \n     gun laws.''\n       In 1993, the owners of the Al Fajr Trading Company in \n     Atlanta were convicted of illegally shipping hundreds of guns \n     to Muslim street gangs and drug dealers in New York, Detroit \n     and Philadelphia. Among the customers was a gang associated \n     with Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman, the Egyptian cleric who was \n     involved in the 1993 terrorist bombing of the World Trade \n     Center. Al Fajr was a licensed dealer but intentionally \n     failed to maintain firearms transaction records of nearly \n     1,000 guns that were trafficked to the Northeast.\n       In 1992, an Iranian immigrant in the United States was shot \n     and killed execution style outside her home in Northern New \n     Jersey by a suspected Iranian terrorist. The gun was bought \n     at a Virginia gun shop that was preferred by straw \n     purchasers, high-volume buyers, gun traffickers and convicted \n     felons. The Virginia gun shop owners were arrested 2 months \n     prior to the murder and pleaded guilty to charges stemming \n     from straw purchases.\n       Cases of the use of firearms for terrorist acts include:\n       In 2002, John Muhammad and John Malvo terrorized the \n     Washington, DC area for more than 3 weeks by embarking on a \n     shooting spree with a sniper rifle. The weapon used to shoot \n     13 innocent victims was a Bushmaster XM-15 rifle purchased at \n     the Bull's Eye Shooter Supply in Tacoma, WA. Muhammad\n\n[[Page S5657]]\n\n     could not have legally purchased it because he is under a \n     domestic violence restraining order and Malvo at age 17 is \n     disqualified as a minor and an illegal immigrant. Two \n     employees of the store admitted that they noticed that the \n     .223 caliber Bushmaster was ``missing'' from a display case \n     but the store's owner did not report the loss as required by \n     Federal law. Following the sniper killings, the shop revealed \n     that over 200 guns went ``missing'' in the last several \n     years. Bull's Eye Shooter Supply remains in operation today.\n       In February 1997, Ali Abu Kamal opened fire on a crowd of \n     tourists at the Empire State Building, killing one person and \n     wounding six others. Kamal arrived in New York from Cairo on \n     a tourist visa. After a short stay in New York, he traveled \n     to Melbourne, FL where he checked into a motel. He showed the \n     motel receipt as proof of residency to obtain a Florida ID \n     card which he used to buy a 14-shot, semi-automatic Beretta \n     handgun. Total time from arrival in this country to purchase \n     of the gun was 37 days. The same gun store in Melbourne sold \n     a Ruger Mini 14 rifle to mass-murderer William Cruse a month \n     before he went on a shooting spree in Palm Bay, FL. Cruse \n     killed six people and wounded two dozen others.\n       ``[W]hen anyone uses a firearm, whether it's the kind of \n     terrorism that we are trying to combat with al Qaeda and \n     these non-state terrorists, or as a former district attorney \n     involved in the conviction of an individual who used firearms \n     against innocent citizens--regardless of how we define \n     terrorism, that individual and that family felt that they \n     were victims of a terrorist act. Brandishing a firearm in \n     front of anybody under any set of circumstances is a \n     terrorist act and needs to be dealt with.''--Tom Ridge, \n     January 17, 2003, at his confirmation hearing for Secretary \n     of Homeland Security, before the Senate Government Affairs \n     Committee.\n\n\n  confronting the threat: the homeland security gun safety act of 2003\n\n       The Homeland Security Gun Safety Act of 2003 integrates gun \n     safety into our national homeland security strategy. The bill \n     will suspend the current restrictions on law enforcement's \n     investigative powers during periods of ``Elevated'' terror \n     threat.\n       Currently, law enforcement is severely limited in its \n     ability to conduct background checks on suspicious gun \n     purchasers. While over 70 percent of background checks are \n     completed within seconds, and approximately 95 percent are \n     completed within 2 hours, red flags raised on some people's \n     records require further investigation. Under current law, law \n     enforcement only has 3 days to conduct a background check. \n     Given the complexity of tracing court records, the 3-day \n     period often does not give law enforcement enough time to \n     complete a check in some important cases. However, under \n     current law, after the 3-day period has expired, the firearm \n     is handed over to the purchaser--even if the person is a \n     convicted felon or part of a terrorist organization.\n       Under the Homeland Security Gun Safety Act, when the \n     Department of Homeland Security determines that the nation is \n     in an ``Elevated'' (yellow) risk of attack or above, the 3-\n     day rule would be suspended and law enforcement would have as \n     much time as needed to complete a background check on an \n     individual seeking a weapon or explosive. Upon reverting to a \n     ``Low,'' green, risk for a period of 180 consecutive days, \n     the 3-day rule would resume.\n       The Homeland Security Gun Safety Act would suspend this \n     record destruction rule, and require that all records of \n     firearms transfers subject to background checks and records \n     of the National Instant Criminal Background Check system be \n     maintained indefinitely when the Department of Homeland \n     Security determines that the nation is at an ``elevated,'' \n     yellow, risk of terrorist attack or above. Upon reverting to \n     a ``Low,'' green, risk for a period of 180 consecutive days, \n     the standard destruction of records rule resumes. This \n     information will be critical to investigators who are \n     tracking potential terrorists within our borders while we are \n     in a heightened state of alert.\n\n                Federal Firearms Dealer Responsibilities\n\n       The Homeland Security Gun Safety Act requires more \n     responsibility on the part of Federal Firearms Licensees; \n     FFLs; to prevent the flow of illegal firearms. Under the \n     current regime, rules gun dealers are ``required'' to follow \n     are routinely ignored, as the gun laws provide for little \n     enforcement, and even restrict the ability of law enforcement \n     to check gun dealer compliance. In addition, the current \n     system allows terrorists and criminals to travel from dealer \n     to dealer to attempt to purchase a gun until they ``score''--\n     without worrying about detection of their failed purchases. \n     The Homeland Security Gun Safety Act would close these \n     loopholes that allow rogue gun dealers to evade the law and \n     sell guns to criminals and terrorists. Specifically, the Act \n     would:\n       Require FFLs to report missing weapons immediately and \n     satisfy record keeping requirements, for multiple handgun \n     sales, theft or loss of firearm registration documents, trace \n     requests, out of business and demand records, or face \n     suspension of their licenses. As the ATF's ability to trace \n     crime guns depends on the records kept by FFLs, it is \n     imperative that FFLs fulfill their responsibility to timely \n     report missing weapons and relevant records.\n       Requires FFLs not to sell a firearm to an individual when \n     they have reasonable cause to believe that a gun will be used \n     in the commission of a crime.\n       If a FFL has reasonable cause to believe that a purchaser \n     is not buying a firearm for his or her own use, but intends \n     to transfer it to another individual who would not qualify \n     for a legal gun purchase, he or she will be prohibited from \n     making the transfer. This is commonly known as a ``straw \n     purchase'' and is a major problem in firearm trafficking in \n     the United States.\n       Require FFLs to abide by security standards for the storage \n     and display of firearms. According to the ATF, in 1998 and \n     1999, FFLs filed reports on over 27,287 missing or stolen \n     firearms. The Act would authorize suspensions and fines of \n     FFLs who fail to abide by security standards for the display \n     and storage of firearms.\n       Require FFLs to check all secondhand firearm purchases \n     through the FBI's Stolen Gun Registry to confirm that the \n     firearm was not stolen prior to the purchase.\n       Require that FFLs notify NICS immediately upon receiving a \n     request from a prospective transferee, of any check conducted \n     within the previous 30 days that did not result in the \n     transfer of a handgun.\n       Increase the number of permissible inspections of gun \n     dealers from one unannounced inspection per year, current \n     law, to an unlimited amount of inspections for any violation. \n     If a licensee has a poor compliance record, such as one of \n     the 1.2 percent of firearms dealers who account for 57 \n     percent of crime guns, multiple compliance inspections within \n     the 1-year period are necessary for adequate supervision.\n       Increase penalties for FFLs who fail to account for missing \n     weapons, fail to timely record or maintain records, record \n     keeping violations or knowingly make false statements in \n     connection with firearms from 1 year to 5 years and assess \n     fines up to $10,000 per violation. The current penalty for \n     this violation is a misdemeanor.\n       Prohibit any licensed firearms dealer from selling two or \n     more handguns to an unlicensed individual during any 30-day \n     period. This prohibition will be inapplicable to an exchange \n     of one handgun for one handgun.\n       Increase the penalties for persons who unlawfully transfer \n     handguns to juveniles from a misdemeanor to a felony.\n       Suspend a FFL's license if the licensee is charged with a \n     crime. Currently, a gun dealer can remain in operation if \n     charged with a crime.\n       Require the termination of a FFLs license upon a conviction \n     of a felony. Under current law, a licensee convicted of a \n     felony may continue to conduct business until appeal rights \n     are exhausted. This is a serious loophole which jeopardizes \n     public safety by allowing convicted felons to continue buying \n     and selling large quantities of firearms in interstate \n     commerce pending the resolution of their appeals.\n       Require criminal background checks of gun industry \n     employees who deal with firearms, including gun shops, \n     manufacturers and distributors.\n       Increase the penalty for persons who unlawfully transfer \n     firearms to a juvenile, from a misdemeanor to a felony.\n       Decrease the amount of black powder explosive one is able \n     to acquire without a permit from 50 pounds to 5 pounds.\n       According to the ATF report on Commerce in Firearms in the \n     United States, only 1.2 percent of Federal firearms \n     licensees--1,020 of the approximately 83,200 FFL retail \n     dealers--account for over half, 57 percent, of the crime guns \n     traced to current FFLs. This is a staggering number that \n     depicts the disregard of existing laws by these rogue gun \n     dealers. The Homeland and Security Gun Safety Act will \n     strengthen current regulatory control and enforcement in \n     order to protect the safety of the public, while allowing \n     law-abiding Americans to purchase firearms for their own use.\n       ``It's our position at the Justice Department and the \n     position of this Administration that we need to unleash every \n     possible tool in the fight against terrorism and do so \n     promptly.''--Attorney General John Ash- croft, Testimony \n     before Congress, September 24, 2001.\n       It is time we take a common sense approach to the terrorist \n     threats that face our country today. Terrorists are well \n     aware of our lax gun laws, and we must act preemptively to \n     prevent future tragedies.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to preserve \njobs and production activities in the United States; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, March marked the 32nd consecutive month, \nsince July 2000), that manufacturing employment has declined in the \nUnited States. This is the longest consecutive monthly decline in the \npost\n\n[[Page S5658]]\n\nWorld War II era. Already, more than 2 million manufacturing jobs are \ngone.\n  In South Carolina, we have seen a steady erosion of our manufacturing \njob base, and if we don't come up with new concepts to create and \nmaintain domestic manufacturing jobs, America will go out of business.\n  For all of 2002, industrial production fell 0.6 percent following a \n3.5 percent decline in 2001. That represented the first back-to-back \nannual declines in industrial output since 1974-1975.\n  Quite frankly, this is unacceptable.\n  We must act to save our manufacturing jobs. Earlier this Congress, I \nintroduced S. 592, the ``Save American Manufacturing Act of 2003,'' \nthat seeks to eliminate the tax incentives for off-shore production. \nToday, I introduce complementary legislation to provide tax incentives \nto produce in the United States.\n  The legislation I'm introducing today would provide tax benefits to \ndomestic producers. These tax incentives would become increasingly \nbeneficial as the percentage of manufacturing done in the United States \nincreases. Conversely, as the percentage of domestic production \ndecreases the incentives would also decrease.\n  This mechanism will provide a strong incentive for manufacturers to \nmaintain U.S. production and to return runaway production to the United \nStates.\n  Our communities, our industries and our workers are being harmed by \nthe erosion of our manufacturing base. Today's legislation is one \nadditional way that we can provide assistance to these vital groups.\n  This legislation is the companion to H.R. 1769 introduced earlier \nthis session in the House by Representatives Rangel and Crane.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 970\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Job Protection Act of \n     2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nprovide individuals with disabilities and older Americans with equal \naccess to community-based attendant services and supports, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today Senator Specter and I and others \nintroduce the Medicaid Community-Based Attendant Services and Supports \nAct of 2003, MICASSA. This legislation is needed to truly bring people \nwith disabilities into the mainstream of society and provide equal \nopportunity for employment and community activities.\n  In order to work or live in their own homes, Americans with \ndisabilities and older Americans need access to community-based \nservices and supports. Unfortunately, under current Federal Medicaid \npolicy, the deck is stacked in favor of living in an institution. The \npurpose of our bill is to level the playing field and give eligible \nindividuals equal access to community-based services and supports.\n  The Medicaid Community Attendant Services and Supports Act \naccomplishes four goals.\n  First, the bill amends Title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nprovide a new Medicaid plan benefit that would give individuals who are \ncurrently eligible for nursing home services or an intermediate care \nfacility for the mentally retarded equal access to community-based \nattendant services and supports.\n  Second, for a limited time, States would have the opportunity to \nreceive additional funds to support community attendant services and \nsupports and for certain administrative activities. Each State \ncurrently gets Federal money for their Medicaid program based on a set \npercentage. This percentage is the Medicaid match rate. This bill would \nincrease that percentage to provide some additional funding to States \nto help them reform their long term care systems.\n  Third, the bill provides States with financial assistance to support \n``real choice systems change initiatives'' that include specific action \nsteps to increase the provision of home and community based services.\n  Finally, the bill establishes a demonstration project to evaluate \nservice coordination and cost sharing approaches with respect to the \nprovision of services and supports for individuals with disabilities \nunder the age of 65 who are dually eligible for Medicaid and Medicare.\n  Some States have already recognized the benefits of home and \ncommunity based services. Every State offers certain services under \nhome and community based waiver programs, which serve a capped number \nof individuals with an array of home and community based services to \nmeet their needs and avoid institutionalization. Some States also are \nnow providing the personal care optional benefit through their Medicaid \nprogram.\n\n  However, despite this market progress, home and community based \nservices are unevenly distributed within and across states and only \nreach a small percentage of eligible individuals.\n  Those left behind are often needlessly institutionalize because they \ncannot access community alternatives. A person with a disability's \ncivil right to be integrated into his or her community should not \ndepend on his or her address. In Olmstead v. LC, the Supreme Court \nrecognized that needless institutionalization is a form of \ndiscrimination under the Americans With Disabilities Act. We in \nCongress have a responsibility to help States meet their obligations \nunder Olmstead.\n  This MICASSA legislation is designed to do just that and make the \npromise of the ADA a reality. It will help rebalance the current \nMedicaid long term care system, which spends a disproportionate amount \non institutional services. For example, in 2000, 49.5 billion dollars \nwere spent on institutional care, compared to 18.2 billion on community \nbased care. In the same year, only 3 States spent 50 percent or more of \ntheir long term care funds under the Medicaid program on home and \ncommunity based care.\n  And that means that individuals do not have equal access to community \nbased care throughout this country. An individual should not be asked \nto move to another state in order to avoid needless segregation. They \nalso should not be moved away from family and friends because their \nonly choice is an institution.\n  For example, I know a young man in Iowa, Ken Kendall, who is \ncurrently living in a nursing home because he cannot access home and \ncommunity based care. Ken was injured in a serious accident at the age \nof 17 and sustained a spinal chord injury. With the help of community \nbased services covered by his insurance company, Ken could live in his \nhome in Iowa City. Remaining independent made a tremendous difference \nin his life.\n  However, several years ago, Ken lost his health insurance and after a \ntime, he went onto Medicaid. As a Medicaid recipient, Ken was only \ngiven the option to live in a nursing home in Waterloo, almost two \nhours from his friends and family in Iowa City. In the nursing home, \nKen has become isolated. He is very far from his family and friends and \ndoes not have access to transportation. He has not been to a restaurant \nor a movie since he moved to the nursing home over two years ago. His \nlife has dramatically changed from when he lived in his own apartment \nand hired his own attendants to care for him. MICASSA would give him \nthat choice again--the choice to control his own life and live a full \nand meaningful life in his home community surrounded by his friends and \nfamily.\n  Federal Medicaid policy should reflect the consensus reached in the \nADA that Americans with Disabilities should have equal opportunity to \ncontribute to our communities and participate in our society as full \ncitizens. That means no one has to sacrifice their full participation \nin society because they need help getting out of the house in the \nmorning or assistance with personal care or some other basic service.\n  I am very pleased that the administration has included the Real \nChoice Systems Change grants in its budget this year at $40 million \ndollars. Senator Specter and I have supported these grants for several \nyears now. I also applaud the administration's commitment to The \nPresident's New Freedom Initiative for People with Disabilities and \nbelieve that this legislation helps promote the goals of that \ninitiative.\n  Community based attendant services and supports allow people with \ndisabilities to lead independent lives, have jobs, and participate in \nthe community. Some will become taxpayers, some will get an education, \nand some will participate in recreational and civic activities. But all \nwill experience a chance to make their own choices and govern their own \nlives.\n  This bill will open the door to full participation by people with \ndisabilities in our workplaces, our economy, and our American Dream, \nand I urge all my colleagues to support us on this issue. I want to \nthank Senator Specter for his leadership on this issue and his \ncommitment to improving access to home and community based services for \npeople with disabilities. I would also like to thank Senators Kennedy, \nCochran, Biden, Landrieu, Kerry, Corzine, Schumer, and Clinton for \njoining me in this important initiative.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 971\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Long-term services and supports provided under the \n     medicaid program established under title XIX of the Social \n     Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.) must meet the ability \n     and life choices of individuals with disabilities and older \n     Americans, including the choice to live in one's own home or \n     with one's own family and to become a productive member of \n     the community.\n       (2) Research on the provision of long-term services and \n     supports under the medicaid program (conducted by and on \n     behalf of the Department of Health and Human Services) has \n     revealed a significant funding bias toward institutional \n     care. Only about 27 percent of long term care funds expended \n     under the medicaid program, and only about 9 percent of all \n     funds expended under that program, pay for services and \n     supports in home and community-based settings.\n       (3) In the case of medicaid beneficiaries who need long \n     term care, the only long-term care service currently \n     guaranteed by Federal law in every State is nursing home \n     care. Only 27 States have adopted the benefit option of \n     providing personal care services under the medicaid program. \n     Although every State has chosen to provide certain services \n     under home and community-based waivers, these services are \n     unevenly available within and across States, and reach a \n     small percentage of eligible individuals. In fiscal year \n     2000, only 3 States spent 50 percent or more of their \n     medicaid long term care funds under the medicaid program on \n     home and community-based care.\n       (4) Despite the funding bias and the uneven distribution of \n     home and community-based services, 2\\1/2\\ times more people \n     are served in home and community-based settings than in \n     institutional settings.\n       (5) The goals of the Nation properly include providing \n     families of children with disabilities, working-age adults \n     with disabilities, and older Americans with--\n       (A) a meaningful choice of receiving long-term services and \n     supports in the most integrated setting appropriate to their \n     needs;\n       (B) the greatest possible control over the services \n     received and, therefore, their own lives and futures; and\n       (C) quality services that maximize independence in the home \n     and community, including in the workplace.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are the following:\n       (1) To reform the medicaid program established under title \n     XIX of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.) to \n     provide equal access to community-based attendant services \n     and supports.\n       (2) To provide financial assistance to States as they \n     reform their long-term care systems to provide comprehensive \n     statewide long-term services and supports, including \n     community-based attendant services and supports that provide \n     consumer choice and direction, in the most integrated setting \n     appropriate.\n\n            TITLE I--ESTABLISHMENT OF MEDICAID PLAN BENEFIT\n\n     SEC. 101.

Mr. President, I have sought recognition to join Senator \nTom Harkin, my colleague and distinguished ranking member of the \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services and \nEducation, which I chair, in introducing the ``Medicaid Attendant Care \nServices and Supports Act of 2003.'' This creative proposal addresses a \nglaring gap in Federal health coverage, and assists one of our Nation's \nmost vulnerable populations, persons with disabilities.\n  In an effort to improve the delivery of care and the comfort of those \nwith long-term disabilities, this vital legislation would allow for \nreimbursement for community-based attendant care services, in lieu of \ninstitutionalization, for eligible individuals who require such \nservices based on functional need, without regard to the individual's \nage or the nature of the disability. The most recent data available \ntell us that 58.5 million individuals receive care for disabilities \nunder the Medicaid program. The number of disabled who are not \ncurrently enrolled in the program who would apply for this improved \nbenefit is not easily counted, but would likely be substantial given \nthe preference of home and community-based care over institutional \ncare.\n  Under this proposal, States may apply for grants for assistance in \nimplementing ``systems change'' initiatives, in order to eliminate the \ninstitutional bias in their current policies and for needs assessment \nactivities. Further, if a state can show that the aggregate amounts of \nFederal expenditures on people living in the community exceeds what \nwould have been spent on the same people had they been in nursing \nhomes, the state can limit the program. No limiting mechanism is \nmandated under this bill, And finally, States would be required to \nmaintain expenditures for attendant care services under other Medicaid \ncommunity-based programs, thereby preventing the states from shifting \npatients into the new benefit proposed under this bill.\n\n  Let me speak briefly about why such a change in Medicaid law is so \ndesperately needed. In 1999 the Supreme Court held in Olmstead v. L.C., \n119 S. Ct. 2176 (1999), that the Americans with Disabilities Act, ADA, \nrequires States, under some circumstances, to provide community-based \ntreatment to persons with mental disabilities rather than placing them \nin institutions. This decision and several lower court decisions have \npointed to the need for a structured Medicaid attendant-care services \nbenefit in order to meet obligations under the ADA. Disability \nadvocates strongly support this legislation, arguing that the lack of \nMedicaid community-based services options is discriminatory and \nunhealthful for disabled individuals. Virtually every major disability \nadvocacy group supports this bill, including ADAPT, the Arc, the \nNational Council on Independent Living, Paralyzed Veterans of America, \nand the National Spinal Cord Injury Association.\n  Senator Harkin and I recognize that such a shift in the Medicaid \nprogram is a huge undertaking--but feel that it is a vitally important \none. We are introducing this legislation today in an attempt to move \nahead with the consideration of crucial disability legislation and to \nprovide a starting point for debate. The time has come for concerted \naction in this arena.\n  I urge the Congressional leadership, including the appropriate \ncommittee chairmen, to move forward in considering this legislation, \nand take the significant next step forward in achieving the objective \nof providing individuals with disabilities the freedom to live in their \nown communities.\n\n[[Page S5665]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COLEMAN:\n  S. 972.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Between 1933 and 1945, the Nazi regime and its \n     collaborators conducted systematic, bureaucratic, and State-\n     sponsored persecution and murder of approximately 6,000,000 \n     Jews--the genocidal act known as the Holocaust.\n       (2) Before and during World War II, millions of European \n     Jews purchased, in good faith, life insurance policies with \n     certain European insurance companies because these policies \n     were a popular form of savings and investment that provided a \n     means of safeguarding family assets, assisting in retirement \n     planning, providing for a dowry, or saving for the education \n     of children.\n       (3) After the Nazis came to power in Germany, they \n     systematically confiscated the insurance assets, including \n     the cash value of life insurance policies, of Jews and other \n     designated enemies of the Nazi regime.\n       (4) After the conclusion of World War II, European insurers \n     often rejected insurance claims of Holocaust victims and \n     heirs who lacked required documentation, such as death \n     certificates.\n       (5) During the 50 years since the end of the war, only a \n     small percentage of Holocaust victims and their families have \n     been successful in collecting on their policies.\n       (6) In 1998, the International Commission on Holocaust Era \n     Insurance Claims (ICHEIC) was established by State insurance \n     regulators in the United States, European insurers, and \n     certain nongovernmental organizations to act as a facilitator \n     between insurers and beneficiaries to help expedite payouts \n     on contested insurance policies.\n       (7) To date ICHEIC has received more than 90,000 claims and \n     has only made 2,281 settlement offers, which amounts to a \n     resolution rate of less than a 3 percent.\n       (8) These insurance payments should to be expedited to the \n     victims of the most heinous crime of the 20th Century to \n     ensure that they do not become victims a second time.\n       (9) States should be allowed to collect Holocaust-era \n     insurance information from foreign-based insurance companies \n     that want to do business in such States.\n       (10) Holocaust victims and their families should be able to \n     recover claims on Holocaust era insurance policies in Federal \n     court when they consider it necessary to seek redress through \n     the judicial system.\n\n     SEC. 3. STATE AUTHORITY TO ESTABLISH REQUIREMENTS FOR \n                   CONDUCTING INSURANCE BUSINESS.\n\n       (a) In General.--A State may establish requirements on \n     insurers as a condition of doing insurance business in that \n     State, to the extent such requirements are consistent with \n     the due process guarantees of the Constitution of the United \n     States, as follows:\n       (1) Information requirements.--The State may require that \n     an insurer provide to the State the following information \n     regarding Holocaust era insurance policies:\n       (A) Whether the insurer, or any affiliate or predecessor \n     company, sold any such policies.\n       (B) The number of such policies sold by the insurer, and \n     any affiliates and predecessor companies, and the number the \n     insurer and its affiliates currently have in their \n     possession.\n       (C) The identity of the holder and beneficiary of each such \n     policy sold or held and the current status of each such \n     policy.\n       (D) The city of origin, domicile, and address for each \n     policyholder listed.\n       (E) If an insurer has no such policies to report because \n     records are no longer in the possession of the insurer or its \n     affiliates, a statement explaining the reasons for the lack \n     of possession of such records.\n       (F) Any other information regarding such policies as the \n     State considers appropriate.\n       (2) Requirements regarding payment of policies.--A State \n     may require that an insurer certify that, with respect to any \n     Holocaust era insurance policies sold or at any time held by \n     the insurer--\n       (A) the proceeds of the policy were paid;\n       (B) the beneficiaries of the policy or heirs or such \n     beneficiaries could not, after diligent search, be located, \n     and the proceeds were distributed to Holocaust survivors or \n     charities;\n       (C) a court of law has certified a plan for the \n     distribution of the proceeds; or\n       (D) the proceeds have not been distributed.\n       (b) Holocaust Era Insurance Policies.--In this section, the \n     term ``Holocaust era insurance policy'' means a policy for \n     insurance coverage that--\n       (1) was in force at any time during the period beginning \n     with 1920 and ending with 1945; and\n       (2) has a policy beneficiary, policyholder, or insured life \n     that is a listed Holocaust victim.\n\n     SEC. 4. FEDERAL CAUSE OF ACTION FOR COVERED CLAIMS.\n\n       (a) Federal Cause of Action.--\n       (1) In general.--There shall exist a Federal cause of \n     action for any covered claim.\n       (2) Statute of limitations.--Any action brought under \n     paragraph (1) shall be filed not later than 10 years after \n     the date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (b) Subject Matter Jurisdiction.--The district courts shall \n     have original jurisdiction of any civil action on a covered \n     claim (whether brought under subsection (a) or otherwise).\n       (c) Personal Jurisdiction.--Notwithstanding any provision \n     of Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to the \n     contrary, in a civil action on a covered claim (whether \n     brought under subsection (a) or otherwise) commenced in a \n     district where the defendant is not a resident--\n       (1) the court may exercise jurisdiction over such defendant \n     on any basis not inconsistent with the Constitution of the \n     United States; and\n       (2) service of process, summons, and subpoena may be made \n     on such defendant in any manner not inconsistent with the \n     Constitution of the United States.\n       (d) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Covered claim.--The term ``covered claim'' means a \n     claim against a covered foreign insurance company that arises \n     out of the insurance coverage involved in an original \n     request.\n       (2) Original request.--The term ``original request'' means \n     a request that--\n       (A) seeks payment of any claim on insurance coverage that--\n       (i) was provided by a covered foreign insurance company;\n       (ii) had as the policyholder, insured, or beneficiary a \n     listed Holocaust victim; and\n       (iii) was in effect during any portion of the 13-year \n     period beginning with 1933 and ending with 1945; and\n       (B) was made by a listed Holocaust victim, or the heirs of \n     beneficiaries of such victim, to the covered foreign \n     insurance company or the International Commission on \n     Holocaust Era Insurance Claims.\n       (3) Covered foreign insurance company.--The term ``covered \n     foreign insurance company'' means each of the following \n     companies, and its affiliates and predecessor companies:\n       (A) Assicurazioni Generali S.p.A.\n       (B) Union Des Assurances de Paris.\n       (C) Victoria Lebenversicherungs AG.\n       (D) Winterthur Lebensversicherungs Gesellschaft.\n       (E) Allianz Lebensversicherungs AG.\n       (F) Wiener Allianz Versicherungs AG.\n       (G) Riunione Adriatica di Sicurta.\n       (H) Vereinte Lebensversicherungs AG.\n       (I) Basler Lebens-Versicherungs Gesellschaft.\n       (J) Deutscher Ring Lebensversicherungs AG.\n       (K) Nordstern Lebensversicherungs AG.\n       (L) Gerling Konzern Lebensversicherungs AG.\n       (M) Manheimer Lebensversicherung AG.\n       (N) Der Anker.\n       (O) Allgemeine Versicherungs AG.\n       (P) Zuerich Lebensversicherungs Gesellschaft.\n       (Q) Any other foreign insurance company that a State or the \n     Attorney General determines was in a position to have \n     financial dealings with any individual who was a victim of \n     the Holocaust.\n\n     SEC. 5. LISTED HOLOCAUST VICTIMS.\n\n       In this Act, the term ``listed Holocaust victim'' means the \n     following individuals:\n       (1) List of survivors.--Any individual whose name is on the \n     list of Jewish Holocaust Survivors maintained by the United \n     States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C.\n       (2) List of deceased.--Any individual whose name is on the \n     list of individuals who died in the Holocaust maintained by \n     the Yad Veshem of Jerusalem in its Hall of Names.\n       (3) Other lists.--Any individual whose name is on any list \n     of Holocaust victims that is designated as appropriate for \n     use under this Act by the chief executive officer of a State \n     or a State insurance commissioner or other principal \n     insurance regulatory authority of a State.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. NICKLES (for himself and Mr. Breaux):\n  S. 973. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na shorter recovery period for the depreciation of certain restaurant \nbuildings; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nprovide that restaurant buildings are depreciated over 15 years instead \nof the\n\n[[Page S5666]]\n\ncurrent-law 39 years. My legislation will ensure that the tax laws more \naccurately reflect the true economic life of restaurant buildings.\n  Under current law, real estate property and any improvements thereto \ngenerally must be depreciated over 39 years. However, restaurant \nbuildings undergo excessive wear and tear, and are renovated on average \nevery 6 to 8 years. Requiring restaurant owners to depreciate these \nrenovations over 39 years leads to a mismatch of income and expenses, \nthereby increasing the tax consequence of making such improvements. The \nlong depreciation period simply makes no economic sense.\n  In recent years, Congress has changed the depreciation schedules for \ncompetitors of owner-occupied restaurants. For example, convenience \nstores are depreciated over 15 years. In addition, leased properties, \nincluding leased restaurant space, can take advantage of the temporary \nbonus depreciation incentives contained in the 2001 economic stimulus \nbill.\n  I believe that our tax laws should be updated to treat restaurant \nproperty in a more rational manner. That is why I am introducing \nlegislation to reduce the depreciable life of restaurant property from \n39 years to 15 years. My legislation would ensure that all restaurants, \neither leased or owner-occupied, are treated equally. It would also \nensure a level playing field between restaurants and their competitors. \nBy reducing the time period over which all restaurants are depreciated, \nmy bill will more accurately align a restaurant's income and expenses. \nAccording to the National Restaurant Association, enacting this \nlegislation would generate an additional $3.7 billion in cash flow for \nrestaurants over the next 10 years. This is money that could be \nreinvested and, in turn, generate new jobs.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact my legislation \nthat will provide more rational tax-treatment of restaurants on a \npermanent basis. by doing so, we will take an incremental step toward \nmodernizing the tax code's outdated depreciation rules.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER (for himself and Mr. Santorum):\n  S. 974. A bill to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to \npermit certain youth to perform certain work with wood products; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to \nintroduce legislation designed to permit certain youths, those exempt \nfrom attending school, between the ages of 14 and 18 to work in \nsawmills under special safety conditions and close adult supervision. I \nintroduced identical measures in the past three Congresses. Similar \nlegislation introduced by my distinguished colleague, Representative \nJoseph R. Pitts, has already passed in the House in the 105th and 106th \nCongresses. I am hopeful the Senate will also enact this important \nissue.\n  As Chairman of the Labor, Health and Human Services and Education \nAppropriations Subcommittee, I have strongly supported increased \nfunding for the enforcement of the important child safety protections \ncontained in the Fair Labor Standards Act. I also believe, however, \nthat accommodation must be made for youths who are exempt from \ncompulsory school-attendance laws after the eighth grade. It is \nextremely important that youths who are exempt from attending school be \nprovided with access to jobs and apprenticeships in areas that offer \nemployment where they live.\n  The need for access to popular trades is demonstrated by the Amish \ncommunity. In 1998, I toured an Amish sawmill in Lancaster County, PA, \nand had the opportunity to meet with some of my Amish constituency. In \nDecember 2000, Representative Pitts and I held a meeting in Gap, PA \nwith over 20 members of the Amish community to hear their concerns on \nthis issue. On May 3, 2001, I chaired a hearing of the Labor, Health \nand Human Services and Education Appropriations Subcommittee to examine \nthese issues.\n  At the hearing the Amish explained that while they once made their \nliving almost entirely by farming, they have increasingly had to expand \ninto other occupations as farmland has disappeared in many areas due to \npressure from development. As a result, many of the Amish have come to \nrely more and more on work in sawmills to make their living. The Amish \nculture expects youth, upon the completion of their education at the \nage of 14, to begin to learn a trade that will enable them to become \nproductive members of society. In many areas, work in sawmills is one \nof the major occupations available for the Amish, whose belief system \nlimits the types of jobs they may hold. Unfortunately, these youths are \ncurrently prohibited by law from employment in this industry until they \nreach the age of 18. This prohibition threatens both the religion and \nlifestyle of the Amish.\n  Under my legislation, youths would not be allowed to operate power \nmachinery, but would be restricted to performing activities such as \nsweeping, stacking wood, and writing orders. My legislation requires \nthat the youths must be protected from wood particles or flying debris \nand wear protective equipment, all while under strict adult \nsupervision. The Department of Labor must monitor these safeguards to \ninsure that they are enforced.\n  The Department of Justice has raised serious concerns under the \nEstablishment Clause with the House legislation. The House measure \nconferred benefits only to a youth who is a ``member of a religious \nsect or division thereof whose established teachings do not permit \nformal education beyond the eighth grade.'' By conferring the \n``benefit'' of working in a sawmill only to the adherents of certain \nreligions, the Department argues that the bill appears to impermissibly \nfavor religion to ``irreligion.'' In drafting my legislation, I \nattempted to overcome such an objection by conferring permission to \nwork in sawmills to all youths who ``are exempted from compulsory \neducation laws after the eighth grade.'' Indeed, I think a broader \nfocus is necessary to create a sufficient range of vocational \nopportunities for all youth who are legally out of school and in need \nof vocational opportunities.\n  I also believe that the logic of the Supreme Court's 1972 decision in \nWisconsin v. Yoder supports my bill. In Yoder, the Court held that \nWisconsin's compulsory school attendance law requiring children to \nattend school until the age of 16 violated the Free Exercise Clause. \nThe Court found that the Wisconsin law imposed a substantial burden on \nthe free exercise of religion by the Amish since attending school \nbeyond the eighth grade ``contravenes the basic religious tenets and \npractices of the Amish faith.'' I believe a similar argument can be \nmade with respect to Amish youth working in sawmills. As their \npopulation grows and their subsistence through an agricultural way of \nlife decreases, trades such as sawmills become more and more crucial to \nthe continuation of their lifestyle. Barring youths from the sawmills \ndenies these youths the very vocational training and path to self-\nreliance that was central to the Yoder Court's holding that the Amish \ndo not need the final two years of public education.\n  I offer my legislation with the hope that my colleagues will work \nwith me to provide relief for the Amish community.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER (for himself and Mr. Santorum):\n  S. 975. A bill to revise eligibility requirements applicable to \nessential air service subsidies; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to \nintroduce legislation designed to improve the Department of \nTransportation's Essential Air Services program and reinstate \nLancaster, PA's eligibility to receive subsidized air service.\n  The Essential Air Services program provides operating subsidies to \nairlines, enabling them to serve smaller markets which would otherwise \nbe unable to attract or retain commercial flights. To be eligible to \nreceive such a subsidy, the community where the airport is located must \nbe greater than 70 miles from the nearest large or medium hub airport. \nIf the airport is located within 70 miles of a hub airport, the \nSecretary of Transportation may use his or her discretion to award a \nsubsidy if the most commonly used highway route between both places is \ngreater than 70 miles. It is up to the Department of Transportation to \ndetermine what route is used in making this mileage determination.\n\n[[Page S5667]]\n\n  Residents and businesses in many rural and smaller communities \nthroughout the United States rely heavily upon air service to provide a \nnecessary link to larger cities. Lancaster, PA is one such community \nwhich had been designated as an Essential Air Services city since the \nAirline Deregulation Act of 1978. Up until the events of September 11, \nwhen the Airport faced a sharp decline in passenger revenue, Lancaster \nhad never required a subsidy under this program.\n  When Lancaster ultimately found it necessary to seek a subsidy for \nits three daily flights to Pittsburgh, the Department of Transportation \nissued an Order to Show Cause on March 8, 2002, stating that Lancaster \nwas not eligible for an Essential Air Services subsidy because it was \nlocated within 70 miles of Philadelphia International Airport. The \nSecretary of Transportation declined to use his discretion to award the \nsubsidy because the Department identified a driving route of less than \n70 miles between Lancaster City and Philadelphia Airport. While there \nis no question that such a route exists, it is by no means the most \ncommonly used highway route as required by law.\n  The route selected by the Department of Transportation is one which \nthe average person would never travel, via back roads and seldom used \nstreets. In making its distance determination, the Department used a 66 \nmile route along Route 30 which would take over three hours to drive. \nThe more commonly used highway route to the Philadelphia International \nAirport would be along US 222 to the Pennsylvania Turnpike, and then on \nto I-76, which is over 70 miles.\n  The legislation I am introducing today addresses this issue by \ndesignating an area's local metropolitan planning organization, rather \nthan the Department of Transportation, as the organization responsible \nfor determining the most commonly used highway route. If no such \norganization exists, the Governor of the State in which the airport is \nlocated, or the Governor's designee will make the determination. I \nbelieve that a local entity, not the Department of Transportation, is \nbetter suited to identify the route most travelers would drive. In such \ncases where that route exceeds 70 miles, the Department should be \nrequired to designate a community as eligible to receive subsidized air \nservice.\n  My legislation will not place too great a burden upon the Essential \nAir Services program by allowing additional airports to participate. I \nam advised that there are only eight other communities, including \nLancaster, which could become newly eligible to receive subsidized air \nservice as a result of the changes I am proposing. Further, I would \nnote that of the $113 million the program received in Fiscal Year 2002, \nthere was an excess of $10.9 million which remained unspent and which \ncarried over into Fiscal Year 2003.\n  Lancaster Airport's only commercial air carrier, Colgan Air, ceased \noperations on March 23, 2003, because it could not sustain service \nwithout a subsidy. The loss of commercial air service has already had a \nserious impact upon the Lancaster community. I am confident that my \nlegislation will not only reinstate Lancaster's eligibility for \nsubsidized air service and allow for the return of commercial air \nservice, but it will also provide for a greater level of fairness for \nother communities which rely so heavily upon this important program.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WARNER (for himself and Mr. Allen):\n  S. 976. A bill to provide for the issuance of a coin to commemorate \nthe 400th anniversary of the Jamestown settlement; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation, \nalong with my colleague, Senator Allen, to mint a commemorative coin \ncelebrating the 400th anniversary of the founding of Jamestown, VA in \n2007.\n  The lasting significance of Jamestown stretches far beyond its \ncontributions to the Commonwealth of Virginia. Our Nation is indebted \nto the 104 original inhabitants of Jamestown who, after completing a \nharrowing journey across the Atlantic in May of 1607, established the \nfirst permanent English settlement in America.\n  The legacies of Jamestown extend from the founding of our \nrepresentative democracy in which we serve today, to the free market \nenterprise system on which our economy has flourished. Our unshakeable \ntraditions of common law, agricultural production, manufacturing, and \nour free market economy received their humble beginnings from the \nentrepreneurial spirit of the Jamestown colonists.\n  The colonists established and implemented the principles of a \nrepresentative government to build our American democracy that has \nwithstood the test of time and internal conflict. The Jamestown \nsettlers elected America's first democratic assembly, the Virginia \nHouse of Burgesses. The structure and procedures of this first \nlegislative body still resonates in the chamber we serve in today. Our \npolitical philosophies and traditions took hold in the untamed \nlandscape of Jamestown Island and remain the cornerstone of our \nrepublic today.\n  Jamestown also marked the beginning of the American cultural \nidentity, hosting a combination of diverse cultural traditions. The \nsettlement united English, Native American, and African cultures \ncompelling each one to learn valuable lessons from the others. The \ncolonists at Jamestown were the first immigrants to travel to America, \nmaking us a nation of immigrants of which we are so proud today.\n  The colony at Jamestown showcased the triumph of American ingenuity \nand hard work. Colonists at Jamestown were forced to battle starvation, \ndisease, and the weather of their new home. Life in Jamestown was a \nstruggle, and the determination shown by the colonists set the \nfoundation for the revolutionary ideas that guided Americans through \nthe colonial era.\n  Now 395 years later, the history of our Nation continues to come \nalive in Jamestown. Since 1994, archaeologists have found the remains \nof the original Jamestown fort constructed in 1607 and over 350,000 \nartifacts from the colonial period. These fascinating discoveries have \ngiven scholars, visitors, and most importantly, America's young people, \na realistic view of 17th century American life. The continuing \nrestoration and discovery of the original Jamestown colony provides all \nAmericans with a window on their roots, and to the foundation on which \nthis great Nation was built.\n  The proceeds from this commemorative coin will help both the National \nPark Service and the Association for the Preservation of Virginia \nAntiquities continue their research at the Jamestown site, complete \nnecessary construction projects at the Jamestown National Park, and \nprovide funds for events surrounding the 400th anniversary celebration. \nIn addition, this legislation would help ensure that the Jamestown \nRediscovery project will have adequate funds to continue educating the \nAmerican public on our colonial history. In the 106th Congress, the \nHouse and Senate created the Jamestown 400th Commemoration Commission \nto ensure that the anniversary in 2007 is a truly national event. This \nlegislation that I introduce today continues along this same line.\n  Recent events have brought about a renewed reverence and interest in \nour nation's history among the American people. This legislation would \nhelp bring national attention to this important anniversary and would \nserve as a fitting tribute to America's first permanent settlers. This \nevent celebrates America's colonial history and gives every American a \nchance to help support America's Hometown, Jamestown, VA.\n  I ask my colleagues in the Senate to join me in supporting our \nNation's and Virginia's colonial traditions with this important \nlegislation. I ask unanimous consent that the text of this legislation \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 976\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act, the Employee \nRetirement Income Security Act of 1974, and the Internal Revenue Code \nof 1986 to require that group and individual health insurance coverage \nand group health plans provide coverage from treatment of a minor \nchild's congenital or developmental deformity or disorder due to \ntrauma, infection, tumor, or disease; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nChildren's Deformities Act of 2003, which will require insurance \ncompanies to cover corrective surgeries for children with congenital or \ndevelopmental deformities.\n  According to the March of Dimes, 3.8 percent of babies born \nannually--about 150,000 babies per year suffer from birth defects. \nApproximately 50,000 of these babies require reconstructive surgery. \nExamples of these deformities include cleft lip, cleft palate, skin \nlesions, vascular anomalies, malformations of the ear, hand, or foot, \nand other more profound craniofacial deformities.\n  Plastic surgeons are able to correct many of these problems, and \ndoing so is critical to both the physical and mental health and \ndevelopment of the child. On average, children with congenital \ndeformities or developmental anomalies will need three to five surgical \nprocedures before normalcy is achieved. An increasing number of \ninsurance companies are denying access\n\n[[Page S5669]]\n\nto care by labeling the surgical procedures cosmetic or nonfunctional \nin nature. In some cases, carriers may provide coverage for initial \nprocedures, but resist covering later, necessary procedures, claiming \nthat they are cosmetic and not medically necessary.\n  Although insurance companies ultimately have decided to cover some of \nthese procedures, families have had to battle through the appeals \nprocess of insurance companies for extended periods of time, thereby \nforcing children to wait unnecessarily for needed surgeries. The \ntreatment plan for children with congenital defects usually requires \nstaged surgical care in accordance with the child's growth pattern. \nOnerous and time-consuming appeals procedures can jeopardize the \nphysical and psychological health of children with deformities.\n  The American Medical Association defines cosmetic surgery as being \nperformed to reshape normal structures of the body in order to improve \nthe patient's appearance and self-esteem. In contrast, reconstructive \nsurgery is defined as being performed on abnormal structures of the \nbody, caused by congenital defects, developmental abnormalities, \ntrauma, infection, tumors, or disease. According to the American \nSociety of Plastic Surgeons, reconstructive surgery is performed in \norder to improve function and approximate a normal appearance.\n  The Treatment of Children's Deformities Act of 2003 will prohibit \ninsurers from denying coverage for reconstructive surgery for children. \nThis bill identifies the difference between cosmetic and reconstructive \nsurgery and incorporates the American Medical Association's definition \nof reconstructive surgery. The measure requires group and individual \nhealth insurers and group health plans to provide coverage for \ntreatment of a minor child's congenital or developmental deformity, \ndisease, or injury. The legislation defines ``treatment'' to include \nreconstructive surgical procedures. These are procedures that are \nperformed on abnormal structures of the body caused by congenital \ndefects, developmental abnormalities, trauma, infection, tumors, or \ndisease.\n  The Treatment of Children's Deformities Act of 2003 has been endorsed \nby the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, the American Medical \nAssociation, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and several other \nmedical organizations. Fifteen States have already enacted legislation \nthat to different degrees require insurance companies to cover \ntreatment of craniofacial and congenital anomalies. While governor of \nTexas, George W. Bush signed into law legislation that is similar to \nthe legislation I introduce today.\n  I would like to thank Senator Kennedy and Senator Snowe for \ncosponsoring this important legislation. I urge all of my colleagues to \njoin me in supporting this bill so that children who suffer from \ncongenital deformities or developmental anomalies do not have to wait \nunnecessarily for needed treatment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record \nfollowing the conclusion of my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 977\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, it is a privilege to join Senator \nFitizgerald and Senator Snowe in introducing the Treatment of \nChildren's Deformities Act. The purpose of our bill is to see that \nhealth insurers and health plans cover the treatment of children's \ncongenital and developmental deformities and disorders.\n  About 7 percent of all children are born with significant problems, \nincluding cleft lips or cleft palates, serious skin lesions such as \nport wine stains, malformations of the ear, or facial deformities. \nPlastic surgery can correct many of these conditions, but too often \nparents face significant barriers in obtaining care for their children. \nMore than half of all plastic surgeons report that these patients are \ndenied insurance coverage or had the struggle to receive it. Too often, \ninsurers deny coverage by calling the treatment cosmetic or not \nmedically necessary.\n  The medical, developmental, and psychological problems associated \nwith denied or delayed treatment of these deformities are enormous. \nTreatment often requires a series of treatments as the child grow. No \nchild should be forced to live with an untreated cleft lip or a facial \ndeformity while parents appeal an insurer's unfair denial. Delayed or \ndenied treatment puts a child's physical and mental health at risk.\n  Our bill requires health insurers and health plans to provide \ncoverage to treat a child's congenial or developmental deformity, or \ndisorders caused by disease, trauma, infection, or tumor. It is \nsupported by many medical organizations, including the American Academy \nof Pediatrics, the American Medical Association, and the American \nSociety of Plastic Surgeons. I urge the Senate to support this \nimportant bill, and give children and families the support they \ndeserve.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ENSIGN (for himself, Mrs. Boxer, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Crapo, \n        Mr. Craig, Mr. Allen, Mrs. Murray, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Reid, \n        Mr. Allard, Mr. Burns, Mr. Warner, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Smith, Ms. \n        Stabenow, and Mr. Coleman):\n  S. 979. A bill to direct the Securities and Exchange Commission to \nrequire enhanced disclosures of employee stock options, to require a \nstudy on the economic impact of broad-based employee stock options \nplans, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, \nand Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise today, along with my good friend, \nthe junior Senator from California, to introduce legislation on an \nissue that could have a significant impact on the economy.\n  The financial scandals which occurred last year at Enron, WorldCom, \nand other corporations rocked our financial markets and greatly \ndiminished investor confidence in this country. In response to abuses \nby a few high-profile corporate executives, Congress passed the \nSarbanes-Oxley Corporate Responsibility Act, which closed loopholes \nthat led to those scandals and sought to restore investor confidence in \nour markets.\n  However, in the wake of those scandals, I believe that stock options \nhave been incorrectly equated with abuse.\n  Stock option plans reflect America's best business values--the \nwillingness to take risks, the vision to develop new entrepreneurial \ncompanies and technologies, and a way to broaden ownership and \nparticipation among all employees.\n  Last week, the Financial Accounting Standards Board made a tentative \ndecision to mandate the expensing of stock options. This would \neffectively kill broad-based stock option plans which are used by many \nhigh-growth, entrepreneurial companies. Such board-based plans \ndistribute options to rank-and-file employees, not just to senior \nexecutives. This is a very different approach than that used by \ncompanies associated with the scandals of last year.\n  This issue was brought to my attention by a couple hundred chief \nexecutive officers and leaders in the high-tech world. This is their \nNo. 1 issue because, when they are properly structured, stock options \nare valuable incentives for productivity and growth. They also help \nstartup companies recruit and retain workers--an essential tool in a \nstruggling economy.\n  I think it is absolutely ludicrous that we would risk destroying \ngrowth when there isn't even a workable model available to accurately \nexpense stock options. Not only is the plan wrong, it is not doable.\n  The legislation that we are introducing today would provide \nshareholders with accurate information\n\n[[Page S5671]]\n\nabout a company's use of stock options, while also preserving this \ncritical tool for all company employees. It would enhance the \navailability of financial reporting by requiring the SEC to take very \nspecific steps to give shareholders and investors the important \nfinancial information they need.\n  Additionally, this bill places a 3-year moratorium on the mandatory \nexpensing of stock options. This will allow the Department of Commerce \nto take a very detailed look at the negative impact that mandating \nexpensing of stock options could have on our economy.\n  It is important that we do not react to the corporate scandals of \nlast year by stifling this vital tool for economic growth. It would be \nbad for the economy, bad for workers in this country, and bad for \npotential investors.\n  Mr. President, before I yield the floor, I would like to thank the \nSenator from California, Mrs. Boxer, for her hard work on this issue. I \nwould also like to recognize and thank my colleagues who have signed on \nin support of this bill, Senators George Allen, Mike Crapo, Larry \nCraig, Maria Cantwell, Patty Murray, Dianne Feinstein, Harry Reid, \nWayne Allard, Conrad Burns, Gordon Smith, Robert Bennett and John \nWarner.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord in the appropriate place.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 979\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n        This Act may be cited as the ``Broad-Based Stock Option \n     Plan Transparency Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n\n        Congress finds that--\n       (1) innovation and entrepreneurship, particularly in the \n     high technology industry, helped propel the economic growth \n     of the 1990s, and will continue to be the essential building \n     blocks of economic growth in the 21st century;\n       (2) broad-based employee stock option plans enable \n     entrepreneurs and corporations to attract quality workers, to \n     incentivize worker innovation, and to stimulate productivity, \n     which in turn increase shareholder value;\n       (3) broad-based employee stock options plans that expand \n     corporate ownership to rank-and-file employees spur capital \n     formation, benefit workers, and improve corporate performance \n     to the benefit of investors and the economy;\n       (4) concerns raised about the impact of employee stock \n     option plans on shareholder value raise legitimate issues \n     relevant to the current level of disclosure and transparency \n     of those plans to current and potential investors; and\n       (5) investors deserve to have accurate, reliable, and \n     meaningful information about the existence of outstanding \n     employee stock options and their impact on the share value of \n     a going concern.\n\n     SEC. 3. IMPROVED EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION TRANSPARENCY AND \n                   REPORTING DISCLOSURES.\n\n       (a) Enhanced Disclosures Required.--Not later than 180 days \n     after the date of enactment of this Act, the Securities and \n     Exchange Commission (in this Act referred to as the \n     ``Commission'') shall, by rule, require, for each company \n     required to file periodic reports under section 13(a) or \n     15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78m, \n     78o(d)), that such reports include detailed information \n     regarding stock option plans, stock purchase plans, and other \n     arrangements involving an employee acquisition of an equity \n     interest in the company, particularly with respect to the \n     dilutive effect of such plans, including--\n       (1) a discussion, written in ``plain English'' (in \n     accordance with the Plain English Handbook published by the \n     Office of Investor Education and Assistance of the \n     Commission), of the dilutive effect of stock option plans, \n     including tables or graphic illustrations of such dilutive \n     effects;\n       (2) expanded disclosure of the dilutive effect of employee \n     stock options on the earnings per share number of the \n     company;\n       (3) prominent placement and increased comparability of all \n     stock option related information; and\n       (4) a summary of the stock options granted to the 5 most \n     highly compensated executive officers of the company, \n     including any outstanding stock options of those officers.\n       (b) Equity Interest.--As used in this section, the term \n     ``equity interest'' includes common stock, preferred stock, \n     stock appreciation rights, phantom stock, and any other \n     security that replicates the investment characteristics of \n     such securities, and any right or option to acquire any such \n     security.\n\n     SEC. 4. EVALUATION OF EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION PLANS \n                   TRANSPARENCY AND REPORTING DISCLOSURES AND \n                   REPORT TO CONGRESS.\n\n       (a) Study and Report.--\n       (1) Study.--During the 3-year period following the date of \n     issuance of a final rule under section 3(a), the Commission \n     shall conduct a study of the effectiveness of the enhanced \n     disclosures required by section 3 in increasing transparency \n     to current and potential investors.\n       (2) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the end of the \n     3-year period referred to in paragraph (1), the Commission \n     shall transmit a report of the results of the study conducted \n     under paragraph (1) to the Committee on Financial Services of \n     the House of Representatives and the Committee on Banking, \n     Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate.\n       (b) Moratorium on New Accounting Standards Related to Stock \n     Options.--During the period beginning on the date of \n     enactment of this Act and ending 60 days after the date of \n     transmission of the report required under subsection (a)(2), \n     the Commission shall not recognize as generally accepted \n     accounting principles for purposes of enforcing the \n     securities laws any accounting standards related to the \n     treatment of stock options that the Commission did not \n     recognize for that purpose before April 1, 2003.\n\n     SEC. 5. STUDY ON THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF BROAD-BASED EMPLOYEE \n                   STOCK OPTION PLANS AND REPORT TO CONGRESS.\n\n       (a) Study.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary of Commerce shall conduct a \n     study and analysis of broad-based employee stock option \n     plans, particularly in the high technology and any other high \n     growth industries.\n       (2) Content.--The study and analysis required by paragraph \n     (1) shall include an examination of--\n       (A) the impact of such plans on expanding employee \n     corporate ownership to workers at a wide-range of income \n     levels, with a particular focus on rank-and-file employees;\n       (B) the role of such plans in the recruitment and retention \n     of skilled workers; and\n       (C) the role of such plans in stimulating research and \n     innovation;\n       (D) the impact of such plans on the economic growth of the \n     United States; and\n       (E) the role of such plans in strengthening the \n     international competitiveness of companies organized under \n     the laws of the United States.\n       (b) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Commerce shall submit \n     a report on the study and analysis required by subsection (a) \n     to--\n       (1) the Committee on Energy and Commerce and the Committee \n     on Financial Services of the House of Representatives; and\n       (2) the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation \n     and the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of \n     the Senate.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of legislation \nintroduced by Senators Boxer and Ensign to improve disclosure of stock \noption grants in company financial statements while, at the same time, \ndelaying the adoption of new accounting standards that could \nfundamentally distort reported earnings.\n  I believe that at this time of continued economic weakness it is \ncritical that we take action to both increase transparency and improve \ncorporate governance, without which we cannot hope to restore investor \nconfidence.\n  The Broad-Based Stock Option Plan Transparency Act would increase the \ntransparency of stock option grants at all levels of public companies, \nparticularly executive compensation, and would provide investors with \nadditional tools to make investment decisions.\n  Increased disclosure provisions in the bill include: expanded \ndisclosure of the dilutive effect of employee stock options on reported \nearnings per share; a ``plain English'' discussion of share value \ndilution, which would allow individual investors to understand the \nimpact of options grants on their investment; more prominent placement \nand increased comparability of stock option-related footnotes; and a \nsummary of stock options granted to the 5 most highly compensated \nexecutives of the company.\n  These provisions help us fulfill the goal of greater transparency in \nour markets and improved corporate governance. With passage of the \nSarbanes-Oxley accounting reform legislation last summer, we took a \nmajor step in that direction, and I believe this bill adds to those \nachievements.\n  If individual investors do not feel comfortable with the information \nreported by public companies or the advice given by banks and other \nmajor players in our financial markets, they will not feel comfortable \nmaking new investments and our markets are unlikely to recover.\n  In addition to requiring new disclosure of the impact of employee \nstock options on a company's earnings per share, this bill also \nrequires the SEC to\n\n[[Page S5672]]\n\nmonitor the effectiveness of increased disclosure requirements for 3 \nyears.\n  The bill also specifies that the SEC must examine the impact of \nbroad-based stock option plans on worker productivity and the \nperformance of the firms which use such plans.\n  As anyone who has spent time in Silicon Valley can attest, the \nphenomenal achievements of high tech companies in California and across \nthe country would not have been possible without employee stock \noptions.\n  Stock options give employees a stake in the success of their company \nand create a degree of employee loyalty, productivity, and achievement \nthat simply would not be possible if cash were the only form of \ncompensation available. Moreover, it has allowed start-ups that are \ncash-poor to hire and retain talent that might otherwise have been \navailable only to established firms.\n  A mandatory expensing standard will sharply limit the use of stock \noptions, particularly for rank and file workers, and will slow our \neconomic recovery.\n  Without a strong high tech sector developing new technologies and \nbringing new products to market, we cannot hope to return to the robust \neconomic growth of the last decade.\n  Moreover, mandatory expensing could actually decrease transparency \nfor the average investor. The Financial Accounting Standards Board \n(FASB) has indicated it will implement such a rule within the next \nyear, but has not come up with an adequate means of valuing those \noptions for expensing purposes.\n  The binomial pricing model currently used to value short-term \nderivatives, also known as Black/Scholes, does not work with the types \nof long-term, restricted options packages granted to employees. Without \nan accurate valuation methodology, we risk giving investors a much less \naccurate picture of a company's financial health than they would have \notherwise.\n  I have spoken with the chief executive officers of a number of \ncompanies in my state, including John Chambers, CEO of Cisco Systems, \nCraig Barrett, CEO of Intel, and Richard Kovacevich, CEO of Wells \nFargo. Each one of those corporate leaders has told me that a mandatory \nexpensing standard would lead them to sharply limit the number of \noptions he grants to his employees.\n  They also told me that it would lead them cut back on hiring and \npossibly send more jobs abroad. I found those comments disturbing, and \nthey should give us pause and compel us to act prudently. That is why \nwe should support further study of the accounting treatment of stock \noptions, during which period no new accounting rules pertaining tot \nstock options could be adopted.\n  I would like to describe briefly the impact of employee stock options \non the value of an investor's holdings in the company that granted the \noption.\n  In order for employee stock options not to be counted as an expense, \nthey must be set at or above the average closing price of the company's \nstock during a fixed period. They are also generally restricted, and \nusually cannot be exercised for several years after their grant date.\n  Should the value of the underlying shares fall during the life of the \noption, the options are underwater and are effectively worthless. \nShould the share price increase, however, the exercise of those options \ncreates no cash charge to the company whatsoever. Instead, it increases \nthe total number of shares outstanding.\n  To take one concrete example, Cisco Systems recently reported \napproximately 7.3 billion shares outstanding in their latest annual \nreport. They also reported approximately 600 million options to \npurchase shares that were ``in the money,'' or had an exercise price \nbelow the current share price.\n  If all those options were exercised, and no shares were repurchased, \neach share would be entitled to approximately 8 percent less in \ndividends than before. In fact, the actual dilution would likely be \nsomewhat less.\n  If options are expensed, however, the impact on Cisco's bottom line \nwould be dramatic, despite the fact that their only tangible impact is \non the number of shares outstanding. Had Cisco expensed their stock \noptions for the 2001 fiscal year, their reported profits would have \nbeen 171 percent lower. A roughly $1 billion profit would instead have \nbeen a nearly $1 billion loss.\n  Yet the actual value of those options now is almost nil. They were \nall granted at exercise prices well above the current share price, and \nmay never be exercised.\n  Options are not a cash expense and represent no tangible exchange of \nassets. They are a form of incentive pay that may ultimately be \nworthless. In short, they are nothing like a cash salary.\n  The legislation introduced by Senators Boxer and Ensign recognizes \nthe need for further study, but does not place an indefinite moratorium \non FASB action. It is a balanced bill that will help the average \ninvestor and ultimately strengthen our financial markets.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Broad-Based Stock Option \nTransparency Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina (for himself and Mr. Miller):\n  S. 980.

A bill to limit the period for which the Federal Government \nmay procure property or services using noncompetitive procedures during \nemergency and urgent situations; to the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation is to \nensure that American taxpayers and American businesses are protected \nwhen the Federal Government procures property or services.\n  The purpose of this legislation is to close certain loopholes that \nallow Federal agencies to enter into contracts through a process that \ndoes not ensure full and open competition. Current law provides several \nexceptions that allow Federal agencies to limit competition or provide \na sole-source contract. My legislation does not eliminate any of these \nexceptions, but it does place a 90-day limitation on the broadest \nexceptions to ensure that a full and fair bidding process takes place \nas soon as possible.\n  This bill does not extend the 90-day limitation on sole-source or \nlimited-source contracts when full and open competition is not \npracticable. For example, the legislation will continue to allow sole-\nsource or limited-source contracts when there is a threat to the \nnational security of the United States or when the property or service \nis only available from one party.\n  But we must take a common-sense approach to shield taxpayers from \nwaste and abuse. This bill does just that. I have heard from people \nthroughout my state who believe that the administration is abusing its \nauthority in providing sole-source and limited-source contacts in Iraq.\n  One example is the sole-source contract worth up to $7 billion that \nwas awarded earlier this year to Kellogg, Brown and Root--a subsidiary \nof Halliburton--to extinguish oil fires in Iraq. The exception under \nFederal law used to provide KBR with the sole-source contract was that \na full and open bid process would cause unacceptable delays. While it \nis understandable that oil fires cannot be allowed to burn while an \nopen bid process takes place, it is not acceptable that the term of \nthis contract was 2 years.\n  Recently, the administration announced that this contract would be \nterminated and an open bid process take place. While I applaud this \nmove, I fear it would not have happened without the outcry of the \nAmerican people. My legislation will ensure that certain sole-source \ncontracts will be limited to 90 days. During the 90-day period, a full \nand open competition would take place so that the long-term contract is \nawarded to the qualified low-bidder.\n  It is the responsibility of Congress to ensure that these contracts \nare awarded in a competitive manner whenever possible. This legislation \nis a step in the right direction.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 981\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Business and Taxpayer \n     Procurement Protection Act.''\n\n     SECTION 2. LIMITATION ON CONTRACTS AWARDED ON A \n                   NONCOMPETITIVE BASIS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law \n     or regulation, including the Federal Property and \n     Administrative Services Act of 1949, section 2304 of title \n     10, United States Code, and the Federal Acquisition \n     Regulation--\n       (1) any procurement for property or services that is not \n     subject to competitive procedures under a provision of law or \n     regulation set forth in subsection (b) may not exceed 90 \n     days; and\n       (2) if any property or services procured under the \n     limitations of paragraph (1) are required beyond the 90 days \n     referred to in paragraph (1), such property or services \n     shall--\n       (A) during the 90-day period, be the subject of a full and \n     open competition in accordance with the appropriate law or \n     regulation; and\n       (B) shall not be procured using procedures other than \n     competitive procedures under a provision of law or regulation \n     set forth in subsection (b).\n\n[[Page S5674]]\n\n       (b) Applicability.--The provisions of law and regulations \n     referred to in subsection (a) are the following:\n       (1) Subsections (c)(2), (c)(3)(A), (c)(7), and \n     (d)(1)(B)(ii) of section 303 of the Federal Property and \n     Administrative Services Act of 1949 (41 U.S.C. 253).\n       (2) Subsections (c)(2), (c)(3)(A), (c)(7), and \n     (d)(1)(B)(ii) of section 2304 of title 10, United States \n     Code.\n       (3) Any other provision of law or regulation that provides \n     for the use of noncompetitive procedures for the same or a \n     similar reason as those referred to in clauses (1) and (2).\n\n     SECTION 3. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This Act shall apply with respect to contracts entered into \n     after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER (for herself and Mr. Santorum):\n  S. 982. A bill to halt Syrian support for terrorism, end its \noccupation of Lebanon, stop its development of weapons of mass \ndestruction, cease its illegal importation of Iraqi oil, and hold Syria \naccountable for its role in the Middle East, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing the Syria \nAccountability Act, a bill that aims to end Syrian support for \nterrorism by diplomatic and economic means.\n  It is well known that terrorist organizations like Hizballah, Hamas, \nand the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine maintain offices, \ntraining camps, and other facilities on Syrian territory and in areas \nof Lebanon occupied by the Syrian armed forces. We must address this \nissue not with saber rattling but by confronting the Government of \nSyria in a diplomatic way that shows the seriousness of our concerns.\n  The Syria Accountability Act works to achieve our foreign policy \ngoals by expanding economic and diplomatic sanctions against Syria \nuntil the President certifies that Syria has ended its support of \nterrorism, withdrawn from Lebanon, ceased its chemical and biological \nweapons program, and no longer illegally imports Iraqi oil. The bill \nprovides flexibility to the President by allowing him to choose from a \nvariety of sanctions, as well as the authority to waive sanctions if it \nis in the interest of United States national security.\n  I hope this legislation will receive the support of the \nAdministration and Congress because it provides the President with the \nflexibility to target specific sanctions against Syria, but in no way \nthreatens or condones the use of military force against Syria.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CHAFEE (for himself, Mr. Reid, Mr. Hatch, Ms. Mikulski, \n        Ms. Collins, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Warner, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Voinovich, \n        Mr. Biden, Mr. Allen, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Fitzgerald, Mrs. \n        Murray, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Feingold, Mrs. Feinstein, \n        Mr. Reed, and Mr. Corzine):\n  S. 983. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to authorize \nthe Director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences \nto make grants for the development and operation of research centers \nregarding environmental factors that may be related to the etiology of \nbreast cancer; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined today by Senator \nHarry Reid and others in introducing the Breast Cancer and \nEnvironmental Research Act of 2003. This bill would establish research \ncenters that would be the first in the Nation to specifically study the \nenvironmental factors that may be related to the development of breast \ncancer. The lack of agreement within the scientific community and among \nbreast cancer advocates on this question highlights the need for \nfurther study.\n  It is generally believed that the environment plays some role in the \ndevelopment of breast cancer, but the extent of that role is not \nunderstood. The Breast Cancer and Environmental Research Act of 2003 \nwill enable us to conduct more conclusive and comprehensive research to \ndetermine the impact of the environment on breast cancer. Before we can \nfind the answers, we must determine the right questions we should be \nasking.\n  While more research is being conducted into the relationship between \nbreast cancer and the environment, there are still several issues that \nmust be resolved to make this research more effective. They are as \nfollows:\n  There is no known cause of breast cancer. There is little agreement \nin the scientific community on how the environment affects breast \ncancer. While studies have been conducted on the links between \nenvironmental factors like pesticides, diet, and electromagnetic \nfields, no consensus has been reached. There are other factors that \nhave not yet been studied that could provide valuable information. \nWhile there is much speculation, it is clear that the relationship \nbetween environmental exposures and breast cancer is poorly understood.\n  There are challenges in conducting environmental research. \nIdentifying linkages is difficult. Laboratory experiments and cluster \nanalyses, such as those in Long Island, New York, cannot reveal whether \nan environmental exposure increases a woman's risk of breast cancer. \nEpidemiological studies must be designed carefully, because \nenvironmental exposures are difficult to measure.\n  Coordination between the National Institutes of Health, NIH, the \nNational Cancer Institute, NCI, and the National Institute of \nEnvironmental Health Sciences, NIEHS, needs to occur. NCI and NIEHS are \nthe two institutes in the NIH that fund most of the research related to \nbreast cancer and the environment; however, comprehensive information \nis not currently available.\n  This legislation would establish eight Centers of Excellence to study \nthese potential links. These ``Breast Cancer Environmental Research \nCenters'' would provide for multi-disciplinary research among basic, \nclinical, epidemiological and behavioral scientists interested in \nestablishing outstanding, state-of-the-art research programs addressing \npotential links between the environment and breast cancer. The NIEHS \nwould award grants based on a competitive peer-review process. This \nlegislation would require each Center to collaborate with community \norganizations in the area, including those that represent women with \nbreast cancer. The bill would authorize $30 million for the next five \nyears for these grants.\n  ``Genetics loads the gun, the environment pulls the trigger,'' as Ken \nOlden, the Director of NIEHS, frequently says. Many scientists believe \nthat certain groups of women have genetic variations that may make them \nmore susceptible to adverse environmental exposures. We need to step \nback and gather evidence before we come to conclusions--that is the \npurpose of this bill. People are hungry for information, and there is a \nlot of inconclusive data out there, some of which has no scientific \nmerit whatsoever. We have the opportunity through this legislation to \ngather legitimate and comprehensive data from premier research \ninstitutions across the nation.\n  According to the American Cancer Society, each year 800 women in \nRhode Island are diagnosed with breast cancer, and 200 women in my \nstate will die of this terrible disease this year. We owe it to these \nwomen who are diagnosed with this life-threatening disease to provide \nthem with answers for the first time.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting and cosponsoring this \nimportant legislation, and ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nlegislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 983\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Breast Cancer and \n     Environmental Research Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer \n     deaths among American women.\n       (2) More women in the United States are living with breast \n     cancer than any other cancer (excluding skin cancer). \n     Approximately 3,000,000 women in the United States are living \n     with breast cancer, 2,000,000 of which have been diagnosed \n     and an estimated 1,000,000 who do not yet know that they have \n     the disease.\n       (3) Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer \n     among women in the United States and worldwide (excluding \n     skin cancer). In 2003, it is estimated that 258,600 new cases \n     of breast cancer will be diagnosed among women in the United \n     States, 211,300\n\n[[Page S5675]]\n\n     cases of which will involve invasive breast cancer and 47,300 \n     cases of which will involve ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).\n       (4) Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer \n     death for women in the United States. Approximately 40,000 \n     women in the United States die from the disease each year. \n     Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death for women \n     in the United States between the ages of 20 and 59, and the \n     leading cause of cancer death for women worldwide.\n       (5) A woman in the United States has a 1 in 8 chance of \n     developing invasive breast cancer in her lifetime. This risk \n     was 1 in 11 in 1975. In 2001, a new case of breast cancer \n     will be diagnosed every 2 minutes and a woman will die from \n     breast cancer every 13 minutes.\n       (6) All women are at risk for breast cancer. About 90 \n     percent of women who develop breast cancer do not have a \n     family history of the disease.\n       (7) The National Action Plan on Breast Cancer, a public \n     private partnership, has recognized the importance of \n     expanding the scope and breadth of biomedical, \n     epidemiological, and behavioral research activities related \n     to the etiology of breast cancer and the role of the \n     environment.\n       (8) To date, there has been only a limited research \n     investment to expand the scope or coordinate efforts across \n     disciplines or work with the community to study the role of \n     the environment in the development of breast cancer.\n       (9) In order to take full advantage of the tremendous \n     potential for avenues of prevention, the Federal investment \n     in the role of the environment and the development of breast \n     cancer should be expanded.\n       (10) In order to understand the effect of chemicals and \n     radiation on the development of cancer, multi-generational, \n     prospective studies are probably required.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Chafee in \nreintroducing the Breast Cancer and Environmental Research Act. Senator \nChafee and I serve together on the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee where we have had the opportunity to take a closer look at \ndifferent environment-related health concerns. After a number of \nchildren in the small town of Fallon, NV, were diagnosed with leukemia, \nthe committee traveled to Nevada to investigate what environmental \nfactors may have contributed to the cancer cluster.\n  The Fallon hearing reminded me how little we know about what causes \ncancer and what, if any, connection exists between the environment and \ncancer. Three decades have passed since President Nixon declared the \n``War on Cancer'' and scientists are still struggling with these and \nother crucial unanswered questions about cancer. This is particularly \ntrue in the case of breast cancer. We still don't know what causes \nbreast cancer. We don't know if the environment plays a role in the \ndevelopment of breast cancer, and if it does, we don't know how \nsignificant that role is. In our search for answers about breast \ncancer, we need to make sure we are asking the right questions.\n  To date, there has been only a limited research investment to study \nthe role of the environment in the development of breast cancer. More \nresearch needs to be done to determine the impact of the environment on \nbreast cancer. The Breast Cancer and Environmental Research Act would \ngive scientists the tools they need to pursue a better understanding \nabout what links between the environment and breast cancer may exist. \nSpecifically, our bill would authorize $30 million to the National \nInstitute of Environmental Health Sciences to establish eight Centers \nof Excellence that would focus on breast cancer and the environment.\n  In the year 2003 alone, it is estimated that 258,600 new cases of \nbreast cancer will be diagnosed among women in the United States. In \nNevada, an estimated 1400 new cases will be diagnosed in 2003, and \ntragically, approximately 300 women in Nevada will die of breast cancer \nthis year. If we miss promising research opportunities because of \nCongress' failure to act, millions of women and their families will \nface critical unanswered questions about breast cancer. During the \n107th Congress, almost half of the Senate cosponsored this important \nlegislation. There is no reason we should not be able to work together \nduring this session to pass this bill so we can find answers for the \nmillions of Americans affected by breast cancer. I urge my colleagues \nto join in our quest for answers about this deadly disease and to \nsupport the Breast Cancer and Environmental Research Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS:\n  S. 984. A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to evaluate \nopportunities to enhance domestic oil and gas\n\n[[Page S5676]]\n\nproduction through the exchange of nonproducing Federal oil and gas \nleases located in the Lewis and Clark National Forest, in the Flathead \nNational Forest, and on Bureau of Land Management land in the State of \nMontana, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am introducing a bill today that I hope \nwill take us one step closer to achieving permanent protections for \nMontana's magnificent Rocky Mountain Front.\n  The Front, as we call it back home, is part of one of the largest and \nmost intact wild places left in the lower 48. To the North, the Front \nincludes a 200 square mile area known as the Badger-Two Medicine in the \nLewis and Clark National Forest. This area sits just south-east of \nGlacier National Park, one of our greatest national treasures. The \nBadger-Two Medicine area is sacred ground to the Blackfeet Tribe. In \nJanuary of 2002, portions of the Badger-Two, known as the Badger-Two \nMedicine Blackfoot Traditional Cultural District, were declared \neligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places.\n  South of the Badger-Two, the Front includes a 400 square mile strip \nof national forest land and about 20 square miles of BLM lands, \nincluding three BLM Outstanding Natural Areas.\n  Not only does the Front still retain almost all its native species, \nbut it also harbors the country's largest bighorn sheep herd and second \nlargest elk herd. The Rocky Mountain Front supports one of the largest \npopulations of grizzly bears south of Canada and is the only place in \nthe lower 48 states where grizzly bears still roam from the mountains \nto their historic range on the plains.\n  Because of this exceptional habitat, the Front offers world renowned \nhunting, fishing and recreational opportunities. Sportsmen, local land \nowners, hikers, local communities and many other Montanans have worked \nfor decades to protect and preserve the Front for future generations.\n  In short, a majority of Montanans feel very strongly that oil and gas \ndevelopment, and Montana's Rocky Mountain Front, just don't mix. The \nhabitat is too rich, the landscape too important, to subject it to the \nroads, drills, pipelines, industrial equipment, chemicals, noise and \nhuman activity that come with oil and gas development.\n  Building upon a significant public and private conservation \ninvestment and following an extensive public comment process, the Lewis \nand Clark National Forest decided in 1997 to withdraw for 15 years \n356,000 acres in the Front from any new oil and gas leasing. This was a \nsignificant first step in protecting the Front from development that I \nwholeheartedly supported.\n  However, in many parts of the Rocky Mountain Front, oil and gas \nleases exist that pre-date the 1997 decision or are located in the \nBadger-Two Medicine area, where the lease suspension could be lifted \nsoon. These leaseholders have invested time and resources in acquiring \ntheir leases. Several leaseholders have applied to the federal \ngovernment for permits to drill. These leases are the subject of my \nproposed bill.\n  History has shown that energy exploration and development in the \nFront is likely to result in expensive and time-consuming environmental \nstudies and litigation. This process rarely ends with a solution that \nis satisfactory to the oil and gas lessee. For example, in the late \n1980's both Chevron and Fina applied for permits to drill in the Badger \nTwo Medicine portion of the Front.\n  After millions of dollars spent on studies and years of public \ndebate, Chevron abandoned or assigned all of its lease rights, and Fina \nsold its lease rights back to the original owner.\n  Therefore, I think we should be fair to those leaseholders. We want \nthem to continue to provide for our domestic oil and gas needs, but \nthey are going to have a long, difficult and expensive road if they \nwish to develop oil and gas in the Rocky Mountain Front.\n  My legislation would direct the Interior Department to evaluate non-\nproducing leases in the Rocky Mountain Front and look at opportunities \nto cancel those leases, in exchange for allowing leaseholders to \nexplore for oil and gas somewhere else, namely in the Gulf of Mexico or \nin the State of Montana. In conducting this evaluation, the Secretary \nwould have to consult with leaseholders, with the State of Montana, the \npublic and other interested parties.\n  When Interior concludes this study in two years, the bill calls for \nthe agency to make recommendations to Congress and the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee on the advisability of pursuing lease \nexchanges in the Front and any changes in law and regulation needed to \nenable the Secretary to undertake such an exchange.\n  Finally, in order to allow the Secretary to conduct this study, my \nbill would continue the current lease suspension in the Badger-Two \nMedicine Area for three more years. This lease suspension would only \napply to the Badger-Two Medicine Area, not the entire Front.\n  That's it, that's all my bill does. It doesn't predetermine any \noutcome, it doesn't impact any existing exploration activities or \nenvironmental processes. It just creates a process through which the \nfederal government, the people of Montana and leaseholders can finally \nhave a real, open and honest discussion about the fate of the Rocky \nMountain Front.\n  I would also point out that the Administration recently completed an \ninventory of the onshore oil and gas reserves on federal lands in five \nbasins in the Interior West, including the Rocky Mountain Front, also \nknown as the Montana Thrust Belt. The Administration's study found that \nthis area contains the smallest volumes of oil and gas resources of all \nfive of the Western inventory areas. For example, the mean estimate of \nall natural gas reserves in the Uinta/Pinceance Basin in Colorado and \nUtah is 22 trillion cubic feet. In the Front, the mean estimate is only \n8.6 trillion cubic feet.\n  Additionally, the study concluded that in reality, the vast majority \nof Federal lands in the interior West are available for leasing with \nfew if any restrictions. Although a large percentage of federal lands \nin the Front are currently unavailable for leasing, many of those lands \nare unavailable because they lie under Glacier National Park, Indian \nlands, and already established wilderness areas, which comprise much of \nthe Federal land in the Front. So, not only is the Front relatively \npoor in terms of oil and gas reserves, many of those reserves--by \nCongressional mandate, executive order or treaty--will never be \navailable for leasing.\n  We should look for ways to fairly compensate leaseholders for \ninvestments they've made in their leases if they decide to leave the \nFront rather than waste years and millions fighting to explore for \nuncertain--and small--oil and gas reserves. A lot of Montanans just \ndon't want to see the Front developed, and they will fight to protect \nit. Including me.\n\n  So, developers can wait years, or decades, or most likely never, for \noil and gas to flow from the Front. Or we can look at ways to encourage \ndomestic production much sooner, in much more cost effective, \nappropriate and efficient ways somewhere else.\n  That is what I hope this legislation will accomplish Mr. President, \nand I hope my colleagues in the Senate will support it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself, Ms. Collins, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Corzine, \n        Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Leahy, Ms. Snowe, \n        Mr. Reed, Mr. Biden, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Schumer, Mr. \n        Lieberman, Mr. Warner, Mr. Johnson, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Carper, \n        Mr. Kerry, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Reid, Mr. Sarbanes, and Mr. \n        Jeffords):\n  S. 985. A bill to amend the Federal Law Enforcement Pay Reform Act of \n1990 to adjust the percentage differentials payable to Federal law \nenforcement officers in certain high-cost areas, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nis important to America's Federal law enforcement officers and the \npeople they protect across the country. I am joined today by Senator \nCollins, Senator Clinton, Senator Corzine, Senator Cantwell, Senator \nDurbin, Senator Grassley, Senator Leahy, Senator Snowe, Senator Reed, \nSenator Biden, Senator Feinstein, Senator Schumer,\n\n[[Page S5677]]\n\nSenator Lieberman, Senator Warner, Senator Johnson, Senator Murray, \nSenator Carper, Senator Kerry, Senator Baucus, Senator Reid, Senator \nSarbanes, and Senator Jeffords.\n  The legislation that we are offering will amend the Federal Law \nEnforcement Pay Reform Act of 1990 to ensure that the government treats \nFederal law enforcement officers fairly. This bill will partially \nincrease the locality pay adjustments paid to Federal agents in certain \nhigh cost areas. These areas have pay disparities so high they are \nnegatively affecting our Federal law enforcement officers, since \nlocality pay adjustments have either not been increased since 1990, or \nhave been increased negligibly.\n  All over America, Federal law enforcement personnel are enduring \ntremendous stress associated with our Nation's effort to protect \ncitizens from the threat of terrorism. Unfortunately, that stress has \nbeen compounded by ongoing pressing concerns among many such personnel \nabout their pay. I have heard from officers who have described long \ncommutes, high personal debts, and in some cases, almost all-consuming \nconcerns about financial insecurity. Many of these problems occur when \nagents or officers are transferred from low-cost parts of the country \nto high-cost areas. I have been told that some Federal officers are \nforced to separate from their families and rent rooms in the cities to \nwhich they have been transferred because they cannot afford to rent or \nbuy homes large enough for a family.\n  Unfortunately, the raise in the cost of living in many cities across \nAmerica has outstripped our Federal pay system. I recognize that this \nis a problem for other Federal employees and I am prepared to work with \nmy colleagues to address this larger issue. The cost of living has also \nhad a very negative impact on non-federal employees as well and I have \nconsistently worked to ensure that all working Americans enjoy a truly \nlivable wage. The legislation that we are introducing today in no way \nsuggests that the needs of other workers should be ignored, but it \nacknowledges that as we continue to ask Federal law enforcement \npersonnel to put in long hours and remain on heightened alert, we must \nprovide them with a salary sufficient to allow them to focus on their \nvital work without nagging worries about how to provide their families \nwith the essentials of food, clothing, and shelter.\n  The Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, representing more \nthan 19,000 Federal agents, along with the Fraternal Order of Police, \nNational Association of Police Organizations, National Troopers \nCoalition, National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives, \nInternational Brotherhood of Police, and the Police Executive Research \nForum have endorsed this legislative proposal.\n  In these difficult times, we must remain committed to recruiting, \nhiring, and retaining law enforcement officers of the highest caliber. \nHowever, we must also recognize that the Federal government is in \ncompetition with State and Local police departments that often pay more \nand provide better standards of living.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to join us in this effort. I hope that we \ncan quickly pass this important legislation because it will improve the \nlives of the men and women who are dedicated to protecting us. In so \ndoing, it will improve the Nation's domestic security.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 985\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President. Today I rise to pay tribute to the hard-\nworking men and women who dedicate their lives to public service. \nWhether it is on the Federal, State, or local level, public servants \nperform essential functions that Americans rely on every day. For this \nreason, it is a privilege to submit a resolution to honor these \nemployees for Public Service Recognition Week. I am delighted to be \njoined in this effort by Senators Fitzgerald, Collins, Lieberman, \nVoinovich, Durbin, Coleman, and Levin.\n  Public Service Recognition Week takes place the week of May 5, 2003. \nSince 1985, the first week in May showcases the talented men and women \nwho serve America as Federal, State and local government employees. \nThroughout the Nation and around the world, public employees use the \nweek to educate their fellow citizens how government serves them, and \nhow government services make life better for all of us.\n  For example, public servants help the Nation recover from natural \ndisasters and terrorist attacks; fight crime and fire; deliver the \nmail; teach our children; provide local transportation; protect the \nenvironment; fight disease and promote better health; improve the \nquality and safety of water and food; and defend our freedom. Since \nSeptember 11, 2001, public servants at the Federal, State, and local \nlevel worked around the clock to prevent terrorist attacks and reduce \nour vulnerability to future attacks in addition to carrying out their \nother job related responsibilities. Such dedication and hard work \ndeserve our recognition.\n  I would like to pay particular attention to the men and women who \nserve in our armed forces, and the civilian employees who support their \nmissions. These employees are key to the security and defense of our \nNation. From the war against terrorism to Operation Iraqi Freedom, our \nmilitary and civilian support staff show courage in the face of \nadversity. They too are ready, willing, and able to make this a safer \nworld.\n  While Public Service Recognition Week represents an opportunity for \nus to honor and celebrate the commitment of individuals who serve the \nneeds of the Nation as government and municipal employees, it is also a \ntime to call on a new generation of Americans to consider public \nservice. As my colleagues know, the Federal Government is facing a \ncrisis in its recruitment and retention efforts. The problem is so \ncritical that the General Accounting Office, GAO, has placed the so-\ncalled `human capital crisis' on its High Risk List. According to the \nGAO, nearly 50 percent of the Federal workforce will be eligible to \nretire by 2005. Although no one knows how many will actually retire, \nthis situation poses serious challenges for succession planning in \naddition to mission performance. Public Service Recognition Week \nprovides an opportunity for individuals to gain a deeper understanding \nof the exciting and challenging work in the Federal Government and \ncareer opportunities available.\n  I invite my colleagues to honor the patriotic commitment to public \nservice that our Federal employees exemplify and to join in the Federal \nGovernment's annual celebration. During the week there will be an \nextensive exhibit on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., showcasing \nmany of our Federal agencies and branches of the military, as well as \nhighlighting the services these agencies provide. In addition to the \nMall exhibits, I encourage my colleagues to recognize Federal employees \nin their states, as well as State and local government employees, to \nlet them know how much their work is appreciated.\n\n[[Page S5679]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/01/senate-section/article/S5678-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5678-S5679]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 130--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT PUBLIC \nSERVANTS SHOULD BE COMMENDED FOR THEIR DEDICATION AND CONTINUED SERVICE \n          TO THE NATION DURING PUBLIC SERVICE RECOGNITION WEEK\n\n  Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Mr. Fitzgerald, Ms. Collins, Mr. Lieberman, \nMr. Voinovich, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Coleman, and Mr. Levin) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs:\n\n                              S.

Res. 3, expressing the sense of Congress with \nrespect to human rights in Central Asia; as follows:\n\n       Strike the preamble and insert the following:\n       Whereas the Central Asian nations of Kazakhstan, \n     Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan are \n     providing the United States with assistance in the war in \n     Afghanistan, from military basing and overflight rights to \n     the facilitation of humanitarian relief;\n       Whereas in turn the United States victory over the Taliban \n     in Afghanistan provides important benefits to the Central \n     Asian nations by removing a regime that threatened their \n     security and by significantly weakening the Islamic Movement \n     of Uzbekistan, a terrorist organization that had previously \n     staged armed raids from Afghanistan into the region;\n       Whereas the United States has consistently urged the \n     nations of Central Asia to open their political systems and \n     economies and to respect human rights, both before and since \n     the attacks of September 11, 2001;\n       Whereas Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, \n     and Uzbekistan are members of the United Nations and the \n     Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), \n     both of which confer a range of obligations with respect to \n     human rights on their members;\n       Whereas while the United States recognizes marked \n     differences among the social structures and commitments to \n     democratic and economic reform of the Central Asian nations, \n     the United States notes nevertheless, according to the State \n     Department Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, that \n     all five governments of such nations, to differing degrees, \n     restrict freedom of speech and association, restrict or ban \n     the activities of human rights organizations and other non-\n     governmental organizations, harass or prohibit independent \n     media, imprison political opponents, practice arbitrary \n     detention and arrest, and engage in torture and extrajudical \n     executions;\n       Whereas by continuing to suppress human rights and to deny \n     citizens peaceful, democratic means of expressing their \n     convictions, the nations of Central Asia risk fueling popular \n     support for violent and extremist movements, thus undermining \n     the goals of the war on terrorism;\n       Whereas President George W. Bush has made the defense of \n     human dignity, the rule of law, limits on the power of the \n     state, respect for women and private property, free speech, \n     equal justice, religious tolerance strategic goals of United \n     States foreign policy in the Islamic world, arguing that ``a \n     truly strong nation will permit legal avenues of dissent for \n     all groups that pursue their aspirations without violence''; \n     and\n       Whereas Congress has expressed its desire to see deeper \n     reform in Central Asia in past resolutions and other \n     legislation, most recently conditioning assistance to \n     Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan on their progress in meeting \n     commitments to the United States on human rights and \n     democracy: Now, therefore, be it\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/01/senate-section/article/S5679-4", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5679-S5680]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n           committee on commerce, science, and transportation\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

CONCERNING THE PARTICIPATION OF TAIWAN IN THE \n                   WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION (WHO).\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Good health is important to every citizen of the world \n     and access to the highest standards of health information and \n     services is necessary to improve the public health.\n       (2) Direct and unobstructed participation in international \n     health cooperation forums and programs is beneficial for all \n     parts of the world, especially with today's greater potential \n     for the cross-border spread of various infectious diseases \n     such as the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), tuberculosis, \n     and malaria.\n       (3) Taiwan's population of 23,500,000 people is greater \n     than that of three-fourths of the member states already in \n     the World Health Organization (WHO).\n       (4) Taiwan's achievements in the field of health are \n     substantial, including one of the highest life expectancy \n     levels in Asia, maternal and infant mortality rates \n     comparable to those of western countries, the eradication of \n     such infectious diseases as cholera, smallpox, and the \n     plague, and the first to eradicate polio and provide children \n     with hepitis B vaccinations.\n       (5) The United States Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention and its Taiwan counterpart agencies have enjoyed \n     close collaboration on a wide range of public health issues.\n       (6) In recent years Taiwan has expressed a willingness to \n     assist financially and technically in international aid and \n     health activities supported by the WHO.\n       (7) On January 14, 2001, an earthquake, registering between \n     7.6 and 7.9 on the Richter scale, struck El Salvador. In \n     response, the Taiwanese government sent 2 rescue teams, \n     consisting of 90 individuals specializing in firefighting, \n     medicine, and civil engineering. The Taiwanese Ministry of \n     Foreign Affairs also donated $200,000 in relief aid to the \n     Salvadoran Government.\n       (8) The World Health Assembly has allowed observers to \n     participate in the activities of the organization, including \n     the Palestine Liberation Organization in 1974, the Order of \n     Malta, and the Holy See in the early 1950s.\n       (9) The United States, in the 1994 Taiwan Policy Review, \n     declared its intention to support Taiwan's participation in \n     appropriate international organizations.\n       (10) Public Law 106-137 required the Secretary of State to \n     submit a report to the Congress on efforts by the executive \n     branch to support Taiwan's participation in international \n     organizations, in particular the WHO.\n       (11) In light of all benefits that Taiwan's participation \n     in the WHO can bring to the state of health not only in \n     Taiwan, but also regionally and globally, Taiwan and its \n     23,500,000 people should have appropriate and meaningful \n     participation in the WHO.\n       (12) On May 11, 2001, President Bush stated in his letter \n     to Senator Murkowski that the United States ``should find \n     opportunities for Taiwan's voice to be heard in international \n     organizations in order to make a contribution, even if \n     membership is not possible'', further stating that his \n     Administration ``has focused on finding concrete ways for \n     Taiwan to benefit and contribute to the WHO''.\n       (13) In his speech made in the World Medical Association on \n     May 14, 2002, Secretary of Health and Human Services Tommy \n     Thompson announced ``America's work for a healthy world cuts \n     across political lines.

Res. 15\n\n       Whereas Abraham Lincoln, the sixteenth President of the \n     United States, issued a proclamation on September 22, 1862, \n     declaring that on the first day of January, 1863, ``all \n     persons held as slaves within any State or designated part of \n     a State the people whereof shall then be in rebellion against \n     the United States shall be then, thenceforward, and forever \n     free'';\n       Whereas the proclamation declared ``all persons held slaves \n     within the insurgent States''--with the exception of \n     Tennessee, southern Louisiana, and parts of Virginia, then \n     within Union lines--``are free'';\n       Whereas, for two and half years, Texas slaves were held in \n     bondage after the Emancipation Proclamation became official \n     and only after Major General Gordon Granger and his soldiers \n     arrived in Galveston, Texas, on June 19, 1865, were African-\n     American slaves in that State set free;\n       Whereas slavery was a horrendous practice and trade in \n     human trafficking that continued until the passage of the \n     Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution ending \n     slavery on December 18, 1865;\n       Whereas the Emancipation Proclamation is historically \n     significant and history is regarded as a means of \n     understanding the past and solving the challenges of the \n     future;\n       Whereas one hundred and forty years after President \n     Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, African Americans have \n     integrated into various levels of society; and\n       Whereas commemorating the 140th anniversary of the \n     Emancipation Proclamation highlights and reflects the \n     suffering and progress of the faith and strength of character \n     shown by slaves and their descendants as an example for all \n     people of the United States, regardless of background, \n     religion, or race: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) recognizes the historical significance of the 140th \n     anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation as an important \n     period in the Nation's history; and\n       (2) encourages its celebration in accordance with the \n     spirit, strength, and legacy of freedom, justice, and \n     equality for all people of America and to provide an \n     opportunity for all people of the United States to learn more \n     about the past and to better understand the experiences that \n     have shaped the Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/01/senate-section/article/S5691-3", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5691]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nCOMMEMORATION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/01/senate-section/article/S5691-4", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5691]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n Mr. McCONNELL.

Res. 75) commemorating and acknowledging the \ndedication and sacrifice made by the men and women who have lost their \n            lives while serving as law enforcement officers.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am happy that the Senate is passing S. \nRes. 75, a resolution that would designate May 15, 2003, as National \nPeace Officers Memorial Day. Senator Campbell and I introduced this \nresolution to keep alive in the memory of all Americans the sacrifice \nand commitment of those law enforcement officers who lost their lives \nserving their communities. We are joined by 20 cosponsors, including \nJudiciary Committee Chairman Hatch, and Judiciary Committee members \nBiden, Durbin, Schumer and Kohl.\n  I commend Senator Campbell for his leadership in this issue. As a \nformer deputy sheriff, he has experienced first-hand the risks faced by \nlaw enforcement officers every day while they protect our communities. \nI also want to thank each of our nation's brave law enforcement \nofficers for the jobs they do. They are real-life heroes, too many of \nwhom often give the ultimate sacrifice, and they remind us of how \nimportant it is to support our state and local police.\n  Currently, more than 850,000 men and women who serve this Nation as \nour guardians of law and order do so at a great risk. Each year, 1 in \n15 officers is assaulted, 1 in 46 officers is injured, and 1 in 5,255 \nofficers is killed in the line of duty somewhere in America every other \nday. After the hijacked planes hit the World Trade Center in New York \nCity on September 11, 72 peace officers died while trying to ensure \nthat their fellow citizens in those buildings got to safety. That act \nof terrorism resulted in the highest number\n\n[[Page S5692]]\n\nof peace officers ever killed in a single incident in the history of \nthis country.\n  In 2002, over 152 law enforcement officers died while serving in the \nline of duty, well below the decade-long average of 165 deaths \nannually, and a major drop from 2001 when a total of 237 officers were \nkilled. A number of factors contributed to this reduction including \nbetter equipment and the increased use of bullet-resistant vests, \nimproved training, longer prison terms for violent offenders, and \nadvanced emergency medical care. And, in total, more than 16,700 men \nand women have made the ultimate sacrifice.\n  National Peace Officers Memorial Day will provide the people of the \nUnited States with the opportunity to honor that extraordinary service \nand sacrifice. More than 15,000 peace officers are expected to gather \nin Washington to join with the families of their fallen comrades who, \nby their last full measure of devotion to their responsibilities and \nthe right and security of their fellow citizens, have rendered a \ndedicated service to our nation. I look forward to passage of this \nimportant resolution, a fitting tribute for this special and solemn \noccasion.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent the resolution be agreed to, \nthe preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and any statement related to this matter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Res. 75) commemorating and acknowledging the \ndedication and sacrifice made by the men and women who have lost their \n            lives while serving as law enforcement officers.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am happy that the Senate is passing S. \nRes. 75, a resolution that would designate May 15, 2003, as National \nPeace Officers Memorial Day. Senator Campbell and I introduced this \nresolution to keep alive in the memory of all Americans the sacrifice \nand commitment of those law enforcement officers who lost their lives \nserving their communities. We are joined by 20 cosponsors, including \nJudiciary Committee Chairman Hatch, and Judiciary Committee members \nBiden, Durbin, Schumer and Kohl.\n  I commend Senator Campbell for his leadership in this issue. As a \nformer deputy sheriff, he has experienced first-hand the risks faced by \nlaw enforcement officers every day while they protect our communities. \nI also want to thank each of our nation's brave law enforcement \nofficers for the jobs they do. They are real-life heroes, too many of \nwhom often give the ultimate sacrifice, and they remind us of how \nimportant it is to support our state and local police.\n  Currently, more than 850,000 men and women who serve this Nation as \nour guardians of law and order do so at a great risk. Each year, 1 in \n15 officers is assaulted, 1 in 46 officers is injured, and 1 in 5,255 \nofficers is killed in the line of duty somewhere in America every other \nday. After the hijacked planes hit the World Trade Center in New York \nCity on September 11, 72 peace officers died while trying to ensure \nthat their fellow citizens in those buildings got to safety. That act \nof terrorism resulted in the highest number\n\n[[Page S5692]]\n\nof peace officers ever killed in a single incident in the history of \nthis country.\n  In 2002, over 152 law enforcement officers died while serving in the \nline of duty, well below the decade-long average of 165 deaths \nannually, and a major drop from 2001 when a total of 237 officers were \nkilled. A number of factors contributed to this reduction including \nbetter equipment and the increased use of bullet-resistant vests, \nimproved training, longer prison terms for violent offenders, and \nadvanced emergency medical care. And, in total, more than 16,700 men \nand women have made the ultimate sacrifice.\n  National Peace Officers Memorial Day will provide the people of the \nUnited States with the opportunity to honor that extraordinary service \nand sacrifice. More than 15,000 peace officers are expected to gather \nin Washington to join with the families of their fallen comrades who, \nby their last full measure of devotion to their responsibilities and \nthe right and security of their fellow citizens, have rendered a \ndedicated service to our nation. I look forward to passage of this \nimportant resolution, a fitting tribute for this special and solemn \noccasion.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent the resolution be agreed to, \nthe preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and any statement related to this matter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Would the distinguished majority whip yield?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have completed a number of unanimous \nconsent requests this evening. A number of them--about 10 in number--\ndeal with various positions that have been confirmed by the Senate this \nevening. These we read off by virtue of numbers. We do this almost \nevery night, but I think sometimes we fail to realize these are real \npeople and they are more than just numbers. The people on this list \nthat we have read off today, they will have celebrations tonight. These \nare extremely important days in the life of every one of these people \nwhose names we have read off today.\n\n  I think it does us good to once in a while just pause and recognize \nthat the things we do here deal with more than just numbers. I ask we \nall once in a while stop and join in the celebration of these victories \nthat these people have.\n  It is difficult, with the present situation--present situation? I \nthink it has been going on for 20 years, how difficult it is to get \nnominations that the President sends to us, Democrat or Republican. The \nprocess is not very good.\n  We are now into the second year of this administration and we are \njust getting approved people he submitted earlier--some of whom he \ndidn't submit earlier--just because the process is so slow. I hope \nsomeday a bipartisan commission or some organization can be set up so \nwe can do this separate and apart from the situation that involves the \njudiciary. But just on nominations that come from the President, we \nneed a system that works much better, more quickly than what we have.\n  I don't want to prolong the point other than to say congratulations \nto all these people who have been approved tonight.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me say to my friend, the assistant \nDemocratic leader, his points are well made both on the congratulations \nthat are certainly due these individuals who have been confirmed \ntonight and on the need to improve the process by which we get \nindividuals confirmed here in the Senate. I must say, without the able \nand effective assistance of the assistant Democratic leader, we would \nnot have been able to clear some of these nominations tonight. I thank \nhim for his perseverance in making that possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/01/senate-section/article/S5692-2", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5692]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     ORDERS FOR MONDAY, MAY 5, 2003\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.
