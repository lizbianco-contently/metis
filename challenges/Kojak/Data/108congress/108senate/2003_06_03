Mr. President, this morning the Senate will resume \nconsideration of S. 14, the Energy bill. There are currently two LIHEAP \namendments pending to the bill, as well as the bipartisan ethanol \namendment. At this time, I urge any Member who wishes to offer an \namendment to contact the chairman or ranking member of the Energy \nCommittee so that time can be scheduled for the consideration of such \namendments.\n  Members should expect rollcall votes during today's session. It is \nanticipated that we will be able to dispose of several energy \namendments later today. Members will be notified, of course, when the \nfirst vote is scheduled.\n  For the remainder of the week, the Senate will continue the \nconsideration of the Energy bill and wrap up action on the Department \nof Defense authorization bill. Rollcall votes are therefore expected \neach day during this week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/03/senate-section/article/S7199-6", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7199]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNITION OF THE ACTING MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn).

I believe that \nis the case.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from Nevada, I believe that is the \ncase.\n  Mr. REID. I think those who have amendments should get to the Chamber \nas quickly as they can because one of the sponsors of one of the \namendments now pending will not be here until this afternoon. So we can \nmove that along with other amendments. It is my understanding that this \nbill, when it was up last year, took 8 weeks. It is my understanding \nthat the majority leader wants to finish this bill within the next 2 \nweeks. So that is a really big order because some of these amendments \nare very difficult. Some of the issues are difficult.\n  I suggest we should get on this as quickly as possible because it is \ngoing to be very difficult to finish this bill in 2 weeks.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, as the Senator from Nevada has \nindicated, it is our hope that we can finish the Energy bill in the \nnext couple of weeks. We intend to pursue that as vigorously as \npossible. The cooperation of all Members toward that end would be \ngreatly appreciated.\n  The assistant Democratic leader is correct; it would be wonderful to \nhave amendments laid down and debated.

Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I yield.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator for coming early this morning and \noffering an amendment to help us get this bill going. We will be \narranging a sequencing of these amendments later in the day. I thank \nthe Senator for bringing forth the amendment at this time.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. This is an amendment to the pending first-degree \nethanol mandate amendment to provide authority to the Administrator of \nthe Environmental Protection Agency to waive the ethanol mandate if a \nState or region does not need to meet the requirements of the Clean Air \nAct.\n  We all must understand this ethanol amendment is a permanent mandate. \nRegardless of what advances are made in technology, whether a hybrid \nengine, whether a hydrogen-driven engine, regardless of any advance, \nthis ethanol mandate is forever. Therefore, it offers very real \nconcern.\n  In the pending first-degree ethanol amendment, there is a waiver now \nthat allows the Administrator of the EPA to waive the ethanol amendment \nif it would harm the economy or the environment of a State, a region, \nor the United States. I believe the EPA Administrator should also be \nable to waive the ethanol mandate if a State or a region does not need \nethanol to make the air cleaner and meet the requirements of the Clean \nAir Act. Why require something that is not needed? Why require it if \nthere should be an advance in technology that makes the use of ethanol \nunnecessary?\n  California and other States that do not need ethanol to meet the \nrequirements of the Clean Air Act should be allowed to make their case \nto the EPA and then the Administrator can decide if the ethanol mandate \nshould be waived.\n  For California, the ethanol mandate will force more ethanol into our \nfuel supply than we need to achieve clean air. The mandate forces \nCalifornia to use over 8 years 2.5 billion gallons that the State does \nnot need.\n  This chart makes very clear this is a superfluous mandate. The blue \nshows what California needs in terms of ethanol over the next 8 years, \nto 2012. The top amount is 143 million gallons. It averages about 140 \nmillion gallons a year. California could use that amount and meet all \nof the clean air standards. This bill requires California to use over \nthis period of time up to 600 million gallons, so it almost triples in \nthe outyears the amount of ethanol that is forced on California beyond \nits need. This is a real problem in terms of legislation. Why would \nanyone force something on a State that it does not need and then \nprovide, if the State does not use it, that it has to pay anyway?\n  If anything is poor public policy, this ethanol mandate is poor \npublic policy. It also actually achieves a transfer of wealth from all \nStates to the midwest corn States.\n  California does not need ethanol to produce cleaner air because the \nState has developed its own unique gasoline formula. Refiners use an \napproach called the predictive model which can produce clean burning \nreformulated gasoline with oxygenates, with less than 2 percent \noxygenate or with no oxygenate at all.\n  As Red Cavaney, president of the American Petroleum Institute, said \nin March before the Energy and Natural Resources Committee:\n\n       Refiners have been saying for years that they can produce \n     gasoline meeting clean-burning fuels and federal reformulated \n     gasoline requirements without the use of oxygenates. . . . In \n     addition, reformulated blendstocks--the base in which \n     oxygenates are added--typically meet RFG performance \n     requirements before oxygenates are added. These facts \n     demonstrate that oxygenates are not needed.\n\n  As a matter of fact, virtually every refiner I talked to says if you \nwant to clean the air, give us flexibility, allow us to blend gasoline \nto do that. In other words, set the standards as the Clean Air Act does \nand allow us to have the flexibility needed to meet those standards.\n  This mandate prevents that. It is driven by the self-interest of the \ncorn States and driven by the self-interest of the ethanol producers, \nof which the largest beneficiary is Archer Daniels Midland. Archer \nDaniels Midland will control 46 percent of the ethanol market, with \nevery other company controlling not more than 6 percent of the market. \nIn essence, what we are doing is giving a huge transfer of wealth to \none American company, an American company that has been convicted of \ncorrupt practices in the 1990s.\n  I have real problems with this bill. As I said, California can \nachieve clean air without the use of oxygenates. The State has long \nsought a waiver of the 2-percent oxygenate requirement. I have written \nand called former EPA Administrator Browner, the current Administrator, \nChristine Todd Whitman, and President Clinton and President Bush, \nurging approval of a waiver for our State. Yet both the Clinton \nadministration and the Bush administration have denied California's \nrequest. Despite the scientific evidence, it is unlikely that the EPA \nAdministrator will ever grant a waiver for California, but I believe \nthe necessity of the ethanol mandate for a State or region should be \nsomething the EPA Administrator considers. I don't believe it is too \nmuch to ask for the EPA to consider if ethanol is needed in a specific \nState or region when determining if a waiver from the mandate should be \ngranted.\n  As I say, this amendment simply amends the waiver part of the Frist-\nDaschle bill to permit a waiver in the event that a State can \ndemonstrate to the EPA Administrator that it can meet the clean air \nstandards without the use of ethanol.\n\n[[Page S7201]]\n\n  I hope this amendment will have an opportunity of being agreed to. I \nbelieve it is the right thing to do. I believe it is the good public \npolicy thing to do. I believe that creating a mandate preventing \nflexibility in the blending of gasoline forever--which this mandate \ndoes--is flawed and potentially dangerous public policy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I wish to comment on some of the \narguments raised by a very dear friend of mine, my colleague from \nCalifornia, Senator Feinstein.\n  First, let me say that 65 percent of all the gasoline utilized today \nin California is blended with ethanol--65 percent. They expect that it \nwill be 80 percent this summer. So four out of five gallons of gasoline \nin California will already be blended with ethanol. I am not sure I \nunderstand what motivation there will be to seek a waiver, when 65 to \n80 percent of all the gasoline is already blended. That is No. 1.\n  No. 2, my colleague noted that she has applied to EPA--she and the \nState of California have sought a waiver under current law. That is the \npoint. The renewable fuels standard will actually provide greater \nflexibility, greater opportunities for States to seek waivers than what \nthey have right now.\n  The waiver she is applying for is the waiver that she seeks under the \nlaw that was passed in 1991. She is frustrated that there has been no \npositive response on the part of EPA. I can understand her frustration \nwith that refusal. But we are talking about the current law. What we \nare suggesting, of course, is that under the new law there will be \nwaiver authority if a case can be made that somehow this is disruptive.\n  Let me emphasize something. There is a very significant misperception \nhere that somehow this renewable fuels standard is a mandate on States. \nThere is not one word in this bill that requires California or New York \nor any State to mandate the utilization of ethanol. It is not in there. \nWhat it does is impose a requirement on refiners. The refiners are the \nones that are going to have to blend ethanol. They can go to the part \nof the country where it makes the most sense. There is not any \nrequirement that States have some percentage of their transportation \nfuel utilized for purposes of meeting the renewable fuels standard.\n\n  We have, as I know the distinguished Senator knows, a credit trading \nprogram in addition which ensures that ethanol is going to be used \nwhere it is most economical. The refiners can make that decision--where \nit is marketable, where it is not. But I would argue if 65 percent is \nany indication of the marketability of ethanol, it is already being \nused in the State of California and it will be used even more this \nsummer.\n  In March, the California Energy Commission stated that:\n\n       The transition to ethanol which began in January of 2003 is \n     progressing without any major problem.\n\n  Those are their words, not mine. There has been no ethanol shortage, \nno transportation delay, no logistical problems associated with the \nincreased use of ethanol. Thus, efforts to carve out California from \nthe RFS, while unjustified, are also completely unnecessary.\n  We have to keep beating down these myths and these concerns generated \nby those who oppose the renewable fuels standard.\n  I might also say the Senator from California might want to explain \nwhy she is supportive of the renewable portfolio standard without \nwaivers. She is, as I am, a consistent advocate of the renewable \nportfolio standard that we will address later on in the debate on \nenergy, which is, in concept, identical to the renewable fuels \nstandard. Yet she is in support of many waivers for the renewable \nportfolio standard. So on the one hand, while she supports portfolio \nnationalization, she would suggest a renewable fuels exemption for \nwaivers in California.\n  No one cares more for her State. No one is more articulate on these \nissues. No one has studied these issues more than has she. We will \ncarry on this debate for months, if not years, to come. At the end of \nthe day, I will respect her and admire her tenacity and persistence as \nmuch as anybody in this Chamber. I just happen to strongly disagree \nwith her in this case. I know that is her feeling with regard to my \nposition. So we will agree to disagree and move on.\n  I yield the floor, having had the opportunity to respond to some of \nthe issues raised.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I look forward to responding to the \ndistinguished Democratic leader, with whom I profoundly disagree. The \ndistinguished Democratic leader made the point--well, California is \nalready using ethanol in its gasoline. My goodness, it is already using \nit up to 65 percent. California is forced to use it. It is forced to \nuse it. Yet it doesn't need to use it. That is my point. The egregious \n2-percent Federal oxygenate requirement forces California to move in \nthis direction if it is going to phase out MTBE, which is another \noxygenate which has been shown to have very detrimental environmental \nand health effects. The Governor has said he is going to phase it out \nby the end of this year. Consequently, to meet the 2-percent oxygenate \nrequirement--which I think is flawed public policy--again, California \nis forced to begin to use this ethanol.\n  The Democratic leader also says that I have supported a renewable \nportfolio standard. In fact I have. California has a renewable \nportfolio standard. It is for wind, it is for solar, it is for \nalternative energies, and California has set it at 10 percent. Yes, I \nsupport that. That is totally different than an ethanol requirement, \nwhich is not a renewable energy source like solar or wind.\n  To add insult to injury, the Democratic leader says this doesn't \nrequire States to use it. Then I ask the question: Why does his \nlegislation exempt Alaska and Hawaii? If it doesn't force States to use \nit, why is there an exemption that exempts Alaska and Hawaii? Let me \nread it to you, on page 4 of the bill:\n\n       Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this \n     paragraph the administrator shall promulgate regulations to \n     ensure that gasoline sold or introduced into commerce in the \n     United States, except in Alaska and Hawaii, on an annual \n     average basis, contains the applicable volume of renewable \n     fuel determined in accordance with subparagraph (b).\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Will the gentle--the Senator yield for an answer to that \nquestion?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Yes, except I am not feeling too gentle at the \nmoment, but I am happy to.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I know she does, because she does want to know the \nanswer to that question. It goes back to the first comment she made. \nThe first comment is that California is forced. California is forced to \nhave a certain standard, meeting the clean air requirements passed in \nthe law of 1991. That is a requirement that the whole country is forced \nto live with.\n  You have to meet that clean air requirement. What California has \nchosen to do--wisely, in my opinion--is to use ethanol to accommodate \nthe goals and requirements set up for the entire Nation with regard to \ncleaning up the air that many of us voted overwhelmingly to do in the \nearly 1990s.\n  Here is the key issue. This isn't some ethanol advocacy group that \nsaid this. This isn't a group of us here in the Senate that have said \nthis but the California Energy Commission, having studied very \ncarefully the utilization and the acquisition of ethanol to meet these \nclean air requirements, said in January of this year that ``the \nintegration of ethanol is progressing without one major problem . . . \nno shortages, no transportation delays, no logistical problems \nassociated with the increased use of ethanol in the State.''\n  That is the response to the first part of the question.\n  Why Alaska and Hawaii? Frankly, I didn't favor carving out Alaska and \nHawaii because I think we could say categorically, regardless of \ncircumstances. But Senators from Alaska and Hawaii were concerned about \nthe fact that they are not part of the contiguous United States; that \nif you are ever going to come into an issue involving transportation, \nAlaska and Hawaii may ultimately create transportation issues which do \nnot exist in the continental United States among the contiguous States. \nAs a result, giving them the benefit of the doubt in the first phase of \nthis integration is something I am willing to accept even though I am \nnot prepared to support.\n  But there is no question, based on current utilization and based on \nthe Department of Energy in California\n\n[[Page S7202]]\n\nthat said themselves there is no integration problem.\n  That is the reason.\n  I thank very much the Senator from California yielding on that \nquestion.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the distinguished Democratic leader.\n  I would like to refute his comment on how well things are going in \nCalifornia and ethanol being accommodated by reading an article in the \nLos Angeles Times of May 10.\n\n       California gasoline prices rose higher and faster than pump \n     prices elsewhere in the nation this year because of supply \n     problems caused by refinery repairs and the transition to a \n     new clean-fuel additive, the U.S. Energy Department said \n     Friday.\n       Refiners in the state are switching to ethanol as part of \n     the recipe for cleaner-burning fuel, eliminating water-\n     polluting methyl tertiary butyl ether, or MTBE, in advance of \n     a Jan. 1 State ban.\n       This change in fuel additives, designed to meet the Federal \n     oxygen requirement for gas, helped push California gas prices \n     higher and might leave the state short of supplies during \n     peak summer driving months, the report by the Energy \n     Information Administration said.\n       That in turn could trigger more frequent price spikes, said \n     the EIA, the Energy Department's research and statistical \n     arm. The agency said the report was a preliminary assessment \n     and that it plans to release more detailed findings this \n     fall.\n       ``There is a chance that California could see a recurring \n     problem with volatility,'' said Joanne Shore, an EIA senior \n     analyst who led the team that produced the report. \n     ``Certainly, that is an issue for this summer that everyone \n     is going to continue to watch.''\n       The report, requested by Rep. Doug Ose (R-Sacramento), \n     provides more ammunition for California officials who have \n     demanded without success that the state be freed from the \n     Federal requirement to add oxygenates to its gasoline.\n\n  I don't understand why the Democratic leader is so determined to \nforce on those who do not want a special mandate, which not only he \ndoesn't want, but who do not need the special mandate. We can have as \nclean a gas as they can refine in South Dakota, provided they refine \ngas in South Dakota. We can do it as well, or better. We can do it in a \nreformulated formula which will mean clean air standards. The 2 percent \noxygenate requirement was flawed and the leader is replacing it with \nsomething equally flawed. Supposing in 5 years we have new technology \nthat enables the cleaner burning engine. We still have to put ethanol \nin it, and we still have to put ethanol in a hydrogen engine.\n  I guess what I object to--and I can go into trade preferences and I \ncan go into subsidies. Subsidies for a mandate is incredible. It is \njust such a bad bill.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Will the Senator yield again?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. No. I would like to ask the Democratic leader a \nquestion, if I might. What objection does he have against my amendment, \nwhich is a simple amendment which simply says if the State can provide \nadequate evidence to the EPA that it can burn or refine gasoline to \nmeet clean air standards that it should not be required to use ethanol? \nWhat objection does he have to that?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I would be happy to respond. The answer \nis that is exactly what we do in the bill--exactly. We provide a \nwaiver. Under the new application, the State of California, if they can \nmake the case that they shouldn't be held responsible or shouldn't be \nheld to the requirement of the legislation, is entitled to the waiver. \nThat is No. 1.\n  No. 2, the Senator from California still has yet to say why on the \none hand she is prepared to support a renewable portfolio standard \napplicable to all States but not a renewable fuels standard. She isn't \nwilling to do that. So there is an inconsistency there that I find \ninteresting.\n  Let me go back.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Let me finish, and then I would be happy to yield.\n  She quoted an article. She has had as much experience as I have had \nwith journalism in the country, and in our lives. I don't know what \njournalistic publication that may have come from. But we know this. We \nknow that oftentimes these columns are written with a built-in bias, \nwith a built-in point of view, and I doubt that she would argue that \nall articles are written with an objective analysis as their \nmotivation. But you have to think that the Department of Energy in \nCalifornia would be objective. They certainly aren't there touting \nethanol as their goal for anything other than what they think is best \nfor California.\n  I am going to quote. She quoted an article. I will quote the report \nfrom California, page III-3, the report of March 28 of 2003, just a \ncouple of months ago.\n\n       Since the price of ethanol to refiners is currently at \n     modest levels relative to gasoline, the recent increase in \n     California's gasoline prices cannot--\n\n  Let me emphasize ``cannot''--\n\n     --be attributable to availability or cost of ethanol.\n\n  That is from the California Energy Department report.\n  That isn't the only one. That was corroborated by the Energy \nInformation Administration here in Washington. The report was provided \nlast month, in May of this year. Let me read from that report on page \nVII:\n  ``Other factors associated with the MTBE/ethanol changeover, such as \nethanol supply and price, and infrastructure to deliver, store and \nblend ethanol, did not seem to be significant issues'' in the \ncalculation of costs.\n  That is Department of Energy information.\n  Here you have the Department of Energy from California and the \nDepartment of Energy from the United States Federal Government both \ncalculating that there is no impact, pricewise, with the integration of \nethanol into gasoline--none.\n  I have seen all these articles, and they all have agendas and they \nall are written in subjective ways to make a point. I thought there was \none again in the Post this morning.\n  But, nonetheless, I think it would be hard for the Senator from \nCalifornia to argue against her own Department of Energy when it comes \nto the calculation of the integration of the ethanol. I know that is \nnot her intention. I think that is what we really have to make sure is \nin the Record--a recognition after careful study that there really \nwasn't any impact on the price of gasoline with the integration of \nethanol.\n  I believe she has the floor and she yielded to me. I would be happy \nto relinquish the floor so she can regain it.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the distinguished Democratic leader.\n  As I understood what he said, he said there is a waiver in the \namendment. Well, indeed there is a waiver in the amendment. It is on \npage 12 of the amendment. It begins on line 12. I would like to read \nit:\n\n       The Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary of \n     Agriculture and the Secretary of Energy, may waive the \n     requirements of paragraph (2) in whole or in part on petition \n     by 1 or more States by reducing the national quantity of \n     renewable fuel required under paragraph (2)--\n       based on a determination by the Administrator, after public \n     notice and opportunity for comment, that implementation of \n     the requirement would severely harm the economy or \n     environment of a State, a region, or the United States; or\n       [secondly,] based on a determination by the Administrator, \n     after public notice and opportunity for comment, that there \n     is an inadequate domestic supply or distribution capacity to \n     meet the requirement.\n\n  There is no waiver if you can meet the clean air standards without a \nrenewable fuel such as ethanol. There is no waiver in this amendment \nfor that. And if you are so sure of the ground you stand on, why, for \nHeaven's sake, wouldn't you allow a waiver if we can demonstrate--this \nis a rhetorical question--if we can demonstrate to the EPA \nAdministrator that, yes, California, through its formula, can \nreformulate gasoline to meet the Clean Air Act without either a 2 \npercent oxygenate requirement or a renewable fuel to the extent that we \nhave here?\n  Also, since you are on the floor, I just want you to see what you are \npressing upon California. As shown on this chart, this is the amount of \nethanol we would have to use, and this is the amount of ethanol your \namendment forces us to use.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I would appreciate finishing, if I might.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Yes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Yes. The Senator mentioned my support of a renewable \nportfolio standard. Indeed, I do support a renewable portfolio \nstandard. But the renewable portfolio standard is essentially a \npercentage requirement that a State would use of renewable fuels,\n\n[[Page S7203]]\n\nsuch as wind, solar, biomass, et cetera. And California has elected to \nprovide that 10 percent of its portfolio should be in wind, solar, \nbiomass, et cetera. I have supported that requirement in this amendment \nas well, and California is able to do it, and has been doing it. I \nthink that is an extraordinarily positive thing.\n  I have great concerns about ethanol because I do not think all of the \nscience has been completed on ethanol. We know ethanol produces a \nbenzene plume which can break away in the ground if the fuel leaks from \nan underground--the minority leader is smiling, but I wonder if this \nsame discussion took place when MTBE was introduced and people thought \nit was going to be just fine. It has polluted about 20,000 wells in \nCalifornia and has shown to have a significant hazard.\n  Now, I think to dismiss this as being wonderful for the environment \nis not quite correct because we know it reduces some components, but we \nalso know it increases other components in the air that produce smog \nand ozone. And California has two of the most difficult nonattainment \nregions in the United States, one of them being the Los Angeles \narea, the other being the Fresno area. I don't know whether this \nrequirement will, in fact, result in California's two difficult areas \nincreasing in smog, but I do think that providing flexibility to a \nmanufacturer to be able to produce reformulated fuels that meet the \nrequirements is important.\n\n  The other thing that is of concern to me, since we are on this, is \nthe safe harbor provision. I know my colleague from California, Senator \nBarbara Boxer, is going to offer an amendment that would remove the \nsafe harbor. The American Petroleum Association, as they have indicated \nto me, agreed to support this largely because they were protected from \nany liability.\n  My understanding is, there is a provision in the amendment offered by \nthe two leaders that would shield ethanol producers and refiners from \nany liability if the fuel additive harms the environment or public \nhealth. Candidly, I find this safe harbor provision astonishing. \nEthanol is subsidized by the Government, protected from foreign \ncompetition by high trade barriers, and now, on top of mandating its \nuse, we are going to exempt the fuel additive from liability in this \namendment. This is unconscionable, and I think it is egregious public \npolicy to mandate ethanol into our fuel supply in the first place and, \neven worse, to provide it with a complete liability protection before \nscientific and health experts can fully investigate the impact of \ntripling ethanol in the air we breathe and the water we drink.\n  As I said, this is exactly the mistake we made with MTBE. Over the \npast several years, we have learned that MTBE has contaminated our \nwater and may, in fact, be a human carcinogen.\n  Last fall, a California jury found that there was clear and \nconvincing evidence that three major oil companies acted with malice by \npolluting ground water at Lake Tahoe with MTBE because the gasoline \nthey sold was defective in design and there was failure to warn of its \npollution hazard.\n  After a 5-month trial, Shell Oil and Lyondell Chemical Company were \nfound guilty of withholding information on the dangers of MTBE. The \nfirms settled with the South Lake Tahoe Water District for $69 million. \nThis case demonstrates why we cannot surrender the rights of citizens \nto hold polluters accountable for the harm they inflict. Yet this \namendment has a safe harbor provision, and if I should be right, and if \nthere should be--and I hope there are not--undue environmental or \nhealth consequences from this mandate, consumers cannot use their right \nto go to court to find justice.\n  So I do not know how those who favor this legislation can exempt the \nethanol industry from this kind of wrongdoing. It is not as if the \nindustry has not had some wrongdoing in the past. So I urge everyone--I \nknow my colleague is going to move this amendment that would remove the \nsafe harbor provision, and I certainly intend to support her in doing \nso.\n  I still--although many other things have been proposed or said by the \ndistinguished Democratic leader--I do not understand why he would have \nopposition to my amendment, why he would say that if the State can \nprove we can produce gasoline without a 2-percent requirement or \nwithout this ethanol mandate that meets clean air standards, we cannot \nget a waiver. That is all we are asking for, that opportunity to make a \nshowing that that is the case. Yet the Democratic leader has produced a \nlot of other things but has not answered why there should not--if you \nare going to have an economic waiver and an environmental waiver--why \nyou cannot have a waiver if a State can show that it does not need \nethanol to maintain clean air standards.\n  So I think it is an eminently fair amendment, and I just have a hard \ntime understanding why we would be so anxious to pass this kind of \npublic policy that mandates on States a use when most people, I think, \nhave derided and derogated mandates from the Federal Government.\n  I would like to make one more point. The last time I looked--and this \nmay have changed--but California is almost up to 100 percent of its \nrefining capacity. My understanding is, if you put ethanol in--probably \nnot in the early years, but in the outyears--to the extent required, we \nwill not have the refining capacity available to maintain this mandate \nwith adequate gasoline.\n  California is predicted to have 50 million people by 2020. They \ndrive. They use gasoline. And I very much worry that refining capacity, \nwhich is about 98 percent at the present time because MTBE minimizes \ngasoline and ethanol requires added gasoline per gallon, that we really \nwon't have the refining capacity. And that will create another problem \nfor California.\n  I am hopeful the Democratic leader would see his way clear to \nallowing California and other States that wish to try to submit a case \nto the EPA, to say we can refine gasoline to meet clean air standards \nwith flexibility and without this mandate, the opportunity to do so.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will have to depart the floor in a \nmoment. Let me attempt to respond again to some of the concerns raised \nby the distinguished Senator from California.\n  I remind my colleagues that California is currently using ethanol in \n65 percent of the gasoline that it markets. That would go up to 80 \npercent this summer. It has gone up to 80 percent. Four out of five \ngallons in California will be using ethanol, and the Department of \nEnergy in California has said there has been no disruption, no \nproblems. There has been absolutely nothing they can point to that \nwould be disadvantageous just to the consumer.\n  Why the Senator from California would believe so strongly about a \nwaiver when one certainly is not needed, given current experience, is \nnot an answer I can provide.\n  Methyl tertiary butyl ether, MTBE, is not something many of us were \nsupportive of when we integrated it in the first place. This was \nsomething that coal companies and many of the petroleum refiners wanted \nas an alternative to ethanol. So it was a compromise. Many of us raised \nquestions even then, back in 1991, whether it was going to be \nadvantageous for us. We predicted that there could be some issues \ninvolving the use of MTBE, and those predictions were borne out.\n  As the case now has demonstrated, we are phasing out MTBE, as we \nshould. But ethanol has shown itself now for 20 years to be what we \nsaid it was. It has proved to be, as advertised, the kind of clean-\nburning fuel that we have sought to increase not only clean air and the \noxygen in gasoline but many other advantages.\n  Here is one fact I hope my colleagues will remember: In the year \n2002, because this country incorporated ethanol into gasoline, the \nDepartment of Energy estimated that we will have reduced--it could have \nbeen EPA; don't hold me to the source but a governmental analysis done \non the effects of ethanol--greenhouse gases by 4.3 million tons. That \nis the equivalent of 636,000 cars taken off the road. That is what we \nhave been able to do just in 1 year, 636,000 cars taken off the road, \nthe equivalent of which we have now acquired or achieved as a result of \nthe utilization of ethanol.\n  Again, as to the chart, I don't know where it came from, but I will \ntell the Senate what the American Petroleum\n\n[[Page S7204]]\n\nInstitute and the California Energy Commission, the Senator's own \ncommission, have said. California will need to use 843 million gallons \nof ethanol to meet the clean air requirements next year, according to \nAPI, but under this amendment they will only have to use 252 million \ngallons. They are already using 600 million this year. California is \nusing 600 million. The requirement would be that they use 252. There \nare the California Energy Commission comments.\n\n  Governor Gray Davis, quoted on March 15, 2002:\n\n       Let's let the Daschle bill pass. Have a nice schedule that \n     will affect the entire country, phase ethanol in, protect the \n     environment.\n\n  That is a quote from the California Governor.\n  California EPA Secretary Winston Hickox:\n\n       We need the Federal law changed for the flexibility that we \n     are not in opposition to the stairstep in terms of the \n     increase of the use of renewable fuels on a national basis. \n     Potentially, ethanol is a creator of business and jobs in \n     California.\n\n  These are from California officials.\n  One other issue, safe harbor. I was interested in comments made by \nthe distinguished Senator from California on safe harbor. She actually \nsupported safe harbor legislation on Y2K in 1999. There was no concern \nthen about safe harbor problems when she voted for it. My other \ncolleagues have voted for it as well.\n  Let me make sure people understand what we are talking about with \nregard to safe harbor. What we did was say if there is a defect in \ndesign or manufacture of renewable fuel by virtue of the legislation we \nare mandating these companies to use, then we will exempt them from \nliability as a result of the mandate. Do you know how many cases that \nis? That is estimated to be two one-thousandths of 1 percent--not two \none-hundredths, not two-tenths but two one-thousandths of 1 percent of \nall cases involved situations where we are providing safe harbor.\n  I will tell you what we are not covering. We are not covering \nnegligence. We are not covering the duty to warn. We are not covering \npersonal injury. We are not covering property damage. We are not \ncovering wrongful death. We are not covering compensatory damages or \npunitive damages. We are not covering all of those things about which \nthe Senator from California has expressed concern. They are covered. \nThey are in there; two one-thousandths of 1 percent providing the same \nsafe harbor she voted for with the Y2K legislation in 1999.\n  I will have to move on to other matters in my schedule. I appreciate \nthe opportunity to discuss many of the questions with the distinguished \nSenator from California. I have no greater respect for anybody in the \nChamber than I do her. I consider her a wonderful and close personal \nfriend. This issue has forced us to agree to disagree for years. This \nyear will be no different. I appreciate her efficacy and yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Might I say to the two Senators debating the issue, \nbecause of management problems, it appears this amendment will be set \naside and will be voted on later in the evening but today, along with \nas many votes as we can stack with it, sometime after 4 o'clock this \nafternoon. I assume that is satisfactory to the Senator from California \nand the minority leader.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. It is. While the Democratic leader is still on the \nfloor, I would like to address his comment about California's support, \ntheoretically, which I don't think is correct. I address it with a \nletter from the California Environmental Protection Agency. California \nis very eager to get out from under the 2-percent oxygenate \nrequirement. Just to sum up this last paragraph of an April 7 letter \nfrom Mr. Winston Hickox, the agency Secretary, it says:\n\n       Some have suggested that California should go along with \n     the safe harbor as a small price to pay for elimination of \n     the 2 percent mandate.\n       I disagree. Such a tradeoff makes no logical sense. \n     Elimination of the costly and unnecessary oxygenate \n     requirement has nothing to do with assuring that the State of \n     California has a full array of enforcement and restitution \n     options available to address MTBE-caused pollution problems. \n     In short, I do not support a tradeoff that puts at risk the \n     health of the citizens of the State.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that this be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                          California Environmental\n\n\n                                            Protection Agency,\n\n                                    Sacramento, CA, April 7, 2003.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: Governor Gray Davis has asked that \n     I respond to your March 24, 2003, letter regarding the fuels \n     provision in the new energy bill being considered by the \n     108th Congress.\n       You asked if Governor Davis agrees with my statement that \n     ``. . . California would rather have the status quo instead \n     of limiting MTBE liability and getting an oxygenate waiver.'' \n     The Governor does agree with this statement; we both feel \n     that limiting liability for MTBE is the wrong approach. I \n     appreciate the opportunity to discuss which ``fuels \n     provisions'' are appropriate for inclusion in any \n     comprehensive federal energy legislation. Specifically, I \n     would like to focus on the MTBE safe harbor language and the \n     two percent oxygenate requirement.\n       As a matter of policy and to preserve our legal options, I \n     am strongly opposed to an MTBE safe harbor. Industry made a \n     calculated business decision to use MTBE with full knowledge \n     that it was a serious threat to groundwater. The State of \n     California and others should not be limited in the ability to \n     take strong action to address pollution problems caused by \n     MTBE.\n       I remain steadfast in my support for elimination of the two \n     percent oxygenate requirement. Studies have consistently \n     demonstrated that this requirement is not necessary to \n     achieve air quality goals and that it unreasonably raises the \n     price of gasoline in California.\n       Some have suggested that California should go along with \n     the safe harbor as a small price to pay for elimination of \n     the two percent mandate. I disagree. Such a tradeoff makes no \n     logical sense. Elimination of the costly and unnecessary \n     oxygenate requirement has nothing to do with assuring that \n     the State of California has a full array of enforcement and \n     restitution options available to address MTBE caused \n     pollution problems. In short, I do not support a tradeoff \n     that puts at risk the health of the citizens of this State.\n       I also look forward to continuing to work with you on these \n     important issues.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Winston H. Hickox,\n                                                 Agency Secretary.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 844 to Amendment No. 539\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I send another amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Feinstein], for herself, \n     Mr. Nickles, Mr. McCain, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Wyden, Mr. \n     Leahy, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Sununu, and Mr. Reed, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 844.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To authorize the Governors of the States to elect to \n               participate in the renewable fuel program)\n\n       On page 6, between lines 17 and 18, insert the following:\n       (C) Election by states.--The renewable fuel program shall \n     apply to a State only if the Governor of the State notifies \n     the Administrator that the State elects to participate in the \n     renewable fuel program.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, what is the amendment?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. The amendment would give the right to the Governors \nof States to opt into the program.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I assume it would be a second-degree amendment.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. A second degree to the Frist-Daschle amendment, yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Is it in order without a consent agreement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator got permission to set aside the \npending amendment by unanimous consent.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. She already did that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. President, this second-degree amendment to the first-degree \nethanol\n\n[[Page S7205]]\n\namendment would require the Governor of each State to opt into the \nethanol mandate. Senators Nickles, McCain, Kyl, Gregg, Wyden, Leahy, \nSchumer, Reed, and Sununu are cosponsors of this amendment. I thank \nthem for their support.\n  The pending first-degree ethanol amendment mandates 5 billion gallons \nof ethanol into our fuel supply by 2012, yet it exempts Alaska and \nHawaii from this nationwide mandate. I strongly believe that each State \nshould have this choice.\n  In the Environment and Public Works Committee, Senator Murkowski \noffered an amendment to the ethanol mandate to exempt Alaska and Hawaii \nfrom the requirement because, first, Alaska and Hawaii are a great \ndistance from the Midwest, where 99 percent of the ethanol is produced \nin the United States; secondly, families and businesses in Alaska and \nHawaii would have to pay exorbitant costs for ethanol to be shipped to \nthese States and blended into their gasoline.\n  I have the same concerns about increased fuel costs to families and \nbusinesses in California if the ethanol mandate becomes law. I am sure \nother Senators up and down the east and west coasts have the same \nconcerns I do.\n  Because moisture causes ethanol to separate from gasoline, the fuel \nadditive cannot be shipped through traditional gasoline pipelines. \nEthanol needs to be transported separately by truck, boat, or rail, and \nblended into gasoline after arrival. Unfortunately, this makes the 1- \nto 2- to 3-week delivery time from the Midwest to either coast \ndependent upon good weather conditions as well as available ships, \ntrucks, and trains equipped to handle large amounts of ethanol.\n\n  According to Steve Larson, former executive director of the \nCalifornia Energy Commission:\n\n       The adequacy of logistics to deliver large volumes of \n     ethanol to [California] on a consistent basis is uncertain.\n\n  In sum, it will be extremely costly to ship large amounts of ethanol \nto California and other States.\n  I believe every State outside the Midwest will have to grapple with \nhow to bring ethanol to their States since the Midwest controls 99 \npercent of the production. Last year, the General Accounting Office \nindicated how unequal the effects of the mandate will be across the \nNation. As the GAO reported:\n\n       Ethanol imports from other regions are vital. However, any \n     potential price spike could be exacerbated if it takes too \n     long for supplies from out-of-State (primarily the Midwest, \n     where virtually all of the production capacity is located).\n\n  Mr. President, on the issue of increased costs, let me quote from a \nWall Street Journal editorial that ran last year:\n\n       If consumers think the Federal gas tax is ugly, this new \n     ethanol tax will give them shudders. Moving ethanol to places \n     outside the Midwest involves big shipping fees or building \n     new capacity. Refiners also face costs in adding ethanol to \n     their products. According to independent consultant Hart \n     Downstream Energy Services, the mandate would cost consumers \n     an extra annual $8.4 billion at the pump the first 5 years. \n     New York and California would see gas prices rise by 7 to 10 \n     cents a gallon.\n\n  So Hart Downstream Energy Services is estimating an annual $8.4 \nbillion increase cost at the pump over the first 5 years. They are \nsaying that New York and California would see gas prices rise by 7 to \n10 cents a gallon. Therefore, any shortfall in supply, either because \nof manipulation or raw market forces, will be exacerbated on the west \nand the east coasts, which will be reliant on ethanol coming from \nanother region of the United States. Are we not just asking for trouble \nby mandating ethanol nationwide if it is produced almost entirely in \none region?\n  The fraud and manipulation that went into the California energy \nmarket 2 years ago wasn't expected, nor did anyone ever believe it \nwould happen. But it did. I think there is a problem when you \nconcentrate too much control in either one region or in one producer. \nAs you know, this bill does both. The largest production center is the \nMidwest, and the largest producer is Archer Daniels Midland, and they \nproduce 46 percent of the supply. This sets up a scenario that leads to \nthe concern, I believe, of both coasts about this mandate.\n  Since Alaska and Hawaii have an exemption in the ethanol mandate, why \nnot give other States the opportunity to choose whether they want to \nenter the program? Why not give this choice to California, Oregon, \nWashington, Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, \nConnecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, \nVirginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida? These \nare States that are far from the Midwest but where families and \nbusinesses will have to pay more for gasoline under the ethanol \nmandate.\n  This ethanol mandate forces ethanol into our fuel supply nationwide, \nand under the credit trading provisions of the mandate, if States do \nnot use the ethanol, they have to pay for it anyway. This really adds \ninsult to injury. If you do not use it, you have to pay for it anyway. \nWhat kind of public policy is that?\n  Additionally, forcing States to use ethanol they do not need and \nforcing States to pay for ethanol they do not use amounts to a transfer \nof wealth from all States to the midwest corn States.\n  Remember, ethanol is not necessary to achieve cleaner air. For \nCalifornia, the ethanol mandate will force more ethanol into our fuel \nsupply than we actually need to achieve clean air. Once again, I will \nshow you that chart because the cumulative answer to this chart is that \nit forces California to use 2.5 billion gallons of ethanol it does not \nneed over 8 years, and that is fact.\n  If the ethanol amendment proves itself, if it cleans the air and does \nnot pollute the air with increased ozone or smog and if it is cost \neffective, Governors will want to include their States. In fact, I \nbelieve most States in the Midwest will opt into the ethanol mandate \nbecause that is where 99 percent of the ethanol is produced.\n  The belief is there are 69 votes to support this ethanol mandate in \nthis House. If that is true, what are they worried about? We would have \n34 or 35 States automatically opting in. Why not give those few States \nthat have real concerns and want out of the 2-percent oxygenate mandate \nand also out of the ethanol mandate the opportunity to show that they \ncan reformulate gasoline to meet clean air standards without the amount \nthat is prescribed upon them by this mandate?\n  This year we saw retail gasoline prices across the U.S. In the United \nStates, retail gas prices rose from $1.44 to $1.73 per gallon over the \nfirst 10 weeks of this year. California's gasoline prices rose even \nmore precipitously than across the United States, climbing from $1.58 a \ngallon on January 1 to a record setting $2.15 a gallon on March 17.\n  I recall on a recent weekend during that period when I was in the \nState, I actually paid, for the first time in my life, $50 for a \ntankful of nonpremium gasoline.\n  Since the middle of March, gasoline prices have decreased largely due \nto the decrease in the price of crude oil since the war in Iraq has \nended. But gasoline in my State still sells for around $1.80. That is \nstill up 30 cents from the beginning of the year.\n  One reason prices are so high is that the 1990 Clean Air Act required \nStates to use fuel additives, called oxygenates, that we no longer need \nto achieve cleaner air. This ethanol mandate offered by the majority \nand minority leaders will only trade one bad requirement, the 2-percent \noxygenate requirement, for another, the ethanol mandate, because now we \nwill be mandating 5 billion gallons of ethanol into our fuel supply.\n\n  Since there are high costs for States, such as California, to comply \nwith any mandated Federal requirement, and these costs are passed on, \nas we all know, to drivers at the pump, the ethanol mandate amounts \neffectively to a hidden gas tax, and I think consumers should know \nthat. In fact, when we pass this mandate, not only are we passing \nsubsidies for the industry, not only are we mandating its use, but we \nare also providing a gas tax raise.\n  Instead of mandating 5 billion gallons of ethanol into our fuel \nsupply, we should be lifting all mandates, or at least allow the \nGovernor of a State to opt in to this mandate if that State wishes to. \nWe need to provide flexibility to refiners for them to optimize how and \nwhat they blend instead of forcing them to blend gasoline with either \nMTBE or ethanol.\n\n[[Page S7206]]\n\n  Without eliminating these mandates, we can expect disruptions and \nprice spikes during the peak driving months of this summer, on top of \nthe high price motorists are already paying.\n  Bob Slaughter, the president of the National Petrochemical and \nRefiners Association, wrote in a letter to all Senators last week:\n\n       Forcing ethanol's use throughout the Nation will reduce \n     flexibility in this Nation's gasoline manufacturing and \n     distribution system, raise environmental concerns in ozone \n     control areas--\n\n  For me, that is the Los Angeles area and the Fresno Central Valley \narea--\n\n     and will result in increased costs. And this is in addition \n     to the fact that the product is uneconomic without the very \n     significant Federal subsidies--a total of roughly $10 \n     billion--it has received for 25 years.\n\n  This is not me saying this. This is the president of the National \nPetrochemical and Refiners Association pointing out that ethanol to \ndate has received roughly a $10 billion subsidy which this bill, of \ncourse, continues, and increases.\n  Proponents of the ethanol mandate argue that gas price increases will \nbe minimal, but their projections do not take into consideration the \nreal-world infrastructure constraints and concentration in the market \nthat I have just pointed out on this chart--concentration in the \nmarketplace that could lead to price spikes. If I have ever seen a \nscenario that lends itself to control of the marketplace and to \npotential antitrust violations, it is this one.\n  Just look at the disparity. It is not spread out evenly: 46 percent \nfor one company; Williams, 6 percent; Cargill, 5 percent; High Plains \nCorporation, 4 percent; New Energy Corporation, 4 percent; Midwest \nGrain, 3 percent; and Chief Ethanol, 3 percent. If I have ever seen a \nscenario for market concentration, it is this one.\n  The second-degree amendment I have offered will require the Governor \nof a State to opt into the ethanol mandate. If the amendment offered by \nthe two leaders is so fine, so good, so beneficial for all of America, \nthen Governors should want to include their States.\n  The Senators from Alaska and Hawaii have worked to allow their States \nto be exempted from this mandate. That is the first break in the dike. \nThey said they did not even want to try it. I believe, and the \ncosponsors of this amendment believe, each and every State should have \nthis choice.\n\n  If this program, as put forward by the leaders, is so fine, the \nGovernors will opt in. If they believe it enables their State to have \ncleaner air, the Governors will opt in. If they believe they can \nproduce the adequate infrastructure, the Governors will opt in. If they \nbelieve they want to see the tariff protection, the subsidies, the \npotential taxes at the pump, their Governor will opt in. But to force \nit on a State, when that State does not require it, when it can meet \nthe clean air standards in another way, I believe is wrong-headed and \nshort-sighted public policy.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this second-degree amendment.\n  Before I yield the floor, I remind the Chair I have offered two \nseparate amendments, the EPA waiver first and the State opt-in as a \nsecond freestanding amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Senate \namendment No. 539, the renewable fuels package to the Energy bill, and \nto oppose the opt-in and waiver amendments of the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  First, I will talk a little bit about the renewable fuels package and \nits benefit to the people of this country. The amendment contains \nlanguage which was voted out of the EPW Committee, of which I am a \nmember, earlier this year. The language establishes a nationwide \nrenewable fuels standard of 5 billion gallons by 2012, repeals the \noxygenate requirement for reformulated gasoline under the Clean Air \nAct, and also phases down the use of MTBE over 4 years. The language in \nthis amendment has strong bipartisan support and is the result of long \nnegotiation between the Renewable Fuels Association, the National Corn \nGrowers Association, the Farm Bureau, the American Petroleum Institute, \nthe Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management, and the \nAmerican Lung Association.\n  I am very familiar with the amount of work that went into drafting \nthe compromise legislation. It was lengthy, it was open, and I was very \npleased all of these various groups could get together and work out \nthat big compromise, particularly the Senator from Ohio, who has \nAshland-Marathon Oil and also represents the sixth largest State in \ncorn production.\n  I emphasize that the passage of the ethanol bill will protect our \nnational security, help our economy, and protect our environment. The \namendment the majority and minority leaders have introduced is a \ncompromise that will triple the amount of domestically produced ethanol \nused in America. It is an essential tool to reducing our dependence on \nimported oil. I think we all know over 58 percent of the oil we use in \nthis country is imported. Last year, we imported an average of \n4,558,000 barrels per day from OPEC countries and 442,000 barrels a day \nfrom Iraq. Let me say that again. Last year, we imported nearly a half \nmillion barrels of oil from Iraq, and this dependence is not getting \nany better.\n\n  The Energy Information Administration estimates our dependency on \nimported oil could grow to nearly 70 percent by the year 2020, and our \nPresident has stated repeatedly that energy security is a cornerstone \nfor national security. I agree. It is crucial we become less dependent \non foreign sources of oil and look to domestic sources to meet our \nenergy needs.\n  Ethanol is an excellent domestic source. It is clean burning. It is a \nhomegrown renewable fuel that we can rely on for generations to come. \nThe renewable fuels standard in this language will displace 1.6 billion \nbarrels of oil. Ethanol is also good for our Nation's economy. Tripling \nthe use of renewable fuels over the next decade will reduce our \nnational trade deficit by more than $34 billion. By 2012, it will \nincrease the U.S. gross domestic product by $156 billion. It will \ncreate 214,000 new jobs, expand household income by an additional $51.7 \nbillion, and save taxpayers $3 billion annually in reduced Government \nsubsidies due to the creation of new markets for corn. All of us who \nwere concerned about the farm bill that passed last year are concerned \nabout these subsidies. The passage of this ethanol amendment will help \nreduce the subsidy by $3 billion.\n  The benefits for the farm economy are even more pronounced. As I \nmentioned, Ohio is the sixth in the Nation in terms of corn production \nand is among the highest in the Nation in terms of putting ethanol into \nour gas tanks. Forty percent of the gasoline in Ohio is ethanol blend.\n  An increase in the use of ethanol across the Nation means an economic \nboost to thousands of farm families across my State. Currently, the \nethanol production provides 192,000 jobs and $4.5 billion in net farm \nincome nationwide. The passage of this amendment will increase the net \nfarm income by nearly $6 billion annually, which is significant. \nPassage of this amendment will create $5.3 billion of new investment in \nrenewable fuels production capacity.\n  Phasing out MTBE on a national basis will be good for our fuel supply \nbecause refiners are under tremendous strain from having to make \nseveral different gasoline blends to meet various State clean air \nrequirements. And no new refineries--I want to underscore--no new \nrefineries in this country have been built in the last 25 years. The \neffects of the various State responses to the threat of MTBE \ncontamination, including bans and phaseouts on different schedules, \nwill add a significant burden to existing refineries.\n  The MTBE phaseout provisions in this package will ensure that \nrefiners will have less stress on their system and that gasoline will \nbe more fungible nationwide. Expanding the use of ethanol will also \nprotect our environment by reducing auto emissions, which will mean \ncleaner air and improved public health.\n  Use of ethanol reduces emissions of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons \nby 20 percent. Ethanol also reduces emissions of particulates, which \nare a real problem in this country today, by 40 percent. Use of ethanol \nRFG helped move Chicago into attainment of the Federal ozone standard, \nthe only RFG area to see such an improvement. It was done in the \nChicago area by using ethanol.\n\n[[Page S7207]]\n\n  In 2002, ethanol use in the United States reduced greenhouse gas \nemissions, something we have talked about a great deal on the Senate \nfloor, by 4.3 million tons. Listen to this: The equivalent of removing \nmore than 630,000 vehicles from the road. Think of that.\n  Over the course of the debate on this amendment, several arguments \nagainst the renewable fuels package have been raised by our colleagues \nfrom California and New York, ranging from concerns that a renewable \nfuels standard cannot be met and will raise gasoline prices to claims \nthat ethanol is bad for the environment and allegations that this \npackage will benefit a select number of producers without helping our \nfarmers. These arguments remind me of the adage that you cannot let the \nfacts get in the way of a good argument.\n  The concerns raised by opponents of the renewable fuels standard \nconcerning the impact of RFS, the fuel supply, and gasoline prices, \nwhile understandable, I believe are completely unfounded. The fact is, \nour farmers will be able to meet the ethanol standard, and the \ncombination of the MTBE phaseout and oxygenate waiver in this package \nwill significantly improve our fuel supply system and lower costs for \nconsumers.\n  Our farmers can meet the ethanol standard. For 2003, the ethanol \nindustry is on pace to produce more than 2.7 billion gallons. The \namount of ethanol required under the RFS begins at 2.6 billion in 2005. \nAdequate ethanol supply is simply not an issue.\n  Currently, 73 ethanol plants nationwide have the capacity to produce \nover 2.9 billion gallons annually. Further, there are 10 ethanol plants \nnow under construction which when completed will bring the total \ncapacity to more than 3.3 billion gallons. That is today. We are \ntalking about 5 billion by the year 2012. There is no problem with \nachieving that goal.\n  California has been cited as a major problem area. However, all but \ntwo small refineries have already transitioned from MTBE into ethanol. \nCalifornia will use close to 700 million gallons of ethanol in 2003 \nafter consuming roughly 100 million gallons last year. Think of that: \nFrom 100 million last year to 700 million this year.\n  The California Energy Commission has concluded the transition to \nethanol ``is progressing without any major problems.'' The U.S. Energy \nInformation Administration found the transition went ``remarkably \nwell.'' The Energy Information Administration studied the RFS without \naccounting for the impact of banking and trading credits. This means \nthey analyzed the effective cost of ethanol being blended at every \nsingle refinery and concluded the impact on refiner costs would be one-\nhalf of 1 percent per gallon. However, it was noted with credit trading \nethanol will not need to be blended at every refinery. Forget about the \nfact we built into this the credit trading provision. This would reduce \nthe impact because refiners will have the flexibility to use ethanol \nwhere it makes the most sense economically. Look around the country and \nthey can trade, use it where it makes most sense economically.\n  In the absence of Federal legislation, consumers will likely be \nsubject to the costs of uncoordinated State action, individual States \nadding the MTBE but cannot change the Federal RFG oxygen content \nrequirement. This bill does that; it gets rid of that requirement.\n  The coalition of these two elements will likely lead to higher costs \nunless this bill is passed. For instance, California will ban MTBE in \n2004 and the Federal RFG oxygenate requirement will be left in place if \nthis does not pass. Therefore, California's required ethanol use in \n2005 would be 895 million gallons. However, if the fuels provision of \nthis amendment is enacted, fuel providers in California would be \nrequired to use far less ethanol in 2005, 291 million gallons, which \ncould be even less with the bill's credit banking and trading \nprovisions.\n  There is a lot of flexibility for States to do what is in their best \ninterest. With a State MTBE ban set for January 2004, New York faces a \nsimilar situation. Under the status quo, fuel providers would be \nrequired to use 197 million gallons of ethanol in New York in 2005. \nHowever, if the amendment is passed, refiners, blenders, and importers \nwould be required to use or purchase credits for even less--100 million \ngallons of ethanol in 2005.\n  A study concluded by Mathpro, a prominent economic analysis firm, \nfound that compared with the situation where States are banning MTBE \nand the Federal RFG oxygen content requirement is left in place, the \nfuels provisions would decrease the average gasoline production cost by \n2 cents per gallon. In addition, the fuels provisions provide \nsafeguards in the event that RFS would severely harm the economy or the \nenvironment or would leave a potential supply and distribution problem, \nthe RFS requirement could be reduced or eliminated.\n\n  The status quo situation creates transportation and infrastructure \nproblems. It is individual State bans, as in California and New York, \nwhich will require the transport of large amounts of ethanol to States \nfar from where it is produced. In contrast, a critical element of this \nfuels package is a national RFS with, as I mentioned, a credit banking \nand trading program to ensure that renewable fuels will not have to be \nin every gallon of gasoline. This will allow refineries to use ethanol \nwhere it makes the most sense.\n  Furthermore, ethanol is already blended from Alaska to Florida and \nfrom California to New York. Ethanol is already transported via barge, \nrailcar, and ocean-going vessels from markets throughout the country. \nThe U.S. Department of Energy studied the feasibility of a 5 billion \ngallon per year national market for ethanol and found no major \ninfrastructure barriers exist and needed investments on an amortized \nper-gallon basis are modest and prevent no major obstacle.\n  Let's talk about our farmers and how it helps them. Some of my \ncolleagues have used the supplier ADM, Archer Daniels Midland, as an \nargument that the market is dangerously concentrated. Contrary to the \ncharts presented by the Senator from California, with the current \nindustry expansion, ADM, according to the information I have, is at 32 \npercent of total capacity. By comparison, farmer-owned ethanol plants \nhave increased their percentage of total production capacity from 20 \npercent in 1999 to 38 percent today. I know in my own State when I met \nrecently with our farm community, there is talk of our farmer community \ninvesting in two new plants that will be owned by the farmers in the \nState of Ohio.\n  Furthermore, when ADM purchased another ethanol producer last year, \nthe Department of Justice investigated the impact this would have on \ncompetition. They found that ``the acquisition did not warrant \nchallenge in terms of its potential effect in the ethanol market.''\n  Contrary to claims of entry into the marketplace problems, the \nindustry has grown by leaps and bounds over the past 3 years with 30 \nnew facilities built since 2001. According to the Federal Trade \nCommission merger guidelines, entry time of less than 2 years is not \nconsidered a barrier to entry. The average entry time of the new \nethanol facility is from 15 to 20 months. If the industry continues to \nadd 8 to 10 facilities a year through 2012, we will have an additional \n70 new facilities across this Nation to take care of any market control \nthat anyone might want.\n  Both the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Congressional Budget \nOffice have recognized the benefit of the investment of the ethanol \nprogram on the overall health of the Nation's economy. Recently, the \nUSDA stated that the ethanol program would decrease farm program \npayments by $3 billion. In its analysis of this amendment, CBO stated \nthe provision would reduce direct spending by $2 billion during 2005 to \n2013.\n  Let's talk about the impact on the economy. Tripling the use of \nrenewable fuels over the next decade will also reduce our national \ntrade deficit by more than $34 billion. A lot of our trade deficit has \nto do with importing oil. It will increase the U.S. gross domestic \nproduct by $156 billion by 2012. It will create more than 214,000 jobs. \nIt will expand household income by an additional $51.7 billion. As I \nsaid, it will save taxpayers a lot of money because of reduced \nGovernment subsidies to the agricultural community.\n  The benefits for the farming community are even more pronounced. An \nincrease in the use of ethanol across the Nation means an economic \nboost to thousands of farm families across the\n\n[[Page S7208]]\n\nStates through this country. Currently, ethanol production provides \n192,000 jobs and 4.5 billion in net farm income nationwide. Passage of \nthis amendment will increase net farm income by $6 billion annually. As \nI said before, it will create 5.3 billion in new investment and \nrenewable fuels production capacity.\n  Now, the environment. It has been brought up that ethanol is bad for \nthe environment, that there have been problems and red flags thrown \nabout the use of ethanol.\n  The Clean Air Act's reformulated gasoline program requires the same \nsmog-reducing characteristics for gasoline whether blended with MTBE or \nethanol. In other words, if you use ethanol you still must comply with \nthe Act.\n  The RFS agreement includes strong anti-backsliding provisions that \nprohibit refiners from producing gasoline that increases emissions once \nthe oxygenate requirement is removed. A Governor can also petition EPA \nfor a waiver of the ethanol requirement based on supporting \ndocumentation that the ethanol waiver will increase emissions that \ncontribute to air pollution in any area of the State. So if there is a \nperiod during one year where there may be a problem, a Governor can ask \nfor a waiver from one provision.\n  The fuels agreement would benefit the environment in a number of \nways:\n  It reduces tailpipe emissions of carbon monoxide, VOCs, and fine \nparticulates.\n  It phases down MTBE over 4 years to address groundwater \ncontamination, and since ethanol biodegrades quickly, it will not have \nthe same problem.\n  It provides for one grade of summertime Federal RFG, which is more \nstringent.\n  It increases the benefits from the Federal RFG program on air toxic \nreductions.\n  It provides States in the ozone transport region an enhanced \nopportunity to participate in the RFG program because of unique air \nquality problems.\n  It includes provisions that require EPA to conduct a study on the \neffects on public health, air quality, and water resources of increased \nuse of potential MTBE substitutes, including ethanol.\n  The use of ethanol-blended fuels also reduces so-called greenhouse \ngas emissions by 12 to 19 percent compared with conventional gasoline, \naccording to Argonne National Laboratory. In fact, Argonne states \nethanol use last year in the U.S. reduced the so-called greenhouse gas \nemissions by approximately 4.3 million tons, equivalent to removing the \nannual emissions of more than 636,000 cars. Additionally, a new report \nfrom the Pew Center on Global Climate Change concluded that:\n\n       During the next 15 years, replacement fuels offer the \n     greatest promise for reducing transportation sector \n     [greenhouse gas] emissions.\n\n  Regarding benzene, there have been no conclusive studies showing \nethanol-blended gasoline, leaked into an existing benzene plume would \nresult in further benzene spread--blending ethanol usually equates to \nless benzene in gasoline.\n  According to the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management:\n\n       We are satisfied to have reached an agreement that \n     substantially broadens the ability of the U.S. EPA and our \n     Nation's Governors to protect, and in some cases improve, air \n     quality, and public health as we undertake major changes in \n     the Nation's fuel supply.\n\n  Also, after an environmental impact analysis, the California \nEnvironmental Policy Council gave ethanol a clean bill of health and \napproved its use as a replacement for MTBE in California gasoline.\n  The fuels agreement is supported by the American Petroleum Institute; \nthe Renewable Fuels Association; the Northeast States for Coordinated \nAir Use Management--NESCAUM; the American Lung Association; U.S. \nChamber of Commerce; US Action; the Union of Concerned Scientists; the \nEnvironmental and Energy Studies Institute; the Governor's Ethanol \nCoalition.\n  We have heard so much talk about letting Governors opt into this \nprogram. I want to make it clear the Governors' Ethanol Coalition is \nsupporting this ethanol agreement and this amendment. General Motors \nand, as Senator Daschle mentioned earlier today in his response to the \nSenator from California, the Governors of California and New York also \nsupport this amendment, plus all of the major, of course, agricultural \norganizations in the United States.\n  Again, I want to state for my colleagues particularly, there were \nmany public and well-attended stakeholder meetings leading to this \nhistoric RFS fuels agreement.\n  So many times there are issues that come before the Senate where we \nhave groups that have differences of opinion. So often, these groups \nnever get together and talk to each other; they talk past each other. \nAs one who has been so involved in this whole issue of ethanol, \nbeginning frankly when I was Governor of the State of Ohio, I was \nalways concerned that somehow we just could not get the folks from the \noil industry and the corn growers and other groups together to talk \nabout how we could come up with something that would make sense, that \nwould satisfy their respective needs, to underscore the importance of \nthe fact that they had a symbiotic relationship with each other; if \nthey got together, they could come up with something that would achieve \ntheir respective goals.\n  That happened. It doesn't happen very often around here, but it did \nhappen. I will never forget the press conference that was held in the \nLBJ Room. On that stage were representatives from a dozen or so \norganizations in this country, organizations that, if someone had said \nthey would be on the stage together supporting this ethanol compromise, \npeople would have said: No way. No way.\n  It happened. So I am saying to my colleagues, this has been vetted. \nIt has been discussed. We have a good compromise. Let's not diminish it \nwith the amendments that are going to be submitted to this very \nimportant amendment, this amendment that is so important for our \ncountry.\n  By the way, this bill has to get done this year. If we do not get \nthis amendment done and deal with the oxygenate program and the MTBE, \nwe are going to have chaos--chaos. If the people in California and New \nYork think the gasoline price is high now, if this is not passed, it \nwill go sky high.\n  I am saying to everyone, please, let's support this amendment and \nvote against any of the amendments to this amendment that are being \nsubmitted by some of my colleagues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment offered \nby the Senator from California, the second-degree amendment, that I \nthink injects a level of fairness in the underlying amendment. I \nrespect the work of my colleague from Ohio and his appreciation for the \neffort that went into crafting the underlying amendment that doubles \nthe ethanol mandate. Yet, I think that amendments can be offered to \nmake this Energy bill as a whole, and this ethanol provision, a lot \nmore sensible, make it a lot more fair to taxpayers, make it fair to \nStates, and even improve the environment.\n  I want to touch on a few of those points. Certainly we will hear from \na lot of Senators from States that benefit from the ethanol program and \nwill benefit from an expansion in the ethanol program. They see its \neconomic impact, perhaps, at the local level with their farmers or at \nthe corporate level with some of the very big agribusiness concerns \nthat benefit from this program. But I think we need to take a balanced \napproach. I think we need to weigh the impact on consumers. I think the \nSenator from California, Mrs. Feinstein, has done an exceptional job of \nlaying out the importance of reacting to the needs of those consumers, \nand the importance of taking a balanced approach. She has been a great \nleader on this issue, and I am pleased to be a cosponsor of her \namendment.\n  As she indicated, doubling the ethanol mandate will have very \nsignificant costs. It will impose a burden on the States. There may \nwell be an ethanol coalition of Governors, many of whom have economies \nin their home States that will benefit from the ethanol mandate. But we \ncannot escape the fact that this mandate does represent a burden on \nStates, a burden on industry, and a burden on consumers. I think there \nare very questionable benefits outside a few of those farm-driven \neconomies that I mentioned.\n  On the environment, the Senator from California has offered an \namendment that in no way exempts States\n\n[[Page S7209]]\n\nfrom their obligations under the Clean Air Act, and in no way exempts \nthem from having to meet the standards that any other State would meet \nin cleaning up the air we breathe. What it would do, simply, is to \nallow States to decide how to go about meeting those tough standards \nand would give States the chance to opt out of this ethanol mandate if \nthey could otherwise meet those clean air standards.\n  This does nothing to diminish our commitment to the Clean Air Act. \nThis does nothing to diminish our commitment to the environment.\n  So one has to ask the question: Why then mandate the use of this \nproduct, ethanol, on all 50 States? Although it has been pointed out \nthat it is not actually 50 States, it is 48 States, as two States are \nalready exempt from this requirement. I certainly believe you wouldn't \nexempt States from this mandate unless you recognized that it did have \ncosts associated with it, and very significant costs at that.\n  This amendment offered by the Senator from California protects every \nbit our commitment to the Clean Air Act and to the environment. But it \ndoes reflect new costs to consumers--new costs from the logistics and \nshipping that is going to be required to move ethanol around the \ncountry. As has been pointed out, ethanol cannot move through the gas \nlines which already exist in this country. It has to be trucked and \nshipped and blended on the spot.\n  As the Senator from Ohio pointed out, we can do this. We have \ninfrastructure that can accomplish this task. I would offer no \ndisagreement there. Yes, we have trucks, ships, logistics, planners, \nand computer software to get it to where it needs to be, whether it \ntakes a week or 2 or 3 weeks. That kind of a system is more susceptible \nto interruption and, therefore, price spikes. But we have the \ntechnology and capability to ship this mandated product around the \ncountry in order to blend it.\n  But we are just fooling ourselves if we pretend it wouldn't cost the \nconsumer extra--and it will. We can have a debate as to whether or not \na mandate will increase consumer prices 2 cents, or 4 cents, or 5 \ncents, over what amount of time, and why. But those newly imposed \nlogistic requirements will cost money. I think we are going to address \nthis cost issue.\n  I know the Senator from New Mexico is working on an amendment that \nwill highlight the concern we should all have--that a mandate such as \nthis increases the price to all consumers in the country. But we have \nto be wary of the costs. We also have to be aware of the fundamental \nfairness: Why give exemptions to two States and not allow other States \nto opt out of this program? I trust the States. I trust the Governors. \nI trust State legislators to take good steps that are in their self-\ninterest to protect the environment in their States, to serve their \nconsumers, and to ensure that they have an energy system that serves \ntheir States.\n  The Senator from Ohio said specifically that there is a lot of room \nin this legislation for States to do what is in their best interests. \nBut then he suggested that to allow States to opt out would somehow \nencourage them to take steps that would make the system too complicated \nand actually raise prices back home in their States.\n  I don't think you can have it both ways. You can't say States will \ntake steps in their best interests, but then suggest that if we gave \nthem the opportunity to opt out of this program, they would take steps \nthat weren't in their best interests. I think they will do the right \nthing. Certainly, when it comes to meeting the tough requirements of \nthe Clean Air Act, I think States will do the right thing. And where \nethanol makes sense environmentally and economically, States will move \nquickly to use it to the greatest extent possible.\n  From the standpoint of the environment, the Feinstein amendment does \nnot weaken any legislation. From the standpoint of costs, the \nunderlying amendment certainly increases the cost to the consumer. It \nis equally important from the standpoint of basic fairness that we \ntreat all the States equally. If we allow some to opt out, we should \nallow them all to opt out if they so choose.\n\n  Given these facts, why would we force this mandate on the States? I \ndon't know for sure what the answer is. But I think in part we are \nforcing this subsidy on the States to benefit some big, profitable \ncompanies. We can argue whether the five or six largest ethanol firms \ncontrol 60 percent of the market or 70 percent of the market. But these \nare good, strong, profitable companies. They have great employees, and \ngood leadership, I hope. But they ought not to be given a subsidy on \nthe backs of consumers all over the country. We should not be providing \na subsidy to these six or seven large firms and increasing the cost to \nconsumers, while at same time we could be depleting $2 billion a year \nfrom the Highway Trust Fund when this mandate is phased in.\n  The Senator from Ohio pointed out that the Congressional Budget \nOffice has said this will reduce direct spending by $2 billion. That is \nbecause it is going to suck $2 billion out of the Highway Trust Fund. \nUnfortunately, the result is more likely than not to be moving general \nfund money over into the Highway Trust Fund. That is not something I \nthink we should be doing.\n  I think we need to be honest to the voters and honest to the \nconsumers that when they pay taxes at the pump, it goes into the \nHighway Trust Fund and gets spent on infrastructure in this country. \nEthanol is given an enormous, significant tax subsidy. I guess it \ndepends on what you consider enormous. Is $1 billion or $2 billion \nenormous? It is certainly in my State. Some people would argue it is \nonly a few cents, or 2 pennies. But $2 billion is real money where I \ncome from. To take $2 billion a year out of the Highway Trust Fund, I \nthink, is a mistake.\n  The reason we have heard a subsidy was justified in the past was that \nwe needed the subsidy to get consumers to use the product. This \nlegislation mandates that consumers use the product. You can't have it \nboth ways. You can't mandate that they use it and then continue to give \nit a subsidy.\n  I suggest one or the other has to go. Either we have to allow States \nto opt out of this program and let the taxpayers in those States who \nthink it is a good idea subsidize it, or we ought to get rid of the tax \nsubsidy altogether.\n  The Senator from California has put together a good, thoughtful \namendment that respects rights and lets States opt out of this program. \nI think this is the right approach. I support her amendment and I look \nforward to working with her further on this issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle in support of the renewable fuels standard amendment \nto S. 14, the Energy bill on the floor.\n  I paid close attention to the comments made by the distinguished \nSenator from New Hampshire. I don't know whether I should make the \nremarks I have prepared or try to refute the things he said point by \npoint. Maybe I will do a little bit of both and blend them up a little.\n  There was one statement made by the Senator from New Hampshire that I \ndid want to point to at the beginning that I think is somewhat \nerroneous. The Senator from New Hampshire said there is going to be \nthis money sucked out of the highway trust fund because of the use of \nethanol. As everyone knows, there is a Finance Committee amendment that \nis going to be added to this measure or the Highway bill by both \nSenator Grassley and Senator Baucus. It has broad bipartisan support. \nThat amendment will address this issue. It was reported out of the \nFinance Committee. As I said, it has broad-based support I believe on \nboth sides of the aisle. This proposal would reshape the ethanol excise \ntax exemption. Ethanol blended fuels will make a similar contribution \nto the highway trust fund as regular gasoline.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HARKIN. The proposal by the Finance Committee will actually add \n$2 billion to the highway trust fund annually.\n  Yes, I would be delighted to yield for a question.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Is the Senator suggesting that ethanol under this \nlegislation be subject to the exact same excise tax to which gasoline \nwould be subject?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am not certain I understand the import of the question.\n\n[[Page S7210]]\n\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Gasoline is subject to a Federal excise tax of 18.3 cents \nper gallon. The Senator's description suggests that ethanol will now be \ntaxed at 18.3 cents a gallon as well and that revenue will go into the \nhighway trust fund.\n  Mr. HARKIN. No. What I am suggesting is that in the past, as we know, \na portion of the money was not added to the highway trust fund, it was \nadded to the general fund. And there was a partial exclusion from tax \non each gallon of gasohol sold. In effect we are making the highway \ntrust fund whole in the expected Finance Committee amendment.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. If the Senator will yield slightly further, that is \nprecisely the point I was making--that ethanol will not be subject to \nexcise taxes. It will require taking money from the general fund to pay \nfor this tax and putting it into the trust fund, so that the trust fund \nwon't be depleted as a result of the fact that ethanol is not subject \nto the full 18.3 cent tax. If we treat the two equally, we should \nsubject them both to an 18.3-cent tax. If you give ethanol the subsidy, \nwhat you are forced to do--exactly what you described--is move general \nfund money into the trust fund to cover that loss of revenue.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I say to my friend from New Hampshire, what we are doing \nis not taking money from the general fund. What we are doing is taking \nthe money from the ethanol part of that which went to the general fund \nand putting it where it should have been in the first place; and that \nis, the highway trust fund. That is all we are doing. We are not taking \nmoney out of the general fund that comes from general income taxes and \nevery other kind of excise taxes that are paid in this country. We are \nonly talking about ethanol. It will add about $2 billion to the highway \ntrust fund annually.\n  The other point the Senator from New Hampshire made, which I wish to \nrespond to, is on the issue of whether or not this is a great burden on \nthe States.\n  In California, nearly all of the refiners have voluntarily switched \nfrom MTBE to ethanol in advance of the State's MTBE phaseout deadline \nof January 1 of next year. Today, approximately 65 percent of all \nCalifornia gasoline is blended with ethanol. It is estimated that 80 \npercent of fuel in California will contain ethanol by this summer.\n  I am told that last month the California Energy Commission stated \nthat the transition to ethanol, which began in January of 2003, is \n``progressing without any major problems.'' There have been no ethanol \nshortages, transportation delays, or logistical problems associated \nwith the increased use of ethanol in California. Thus, any efforts to \ncarve out California, per the Feinstein amendment or amendments, from \nthe renewable fuels standard, are unjustified and unnecessary.\n  Most ethanol sold in California is under a fixed price contract at \nabout 63 cents per gallon, after the tax incentives are applied. \nWholesale gasoline in California--that is what ethanol is blended \nwith--is selling for $1.04 a gallon on average. So ethanol is cheaper \nper gallon in California than is regular gasoline. So how can this be a \nburden at all on California?\n  This renewable fuels standard, as has been said by so many before me, \nwill increase the use of ethanol and other renewable fuels--including \nbiodiesel; not just ethanol, but biodiesel--in the Nation's fuel supply \nfrom 2.6 billion gallons in 2005 to 5 billion gallons in 2012. This \namendment is very similar to the language we overwhelmingly passed out \nof this body in the last Congress as part of a comprehensive Energy \nbill package. It represents the culmination of a historic fuels \nagreement negotiated by the agriculture, renewable fuels, petroleum, \nand environmental communities over the past several years.\n  Unfortunately, the agreement--the amendment we passed overwhelmingly \nlast year--did not become law in 2002 due to the demise of the Energy \nbill in conference negotiations. This year, we must pass the renewable \nfuels standard and have it signed into law by the President, who has \nindicated his support for this.\n  The renewable fuels standard is truly an energy security measure. The \nformer Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, James Woolsey, \nbelieves the renewable fuels standard is an essential component in the \nadvancement of America's energy security. His sentiments have been \nechoed as well by ADM Thomas Moorer, former Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, and Robert McFarlane, former National Security Adviser \nunder President Reagan.\n\n  The renewable fuels standard will displace about 1.6 billion barrels \nof imported oil over the next decade. As a result of this, we will save \n$4 billion in imported oil each year. This is a critically important \nfirst step toward energy independence for America.\n  As far as our economy goes, this renewable fuels standard amendment \nwill add about $156 billion to our gross domestic product by 2012, \nspurring about $5.3 billion in new investment and creating 214,000 new \njobs. It will boost farm income by $1.3 billion annually.\n  I am very proud of the example set by my own State of Iowa where we \nhave 12 plants producing more than one-fifth of U.S. ethanol. We have \ntwo biodiesel plants, which place Iowa first in the Nation in producing \nthis soy-based fuel. Thirty percent of our corn crop goes into value-\nadded ethanol production, supporting over 1,500 jobs, and pumping \nnearly $50 million annually into our State's economy, which is of \ncritical help to our rural communities.\n  These biofuels plants serve as local economic engines--providing \nhigh-paying jobs, capital investment opportunities, increased local tax \nrevenue, and value-added markets for our farmers. A very large share of \nthis production in Iowa is in plants built with the investments of \nfarmer-owners.\n  I want to add a statement. I was looking at one of the charts my \nfriend from California, Senator Feinstein, had, which showed that \nArcher Daniels Midland had 46 percent of the production capacity--I \nthink is what the chart showed--and all the rest of the plants around \nfilled in the other 54 percent.\n  Well, it is true that Archer Daniels Midland has been a leader in \nethanol production in this country. I commend them for it. They have \nreally paved the way. They broke through the barrier. They invested the \nmoney in finding new ways and new technologies and a cost-effective \nmeans of producing and distributing ethanol. So I believe it would be \nnormal for a company such as Archer Daniels Midland to have a \nsignificant share of production capacity because they were there first. \nThey recognized the environmental impact it would have in cleaning up \nthe environment, the impact it would have on saving us from imported \noil, the impact it would have on local jobs and the economies in many \nStates, and what it would mean to replace a potentially carcinogenic \noctane enhancer called MTBE.\n  So, yes, I commend Archer Daniels Midland for being a leader many \nyears ago in starting to produce ethanol before many others even really \nthought about it. It is a very forward-looking company. They were there \nfrom the beginning.\n  I would point out, however, that most of the new productive capacity \ncoming on line in America is from farmer-owned cooperatives, farmer-\nowned plants. They are the ones building the new plants in cities and \ncommunities that dot our countryside. I think you have to look at this \nin that context.\n  So, yes, I commend Archer Daniels Midland for being a leader in this \nmany years ago, and for bringing us to the point where now we can spin \noff and spur more ethanol plant construction throughout the United \nStates that basically is owned by smaller entities or by farmers \nthemselves.\n  As I said, these plants serve as local economic engines in so many of \nour communities. The value-added benefits of ethanol mean a $2 bushel \nof corn is converted into $5 of fuel and feed coproducts. That is \nanother thing that people forget, that once we take the alcohol out of \nthe corn, we have a very valuable byproduct left that can be fed to \nlivestock, basically to cattle. So you get kind of two bangs for the \nbuck out of it.\n  The renewable fuels standard is more than just about increasing this \nuse of fuels; it is more than just about cutting down on the imported \noil; it is more than just the economic engines that it provides in many \ncommunities; it is also about providing a healthy and\n\n[[Page S7211]]\n\nsustainable environment for future generations.\n  Ethanol and biodiesel greatly benefit public health and the \nenvironment by protecting air and water quality and reducing greenhouse \ngas emissions. They are nontoxic, biodegradable, energy efficient, and \ncleaner burning sources of energy than petroleum-based fuels. A new \nreport by the Pew Center on Global Climate Change finds that ethanol-\nblended fuels offer us the greatest promise for reducing \ntransportation-related greenhouse gas emissions over the next 15 years.\n  The U.S. Department of Energy has concluded that petroleum-based \nfuels account for 82 percent of carbon monoxide, which, according to \nthe National Research Council, accounts for 20 percent of smog \nformation in cities. In contrast, the Environmental Protection Agency \nhas determined that ethanol-blended fuels significantly reduce these \nemissions, and biodiesel nearly eliminates sulfur emissions that \ncontribute to acid rain and reduces potential cancer-causing compounds.\n  Clearly, the renewable fuels standard represents a momentous \nopportunity to enhance our Nation's energy security, strengthen our \neconomy, create jobs, boost farm and rural income, and help clean up \nour environment. The 5 billion gallons of renewable fuels that would \nultimately be required by the renewable fuels standard would replace \ngasoline we currently get from foreign oil, and at the same time reduce \nthe price at the pump. Simply put, renewable fuels make good, common \nsense for our Nation and all of its citizens.\n  More to the point of the amendment now before us by the Senator from \nCalifornia on State exemptions--there is really no need to grant States \nexemptions right now because in the underlying bill it already provides \nfor States to be able to apply for and be granted an EPA waiver if they \ncan show the RFS severely harms the economy or environment of the State \nor if there is an inadequate domestic supply or distribution capacity \nto meet the requirement. So, really, the amendment offered by the \nSenator from California is unneeded because there is already a waiver \nprovision in there.\n  Well, our renewable fuels standard is something we passed last year \noverwhelmingly with bipartisan support. I know there will be several \nattempts here to weaken it. I hope we again have, as we did last year, \noverwhelming bipartisan support to keep this strong renewable fuels \nstandard in this bill and, get this Energy bill through and to the \nPresident so he can sign it this year.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to discuss with the Senate where \nwe are. As manager of the bill, I am interested in trying to see if we \ncan entice and excite Senators about bringing their amendments that \nhave to do with the ethanol part of this bill to the floor today, if \npossible. We have two pending and, very shortly, we will have a consent \nagreement regarding voting on those two. That would give us the \nafternoon for further discussion on and the reception of other \namendments with reference to ethanol--if Senators desire to do that. We \nare aware of two or three others, perhaps four Senators who would like \nto offer amendments regarding ethanol.\n  I remind Senators there are many more issues in this Energy bill, \nalthough this is a very important one. Obviously, we want it thoroughly \ndebated and, ultimately, hopefully, from the managers' standpoint, we \nwould like it to be adopted as part of the bill. Sooner or later, we \nhave to head on to some of the other provisions. There are seven or \neight contentious ones at least that need to be discussed. We are now \nawaiting final word from the other side as to whether we can proceed. I \nunderstand we can.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/03/senate-section/article/S7211-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7211]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, I want to speak briefly on the renewable \nfuels standard that is the subject of the Frist-Daschle amendment, and \nspecifically with regard to a report released today by the National \nCorn Growers which contains yet another round of good news regarding \nethanol.\n  For decades, those of us who care about energy in the United States \nand care about energy independence, who care about jobs and the \ncreation of jobs, who care about the future and how we are going to \nhave enough energy for this economy to expand throughout the 21st \ncentury have looked for alternative sources of energy. The Energy bill \nwe are debating is a great progrowth, projobs Energy bill across the \nboard. It encourages the production of traditional forms of energy, and \nit should. It encourages the production of oil and natural gas and \nnuclear energy. I support all of that. I think most of us in this \nSenate do. But all of us are concerned about the fact that the \ntraditional forms of energy tend to be nonrenewable. There is a point \nat which we are in danger of running out. We import a lot of oil from \nforeign countries. About 59 percent of what we use in the United States \nwe import.\n  We have all wanted and have talked about for decades the possibility \nof renewable sources of energy, particularly that we can make here. I \ngo around Missouri and I talk with our corn growers and other \nagricultural producers about what a great day it will be when we can \ngrow our own fuel effectively and when we don't have to worry about \nrunning out and being dependent on other countries.\n  As the Frist-Daschle amendment indicates, that day, if it is not \nhere, is fast approaching. We are close to being able to grow our own \nfuel. That fuel is ethanol. It is a great day when that means more jobs \nfor America. It will mean a greater measure of energy independence for \nour country and a greater measure of energy security for our country. \nIt will mean support for and new markets for our family farmers and our \nagricultural producers. It is a good thing.\n  I am glad Senator Frist and Senator Daschle have offered this \namendment. I am a strong supporter of it. In fact, I am a cosponsor of \nit. I am proud of the fact that ethanol will be the subject of one of \nthe first genuine bipartisan efforts in this country, and I hope that \namendment passes.\n  The Corn Growers issued a report today designed to rebut some of the \nconcerns that people have expressed. It is kind of ironic that we are \nnow approaching this day when we actually have access to renewable \nsources of energy and alternative fuels. And some are getting nervous \nabout it. Their report issued today indicates what common sense already \ntells us.\n  First of all, blending ethanol with gasoline at a 10-percent level, \nwhich is what the renewable fuels standard calls for, will reduce the \nretail price of conventional gas by 5 percent or 6.6 cents per gallon \nbased on national average 2002 prices. This translates into an annual \nsavings to consumers of $3.3 billion. The report says that. They have \nstudied it for a long time. It really is a matter of common sense \nbecause when you increase the supply, the price goes down. The more \nethanol we produce, the more we can rely on renewable sources we can \ngrow and the greater the supply of energy.\n  The report also indicated that using corn and other grains to produce \nthe 5 billion gallons of ethanol required by the renewable fuels \nstandard will have an insignificant impact on consumer food prices.\n\n  In other words, the price of corn and other items is not going to go \nup because we have tremendous productive capacity in this country. As a \nmatter of fact, we are not using the capacity we have. As a matter of \nfact, the price to consumers is going to go down because as our \nproducers are able to grow corn and turn it into a value-added \ncommodity, a valuable commodity, ethanol, the price of future farm \nbills is going to go down.\n  I was impressed very much when I was in Macon, MO, visiting our \nethanol plant there. One of the producers who owns that plant pulled me \naside and said: Senator Talent, the real good thing about this is when \nthe price of corn goes down, I make more money on the ethanol.\n  I thought to myself: Yes, that is one of the keys to ethanol. It will \nhelp smooth out some of the cycles of commodity prices, the ups and \ndowns of commodity prices worldwide, which will mean that farm bills \nwill become less challenging every 5 years. It will also mean more \nmoney for the transportation trust fund once we have adopted the tax \nchanges that the Finance Committee has worked out and which will \naccompany or follow shortly after this Energy bill.\n  It is a good thing for America. It is a good thing for our producers. \nIt is a good thing for the creation of jobs.\n  I am glad this amendment is being offered. I want to address briefly \nthe amendment of the Senator from California. I know it is an amendment \noffered in good faith. It is an amendment to exempt California from the \nrenewable fuels standard. It is a little hard for me to understand \nbecause the standard is not a mandate for the States. It is a mandate \nfor the refineries. They have to have 5 billion gallons of ethanol \nrefined and into circulation by the year 2012. That should not be \ndifficult.\n  The use of ethanol is growing all over the country, precisely because \nof the advantages it offers, which I have outlined. Exempting States \ndoesn't make any sense. California is already using ethanol. By this \nsummer, 60 to 70 percent of the gasoline sold in California will be an \nethanol blend.\n  I suspect that maybe States such as California think: we don't \nproduce ethanol here; we don't want to have to import energy from other \nStates. If you do not import energy from other States, and if you do \nnot import ethanol from other States, you are going to have to import \nsomething from someplace in order to run the automobiles. I would a \nwhole heck of a lot rather have States in this country importing \nethanol, which is good for the environment and jobs in the United \nStates, from other States in the U.S. than the alternative, which is to \nimport gasoline, which is not as good for the environment and which \ndoes not mean jobs for our country, from Venezuela or from the Arab \nStates or from some other place in the world. They are taking one of \nthe tremendous virtues of the renewable fuels standard and trying to \nturn it into a vice.\n  It will reduce our dependence on foreign countries.\n  There is really no danger to the United States being dependent on \nfuel that we produce in the United States. It is a good thing to be \ndependent on fuel we produce in Missouri or Minnesota or North Dakota \nor South Dakota or Illinois or any of the number of States that produce \nethanol.\n  I understand the uneasiness. The use of ethanol is growing very fast. \nIts future is coming on us very fast. Sometimes change is difficult to \ndeal with. I was in a Breaktime convenience store in Columbia, MO, \nwhere they are selling ethanol at the pump for the same price they have \ntraditionally sold gasoline. I went to this place, stood out next to \nthe pump, talked to the proprietors, and said: This is the future. It \nis a good future. It is a national future for the United States. This \nis a national energy policy. We have one Union, not just 50 different \nStates. We have one national economy, and we ought to have one \nrenewable fuels standard for everybody, and we ought to have confidence \nin it.\n  I think this 5-billion-gallon standard will be very easily attained. \nI think we will be above that. States all over the country and \nconsumers all over the country are using ethanol to their benefit and \nto the benefit of the Nation as\n\n[[Page S7213]]\n\na whole. This is a pro-jobs, pro-growth Energy bill, and the Frist-\nDaschle amendment is a very important pro-jobs, pro-growth, pro-energy \nsecurity and independence part of it.\n  Let's adopt that amendment. We do not need these weakening \namendments. Let's face the future with confidence. One of the reasons \nwe can do that is because the Nation will increasingly rely on fuel \nthat we produce in this country in the 50 States.\n  I thank the Senate for its attention, Mr. President, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, at this point I want to talk to the general \nsubject of the two second-degree amendments offered by the Senator from \nCalifornia which will be pending for us to vote on later this \nafternoon. They both have to do with the requirement under the \nunderlying amendment to impose an ethanol requirement for gasoline \nthroughout the country and to not allow States to opt in or opt out of \nthat mandated ethanol requirement.\n  One of the amendments by the Senator from California is to allow an \nopt-in, so that States that believe this will help them deal with their \nproblems of ozone and the environment or other environmental pollution \ncan opt into this program and take advantage of it; but for those \nStates that believe it would be harmful to their environment, they \nwould not have to opt in. The other amendment would require findings \nwith respect to whether or not it would help the environment.\n  I want to comment about that because the State of Arizona is one of \nthe States that would be adversely affected by a requirement to use \nethanol. Partly, this is as a result of the fact that the climate in \nArizona is very warm, shall we say, particularly in the summertime. Our \nsummer runs essentially from April through October. During that period \nof time, ethanol does not work well in communities such as Yuma, AZ, \nand Tucson, AZ, because of the way it interacts with the surrounding \nhot air, and the product that is produced, the moisture from the \ntailpipe of the automobile, interacts with the air to in fact produce \nozone, which is the very thing we are trying to prevent by the use of \noxygenated fuel. As a result, Arizona has used an MTBE substitute \noxygenate that doesn't create the same problem ethanol creates in the \nhot environs of the climates in Yuma or Tucson, AZ.\n  As you know, MTBE is associated with some environmental damage to \naquifers, where MTBE has spilled into them inadvertently and, as a \nresult, MTBE is being phased out.\n  Arizona receives all of its gasoline from refineries in California. \nTherefore, decisions California makes pretty well impact on what \nArizona has available to it for its vehicle use. This is why, \nnaturally, the points of the Senator from California are exactly the \npoints I make, because they apply to the refineries in her State and \nthe same kinds of climatological requirement that my State of Arizona \nhas with respect to environmental protection.\n  So let me refer to several points with respect to the ethanol mandate \nand begin with that point of environmental impact. Ethanol is an \nextremely volatile fuel. It breaks down very quickly. In fact, it is \nvirtually impossible to transport by pipeline because of this. It has \nto be transported by truck. Obviously, it is not produced in the West, \nin States like Arizona. It would have to be trucked in from other \nplaces such as the Midwest. This adds to the cost of the fuel, but that \nis another matter. Ethanol has been used as an additive in gasoline \nsold in the Phoenix and Tucson areas. But according to the Arizona \nDepartment of Environmental Quality, the State agency of the State of \nArizona that is responsible for environmental protection in the State \nof Arizona, this mandate would be very bad for communities, as I said, \nlike Yuma and Tucson, probably causing those areas to violate the 8-\nhour ozone standard under the Clean Air Act. This would have dramatic \neffects in Arizona. Those communities would be out of compliance.\n\n  There are a whole host of economic negative effects from finding a \nviolation of the ozone standard. How can it be that the use of an \noxygenate such as this would create more ozone? Because of the unique \nclimate in Arizona in the summertime where, instead of reducing the \namount of ozone particulate, it increases it.\n  Given the fact that there is no evidence that the use of oxygenates \nlike ethanol would help improve the quality of air in Arizona, it seems \nto me a finding from the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality \nthat says Arizona communities would likely violate the 8-hour ozone \nstandard by being forced to use ethanol is a very powerful argument for \nthe Governor of the State of Arizona having the option of opting into \nthis program.\n  Why would the other States force on Arizona a program which our own \nDepartment of Environmental Quality says is going to make the air \nworse, not better--in fact, so much worse it will be in violation of \nthe Clean Air Act? It is not as if the committee and the proponents of \nthe underlying amendment have not understood that the mandate should \nnot apply to all States. In fact, two States are specifically \nexempted--Hawaii and Alaska--from this mandate.\n  Why, if it is appropriate to exempt two States, is it not appropriate \nto at least afford other States the option of submitting themselves to \nthis mandate or not, depending upon whether this mandate would make \ntheir air quality worse or better? It seems to me if we are really \ntalking about environmental quality here, rather than a subsidy for the \ncorn industry in the Midwest, then we would be looking at the \nenvironmental impact of a mandate of this sort. Since we have already \ndecided that two States should not be required to comply with this \nmandate, we have already crossed the bridge of saying it is appropriate \nto exempt some States. Why not allow those States, with their \ndepartments of environmental quality having said they would be harmed, \nthe ability to opt out, or the requirement that they opt in, in order \nfor the program to be effective in the State? Why not allow that option \nfor those States? What is so important about this mandate that every \nsingle State, except two--and I don't know why these two were \nexempted--is not at least given the opportunity to exempt itself from \nthe provision?\n  It seems to me there has to be something else involved here. I \nsuspect it has to do with the desire of the corn producers and the \npeople who transform the corn into an ethanol kind of product to make a \nbuck. But we already provide them a lot of bucks through the subsidy \nfor ethanol that has already been voted on by the Congress, has already \nbeen in existence for many years, and which will increase in this bill. \nI could understand--I would not agree with it--a subsidy to try to \nproduce more of something we think we want to produce. Even though I \ndon't think that is a good idea, I could at least understand the theory \nthat if we want more of something, we are going to have the Government \nprovide a subsidy to produce more of it. I could also understand the \nalternative, which would be that this is such a good idea that we are \ngoing to force people to do it; we are going to mandate it because we \nin Washington know best, of course, and therefore irrespective of what \nthe environmental quality people in your own State believe, by golly, \nwe know better, so we are going to make them do it.\n  What is a little hard for me to understand is why we still need the \nsubsidies if we are going to have this mandate. The purpose of the \nsubsidies was to try to encourage this production, but we do not need \nthe subsidies if people are going to be required to use ethanol. It is \na mandate. We do not need the incentive or the encouragement anymore.\n  Clearly, this is about special interest money influence, and I will \nbe that specific because the environmental benefits, especially to an \narea such as mine, have not been demonstrated. At least the point is \nmade by an agency of my State that it would actually degrade the air \nquality of some parts of the State--in fact, pull them out of \ncompliance with the Clean Air Act, and yet\n\n[[Page S7214]]\n\nthe mandate would be imposed at the same time we continue to provide \nthis subsidy. Something is drastically amiss here.\n  There is an old phrase, ``Follow the money,'' so maybe that is what \nwe should do here. Let's take a look at the money part of this issue.\n  Currently, refiners use approximately 1.7 billion gallons of ethanol \nannually, and the underlying provision would increase that to 5 billion \ngallons annually by the year 2012.\n  There is no question that gasoline prices would increase, based on \ndata from the Energy Information Administration. It has been estimated \nthat the increase in gas prices caused by this mandate could be between \n$6.7 billion and $8 billion a year. So that is the price we as a \ncountry, as consumers of this product, will be paying simply to enrich \nthe people who produce the product.\n  Arizonans will, according to this estimate, be paying on average 7.6 \ncents more per gallon of gas. Is that fair, Mr. President?\n  I speak very plainly about the subsidies to the ethanol industry. \nAccording to the Congressional Research Service--this is an unbiased \nsource--the ethanol and corn industries have received more than $29 \nbillion in subsidies since 1996 and could receive another $26 billion \nmore over the next 5 years.\n  CBO, another unbiased source, has a different estimate for a \ndifferent time period. They have estimated, based on a review of S. \n791, the basis of the underlying amendment we are debating, $2.3 \nbillion just between the years 2004 and 2008.\n  We also know there is an impact on the highway trust fund because \nevery gallon of gas containing ethanol--10-percent blend--gets a 5.3-\ncent subsidy in the form of reduced gas taxes. This amounts to a 53-\ncent-per-gallon ethanol subsidy to the industry at the expense of the \nhighway trust fund, and the Energy Information Administration has \nestimated that this will reduce the annual gasoline excise tax \ncollections by an average of $892 million between the years 2006 and \n2020.\n  Again, my State is a donor State already. Arizonans send $1 in taxes \nto the Federal Government and for highway transportation-related needs \nreceives in return only 90.5 cents. So to the extent total revenues to \nthe fund are reduced, the Arizona highway program will obviously be \nsignificantly impacted.\n  There are a lot of general points that I could discuss. There are \ndisputes between authorities on the subject of whether or not it takes \nmore to produce a gallon of ethanol than the gallon actually contains \nin terms of Btu content; in other words, do you actually have a net \nloss in net energy value. There are disputes about that. Some \nexperts say about 29 percent more energy is used to produce a gallon of \nethanol than the energy in a gallon of ethanol. The National Corn \nGrowers Association, not exactly an unbiased source, disagrees with \nthat. I do not know where the truth lies. Clearly, it seems to me the \nscience is at best in dispute.\n\n  In any event, we would all have to agree that taking into account all \ncosts, not just the energy cost, that clearly it costs a great deal to \nproduce a gallon of ethanol or they would not need the subsidy which \nCongress has generously provided for its production.\n  I have already talked about the environmental benefits being \nquestionable. It is not just my own State environmental agency but also \na National Research Council report found that oxygenates have little or \nno impact on ozone formation, and there are a lot of refineries that \nclaim they can actually produce similar environmental gains without the \nuse of oxygenates. In fact, that is what we are going to have to do in \nArizona because we cannot use MTBE, and we would hope not to have to \nuse the ethanol, as a result of which we would have to find a different \nblend and would be committed to doing that.\n  It seems to me the ethanol industry, which enjoys this 5.2-cent-per-\ngallon exemption on the ethanol blend, or gasohol, from the 18.4-cents-\nper-gallon Federal excise tax on motor fuels, with the resulting \nmandate that the Congress is going to impose for the increase in the \nnumber of gallons used, would no longer need to be supported by this \nsubsidy, which, as I said, works out to be 52 to 53 cents per gallon \nfor pure ethanol.\n  The General Accounting Office estimates the tax exemption has \ndeprived the highway trust fund--a slightly different number than I \ngave before--of between $7.5 billion and $11 billion over the 22 years \nit has been in place. This is a very costly subsidy and would be a very \ncostly mandate.\n  Because the underlying amendment is costly, is not necessary, is \ncontradictory with the subsidies that are already provided, and because \nthe amendment of the Senator from California would simply provide the \nopportunity for States that would be adversely affected by this mandate \nto deal with their pollution problems in some other way--remember, they \nstill have to comply with the Clean Air Act; nobody is exempting \nanybody from the Clean Air Act; they simply have to find a different \nway to comply--it seems to me it would be appropriate for us to support \nthe amendment of the Senator from California and allow States to tailor \ntheir blends to the unique situation in their particular States.\n  Everybody would still have to meet the Clean Air Act but we could \neach do so in a way that best suits our individual purposes. For that \nreason, I hope my colleagues will support the amendment of the Senator \nfrom California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. McCAIN are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise to speak on behalf of the \nethanol amendment and to comment upon several of the remarks that were \nmade by my colleagues.\n  One of the items that was mentioned by the junior Senator from \nArizona was the issue of subsidy. I think it is important we clarify \nthe fact that, yes, ethanol has been subsidized over the years, but the \nFederal ethanol program was established following the OPEC oil \nembargoes of the 1970s.\n  I am old enough to remember the long lines in 1973. At that stage of \nthe game, we were only about 34 percent reliant on foreign oil. Of \ncourse, we all know today we are 58 percent reliant on foreign oil.\n  So when the ethanol subsidy came in place and the program was \nestablished, we had a dangerous dependence on imported oil. That was \none of the reasons they did it. As an alternative to petroleum, ethanol \ndirectly displaces imported oil and reduces tailpipe emissions while \nhelping to bolster the domestic economy. Yet today, as I just said, we \nimport more petroleum than ever before with rising crude oil prices and \nincreasing international instability.\n  Incentives for production and use of domestic ethanol are critical; \nthat is, we can rely upon ethanol. We cannot rely upon imported oil.\n  I think it is really important for all of us to recognize the fact \nthat we have subsidized the oil industry substantially since the early \n1900s. Some may not believe this, but the oil industry started out in \nthe State of Ohio. It was called Standard Oil. Today we continue to \nsubsidize the oil industry. In fact, according to the General \nAccounting Office, in an October 2000 report, the oil industry has \nreceived over $130 billion in tax incentives just in the past 30 years, \ndwarfing the roughly $11 billion provided for renewable fuels.\n  Here is an interesting fact: During this time, the U.S. oil \nproduction has plummeted while annual U.S. ethanol production has grown \nby over 2 billion gallons. The point is, when we got into the issue of \nsubsidizing ethanol, we were in very bad shape in terms of our reliance \non foreign oil. Since that time, we have made substantial progress.\n\n  During the same period of time, if you want to pit one industry over \nthe other, we have seen our dependence on foreign oil grow despite the \nsubsidy we have provided to the oil industry.\n  There is also the suggestion that the ethanol mandate will largely \nbenefit producers, not farmers. According to\n\n[[Page S7215]]\n\nthe U.S. Department of Agriculture, ethanol production raises the price \nof corn by 30 to 50 percent nationwide. This is an average of 5 to 10 \ncents additional premium in the areas that supply ethanol plants. Both \nof these numbers apply to all corn, not just corn sold to ethanol \nplants. Given a billion bushel corn crop, it adds between $3 and $5 \nbillion to farm income every year. There is no question, ethanol is \ngood for our farmers. Additionally, farmers own nearly 40 percent of \nthe ethanol industry, and that is growing. These farmer owners realize \nvalue-added benefits from their investments.\n  A chart was referenced by the Senator from California about the fact \nwe are relying on Archer Daniels Midland for 46 percent of our ethanol. \nThe fact is it is now down to 32 percent. The real growth in producing \nethanol is from ethanol plants financed by the agricultural community \nin the United States.\n  Finally, every major farm organization supports the fuels agreement, \nincluding, but not limited to, the following: American Farm Bureau \nFederation, the National Farmers Union, National Corn Growers \nAssociation, American Corn Growers, National Grain Sorghum Producers \nand American Soybean Association.\n  Now, we have some concern about what impact does this industry have \non the National Treasury, our general fund. Both the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture and the Congressional Budget Office have recognized the \nbenefit of the investment in the ethanol program on the overall health \nof the Nation's economy. Recently, the USDA stated the ethanol program \nwould decrease farm program payments by $3 billion per year. In its \nanalysis of this amendment, CBO stated the provision would reduce \ndirect spending by $2 billion during 2005 to 2013, certainly a partial \noffset to any subsidy given to the ethanol industry.\n  Tripling the use of renewable fuels over the next decade will reduce \nour national trade deficit by $34 billion. Our trade deficit is at an \nall-time high. A lot of that trade deficit has to do with importing \noil. It will increase the U.S. gross domestic product by $156 billion \nby 2012 and create more than 214,000 new jobs. It will expand household \nincome by an additional $51.7 billion, and it will save taxpayers $2 \nbillion annually in reduced government subsidies due to the creation of \nnew markets for corn.\n  We see a tremendous economic benefit to this ethanol industry in our \ncountry. That is why we are working so hard to have this amendment \nincluded in the Energy bill.\n  In addition to its importance in becoming more self-reliant in terms \nof imported oil, also in terms of our economy, ethanol helps our \nenvironment. This bill provides strong antibacksliding provisions that \nprohibit refiners from producing gasoline that increases emissions. \nOnce the oxygenate requirements are removed, a Governor can also \npetition EPA for a waiver of the ethanol requirement based \non supporting documentation that the ethanol waiver will increase \nemissions that contribute to air pollution in an area of the State. \nThis is something that was not mentioned by the junior Senator from \nArizona in his presentation. The fact is, if ethanol is such a big \nenvironmental problem in the State of Arizona, the Governor of Arizona \ncan petition that they be exempt from the mandate provision. That is \nincluded in our amendment.\n\n  Last year, the ethanol industry also worked with EPA on the discovery \nand containment of the emissions from ethanol facilities. Consent \ndecrees have been filed by the Justice Department in record time, and \ncompliance by the ethanol industry has been cited as a model.\n  The fuels agreement we are asking Members to support will benefit the \nenvironment in a number of ways. It reduces tailpipe emission of carbon \nmonoxide, VOCs, and fine particulates, and phases down MTBE over 4 \nyears to address our ground water contamination problem. It provides \nfor one grade of summertime Federal RFG, which is more stringent. It \nincreases the benefits from the Federal RFG program on air toxin \nreduction. It provides States in the ozone transport region enhanced \nopportunity to participate in the RFG program. And it includes \nprovisions that require EPA to conduct a study of the effects on public \nhealth, air quality, and water resources of increased use of MTBEs. We \nhave tried to cover everything in this amendment.\n  The amendments to opt out of this program are unnecessary and \nunwarranted.\n  The fuels agreement contained in this amendment that passed the \nSenate last year includes the establishment of a renewable fuel \nstandard and will provide for greater refinery flexibility in the fuels \nmarketplace than the existing Clean Air Act oxygenate requirement. It \ndoes not require that a single gallon of renewable fuels be used in any \nparticular State or region; rather, the requirement is on the refiners. \nThe RFS will allow much greater flexibility in the work of oxygenates, \nwhich should reduce the chances that localized supply disruption of \ngasoline or oxygenates will result in retail supply shortages.\n  The additional flexibility provided by the RFS credit trading \nprovisions will be a lower cost to refiners and, thus, consumers. The \ncredit trading system will ensure that renewable fuels are used when \nand where most cost effective, which is why we have the credit and \ntrading provisions. In California, we need to emphasize this.\n  By the way, California is the area where the junior Senator from \nArizona says they are going to have to rely upon getting their ethanol \nblend gasoline. Nearly all the refiners, the people who provide the \ngasoline to the State of Arizona, have switched from MTBE to ethanol in \nadvance of the State's MTBE phaseout deadline of January 1. The results \ncan only be described as seamless. There have been no ethanol \nshortages, transportation delays, or logistical problems associated \nwith the increased use of ethanol in the State of California. In fact, \naccording to an April 2003 California Energy Commission report, the \ntransition to ethanol which began in January 2003 ``is progressing \nwithout any major problems.''\n  We need to emphasize that. This is not going to discombobulate \ndelivery of the gasoline in California or New York or other places that \npeople say it will cause a problem. The Energy Commission of California \nsays it is progressing without any major problems. Today, approximately \n65 percent of all California gasoline is blended with ethanol. It is \nestimated that 80 percent of the fuel will contain ethanol by this \nsummer. They are moving ahead. Only 100 million gallons of ethanol were \nused in the State last year. California refiners will use between 600 \nand 700 million gallons of ethanol in 2003. There is not any reason to \nopt out because of the fact that blended gasoline will not be available \nto these States.\n  This legislation is the result of a great deal of work and compromise \non the part of many Members of the Senate working with a variety of \norganizations.\n  I would like to remind my colleagues of the organizations that \nsupport this. It is unusual, in terms of the diverse groups \nrepresented. It is supported by the American Petroleum Institute. There \nhas been some talk that the oil industry does not support it. The fact \nis, the American Petroleum Institute is supportive; of course, the \nRenewable Fuels Association; the Northeast States for Coordinated Air \nUse Management. Again, there is an area of the country that could be \naffected by it, and they like the compromise that has been put \ntogether.\n  We are talking about environmental concerns. The American Lung \nAssociation is supportive of this ethanol amendment. The U.S. Chamber \nof Commerce is certainly concerned about the impact this would have on \nthe economy of the United States. The Union of Concerned Scientists, \nagain, a very forthright, outspoken environmental organization that, on \nmany occasions, is very critical of legislation being promoted in the \nSenate, says: We like this agreement that has been entered into.\n  The Environmental and Energy Studies Institute; the Governors' \nEthanol Coalition; General Motors. Here is one that I think is really \nimportant for some of my colleagues who cannot make up their mind with \nregard to some of the amendments we are going to get to this ethanol \namendment, and that is that the Governors of both California and New \nYork support this compromise, and, of course, all the major \nagricultural organizations in the United States.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this ethanol amendment and defeat \nsome of\n\n[[Page S7216]]\n\nthe amendments that they are going to have an opportunity to vote on \nlater on this afternoon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, first, I compliment my colleagues, the \nchairman and ranking member of the Energy Committee, for doing such an \nincredible job on an Energy bill that is so needed in this great \ncountry. For the last 25 years, I think we have really begun to see the \ngrowth in our Nation and recognized the need for a modernization of our \nenergy policy in this country. I think these Senators have done an \nexcellent job in bringing together a diversity of issues, certainly in \nrecognizing the need for renewable fuels, in looking at how we can work \nwith cleaner burning fuels, the diversity of energy sources and \nresources that we can use in this great Nation. I applaud them for \ntheir hard work and diligence in that.\n  It is so important in our State. In Arkansas, both as a consumer as \nwell as producer of energy, and certainly in terms of the rural nature \nof our State, so much of what is in this bill is going to be very \nproductive for what we want to see happening, not only in the State of \nArkansas but across this great Nation in new and innovative energy \npolicy.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 1308\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I also would like to talk about \nsomething that has been on the minds of many of my colleagues as well \nas others across this great land. After we finished the growth package \nthe week before we took our break, I had many concerns about what we \nwere doing in that growth package and what we were trying to do, what \nsupposedly was our objective in terms of stimulating the economy. I \nthink it is so important to recognize the reasons why we wanted to \nstimulate our economy in this country. I think that really is to move \nforward the growth of this great Nation.\n  I think we need look no further than the American family if we want \nto understand why we want to stimulate growth in this great Nation to \nstimulate the economy. That is why I introduced the Working Taxpayer \nFairness Restoration Act. I offered this bill on behalf of nearly 12 \nmillion children who were left behind when President Bush signed the \n2003 tax bill. There were many of us who were very anxious to make sure \nwe had a fairness in that stimulus package and in that tax bill; that \nthere was a balance between fiscal responsibility and tax relief that \nwould be available to all families.\n  I have introduced the bill with many of my good friends, including \nSenators Snowe, Warner, Jeffords, Rockefeller, Collins, Reed, Bingaman, \nLandrieu, Johnson, Harkin, Kennedy, Pryor, Breaux, Edwards, Clinton, \nCorzine, Durbin, Sarbanes, Kerry, Lieberman, Schumer, Lautenberg, \nMikulski, Reid, Graham of Florida, Baucus, Leahy, Nelson of Florida, \nNelson of Nebraska, Levin, Carper, Hollings, Biden, Specter, Cantwell, \nDaschle, Stabenow, Dodd, Conrad, Voinovich, Akaka, Dorgan, Kohl, \nChafee, Feinstein, and Boxer.\n  This bill would restore a provision left on the cutting room floor \nwhen the House and Senate leaders finalized the conference report on \nthe tax cut.\n  Our bill will restore the advanced refundability of the child tax \ncredit. My friend from Maine, Senator Olympia Snowe, and I have worked \nsince 2001 to ensure all working families benefit from the child tax \ncredit. We worked very hard to ensure in the 2001 tax cut that the \nchild tax credit was refundable.\n  During the Finance Committee deliberations on this year's tax bill, I \nsuccessfully offered an amendment that would have advanced the \nrefundability of the child tax credit. Regrettably, that provision was \ndropped in conference.\n  Really, unless we pass this bill we have introduced soon, families \nwith incomes between $10,500 and $26,625 will not get that $400 check \nthat will be mailed in July as part of the 2003 tax bill. Since nearly \nhalf of the taxpayers in Arkansas have an adjusted gross income of less \nthan $20,000, Arkansas families are among the hardest hit by this \nomission in the new tax law.\n  Consider this: The base pay for a private in the military, serving in \nIraq, is just under $16,000 per year. The average Arkansas firefighter \nmakes between $22,000 and $25,000 a year. Many of those enlisted men \nand women, who could be given a few days' notice before being shipped \noff to war, and those firefighters who could get no more than just a \nfew minutes' notice before rushing into a terrorist attack--they all \nhave families, or many of them do. They work hard to support their \nfamilies and to protect us. Yet they got left out when negotiators \nshook hands over that final tax bill.\n\n  I was not in the room during those negotiations in the dark of night, \nand I understand very few of my colleagues were. But we are here today. \nWe are all here in the Senate, working today, united, hopefully, in our \neffort to fight for these working families.\n  Advancing the refundable portion of the child credit to cover these \nfamilies will cost only $3.5 billion--just 1 percent of the entire cost \nof that tax bill. This measure had strong bipartisan support in the \nSenate, I am proud to say. I was proud to play a leading role to expand \nthe child tax credit in the Senate bill. I am glad to have bipartisan \nsupport in my efforts on the bill that we have introduced to restore \nthis provision.\n  We will pay for this tax relief for working families by shutting down \nsome of the Enron-related tax shelters. This pay-for was included in \nthe Senate version of the 2003 tax bill that has already received the \nblessing of the majority of the Senate Members. Especially as our \nNation contends with a sluggish economy, we should ensure that everyone \nbenefits from the tax cut. After all, buying blue jeans for \nschoolchildren, washing powder for the laundry, or tires for the car \ncosts just as much for a family making $20,000 a year as it does for a \nfamily making $100,000 a year. If we want to get our economy back on \ntrack, we need to make sure we are putting money into the pockets of \nconsumers who will spend it.\n  This is not about partisanship. It is not about who is going to win \nhere or lose here today or in the next coming days. That is certainly \nevidenced by the cosponsorship of this bill. What this is about is \ndoing what is right for the families who may need a little extra help, \nfamilies who are working hard, day in and day out, playing by the \nrules, bringing home a paycheck and trying to raise their children the \nbest way they know how: with good values and good examples.\n  We should fix this problem--not in the future, not next year, not \nsometime down the road. We need to fix this and correct this \ninconsistency immediately. We have an opportunity to do what is right \non behalf of the working men and women in this country who are working \nhard, creating a face for this Nation in the next 20 years.\n  What is our Nation going to look like in the next 20 years? What are \nthe values of the leaders of tomorrow? These faces and these values are \nin the children we are raising today. It is not too much for this body, \nor the coequal body of the House, to say the time is right, to put our \nmoney where our mouth is, to give these hard-working families the \nopportunity to get a little extra--a little extra of the incredible \namount they pay into the system, a little bit extra to raise those \nchildren the best way they know how.\n  I started by saying the initiative to stimulate the economy in this \ncountry was an initiative, I think, based on what we all wanted to \nachieve: Not just to stimulate the economy but to strengthen our \nNation. And, once again, we have the opportunity, and we need to look \nno further than the faces of our children and the workers of the \nAmerican family in order to be able to do that.\n\n  Let us make these American families our priority today.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to calendar No. 52, \nH.R. 1308, a bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to end \ncertain abusive tax practices; that the Lincoln substitute amendment, \nwhich is at the desk and is a modified version of S. 1162, a bill to \namend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to accelerate the increase in \nthe refundability of the child tax credit, be considered and agreed to; \nthat the bill H.R. 1308, as amended, be read three times, passed, and \nthe motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, without intervening \naction or debate, on behalf of working American families.\n\n[[Page S7217]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I ask \nunanimous consent that the request be modified so that all after the \nenacting clause of H.R. 1308 be stricken, and the text of the Grassley \namendment regarding the child tax credit be inserted in lieu thereof; \nprovided further that the bill then be read a third time and passed and \nthe motion to reconsider laid upon the table.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, with all due respect to my colleague, I \nreserve the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Yes. I object.\n  I would like to comment. I think I know what the chairman is doing. I \nwould like to comment that we did provide pay-for in our bill. My \nconcern for what he has offered is that it is going to add another $90 \nbillion or $80 billion to unpaid debt in this country, for which I \ndon't believe there is a pay-for.\n  I respectfully object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard to the modification.\n  Is there objection to the request?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I would like to state what the Grassley \nproposal is.\n  It would make permanent the increase in the child tax credit. The \nbill signed by the President last week increases the credit from $600 \nto $1,000 for the next 2 years. The Grassley amendment would make the \nincrease permanent.\n  Second, it would eliminate the marriage penalty built into the \ncurrent child tax credit. The Grassley amendment increases the income \nphaseout for married couples filing jointly to twist the limit for \nsingle individuals filing alone. The Lincoln amendment fails to address \nthis inequity in the current formulation of the child tax credit.\n  Third, the amendment would create a uniform definition of a \n``child.'' This language is identical to the legislation introduced by \nSenators Grassley and Baucus. This change reduces from five to one the \nnumber of definitions of a ``child'' in the Tax Code, which will \nsimplify part of the code that will directly affect working families.\n  I might say to my good friend that I think she understands. I have \nthe greatest respect for her. And, obviously, she makes a case today \nnot only for herself but for many Senators and for many who voted with \nher in the days preceding as this legislation worked its way through \nhere and through the conference in the House.\n\n  It is the responsibility of the Senator from New Mexico to respond in \nbehalf of the majority, and I have done so. In doing so, I have offered \na counterproposal. Obviously, it is significantly different than the \none the distinguished Senator from Arkansas offered; nonetheless, a \nvery significant proposal. I thank her for her generosity.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I thank the chairman and my good friend, \nwho is a diligent worker on behalf of children. I know his concern for \nthe children of this country. I would like to express to him that in \nthe counterproposal that has been offered, it was not my intent to look \nfor an attempt or an excuse to reopen the tax package or to spend an \nadditional hundred billion dollars. I simply felt very compelled--that \nwith a small portion of this bill that could be rectified to make sure \nthese working families in America could get the same benefit from this \ntax bill that everybody else will on July 1--to think this was an easy \nopportunity for us to do that. We had a pay-for that was reasonable and \nsomething that the rest of the Senate had already agreed to and that \nSenators probably felt very comfortable with. It was simply an \nopportunity to express to those families that we certainly believed \nthey were a priority and that we could support them in this effort.\n  I appreciate the remarks of the Senator very much. I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me speak very briefly and indicate \nmy strong support for the Senator from Arkansas and her effort.\n  I think clearly we need to address this major failing of the \npreviously passed tax bill, and we need to do so in a way that is \nfiscally responsible. That is exactly what the Senator from Arkansas \nhas proposed--to find a way to pay for the refundability of the child \ntax credit. That is what she proposed earlier in the bill. That is what \nthe Senate agreed to earlier in the bill. That is clearly what we ought \nto do at this point. I regret that we were not able to do that this \nafternoon. But I hope the opportunity to do so will recur at some point \nin the near future and we can, once again, do what we believe should be \ndone to try to bring more equity to that tax package which was passed \nand signed by the President.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, it is my understanding that a vote will \noccur at 4:30; that there are 10 minutes prior thereto for debate on \nthe first amendment equally divided into 5 minutes each for those \nproponents and opponents of that amendment. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Parliamentary inquiry: What is the title of the first \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The first amendment is amendment No. 843 \noffered by the Senator from California, the purpose of which is to \noffer an ethanol mandate renewable fuel program to be suspended \ntemporarily if the mandate is harmful to the environment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I trust the Senator from California will \nbe here if she desires to debate it.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                      Amendments Nos. 843 and 844\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I know we will be voting at 4:30 on the \nFeinstein amendments. Both amendments attempt to provide waivers to the \nStates from the renewable fuels standard. There are several points to \nbe made. I made some of them this morning. But in case my colleagues \nhave not had the opportunity to evaluate the amendments or consider the \nconcerns raised by many of us with regard to the amendments, I thought \nit would be appropriate for me to say a couple of words again now.\n  First of all, with regard to ethanol utilization, the State of \nCalifornia is currently using ethanol in 65 percent of all the fuel it \nis marketing within the State. That is expected to go up to 80 percent \nthis summer. The Department of Energy in California has said there has \nbeen absolutely no difficulty in the integration of ethanol from a \ntransportation point of view, a storage point of view, an environmental \npoint of view, or a cost point of view.\n  So that would be first. Why have a waiver when there is no problem? \nThe problem does not exist. In fact, studies have shown--that I pointed \nout this morning, one by the Department of Energy Information, one by \nthe Department of Energy in California--that have said there is \nabsolutely no connection between increases in the price paid for \ngasoline and the use of ethanol. So from a cost point of view in \nparticular, there certainly isn't any need for a waiver.\n  Secondly, and perhaps far more importantly, this legislation provides \nthat there is no mandate on the States. There isn't one requirement \nwithin the bill that says a State must use ethanol as part of its \nrequirement under the law. That does not exist. The requirement is on \nrefiners, not on the States. And the refiners are given wide latitude \nto make their decisions based on where it is appropriately marketable \nand not on any predesign with regard to the market itself.\n  We are not dictating to any oil company that that 65 percent now \nbeing used in California be used as a result of a legal requirement. \nThat does not exist. We are simply saying: Look, we will let the oil \ncompanies and the refiners make up their own minds. And\n\n[[Page S7218]]\n\nwith the credit trading system, the job is made all the easier.\n  I would also say that if worse comes to worst, we have said: Look, if \nall else fails, there is absolutely no reason why a State cannot apply \nfor a waiver under the new law. Senator Feinstein and others have \nsuggested, well, they have applied for waivers in the past and have \nbeen turned down. I hasten again to add for those who may be confused \nby this, she is talking about the current law. In part, what we are \ndoing now is amending the law, removing the oxygenate requirement, \nphasing out methyl tertiary butyl ether, MTBE, and providing an \nopportunity for States to get out from under requirements of the old \nlaw while at the same time coming up with a way with which our country \ncan reduce its dependence on foreign sources, can find ways with which \nto clean up the air, and can do as much as possible to find markets for \nagricultural products within our own States and country. That is, in \nessence, what this bill provides.\n  So I simply say, Mr. President, as well intended as the Senator from \nCalifornia is, there is absolutely no reason why this waiver is \nnecessary. They have one in the bill. They have the credit trading \nsystem in the bill. There isn't any requirement for a State to mandate \nthe use of ethanol in this bill.\n  And, finally, it is working as we have predicted it would, certainly \nin those States where the markets have been allowed to work. \nCalifornia, as I said, now expects 80 percent of their fuel to \nincorporate ethanol through the summer. So it is yet another one of \nthese constant myths that has to be destroyed and dealt with as we \nconsider the many allegations about what it is we are trying to do.\n  Very simply, we are saying to the country, to the refiners, to \npetroleum marketers in particular: We are going to give you as much \nflexibility as you could possibly hope to have. And that is exactly \nwhat this legislation does.\n  Having said that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to support the \nsecond-degree amendment I offered this morning to the pending first-\ndegree ethanol mandate that would provide authority to the \nAdministrator of the EPA to waive the ethanol mandate if a State or a \nregion does not need it to meet the requirements of the Clean Air Act.\n  In the pending first-degree ethanol mandate, there is waiver \nlanguage, and that waiver language allows the Administrator of the EPA \nto waive the ethanol mandate if it would severely harm the economy or \nenvironment of a State, a region, or the United States.\n  I believe the EPA Administrator should also have the ability to waive \nthe mandate if a State can show that it can meet the Clean Air Act \nstandards without having to use ethanol. I think that is very important \nbecause all the refiners in my State tell me that if we allow them \nflexibility, they can, through the reformulated model of our gasoline, \nfor the most part, meet Clean Air Act standards without this mandate. \nThey may have to use some ethanol--and they are using ethanol now \nbecause there is a 2-percent oxygenate requirement--they may have to \nuse some ethanol at certain times of the year in certain areas of the \nState, but they do not need to use the amount of ethanol that this \nlegislation forces them--forces them, Mr. President--to use to meet the \nClean Air Act standards.\n  This mandate forces California to use over 2.5 billion gallons of \nethanol over 8 years that the State does not need.\n  On this chart, the red shows the forced use of ethanol. The blue \nshows the ethanol we would use in certain markets during certain \nseasons to meet Clean Air Act standards. As one can see, there is a \nhuge differential between the red and the blue areas.\n  We use this amount shown in blue and do not use the rest of the \nethanol which is shown in red which we have to pay for anyway. That is \na wealth transfer, if you will. In the outer years, it most certainly \nis going to mean an increased price of gasoline at the pump for \nconsumers.\n  All this amendment does is add to the waiver provision one other \npossibility for waiver, and that is, if a State can show that it does \nnot need to use all of this extra ethanol to the EPA, the EPA can then \nwaive the mandate. What could make better sense? Why would anyone \noppose this as a matter of public policy? Why would any public policy \nforce use and force costs on a consumer and transfer wealth to another \narea of the country when it is not necessary to do so? That is the crux \nof my argument. We do not need to use it. This chart clearly shows it.\n  If we look at another chart, we will see that we are forced to \ntransport a lot of ethanol to get it out to California; that the big \nproduction of ethanol is in the Midwest in what is called PADD II. Mr. \nPresident, 2.27 billion gallons of ethanol are made in this area. The \nentire West makes maybe 10 million gallons of ethanol. Therefore, all \nof this has to be moved not by fuel line but by barge, by truck, by \nboat, by some other way, and increases costs. That is the reason for \nthe waiver. If we can show that we can meet Clean Air Act standards, \nEPA can give those States a waiver.\n  I thank the Chair. I gather my time is up. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am prepared to vote. Do I have to \nyield back time?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I ask for the yeas and nays, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  Time is yielded back.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield back any time I have in opposition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the vote may occur at this \ntime. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 843. The clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I announce that the Senator from Missouri (Mr. Bond) \nis necessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nEdwards), the Senator Florida (Mr. Graham), the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry), and the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. \nLieberman) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that if present and voting, the Senator from \nFlorida (Mr. Graham) and the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry) \nwould each vote ``nay''.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 35, nays 60, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 203 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--35\n\n     Akaka\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Cantwell\n     Clinton\n     Collins\n     Corzine\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feinstein\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hollings\n     Hutchison\n     Inouye\n     Kennedy\n     Kyl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     McCain\n     Murray\n     Nickles\n     Reed\n     Santorum\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Specter\n     Sununu\n     Thomas\n     Warner\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--60\n\n     Alexander\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Conrad\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham (SC)\n     Grassley\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Levin\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Talent\n     Voinovich\n\n                             NOT VOTING--5\n\n     Bond\n     Edwards\n     Graham (FL)\n     Kerry\n     Lieberman\n  The amendment (No. 843) was rejected.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  (The foregoing tally has been changed to reflect the above order.)\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 844\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are now 4 minutes evenly divided. Who \nyields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Can we have order, Mr. President? I understand the \nSenator from California has 2 minutes. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I will just use a minute and then cede \nsome of the remaining minute to the Senator from Arizona, if I might.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, this amendment would allow a Governor \nof a State to opt into the ethanol program. Both Alaska and Hawaii have \nbeen able to become exempted from the ethanol mandate. The question \nthis presents for many of us is this: If a Governor of a State believes \nthe program is cost effective, believes it is going to clean up their \nenvironment, believes it is all of the things the ethanol proponents \nsay it is, then surely that Governor will opt in.\n  But if a Governor of a State, depending upon geographical location, \ninfrastructure for delivery, or science about the product, might decide \nnot to opt into the program, that Governor would have that opportunity. \nThis amendment is cosponsored by Senators Nickles, McCain, Kyl, Gregg, \nWyden, Leahy, Schumer, Reed, Sununu, Kennedy, and Clinton.\n  I thank them for their support and yield the remainder of my time to \nthe Senator from Arizona.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, can we have order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let's make it clear that every State still \nhas to comply with the Clean Air Act. The question is how they each \nchoose to do so. In Arizona, the Department of Environmental Quality, \nthe department of the State that is required to cause the State to be \nin compliance, says this mandate will actually cause two of our larger \ncommunities, Yuma and Tucson, to be in noncompliance with the ozone \nstandard during the summer months. Each State can meet the requirements \nin the ways they deem best under the amendment of the Senator from \nCalifornia. Let's not mandate a one-size-fits-all--oh, excuse me, \nexcept for Alaska and Hawaii--for every State. Give the Governors who \nare responsible people the ability to decide whether this is the best \nway for their State to meet the Clean Air Act standards.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, can we have order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, this amendment is based on a \nmisconception. The misconception is that somehow there is a mandate to \nbegin with. There is no mandate for the States under this bill.\n  There is a requirement that refiners find a way to reach the goals \nthat we set out in the legislation overall, both in energy as well as \nthe ethanol itself, but there is no requirement that States meet some \nstandard with regard to utilization of ethanol. And there is also an \noption for the States to opt out if they find the circumstances \ndescribed by the distinguished Senator from Arizona would ever come \nabout. States have the right to opt out, even though there is no \nparticular mandate to opt into the program to begin with. This is a \nrefiners obligation, not a State obligation.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, might I say, if you are for an ethanol \nprogram for the Nation, then you can't vote for this amendment.\n  If this amendment passes, there is no American ethanol program as we \nhave been speaking of it in terms of reducing the American dependence \non foreign oil. It becomes something different and not an American \nprogram to accomplish that purpose.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficent second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment, and the clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nEdwards), the Senator from Florida (Mr. Graham), the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry), and the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. \nLieberman) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nFlorida (Mr. Graham) and the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry) \nwould each vote ``nay.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole).

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                  Next Generation Lighting Initiative\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, will the manager of the legislation \nyield for a question?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Section 914 of this legislation directs the Secretary \nof Energy to establish a research and development program on solid-\nstate lighting. I worked on this provision with the Senator from New \nMexico, the chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, and \nI thought it would be useful to have his agreement that this program \nshould not be a traditional grant, contract or cooperative agreement \neffort. The Department of Energy, DOE, should administer this program \nin partnership with an alliance of solid-state lighting industry \npartners who will act to guide and evaluate the research.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I certainly concur. The alliance should be an inclusive \nbut well-defined group of companies active in the research, development \nand implementation of solid-state lighting technologies in the United \nStates. The DOE should select the alliance as quickly as possible, so \nas not to delay the program's implementation.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. If the Senator would yield for a further question, I \nwould like to know whether he also agrees that our intention is that \nacademia, national laboratories and other research organizations should \nperform most of the fundamental research, while commercial entities, \nespecially alliance companies, should perform most of the development \nand demonstration work. The selection of DOE laboratories should be \nbased on demonstrated technical accomplishments\n\n[[Page S7220]]\n\nin the field of solid-state lighting, particularly inorganic and \norganic light-emitting diodes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, again I completely agree with the \nSenator. I would also add that the intellectual property in section 914 \nis patterned after the Department of Energy's Solid State Energy \nConversion Alliance, or SECA. Under the SECA model, research and \ndevelopment qualifies for the ``exceptional circumstances'' provision \nof the Bayh-Dole Act. Inventors still retain rights to their \nintellectual property. Those alliance participants who are active in \nsolid-state lighting research and development will receive the first \noption to negotiate non-exclusive licenses and royalty payments to use \nthe invention.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank the Senator and would ask one final question. I \nthink he would agree that solid-state lighting is in its research \ninfancy. While it holds a promise to make white light illumination 10 \ntimes more efficient than today's light bulb, it is imperative that the \nDOE implement this program quickly, and transfer the pre-competitive \nresearch to industry, so that our country can retain its leadership \nposition in lighting--a field that Thomas Edison started.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I fully agree. The Senator serves as our ranking member \nand was instrumental in the adoption of this provision by our \ncommittee. I think we both expect that quick action by the Department \nof Energy will stimulate the private sector.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 845 to Amendment No. 539\n\n(Purpose: To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to accelerate the \n increase in the refundability of the child tax credit, and for other \n                               purposes)\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, on behalf of Senator Schumer and \nSenator Lincoln, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman], for Mrs. \n     Lincoln, proposes an amendment numbered 845 to amendment No. \n     539.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the majority whip be \nrecognized to speak for up to 5 minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. As in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request of the \nSenator from Virginia? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the distinguished assistant Democratic leader.\n  (The remarks of Mr. McCONNELL are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 539 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. FRIST. I now withdraw amendment No. 539.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/03/senate-section/article/S7220-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7220-S7226]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to a period for morning business with Senators permitted to \nspeak for up to 10 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, it is probably confusing to people who \nare watching this debate and discussion. I have just withdrawn the \nethanol amendment. As the minority leader suggested, my plans are to \nreintroduce that amendment at the earliest time feasible, likely first \nthing tomorrow morning.\n  What has just happened is that while we were talking about ethanol \nand energy, we were moved to the consideration of something which, yes, \ncould be related but it is on child tax credits, another issue that is \nimportant to the American people. What we have agreed to do is to \naddress that issue sometime in the very near future in a way that we \ncan consider alternatives to addressing the issues surrounding child \ntax credits.\n  The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I am disappointed that the underlying \namendment was withdrawn. That was an amendment offered by the \ndistinguished majority leader and myself. We are certainly going to be \ncoming back at the earliest possible time to continue the debate.\n  We have had a good debate today. A couple of amendments were offered \nto the amendment. This is a revenue bill, and certainly it is within \nthe right of the Senator from Arkansas to offer this amendment. This is \na key amendment that I hope we can address. We have begun discussions \nabout how we might address it over the course of the next couple of \ndays. It would be my hope that we could get a vote on this amendment, \nwhether it is freestanding or it is a part of the bill, and whatever \nour Republican colleagues may wish to offer as well, but we have to \nkeep moving along. The sooner we can dispose of this amendment, the \nsooner we can get to some of these other issues.\n  I hope we can reintroduce the ethanol amendment at the earliest \npossible date, continue the debate on that, finish it, and then move to \nthe other issues as we debate this bill.\n  So it is disappointing, but I hope we can regroup and begin again \ntomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I know the distinguished minority \nleader is disappointed, but not as much as the Senator from New Mexico. \nObviously, we have worked very hard on what we think is a very good \nEnergy bill. I think the United States deserves an Energy bill. I know \nthere are other issues. I have no quibble with other Senators who have \nissues that they think are of great importance, including tax issues, \nbut it is quite a surprise to see an issue of tax significance being \napplied to an Energy bill for the United States, although technically \none might call it a tax bill.\n  Nonetheless, where there is a will there is a way. If I understand \nit, there seems to be a will tonight that we will proceed to try to \niron out the difficulties between the parties as to the tax matters and \nthen tomorrow proceed with dispatch to get the ethanol amendment back \non board, and hopefully not have to go through the same amendments on \nethanol that we have already had, and proceed with the lining up of \nsome amendments on the Energy bill with which I understand the minority \nhas indicated a willingness to help. We will work on our side to do the \nsame.\n  Whatever time I had remaining under my 10 minutes, I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, it is probably confusing to people who \nare watching this debate and discussion. I have just withdrawn the \nethanol amendment. As the minority leader suggested, my plans are to \nreintroduce that amendment at the earliest time feasible, likely first \nthing tomorrow morning.\n  What has just happened is that while we were talking about ethanol \nand energy, we were moved to the consideration of something which, yes, \ncould be related but it is on child tax credits, another issue that is \nimportant to the American people. What we have agreed to do is to \naddress that issue sometime in the very near future in a way that we \ncan consider alternatives to addressing the issues surrounding child \ntax credits.\n  Child tax credits are a separate issue from ethanol and energy, a \nvery important issue, one we have been made aware of over the last \nseveral days that must be addressed. We will, of course, tonight, \nfigure out the best way to address that, and it will be done in the \nvery near future.\n  We will in all likelihood reintroduce the ethanol amendment, my \namendment, with the Democratic leader, early in the morning, and over \nthe course of tonight and this evening and early in the morning we \nwill, hopefully, have a series of amendments\n\n[[Page S7221]]\n\nlined up, and we will be able to move directly to ethanol, on energy, \nso that we can progress with this very important legislation, the \nEnergy bill, and this ethanol amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I do not quite understand why the \nethanol provision had to be pulled at this point. I know an amendment \nwas offered by my colleague and it deals with the child tax credit. It \nseems to me that could have been dispensed with rather quickly.\n  Let me talk for a minute about the child tax credit. First, I think \nthe ethanol provisions are very important. I am a member of the Energy \nand Natural Resources Committee and I want this Energy bill done. We \nhave a responsibility to get this moving and through here.\n  My colleague earlier today offered a unanimous consent request \ndealing with the child tax credit. It is not surprising to me that was \noffered. It probably would have been offered no matter what was before \nthe Senate. The reason for that is the announcement in recent days \nregarding the final conference report of the tax package. That told us \nwhat most know; that is, when those who wrote this package gathered in \na room someplace, there were not a lot of high-priced folks around \ntrying to encourage them to make sure all American children were \ntreated right with respect to the child tax credit.\n  Now we discover around 12 million children in this country are left \nout of this calculation of child tax credit. Why? Because some people \nallege--in fact, I heard it on a talk show today--some allege they do \nnot pay taxes. These people do not pay taxes, we are told. I don't know \nwhat they are thinking when they say that because these are taxpayers. \nThey work hard. Often these are the kinds of people who have to shower \nafter work, not before work. They work hard all day long and they pay \nmore in payroll taxes than they pay in income tax. And they are told by \nthis Senate, they are told by the Congress, they are told by talk show \nhosts, that they do not pay tax and therefore their kids do not count.\n\n  This Congress ought to be embarrassed when it hears news reports \nabout what the conference report said: By the way, we will provide a \nchild tax credit, but we will decide that 12 million children are left \nout. Why? Because their families earn between $10,000 and $26,000. \nSomehow the Congress has decided they do not work, or they do not \ncount, or they do not pay taxes. What a bunch of rubbish. What a bunch \nof nonsense. They deserve to be angry about this. We ought to be angry \nabout it. What kind of priority is this? I don't understand it at all.\n  The fact is, when they look back at our work 10 years from now, or \n100 years from now, the only thing historians will understand about us \nis what our value system was. What did we value? What did we think was \nimportant? What did we stand up for? Whose side were we on?\n  I watched this tax bill come together, and I waded through crowds of \npeople in the Capitol--basement, first floor, second floor. I guarantee \nI have never had to wade through a crowd of people who came to \nWashington, DC, to make sure we were playing fair for these 12 million \nchildren, to make sure we were standing up for the families who were \nearning $10,500 a year to $26,000 a year. I guarantee the hallways are \nnot filled with lobbyists being paid to represent their interests. I \nguarantee that.\n  But there are a lot of high-priced people around here protecting the \ninterests of the people at the upper end of the income scale. We did \nnot hear reports that they were being shortchanged, that children at \nthe upper end of the economic ladder were left out. No, they were taken \nright good care of. It is just the folks at the bottom. The folks at \nthe bottom, working people, people who work for $10,500 to $26,000 a \nyear, who have kids, trying to raise a family, they are the ones who \nknow about ``second''--second house, second mortgage, second shift, \nsecond job. And now they get second-hand treatment in the tax bill \nbecause they are told they don't count because they don't pay taxes. \nThe heck they do not pay taxes. Of course they pay taxes. They pay \npayroll taxes out of every single paycheck. I am offended that people \nsay people at the bottom of the economic ladder who find a paycheck \nless than their gross pay--and do you know why? Because they had taxes \ntaken out--I am offended when people say they are not taxpayers. I am \noffended when somehow it is told they do not deserve a tax cut like all \nother Americans because the fact that they pay payroll taxes is somehow \nless worthy than others who pay income taxes. One-half of the American \npeople pay higher payroll taxes than income tax and somehow this tax \nbill and those who worked on it decided they were not worthy, they were \nnot taxpayers. We will tell their 12 million children they do not \ncount. We will tell them it does not matter they have kids; they do not \nneed the tax credit.\n  There is something horribly wrong with that value system. It is not \nsurprising to me that someone comes to the floor--and if it had not \nbeen my colleague from Arkansas, it would have been one of a dozen \nothers today--to say this needs to be fixed--not tomorrow, not next \nweek, not next month. This ought to be fixed now. It ought not take an \nhour or a day. It ought to take 10 minutes for this Senate to \nunderstand its responsibility.\n  It's our responsibility to say to these people, the working people \nmaking $10,000 to $26,000 a year, trying to raise kids, working at a \njob, trying to do right, it is this Congress' responsibility to say to \nthem: You get the same tax cut as other Americans do. We provide the \nsame child tax credit for you as we provide for other Americans. You \npay taxes; we intend to recognize it. That is the responsibility of \nthis Senate.\n  I do not, for the life of me, understand why the offering of this \namendment persuades somebody to take down the amendment in the Energy \nbill. That is nonsense. We can pass this in 5 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. I wonder, does the Senator think any parents of these kids \nearning $10,000 to $26,000 a year, do they benefit from the cut in \ndividend payments from corporations? Do you think they benefit much \nfrom that, which was in the final version of the bill?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I say to my colleague from Nevada, there is no question, \nthese are not families who have dividends. These are not families who \ncollect a lot of interest. These are families who live paycheck to \npaycheck, trying to make a living, trying to do right by their kids, \ntrying to send their kids to good schools, trying to buy new clothes \nfor the kid to go to school in September. These are families trying to \nmake ends meet. They are always left out.\n  Frankly, I was surprised when I heard the President and others \nadvertising the tax bill, saying we support a child tax credit for \nAmerica's children--except he left out the colleagues of mine in the \nSenate who convened in a conference, without our participation. Nobody \nhere was invited to that conference. They wrote a bill that said it is \njust some American children; it is not children from those families who \nmake $10,000 to $26,000 a year because somehow they are not taxpayers.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator and I have been back in Washington for some \ntime. Right out these doors and various other places in the Capitol, \nthere are lobbyists, lobbyists who represent interests. Did the Senator \nrun into any lobbyists during consideration of the tax bill, the people \nwearing the Gucci shoes, delivered to the Capitol in limousines, \nlobbyists representing these people who were left out of the benefits \nof this tax bill passed 2 weeks ago?\n  Mr. DORGAN. To my colleague from Nevada, this hallway in the Capitol \noutside this Chamber is never ever populated by those who are paid to \nrepresent the interests of people who work at the bottom of the \neconomic ladder. They do not have full-time lobbyists crawling the \nHalls of Congress saying: By the way, give us a break on dividends; \ngive us a break on this issue or that issue.\n  No, unfortunately, it is these families, the families who work hard, \nat the bottom of the economic ladder, struggling every paycheck, trying \nto make ends meet, who get the short end of the stick every time you \nopen it up and look at the details.\n  I was surprised. I am a Lutheran Norwegian from North Dakota, kind of\n\n[[Page S7222]]\n\nstoic. I don't rise to the passion of some of my colleagues from New \nYork, but this makes me angry. That is just because it is fundamentally \nwrong. It talks about our character, that we decide we are going to \ngive some tax cuts, we are going to help some people out, but you know \nwhat. We will take a look at the top people and just give them a thick \nlayer of butter on their bread, but to the bottom people we will say \nyou don't count.\n\n  I will tell why. Mark my words. It is because those who wrote this \nbill believe that these are not taxpayers. Do you know why? Because \nsomebody who is making $15,000 a year, trying to raise four kids, \ntrying to patch up their car, seeing if they have enough money for new \nbrake linings, seeing if they can afford to put gas in next week--it is \nbecause those people are working at jobs where in most cases they are \nnot paying an income tax. But they are paying a payroll tax. The fact \nis, as a percent of their income, they pay a higher payroll tax than \nthe people at the upper end of the income scale. But when it comes time \nfor tax cuts, we have people sitting around a table here who say the \nonly people who pay taxes in America are those who pay income taxes. \nThat is pure nonsense and they ought to know better. There are \ntaxpayers in this country--in fact, more than half of the American \npeople pay higher payroll taxes than income taxes.\n  I frankly resent it when people say somebody at the bottom of the \neconomic ladder who pays payroll taxes is not an American taxpayer. If \nwe talk about trying to provide some stimulus to this economy of ours, \ntrying to provide some lift to this economy by giving people purchasing \npower--and that is what people talk about, providing some purchasing \npower--the American economic engine is the working families out there. \nProvide them with purchasing power with tax cuts and they will make the \neconomic engine purr--except they say those most likely to spend the \nchild tax credit, those who need it most, those at the bottom of the \neconomic ladder, working every single day, they should be left out and \nthey and their 12 million kids should not count.\n  I know why it happened. It is because we have colleagues in this \nChamber who say they are not taxpayers because they do not pay income \ntaxes. But they pay payroll taxes. We have colleagues who say payroll \ntaxes do not count; you are not a taxpayer.\n  I say that is sheer rubbish.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Will the Senator yield? Not only do they pay payroll \ntaxes, but they also pay sales tax when they buy new tires for that \nvehicle. They pay excise taxes. For people who live in States like ours \nwhich are predominantly rural, who have to drive great distances to \ntheir jobs, perhaps, when they pump gasoline, they are paying an excise \ntax. They pay property taxes and also they have to pay State income \ntaxes in some instances that are different from Federal income taxes.\n  The Senator from North Dakota makes some very good points. These are \ntaxpayers, hard-working people trying to raise a family, playing by the \nrules, and they are paying taxes.\n  I would like to ask the Senator, when was the last time you saw \nanybody offer up a tax cut on their sales tax or on their excise tax or \non the other taxes they do suffer from or that they are burdened with?\n  In other words, they are going to see all the tax increases but never \nsee any of the tax decreases or the tax benefits, if we do not look to \nmaking these child tax credits refundable to those 12 million children \nwho are out there, in these families who are continuing to pay not only \npayroll taxes but the sales taxes and the excise taxes and everything \nelse out there. The Senator makes an excellent point.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, Bob Wills of the Texas Playboys back in \nthe 1930s had a song with a verse that fits almost perfectly the \nphilosophy of those who wrote this bill and left out 12 million \nchildren.\n\n       The little bee sucks the blossom,\n       and the big bee gets the honey.\n       The little guy picks the cotton,\n       and the big guy gets the money.\n\n  It is a simple verse with an important lesson.\n  I followed a car the other day, an old car that had several children \nin it. They had the back bumper taped up but they had a bumper sticker \nthat said:\n\n       We fought the gas war and gas won.\n\n  I pulled up behind that car at a four-way stop sign and smiled to \nmyself because, you know, in circumstances like that, that family \ntrying to raise children, trying to keep an old car together, keep the \nbumper taped on, they figure everybody wins except them. They are \ntrying hard but they do not win; somehow they do not count. That \nimpression is always reinforced.\n  Yes, it is reinforced by Bob Wills in the Texas Playboys' verse, but \nit is reinforced every day in almost every way, especially in the \npolicies of this Chamber.\n  It is about values. This decision we make about tax cuts is about our \nvalue system. What do we think is important? What do we hold dear? What \nis our character about?\n  Let me yield the floor in a moment by simply saying Mr. Wallis, the \nConvenor of the Call To Renewal, a National Federation of Churches and \nfaith-based organizations, said:\n\n       The decision to drop child tax credits for America's \n     poorest families and children in favor of further tax cuts \n     for the rich is morally offensive.\n\n  My whole hope is we just do the right thing and do it quickly. We \nknow what the right thing is. It is not the right thing to say these 12 \nmillion children coming from the lower-income households, working \nhouseholds that are trying to make ends meet, that they should not \ncount with the child tax credit. We know that is wrong. If we know that \nis wrong, and in our heart all of us know that is wrong, then we know \nwhat is right. What is right is to say we will fix it and we will fix \nit now--not tomorrow, not next week, not next month, not after we have \nanother closed meeting and some secret conference--right now.\n  We can do that. That is our obligation, in my judgment, to a lot of \npeople in this country who deserve a break from us--taxpayers. Yes, \nthey are taxpayers who deserve some tax relief in the form of child tax \ncredits, taxpayers who were left out of the original bill but who will, \nwith the help of my colleagues, be put in, in this Senate.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield? I know my friend from Arkansas \nhas a very important meeting tonight, on behalf of her children, as it \nturns out. That is why she is the perfect person--I ask my friend, \nbefore he leaves the floor--to have brought this to us, because she \nknows children's needs very well, after raising the most beautiful twin \nkids who I happen to know personally and consider them friends.\n  I guess my question to my friend--and I will be brief on this \nquestion--is this: Does my friend have any idea--and I don't expect him \nto know--how many of these kids come from California? He talks about 12 \nmillion. Does he have any notion? I would say to my friend the answer \nis about 10 percent, about 10 percent of those kids.\n\n  I want to say to my friend that in this tax cut, if we do not fix it \nthe way my friend from Arkansas wants to fix it--and make no mistake, \nit could have been done already, all this rigmarole and parliamentary \nprocedure aside. In California people who make between $10,000 and \n$20,000, their average tax cut--does my friend have any idea what it \nmight be?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I don't think it is fair for the Senator from California \nto ask me questions she assumes I can't answer. The correct answer is \nno.\n  I have to leave the floor.\n  Let me ask consent that my colleague from California be recognized \nfor 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). Without objection, it is so \nordered. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will just take a minute. I would say it is important to \nnote that the people in California--and I assume this is true of the \npeople in the State of Tennessee, in the State of Arkansas, and perhaps \nNew York as well--the people who earn between $10,000 and $20,000 a \nyear, their average tax cut, which the President signed into law and \nmost Democrats voted against and most Republicans voted for--their \naverage tax cut is $7. These are working people. They are working. They \nare getting their hands dirty. They are keeping this country going. The \ntop elite few get hundreds of thousands back and these people get $7 a \nyear.\n\n[[Page S7223]]\n\n  If they have children, they are suffering, and all my friend from \nArkansas is saying is: Give these families a little fairness. They pay \npayroll taxes. They pay sales taxes. They have to live. And, by the \nway, giving them a check is going to stimulate this economy, not by \ngiving it to people like Leona Helmsley. She has everything she needs, \nthank you very much. I don't mean to pick on her particularly--but \nWarren Buffett has said it well himself. He doesn't need it. He has his \nkids and their kids and their future kids and their future kids \ncovered. He has every generation of Buffetts covered.\n  All we are doing is fighting for the people who need us the most.\n  I thank my friend from Arkansas for her courage and I want to say how \nmuch I support her and how much I am looking forward to voting in favor \nof her amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a statement?\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have been waiting to be recognized so I \ncould lay on this Record a compliment from me, the people of the State \nof Nevada, and the country for the brilliant statement the Senator made \nthis past Saturday on national radio. Rarely are the statements of the \nDemocrats who follow the President's weekly address picked up on the \nweekly and hourly news shows on the weekends. But the statement of the \nSenator from Arkansas was on the news all Saturday afternoon and all \nday Sunday, the reason being that it was such a timely statement the \nSenator made. It is obvious that it had a tremendous impact because we \nhave now heard from the majority. Paraphrasing the statements we have \nheard over here today: Yes, I guess we could have done a little better, \nand we will work something out so there will be some adjustments made \non how children in America are treated for tax purposes.\n  The Senator from Arkansas, I believe, can take much of the credit for \nour being here today. I told her personally, and I want to say \npublicly, she did a tremendous job representing the people of Nevada \nand the rest of the country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues from Nevada and \nCalifornia, and all of those who have come to the floor today to talk \nabout a very important issue.\n  I also compliment my colleague, Chairman Domenici, as well as the \nranking member, Senator Bingaman, for an incredible effort on our \nEnergy bill. There is no doubt that we need to address the energy needs \nof this country. We have for the last 25 years tried to modernize what \nwe do in energy. I think this bill is an incredibly important bill. I \nhope my amendment does not in any way diminish my support for what the \nchairman is doing in moving forward on the Energy bill. It is equally \nimportant to the working families of this great Nation that we address \nthose issues and look at ways of finding alternative fuels. Lord knows, \nfor those who pay the bill at home--the last time I paid my gas bill, \nit was enormously high, and for American families as well. When we look \nat an opportunity for an energy package, such as the chairman is \nbringing to us, we can certainly provide for our families some of their \ncapabilities to raise their family and be productive and strengthen \nthis great country in which we live.\n  I hope the chairman can understand. I noticed his disappointment as \nwe shifted off that amendment. I, too, was disappointed. I was \ndisappointed when this child credit bill was taken out of the bill in \nthe dark of the night--something that was important to so many families \nacross this Nation.\n  I also want to plead with those who are disappointed. We have shifted \noff only for a moment. We will return tomorrow and go vigorously at \nthis Energy bill. We only have a limited amount of time.\n\n  This tax package was signed into law. Many individuals will reap its \nbenefits come the first of July. But these 12 million children and \ntheir families will not get those benefits on July 1 unless we act \nquickly.\n  Certainly, we all know that when we have made mistakes, or when we \nhave done something which we think we could have done better, what do \nwe do? We immediately try to correct it. We don't sit around as it \nbecomes worse; we deal with that issue.\n  That is all I have been asking. This is an appropriate bill. It is a \nrevenue measure, and it is appropriate for me to bring up an amendment \nsuch as this.\n  Again, I don't want those who are working so hard and who have \ninvested so much time, as I have, too, on the Energy bill to think we \nare trying to divert any of that attention. We are simply trying to \ncorrect something that was done incorrectly.\n  We only have a limited amount of time. We want to make sure that \nthese families are given the same benefits and the same opportunities \nthis tax bill will give other Americans to infuse the economy, to help \ngrow the economy of this great country and, thus, strengthen our \nNation.\n  We talk about it time and time again. I hope as we reflect on these \nfamilies that we are actually trying to help those working families who \nare making between $10,500 and $26,625. These are the families who have \nbeen left out. I promise you, these people do pay taxes. Although they \nmay not fall into the category of paying enormous income taxes, think \nof the sales taxes they pay, think of the excise taxes they pay, think \nof the property taxes they may pay, and think of some of the State \ntaxes they may pay. They are paying taxes that are consuming a lot of \ntheir take-home pay. The problem we have is that they are trying \ndesperately and passionately to raise their children with the same \nvalues you and I have.\n  Why does it come to my attention? It is because of the time I have \nspent at home over the past 2 years shadowing welfare moms as we were \ndebating the welfare reform package, recognizing that it is as painful \nfor that welfare mother leaving a crying child at daycare as it is for \nme, a Senator.\n  This past spring break, I spent my time traveling around the State of \nArkansas visiting with workers. But then I, too, had to put on my hat \nand became a mom. I had to go and purchase blue jeans for my children. \nI had to buy tires for my car because my husband told me I had to--not \nbecause I wanted to spend my money there but because he told me it was \nfor the safety of our family. We needed new tires. I had to put a new \nbattery in my car--all of these things, none of which I did that was \nany different than any other working mom, no matter how much that \nworking mom makes.\n  All we are doing is asking for fairness in a package that is there to \nstimulate the economy. And for what reason? So we can strengthen our \ncountry. Not only do we want to give these families the capability to \nprovide for their children in a way that is going to make their \nchildren stronger Americans, smarter Americans, healthier Americans, \nmore safe Americans, but we want to give them the opportunity to \nparticipate in strengthening this country. This is not a handout. This \nis reaching a hand to our neighbors--those who are doing the same \nthings we are doing: Raising our children and strengthening our \nfamilies.\n  I plead with my colleagues. If we notice something that we haven't \ndone as best we could do it, let us fix it. Legislation is not a work \nof art; it is a work in progress.\n\n  A lot of my colleagues agree with me. I have 49 cosponsors since we \nintroduced the bill yesterday. Six of them are Republicans. It is \nbipartisan. I don't want this to be a partisan issue. I want this to be \na strengthening issue; that we in the Senate believe our working \nfamilies mean enough to us that we are going to share with them less \nthan 1 percent of this tax bill to help them raise their families, to \nbuy those tires, that washing powder.\n  I paid the bill for my children's lunch tab at the school. None of \nthese things is any different for these working families. We have to \nknow that. We as a Senate have to know that. We can't sit on the \npedestal and forget there are people out there trying to raise their \nfamilies. We talk about values. We talk about how we want these \nchildren to be healthy, we want them to be tomorrow's leaders, we want \nthem to have the compassion and the values that we talk about on the \nfloor of this Senate.\n  My friends, the best way we can teach them that is to walk our talk, \nto\n\n[[Page S7224]]\n\nlive these issues, to reach out to these working men and women of \nAmerica, and say that our families are not just important to us, but \nyour family is just as important; giving you this assistance to be the \nbest families you can possibly be is a priority for us, a priority \nenough that we are going to take a few minutes out of our busy day on \nthe floor of the Senate and correct something that we could have done \nbetter. We are going to take those few moments and make that happen. \nThen, we are going to resume our business with this Energy bill, and we \nare going to go back to our business of making the energy policy of \nthis country even better for you, too.\n  So I hope my colleagues will not take this incorrectly. This is not \nabout slowing down a train or missing the train stop. This is about \nreaching out to the working men and women of this country and saying: \nMy children are not only important to me, but your children are equally \nas important to me. And I want to do all that I can to give you the \nability to be the best parent and for you to have the best family that \nyou possibly can.\n  To affect the lives of 12 million children--12 million children of \nworking American families--is our opportunity this evening and \ntomorrow. These are people who are working. They are bringing home a \npaycheck, sometimes working two jobs, with both parents working \nperhaps. They have children.\n  I hope that as a body we will not miss that opportunity to move \nforward, show our great Nation--and other nations, too--that when we \ntalk about our children and their future, when we talk about the future \nof this country and the role we have to play globally in the future \nworkforce of America and the future leaders of America, that we do \nbelieve it is a priority, priority enough to stop for a few moments and \ncorrect something we could have done better.\n  Mr. President, I hope we will have multitudes of opportunities, as we \nmove forward, to make a lot of things better, but in this opportunity \nhere today and tomorrow as we begin to look at this issue and the bill \nthat I have introduced, and that many of my colleagues have joined me \nin, I hope they will continue to join me in moving forward and doing \nwhat we can for the 12 million children who live in the working \nfamilies of this great Nation, who have been left out of this tax \npackage, to give them the relief and the opportunity to help grow and \nstrengthen our country.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, before the Senator from Arkansas leaves--\nI know she has a meeting for her children--I want to add my accolades \nto that of my friends from Nevada and California. She has done a good \ndeed. The Bible says: The best thing to do is do a good deed for those \nwho are in need. She has done that, not only tonight but by her efforts \nin the Finance Committee and on the floor of the Senate because the \nchildren her amendment is aimed at are the ones who most need our help. \nSo I know she has to attend to her own children. I thank her. All of \nAmerica owes the Senator from Arkansas a debt of gratitude.\n  Mr. President, I am in full accord with what was said before about \nbringing this amendment to the floor. I do not like class warfare \narguments. And I certainly believe there are certain tax cuts for \npeople regardless of their income that stimulate the economy. I thought \na tax cut was appropriate. But what really burns me is this idea that \nis circulating now that the people left out of the tax bill do not pay \nincome taxes and, therefore, they are not entitled to a tax cut.\n  When you look at the working class, the people earning $10,000 to \n$26,000, they pay a much higher percentage of taxes than we do. They \npay tax on gasoline. They pay a payroll tax. They pay property taxes, \nif they own a home. They pay the property tax in a passthrough when the \nhome is rented. And their percentage is much higher than anybody \nelse's.\n  If you want to talk about class warfare, look at this Wall Street \nJournal editorial today, ``Even Luckier Duckies,'' talking about these \npeople who don't pay income taxes.\n  America, who would you rather be, a family with $22,000, paying no \nincome tax--but paying a payroll tax, paying a sales tax, paying tax on \ngasoline--or somebody worth $1 million, God bless them, who pays \n$150,000 or $70,000 or $100,000, or whatever they pay in income tax? \nGive us a break. Who is doing class warfare? Who? I would say this \neditorial is class warfare. It is misleading as well.\n  ``Luckier Duckies''? Well, if you want to define the world just by \nincome taxes, you can. But ask any American--not just those making \n$10,000 to $26,000--ask any American making $60,000 or $70,000--at \nleast from New York State--what is the tax they hate the most. It is \nnot the income tax. It is not even the sales tax. It is the property \ntax. Do we define those people as well off because they pay little in \nincome tax? Absolutely not. When a green dollar goes out of your hands \nfor a tax, it is a green dollar, and it can buy food and it can pay \nrent and it does not matter if it is an income tax or a sales tax or a \npayroll tax. And, of course, the payroll tax is a Federal tax.\n  So this is not fair. This argument that these folks pay no taxes is \nbogus. The argument that they pay no Federal taxes, if they are \nworking, is bogus. The idea that they escape the system scot-free while \nall the other wealthier people are struggling hard and paying money \ninto the Treasury is bogus. They generally pay, as has been said \nbefore, a greater percentage of their income as taxes than more well-\nto-do people.\n  I read an article the other day in the New York Times. It wasn't \nabout Federal taxes, but it took one census tract in Southern Queens in \nOzone Park. It was an average census tract. I read about a family. They \nwere talking about how tax increases in New York City--property tax \nincreases, the increase in subway fare, which is not a tax increase but \nhas the same effect--and the family was making, I believe it was \n$34,000. The mother worked in a beauty parlor and the father was a \njanitor at the library, and they had been saving $5 a week, I think it \nwas, to have a party for their child's communion.\n\n  They kept an envelope, and every week Mom put the $5 in. And she \nstarted several years before because she knew the date of her child's \ncommunion and she wanted to have enough money to have a party for the \nwhole family.\n  And now, because of these tax increases, because of the increase in \nthe subway fare, and because of a rent increase on the block--and \nanother family who was struggling was told by their landlord he would \nhave to increase the rent because the property tax increased--there \nwould be no party for the young child. It touched me. I wish every one \nof my colleagues could read that story.\n  This idea that people making $15,000 or $20,000 or $25,000 are \n``Lucky Ducks,'' that is so unfair. It is not right. I would argue that \nis class warfare. And there are many people in America who are \nstruggling and working hard. A lot of the people in the New York Times \narticle I am talking about are immigrants. There is a very mixed group \non those few blocks and around 101st Avenue in Ozone Park, NY. And \nevery one of our families probably came here poor as church mice. Mine \ndid. And every generation that starts here in America struggles. Mine \ndid. And probably yours did too, Mr. President, at some point in the \npast.\n  No one is saying they are oppressed or beleaguered. They are fine \npeople. They are the people who have made this country strong, along \nwith so many others. But to say they are in great shape in terms of the \nFederal tax law, given the payroll tax they pay, to say they are in \ngreat shape, despite all the other taxes they pay--sales tax and \nproperty taxes, whether they own their property, or if not, the \npassthroughs--is just not fair. It is not right. It is not the best of \nAmerica.\n  And I am not surprised this Chamber is empty. I am not surprised, \nduring the course of this whole debate, not a single Senator from the \nother side, with the exception of you, Mr. President, who might have \nbeen here not quite by choice----\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I am happy to yield to my colleague.\n  Mr. REID. How long did my friend serve in the House of \nRepresentatives?\n\n[[Page S7225]]\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Eighteen years.\n  Mr. REID. During that period of time, you served, as did I, with the \nnow majority leader in the House of Representatives, Mr. DeLay; is that \ntrue?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. It is true.\n  Mr. REID. Is the Senator aware of a statement made by the Republican \nmajority leader in the United States House of Representatives today \nthat said:\n\n       They had their chance. There is a lot of other things that \n     are more important than that. To me it is a little difficult \n     to give tax relief to people who don't pay income taxes.\n\n  Is the Senator aware that the majority leader of the House of \nRepresentatives has made this statement today?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I was not aware of it. I am glad my friend from Nevada \nhas brought it to my attention. It is what I was talking about. It is \nso unfair to say there were other things more important in the bill \nthan helping struggling families. Before my friend from Nevada came in, \nI was talking about an article in the New York Times about working \nfamilies, about the income level we are talking about, and how one \nfamily had been saving $5 in an envelope every week so that their son \nmight have a party at his holy communion for all his friends and \nfamily. And now they can't save that $5 anymore because taxes are going \nup and the costs are going up. To say that family is not struggling is \namazing.\n  I also am interested to hear my colleague say that there were other \nthings in the bill more important. If I heard him correctly, it seemed \nto me that the majority leader is not going to want to change this. Did \nhe say that as well?\n  Mr. REID. The majority leader said:\n\n       They had their chance. There is a lot of other things that \n     are more important than that. To me it is a little difficult \n     to give tax relief to people who don't pay income taxes.\n\n  It is clear, in answer to the Senator's question, that the majority \nleader in the House of Representatives, the person who controls what \ncomes and goes on that floor, has said that these people are out in the \ncold, for lack of a better description. They had their chance. As I \ndiscussed with the Senator from North Dakota, they had their chance. \nThese people who make from $10,000 to $26,000 a year, their chance is \nweighed with the problems of people who make much more money. They have \nno one representing them. As I discussed with the Senator from North \nDakota, there is no more populated area than the Halls of this Capitol \nBuilding when there is a tax bill up, with lobbyists who are looking \nfor a little niche to help the elite of the country.\n  These people are not the elite. These people we are trying to help \nare not elite. They are people who, as Senator Dorgan said, take \nshowers after work, not before. I am terribly disappointed that already \nthe person who sets the agenda for the Republican House of \nRepresentatives has said these people are finished. They had their \nchance.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I agree with my colleague. What is the purpose of saying \nthey are doing OK because they don't pay income taxes, when they are \npaying 7.5 percent of their check into the payroll tax? That is \nsomething most Americans support, but they are sure paying a lot. Right \nthen and there, when you have a $15,000-a-year job, and 7.5 percent \ncomes out for the payroll tax, that is food off the table. That is not \ngoing without the second vacation or buying some special gift for your \nwife, that is food off the table.\n  When you pay that dollar to the Federal Government, to the State \ngovernment, to the local government, do you think most Americans say it \ndoesn't count because it is not an income tax? It doesn't count to pay \nproperty taxes? It doesn't count to pay sales taxes? It doesn't count \nto pay excise taxes?\n  That is the kind of logic that is what I call outcome determinative. \nYou look at what you want to do: Help the wealthier classes for \nwhatever reason. And then you come up with the argument that income tax \nis the only tax that counts.\n\n  I wonder if my friend saw this editorial in the Wall Street Journal, \n``Even Luckier Duckies.'' Basically, it says this tax bill has made a \nlot of people very lucky because they won't have to pay income tax. And \nI asked my colleagues who were not here, how lucky do they think \nsomeone making $20,000 a year is compared to somebody making $200,000 \nor $2 million? Who would trade places? Who of those who make $200,000 \nor $2 million would trade places with the person who is making $20,000 \nso they could be a lucky duck and not pay income tax? Give me a break.\n  This is not America. This is not the generosity of spirit that this \ncountry has always shown. This is not the fairness that this country \nhas shown. As I mentioned earlier, I don't like the class warfare \narguments. I have supported tax cuts on individuals with some money to \nstimulate growth in the past and will continue to in the future. But to \nmake it seem as the majority leader did, as did the Wall Street Journal \neditorial page, which often reflects the majority leader's view, that \nsomeone making $20,000 is lucky because they don't pay income tax, and \nsomeone making $1 million is unlucky because they pay significant \nincome tax, that is turning logic, fairness, goodness of spirit, and \nhaving a good soul on its head.\n  I am happy to yield to my colleague.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator is aware that the tax bill, according to this \nWhite House, was passed to create jobs. The Senator has heard that?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I have indeed.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator is also aware of people like Warren Buffett who \nsaid: I am going to get hundreds of millions of dollars as a result of \nthis tax bill. I don't want the money. I don't need the money. I won't \ninvest the money. You have heard him say this?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I have indeed.\n  Mr. REID. Does the Senator acknowledge that any amount of money that \npeople who are making $10,000 to $26,000 a year receive, whether it is \n$100 or $500, will be immediately spent to buy things that create jobs \nfor people?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. The likelihood is much greater than somebody who is \ngiven the money who has a large income.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator is aware that here in Washington Members of the \nSenate every 6 years have to raise money talking to people to see if \nthey will help us; is he not?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. People have said I am aware of that.\n  Mr. REID. Does the Senator think many Senators will go to this group \nof people who make from $10,000 to $26,000 a year for campaign \ncontributions?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I doubt it. Forget the raising of the money. I worry \nthat they don't sit down and talk to somebody who is making that amount \nof money, ever. Yes, you may shake hands at a county fair. But how \nabout sitting in a living room and talking to the family who is making \n$27,000 and has dreams for their children and is struggling to do the \nbest for their kids and can't make ends meet? Again, that story about \nthe communion touched me. But there was another one in that New York \nTimes, an article about a family, a husband, wife, and two kids who \nwere going to have to move out of the house they always lived in \nbecause their landlord got an 18-percent increase in property tax and \nhe didn't want to pass it on. They were friends. It is a two-family \nhouse in a neighborhood in Queens. He didn't want to pass the property \ntax on as a raise in the rent for the people in the apartment. He had \nno choice because he couldn't make ends meet. He was not well off \neither.\n  Here is a family--they probably don't pay much, if any, income tax; I \ndon't remember exactly what their income was, probably in the $30,000 \nrange--who is going to have to move. They don't know where to find a \nplace to live. The kids will have to be uprooted and go to a different \nschool. Who in this Chamber would not choose to help that family out a \nlittle bit? I mean, create jobs? I have to tell you, a lot of these \nfamilies have jobs. They had jobs. The hard-working sort of bottom-of-\nthe-ladder jobs that they are starting out at. But not to give them a \nlittle break for their children because there is no room in the Tax \nCode and it is loaded with things for other people? Where are our \nvalues? Where are our priorities?\n  I wish every single person on both sides of the aisle would just go \nto three homes of someone making between $10,000 and $26,000 a year.\n  Spend a half hour with them and talk about their struggle and then \ncome back and say we could not reduce the top rate by a little bit \nless.\n  I thank my colleague from Nevada for his questions. I think he hit \nthe nail on the head. I am just saddened by this. If it were truly just \na mistake,\n\n[[Page S7226]]\n\nthen we would not have heard the language statement issued by Tom \nDeLay, the majority leader in the other body; if it were just a \nmistake, we would not have pulled an amendment that a lot of people \ncare about--I am glad it was pulled, myself, because I am not for it--\nbut it would not have just run off the floor. If it was a mistake, they \ncould say, great, the amendment of the Senator from Arkansas was pulled \nout at the last minute and we are going to put it back in and show that \nit was a mistake. But, no. There will be a lot of concerns, and maybe \nwe will get it and maybe we will not. I hope we will.\n  I am troubled--very troubled--by the fact that we have a view here \nthat those making $20,000, or $25,000, or $15,000 are lucky ducks \nbecause they don't pay income tax. That is a view some in this Chamber \nseem to have taken.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that today's Wall Street \nJournal editorial be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, June 3, 2003]\n\n                          Even Luckier Duckies\n\n       The new tax bill exempts another three million-plus low-\n     income workers from any federal tax liability whatsoever, so \n     you'd think the nation's class warriors would be pleased. But \n     instead we are all now being treated to their outrage because \n     the law doesn't go further and ``cut'' income taxes for those \n     who don't pay them.\n       This is the essence of the uproar over the shape of the \n     child-care tax credit. The tax bill the President signed last \n     week increases the per child federal income tax credit to \n     $1,000, up from the partially refundable $600 credit passed \n     in the 2001 tax bill. But Republican conferees decided that \n     the increase will not be paid out to those too poor to have \n     any tax liability to begin with.\n       Most Americans probably don't realize that it is possible \n     to cut taxes beyond zero. But then they don't live in \n     Washington, where politicians regularly demand that tax \n     credits be made ``refundable,'' which means that the \n     government writes a check to people whose income after \n     deductions is too low to owe any taxes. In more honest \n     precincts, this might even be called ``welfare.''\n       But among tax cut opponents it is a political spinning \n     opportunity. ``Simply unconscionable,'' says Presidential \n     hopeful John Kerry. The Democratic National Committee \n     declares that the ``Bush tax scheme leaves millions of \n     children out in the cold .  .  . one out of every six \n     children under the age of 17, families and children pushed \n     aside to make room for the massive tax cuts to the wealthy.''\n       Senator Olympia Snowe, the media's favorite Republican now \n     that John McCain isn't actively running for President, says \n     she is ``dismayed.'' ``I don't know why they would cut that \n     out of the bill,'' adds Senator Blanche Lincoln (D., Ark.). \n     Those last two remarks take chutzpah, because if either woman \n     had been willing to vote for the tax bill, a refundability \n     provision would have been in it.\n       Senator Lincoln introduced the idea in the Senate Finance \n     Committee, but then announced she wasn't going to vote for \n     the bill anyway. Ms. Snowe was also one of those, along with \n     Senator George Voinovich (R., Ohio), who insisted that the \n     bill's total ``cost''--in tax cuts and new spending--not \n     exceed $350 billion. Something had to give in House-Senate \n     conference to meet that dollar limit, and out went \n     refundability. The bill passed by a single Senate vote, with \n     Vice President Dick Cheney breaking the tie.\n       As it happens, the tax bill does a great deal for low-\n     income families even without the refundable child credit \n     addition. It expands the 10% income tax bracket, meaning that \n     workers can earn more before leaping into the 15% and 25% \n     brackets. This is a far better way to provide a tax cut than \n     is a refundable credit, because it lowers the high marginal \n     tax rate wall that these workers face as their credits phase \n     out at higher income levels.\n       There's also $10 billion in the bill earmarked for \n     Medicaid, the state-federal health insurance program for the \n     poor. And any family that actually has any remaining tax \n     liability benefits from the extra $400 in child tax credit.\n       More broadly, the critics want everyone to forget how \n     steeply progressive the tax code already is. IRS data \n     released late last year show that the top 1% of earners paid \n     37.4% of all federal income taxes in 2000. The top 5% paid \n     56.5% of federal taxes, and the top half of all earners paid \n     96.1%. In other words, even before President Bush started \n     slashing taxes on the poor by increasing the child tax credit \n     in 2001, the bottom 50% of filers had next to no federal \n     income tax liability.\n       But don't low-income workers have to cough up the payroll \n     tax? They certainly do, but don't forget that the federal \n     Earned Income Tax Credit was designed to offset payroll taxes \n     and is also ``refundable.'' In 2000, the EITC totaled $31.8 \n     billion for 19.2 million Americans, for an average credit of \n     $1,658. Some 86% of that went to workers who had little or no \n     income tax liability.\n       Republicans who just voted for the tax cut could be less \n     defensive and try to explain all of this. But instead too \n     many of them are heading for the tall grass, with Senate \n     Finance Chairman Chuck Grassley already promising to cave as \n     early as this week on the child tax credit. This is the kind \n     of political box Republicans walk into when they endorse tax \n     credits that favor one group over another. Democrats are \n     better at playing favorites.\n       We raised some hackles last year when we noted this growing \n     trend that more and more Americans paid little or no tax. \n     ``Lucky duckies,'' we called this non-taxpaying class at the \n     time. Notwithstanding liberal spinners, after this tax bill \n     they're even luckier.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/03/senate-section/article/S7226-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7226-S7227]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 BURMA\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, another day has passed in Burma and \nthe welfare and whereabouts of Aung San Suu Kyi and man of her \nsupporters remain a mystery. The State Peace and Development Council--\nthe rogue government there--claims that she is in a ``guest house'' in \nRangoon and is in good health. If this is the case, the government \nshould immediately allow foreign diplomats to meet with her.\n  The world's condemnation of the most recent murders and detentions in \nBurma has been swift. But words alone will not prevent the junta from \nassassinating more democracy activists in the days to come or detaining \nthose whose only crime is calling for freedom and justice.\n  The lesson of the past few days is that dialogue has failed in Burma. \nJapan and other countries that advocate engagement with the SPDC as a \nmeans of political change have nothing to show for their efforts but \nthe spilt blood of democrats and the re-arrest of Burma's greatest hope \nfor freedom.\n  Foreign governments must join in a full court press to determine the \nhealth and well-being of Suu Kyi and others arrested over the weekend. \nElected representatives in this body and the world's democracies must \ncome together and forge a response to the vicious assault on freedom \nthat continues in Burma. Our collective failure to do so will abandon \nthe people of Burma in time of their greatest need.\n  Burma's regional neighbors--Japan, China, Thailand, and the \nPhilippines, in particular--must understand the threats that a \nrepressive Burma will continue to pose the region. Among the junta's \ngreatest exports are drugs and HIV/AIDS--scourges that know no borders \nor boundaries. With terrorist threats in South Asia and Southeast Asia, \nthe junta will continue to pose chronic problems to countries trying to \nclose their borders to the trafficking of weapons, people, and \ncontraband.\n  In conclusion, it is past time to hold the SPDC accountable for the \nmany injustices it has inflicted upon the people of Burma. It is time \nfor regime change in Burma.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, every so often a clarifying moment in \ninternational affairs reminds us of the stakes involved in a particular \nconflict, and of our moral obligation to stand with those who risk \ntheir lives for the principles of freedom. The violent crackdown \nagainst Burmese democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi and her supporters \nover the weekend underscores the brutal and unreconstructed charter of \nBurma's dictatorship. The assault should remind democrats everywhere \nthat we must actively support her struggle to deliver the human rights \nand freedom of a people long denied them by an oppressive military \nregime.\n  The arrest of Aung San Suu Kyi following a coordinated, armed attack \nagainst her and her supporters is a reminder to the world that Burma's \nmilitary junta has neither legitimacy nor limits on its power to crush \npeaceful dissent. The junta insists it stepped in to restore order \nfollowing armed clashes between members of Suu Kyi's National League \nfor Democracy and unnamed opponents. In fact, the regime's forces had \nbeen harassing Suu Kyi and the NLD for months. The Junta's Union \nSolidarity Development Association orchestrated and staged last \nweekend's attack, killing at least 70 of her supporters and injuring \nSuu Kyi herself, perhaps seriously. Credible reports suggest that the \nregime's thugs targeted Suu Kyi personally. She is now being held \nincommunicado by Burmese military intelligence; her party offices have \nbeen closed; many of its activists are missing; and universities have \nbeen shut down. After having spent most of the last 14 years under\n\n[[Page S7227]]\n\nhouse arrest, Ms. Suu Kyi is, once again, a political prisoner.\n  Aung San Suu Kyi is one of the world's most courageous champions of \nfreedom. I join advocates of a free Burma everywhere in expressing \noutrage at her unwarranted detention and call for her immediate, \nunconditional release, and the freedom to travel and speak throughout \nher country.\n  Closing party offices, shuttering universities, and detaining Aung \nSan Suu Kyi and senior members of her party in the name of \n``protecting'' her demonstrate how estranged the junta is from its own \npeople, and how potent are Suu Kyi's appeals for democratic change in a \nnation that resoundingly endorsed her in democratic elections 13 years \nago.\n  The junta's decision to release her from house arrest a year ago, and \nto permit her to speak and travel within tightly circumscribed limits, \nappeared to reflect the generals' calculation that her popular appeal \nhad diminished, and that perhaps her fighting spirit had flagged. They \ncould not have been more wrong.\n  Aung San Suu Kyi remains the legitimately elected and overwhelmingly \npopular leader of her country. Even though she was under house arrest \nin 1990, her party captured 82 percent of the vote, shocking the \ngenerals. Neither the huge majority of the Burmese people who voted for \nthe NLD nor the international community have forgotten how Burma's \njunta rejected the election results, nor how the regime's forces \nmassacred its own people at a democratic rally 2 years earlier. We have \nnot forgotten the many political prisoners who remain in Burma's jails, \nor the repression Burma's people have endured for decades. The assault \non Burma's free political future at the hands of the regime last \nweekend has reminded us of what we already knew: the junta cannot \noversee the reform and opening of Burma, for it remains the biggest \nobstacle to the freedom and prosperity of the Burmese people. Burma \ncannot change as long as the junta rules, without restraint or remorse.\n\n  Despite these obvious truths, of which we have been reminded again \nthis week, some countries have chosen to pursue policies of political \nand commercial engagement with the government in Rangoon on the grounds \nthat working with and through the junta would have a more significant \nliberalizing effect than isolating and sanctioning it. ASEAN admitted \nBurma in 1997, Beijing has enjoyed warm relations with Rangoon, and \nmost countries trade with it: only the United States and Europe impose \nmild sanctions against the regime. Proponents of engagement pointed to \nthe nascent dialogue between Aung San Suu Kyi and the regime, and her \nrelease from house arrest last May, as indicators that perhaps external \ninfluence was having some beneficial effect on the dictatorship. But \nadvocates of engagement have little to show for it following last \nweekend's assault on the democrats.\n  Burma's junta must understand quite clearly that it will not enjoy \nbusiness as usual following its brutal attack on Aung San Suu Kyi and \nthe NLD. It is time for the international community to acknowledge that \nthe status quo serves nobody's interests except those of the regime: \nBurma's people suffer, its neighbors are embrassed, companies cannot do \nthe kind of business they would with a free and developing Burma, the \ndrug lords flourish in a vacuum of governance, and the situation inside \nthe country grows more unstable as the regime's misrule increasingly \nradicalizes and impoverishes its people.\n  No country or leader motivated by the Welfare of the Burmese people, \na desire for regional stability and prosperity, or concern for Burma's \nplace among nations can maintain that rule by the junta serves these \ninterests. I find it hard to believe that any democratic government \nwould stand by the junta as it takes Burma on a forced march back in \ntime. Yet this morning, when asked about the weekend's assault, the \nJapanses Foreign Minister denied that the situation in Burma was \ngetting worse, said progress is being made toward democratization, and \nannounced that Japan has no intention of changing its policy on Burma. \nShame on the Japanese. Music to the junta's ears, perhaps, but I \nbelieve friends of the Burmese people must take a radically different, \nand principled, approach to a problem that kind words will only \nexacerbate.\n  The world cannot stand by as the ruination of this country continues \nany farther. Free Burma's leaders, and her people, will remember which \nnations stood with them in their struggle against oppression, and which \nnations seemed to side with their oppressors.\n  American and international policy towards Burma should reflect our \nconviction that oppression and impunity must come to an end, and that \nthe regime must move towards a negotiated settlement with Aung San Suu \nKyi that grants her a leading and irreversible poticial role \nculminating in free and fair national elections. If it does not, the \nregime will not be able to manage the transition, when it does come, \nfor it will come without its consent.\n  I believe the United States should immediately expand the visa ban \nagainst Burmese officials to include all members of the Union \nSolidarity Development Association, which organized the attack against \nAung San Suu Kyi's delegation last weekend. The administration should \nalso immediately issue an executive order freezing the U.S. assets of \nBurmese leaders. U.N. special envoy Razali Ismail should not travel to \nBurma as planned this week unless he has assurances from the regime \nthat he will be able to meet with Aung San Suu Kyi.\n  Congress should promptly consider legislation banning Burmese imports \ninto the United States, and the administration should encourage the \nEuropean Union to back up its commitment to human rights in Burma with \nconcrete steps in this direction. The U.S. and the E.U. together \naccount for over 50 percent of Burma's exports and therefore enjoy \nconsiderable leverage against the regime. The United States alone \nabsorbs between 20 and 25 percent of Burma's exports. Consideration of \na U.S. import ban should help focus attention in Rangoon on the \nconsequences of flagrantly violating the human rights of the Burmese \npeople and their chosen leaders. In coordination with a new U.S. \ninitiative, an E.U. move in the direction of punitive trade sanctions \nwould make the regime's continuing repression difficult if not \nimpossible to sustain.\n  The junta's latest actions are a desperate attempt by a decaying \nregime to stall freedom's inevitable progress, in Burma and across \nAsia. They will fail as surely as Aung San Suu Kyi's campaign for a \nfree Burma will one day succeed.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/03/senate-section/article/S7227-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7227-S7228]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n              In Memoriam of Army Specialist Ryan P. Long\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, It is with a heavy heart that I request a \nfew moments today to reflect on the life of Army SP Ryan P. Long. In \nlife, Ryan epitomized the best of our country's brave men and women who \nfought to free the Iraqi people. He exhibited unwavering courage, \ndutiful service to his country, and above all else, honor. In the way \nhe lived his life--and how we remember him--Ryan reminds each of us how \ngood we can be.\n  Following in the footsteps of his father, grandfather and great-\ngrandfather, Ryan joined the Army in September of 1999. He was \nstationed at Fort Benning, GA with the A Company 3rd Battalion-75th \nRanger Regiment and was assigned to a special operations unit working \nin Iraq. He was on his third overseas deployment with the Ranger \nbattalion.\n  A lifelong resident of Seaford, DE, Ryan's passing has deeply \naffected the Sussex County community. Ryan was a remarkable and well-\nrespected young man. His friends and family remember him as an \nhonorable man with a free spirit. Ryan attended Seaford Elementary \nSchool and was a 1999 graduate of Seaford High School. Fun-loving and \noutgoing, he played on the soccer and golf teams and served as vice-\ncommander of the Navy Junior ROTC program at Seaford High School. He \nwas also actively involved in his Catholic church. In addition, Ryan \nenjoyed riding his motorcycles, snowboarding, and listening to music.\n  I rise today to commemorate Ryan, to celebrate his life, and to offer \nhis family our support. Ryan dedicated his life to serving our country \nand gave his life defending its values.\n\n[[Page S7228]]\n\n             In Memoriam of Marine Sergeant Brian McGinnis\n\n  Mr. President, I would like to set aside a few moments today to \nreflect on the life of Marine Sgt Brian McGinnis. Brian epitomized the \nbest of our country's brave men and women who fought to free Iraq and \nto secure a new democracy in the Middle East. He exhibited unwavering \ncourage, dutiful service to his country, and above all else, honor. In \nthe way he lived his life--and how we remember him--Brian reminds each \nof us how good we can be.\n  A Delawarean who dreamed of becoming a marine from a young age, he \nwrote on his application to Caravel Academy that he wanted to attend \nthe U.S. Naval Academy and become a Navy pilot. Brian's dream came true \nin 1998 in many respects when he joined the Marines. He subsequently \nwas assigned to Marine Light Attack Helicopter Squadron 169 based out \nof Marine Corps Air Station at Camp Pendleton, CA.\n  Raised in St. Georges, DE, and in neighboring New Jersey, Brian \nattended Caravel Academy and graduated from William Penn High School in \n1997. There he was a star wrestler and football player. It was at \nWilliam Penn that he met his wife of 4 years, Megan Mahoney McGinnis. \nMegan describes her husband as a great person with a good heart--``the \nbest there was!''\n  I rise today to commemorate Brian, to celebrate his life, and to \noffer his family our support and our deepest sympathy on their tragic \nloss.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/03/senate-section/article/S7228-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7228]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Act, a bill that would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence \nof any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred in Phoenix, \nAZ, on May 19, 2003. Avtar Chiera, a Sikh American, was seriously \nwounded after being shot twice. The 52-year-old truck driver was shot \nafter he parked his 18-wheeler. The suspects, who were riding in a red \npickup truck, yelled hateful comments. The FBI and Phoenix police \ndepartment are investigating the shooting as a hate crime.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/03/senate-section/article/S7228-2", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7228-S7229]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT\n\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, I realize it cannot be considered as part \nof the pending legislation, but I ask Senator Grassley to consider \nincluding a bill I have introduced, the Municipal Debt Refinancing Act, \nin future tax legislation. The Municipal Debt Refinancing Act would \npermit an additional advance refunding for bonds used to finance \ngovernmental facilities as part of the tax legislation to be considered \nby the Finance Committee. The Municipal Debt Refinancing Act would \npermit fiscally strapped State and local governments to take advantage \nof the current low market interest rates by refinancing their \noutstanding bonds an additional time. This proposal could translate \ninto millions of dollars in savings for states and localities across \nthe country. By requiring bond issuers to use the additional advance \nrefunding authority within the next 2 years, the legislation also \nguarantees the maximum near-term benefit.\n  Individuals and corporations who borrow money are free to refinance \nthese debts whenever the opportunity to borrow at a lower rate arises. \nState and local governments who issue tax-exempt bonds generally do not \nshare this freedom. States and localities are permitted to ``advance \nrefund'' outstanding bond issues only one time, or else they must wait \nuntil a pre-set date when interest rates have risen and the opportunity \nto garner savings has passed. But cost-saving refinancing opportunities \ntypically occur only when market interest rates fall below the rate on \nthe original bond issue. Issuers cannot effectively predict when this \nwill happen. By providing an additional advance funding, your \nlegislation would give issuers more flexibility to react to interest \nrate changes and manage their debt. This legislation would mean \nsignificant savings for State and local governments--many of which are \nin the midst of their worst fiscal crisis in memory--without raising \ntaxes or increasing spending.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I appreciate the Senator's work in this important area. \nIt is true that permitting States and localities to advance refund \ngovernmental bonds one additional time would provide important \nfinancial flexibility at a critical time. State and local governments \nacross the country are facing unprecedented fiscal crisis. Being able \nto refinance debt at a lower rate will clearly translate into important \nsavings for our Nation's cities, counties and states.\n  I assure the Senator this proposal will receive serious and thorough \nconsideration by the Finance Committee, which I chair, as we address \ntax legislation in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/03/senate-section/article/S7229-2", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7229]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              ANDREW HARIG\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to thank Mr. Andrew Harig for \nhis hard work on the Senate Finance Committee.\n  Andy was on the staff of the Finance Committee throughout most of the \n107th Congress. He was an integral part of the international trade \npolicy team which, among other things, worked hard to win passage of \nthe implementing legislation for the U.S.-Jordan Free Trade Agreement \nand the Trade Act of 2002.\n  In my estimation, last Congress was the most productive in at least a \ndecade on important international trade legislation. Last year, we \nfinally built a new bipartisan consensus that ended a deadlock that had \nfrozen progress on most new trade agreements for nearly a decade, \nfinally made some real progress on integrating labor and environmental \nissues into trade negotiations, and revamped the U.S. programs for \nworkers who lose their jobs because of trade.\n  In the press, the credit for these achievements was given to Senator \nGrassley, Representative Thomas, myself, and other Members of Congress. \nBut as is always the case, the achievements on trade could not have \nbeen made were it not for the contributions of people like Andy who \ntoil behind the scenes. Without their efforts there would be no \nlegislation passed.\n  In Andy's case, he cheerfully undertook one of the most thankless \ntasks on the Finance Committee's list of responsibilities--passage of \nthe Miscellaneous Tariff Bill. This legislation is made up of literally \ndozens of smaller bills that suspend collection of tariffs on products \nnot made in the United States and address other Customs issues.\n  Passage of this legislation requires a seemingly endless effort to \nanalyze the hundreds of bills submitted and eliminate those that are \ncontroversial or have too great a budgetary impact. It requires \ncoordinating with a half dozen administrative agencies, the U.S. \nInternational Trade Commission, the other House of Congress, and, of \ncourse, 100 Senate offices.\n  As I said, it is a largely thankless task, but one that is critical \nto hundreds of American companies and thousands of American workers. \nAndy Harig was the lead staff person on this legislation for the \nmajority and--together with his counterpart on the other side of the \naisle, Carrie Clarke--he did the lion's share of this work.\n  Unfortunately, the Senate was not able to pass this important \nlegislation last year, but Senator Grassley and I continue to work on \nthe bill, and I hope we can eventually win passage of it--either as a \nfree standing bill or as part of other legislation.\n  But whether we succeed or not, the Senate, the business community and \nI all owe Andrew Harig thanks for his efforts on the Miscellaneous \nTariff Bill and other international trade legislation.\n  Andy has decided to leave the Senate to pursue an opportunity in the \nprivate sector. I wish him all the best. Of course, the Senate will \ncontinue to work after Andy leaves, but I think it will be a bit poorer \nfor the loss of another hard-working staff person. Goodbye, Andy, and \ngood luck.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/03/senate-section/article/S7229-3", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7229]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     HONORING IOWA STUDENTS WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE WE THE PEOPLE: \n            THE CITIZEN AND THE CONSTITUTION NATIONAL FINALS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I will take a moment to congratulate the \nindividuals from Central Academy in Des Moines, IA who participated in \nthe We the People: The Citizen and the Constitution national finals in \nWashington, DC. This event is the culmination of extensive study by \nstudents throughout the country of the American system of \nconstitutional democracy. The students from Central Academy won the \nState competition in West Des Moines and thus were given the \ndistinction of representing Iowa in the national finals. I had the \nopportunity to meet with these students when they were in Washington \nand I am certainly proud to have had them representing the great State \nof Iowa. I am also pleased that my staff member, Aaron McKay, was able \nto be involved in this program as a judge for both the Iowa competition \nand the national finals as well as acting as a mentor for the team \ngoing into the finals. The We the People: The Citizen and the \nConstitution program, run by the Center for Civic Education with the \nhelp of Federal funding, provides an outstanding curriculum that \npromotes civic competence and responsibility among elementary and \nsecondary students. Students take away a solid understanding of the \norigin of American constitutional democracy as well as the contemporary \nrelevance of our founding documents and ideals. In short, it produces \nbetter citizens. In fact, I would like to personally recognize the \nCentral Academy students who participated in this program, Alexander \nBody, Alec Davis, Ainslee Ericson, Joanna Grillas, Brian Haroldson, \nDaren Ho, Meryl Houser, Jonathon Kent, Michael Larking, Conrad Lee, \nKyle McCord, Jasmine McDowell, Eleanore Neumann, Timothy Smith, Akili \nThomas, Sarah Wang, Kyle Wilkinson, Jay Williams and their teacher, \nHarvey Kimble. They can all be very proud of their knowledge and \naccomplishments. I look forward to next year's competition.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/03/senate-section/article/S7229-4", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7229-S7230]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               ON THE RETIREMENT OF DR. KAREN J. HARSHMAN\n\n Mrs. BOXER. I am very pleased to take a few moments to \nrecognize the many important accomplishments of Dr. Karen J. Harshman \nas she retires as superintendent of the Fontana Unified School \nDistrict. Dr. Harshman has led Fontana schools through a period of \nunprecedented growth and during a time of increased demands on schools, \nand has done so with great success.\n  Dr. Harshman began her career in education as a substitute teacher. \nSince that early assignment, she has been a teacher, coordinator, \nprincipal, director, and assistant superintendent. She also serves as \nan instructor at local college campuses, guiding new teachers and \nadministrators as they learn the educational ropes.\n  Since 1994, Dr. Harshman has lead the Fontana Unified School District \nas its\n\n[[Page S7230]]\n\nsuperintendent. During her tenure as superintendent, Fontana has seen \nphenomenal growth. Six schools have opened under her leadership, and \nthe district currently ranks 17th in size in the State of California. \nEducational excellence has become a more prominent emphasis during her \ntenure, and Dr. Harshman has focused the efforts of the district on \nimproving student performance through a variety of innovative programs \nknown throughout California and beyond.\n  Dr. Harshman's accomplishments are not limited to Fontana Unified \nSchool District or education. Soroptimist International of Baldy View \nrecently awarded her the Women Helping Women Award for bringing the \nAmerican Cancer Society Relay for Life to Fontana and for her work with \nbreast cancer survivors. Importantly, the award was also given for her \nlifelong work mentoring women. The Association of California School \nAdministrators selected her as the Region 12 Superintendent of the Year \nfor 2002. Dr. Harshman is also active in the Fontana Rotary Club, the \nFontana Chamber of Commerce, and the Chaffey College Foundation.\n  A portion of Dr. Harshman's biography reads that ``she looks forward \nto every single day knowing that she is involved in the most important \nwork on the planet.'' I invited all of my colleagues to join me in \ncommending Dr. Karen Harshman for her great leadership doing ``the most \nimportant work on the planet''--educating our children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/03/senate-section/article/S7230-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7230]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 NATIONAL CREATIVE ARTS THERAPIES WEEK\n\n Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, the process of using the arts \ntherapeutically to assist victims of illness, trauma, disability and \nother personal challenges, has historically been underrecognized as a \nvaluable treatment, yet the benefits of this treatment are far \nreaching. The creative arts therapies, comprising the fields of art \ntherapy, dance/movement therapy, drama therapy, music therapy, poetry \ntherapy and psychodrama, are disciplines that foster creative \nexpression to promote health, communication, self-awareness, emotional, \nsocial and cognitive functioning. I rise today, to proclaim National \nCreative Arts Therapies Week, June 1-7, 2003 as a time to recognize \nthis unique service.\n  Creative arts therapies have been practiced in the United States for \nover 50 years with people of all ages and problems. Such therapists \nwork in medical hospitals, rehabilitation centers, mental health \nfacilities, day treatment centers, nursing homes, schools, homeless \nshelters, correctional settings, and in private practice. Creative arts \ntherapists have helped people who have undergone trauma, loss, acute \nphysical and chronic illness, emotional disturbance, or struggle with \ndepression, retardation, development disabilities and addictions. The \ncontribution of creative arts therapists in the aftermath of 9/11, \nassisting victims and the bereaved through trauma treatment and the \nalleviation of post-traumatic stress, were invaluable.\n  I want to recognize and thank creative arts therapists in America who \nare assisting the most vulnerable in our society with valuable \ntherapeutic intervention. There are over 15,000 licensed clinicians who \nmeet high quality standards of graduate education and practice. Various \nStates, including New York, have additional licensure requirements, \nwhich protect patients from fraudulent practitioners and maintain the \nquality of care at the highest standard. These credentialed clinicians \nconstitute a vital force of mental health professionals in our country. \nHowever, many Americans are unable to access such services because \nawareness about their effectiveness and employment of such therapists \nis not sufficiently widespread.\n  The National Coalition of Creative Arts Therapies Associations is \ncollectively celebrating the history and status of their profession. \nThey will be showcasing workshops, presentations and exhibits \nthroughout the United States to inform the public, health care \npractitioners, insurers and legislators about therapeutic value and \nsignificance of this discipline.\n  I therefore proclaim National Creative Arts Therapies Week, June 1-7, \n2003 as a time to recognize the unique service provided by these \nclinicians. Further, I encourage my colleagues in Congress to support \nthe creative arts therapies fields and expand awareness of this form of \ntreatment. At this time of heightened sensitivity to maintaining mental \nhealth, we should recognize the creative arts therapies as a way to \nhelp those in distress through the power of the arts to heal.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/03/senate-section/article/S7230-2", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7230]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  FEINSTEIN-KENNEDY AMENDMENT TO THE FY2004 DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION BILL\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I submit into the record a \nstatement to clarify my position on the development of low yield \nnuclear weapons. Circumstances prevented me from voting last week on \nthe Feinstein-Kennedy amendment to the FY2004 defense authorization \nbill which would have struck any provisions that might permit research, \ndevelopment, testing, or deployment of low yield nuclear weapons. At \nthe time, my vote was announced as an ``aye'' in favor of a motion to \ntable the amendment. Through no fault of the distinguished Senator from \nNevada who announced my vote, if I had been here, I would have voted \n``nay,'' and supported the common sense proposal of the Senators from \nCalifornia and Massachusetts.\n  Last week, in a statement entered into the Record, I made clear my \nopposition to the development of low yield nuclear weapons, as well as \nthe robust nuclear earth penetrator. It is absurd to think the United \nStates will start development on a new generation of nuclear weapons at \nthe same moment we seek the world's support in an effort to halt the \nspread of nuclear weapons and technology.\n  Senator Feinstein and Senator Kennedy were correct. These weapons \ndon't make us safer. And I thank them for their continued leadership on \nthis vital issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/03/senate-section/article/S7230-3", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7230]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO MATT BOWLES\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to \nMatt Bowles for being selected as the State Winner of the 4-H Award for \nExcellence. Matt will enroll in the University of Kentucky on \nscholarship in the fall and is the son of Larry and Diana Bowles of \nMount Hermon, KY.\n  Matt's compassion for immigrants who struggle with language barriers \nled him to develop a community service project that helped his \ncommunity break down cultural barriers and welcome diversity. With this \nprogram Matt solicited the aid of advanced Spanish students at his high \nschool to help the local English as a Second Language tutoring program \nfor Hispanics.\n  This award is based upon the leadership, communication, and \norganizational work Kentucky 4-H members have done through a 4-H Honors \nprogram sponsored by the University of Kentucky Cooperative Extension \nService. Matt was selected by judges to be the recipient of this top \nprize because of the excellence he demonstrated through leadership in a \ncommunity service project.\n  The efforts of Matt Bowles should be emulated. Matt has set an \nexample that should be recognized by high school students throughout \nKentucky and across America. I am convinced that he will use his strong \nabilities to make a difference in our country. I thank the Senate for \nallowing me to recognize Matt and voice his praises for his Head, \nHeart, Hands, and Health.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/03/senate-section/article/S7230-4", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7230-S7231]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        A TRIBUTE TO OUR FRIEND\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President I rise today to pay tribute to \nand wish a happy birthday to one of my dearest friends, Louis Reich.\n  Louis was born on May 24, 1903 in Brooklyn, NY, the middle of three \nchildren. His sister Anne is now 102. By the time he was 15, Louis had \na job at a big law firm on Wall Street where he made 25 cents for a car \nfare and food. For lunch he ate at Max's Busy Bee where he could get a \nfrank, beans, waffles, ice cream and coffee for 15 cents. Those were \nthe days.\n  Everyday he would come up from Max's basement location and encounter \nmen standing in the middle of the street yelling up to people in four \nsurrounding buildings. These men were\n\n[[Page S7231]]\n\ncalled ``brokers'' and they were buying and selling stocks. In fact, \nLouis was witnessing the birth of the New York Curb Exchange. He was so \nentranced with the scene that he got a job as a runner paying $8 a \nweek. Wanting a way to make more money, he headed to Jerome B. Sullivan \n& Co., where he was hired as a clerk.\n  By the time he was 22, he was the head cashier at Sullivan making \n$100 a week plus bonus. Soon afterwards he formed the New York Curb \nCashiers Exchange and was elected president. In 1923, he was introduced \nto Kitty Hirshleifer by his closest friend Jerry Goldberg. Four years \nlater, Louis and Kitty were married. When Louis got his bonus from \nSullivan that month the company made him a partner and he spent his \nnewfound wealth on a trip to the coast, a new Cadillac and an apartment \nfor $125 a month. Not many apartments available at those rates in New \nYork today.\n  The crash came in 1929 and Louis was left nearly penniless. \nDemonstrating his adaptability he purchased a seat on the Curb Exchange \nwith his brother Al and his cousin Ernie. His salary was now $50 a \nweek. From 1933 to 1938 Louis became an arbitrageur. He sensed that the \nCanadian market was becoming competitive and through connections in \nCanada he started to urge companies to apply for listing on what used \nto be the Curb Exchange, but now known as the American Stock Exchange.\n  He formed a partnership with Moe Weiss which lasted for many years. \nAround 1955 Lou became a governor of the American Stock Exchange and \nchairman of the listing committee.\n  A few years later in 1959 I met Lou when his back-office manager saw \nan ad about a company who could process payrolls. It was a company I \nknow a little about, Automatic Data Processing. At that point I was the \ncompany's salesperson and Reich & Co. signed on. We became dear friends \never since.\n  I owe Lou a great deal because he really spread the word about ADP. \nHenry Taub worked to have ADP handle all of the back office operations. \nWithin a year ADP had a system to process securities transactions. \nToday, in large part thanks to Lou, ADP is one of the largest payroll \nand securities processing firms in the world.\n  Louis Reich is now 100 years old. He brings a wonderful history and \nan important legacy of leadership in one of the most important \nindustries we have. The investment and finance sector helped build this \ncountry's pre-eminence in the global economy to the point that it has \nbecome. He has many happy, exciting memories. The names he remembers \nfrom that bygone era--those who worked for him--and with him are too \nnumerous to mention here. And the one person who stood by him through \nit all--the one person who will be forever in his heart and who truly \nwould have enjoyed this day--his darling wife--Kitty, the one who he \nmisses most of all. They are all here in spirit and will never be \nforgotten. We wish him many more years that we can celebrate \ntogether.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/03/senate-section/article/S7231-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7231]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE CAPTURE OF ERIC ROBERT RUDOLPH\n\n Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I rise today to express pride and \nthanks for the excellent police work done by North Carolina law \nenforcement over the weekend, work that led to the capture of Eric \nRobert Rudolph, the alleged terrorist who had eluded capture for more \nthan 5 years.\n  I am particularly proud of the fact that two of North Carolina's \nfinest--Jeff Postell, a rookie officer in the Murphy Police Department \nand Cherokee County Sheriff's Deputy Sean Matthews--were responsible \nfor brining Rudolph in.\n  I can't say enough about these exemplary lawmen, who represent the \nbest that North Carolina and America have to offer--dedicated public \nservants risking their lives to make us safer. I will never forget the \npride I felt as I watched Officer Postell, squinting in the glare of \nunasked for limelight, modestly dismiss praise for his actions by \nstating, ``It was my job.''\n  His job, indeed. As it is the job of thousands and thousands of other \nfirst responders in North Carolina and throughout the country. Men and \nwomen who day in and day out put their lives on the line to ensure our \nsafety and ask so little in return. The least we can do for these brave \npublic servants is to show our support for their efforts in meaningful \nways. One of the most meaningful ways we can do this is to do more than \njust pay lip service to their efforts while cutting programs, funding, \nand benefits they so desperately need.\n  That is why it makes no sense that, instead of bolstering the efforts \nof our first responders, the administration is slashing the very \nprograms that we need to help ensure a strong homeland defense. Just \nlook at the COPS program--a program that has directly benefited the \nMurphy Police Department and Cherokee County law enforcement. Since it \nwas created as part of a 1994 crime bill, the COPS program has helped \ncommunities hire more than 116,000 police officers nationwide.\n  We all know how important and effective the COPS program is. So why \nis President Bush proposing only $164 million for the COPS program next \nyear, an 85 percent cut from the $1.1 billion that was spent in 2002? \nIt is just plain wrong to, on the one hand, praise, take credit for, \nthe fine work done by our local law enforcement day in and day out \nwhile, with the other hand, snatch away the funding that makes their \nwork possible.\n  Yes, Officer Postell was just doing his job. And thanks to him, we \ncan sleep a little easier. but not it is time for us to do our jobs. \nLet's give Officer Postell and his colleagues the tools they need to \nkeep doing the work we need and appreciate so much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/03/senate-section/article/S7231-2", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7231]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n IN RECOGNITION OF MICHELE PECINA, CALIFORNIA'S NATIONAL DISTINGUISHED \n                         PRINCIPAL OF THE YEAR\n\n Mrs. BOXER.

BOB WELLISCH\n\n Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I ask that the following three \ntributes honoring the life of the late Rev. Bob Wellisch, St. Paul, MN \nnative, priest for the Hmong Catholic community, and respected college \nprofessor, be printed in the Record.\n  The material follows.\n\n                 [From the Star Tribune, May 26, 2003]\n\n                           (By Nolan Zavoral)\n\n      The Rev. Robert Wellisch, Pastor to Twin Cities Hmong, Dies\n\n       The Rev. Robert Wellisch, who built bridges between the \n     Catholic establishment and the Twin Cities Hmong community, \n     died in a traffic accident Saturday night.\n       Wellisch, 62, was driving back alone to the Twin Cities \n     from Mankato when his car struck a horse on Hwy. 169, 4 miles \n     north of Le Sueur, and slid into a ditch, according to the \n     Minnesota Highway Patrol. Wellisch, who was wearing a seat \n     belt, died at the scene.\n       A St. Paul native and longtime English professor at the \n     University of St. Thomas, Wellisch was named chaplain for the \n     Twin Cities Hmong Catholic community in 1984 by then-\n     Archbishop John Roach. Eleven months ago, the present \n     archbishop. Harry Flynn, appointed him as pastor of the \n     largely Hmong parish of St. Vincent De Paul, in St. Paul's \n     Frogtown area.\n       About 20 people from the congregation's leadership gathered \n     informally Sunday at the church to mourn.\n       The Rev. Kevin McDonough, who oversees administration in \n     the Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis, joined them.\n\n[[Page S7232]]\n\n       ``One of the elderly Hmong ladies came up to me, and she \n     said, as it was translated to me, `We are like a family that \n     has lost its parent.' '' McDonough said.\n       ``Father Wellisch was a very quiet, unassuming guy, but it \n     was clear to the Hmong people that he had their interest at \n     heart.''\n       ``He loved the Hmong,'' said Michael Mikolajczak, chairman \n     of the St. Thomas English Department. He recalled attending a \n     Hmong fundraiser nine years ago with Wellisch.\n       ``They wound bits of yarn around his wrists in appreciation \n     of all he'd done,'' Mikolajczak said. ``Had it been I, I \n     would have cut [the yarn] off the next day.\n       ``He wore them for a whole week.''\n       Va Thai Lo, deacon and administrator at St. Vincent De \n     Paul, said in a St. Thomas news release that Wellisch ``would \n     go everywhere to assist (Hmong) families--to their homes, to \n     where they worked and to the hospitals.\n       ``This is a tragic loss for us.''\n       Among Wellisch's accomplishments at St. Vincent, McDonough \n     said, was to help administrators with budgeting.\n       ``He did a fine job of encouraging them along,'' McDonough \n     said. ``This year we had a very mature budgeting process.''\n       It was unclear what led Wellisch to dedicate much of his \n     life to the Hmong. The Rev. Ed Flahavan, a retired St. Paul \n     priest who keeps in touch with many local Catholic clergy, \n     said he thought that the Rev. Daniel Taillez--a French priest \n     who had once served in Vietnam--introduced Wellisch to that \n     segment of Southeast Asia's population.\n       Wellisch learned to say the mass in Hmong.\n       ``He even learned to preach in Hmong--he'd learned it that \n     well,'' said the Rev. James Reidy, a retired priest and \n     friend of Wellisch's. ``He had the ability to pick up \n     language very quickly,''\n       Wellisch is survived by three cousins. Funeral arrangements \n     are pending. He earned an undergraduate degree St. Thomas in \n     1962 and a master's degree and doctorate in English from the \n     University of Minnesota. He was ordained in 1969 and served \n     as an associate pastor at St. Mark's Catholic Church in St. \n     Paul until 1971, when he joined the St. Thomas faculty.\n       ``He was the kindest, gentlest, most supportive colleague \n     you could want, ``Mikolajczak said. ``He loved literature--\n     Victorian, mainly, but everything, really.\n       ``He'd teach the modern tradition if I'd want. He'd teach \n     the classical tradition if I'd ask. He wasn't afraid to pitch \n     in.\n       ``He was a priest the lay faculty accepted as a colleague. \n     He claimed no special privileges because of his collar.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                            (By Casey Selix)\n\n                 [From the Pioneer Press, May 26, 2003]\n\n                     St. Paul Priest to Hmong Dies\n\n       Some St. Vincent de Paul parishioners would drive 100 miles \n     round-trip Sunday mornings to hear the Rev. Robert Wellisch \n     celebrate Mass in Hmong.\n       More than half of the members of the church in St. Paul \n     don't speak fluent English, so it means a lot to worship in \n     their native language, said Kou Ly, who translated the \n     priest's sermons into Hmong and coached him on pronunciation.\n       When Kou Ly and other parishioners arrived at church and \n     found locked doors Sunday morning, they started worrying and \n     praying.\n       About 10 p.m. Saturday, Wellisch died after his car hit a \n     stray horse on U.S. 169 in LeSueur County, causing him to \n     veer through the median and into a ditch, according to the \n     State Patrol. Wellisch, 62, who was wearing a seat belt, died \n     at the scene.\n       As one grieving Hmong elder told the Rev. Kevin McDonough \n     through a translator Sunday, ``We are like a family that has \n     lost its only parent.''\n       Besides appreciating his Hmong services, parishioners just \n     plain liked the priest, who cared enough to show up at their \n     children's birthday parties and other important social events \n     in the Hmong community.\n       ``He would do much more than a regular priest. . . . He was \n     so good-hearted,'' said Kou Ly, adding that Hmong-speaking \n     Catholic priests are a rarity.\n       It was Father Bob's good heart that took him to Mankato, \n     MN, on Saturday to attend a pre-confirmation retreat with \n     parish youth and their parents. And his good heart led him to \n     drive back alone late Saturday so he could celebrate Mass the \n     next morning with the rest of the flock. About 150 families \n     belong to the church.\n       ``It's a tragic loss at a number of levels,'' said \n     McDonough, vicar general of the Archdiocese of St. Paul and \n     Minneapolis. ``Father Bob Wellisch was one of those very \n     gentle souls that his brother priests had a great deal of \n     respect for. This is a real personal loss on the part of the \n     priests and the people he served. In the last 15 years, he \n     was in one way or another so critical to the development of \n     the Hmong Catholic community.''\n       Wellisch, a St. Paul native, also was a full-time associate \n     professor at the University of St. Thomas, where he was \n     considered an expert in Victorian literature and where he \n     taught in the Catholic studies department.\n       ``He so loved the literature and the discipline and he was \n     so kindly attentive to students that I have never heard a \n     complaint about him,'' said Michael Mikolajczak, chairman of \n     the English department. ``He was teaching a full load here \n     and then ministering to the Hmong community, and he didn't \n     stint on anything. He was just remarkably generous.''\n       St. Vincent de Paul Deacon Va Thai Lo had known Wellisch \n     for 20 years. ``He was very nice, and he loved all the people \n     very much. Any time our members called him, he would visit \n     them at their homes if they wanted--even go to their birthday \n     parties.''\n       Each morning, Wellisch would wake up at the St. Thomas \n     faculty residence and head to St. Vincent de Paul to \n     celebrate the daily Mass, Va Thai Lo said. Then he would \n     return to campus to teach. On weekends, he gave services at \n     the church in English and Hmong. In between, he tended to his \n     parishioners' needs.\n       The deacon recalls Wellisch once confiding that he might be \n     ``too old'' to learn the Hmong language.\n       Even so, Wellisch persevered--sometimes with amusing \n     results, said Kou Ly, who worked with Wellisch on \n     pronunciation.\n       ``He would pronounce the words funny,'' Kou Ly said. ``When \n     you mispronounce a word in Hmong it can mean a totally \n     different thing--such as the word for stick. If you vary the \n     tone a little it can mean blanket. We would just keep doing \n     it, and he would laugh about it.''\n       After Wellisch underwent heart bypass surgery a few years \n     ago, about 30 members of the Hmong community performed a \n     healing ceremony.\n       As they tied strings around his wrist, they expressed \n     wishes for good health and a long life for him. ``Culturally, \n     we believe that whatever we say will stay in that string,'' \n     Kou Ly said.\n       Though Hmong recommend that the strings remain in place for \n     three days, Wellisch wore his for longer than that, friends \n     recall.\n       Wellisch graduated from St. Paul's Cretin High School in \n     1958 and summa cum laude from St. Thomas in 1962 with a B.A. \n     in English. He received a master's degree and a Ph.D. in \n     English from the University of Minnesota. He was ordained by \n     the archdiocese in 1969 and served at St. Mark's in St. Paul, \n     the Cathedral of St. Paul, St. Paul's Priory and Holy Trinity \n     Catholic Church in South St. Paul.\n       In 1984 he was appointed chaplain for the Twin Cities Hmong \n     Catholic Community. He also was chaplain of the Hmong \n     American National Catholic Association. He became pastor at \n     St. Vincent de Paul last June.\n       Survivors include three cousins, Dale Bowen of Fridley, \n     Alice Bowen of Sioux Falls and Gretchen Myers of Cedar Falls, \n     Iowa.\n       Funeral services are pending.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From the Pioneer Press, May 31, 2003]\n\n                    Hmong Honor Life of Late Priest\n\n                           (By Stephen Scott)\n\n       As they followed the casket out the back of the sanctuary, \n     it was clear the Hmong men and women could scarcely let go of \n     their priest.\n       With the death of the Rev. Robert Wellisch, they felt as if \n     they'd lost a parent.\n       ``You can see by the pain in their eyes what a great priest \n     he was,'' Archbishop Harry Flynn said after Wellisch's \n     funeral Friday. ``There is such sadness in their faces. They \n     just keep saying to me, `Remember us. Remember us.' ''\n       Wellisch was the Roman Catholic chaplain to the Twin Cities \n     Hmong community since 1985. He learned their language so he \n     could say Mass for them. He attended their birthday parties, \n     visited their sick, and confirmed and married their children.\n       Now there is much that a deeply grieving Hmong community \n     cannot understand. Why now? Why a car accident? Why on a \n     church youth trip? Why a horse?\n       ``Right now, our people are very, very sad because of the \n     way he died,'' said Va Thai Lo, deacon at St. Vincent de Paul \n     Church in St. Paul, home to Hmong Catholics in the Twin \n     Cities.\n       Wellisch, 62, died last Saturday night when his car hit a \n     stray horse on U.S. 169 in LeSueur County. Wellisch was \n     returning from a confirmation retreat for St. Vincent's Hmong \n     youth in Mankato, Minn.\n       The Hmong Catholics share their grief with Wellisch's other \n     ``families''--faculty at the University of St. Thomas, where \n     he taught literature; the English-speaking Catholics who make \n     up a fourth of St. Vincent's parish; and three cousins who \n     survive him.\n       But in life, Wellisch made the Hmong community feel as if \n     he was all theirs.\n       ``His absence won't be just missed,'' said a letter from \n     parishioners in the back of the church. ``We have lost our \n     only parent. We are left as orphans who expect a parent that \n     would never return.''\n       The funeral Mass at St. Vincent's reflected the life of a \n     priest with a diverse calling.\n       One hundred priests and deacons processed to the hymn ``Los \n     Peb Los Cav Txog Tswv Ntuj.'' They recessed to Amazing \n     Grace.''\n       The youth choir sang Bryan Adams' ``I Will Always Return.'' \n     They followed with ``Khoom Plig Zoo,'' with lyrics they \n     adapted in memory of Wellisch. One phrase translates: ``When \n     we think of you our tears come out.''\n       The Rev. James Reidy's homily focused on Wellisch's life as \n     a professor. At his death, Wellisch worked full time at St. \n     Thomas in addition to serving as the priest at St. Vincent's.\n       ``He had a steady, tireless ministry to all he was called \n     to serve,'' Reidy said.\n       The Hmong especially have been tireless in their mourning. \n     Nearly 50 of them remained in the sanctuary all night after \n     Thursday's visitation, just to be near Wellisch's body.\n\n[[Page S7233]]\n\n       ``We watch over him and look over him,'' said Ah Thao, \n     whose daughter attended the retreat where Wellisch was last \n     seen alive. ``We don't want to leave him alone. We guard him \n     until he is buried.''\n       The community is anxious about what happens next.\n       ``It is too big of a scope to say right now,'' said Kou Ly, \n     a parishioner who helped Wellisch learn the Hmong language, \n     ``He's not replaceable.''\n       Va Thai Lo will continue to serve St. Vincent's as a \n     deacon, and various backup clergy will say Mass until an \n     interim pastor or permanent priest is appointed.\n       ``Whenever we needed him, he was there spiritually and \n     morally,'' Khamsy Yang said in a eulogy. ``We will still have \n     faith in God, who will bring us a new priest.''\n       The Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis also has \n     ministries dedicated to Hispanics, Vietnamese, Koreans, \n     Poles, Eritreans and American Indians.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/03/senate-section/article/S7233-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7233]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/03/senate-section/article/S7233-2", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7233]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/03/senate-section/article/S7233-3", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7233]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:16 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate.\n\n       H.R. 1465.

A bill to amend title 23, United States Code, to establish a \nprogram to increase the use of recyclable material in the construction \nof Federal-aid highway; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation that I \nbelieve will provide the necessary incentives to improve State efforts \nin the use of recycled materials in highway construction and \nmaintenance. The use of recycled materials in highways is an \nestablished process in certain parts of the United States, with some \nStates using recycled materials on a regular basis. These materials \ninclude fly ash, bottom ash, rubber products from old tires, and \nreprocessed concrete and asphalt pavements. Less commonly used recycled \ncommodities include glass and plastic. The American Association of \nState Highway and Transportation Officials has recently approved \nspecifications for the use of biomass, including small diameter timber, \nproviding an additional avenue for use of recycled material. The list \nof accomplishments is impressive, but its application is limited. Many \nStates could do much more with the use of recycled materials in their \nhighway systems.\n  Challenges faced by States in the use of recycled material in \nhighways are attributed to several factors. Some State Departments of \nTransportation are unaware of the different types of recycled materials \nthat are available in today's construction industry. Others do not have \nthe technical expertise to take advantage of the broad range of \nrecycled materials and techniques. Some may not have developed the \nnecessary procurement infrastructure to include the use of recycled \nmaterials in highway construction.\n  To assist States in overcoming these obstacles and to provide \nnecessary incentives for the expansion of this economically and \nenvironmentally viable practice, I am introducing the Recycled Roads \nAct of 2003. The purpose of this bill is to authorize the Secretary of \nTransportation to establish a recycled roads incentive grant program to \nencourage the use of recyclable material in the construction of \nFederal-aid highways by States and Indian tribes. The program will \nprovide two types of grants. The first type, which is funded up to \n$125,000 per year, will be for a State or Indian tribe to use in \nemploying a coordinator to promote the use of recyclable material in \nFederal-aid highway construction. The second type, which is funded up \nto $1,400,000 per year, will be for a State or Indian tribe to use to \ncarry out projects and activities to promote the expanded use of \nrecycled material in Federal-aid highway construction and maintenance. \nTotal funding for both grants is $123,525,000 per year.\n  The case for expanded use of recycled materials in road construction \nis clear. Dr. T. Taylor Eighmy, Director of the University of New \nHampshire Recycled Materials Resource Center, from an article entitled \n``The Road to Reuse'' published in the professional journal Civil \nEngineering, states the case well: ``Why should we as a society \ncontinue to dispose of materials that may have inherent engineering \nvalue and suitable environmental properties and continue to rely on \nnonrenewable natural resources in constructing the U.S. infrastructure? \nIndeed, these materials may become increasingly deserving of \nconsideration as we tackle deteriorating infrastructure problems in the \nUnited States. And the use of recycled materials in lieu of natural \nmaterials may provide additional environmental benefits through better \nperformance and lower cost because there would be less need to mine, \nprocess, and transport traditional materials.\n  ``Applications for recycled materials within the highway environment \ninclude both bound and unbound uses: asphalt pavements, portland cement \nconcrete pavement, granular bases and subbases, stabilized bases, \nembankments, structural fills, flowable fills, soil cover and erosion \ncontrol, and appurtenances. Materials such as reclaimed asphalt \npavement, RAP, are widely recycled using both in-place and off-site \nrecycling methods. More than 45 States use RAP. The National Asphalt \nPaving Association reported in April 2000 that RAP has one of the \nhighest recycling rates in the United States--close to 80 percent. \nAbout 73 million tons are recycled each year, saving the taxpayers \nabout $300 million annually.''\n\n  The example of RAP is one of our best success stories in the use of \nrecycled materials in roads. However, there is much more that can be \ndone. As Dr. Eighmy explains, ``. . . the number of states that use \nrecycled materials varies significantly, as do the approaches states \ntake in conducting beneficial use determinations, particularly on less \ntraditional materials. There is a general sense that states with higher \nindustrial activities use more of the resulting by-products. . . . \nThere also appears to be a relation between a state's\n\n[[Page S7238]]\n\ncommitment to recycling and the maturity of the beneficial use program \nin that state.''\n  The Federal Highway Administration produced a policy on recycled \nmaterials in February of 2002, which strongly encourages the use of \nexisting recyclable materials in highway construction and maintenance. \nAs stated in the policy, ``Recycling presents environmental \nopportunities and challenges, which, when appropriately addressed, can \nmaximize the benefits of reuse. The use of most recycled materials \nposes no threat or danger to the air, soil, or water. Furthermore, \ncareful design, engineering and application of recycled materials can \nreduce or eliminate the need to search for and extract new, virgin \nmaterials from the land.\n  ``The engineering feasibility of using recycled materials has been \ndemonstrated in research, field studies, experimental projects and \nlong-term performance testing and analysis. Significant advances in \ntechnology over the past decade have increased the types of recycled \nmaterials in use and the range of their applications. When \nappropriately used, recycled materials can effectively and safely \nreduce cost, stave time, offer equal or in some cases, significant \nimprovement to performance qualities, and provide long-term \nenvironmental benefits.''\n  The Federal Highway Administration policy is supported by both \nscience and a common sense approach to the needs of building and \nmaintaining our national highway system. This bill provides the \nnecessary incentives to expand these beneficial recycling practices, \nand increase the associated environmental and engineering impacts.\n  In addition, this legislation was developed in consultation with \nseveral stakeholders from the Federal and state governments, and non-\ngovernmental organizations. The State of New Mexico, and the non-profit \norganizations Environmental Defense and the Surface Transportation \nPolicy Project have provided letters expressing their support for this \nlegislation.\n  I ask all Senators to support the Recycled Roads Act of 2003. I look \nforward to working with the Chairman of the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee, Senator Inhofe, and Senator Jeffords, the ranking \nmember, to incorporate his bill into the full 6-year reauthorization of \nthe transportation bill. I would also like to thank Jeff Steinborn from \nmy office in Las Cruces, New Mexico for his diligent work in developing \nthe initial concept for this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article from September 2001 \nprofessional society journal Civil Engineering entitled ``The Road to \nReuse'' by Dr. T. Taylor Eighmy, the February 2002 Federal Highway \nAdministration policy on recycled materials, and letters of support \nfrom the State of New Mexico, Environmental Defense, and the Surface \nTransportation Policy Project be printed in the Record. I also ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From Civil Engineering, Sept. 2001]\n\n                           The Road To Reuse\n\n                (By T. Taylor Eighmy and Bryan J. Magee)\n\n       Why should we as a society continue to dispose of materials \n     that may have inherent engineering value and suitable \n     environmental properties and continue to rely on nonrenewable \n     natural resources in constructing the U.S. infrastructure? \n     Shouldn't we be making a concerted effort to use recycled \n     materials as substitutes for natural aggregates or materials \n     in the construction of highway infrastructure? Indeed, these \n     materials may become increasingly deserving of consideration \n     as we tackle deteriorating infrastructure problems in the \n     United States. And the use of recycled materials in lieu of \n     naturals materials may provide additional environmental \n     benefits through better performance and lower cost because \n     there would be less need to mine, process, and transport \n     traditional materials.\n       There are many types of wastes and by-product materials \n     with potential uses in the highway environment. Ground \n     recycled asphalt pavement, crushed reclaimed concrete, \n     foundry sands, coal bottom ash, blast furnace slags, \n     nonferrous slags, steel slags, quarry by-products, shredded \n     tires, and glass cullet can all serve as aggregate \n     substitutes. Cement kiln dusts, silica fume, ground-\n     granulated blast furnace slag, class F coal fly ash, and \n     class C coal fly ash can serve as alternative cementitious \n     materials. Ground recycled asphalt pavement, roofing shingle \n     scraps, and ground rubber can serve as sources of asphalt \n     cement or asphalt modifiers. And coal combustion by-products, \n     wood ash, sludge ash, composted biomass, and ground wood \n     wastes can serve as soil amendments, soil cover, mulch, and \n     erosion control materials.\n       Applications for recycled materials within the highway \n     environment include both bound and unbound uses: asphalt \n     pavement, portland cement concrete pavement, granular bases \n     and subbases, stabilized bases, embankments, structural \n     fills, flowable fills, soil cover and erosion control, and \n     appurtenances. Materials such as reclaimed asphalt pavement \n     (RAP) are widely recycled using both in-place and off-site \n     recycling methods. More than 45 states use RAP. The National \n     Asphalt Paving Association reported in April 2000 that RAP \n     has one of the highest recycling rates in the United States--\n     close to 80 percent. About 73 million tons (66 million Mg) \n     are recycled each year, saving taxpayers almost $300 million \n     annually.\n       A recent, but incomplete, compilation of materials recycled \n     in the highway environment in the United States shows that \n     other materials are recycled annually at reasonable rates. \n     These annual usage and recycling rates are worth noting: \n     blast furnace slag--24 million tons (12.6 million Mg), 90 \n     percent recycling rate; coal fly ash--16 million tons (14.6 \n     million Mg), 27 percent; coal bottom ash--4.8 million tons \n     (4.4 milliono Mg), 30 percent; coal boiler slag--2.3 million \n     tons (2.1 million Mg), 91 percent; current kiln dust and lime \n     kiln dust--9.1 million tons (8.3 million Mg), 31 percent; and \n     steel slag--8.3 million tons (7.5 million Mg), percentage \n     unknown. However, the number of states that use recycled \n     materials varies significantly, as do the approaches states \n     take in conducting beneficial use determinations, \n     particularly on less traditional materials. There is a \n     general sense that states with higher industrial activity use \n     more of the resulting by-products--foundry sands and slags, \n     for example. There also appears to be a relation between a \n     state's commitment to recycling and the maturity of the \n     beneficial use program in that state.\n       A number of European countries have routinely used recycled \n     materials since the 1970s with a high degree of success. What \n     is remarkable about the European story is the recycling rate \n     of materials used (material used/material produced) in the \n     highway environment with rates of 100 percent frequently \n     noted. The Netherlands, a populous country with more \n     limited aggregate resources and a high degree of \n     industrialization and interest in land reclamation, is the \n     best example. The annual reported totals of metric tons \n     used, together with the recycling rates, are as follows: \n     steel slag--0.5 million, 100 percent; blast furnace slag--\n     1.2 million, 100 percent; coal bottom ash--0.08 million, \n     100 percent; coal fly ash--0.85 million, 100 percent; \n     construction and demolition aggregates--9.2 million, 100 \n     percent; municipal solid waste combustion bottom ash--0.8 \n     million, 100 percent; and RAP--10.7 million, 100 percent.\n       Data from a variety of sources suggest potential sources of \n     recycled materials for use in the highway environment. In \n     their paper ``Utilization of Waste Materials in Civil \n     Engineering,'' R.J. Collins and S.K. Ciesielski cited four \n     major sources of waste and by-product materials for highway \n     use: agriculture (2,100 million tons [1,905 million Mg] per \n     year), domestic (200 million tons [181 million Mg] per year) \n     industrial (400 million tons [363 million Mg] per year), and \n     mineral (1,800 million tons [1,633 million Mg] per year). \n     Combined, these account for about 4.5 billion tons per year.\n       Recent data from the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) \n     indicate that in 1997 there were almost 4 million mi (6.4 \n     million km) of roads in the United States--4 percent under \n     federal jurisdiction, 21 percent under state jurisdiction, \n     and 75 percent under local jurisdiction. Data from 1992 on \n     material uses in the highway environment from the National \n     Research Council show that the construction, rehabilitation, \n     and maintenance of U.S. highways require about 350 million \n     tons (318 million Mg) of natural and manufactured materials, \n     including 20 million tons (18 million Mg) per year of \n     asphalt, 10 million tons (9 million Mg) per year of portland \n     cement, and 320 million tons (290 million Mg) per year of \n     natural aggregates, paving mixtures, and synthetic surfacing \n     and coating materials. It is interesting to contrast these \n     numbers with the data presented on waste and by-product \n     production. Undoubtedly, these numbers have increased.\n       ASCE's 2001 Report Card for America's Infrastructure \n     indicates that one-third of the nation's roads are in poor or \n     mediocre condition, costing American drivers an estimated \n     $5.8 billion and contributing to as many as 13,800 highway \n     fatalities each year. Additionally, the assessment quotes \n     FHWA findings that 29 percent of the nation's bridges are \n     structurally deficient or functionally obsolete and its \n     estimate that elmininating all bridge deficiencies would cost \n     $10.6 billion over the course of 20 years. There is a \n     critical need for a significant investment of money and \n     material to help alleviate these conditions and for \n     changes in transportation behavior, transportation \n     investment, and the application of innovative \n     technologies. How much of this necessary rehabilitation \n     can make appropriate use--both economically and from long-\n     term engineering and environmental performance \n     perspectives--of the materials already present in \n     pavements, base courses, subbases, embankments, bridge \n     decks, and bridge abutments? What other waste or by-\n     product material might be used?\n\n[[Page S7239]]\n\n       The 1991 Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act \n     (ISTEA) gave high priority to research on recycling. Largely \n     as a result of this focus, the FHWA and the National \n     Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) sponsored \n     several projects related to recycling, all of them national \n     in scope. Other federal agencies have developed guidelines or \n     programs that in some way relate to the use of recycled \n     materials. For example, the publication User Guidelines for \n     Waste and By-Product Materials in Pavement Construction was \n     developed to assist those who have an interest in using or \n     increasing their understanding of the types of waste and by-\n     product materials that may be recovered and used in pavement \n     construction applications. By documenting the potential use \n     of 19 recycled materials in six construction applications, \n     these guidelines, which were produced by the FHWA and \n     published in 1997, are intended to describe the nature of \n     each material, suggest sources for obtaining additional \n     information, and outline the issues that need to be evaluated \n     when considering the use of a particular material. The \n     guidelines are also intended to provide general information \n     on engineering evaluation requirements, environmental issues, \n     and economic considerations in determining the suitability of \n     particular recovered materials in pavement applications. (An \n     electronic version of the guidelines is available at the Web \n     site of the Recycled Materials Resource Center \n     [www.rmrc.unh.edu/Partners/UserGuide/begin.htm].)\n       Funded by the NCHRP and completed in 1998, the Recycled \n     Materials Information Database was created as a tool that can \n     be used to review and store data on the properties and \n     applications of recycled material and on testing procedures. \n     Reference information is also included. With information on \n     21 materials, the database is divided into nine main \n     categories and provides the user with both general and \n     detailed engineering and environmental information on each \n     material. Recommended laboratory engineering tests that can \n     be used to assess the suitability of each waste and recycled \n     material for transportation applications are included, along \n     with recommendations for monitoring in-field trials. (Copies \n     of the database may be downloaded from the Recycled Materials \n     Resource Center Web site [www.rmrc.unh.edu/Resources/\nUsefulDocuments/NCHRP/NCHRP.asp].)\n       The Framework for Evaluating Use of Recycled Materials in \n     the Highway Environment was recently published by the FHWA to \n     establish a logical and hierarchical evaluation process that \n     all states can use either to develop a beneficial use \n     determination process or to refine an existing process of \n     this type. The purpose of this document is to help reduce \n     barriers to the use of recycled materials and to facilitate \n     the migration of successful practices across state \n     boundaries. Additionally, because the management and \n     regulation of recycled materials use in the highway \n     environment are jurisdictionally the responsibility of a \n     state's department of transportation (DOT) and its \n     environmental protection agency (EPA), a major goal was to \n     work with state DOTs and EPAs to develop a consensus-based \n     approach that would encourage the two agencies to work \n     together in the evaluation process. The process uses a series \n     of stages that can each lead to approval or a beneficial use \n     application from both an engineering and an environmental \n     perspective. It comprises issue definition, data evaluation, \n     laboratory testing, and field tests. The project used an \n     expert technical group to help develop the framework. DOTs \n     and EPAs from Florida, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, \n     and New York were involved. (An electronic version of the \n     guidelines is available on the Web site of the Recycled \n     Materials Resource Center [www.rmrc.unh.edu/Partners/\nFramework/Start/start.html].)\n       The report Environmental Impact of Construction and Repair \n     Materials on Surface and Ground Waters (NCHRP 25-9) was \n     prepared by the NCHRP after determining whether commonly used \n     construction and repair materials might affect--through the \n     persistence of any toxic leachates--the quality of surface \n     water or groundwater adjacent to highways. A number of widely \n     used waste and by-product materials were included in this \n     evaluation. By developing a model that can be applied to \n     any medium through which the leachates might pass, the \n     report provides users with a tool capable of predicting \n     the potential environmental harm of various waste and by-\n     product materials. (Copies of the report can be obtained \n     from the Transportation Research Board's bookstore [http:/\n     /national academies.org/trb/bookstore] by searching book \n     code NR448.)\n       Established in 1998 in close coordination with the FHWA's \n     Pavement Management Coordination Group, the Recycled \n     Materials Resource Center (RMRC) works on the national level \n     to promote the appropriate use of recycled materials in the \n     highways environment. The RMRC forms part of the \n     Environmental Research Group at the University of New \n     Hampshire. It has a unique role in the growing application of \n     recycled materials to highway construction--namely to serve \n     as a catalyst to reduce barriers to the appropriate use of \n     these materials. The center is a culmination of a number of \n     diverse but integrated efforts on the part of the FHWA, other \n     federal and state agencies, and academia to provide a \n     cohesive approach to the complex engineering and \n     environmental issues surrounding the use of recycled \n     materials. The RMRC focuses on both research and outreach \n     activities in carrying out its mission, and its principal \n     clients are state DOTs and EPAs.\n       In terms of research, the RMRC channels approximately half \n     of its overall budget to a diverse range of projects related \n     to recycling. At present 2 projects have been completed and \n     11 are in progress nationwide at a number of academic \n     institutions and consulting companies. In addition, with the \n     request for proposals issued by the center in February, three \n     are slated to commence in September. The projects address a \n     range of engineering and environmental issues related to \n     recycling, among them the mitigation of alkali silicate \n     reactions in recycled concrete; environmental weathering of \n     granular waste materials; concrete mixtures with inclusions \n     to improve the sound-absorbing capacity of portland cement \n     concrete pavements; and the development of a risk analysis \n     framework for the beneficial use of secondary materials. \n     Attention is also given to leaching from granular materials \n     used in highway construction during intermittent wetting: the \n     development and preparation of specifications for recycled \n     materials in transportation applications; the determination \n     of the number of revolutions needed for cold-in-place \n     Superpave mixture design using the sequential gyratory \n     compactor; the development of a rational and practical mix \n     design system for full depth reclamation; the fatigue \n     durability of stabilized recycled aggregate base course \n     containing coal fly ash and waste-plastic strip \n     reinforcement; and the development of lightweight synthetic \n     aggregate from coal fly ash and waste plastics.\n       The RMRC orchestrates numerous activities, the principal \n     and most accessible of which is its Web site \n     (www.rmrc.unh.edu). The site provides a variety of tools, \n     including a client registration feature; an information \n     request feature; virtual demonstration sites; updates on all \n     RMRC-funded research projects; numerous documents and \n     programs; links to pertinent specifications, state DOT \n     programs, literature search engines, and national and \n     international entities; lists of scheduled events; \n     information on funding opportunities; and access to libraries \n     and databases. In addition the center sends out a quarterly \n     electronic newsletter to its clients, keeping them abreast of \n     ongoing and upcoming events related to recycling.\n       Of particular interest is the center's first specification \n     to be adopted by the American Association of State Highway \n     and Transportation Officials (AASHTO). In December 2000 \n     AASHTO voted to adopt ``Glass Cullet Use for Soil Aggregate \n     Base Course'' as a new national specification (M-318-01). \n     While currently recognized as a national specification, the \n     document will first appear in the 21st edition of the AASHTO \n     specifications, which is slated for publication this year. \n     This recycling specification was developed by Warren Chesner \n     of Chesner Engineering, in Commack, New York, in conjunction \n     with the AASHTO subcommittee on materials as part of a \n     research project funded by the RMRC. The project is looking \n     at the properties of selected recycled materials and is \n     developing--with the assistance of a technical advisory group \n     made up of representatives of 15 state DOTS--specifications \n     in an AASHTO format for the use of these materials in highway \n     construction.\n       An upcoming outreach event of note is the international \n     conference Beneficial Use of Recycled Materials in \n     Transportation Applications, which the center is helping to \n     organize. All told, 163 abstracts have been submitted from \n     engineers and researchers from 23 different countries. The \n     event will be held in Washington, DC, November 13-15 (see \n     [www.rmrc.unh.edu/2001Conf/overview.asp]).\n       In September 1999 an FHWA delegation visited Sweden, \n     Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, and France to review and \n     document innovative policies, programs, and techniques that \n     would help to reduce barriers to the use of recycled \n     materials in U.S. highways. The delegation met with more than \n     100 representatives from transportation and environment \n     ministries, research organizations, contractors, and material \n     producers involved with recycled materials in those \n     countries. The U.S. delegation discerned a number of factors \n     that have played a role in the success of recycling on \n     highways in Europe, particularly in the Netherlands. The \n     factors fall under the general concept of sustainability \n     within the highway environment. The major components of the \n     sustainability initiatives are the three Es: economics, \n     engineering, and environment. (The final report is available \n     online at [www.international.fhwa.dot.gov/Pdfs/\nrecycolor.pdf].)\n       As a follow--on to the European visit, a workshop--\n     Partnerships for Sustainability: A New Approach to Highway \n     Materials--was developed to share European advances in \n     recycling in the highway environment with a targeted audience \n     of state DOT materials engineers, state DOT environmental \n     staff members, and state EPA staff members who work on \n     beneficial use. Fifteen states were invited to send \n     representatives to the workshop, and more than 100 people \n     attended. The goals were to showcase recent developments, \n     introduce the Dutch sustainability concept, and encourage \n     state agency personnel to work together on all aspects of \n     using recycled materials on highways. (The workshop is \n     highlighted on the RMRC Web page [www.rmrc.unh.edu/\npartner.asp], and the final report can be accessed at \n     [www.rmrc.unh.edu/Partners/finalreport.asp].)\n\n[[Page S7240]]\n\n       The FHWA has established a team to provide leadership, \n     direction, and technical guidance to the transportation \n     community to promote the use of recycled materials in highway \n     environments and to provide technical support and assistance. \n     The team is preparing a white paper that will set forth \n     priority initiatives for recycling, and it is forming \n     partnerships with AASHTO's subcommittees on materials and \n     construction, with the RMRC, and with industry. Members of \n     the team--their FHWA division given in parentheses--include \n     Jason Harrington and Michael Rafalowski (Infrastructure Core \n     Business Unit), Connie Hill (Planning and Environment Core \n     Business Unit), Terry Mitchell and Jack Youtcheff (Research \n     and Development Support Business Unit), Michael Smith \n     (Southern Resource Center), Walter Waidlich (New Hampshire \n     Division), Bryan Cawley (North Dakota Division), and Jim \n     Travis (Texas Division).\n       A number of state DOTs have established recycling \n     coordinator positions. These positions frequently figure \n     prominently in technology transfer, research coordination, \n     and informational outreach. The DOTs of California, \n     Massachusetts, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Texas all \n     have active programs.\n\n\n                              MassHighway\n\n       Over the past few years, the Massachusetts DOT, \n     MassHighway, has made significant progress on the recycling \n     front. Steps have been taken throughout the department to \n     increase the use of waste and recycled materials in \n     construction projects and everyday activities; to focus on \n     recycled, remanufactured, and environmentally beneficial \n     materials in procurement decisions for offices, stockrooms, \n     facilities, and construction sites; and to promote the \n     recycling of various waste streams. Recycling and \n     environmentally beneficial procurement are becoming part of \n     the routine way of doing business at MassHighway. Although \n     highway performance, safety, and cost are of primary \n     importance, as long as recycled and environmentally \n     beneficial materials and products can fill this bill, they \n     will be considered comparable, if not superior, to virgin \n     alternatives.\n       Recent projects in Massachusetts include the procurement of \n     recycled antifreeze, re-refined oils, and safety vests \n     manufactured from soft drink bottles that are fully recycled; \n     the acceptance of specifications allowing for the use of \n     recycled plastic offset blocks as a substitute for pressure-\n     treated lumber blocks; and the commencement of a research \n     project to investigate the use of tire shreds beneath a \n     roadway embankment. In addition, there are plans to set up \n     trial and demonstration projects involving bio-based \n     lubricants, recycled street sweepings, and noise barriers \n     made of recycled plastic.\n       In 1999 alone, MassHighway was able to recycle more than \n     10,000 tons (9,000 Mg) of waste, use more than 138,000 tons \n     (125,000 Mg) of reclaimed or recycled materials in \n     construction projects, and spend more than $33 million on \n     materials and products that had a high recycled content or \n     were environmentally beneficial. There is still much to be \n     done. MassHighway will continue to evaluate its many \n     procurement procedures and specifications to remove \n     unnecessary barriers and find new applications for recycled \n     materials and materials that are environmentally beneficial. \n     It will also continue to examine its construction and \n     maintenance operations to find areas where waste can be \n     reduced. Additionally, it will continue to work in \n     coordination with local, state, and national environmental \n     and public works entities to share its experiences and to \n     learn more about the use of recycled and environmentally \n     beneficial materials in highway and roadway construction.\n\n\n                            pennslyvania dot\n\n       PennDOT has developed a strategic recycling program (SRP) \n     as a tool for systematically identifying, evaluating, and \n     implementing opportunities to sue recycled materials in \n     transportation and civil engineering work throughout the \n     state. The ultimate objective of the SRP is to realize \n     economic savings and environmental benefits for both PennDOT \n     and the state by recycling, limiting pollution, and \n     continuing various other environmental initiatives.\n       Five key areas have been targeted by the state to help \n     PennDOT achieve and sustain its mission to increase the use \n     of recycled materials:\n       (1) Research: Continue to evaluate the existing uses of \n     recycled materials and products and conduct research into new \n     uses of recycled materials in transportation and civil \n     engineering work.\n       (2) Specifications: Develop and approve material and use \n     specifications, bidding specifications, and guidelines for \n     the use of recycled materials that confer significant \n     environmental, engineering, or economic benefits.\n       (3) Project development: Identify, promote, and plan \n     projects that use recycled materials that conform to approved \n     or provisional specifications.\n       (4) Communication: Provide information via various media to \n     PennDOT, government agencies, and the public on the \n     performance and applicability of recycled materials in \n     transportation and civil engineering work.\n       (5) Contract bidding: Evaluate construction contract legal \n     bidding requirements and develop innovative ways to enable \n     PennDOT to specify the use of recycled materials in \n     transportation construction and maintenance projects.\n\n\n                           North Carolina DOT\n\n       Last year NCDOT recycled 2.4 million lb (1.1 million kg) of \n     metal, 1 million lb (450,000 kg) of paper products, and more \n     than 30,000 lb (14,000 kg) of glass and plastic as part of \n     their daily operations. In addition to these efforts, the \n     department continues to seek applications for recycled \n     products in highway construction. Since 1989 the NCDOT has \n     used more than 7 million tires, 50,000 tons (45,000 kg) of \n     glass beads, and 14,000 tons (13,000 kg) of asphalt shingles.\n       Lyndo Tippett, the state's secretary of transportation, has \n     indicated he will expand the department's environmental \n     efforts. ``As a native of rural North Carolina, I know \n     firsthand the value of our state's natural resources,'' he \n     said. ``We must be proactive about finding opportunities that \n     not only protect our environment but also improve it.''\n       One such opportunity is the department's partnership with \n     Habitat for Humanity of Wake County, which won an \n     environmental excellence award from the FHWA this year. In \n     this program, Habitat helps raze houses within the \n     department's rights-of-way that are scheduled for demolition.\n       Prospective homeowners help demolish the houses, earning \n     credit toward the construction of their new homes. Materials \n     are then stored in Habitat's reuse center and sold to the \n     general public at reduced prices. The department is currently \n     working to develop partnerships with other Habitat chapters \n     throughout the state.\n       Another initiative is a pilot project with Bion \n     Technologies, of Clayton, North Carolina. Last year the \n     company donated 900 lb (410 kg) of swine waste for use as an \n     alternative to commercial fertilizer. NCDOT roadside \n     environmental engineers are currently working with the \n     company to monitor the effectiveness of this product in \n     test plots of wildflower beds along U.S. 117 south of \n     Goldsboro to see if more widespread use is warranted.\n       ``Our partnerships with Habitat for Humanity and Bion \n     Technologies demonstrate to the public the positive effect \n     that recycling has on our culture as well as our \n     environment,'' said Tippett. ``These efforts also prove that \n     it is possible to have a quality transportation system and a \n     beautiful environment at the same time.''\n\n\n                               texas dot\n\n       TxDOT's road to recycling initiative represents a mammoth \n     endeavor to use recycled materials in road construction and \n     maintenance projects. The goal of this initiative is to \n     increase the use of recycled materials in road construction \n     when they confer environmental benefits and economic or \n     engineering advantages.\n       Since 1995 TxDOT has coordinated more than $1 million worth \n     of research to investigate the use of a broad array of \n     recycled materials in road construction, including glass \n     cullet, scrap tires, fly and bottom ash, crushed porcelain \n     toilets, shredded brush, compost, roofing shingles, plastics, \n     RAP, crushed concrete, and industrial wastes. The research \n     has been equally broad in the scope of roadway construction \n     applications studied and has examined road signs, roadway \n     safety devices, embankments, asphalt and concrete pavements, \n     soil erosion control, drainage, vertical moisture barriers, \n     and road bases.\n       Information on the merits of recycled roadway materials has \n     been disseminated around the world through information \n     showcases, press releases, a video, a Web site, two \n     conferences, and a yearlong publicity campaign.\n       Since the inception of its recycling program in 1994, TxDOT \n     has spent more than $506 million on ``green'' products and \n     diverted more than 13 million tons (12 million Mg) of \n     materials from landfills--a diversion equivalent to more than \n     1,300 lb (590 kg) for every man, woman, and child in Texas. \n     These staggering numbers are for the most part directly \n     attributable to the use of recycled materials in road \n     construction applications.\n       As part of its continuing efforts to promote the use of \n     materials recovered from solid waste, the U.S. EPA has \n     developed the Comprehensive Procurement Guideline (CPG) \n     program. The institutional purchase of recycled products by \n     government ensures that the materials collected in recycling \n     programs will be used again in the manufacture of new \n     products. Congress authorizes the CPG program under section \n     6002 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). \n     The CPG process designates products that are or can be made \n     with recycled materials. At present for construction \n     products, coal fly ash and ground granulated blast furnace \n     slag are listed for cement and concrete materials, and coal \n     fly ash and foundry sands are listed for flowable fill. \n     Materials are also listed for transportation and landscaping \n     categories. (Additional information is available at \n     [www.epa.gov/cpg/].)\n\n\n                           other initiatives\n\n       Established in the 1990s by the U.S. Department of Energy \n     (DOE), the Industries for the Future Program creates \n     partnerships linking industry, government, and supporting \n     laboratories and institutions to accelerate technology \n     research, development, and deployment. The DOE's Office of \n     Industrial Technologies is implementing the program for nine \n     energy- and waste-intensive industries, namely agriculture, \n     aluminum, chemicals, forest products, glass, metal casting, \n     mining, petroleum, and steel. The program's goal of \n     increasing competitiveness and reducing energy consumption \n     waste involves recycling\n\n[[Page S7241]]\n\n     by-products from these industries. A recent conference hosted \n     by the DOE and the Civil Engineering Research Foundation \n     explored recycling opportunities for these industries and in \n     formulating plans for the future looked at perceived \n     barriers, market needs, and collaborative relationships. (For \n     additional information about the Industries for the Future \n     Program, see [www.oit.doe.gov/industries.shtml].)\n       Life-cycle analysis (LCA) has become increasingly common in \n     civil engineering construction applications. Indeed, its use \n     is being widely encouraged in addressing America's \n     infrastructure problems. An excellent example of this \n     application is the model BridgeLCC, developed by the National \n     Institute for Standards and Technology for use evaluating \n     high-performance bridges. BridgeLCC (see [www.bfrl.nist.gov/\n bridgelccl] is geared toward helping design engineers \n     estimate and compare the life-cycle costs of a new \n     technology--for example, high-performance concrete or fiber-\n     reinforced-polymer (FRP) composites--with those of a \n     conventional technology made with conventional materials. The \n     FHWA has instituted similar models for highway design (see \n     [www.fhwa.dot.gov/resourcecenters/southern/msmith.htm]).\n       There is less experience here in the United States with the \n     application of LCA in deciding whether to use recycled \n     materials or traditional materials in highway work, and this \n     is even more pronounced when environmental burdens or \n     emissions are included in the model. Recent work by the \n     Finnish National Road Administration has resulted in the \n     development of a comprehensive LCA and inventory analysis \n     program. In Finland the production and transport of materials \n     produce the most significant environmental burdens; the \n     activities that consume the most energy are the production of \n     bituminous asphalt and cement and the crushing and transport \n     of materials. The consumption of raw materials and the \n     leaching behavior of recycled materials there were also \n     regarded as being of great significance. A weighted \n     environmental loading assessment for three scenarios (coal \n     fly ash in subbase and stabilized subbase; crushed concrete \n     in base and subbase; and blast furnace slags in base, \n     subbase, and lower subbase) and a traditional construction \n     scenario were conducted in the Finnish study. The use of \n     blast furnace slag, crushed concrete, and coal fly ash in \n     road bases was seen as imposing a lower total environmental \n     loading than the use of coal fly ash in stabilized subbases \n     or the use of traditional pavements using crushed rock.\n       Obviously, such analytical tools and case studies need to \n     be developed and applied to scenarios here in the United \n     States. However, the Finnish National Road Administration \n     data suggest that in a broader sense there may be additional \n     benefits to using recycled materials when life-cycle material \n     costs are considered in conjunction with the harm to the \n     environmental caused by energy production and the processing \n     and transport of materials.\n       In refining their strategic plans, state DOT may find it \n     advantageous to consider the role of recycling. In addition, \n     as studies are carried out on proposed transportation \n     projects under the auspices of the National Environmental \n     Policy Act, is it possible that credit might be given for the \n     use of recycled materials, particularly if LCA shows that the \n     materials convey environmental benefits?\n       The Netherlands probably best typifies the concept of \n     sustainability, and it offers a suitable model for certain \n     states and metropolitan areas here in the United States. The \n     recycling or reuse of secondary materials within the Dutch \n     building industry is commonplace--more than 10 percent of all \n     granular materials used in the building industry are \n     recycled.\n       The Netherlands is an affluent country with high population \n     densities and limited land resources. The public has elected \n     not to set aside areas for landfills or aggregate mining. \n     This has led to the practice of sustainable development \n     within the building industry, as well as to a subset of that \n     industry: the highway construction industry. The basic \n     premise of the sustainability concept is that material cycles \n     should be closed (recycling involving use, reuse, re-reuse, \n     et cetera) so that there is less outright disposal and less \n     consumption of non-renewable natural materials. A number of \n     legislative initiatives, including the National Environmental \n     Policy Plan, the Waste Materials Policy, the Soil Protection \n     Policy, the Surface Minerals Policy, and the Construction \n     Industry Policy Declaration, provide the underpinning for \n     sustainable construction.\n       The Dutch have adopted a market philosophy that regards \n     recycled materials as products rather than waste. This means \n     that the product will exhibit a typical product life cycle in \n     the marketplace. Recycled materials first undergo development \n     before coming into widespread use and maturing. Government \n     and private-sector publicity campaigns and policies support \n     the market. This concept might prove applicable in the United \n     States in states or geographic regions where population \n     densities are high, natural aggregates are scarce, and \n     sources of suitable recycled materials are plentiful.\n       The Dutch government provides clear and unequivocal \n     engineering and environmental standards for all recycled \n     materials. This is usually achieved through governmental \n     research in support of the standards. Further, public or \n     industry working groups (including contractors) work \n     together to achieve these standards. The producers of \n     recycled materials use certified quality assurance and \n     quality control programs so that their goods can compete \n     against natural materials. The policy is clear, as is the \n     planning and implementation, which enables the producers \n     and contractors to prepare for this new market. The \n     government provides certain economic incentives, such as \n     hefty landfill disposal taxes on materials that can be \n     recycled and modest taxes on the use of natural \n     aggregates. If these aspects are combined, then a mature \n     recycling market can develop over time.\n       There is a clear need for partnerships linking the private \n     sector, universities, research institutions, government \n     bodies, environmental groups, and the public. This relates to \n     the formulation and coordination of policy, the transfer of \n     information, and making resources available for additional \n     research and development (R).\n       The private sector can play a variety of roles. Those \n     interested in having their by-products considered can make \n     use of the document Framework for Evaluating Use of Recycled \n     Materials in the Highway Environment so that they can work \n     with state DOTs and EPAs to develop the necessary data for \n     evaluation. Contractors can explore the use of recycled \n     materials to help meet the requirements of performance bonds. \n     Equipment manufacturers can also play a role by developing \n     technologies that would make it possible to recycle materials \n     on-site for pavements, bridges, and other civil \n     infrastructure, thereby reducing transport costs and \n     associated environmental burdens.\n       At the state level, it may be appropriate for the DOTs to \n     consider recycling as stand-alone policy or as part and \n     parcel of their strategic plans. PennDOT's SRP may be a \n     starting point in efforts to systematically find, evaluate, \n     and apply recycled materials in transportation and civil \n     engineering work (see [www.dot.state.pa.us/penndot/bureaus/\nbeq.nsf/srp?OpenPage]). State DOTs may wish to give credit to \n     recycling strategies during the planning stage of \n     transportation projects, as well as in analyzing alternatives \n     and mitigation measures. In planning transportation \n     projects states could develop checklists that ask \n     questions about recycling choices or options for use, with \n     the responses used in analyzing alternatives and \n     evaluating secondary and cumulative effects. States could \n     use information derived from LCAs as part of their \n     benefits analysis and in information packages prepared for \n     public hearings and for obtaining permits.\n       A more formal relationship between AASHTO and the \n     Association of State and Territorial Solid Waste Management \n     Officials is definitely worth exploring as this can help pave \n     the way for relationships at the state level. State DOTs and \n     EPAs might consider adopting beneficial use evaluation \n     frameworks similar to successful ones already in place or to \n     the generic one offered by the Framework for Evaluating Use \n     of Recycled Materials in the Highway Environment.\n       A lowering of the barriers encountered in transferring \n     technologies from one jurisdiction to another across state \n     lines would be a great benefit. Fortunately, the \n     Environmental Council of State (see [www.sso.org/ecos/]) has \n     two programs related to reciprocity. The group called \n     Interstate Technology Regulatory Cooperation (ITRC) is a \n     state-led national coalition dedicated to achieving better \n     environmental protection through the use of innovative \n     technologies. The ITRC (www.itrcweb.org/) is exploring \n     general reciprocity arrangements involving 37 state members. \n     Six states (California, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, \n     Pennsylvania, and Virginia), under the Environmental \n     Technology Acceptance and Reciprocity Partnership (e.TARP) \n     are exploring reciprocity arrangements of a more formal type, \n     including one for beneficial use determinations.\n       One recommendation that was strongly emphasized in the \n     final report on the workshop Partnerships for Sustainability: \n     A New Approach to Highway Materials Partnerships for \n     Sustainability is that state DOTs establish recycling \n     coordinator positions for the purposes of technology \n     transfer, research coordination, and outreach.\n       At the federal level, partnerships linking the private \n     sector, the FHWA, the U.S. EPA, the DOE, and other competent \n     agencies are encouraged. Two obvious examples might be \n     coordinating the U.S. EPA's CPG program with the DOE's \n     Industries for the Future Program. Funneling beneficial use \n     applications and adopted specifications to the CPG program \n     also makes sense. There may be an opportunity to establish a \n     leadership council that could coordinate communication and \n     policy and improve intergovernmental approaches. Shared \n     funding should be considered for lowering barriers between \n     jurisdictions, demonstrating the use of innovative materials, \n     and applying ICA analysis. A recent report on the role to be \n     played by the National Science Foundation in meeting \n     environmental science and engineering needs in the 21st \n     century named industrial ecology (including product and \n     process ICA) as a program needing enhancement. This topic \n     should include recycling for infrastructure improvement.\n       Congress is considering a number of bills that could serve \n     as vehicles in promoting recycling. The reauthorization of \n     the next highway bill in 2003 provides an excellent \n     opportunity to further promote appropriate recycling, \n     partnerships, technology transfer,\n\n[[Page S7242]]\n\n     and R Making funds available to allow two or more states \n     to carry out joint demonstration projects would go a long way \n     toward reducing barriers. Congress can also examine the \n     information recently provided by the U.S. EPA's Science \n     Advisory Board on overcoming barriers to waste utilization \n     (see [www.epa.gov/science1/eeccm06.pdf]). One of the board's \n     most important recommendations--interpreting key definitions \n     so that wastes could be beneficially used and not be \n     inappropriately labeled as hazardous--would help with the \n     confusion at the federal level about the need for a third \n     category of by-product. Material that qualifies for inclusion \n     in this category would not be labeled as solid waste or as \n     hazardous waste; rather it would be suitable for beneficial \n     reuse in an open market. The reauthorization of the RCRA may \n     provide a suitable opportunity for this change.\n                                  ____\n\n\n        Federal Highway Administration Recycled Materials Policy\n\n\n                        ADMINISTRATOR'S MESSAGE\n\n       The National Highway System (NHS) is extensive, with over \n     160,000 miles of highway pavements and over 128,000 \n     structures, built using large quantities of asphalt, \n     concrete, steel, and aggregate, and smaller quantities of \n     nonferrous metals, plastics, and other materials. Much of the \n     system was constructed in the 1960's and 70's and is in need \n     of major rehabilitation or total reconstruction; and much of \n     the materials used to build that system can be recycled for \n     use in the new construction. In order to carry out the \n     mission of the FHWA, i.e., to ``improve the quality of the \n     Nation's highway system,'' the NHS must be properly \n     preserved, maintained, rehabilitated, and when necessary, \n     reconstructed. Maintenance of highways and associated \n     structures is critical to our ability to provide the safest, \n     most efficient roadway system possible, while simultaneously \n     providing the greatest level of protection to the human and \n     natural environment.\n       The same materials used to build the original highway \n     system can be re-used to repair, reconstruct, and maintain \n     them. Where appropriate, recycling of aggregates and other \n     highway construction materials makes sound economic, \n     environmental, and engineering sense. The economic benefits \n     from the re-use of nonrenewable highway materials can provide \n     a great boost to the highway industry. Recycling highway \n     construction materials can be a cost-saving measure, freeing \n     funds for additional highway construction, rehabilitation, \n     preservation or maintenance.\n       Recycling presents environmental opportunities and \n     challenges, which, when appropriately addressed, can maximize \n     the benefits of re-use. The use of most recycled materials \n     poses no threat or danger to the air, soil, or water. \n     Furthermore, careful design, engineering and application of \n     recycled materials can reduce or eliminate the need to search \n     for and extract new, virgin materials from the land. The \n     engineering feasibility of using recycled materials has been \n     demonstrated in research, field studies, experimental \n     projects and long-term performance testing and analysis. \n     Significant advances in technology over the past decade have \n     increased the types of recycled materials in use and the \n     range of their applications. When appropriately used, \n     recycled materials can effectively and safely reduce cost, \n     save time, offer equal or, in some cases, significant \n     improvement to performance qualities, and provide long-term \n     environmental benefits.\n       FHWA has established agency goals for enhancing the human \n     and natural environment, increasing mobility, raising \n     productivity, improving safety throughout the highway \n     industry, and preserving national security. All of these \n     goals are stated in our strategic plan, and we will ensure \n     that the FHWA recycling policy and recycling programs are in \n     alignment with those goals and underlying principles. This \n     recycling policy statement is offered to advance the use of \n     recycled materials in highway applications. It is intended to \n     provide leadership, direction, and technical guidance to the \n     transportation community for the use of recycling technology \n     and materials in the highway environment. The FHWA policy is:\n       1. Recycling and reuse can offer engineering, economic and \n     environmental benefits.\n       2. Recycled materials should get first consideration in \n     materials selection.\n       3. Determination of the use of recycled materials should \n     include an initial review of engineering and environmental \n     suitability.\n       4. An assessment of economic benefits should follow in the \n     selection process.\n       5. Restrictions that prohibit the use of recycled materials \n     without technical basis should be removed from \n     specifications.\n       FHWA has a longstanding position that any material used in \n     highway or bridge construction, be it virgin or recycled, \n     shall not adversely affect the performance, safety or the \n     environment of the highway system. This remains a cornerstone \n     in our policy statement. In order to foster innovation and \n     future development we support research, field trials, and \n     project demonstrations showcasing the findings.\n       We will do this with: People:\n       The FHWA Recycling Team.\n       Creation of a team of champions in our Division Offices \n     that will be points of contact for recycling technology.\n       Partnering:\n       The Recycled Materials Resource Center.\n       Working with the AASHTO Subcommittee on Materials and \n     Environment.\n       AASHTO Standing Committee on Highways recently passed a \n     resolution on ``Use of Recycled Materials''.

Two current issues we are \n     pursuing are: (1) The feasibility of rubberized pavement in \n     roadway construction, and (2) The use of compost and/or mulch \n     as an alternative to reseeding upon the completion of \n     construction related projects.\n       Another important aspect of this legislation is that \n     through its reporting requirements, it will enhance \n     communication and cooperation between the NMSHTD (NMDOT) and \n     other groups who are interested in the use of recycled \n     materials in transportation facility maintenance and \n     construction (e.g., state and tribal Departments of \n     Transportation).\n       This legislation can provide the Department an opportunity \n     to expand and accelerate progress in areas we currently \n     pursue with limited resources.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Rhonda G. Faught,\n     Cabinet Secretary.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                        Environmental Defense,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 22, 2003.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: Environmental Defense is pleased to \n     endorse the Recycled Roads Act, which promotes the use of \n     nontoxic recycled materials as road construction materials. \n     Using these recycled materials not only diverts them from \n     landfills and incinerators, but also reduces energy use and \n     pollution associated with manufacturing virgin materials for \n     road construction, thus benefiting the environment and human \n     health. It also provides economic benefits by enhancing \n     markets for recycling of materials like glass and tires that \n     have traditionally had limited recycling markets or \n     viability. Because some potentially recyclable materials have \n     toxic constituents, the bill's provisions requiring \n     evaluation of risk (in conjunction with the Administrator of \n     the Environmental Protection Agency) are a key aspect of the \n     bill. As always, our endorsement is specific to the text of \n     the bill as it stands at this point.\n       Thank you for taking a leadership role on this important \n     issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Karen Florini,\n     Senior Attorney.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            Surface Transportation\n\n\n                                               Policy Project,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 22, 2003.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: On behalf of the Surface \n     Transportation Policy Project, I am writing to convey our \n     support for your legislation, the ``Recycle Roads Act of \n     2003.''\n       The Surface Transportation Policy Project, among it goals, \n     seeks improved energy use and environmental protection. We \n     believe that our transportation investments, services and \n     incentives should not only meet our travel needs, but also \n     can further our efforts to protect and enhance the integrity \n     of our natural resources and enhance resource efficiency and \n     energy conservation goals.\n       We know that the use of recyclable materials in \n     transportation projects conserves raw materials and reduces \n     the quantities of waste deposited in landfills. We also see \n     recyclable materials as part of a broader effort to extend \n     the life cycle of our transportation facilities, an important \n     value as we continue to look for ways to leverage available \n     dollars.\n\n[[Page S7243]]\n\n       Increased recycling can deliver engineering, economic and \n     environmental benefits, including increased opportunities for \n     rural economic development. The legislation would help create \n     new markets and incentives for recycling in small communities \n     and would provide additional savings for all levels of \n     government. The legislation would also foster greater \n     cooperation between transportation and environmental programs \n     carried out by states or Indian tribes.\n       We applaud your leadership in developing this legislation \n     and support your efforts to move it forward during this \n     Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Anne Canby,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                                S. 1168\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Recycled Roads Act of \n     2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) in 2000, there were more than 3,951,000 miles of \n     highways in the United States;\n       (2) in the early 1990s, as much as 350,000,000 tons of raw \n     and recyclable material were used annually for highway \n     construction, rehabilitation, and maintenance;\n       (3) in 2002, the Federal Government provided \n     $26,348,000,000, or more than 34 percent of funding, for \n     highways in the United States;\n       (4) at least 45 States recycle a total of 73,000,000 tons \n     of reclaimed asphalt pavement annually, the use of which \n     results in an annual savings of approximately $300,000,000 as \n     compared with the cost of using raw material;\n       (5) in 2002, the Federal Highway Administration issued a \n     policy encouraging States to use recycled material in highway \n     construction because recycling and reuse can offer \n     engineering, economic, and environmental benefits;\n       (6) greater incorporation of recyclable material in highway \n     construction would--\n       (A) provide a significant new national market for the use \n     of recyclable material;\n       (B) create new markets and incentives for recycling in \n     small communities;\n       (C) conserve raw material; and\n       (D) reduce the quantities of waste deposited in landfills \n     in the United States (which would produce an additional \n     savings for the Federal Government and State governments); \n     and\n       (7) the increased use of recyclable material in highway \n     construction could--\n       (A) provide additional opportunities for rural economic \n     development; and\n       (B) encourage expanded use of biomass products.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to decrease the United States dependence on imported \noil by the year 2015; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to introduce \nlegislation that would reduce our Nation's dependence on imported oil. \nLast year, Senator Carper and I introduced this legislation as an \namendment to the energy bill and I offer it today to begin a debate and \ndialogue in the Senate about the merits of this goal.\n  During last year's energy bill consideration, I joined over 60 of my \ncolleagues in voting for the Levin-Bond\n\n[[Page S7244]]\n\namendment regarding the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards for \ncars, SUV's, and light trucks. Given the instability in the Middle East \nand our Nation's reliance on foreign oil, Senator Carper and I offered \nadditional language to slow the growth of our dependency on oil in a \nmeasurable way on the energy bill.\n  I supported the Levin-Bond amendment because, among other things, it \nwould have invested Federal dollars in research and development of \nadvanced technology vehicles. It would have harnessed the power of \ngovernment to purchase and commercialize hybrid and fuel cell-powered \nvehicles. I also supported the amendment's accompanying tax incentives, \nwhich would further encourage the production and purchase of advanced, \nfuel-efficient vehicles.\n  However, the Levin-Bond amendment fell short in one important area - \nit did not include a clear, measurable objective for oil savings. The \nissue is not just the Corporate Average Fuel Efficiency, CAFE, or Miles \nPer Gallon, MPG,--rather it is oil and our growing dependence on \nimports for 56 percent of what we use. The bill I am introducing today \nwould implement the Levin-Bond requirement that the Secretary of \nTransportation issue new regulations setting forth increased average \nfuel economy standards and further require that the Secretary of \nTransportation issue regulations to reduce the amount of oil consumed \nin our passenger cars and light trucks in 2015 by 1,000,000 barrels per \nday compared to consumption without such regulations in place.\n  Federal research has identified promising fuel technologies, \nincluding fuels developed from biomass, coal waste, and other sources \nthat could play a role in reducing our dependence on traditional, \nforeign crude oil and facilitate a transition to advanced fuels. For \nexample, one important effort that is happening in Pennsylvania \ninvolves a recent $100 million U.S. Department of Energy grant to build \nthe first U.S. coal-waste-to-clean-fuel plant. This $612 million plant \nis expected to produce 5,000 barrels of sulfur-free diesel or other \ntypes of transportation fuel daily. This will have the multiple \nbenefits of removing coal waste, reducing acid mine drainage, producing \nfuels that will reduce air pollution, and using a domestic energy \nsupply, thus reducing the need to import foreign oil. The bill I am \nintroducing today tasks the Department of Energy to work with the \nDepartment of Transportation to develop and encourage such \ntechnologies.\n  America uses about 8 million barrels of oil daily to power the \nvehicles that we drive. The Department of Energy forecasts that this \namount will climb to 10.6 million barrels per day by 2015, an increase \nof over 35 percent. I propose to limit that growth to 23 percent, or \n9.6 million barrels.\n  America's national security is jeopardized by our growing dependence \non foreign oil. Oil imports now account for a third of our nation's \ntrade deficit, which exceeded $400 billion in 2001. I will continue to \nraise the issue of the untenable position the United States is in by \nrelying on oil from the Middle East. This is highlighted by the fact \nthat we continue to see suicide bombings in Israel and new attacks in \nother Middle Eastern nations such as Saudi Arabia and Morocco.\n  Additionally, the exhausts of our motor vehicles are the source of \nsignificant amounts of air pollution, including a quarter of the carbon \ndioxide emitted into our atmosphere, which is sited as a lead \ncontributor to global climate change.\n  To address these concerns, Congress need not attempt to micro manage \na solution by setting higher CAFE levels. We should, however, set a \nclear, measurable objective--reducing the growth in oil consumption by \nat least a million barrels per day by 2015. We should then delegate to \nNHTSA, as the energy bill would have accomplished last year under the \nLevin-Bond amendment and my legislation does, the responsibility for \nworking with the auto industry to achieve that objective. That approach \nwill encourage American ingenuity and foster a public-private \npartnership that recognizes the interests of consumers and auto makers, \nas well as furthering public policy that will help relieve the very \nsignificant and dangerous policy of relying on our economy's lifeblood \nof oil from unstable regions.\n  As this body considers energy legislation, I encourage my colleagues \nto consider the importance of taking appropriate steps to reduce our \ndependence on foreign sources of energy, particularly oil. I invite my \ncolleagues to join me in this effort by cosponsoring this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN:\n  S. 1170. A bill to designate certain conduct by sports agents \nrelating to signing of contracts with student athletes as unfair and \ndeceptive acts or practices to be regulated by the Federal Trade \nCommission; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, summer is upon us. For many college \nathletes, that means leaving campus and heading back to a home in a \ndifferent state. Some may take the opportunity to do some traveling, or \neven to attend sports camps in various parts of the country.\n  Unfortunately, this well-earned break can carry real risks for the \nathletes and their schools. Why? Because traveling student athletes may \nbe big targets for opportunistic sports agents--and due to highly \ninconsistent state laws on the subject, the legal protections that an \nathlete might enjoy in the state where the college is located don't \nnecessarily apply elsewhere.\n  Today I am reintroducing a bill to address this issue, the Sports \nAgent Responsibility and Trust Act. The purpose of the bill is simple: \nto set some basic, uniform nationwide rules to prevent unscrupulous \nbehavior by sports agents who court student athletes. The universities \nin Oregon with top athletic programs--the University of Oregon, Oregon \nState University, and Portland State University--have all provided \nletters of endorsement for this legislation. So has the NCAA.\n  Too often, unscrupulous sports agents prey upon young student \nathletes who are inexperienced, naive, or simply don't know all of the \ncollegiate athletic eligibility rules. The agent sees the student \nathlete as a potentially lucrative future client, and wants to get the \nbiggest headstart possible on other agents. So the agent tries to \ncontact and sign up the student athlete as early as possible, and does \nwhatever takes to get the inside track.\n  In some cases, the agent may attempt to lure the student athlete with \ngrand promises. In some cases, the agent may offer flashy gifts. To \nmake the offer more enticing, the agent may withhold crucial \ninformation about the impact on the student's eligibility to compete in \ncollege sports.\n  A majority of States have enacted statutes to address unprincipled \nbehavior by sports agents, but the standards vary from State to State \nand some states don't have any at all. The universities in my State of \nOregon tell me that this creates a significant loophole. Specifically, \nOregon has a State law, but it doesn't apply when, for example, a \nUniversity of Oregon athlete goes home to another State for the summer \nand is contacted by an agent there. Every time that athlete crosses \ninto another State a different set of rules apply. And if one State's \nlaws on the subject are particularly weak, that is where shady sports \nagents will try to contact their targets.\n  That is why there ought to be a single, nationwide standard. The bill \nI am introducing today would establish a uniform baseline, enforceable \nby the Federal Trade Commission, that would supplement but not replace \nexisting state laws. Specifically, the bill would make it an unfair and \ndeceptive trade practice for a sports agent to entice a student athlete \nwith false or misleading information or promises or with gifts to the \nstudent athlete or the athlete's friends or family. It would require a \nsports agent to provide the student athlete with a clear, standardized \nwarning, in writing, that signing an agency contract could jeopardize \nthe athlete's eligibility to participate in college sports. It would \nmake it unlawful to pre-date or post-date agency contracts, and require \nboth the agent and student athlete to promptly inform the athlete's \nuniversity if they do enter into a contract.\n  Representative Bart Gordon of Tennessee has spearheaded this \nlegislation in the House, where the Energy and Commerce Committee and \nthe Judiciary Committee have both considered and approved the bill this \nyear. I'm told that consideration on the House\n\n[[Page S7245]]\n\nfloor could occur this week. I applaud Congressman Gordon for his \nleadership on this issue, and I urge my Senate colleagues to join me in \naddressing this matter in the Senate.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1170\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that States should enact the \n     Uniform Athlete Agents Act of 2000 drafted by the National \n     Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, to protect \n     student athletes and the integrity of amateur sports from \n     unscrupulous sports agents. In particular, it is the sense of \n     Congress that States should enact the provisions relating to \n     the registration of sports agents, the required form of \n     contract, the right of the student athlete to cancel an \n     agency contract, the disclosure requirements relating to \n     record maintenance, reporting, renewal, notice, warning, and \n     security, and the provisions for reciprocity among the \n     States.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FRIST (for himself, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Dodd, Mr. DeWine, \n        Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Warner, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Lugar, Ms. Landrieu, \n        Mr. Sessions, and Mr. Alexander):\n  S. 1172. A bill to establish grants to provide health services for \nimproved nutrition, increased physical activity, obesity prevention, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss a particular public \nhealth problem--the growing rates of obesity. This epidemic has \nsteadily increased to a level twice what it was thirty years ago. \nObesity now affects over sixty percent of adults and thirteen percent \nof children and adolescents. Among young people, it is escalating at an \nalarming rate. This condition causes three hundred thousand deaths a \nyear and is second only to smoking as the Nation's leading cause of \npreventable death. Overweight and obesity are associated with increased \nrisk for heart disease, the leading cause of death, cancer, the second \nleading cause of death, diabetes, the seventh leading cause of death, \nand musculoskeletal disorders. Anyone with this condition has at least \na 50 percent chance of a premature death.\n  As obesity continues to mount, the morbidity, mortality and health \ncare costs associated with these disorders will skyrocket. Just this \nlast month, a Health Affairs article estimated that nearly one-tenth of \nU.S. health care costs are attributable to conditions resulting from \nobesity or being overweight. In 2002 dollars, the authors of this \narticle estimate that obesity and overweight-related conditions cost \n$92.6 billion. Of which, half is financed by Medicare and Medicaid.\n  Healthy People 2010 calls overweight and obesity one of the Nation's \nleading health problems and prioritizes efforts to increase the \nproportion of adults who are at a healthy weight, and reduce the levels \nof obesity and overweight among adults, children and adolescents. The \nSurgeon General's report ``A Call to Action'' lists the treatment and \nprevention of obesity as a top national priority.\n  Now, if this condition was linked to an infectious or bioterrorist \nagent, the public outcry would be deafening, and the action to control \nit swift. But it is not. Obesity and being overweight is often seen as \nan individual problem and a personal choice, and thus does not receive \nmuch attention. Most people do not choose to be overweight. Overweight \nand obesity result from daily lifestyle choices that gradually \naccumulate. Weight gain occurs slowly, often unnoticed. Today, many \nAmericans struggle to control their weight, collectively spending \nbillions of dollars each year on weight loss products and programs.\n  The good news is that, with healthy eating and regular physical \nactivity, obesity is preventable and treatable. That is why I, along \nwith Senator Bingaman, Senator Dodd, and others, am reintroducing the \n``Improved Nutrition and Physical Activity, IMPACT, Act.'' I am pleased \nthat Representatives Mary Bono and Kay Granger, along with other co-\nsponsors, introduced companion legislation in the House of \nRepresentatives earlier this year. This bill will help Americans make \nhealthy decisions about nutrition and physical activity. It emphasizes \nyouth education so that healthy habits can begin early. Finally, it \nfunds demonstration projects to find innovative ways of improving \neating and exercise habits.\n  There is no single solution to the growing epidemic of obesity. That \nis why the IMPACT Act takes a multifaceted approach. It implements \nevidence-based programs, where available, and includes rigorous \nevaluation of demonstration projects so we can learn what works best. \nThis important legislation has a modest price tag, reflecting the \nappropriate role of the Federal Government. Most importantly, the \nIMPACT Act does not attempt to mandate what Americans eat or drink or \nto transfer to the Federal Government decisions that are best made at \nlocal levels.\n  Let me be clear that I am not against people making choices. I am all \nfor choice, informed choice. What has happened, though, is that we as a \nsociety and as individuals have made choices about eating and activity, \ngradually and incrementally, without understanding or considering the \nconsequences. Finally, and most importantly, this bill does not intend \nto and should not be considered to stigmatize those who struggle to \ncontrol their weight or to demonize any sector of the country by \nblaming them for this epidemic. The IMPACT Act represents a bipartisan \nagreement that the problem of obesity is important, and takes an \napproach that is supported by a broad spectrum of interested parties. \nWith the Federal Government providing assistance, all sectors of \nsociety will need to work together to help produce a healthier nation.\n  I believe we have crafted a good first response to the growing rates \nof obesity. A number of public health and industry experts support the \npassage of this important legislation. I ask unanimous consent that a \nlist of the organizations supporting the legislation and the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  I want to thank Senators Bingaman and Dodd for their work on this \nbill. I also want to thank Senator Gregg for his assistance in ensuring \nthat this legislation can become law. Senator Gregg has worked \ntirelessly with my staff to ensure that we craft legislation that can \nbe quickly passed by the Senate, and I appreciate his efforts. I look \nforward to having this bill become law this year.\n  There being no objection, the list and the bill were ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                    Groups Supporting the IMPACT Act\n\n       The Advertising Council, Inc.;\n       Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities Prevention Task \n     Force;\n       Council on State and Territorial Epidemiologists;\n       Endocrine Society;\n       FamilyCook Productions: Bringing Families Together Through \n     Fresh Food;\n       Grocery Manufacturers of America;\n       National Alliance for Nutrition and Activity;\n       National Recreation and Parks Association;\n       Research against Inactivity-related Disorders (RID);\n       Samuels & Associates: Public Health Research, Evaluation, \n     and Policy Consultants;\n       Society for Nutrition Education;\n       Structure House;\n       University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, School of \n     Public Health; and\n       YMCA.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                                S. 1172\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Improved Nutrition and \n     Physical Activity Act'' or the ``IMPACT Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) An estimated 61 percent of adults and 13 percent of \n     children and adolescents in the Nation are overweight or \n     obese.\n       (2) The prevalence of obesity and being overweight is \n     increasing among all age groups. There are twice the number \n     of overweight children and 3 times the number of overweight \n     adolescents as there were 29 years ago.\n\n[[Page S7247]]\n\n       (3) An estimated 300,000 deaths a year are associated with \n     being overweight or obese.\n       (4) Obesity and being overweight are associated with an \n     increased risk for heart disease (the leading cause of \n     death), cancer (the second leading cause of death), diabetes \n     (the 6th leading cause of death), and musculoskeletal \n     disorders.\n       (5) Individuals who are obese have a 50 to 100 percent \n     increased risk of premature death.\n       (6) The Healthy People 2010 goals identify obesity and \n     being overweight as one of the Nation's leading health \n     problems and include objectives of increasing the proportion \n     of adults who are at a healthy weight, reducing the \n     proportion of adults who are obese, and reducing the \n     proportion of children and adolescents who are overweight or \n     obese.\n       (7) Another goal of Healthy People 2010 is to eliminate \n     health disparities among different segments of the \n     population. Obesity is a health problem that \n     disproportionally impacts medically underserved populations.\n       (8) The United States Surgeon General's report ``A Call To \n     Action'' lists the treatment and prevention of obesity as a \n     top national priority.\n       (9) The estimated direct and indirect annual cost of \n     obesity in the United States is $117,000,000,000 (exceeding \n     the cost of tobacco-related illnesses) and appears to be \n     rising dramatically. This cost can potentially escalate \n     markedly as obesity rates continue to rise and the medical \n     complications of obesity are emerging at even younger ages. \n     Therefore, the total disease burden will most likely \n     increase, as well as the attendant health-related costs.\n       (10) Weight control programs should promote a healthy \n     lifestyle including regular physical activity and healthy \n     eating, as consistently discussed and identified in a variety \n     of public and private consensus documents, including ``A Call \n     To Action'' and other documents prepared by the Department of \n     Health and Human Services and other agencies.\n       (11) Eating preferences and habits are established in \n     childhood.\n       (12) Poor eating habits are a risk factor for the \n     development of eating disorders and obesity.\n       (13) Simply urging overweight individuals to be thin has \n     not reduced the prevalence of obesity and may result in other \n     problems including body dissatisfaction, low self-esteem, and \n     eating disorders.\n       (14) Effective interventions for promoting healthy eating \n     behaviors should promote healthy lifestyle and not \n     inadvertently promote unhealthy weight management techniques.\n       (15) Binge Eating is associated with obesity, heart \n     disease, gall bladder disease, and diabetes.\n       (16) Anorexia Nervosa, an eating disorder from which 0.5 to \n     3.7 percent of American women will suffer in their lifetime, \n     is associated with serious health consequences including \n     heart failure, kidney failure, osteoporosis, and death. In \n     fact, Anorexia Nervosa has the highest mortality rate of all \n     psychiatric disorders, placing a young woman with Anorexia at \n     18 times the risk of death of other women her age.\n       (17) Anorexia Nervosa and Bulimia Nervosa usually appears \n     in adolescence.\n       (18) Bulimia Nervosa, an eating disorder from which an \n     estimated 1.1 to 4.2 percent of American women will suffer in \n     their lifetime, is associated with cardiac, gastrointestinal, \n     and dental problems, including irregular heartbeats, gastric \n     ruptures, peptic ulcers, and tooth decay.\n       (19) On the 1999 Youth Risk Behavior Survey, 7.5 percent of \n     high school girls reported recent use of laxatives or \n     vomiting to control their weight.\n       (20) Binge Eating Disorder is characterized by frequent \n     episodes of uncontrolled overeating, with an estimated 2 to 5 \n     percent of Americans experiencing this disorder in a 6-month \n     period.\n       (21) Eating disorders are commonly associated with \n     substantial psychological problems, including depression, \n     substance abuse, and suicide.\n       (22) Eating disorders of all types are more common in women \n     than men.\n\n                        TITLE I--TRAINING GRANTS\n\n     SEC. 101.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Improved \nNutrition and Physical Activity or IMPACT Bill that Senator Frist has \nintroduced with myself and Senators Dodd, DeWine, Clinton, Warner, \nMurray, Lugar, Landrieu, and Sessions. This is a bill that is critical \nin this era of chronic disease, as it addresses the mounting public \nhealth concerns of obesity, overweight, eating disorders, and their \nrelated diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease.\n  Approximately 61 percent of adults and 13 percent of children and \nadolescents in our Nation today are overweight or obese. These \nindividuals have a significantly greater risk of diseases such as \ndiabetes, heart disease, and stroke than their healthy weight peers. \nAnother 5 to 10 percent of Americans are suffering from eating \ndisorders that can also manifest themselves in a number of physical and \npsychological illnesses including heart disease, osteoporosis, kidney \nfailure, depression, anxiety, and suicide. Unfortunately, these rates \nof overweight, obesity, and eating disorders are rising in both adult \nand child populations. Since obesity is a health problem that \ndisproportionately impacts medically underserved populations, it is \nrapidly increasing the medical burden on these already overburdened \npopulations.\n  The economic implications of the obesity epidemic are equally \ndisturbing. The estimated direct and indirect annual cost of obesity in \nthe United States is now 117 billion dollars--exceeding the cost of \ntobacco-related illnesses. These costs will only continue to climb \nunless we make a concerted effort to stem this dangerous tide by \ninitiating primary and secondary prevention programs.\n  It is this conclusion that led the United States Surgeon General to \nissue a Call to Action listing the treatment and prevention of obesity \nas a top national priority. It is this conclusion that has led \nSecretary Thompson to implement the Steps to a Healthier US initiative. \nAnd it is this reality that makes passing the IMPACT bill a critical \nstep towards improving our nation's future health and well-being.\n  Obesity and eating disorders are complex diseases and as such require \ncomprehensive multidisciplinary solutions. IMPACT aims to move us \ntoward those solutions by addressing these diseases on a number of \nlevels. First, it aims to prepare the health care community to deal \nwith obesity from prevention to diagnosis to intervention by adding \nobesity, overweight, and eating disorders to the list of priority \nconditions to be addressed in the health professions Title VII training \ngrants.\n  Second, IMPACT supports community-based solutions to increase \nphysical activity and improve nutrition on a number of levels. It \nprovides funding for demonstration projects in communities, schools, \nhealth care organizations, and other qualified entities that promote \nfitness or healthy nutrition. It authorizes the CDC to collect fitness \nand energy expenditure information from children. It directs AHRQ to \nreview any new information relating to obesity trends among various \nsub-populations and include such information in its health disparities \nreport. It allows states to use their Preventive Services Block Grant \nmoney for community education on nutrition and increased physical \nactivity. It instructs the Secretary to report on what research has \nbeen done in the area of obesity, what has been learned from this \nresearch, and what future research should be conducted. And finally, it \nasks the secretary to report on the effectiveness of the Youth Media \nCampaign in changing children's behaviors and reducing obesity.\n\n  IMPACT is supported by a wide variety of public and private \norganizations. The National Alliance for Nutrition and Activity or \nNANA, an organization including more than 250 national, state, and \nlocal organizations and the single largest coalition in the U.S. \ndedicated to promoting healthy eating and physical activity and \nreducing obesity states, ``NANA strongly supports your efforts to \nreduce obesity and improve eating and activity habits in the U.S. \nthrough the IMPACT bill.'' Other organizations that have stated their \nsupport include the American Heart Association, the American Cancer \nSociety, the Council for States and Territorial Epidemiologists, the \nSociety for Nutrition Education, and the American Dietetic Association.\n  This legislation is an excellent first step in the fight for improved \nhealth, but it is not the only step we must take. We need to assist our \nschools in providing healthy nutrition options and expanding physical \nactivity programs. We need to grow the workforce so that people have \naccess to the healthcare professionals they need to prevent, diagnose, \nand treat obesity and eating disorders. We need to look at Medicare and \nMedicaid and insure that they provide the services necessary to help \npeople prevent and treat obesity and its complications so that we \nreduce the burden of these diseases in these vulnerable populations. \nAnd we need to promote research in the areas of obesity prevention and \ntreatment so that we can offer people better and more effective \ninterventions in the future. These are not small goals but they are \ncritical to our nation's health. I will continue to work on additional \nlegislation that will take the next steps toward addressing these and \nother related concerns.\n  For today, I would like to ask all of my colleagues to join me in \ntaking this very important first step toward reducing obesity and \neating disorders by supporting this important legislation. By passing \nthis bill we can truly IMPACT the health of our nation.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about a \nfrightening epidemic in our Nation. A staggering 61 percent of adults \nand 13 percent of children and adolescents in our Nation are overweight \nor obese. The number of overweight children has doubled and the number \nof overweight adolescents has tripled since 1980, according to the \nSurgeon General. The estimated direct and indirect annual cost of \nobesity in the United States is $117,000,000,000, exceeding even \nsmoking-related illnesses.\n  That is why I am pleased to join Senators Frist, Bingaman, Dodd and \nothers in introducing the Improved Nutrition and Physical Activity Act \nof 2003. This bill takes important steps to fund programs that ensure \nhealthy eating behaviors and improved physical activity. Funding this \nprogram will save Americans vastly more in lower health care costs. The \nbill also takes critical steps to educate health professionals to help \nus fight this epidemic. With smoking, we learned that a simple \nrecommendation from a health professional to stop could have a dramatic \nimpact in reducing smoking. It is just as important to make sure our \nhealth care providers are equipped to help mold healthy behaviors in \nour fight against obesity.\n  I also appreciate Senator Frist's willingness to incorporate \nimportant provisions from my Promoting Healthy Eating Behaviors in \nYouth Act of 2002. While it is so important to fight the obesity \nepidemic, we should not inadvertently send the wrong message by\n\n[[Page S7250]]\n\ntelling our children and adults simply to eat less and exercise. \nUnfortunately, many adolescents misinterpret this as a message that \nthey should eat to achieve the body of a runway model. Anorexia and \nbulimia are increasingingly common among our Nation's youth. Recent \ndata from the 1999 Youth Risk Behavior Survey indicated that 7 percent \nof young women who were very thin (body mass index less than 15 \npercentile) reported taking laxatives or vomiting to lose weight or to \navoid gaining weight. An even larger percentage 9 percent of these very \nthin young women reported using diet pills.\n  While it is important to prevent diabetes and heart disease that may \nresult from obesity, eating disorders also have their own very serious \nconsequences. Anorexia nervosa, which will affect 3.7 percent of \nAmerican women sometime in their lifetime, leads to heart failure, \nkidney failure, and osteoporosis. In fact, a young woman is 12 times \nmore likely to die than other women her age without anorexia.\n\n  Poor eating habits have also led to a ``calcium crisis'' among \nAmerican youth. Very few adolescent girls (14 percent get the \nrecommended daily amount of calcium, placing them at serious risk for \nosteoporosis and other bone diseases. Because nearly 90 percent of \nadult bone mass is established by the end of adolescent growth period, \nthe Nation's youth's insufficient calcium intake is truly a calcium \ncrisis. The consequence of this crisis will be seen years later, when \nwe are likely to face an unprecedented incidence of osteoporosis in \nwomen.\n  That is why I am especially grateful to see the use of a balanced \n``healthy eating behavior'' definition in the bill, and to see that a \nportion of the grants in the bill are set aside for eating disorders \neducation programs. While we certainly need to focus on exercise and \nappropriate nutritional behavior, it is certainly just as important to \nteach our children and adults how to engage in regular physical \nexercise and lose weight in a healthy way.\n  I am proud to join Senators Frist, Bingaman, Dodd, Warner, DeWine, \nMurray, Lugar, and Landrieu in this important legislative initiative, \nand eagerly anticipate its progress as we fight a significant public \nhealth epidemic.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Frist, Mr. Graham of South \n        Carolina, Mr. Alexander, and Mrs. Hutchison):\n  S. 1173. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \naccelerate the increase in the refundability of the child tax credit, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to speak briefly about low-income \nfamilies and the recently passed tax bill. There has been much heat and \nvery little light about what we have done in this bill. Most of the \nheat has been focused on the conference decision not to retain the \nSenate position regarding acceleration from 10 percent to 15 percent as \npart of the refundable child credit--a change already scheduled to take \nplace in 2005.\n  Before I discuss this matter in detail, let me start by saying that I \nagree with my colleagues that we should seek to reconsider this \nprovision. I am introducing legislation today that will do that, and \nwill also, of equal, and perhaps greater importance, provide a uniform \ndefinition of a child and make the $1,000 child credit permanent. \nFinally, my bill will eliminate the marriage penalty that is contained \nin the child credit. This bill is an encompassing effort to help low-\nincome and middle-income families.\n  The uniform definition of a child will help hundreds of thousands of \nfamilies receive tax benefits for which they are not currently \neligible. As important, it will bring simplification and clarity for \nmillions of families, ensuring that they are not subject to IRS audit \nand collection efforts.\n  The bill also makes permanent the $1,000 child credit. Otherwise, in \n2005 working families with two eligible children will receive a $600 \ntax increase as the tax credit drops to $700. In addition, the bill \naccelerates the refundable calculation from 10 percent to 15 percent.\n  Finally, the bill addresses the marriage penalty contained in the \nchild credit. Currently, the child credit phases out at $75,000 for a \nsingle mother and a $110,000 for a married couple. My bill would \neliminate the marriage penalty by having the credit phase out at \n$150,000. In addition, it adjusts the phase-out level for inflation.\n  I do not need to wait for comments from my colleagues or from the \nmedia to take this action. Many from the media who attended my press \nconference the day of final passage of the conference report will \nrecall that I stated then that I would quickly seek to revisit the \nchild tax credit issues and seek Senate action on permanency of the \nchild credit.\n  Let me turn now to the acceleration issue. The media and some members \nof Congress seem to have a willful blindness as they discuss this \nmatter. What are they blind to? The Earned Income Credit, EIC, program \nprovides great assistance to the very population that is of concern.\n  Let me give you an example: A family of four making $11,000 will be \neligible for $50 under the refundable child credit. By accelerating it, \nas proposed by my bill and by others, they will now be eligible for \n$75. What does this family get under EIC? In 2002 they will get a check \nfor $4,140. That means that family is paying no income tax and payroll \ntax of $842 and is getting a payment from the federal government of \nalmost $3,300 in excess of the payroll tax they pay.\n  You would never know this from the media accounts and the press \nreleases. And even if there is a mention of the EIC, I have seen no \nmention of the dollar amount--the $4,00-plus check for families with \ntwo children and $2,500 for families with one child. Why is that? \nBecause the chicken littles are too busy running around. I would hope \nthat the concept of ``context'' would not be something of which the \nmedia has to be reminded. You would think from reading speeches and \nmedia accounts that the whole tax relief provided in the tax code to \na family making $11,000 is the refundable child credit. The child \ncredit for these families at this income level is a thimble compared to \nthe enormous benefits of EIC.\n\n  Let me remind my colleagues of the purpose of the child credit: It \nwas designed to address the perceived penalty for working families as \nthe EIC began to phase out. In fact, the original proposal of the \nrefundable child credit that I drafted with Senator Baucus in 2001 \nwould not have begun to take effect until the point where the EIC \nbegins to phase-out--at approximately $13,500 for a head of household \nand $14,500 for married couples.\n  The Finance Committee heard testimony, and it was the repeated view \nof academics, that Congress needed to address the phase-out of the EIC. \nThere was no testimony to the Senate Finance Committee and I can find \nvery little in respectable academic discussions that advocated an \nincrease in the check for EIC recipients--that the EIC top amount of \n$4,000 plus for two children or $2,500 for one child was insufficiently \ngenerous.\n  So that is what was the genesis of the Finance Committee's support \nfor a child credit--addressing somewhat the EIC phase-out as families \nbegin to make more money. However, the beginning point of the phase-in \nwas shifted at the request of some Senators to $10,000. That does not \nnegate that the underlying purpose was and is to deal with the EIC \nphase-out.\n  This concern about the phase-out is reflected in the actions we took \nin conference. By raising the child credit to $1,000 we helped put more \nmoney in the pocket of a single mom with one child making $17,000 to \n$20,000.\n  That single mom making $20,000 will now get a $1,000 check instead of \na $600 check under previous law.\n  What if we were to only do as some propose and do acceleration to 15 \npercent but not increase the child credit in 2005 to $1,000?\n  Yes, it will mean a bit more for those families already receiving a \n$4,000-plus check under EIC--and I recognize that every penny counts to \nthese families. But this proposal will also mean a tax increase on that \nsingle mom making $18,000, that single dad making $19,000 and that \nmarried couple with one child making $20,000. Why? Because they benefit \nmore from the increase in the child credit to $1,000. The acceleration \nwill not benefit them; they will quickly meet the maximum child credit. \nIt is the increase to $1,000 that is the real\n\n[[Page S7251]]\n\nbenefit for these families that do not receive the maximum benefits \nunder EIC.\n  That is why I urge my colleagues to support my legislation that helps \nmillions of working families, and doesn't impose a tax on families that \nare working hard and getting themselves a little bit better paying job.\n  And let me close with one other note. My colleagues should remember \nthat it still takes 3 million taxpayers off the rolls completely. They \nwill no longer have to pay tax under this legislation. Much of that is \ndue to the increase in the child credit to $1,000.\n  Finally, for those who want to talk about income tax relief for low-\nincome individuals, I would encourage them to remember this is many \nways a bill that is in concert with the 2001 tax relief that created \nthe 10 percent bracket and provided great income tax relief to singles. \nAgain, a bigger picture that provides greater context of our work will \nshow that we are providing broad-based relief to millions of taxpayers.\n  I urge my colleagues to work with me in passing this full relief for \nfamilies. I also think it is important that we pass legislation that \ncan be passed into law by working with the House and the White House. \nWe have already passed legislation that deals with just the 10 percent \nto 15 percent--the Finance Committee passed it and the Senate passed \nit. The Senate is on record on this matter already. Now is the time to \nbring real relief and permanent relief to all working families.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. STABENOW (for herself, Mr. Smith, and Mr. Dayton):\n  S. 1175. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \nrefundable credit against income tax for the purchase of a principal \nresidence by a first-time homebuyer; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I believe ``home'' is one of the warmest \nwords in the English language. At the end of a long day, I think the \nfavorite phrase of every hardworking working man and woman in this \ncountry is: ``Well, I'll see you tomorrow. I'm going home now.''\n  That is why I rise today to introduce the First Time Homebuyers' Tax \nCredit Act of 2003.\n  The bill I am introducing will spread that warmth by opening the door \nto homeownership to millions of hardworking families, helping them \ncover the initial down payment and closing costs.\n  This initiative is in keeping with our longstanding national policy \nof encouraging homeownership.\n  Owning a home has always been a fundamental part of the American \ndream.\n  We, in Congress, have long recognized the social and economic value \nin high rates of homeownership through laws that we have enacted, such \nas the mortgage interest tax deduction and the capital gains exclusion \non the sale of a home.\n  Over the life of a loan, the mortgage interest tax deduction can save \nhomeowners thousands of dollars that they could use for other necessary \nfamily expenses such as education or health care.\n  These benefits, however, are only available to individuals who own \ntheir own home.\n  It is important also to note that owning a home is a principle and \nreliable source of savings as homeowners build equity over the years \nand their homes appreciate.\n  For many people, it is home equity--not stocks--that help them \nthrough the retirement years.\n  In addition, owning a home insulates people from spikes in housing \ncosts.\n  Indeed, while rents may go up, the costs of a monthly mortgage \npayment, in relative terms, will go down over the course of the \nmortgage.\n  In my own State of Michigan, the homeownership rate of 74 percent is \nthe third highest in the Nation and well above the national rate of 66 \npercent.\n  In Oregon, the home State of my bill's lead Republican sponsor, \nSenator Gordon Smith, the homeownership rate is 64.3 percent--about 2 \npercent below the national average.\n  However, as impressive as these numbers may initially sound, not \neveryone enjoys the benefits of homeownership.\n  For example, homeownership in Michigan among whites is 78 percent; \nNative Americans 60 percent; Hispanics 55 percent; African Americans 51 \npercent; and Asians 50 percent.\n  A national study by the Fannie Mae Foundation found that in the top \nthird of income levels, 44 percent of people under the age of 31 owned \ntheir own home.\n  But, for the lowest third on the income scale, only 15.6 percent \nowned their own home--a 28 percent gap!\n  Why do we face these disparities? Clearly, one of the biggest \nbarriers to homeownership for working families is the cost of a down \npayment and the costs associated with closing a mortgage.\n  According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, typical closing costs \non an average sized loan of $175,000 can approach approximately $4,000.\n  Even with relatively recent mortgage products that allow a \ndownpayment of as little as 3 percent of the value of a home, total \ncosts can quickly approach over $9,000.\n  This is an impossible amount to save for those who are scraping by, \nworking hard to make ends meet.\n  To address this problem, I am introducing the First Time Homebuyers' \nTax Credit Act of 2003.\n  My bill authorizes a one-time tax credit of up to $3,000 for \nindividuals and $6,000 for married couples.\n  This credit is similar to the existing mortgage interest tax \ndeduction in that it creates incentives for people to buy a home.\n  To be eligible for the credit, taxpayers must be first-time \nhomebuyers who were within the 27 percent tax bracket or lower in the \nyear before they purchase their home. That is $67,700 for single \nfilers, $96,700 for heads of household, $112,850 for joint returns. \nThere is a dollar-for-dollar phase-out beyond the cap.\n  Normally, tax credits like this are an after-the-fact benefit. They \ndo little to get people actually into a home.\n  What is particularly innovative and beneficial about the tax credit \nin this bill, however, is that, for the first time, the taxpayer can \neither claim the credit in the year after he or she buys a first home \nor the taxpayer can transfer the credit directly to a lender at \nclosing.\n  The transferred credit would go toward helping with the down payment \nor closing costs. This is cash at the table.\n  As mandated in the bill, the eligible homebuyer would have the money \nfor the lender from the Treasury within 30 days of application.\n  I am happy to say that this legislation already has strong support. \nAmong those who have already written to me in support of this concept \nare:\n  The American Bankers Association; America's Community Bankers; the \nHousing Partnership Network; the National Housing Conference; the \nNational Congress for Community Economic Development; the National \nCouncil of La Raza; the National Association of Affordable Housing \nLenders; the Manufactured Housing Institute; Fannie Mae; Freddie Mac; \nNational Community Reinvestment Coalition; Standard Federal Bank; \nHabitat for Humanity, and, the National American Indian Housing \nCouncil.\n  I ask unanimous consent that copies of their letters be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record.\n\n                                                       Habitat for\n\n\n                                       Humanity International,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 12, 2003.\n     Hon. Debbie Stabenow,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Stabenow: On behalf of Habitat for Humanity \n     International, I want to commend you for your leadership on \n     issues of affordable housing and for putting forth \n     legislation--the First-Time Homebuyers Tax Credit Act--that \n     will enable low-income families with little or no savings to \n     overcome the two largest obstacles faced on the path to \n     homeownership; downpayments and closing costs.\n       As you know, Habitat for Humanity has witnessed, through \n     the sale of over 135,000 homes worldwide to Habitat homeowner \n     families, that homeownership is one of the most important \n     personal and financial investments for individuals, families, \n     and communities. By expanding first-time homeownership \n     opportunities to thousands of low-income families via a one-\n     time tax credit, the First-Time Homebuyers Tax Credit Act \n     will help close the homeownership gap and provide new wealth-\n     building opportunities for thousands who would perhaps in no \n     other way experience the American Dream.\n       Habitat for Humanity affiliates across the country address \n     the issue of daunting financial barriers posed by \n     downpayments and\n\n[[Page S7252]]\n\n     closing costs by charging only a minimal amount or by \n     enabling potential homeower families to forgo the requirement \n     altogether, relying on a homeowner's ``sweat equity'' in the \n     construction of their home as sufficient deposit. While this \n     legislation may not directly affect the work of our Habitat \n     affiliates, HFHI is pleased to offer our support to you as we \n     work together to provide new homeownership opportunities to \n     strengthen families, revitalize neighborhoods, and close the \n     homeownership gap among racial groups.\n       Again, we applaud your commitment to affordable housing \n     issues and for sponsoring legislation that reflects your \n     conviction that all Americans should have a decent, safe, and \n     affordable place in which to live. If we can be of any \n     assistance, please do not hestitate to contact me or Amy \n     Randel, Director of Government Relations, at 202/628-9171.\n           Gratefully yours,\n                                                        Tom Jones,\n     Vice President, HFHI/Managing Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                        Standard Federal Bank,\n\n                                         Troy, MI, March 27, 2003.\n     Hon. Debbie A. Stabenow,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Stabenow: Standard Federal Bank National \n     Association (``SFB'') appreciates the opportunity to comment \n     on the proposed First-Time Homebuyers' Tax Credit Act of \n     2003. This letter is written on behalf of SFB and all of its \n     LaSalle Bank Corporation (``LBC'') affiliates.\n       LBC is a subsidiary of ABN AMRO Bank N.V. (``Bank'') which \n     is headquartered in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The Bank has \n     over $519 billion in assets, approximately 111,000 employees, \n     and a network of approximately 3,500 offices in over 70 \n     countries and territories. The Bank maintains several \n     branches, agencies and offices in the United States. In \n     addition, ABN AMRO Incorporated, a full-service investment \n     banking, advisory, and brokerage firm, headquartered in New \n     York, New York, is also a subsidiary of the Bank.\n       LBC is the financial holding company for the U.S. domestic \n     banking operations of the Bank and is headquartered in \n     Chicago. LBC is among the largest foreign financial holding \n     companies in North America with $90 billion in assets. The \n     U.S. operations of the Bank include LaSalle Bank National \n     Association, located in Chicago, Illinois, and Standard \n     Federal Bank National Association, located in Troy, Michigan. \n     These banks maintain over 400 offices in Illinois, Michigan, \n     and Indiana.\n       The advantages of home ownership are both obvious and \n     clearly instrumental in providing a secure lifestyle to our \n     citizens. Owning one's own home is the primary source of \n     wealth building for most Americans. While rents and other \n     living expenses increase with inflation, the monthly mortgage \n     payment can remain constant, and in relative terms will \n     become an even smaller portion of the family's financial \n     obligations over time.\n       An additional benefit to home ownership is the mortgage \n     interest tax deduction. Home owners can use the money they \n     save on taxes to meet other family expense, such as education \n     and health care, benefits which are not available to renters.\n       We want to express our strong support for the concept of \n     expanding homeownership opportunities contained in the \n     proposed First-Time Homebuyers' Tax Credit Act of 2003, which \n     you have been instrumental in brining up for Congressional \n     approval. This legislation has the potential to provide a \n     significant opportunity for home ownership to many families \n     and individuals who are not able to meet the financial burden \n     of down payment and closing costs. The First Time Homebuyers' \n     Tax Credit, perhaps used in conjunction with other available \n     federal, state, and local homebuyers' incentive programs, \n     will bring the dream of owning one's own home well within the \n     grasp of many additional people.\n       We understand that some details of the program, \n     particularly as it relates to the transfer of the tax credit \n     to a lender, remain to be worked out. However, we are \n     supportive of the concept of the tax credit and of income \n     limits for participation.\n       We appreciate the opportunity to comment on this important \n     legislation and congratulate you for providing leadership to \n     this effort. We hope that our comments and our support will \n     assist in bringing the tax credit program to fruition for the \n     benefit of first time homebuyers.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Mary M. Fowlie,\n     Group Senior Vice President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                National Community\n\n\n                                       Reinvestment Coalition,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 18, 2003.\n     Hon.

In addition, we are truly grateful to you \n     regarding your leadership in authoring ``The First Time \n     Homebuyers Tax Credit Act of 2003'', and we applaud you as a \n     champion for this cause. We would like for you to know that \n     we stand willing and anxious to assist you in the \n     introduction of this bill in the 108th Congress.\n       Again, thank you for your pioneering spirit and continued \n     support in assisting those who have encountered economic \n     injustices.

Downpayment and closing costs have \n     consistently been one of the greatest barriers to \n     homeownership for low and moderate-income families.\n       NCCED is the national trade association representing more \n     than 3,600 CDCs nationwide. We were founded in 1970 and since \n     have advocated for the community economic development \n     industry, whose work creates wealth, builds healthy and \n     sustainable communities, and achieves lasting economic \n     viability. NCCED fulfills its mission of service to its \n     members working in disinvested urban and rural communities \n     through education, resource development, advocacy, \n     networking, training, technology assistance, policy \n     initiatives, and strategic partnerships.\n       NCCED's annual conference will be held this year in \n     Detroit, Michigan on October 9 and 10, 2003. We would welcome \n     the opportunity for you to share your thoughts with the \n     expected 500 conference attendees who will be there to learn \n     from the successes of Detroit's community development \n     corporations.\n       Please contact me at (202) 289-9020 if you would like more \n     information.

This legislation would \n     authorize a one-time tax credit of up to $3,000 for \n     individuals and $6,000 for married couples to help pay \n     downpayment and closing costs for eligible first-time \n     homebuyers.\n       The lack of funds for downpayment and closing costs is a \n     significant barrier for many lower income families who wish \n     to purchase a home in communities throughout the country. The \n     proposed homeownership credit is a particularly innovative \n     solution to help families overcome this obstacle because of \n     the transferability feature. By allowing buyers to transfer \n     the credit to their mortgage lender at closing, the credit \n     can provide an immediate infusion of cash to help the family \n     finance the home purchase.\n       Founded in 1990, the Housing Partnership Network is a \n     national membership intermediary for regional nonprofit \n     housing partnerships. The Network currently has 77 members \n     operating in 37 states. (The full membership list is \n     attached.) The Network and our members sponsor a range of \n     programs to provide counseling, mortgage finance, and \n     downpayment assistance to promote affordable homeownerships \n     opportunities for low and moderate income families. The \n     Network's members have provided homeownership counseling to \n     over 225,000 families and have developed or rehabilitated \n     200,000 homes.\n       The Network is a national funding intermediary for the HUD \n     Housing Counseling Program, and has provided $8 million to \n     support the counseling programs of 35 organizations over the \n     last eight years. Focused primarily on homebuyer education, \n     the program underwrites a range of services, including post-\n     purchase, foreclosure prevention, and reverse equity mortgage \n     counseling. There are also homeless assistance and renter \n     counseling components.\n       Our member that operates in the Washington, DC area, the \n     Community Development and Preservation Corporation, is \n     familiar with the federally authorized homeownership tax \n     credit in the District of Columbia. This program has been \n     quite successful and your bill would extend this benefit to \n     many other communities. The innovative\n\n[[Page S7253]]\n\n     transferability feature which you have included in the \n     legislation will make this resource even more useful to first \n     time homebuyers.\n       The proposed credit is a creative approach to use the tax \n     system to facilitate homeownership for lower income families. \n     As this bill makes its way through the legislative process, \n     we would recommend that the income eligibility for the credit \n     be more narrowly drawn to ensure the public resource is more \n     efficiently targeted to lower income beneficaries.\n       We appreciate the leadership you have provide in helping \n     address the nation's affordable housing crisis, and look \n     forward to working with you and your staff on this and other \n     issues.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Thomas Bledsoe,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                  National Council of La Raza,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 21, 2003.\n     Hon. Deborah Stabenow,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Stabenow: On behalf of the National Council of \n     La Raza (NCLR), I write in support of the First-Time \n     Homebuyers' Tax Credit Act of 2003. NCLR is the nation's \n     largest Hispanic constituency-based organization, \n     representing more than 37 million Latinos nationwide. The \n     opportunity to become a homeowner is essential to NCLR's \n     mission to promote economic mobility and financial stability \n     within the Hispanic community.\n       As you may know, Latino representation within the \n     homebuying market is increasing, accounting for 16.3% of all \n     new homebuyers from 1995 to 2000. That said, we remain \n     concerned that the rate of Hispanic homeownership, 48% \n     continues to lag behind the national average of 68%.\n       Homeownership is often the largest and single most \n     important asset for a family, building wealth and improving \n     community stability. Further initiatives that facilitate \n     homeownership opportunities are essential for improving \n     Hispanic and low-income neighborhoods. Too many working \n     Latino families are unable to save enough money for closing \n     costs and downpayments, and are barred from attaining the \n     American dream of homeownership. Legislation such as yours \n     will break down barriers to homeownership, of which \n     affordability is a major component.\n       NCLR looks forward to working with you on this and other \n     innovative affordable housing efforts. Please contact Janis \n     Bowdler, Housing Policy Analyst, (202) 776-1748, to discuss \n     further ways in which we can work together on these important \n     issues.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Raul Yzaguirre,\n     President/CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                   Affordable Housing Lenders,\n\n                                                   March 12, 2003.\n     Hon. Debbie A. Stabenow,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Stabenow: The National Association of \n     Affordable Housing Lenders (NAAHL), which represent America's \n     leaders in community lending and investment, strongly \n     supports the proposed First-Time Homebuyers' Tax Credit Act \n     of 2003, to help working families buy their first home \n     through a tax credit to help cover the downpayment and \n     closing costs.\n       NAAHL is the only association devoted to increasing private \n     capital investment in low- and moderate-income communities. \n     NAAHL represents 200 organizations that are leaders in \n     lending and investing, including more than 70 insured \n     depository institutions, 45 non-profit providers and 800 \n     individuals. Members include the who's who of private sector \n     lenders and investors in affordable housing and community \n     development: banks, thrifts, insurance companies, community \n     development corporations, mortgage companies, loan consortia, \n     financial intermediaries, pension funds, foundations, local \n     and national nonprofits, and public agencies.\n       As you well know, the number of working families with \n     critical housing needs has continued to grow in recent years, \n     and working families have identified the lack of affordable \n     housing as one of their biggest problems. The First-Time \n     Homebuyers' Tax Credit Act would make it significantly easier \n     for many households to realize the American dream of \n     homeownership by providing them with a valuable resource for \n     overcoming one of the biggest barriers to homeownership--the \n     cost of a downpayment and closing costs.\n       The proposed legislation evolves from longstanding public \n     policy to create incentives to homeownership because of the \n     inherent benefits of homeownership for both individuals and \n     society. Your bill effectively complements the existing \n     mortgage interest tax deduction--which saves families \n     thousands of dollars for other necessary expenditures after a \n     home has been acquired--by providing a tax credit that \n     facilitates the first-time purchase of a home for working \n     families. The legislation also addresses another key concern, \n     narrowing the homeownership gap between the lowest and \n     highest income groups, and among different races.\n       NAAHL and our member companies look forward to working \n     closely with you to enact this legislation. We share your \n     goal of expanding homeownership opportunities, and sincerely \n     appreciate your commitment to helping make housing more \n     affordable.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Judy Kennedy,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               Manufactured Housing Institute,\n\n                                                   March 18, 2003.\n     Hon. Debbie A. Stabenow,\n     Senate Hart Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Stabenow: The Manufactured Housing Institute \n     (MHI) supports the ``First-Time Homebuyers' Tax Credit Act of \n     2003,'' which we understand you will be introducing in the \n     near future.\n       This legislation would permit a one-time tax-credit to \n     first-time homebuyers which can be used for down payment and \n     closing costs in connection with the purchase of a principal \n     residence. This will help credit-worthy homebuyers overcome \n     the biggest impediment to purchasing a first home today--the \n     accumulation of sufficient funds to finance the down payment \n     and closing costs required at loan settlement.\n       If structured properly, this program will help credit-\n     worthy low- and moderate-income homebuyers to purchase and \n     remain in manufactured homes for many years to come.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Chris Stinebert,\n     President, Manufactured Housing Institute.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                   Fannie Mae,\n\n                                                     May 13, 2003.\n     Hon. Debbie Stabenow,\n     Senate Hart Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Stabenow: I understand that you will be \n     introducing a bill shortly that would provide for a one-time \n     tax credit for first time homebuyers in America's lowest tax \n     brackets.\n       Your legislation, The Homeownership Tax Credit Act of 2003, \n     providing a tax credit of up to $3,000 for moderate-income \n     individuals, is the kind of assistance low and moderate \n     income families can harness to better afford the American \n     Dream of homeownership.\n       As you know, the availability of funds for a downpayment is \n     a key barrier to homeownership. Our National Housing Survey \n     found that 32 percent of Americans say they would have \n     difficulty making a downpayment for the purchase of a home. \n     We at Fannie Mae support the use of tax credits to promote \n     homeownership and appreciate your work in this regard.\n       We look forward to continuing our work with you to increase \n     the opportunity for more Americans to own homes of their own.\n           Sincerely,\n     William R. Daley.\n                                  ____\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 12, 2003\n     Hon. Debbie A. Stabenow,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Stabenow: I am writing to commend your efforts \n     in introducing the ``FIRST-TIME HOMEBUYERS' TAX CREDIT ACT OF \n     2003''. Your legislation providing a tax credit to assist \n     first-time homebuyers with closing costs or down payment \n     assistance is very important\n       Becasue of innovative products and services offered by the \n     banking industry, the United States has achieved the highest \n     homeownership rate in our nation's history. Nevertheless, as \n     you have recognized, millions still face barriers to \n     homeownership because of difficulty in accumulating an \n     adequate down-payment or because of costs associated with the \n     loan transaction. By providing assistance in the form of a \n     Federal tax rebate, paid before a borrower closes on a loan, \n     your legislation can make homeownership a reality for many \n     more Americans.\n       Thank you for your leadership on this issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Floyd E.

Debbie Stabenow,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Hart Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Stabenow: Freddie Mac is pleased to support \n     your legislation, The Homeownership Tax Credit Act of 2003. \n     We appreciate your extraordinary leadership in broadening \n     homeownership opportunities for America's working families \n     and look forward to continuing to work with you to achieve \n     this common goal.\n       The Homeownership Tax Credit Act addresses one of the \n     primary barriers that many working families and other \n     Americans face in trying to buy a home, the cost of a down \n     payment and the closing costs involved in the purchase of a \n     home. Your legislation takes an innovative approach to \n     knocking down this barrier to homeownership by providing a \n     tax credit that the taxpayer can either claim in the year \n     after he or she buys a first home or the taxpayer can \n     transfer the credit directly to a lender at closing.\n       At Freddie Mac, we work to help America's families realize \n     the dream of homeownership, by making low-cost mortgage \n     financing available to families every day. Freddie Mac has \n     made mortgage financing available for more than 27 million \n     homes. We are strongly committed to improving the quality of \n     life for homeowners and renters by making decent, accessible \n     housing a reality for America's families.\n\n[[Page S7254]]\n\n       As a member of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and \n     Urban Affairs, you have consistently demonstrated your \n     outstanding support for increasing homeownership in America, \n     and we look forward to working with you to help America's \n     families realize the American Dream of homeownership.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Dwight Fettig,\n     Director, Congressional Relations.\n                                  ____\n\n         National American Indian Housing Council, Office of \n           Governmental Affairs,\n                                       Washington, DC, May 8, 2003\n     Hon. Debbie Stabenow,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Stabenow: I write today to let you know that \n     you have the support of the National American Indian Housing \n     Council for your Homeownership Tax Credit bill. We will be \n     watching for when the bill is introduced so we can be sure to \n     inform our members.\n       The National American Indian Housing Council is a national \n     membership organization representing over 400 of the 564 \n     federally-recognized tribes and their tribally designated \n     housing entities on low-income housing, mortgage lending, \n     finance and economic development issues. We currently have \n     ten member tribes from your home state of Michigan.\n       Although much of our effort goes to helping tribal housing \n     agencies build and finance homes for tribal members where the \n     real estate market is nearly non-existent, we are always \n     looking to help those tribal members that are ready and able \n     for homeownership, but are driven away by high down-payments \n     and closing costs associated with buying a home. Your idea to \n     offer a transferable tax credit to first-time homebuyers \n     would be very helpful. We believe in the benefits of \n     homeownership and support your effort for making it less \n     cumbersome for lower income Americans.\n       Please do not hesitate to contact me for further \n     information or for any assistance you might need in the \n     passage of this legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Russell Sossamon,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     June 3, 2003.\n     Hon. Debbie Stabenow,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Stabenow: I want to take this opportunity to \n     express America's Community Bankers' support for your \n     initiative to provide Americans the opportunity to own their \n     own home. The First Time Homebuyers' Tax Credit Act of 2003 \n     is greatly needed to address the current affordable housing \n     crisis in this country.\n       Homeownership is an important goal for ACB. Our members \n     originate more than 25 percent of all U.S. mortgages. This \n     legislation will assist first-time homebuyers and lenders by \n     converting federal income tax credits into cash for down \n     payments and closing fees. We support giving qualified first-\n     time buyers the option of either handing over their credit to \n     their lenders or using it later to reduce their own personal \n     income taxes.\n       Over the years, ACB members have helped people with owning \n     a home. Your initiative will create additional opportunities \n     for our members to continue assisting first-time homebuyers \n     in securing a mortgage.\n       ACB urges your colleagues in the House of Representatives \n     to support this legislation and increase the number of new \n     American homeowners. We applaud your efforts in offering a \n     solution to a problem many Americans face.\n       Thank you for your leadership on this issue.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              Robert R. Davis,\n\n                             Executive Vice President and Managing\n                                   Director, Government Relations.\n\n  Earlier today, at a press conference, Senator Smith and I were also \njoined by the Mortgage Bankers Association of America and we have \nreceived positive comments from the National Association of \nHomebuilders about my legislation.\n  Clearly, the breadth and diversity of support is strong for this \nlegislation.\n  This is a bold and aggressive effort to reach out to a large number \nof working families to help them get into this first home.\n  The Joint Committee on Taxation has estimated that up to 16.8 million \nworking people would get into their first home over the next seven \nyears because of this new tax credit.\n  People like Christine Nelson, with whom I met this morning. Christine \nis a working mom. She works as an administrative assistant for a \nnational association. She is carefully saving up to buy her first home.\n  In addition to supporting her daughter, however, Christine has \nstudent loans that she is paying for.\n  These multiple obligations make it difficult for her to come up with \nthat $9,000 I mentioned earlier.\n  The $3,000 tax credit she is eligible for would make a tremendous \ndifference in her life. It would get her and her daughter into that \nfirst home much faster.\n  We are working to send a message to Christine and other people all \nover the country that if you are working hard to save up enough to get \ninto that first home, the Federal Government will make a strategic \ninvestment in your family--it will offer a hand up.\n  This is not unlike what we already do through the mortgage interest \ntax deduction for millions of people who are fortunate enough already \nto own their own home.\n  We certainly won't do all the hard work for you. You must be frugal \nand save and do most of the work yourself, but we, in Congress, \nunderstand that it is good for America to enhance homeownership.\n  We also understand that this sort of investment in working families \nstimulates the economy.\n  No one can deny that when the First Time Homebuyers' Tax Credit is \nenacted and used by millions of people, every single time the credit is \nused, it will be stimulative.\n  Why?\n  Because it means someone bought a house. And that generates economic \nactivity for multiple small business people. Realtors. Lenders. House \nappraisers. Inspectors. Title insurers. And so on. And there is a \nripple of economic activity by the new homeowners as they fix up their \nnew homes and get settled in.\n  Housing has been such a bright light in the sluggish economy we've \nfaced for the last few years. My bill is designed to ensure that the \nhousing sector remains a strong component of our economy.\n  Finally, let me close by emphasizing how happy and proud I am that \nthis tax legislation is bipartisan. In a closely divided Senate, and a \nclosely divided Congress, it is so important to work across the aisle \nand Senator Smith, who is a real champion for good housing policy, is \nsomeone I want to work closely with on this bill and other important \nhousing legislation. He understands how housing tax benefits help build \nstrong communities and provide economic security for millions of \nfamilies.\n  I am committed to seeing this legislation passed. And, I welcome the \nchance to work with all of my colleagues to see the dream of \nhomeownership expanded to all people.\n  Home. Sentimentally, it is one of the warmest words in the English \nlanguage. Economically, it is the key word in bringing millions of \nfamilies in from the cold and letting them begin building wealth for \nthemselves and their family.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1175\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to complete construction of the 13-State Appalachian \ndevelopment highway system, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation designed \nto fulfill an important promise made by the Federal Government to the \npeople of my State and my region some 38 years ago. I am speaking of \nthe promise to build and complete a network of highways through the \nAppalachian region known today as the Appalachian Development Highway \nSystem or ADHS. I look forward to working with my fellow Senators to \nhave my legislation included in the measure to reauthorize the Federal-\naid Highway Program, one of the most important, if not the most \nimportant, pieces of legislation which will be considered during this \nCongress. The Federal-aid Highway Program is at the very core of the \nFederal infrastructure investment exercise.\n  On September 30 of last year, our very capable Federal Highway \nAdministrator, Ms. Mary Peters, testified before the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works on the condition and performance of our \nNational Highway System. The Administration's Conditions and \nPerformance Report has\n\n[[Page S7256]]\n\nagain reminded us that a great deal more needs to be invested in our \ninfrastructure if we are not to fall further and further behind in \nstemming the deterioration of our nation's highways and bridges and \nalleviating congestion on our nation's roads.\n  At the September 30 hearing, Administrator Peters testified that, \neven in the wake of the historic funding increase accomplished through \nTEA-21, congestion on our roads continues to worsen. An investment in \nour highway infrastructure by all levels of government will have to \nincrease by more than 65 percent or $42.2 billion per year to actually \nimprove the condition of our nation's highways. A funding increase of \nmore than 17 percent or $11.3 billion will be necessary simply to \nmaintain the current inadequate conditions of our highway network, \nwhere more than one in four of our nation's bridges are classified as \ndeficient.\n  Having served as both Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate \nAppropriations Committee, I have sought to do my part by championing \nthe highest level of Federal highway investment for all fifty States \nthat is possible under our budget constraints. Earlier this year, I am \npleased to report that the Senate prevailed in the conference with the \nHouse on the Omnibus Appropriations Bill for Fiscal Year 2003 and \nrejected every penny of the $8.6 billion cut in highway funding \nproposed by President Bush. And just last month, I was pleased to join \nwith Senators Bond and Reid, the respective Chairman and Ranking Member \nof the Surface Transportation Subcommittee, in sponsoring a bipartisan \namendment to the Budget Resolution for Fiscal Year 2004 that boosted \nfunding for our Federal-aid Highway Program by several billion dollars. \nThat amendment commanded 79 votes on the Senate floor.\n  While serving in the other body, I had the great privilege of casting \nmy vote in favor of establishing the Interstate highway System back in \n1958. However, in 1964, it was recognized by the first Appalachian \nRegional Commission that while the Interstate Highway System was slated \nto provide historic economic benefits to most of our Nation, the system \nwas designed to bypass the Appalachian Region due to the extremely high \ncost associated with building Highways through Appalachia's rugged \ntopography. As a result, the construction of the interstates would have \nhad the detrimental effect of drawing passengers and freight, and the \naccompanying economic benefits, away from the Appalachian Region.\n  In 1965, the Congress adopted the Appalachian Regional Development \nAct that promised a network of modern highways to connect the \nAppalachian Region to the rest of the Nation's highway network and, \neven more importantly, the rest of the Nation's economy. Absent the \nAppalachian Development Highway System, my region of the country would \nhave been left solely with a transportation infrastructure of \ndangerous, narrow, winding roads which follow the path of river valleys \nand stream beds between mountains. These roads are still, more often \nthan not, two-lane roads that are squeezed into very limited rights-of-\nway. They are characterized by low travel speeds and long travel \ndistances and are often built to inadequate design standards.\n  One of the observations contained in Administrator Peters' testimony \nback in September that especially caught my eye was her statement that \n``the condition of higher-order roads, such as interstates, has \nimproved considerably since 1993 while the condition on many lower-\norder roads has deteriorated.'' It appears that the pattern of road \nconditions is beginning to mirror the distribution of wealth in our \ncountry, whereby the rich are getting richer while the poor get poorer. \nThat observation is most pertinent when you consider the challenge of \ncompleting the Appalachian Development Highway System.\n  We have virtually completed the construction of the Interstate \nHighway System and have moved on to many other important transportation \ngoals. However, the people of my region are still waiting for the \nFederal Government to live up to its promise, made some 38 years ago, \nto complete the ADHS. The system is still less than 80 percent complete \nand I regret to observe that my home State of West Virginia is below \nthe average for the entire Appalachian Region with only 72 percent of \nits mileage complete and open to traffic.\n\n  The rationale behind the completion of the Appalachian Development \nHighway System is no less sound today than it was in 1964. \nUnfortunately, there are still children in Appalachia who lack decent \ntransportation routes to school; and there are still pregnant mothers, \nelderly citizens and others who lack timely road access to area \nhospitals. There are thousands upon thousands of people who cannot \nobtain sustainable well-paying jobs because of poor road access to \nmajor employment centers. The entire status of the Appalachian \nDevelopment Highway System is laid out in great detail in the Cost to \nComplete Report for 2002 recently completed by the Appalachian Regional \nCommission. This is the most comprehensive report on the status of the \nAppalachian Development Highway System to date and I commend the staff \nof the Appalachian Regional Commission for their hard work on this \nreport. The last report was completed in 1997 just prior to \nCongressional consideration of TEA-21.\n  The enactment of TEA-21 signaled a new day in the advancement of the \nAppalachian Development Highway System. Through the work of the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works, the House Transportation and \nInfrastructure Committee, and the Administration, we took a great leap \nforward by authorizing direct contract authority from the Highway Trust \nFund to the States for the construction of the ADHS. Up until that \npoint, funding for the Appalachian Development Highway System had been \nlimited to uncertain and inconsistent general fund appropriations. By \nprovding the States of the Appalachian Region with a consistent and \npredictable source of funds to move forward on its uncompleted ADHS \nsegments, TEA-21 served to reinvigorate our efforts to honor the \npromise made to the people of the Appalachian Region.\n  As is made clear in the Cost to Complete Report, this initiative has \nbeen a great success. States are making greater progress toward the \ncompletion of the system than they have in any five-year segment in \nrecent memory. Since the last Cost to Complete Report, 183 miles of the \nsystem have been opened to traffic and we have successfully brought \ndown the cost to complete the system by roughly $1.7 billion in Federal \nfunds.\n  Back when we were debating TEA-21, some questions were asked as to \nhow committed the States would be to completing the unfinished segments \nto the Appalachian Development Highway System. I am pleased to report \nthat the 13 States, to date, have succeeded in obligating just under 90 \npercent of the obligation authority that has been granted to them for \nthe completion of the system. A 90-percent obligation rate compares \nquite favorably to some of the other transportation programs through \nwhich the States were granted multiple years to obligate their funds.\n  According to the ARC's Cost to Complete Report, the remaining Federal \nfunds needed to complete the ADHS are now estimated to be $4.467 \nbillion. When adjusted for inflation over the life of the next highway \nbill, using the standard inflation calculation for highway projects, a \ntotal of $5.04 billion will need to be authorized to complete the \nsystem. That is a lot of money and I believe that figure deserves some \nexplanation.\n  The considerable cost of completing the last 20 percent of the ADHS \nis explained by the fact that the easiest segments of the system to \nbuild have already been built. Much of the costs associated with \ncompleting the most difficult unfinished segments are driven by the \nrequirement to comply with other Federal laws, especially the laws \nrequiring environmental mitigation measures when building new highways \nthrough rural areas. While the $5.04 billion figure may seem large to \nsome of my colleagues, I would remind them the last highway bill \nauthorized more than $218 billion in federal infrastructure investment \nover six years. It is my sincere hope and expectation that the next \nhighway bill will authorize an even greater amount.\n  Of critical importance to this debate is the fact that the unfinished \nsegments of the ADHS represent some of most dangerous and most \ndeficient roadways in our entire Nation. Often lost in our debate over \nthe necessity to\n\n[[Page S7257]]\n\ninvest in our highways is the issue of safety. The Federal Highway \nAdministration has published reports indicating that substandard road \nconditions are a factor in 30 percent of all fatal highway accidents. I \nam quite certain that the percentage is a great deal higher in the \nAppalachian Region.\n  The Federal Highway Administration found that upgrading two-lane \nroads to four-lane divided highways decreased fatal car accidents by 71 \npercent and that the widening of traffic lanes has served to reduce \nfatalities by 21 percent. These are precisely the kind of road \nimprovements that are funded through the ADHS. In my state, the largest \nsegment of unfinished Appalachian Highway, if completed, will replace \nthe second most dangerous segment of roadway in West Virginia. So, even \nthose who would question the wisdom of completing these highways in the \nname of economic development should take a hard look at the fact that \nthe people of rural Appalachia are taking their lives in their hands \nevery day as they drive on dangerous roads.\n\n  It is time for this Congress, in concert with the Administration, to \ntake the last great leap forward and authorize sufficient contract \nauthority to finally complete the Appalachian Development Highway \nSystem. If we enact another six-year highway bill with sufficient funds \nto complete the system, we will finally pay the full costs of the ADHS \nalmost 45 years after the system was first promised to the people of my \nregion. The legislation I am introducing today, the ``Appalachian \nDevelopment Highway System Completion Act,'' will provide sufficient \ncontract authority to complete the system. Importantly, it will \nguarantee that the states of the Appalachian Region do not pay a \npenalty, either through the distribution of minimum allocation funds, \nor the distribution of obligation limitation, for receiving sufficient \nfunds to complete the Appalachian system.\n  I am very pleased that this Administration has taken on the goal of \ncompleting the ADHS. In her letter accompanying the Cost to Complete \nReport, Administrator Peters said ``the completion of the ADHS is an \nimportant part of the mission of the Federal Highway Administration. We \nconsider the accessibility, mobility and economic stimulation provided \nby the ADHS to be entirely consistent with the goals of our agency.'' \nMs. Peters further stated that the Appalachian Regional Commission's \n2002 Cost to Complete Report, ``provides a sound basis for apportioning \nfuture funding to complete the system.'' I thank Mary Peters and the \nentire Federal Highway Administration for their leadership on this \nissue and I look forward to working with Ms. Peters and her agency to \nensure that this commitment is borne out in the transportation \nreauthorization legislation that is developed by the Congress.\n  Completion of a new highway bill will be a mammoth task for this \nCongress. As I look back over the many years of my public career, one \nof the accomplishments of which I am most proud was my amendment \nproviding an additional $8 billion in funding to break the logjam \nduring the debate on the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency \nAct in 1991. Another was my sponsorship of the Byrd-Gramm-Baucus-Warner \nAmendment during the Senate debate of TEA-21 in 1998. That effort \nresulted in some $26 billion in funding being added to that bill and \nput us on a path to historic funding increases for our nation's highway \ninfrastructure. I look forward again to working with my fellow Senators \non completion of a bill that makes the necessary investments in our \nnation's highways, not just in the Appalachian Region, but across our \nentire country.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself and Mr. Kohl):\n  S. 1177. A bill to ensure the collection of all cigarette taxes, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today, with my colleague Senator \nKohl, to introduce S. 1177, the Prevent All Cigarette Trafficking, PACT \nAct of 2003. I do so because of my concern that contraband cigarettes \ncontribute heavily to the profits of organized crime syndicates, \nspecifically global terrorist organizations. Furthermore, illegal \ncigarette trafficking has had a damaging impact on the economies of \nnumerous States.\n  Organized crime syndicates typically purchase cigarettes in States \nwith low taxes and transport the product into states wit high taxes to \nillegally sell to small retailers below market costs. The Internet has \nexacerbated this problem. Frequently, these syndicates produce \ncounterfeit State and city tax stamps in order to make it less risky \nfor these small retailers to sell them to consumers. For example, \nVirginia has a per pack tax of 2.5 cents, while New York City has a per \npack tax of $3. Organized crime syndicates, such as those affiliated \nwith the Lebanon-based terrorist organization, Hezbollah, have been \nknown to purchase and transport cigarettes in tractor-trailers up \nInterstate 95 from Virginia to New York for resale. As one can easily \nsee, a State such as New York is losing millions of dollars in revenue \neach year because of unpaid taxes on these contraband cigarettes, while \nterrorist organizations are making millions in profits.\n  Recent articles in the Washington Post and New York Post revealed \nthat a cigarette-smuggling ring, which allegedly purchased over 70,000 \ncartons from undercover Federal agents in a sting operation last fall, \ndoes in fact have ties to Hezbollah. If this group had been successful \nin its racketeering scheme, it would have amounted to a loss of nearly \n$2.4 million in tax revenue for New York and millions in profits for \nHezbollah, allowing this organization to finance their terrorist \nactivities.\n  Members of an organized crime syndicate arrested in Charlotte, NC \nlast year for smuggling contraband cigarettes from North Carolina to \nMichigan were also using their illegal profits to aid Hezbollah, \naccording to the Charlotte Observer. The Buffalo News reported that one \nof the members of the Charlotte syndicate, Mohamad Hammoud, allegedly \nhas ties to a recently arrested Detroit-area syndicate, which includes \ntwo women from the Seneca Nation of Indians' Cattaraugus reservation. \nBecause the syndicate transported the cigarettes from North Carolina to \nMichigan for resale, Michigan lost $12.50 per carton in sales and \nexcise taxes. These examples illustrate that cigarette smuggling is not \nonly a lucrative business for organized crime but also detrimental to \nthe budgets of many states.\n  The PACT Act attacks the problem of illegal cigarette trafficking by \nthese organized crime syndicates through its strengthening of the \nJenkins Act of 1949, 15 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 375-378, 2003. In its current \nform, the Jenkins Act requires tobacco vendors to register with each \nState tax administrator in which they sell cigarettes, as well as file \na monthly report that provides shipment information within each State. \nFailure to do so is a misdemeanor. Compliance with this statute enables \nStates to collect cigarette excise, sales and use taxes from consumers. \nThis legislation, which the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin and I \nare introducing, strengthens the Act by increasing the reporting \nrequirements first established under Jenkins, expressly including \ncigarette orders placed through the Internet, lowering the threshold \nfor cigarettes to be treated as contraband from 60,000 to 10,000, \nincreasing the criminal penalty for violating the Act to a felony and \ncreating a substantial civil penalty.\n  The PACT Act will also provide State attorneys general with the \noption to bring actions in federal court, which is a tool desired by \nmany states. According to a GAO report from last year on Internet \ncigarette sales, online cigarette sellers simply do not comply with the \nJenkins Act requirements--in fact most of them defiantly state that \nthey do not comply with the Jenkins Act. Many State attorneys general \nrealize that this practice is unfair not only to their individual \nStates, but also to the brick and mortar retailers located in their \nstate, placing these businesses at an unfair commercial disadvantage. \nProviding these state attorneys general with the ability to bring \nactions against these out-of-state Internet vendors for lost revenue is \ncrucial in leveling the playing field and collecting the rightful \nrevenue for states like Washington, California, New York, Wisconsin, \nMichigan and Rhode Island.\n  I ask my colleagues to join Senator Kohl and me in our efforts to \nhelp stop the funding of global terrorist organizations and ensure that \nStates are able\n\n[[Page S7258]]\n\nto recover lost revenue by co-sponsoring and supporting the PACT Act of \n2003.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/03/senate-section/article/S7258-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7258]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 158--COMMENDING THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA CAVALIERS \nMEN'S LACROSSE TEAM FOR WINNING THE 2003 NCAA DIVISION I MEN'S LACROSSE \n                              CHAMPIONSHIP\n\n  Mr. ALLEN (for himself, and Mr. Warner) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

Whatever the two leaders work out, \nwe are happy to work on this.\n  The energy bill, as it is now before the Senate, is a revenue \nmeasure. We understand the importance of moving the energy bill. We \nwant to cooperate in any way we can.\n  However, we do understand the importance of this matter that was not \ntaken care of in the tax bill that involves 12 million children in \nAmerica.
