Under the order, we \nwill resume debate on the Kennedy amendment relating to the earth \npenetrator. There will be 50 minutes of debate per side prior to the \nvote in relation to that amendment.

I anticipated that we would have \nvotes today throughout the afternoon on some of the pending amendments. \nI have also previously mentioned the need to set votes on some of the \npending judicial nominations. We expect to set three of those judicial \nnominations for votes late this afternoon, and we will alert Senators \nas to the precise time when the agreement is locked in.\n  As I have stated previously, it will be helpful if we can vote on \nsome of these noncontroversial nominations by voice vote and not \nconsume valuable Senate time with rollcall votes that result in \nunanimous confirmations. I will reiterate the importance of finishing \nthe Defense bill this week. We have a number of scheduling requests, \nand we are doing our very best to work around those specific requests. \nHowever, Members should be prepared for busy days and evenings, if \nnecessary, to finish this important defense legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/15/senate-section/article/S6749-6", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6749-S6751]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNITION OF THE DEMOCRATIC LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will use my leader time to make a \nrelatively brief statement.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Democratic leader is recognized for \nthat purpose.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, over the past 4 years, our nation has \ngained a renewed awareness of the bravery and sacrifice of America's \nservice men and women.\n  And through the exceptional valor they have routinely displayed, \nAmerica has also gained a renewed sense of gratitude for the service of \nour veterans.\n  So it was with a heightened sense of respect and appreciation that \nAmerica commemorated the recent anniversary of D-Day and Memorial Day, \nand dedicated the long-overdue memorial to the generation that fought \nand won World War II.\n  The veterans who came to Washington expecting to find one tribute \ncast in stone, encountered many living tributes, just as meaningful, \nand just as enduring.\n  Americans of all ages, of all backgrounds, said ``thank you'' to the \nveterans who fought for them. Some gave gifts of American flags. Others \nasked for pictures.\n  I recently heard a story about two World War II veterans who were \neating dinner at a restaurant, when a young man they had never met \nthanked them, and struck up a conversation.\n  He asked about their service, and told them that two of his relatives \ndidn't make it home from Europe.\n  When it came time for the two older men to pay the tab, they found \nthat the young man had already paid it. He left a card that said, ``To \ntwo old guys who paid the price, but who are not going to pay today.''\n  The memory of our veterans' achievements will live on long after \nthem, and all Americans should feel proud that, in this way, we have \nkept faith with our veterans.\n  But a shadow is cast over the tributes now paid to our veterans, and \nindeed, to our soldiers fighting in uniform today.\n  There seems to be a gap between the thanks America offers its \nveterans in word, and the thanks our government shows veterans in deed.\n\n[[Page S6750]]\n\n  The waits at the VA hospital are too long.\n  Veterans are paying record amounts out-of-pocket for VA health \nservices.\n  In recent days, we have learned that the White House is planning new \ncuts for FY06, even as the VA faces an influx of war veterans from \nIraq.\n  This year, as in every election year, Americans will ask themselves, \nam I better off than I was four years ago? Am I safer? Am I more \nfinancially secure? Do I have better access to prescription drugs and \nhealth care than before?\n  In the coming months, America's 26 million veterans will be asking \nthemselves those same questions. All America would do well to listen to \ntheir answers.\n  Recently, I heard from a South Dakotan named Howard Anderson.\n  Howard is 77 years old, a veteran of World War II. Howard is grateful \nto the doctors and nurses at the VA, but feels squeezed by the rising \ncost of prescription drugs.\n  On average, he pays around $90 per month for medicine to treat his \nlung condition.\n  The VA won't pay for his medications because he makes too much money \neven though he and his wife live on their Social Security. ``At the end \nof the month,'' he said, ``I couldn't write you a check for a dollar.''\n  Not long ago, the VA sent Howard a letter notifying him that he owed \nanother $300 for prescriptions.\n  After the shock wore off, Howard went back through his receipts and \nfound he was being double-charged.\n  It had happened before, but he didn't have the patience to battle \nthrough the bureaucracy to make it right again, so he just paid the \nbill. This time, he just couldn't afford it.\n  The VA ultimately admitted it was making a mistake. But Howard is \nbeginning to get the sense that tight budgets have forced the VA to \nbecome more aggressive about denying care or sending the bill to the \nveteran.\n  ``They say these benefits are there for you,'' he says, ``but when \nyou go to get them, they don't give them to you.''\n  Let me say that the problems with the VA health system are not the \nfault of the doctors and nurses and the other men and women who work at \nVA hospitals and clinics.\n  They are among the most talented, most dedicated health professionals \nin this country. But they can only do so much with the resources they \nare given.\n  And from the first days of this Administration, the White House has \nsystematically tried to reduce veterans benefits, cut funding to the \nVA, and shortchange the health care of America's veterans.\n  Over the past four years, the budget for veterans' health has risen \nfar less than the rate of health care inflation, forcing VA hospitals \nto meet rising demand with shrinking resources.\n  The White House's 2005 budget deepens this trend by including only a \n1.9 percent funding increase, barely one-sixth of the rate at which \nhealth care costs are increasing nationwide.\n  Overall, the White House budget falls over $4.1 billion short of \nveterans' needs, according to the Independent Budget created by leading \nnonpartisan veterans groups.\n  Not only would the White House's budget strain VA hospital budgets to \nthe breaking point, it would drive nearly 800,000 veterans out of the \nVA health system.\n  Eight-hundred thousand Americans who were promised health care in \nexchange for their service to their country will be denied and kicked \noff the rolls for no reason other than the Administration's refusal to \nadequately fund veterans' health.\n  This would be on top of a recent decision by President Bush to deny \nour obligations to 200,000 Priority 8 veterans and keep them from \nenrolling in the VA health care system.\n  Those veterans who remain in the system have been forced to pay more, \nmuch more. Over the course of the last three years, the amount veterans \nhave paid toward their own care has increased a staggering 340 percent, \nor $561 million.\n  And if the White House gets its way, veterans would need to pick up \nover a half-billion dollars more of their care in 2005, if the budget \nproposals as we have now witnessed them go through.\n  Some within this administration seem to believe that our \nresponsibility to our soldiers is when they come home, but we couldn't \ndisagree more.\n  If it were not for the efforts of many in Congress, the story would \nbe much worse. Since President Bush took office, we have led the charge \nto add a total of almost $2 billion in funding for veterans health care \nbeyond what the President proposed.\n  Moreover, in each of the last 3 years, Democrats have blocked Bush \nadministration attempts to increase copayments and enrollment fees even \nhigher. Is this the same President who ran for election with a pledge \nto veterans that ``help is on the way''?\n  In the next few days, some of us will offer an amendment to make a \nsimple promise to our veterans: If you wore the uniform of our Nation, \nif you fought under our flag, your health care needs will be met for \nlife. The full funding of veterans health care would be made mandatory \nunder the law.\n  For too long, the VA budget has been subject to the give-and-take of \nbudget politics. It is time we set things straight.\n  Funding for the VA should no longer be set by political convenience, \nback-room deals, or zero sum game of budget politics. One thing, and \none thing alone, should govern the care of our veterans: the needs of \ncare for those veterans.\n  Senate Democrats have also been fighting, and we will continue to \nfight, for full concurrent receipt of all disabled veterans under the \nremarkable leadership of my colleague, the distinguished assistant \nDemocratic leader from Nevada.\n  The Bush administration has repeatedly threatened to veto concurrent \nreceipt, and last year the White House called together leading veterans \norganizations to propose a compromise: We will give you full concurrent \nreceipt but only if you agree to end disability benefits for two-thirds \nof all veterans.\n  Veterans organizations and their allies in Congress rejected the \ninadequate proposal. Instead, thanks in large part to Senator Reid, \nDemocrats were able to pass a provision to allow veterans rated 50-\npercent disabled or more to receive full concurrent receipt.\n  We have made progress on concurrent receipt since the last election, \nbut it has been in spite of the administration, not because of it. What \nwe have achieved so far is just a downpayment on what disabled veterans \nhave been promised and what they deserve. How could we do otherwise? \nHow could we let our country move forward and leave behind the men and \nwomen whose bravery has won our freedom and prosperity?\n  The debt we owe our veterans is unending. But just because we could \nnever hope to repay fully our obligations to our veterans does not \nexcuse us from trying. Today we are further away from doing right by \nour veterans than ever before.\n  America's veterans are not better off than they were 4 years ago. \nWhen he signed the GI Bill of Rights in 1944, President Roosevelt noted \nthat ``the members of our Armed Forces have been compelled to make \ngreater . . . sacrifices than the rest of us, and they are entitled to \ndefinite action to take care of their special problems.''\n  The current White House has allowed ``definite action'' to give way \nto little more than indefinite praise. Veterans deserve better. The \nsoldiers fighting this very day, at this very moment, deserve better.\n  I think back to that young man 2 weeks ago who looked upon two men to \nwhom he owed his freedom and way of life, and he knew enough to say \nthank you.\n  Then I think of Howard Anderson who did pay the price but is being \ndenied help by the Government because it refuses to fully fund veterans \nhealth. Howard Anderson and all veterans are owed a debt.\n  We should acknowledge that debt every day, not just in stone \nmonuments or in lofty speeches or bright parades. It should be repaid \nin a real and concrete commitment to care for veterans in the days when \nveterans need it the most.\n  These men and women risked their lives to defend our own. They stood \nup for us, and now we must stand up for them, not just with words but \nwith action.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S6751]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/15/senate-section/article/S6749-6", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6749-S6751]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNITION OF THE DEMOCRATIC LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

On our side, the Senator from Michigan, our ranking \nmember, has been allocated 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan is allocated 10 \nminutes; the Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 12 minutes.\n  We face many different issues in foreign policy, national defense, \nand the war on terrorism. But one issue is crystal clear: America \nshould not launch a new nuclear arms race.\n  We want our children and grandchildren to live in a world that is \nless dangerous, not more dangerous--with fewer nuclear weapons, not \nmore. But that is not the course that the Bush administration is \ntaking. Even as we try to persuade North Korea to pull back from the \nbrink--even as we try to persuade Iran to end its nuclear weapons \nprogram--even as we urge the nations of the former Soviet Union to \nsecure their nuclear materials and arsenals from terrorists--the Bush \nadministration now wants to escalate the nuclear threat by developing \ntwo new kinds of nuclear weapons for the United States--mini-nukes that \ncan be used more easily on the battlefield, and bunker busters to \nattack sites buried deeply underground.\n  As President Reagan would say, ``There you go again''--another major \nblunder in foreign policy. Our goal is to prevent nuclear \nproliferation. How does it help for us to start developing a new \ngeneration of nuclear weapons?\n  It's a shameful double standard. As Mohammed El Baradei, the director \nof the International Atomic Energy Agency, said in an address to the \nCouncil of Foreign Relations in New York City said last month, ``there \nare some who have continued to dangle a cigarette from their mouth and \ntell everybody else not to smoke.''\n\n  The specter of nuclear war looms even larger with the ominous \nstatements of senior officials in the Bush administration that they in \nfact consider these new weapons more ``usable.'' If the Bush \nadministration has its way, the next war could very well be a nuclear \nwar, started by a nuclear first strike by the United States.\n  It is hard to imagine a dumber idea. The amendment that the Senator \nfrom California and I are offering will put a halt to the Bush \nadministration's plan to develop these new nuclear weapons. Just as \n``lite'' cigarettes still cause deadly cancer, lower yield nuclear \nweapons will still cause massive death and destruction. No matter what \nyou call them, a nuclear weapon is a nuclear weapon.\n  They still incinerate everything in their path. They still kill and \ninjure hundreds of thousands of people. They still scatter dangerous \nfallout over hundreds of miles. They still leave vast areas that are \nradioactive and uninhabitable for years to come.\n  There are few more vivid examples of the misguided priorities of the \nBush administration. For the past 15 months, our troops in Iraq have \nbeen under fire every day. They were sent into battle without the \nlatest and best bulletproof vests and without armored Humvees. They \nwere placed at greater risk, denied the basic equipment they needed to \nprotect themselves and do their jobs. Meanwhile, the Bush \nadministration is urging Congress to provide hundreds of millions of \ndollars for new nuclear weapons.\n\n  The mini-nuke has a yield of five kilotons or less. That's still half \nthe size of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima that killed more than \n100,000 people--at least a third of the city's population. Is it \nsomehow more acceptable to produce a modern nuclear bomb that kills \nonly tens of thousands instead of a hundred thousand?\n  The Bush administration also has extensive plans to develop the \n``bunker buster,'' or, as the administration calls it, the Robust \nNuclear Earth Penetrator. It would carry a nuclear warhead of around \n100 kilotons--ten times the size of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima. It \nwould be placed in a hardened cone capable of burrowing deep \nunderground before exploding.\n  Even with today's advanced technology, they would still spew \nthousands of tons of radioactive ash into the atmosphere.\n  There are more effective ways to disable underground bunkers. Using \ntoday's highly accurate conventional weapons, we can destroy the intake \nvalves for air and water. We can knock out their electricity. And we \ncan destroy the entrances, preventing people and supplies from going in \nor getting out.\n  In fact, by rushing to develop these weapons, the Bush administration \nmisses the point. The challenge of destroying deep underground bunkers \nis not solved with nuclear weapons. It will be solved by developing \nmissile cones that can penetrate deeper into the earth without being \ndestroyed on impact.\n  The bill before us authorizes a study of these two new nuclear \nweapons systems. It provides $9 million for the development of advanced \nconcepts for nuclear weapons, the so-called ``mini-nukes,'' and more \nthan $27 million for the robust nuclear earth penetrator, the so-called \nbunker busters.\n  Those who support the development of these weapons suggest that it is \nonly research and that the research will have little effect on the rest \nof the world. The supporters of these weapons argue that since the \nfunds are limited to research, the administration will not go on to \nproduce these weapons without congressional approval. That is what \nSecretary Rumsfeld claimed when he testified before the House \nAppropriations Committee in February. He said that what has been \nproposed is some funds be used to study and determine the extent to \nwhich a deep earth penetrator conceivably could be developed, what it \nwould look like, and whether it makes sense to do it. There are no \nfunds in here to do it. There are no funds in here to deploy it since \nit does not exist.\n  The administration's own budget contradicts that statement. Its \nbudget assumes we will spend $485 million on\n\n[[Page S6752]]\n\nthese weapons over the next 5 years. It has a detailed plan for their \ndevelopment and production. I have in my hand their projection by the \nCongressional Budget Office of the development of this program for some \n$485 million from now through 2009, and it anticipates the completion \nof the development phase in fiscal year 2007. We can see it right in \ntheir proposals. Then it has the continued development of the program \nitself.\n  This is the clear indication of what the administration is intending. \nIt is in their budget. It is $485 million, and it is right there just \nwith regard to the bunker buster just as it is with regard to the nuke. \nWe will see that it goes on through fiscal year 2009 as well. So if we \ndo not adopt this amendment, we can be confident that the \nadministration will build them. After that, as the administration's own \nnuclear experts have said, they will ultimately deploy them and use \nthem.\n  In fact, in our debate 2 weeks ago, my colleague from Arizona \ndescribed a situation in which he believed they should be used. He \nclaimed conventional bunker busters were incapable of knocking out \nSaddam Hussein in those early days of the war and that only nuclear \nweapons could have destroyed his deeply buried hardened bunkers.\n  If that is the plan for these weapons, then the prospect is even more \nfrightening for our troops, for America, and for the world. Is the \nSenator from Arizona truly suggesting we should have used a nuclear \nweapon to hit Saddam Hussein's bunkers last May? Baghdad is a city of \nover 5 million Iraqis. We would have killed hundreds of thousands of \npeople, including American aid workers and journalists. We would have \nturned the entire area into a radioactive wasteland. And all to capture \nthe person we captured with conventional means a few months later?\n  Using a nuclear weapon to strike Saddam Hussein would have inflamed \nthe hatred of America in Iraq and the Arab world far beyond anything we \nhave seen in response to the prison scandal at Abu Ghraib. It would \nhave poisoned our relations with the rest of the world and turned us \ninto an international pariah for generations to come.\n  The President told us this winter that there is a consensus among \nnations that proliferation cannot be tolerated. He added that this \nconsensus means little unless it is translated into action. But the \nadministration's idea of action is preposterous. It only encourages a \ndangerous new arms race and promotes proliferation. By building new \nnuclear weapons, the President would be rekindling the nuclear arms \nrace that should have ended with the end of the cold war.\n\n  He has given inadequate support to nonproliferation efforts with \nRussia. With the Moscow treaty, the deep cuts in our nuclear arsenals \nwould not be permanent since we could keep a large number of such \nweapons in storage, capable of being activated and used in the future.\n  In January 2002, the Pentagon released a document called the Nuclear \nPosture Review, and despite subsequent efforts to downplay its \nsignificance, its tone of recommendations revealed the dangerous new \ndirection in our nuclear policy. The double standard is clear. The rest \nof the world must abandon the development of nuclear weapons, but the \nUnited States can continue to build new weapons.\n  As is pointed out in the Nuclear Posture Review, it talks about the \nsecond principal finding is the United States requires a much smaller \nnuclear arsenal under the present circumstances, but first the nuclear \nweapons are playing a smaller role in U.S. security than at any other \ntime in the nuclear age. Then it goes on to talk about the alternatives \nthat are being developed with the smaller nuclear weapons.\n  The Bush administration thinks the United States can move the world \nin one direction while we move in another; that we can continue to \nprevail on other countries not to develop nuclear weapons while we \ndevelop new tactical applications for these weapons and possibly resume \nnuclear testing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 2 additional minutes.\n  The decision the administration has made on nuclear posture reverses \n50 years of bipartisan commitment to arms control. Over the past 50 \nyears, we have halted and reversed the nuclear arms race, and now we \nare starting to escalate it again. It makes no sense to undermine half \na century of progress on nuclear arms control and start going backward. \nAnd all for what? To deal with emerging threats we can already handle \nwith conventional weapons.\n  Even the House Republicans have acknowledged the flaw in the \nadministration's plan. Chairman Hobson eliminated all funding for these \nmini-nukes and bunker busters, saying that the National Nuclear \nSecurity Administration needs to take a time out on new initiatives \nuntil it completes a review of its weapons complex in relation to \nsecurity needs and budget constraints, and the administration's own new \nplan to eliminate half of our stockpiled warheads. That is the \nconclusion of the House of Representatives after extensive hearings.\n  The Bush administration is asking Congress to buy something that we \ndo not need and we will never use, that makes our goals for a peaceful \nworld much more difficult to achieve, and that endangers us by its mere \nexistence.\n  Over the period of this last half century, Democrats and Republicans \nhave pursued sensible arms control, engaged the world in nearly a \nglobal commitment to nonproliferation, and demonstrated the will of the \nUnited States to pursue counterproliferation when diplomacy failed to \nstop illicit flows of weapons of mass destruction.\n  President Kennedy started the process that would lead to the \nnonproliferation treaty, but he could not finish it. President Johnson \npicked up where he left off and signed it, but he did not have time to \nratify it before his term ended. President Nixon ratified it. \nPresidents Ford, Carter, and Reagan negotiated SALT and START. \nPresident Bush signed START I and START II. President Clinton signed \nSTART III and led America through the massive post-cold-war reduction \nin its nuclear arsenal. That is the record: Democrat and Republican \nalike moving us away from nuclear escalation, and that is what this \namendment will continue.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I rise today in opposition to the Kennedy-Feinstein \namendment that would strip the authorization for funding for the robust \nnuclear earth penetrator and the advanced concepts. Again, we have \nheard the argument of how somehow or another we would have further \nworld peace if we just weakened America, and I could not disagree more \nwith that.\n  I believe we do have peace through strength, and what we have in this \nparticular legislation is a study to study where the strengths are of \nour adversaries and where the proper response to those strengths would \nbe. I do not think anybody has any preconceived notion of how this \nstudy should come out; we just think we need to know some vital \ninformation to make sure America remains strong.\n  I am disappointed once again by the efforts of those on the other \nside of the aisle to eliminate altogether this administration's effort \nto study options for modernizing our nuclear deterrent. To me, it seems \nthat sponsors of this amendment may not fully understand how important \nit is for the United States to maintain a credible deterrent, or how a \nmodernized deterrent could result in a substantial reduction in our \nnuclear stockpile.\n  Over the last several years, the Department of Defense closely \nexamined our nuclear weapons posture. It became apparent that the cold-\nwar paradigm of mutually assured destruction was no longer an \nappropriate response for the United States. Increasingly, irrational \nrogue nations and nonstate actors have emerged as a greater threat to \nU.S. security than historical adversaries. As part of this examination, \nit was discovered that many of our adversaries are building \nincreasingly hardened and more deeply buried facilities in order to \nprotect high-value targets such as command and control nodes, ballistic \nmissiles, and, in some cases, the actual development of facilities for \nweapons of mass destruction.\n  Many of these buried targets are immune to our conventional weapons. \nTherefore, our ability to deter such undesired activities is greatly \neroded.\n\n[[Page S6753]]\n\n  The need to hold these targets at risk became so apparent that in \n1994 U.S. Strategic Command and Air Combat Command issued a mission \nneeds statement for a capability to defeat hardened and deeply buried \ntargets.\n  In 1997, the Department conducted an analysis of alternatives to \naddress intelligence and strike capabilities related to defeating \nhardened and deeply buried targets. To almost everyone's surprise, the \nanalysis of alternatives found that not all hardened and deeply buried \ntargets could be defeated by current or conceptual conventional \nweapons.\n  Then, in 1999, the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chief of Staff \nrequested that a capstone requirements document for hardened and deeply \nburied targets be developed. Again, this document provided additional \njustification for a requirement for both conventional and nuclear \nweapons capable of defeating these targets.\n  Meanwhile, during these military studies and analyses, the Clinton \nadministration was already building and deploying an interim nuclear \nearth penetrator.\n  I have noticed that the advocates of the Kennedy-Feinstein amendment \nhave tried to place the blame on the Bush administration. But here we \nare--the Clinton administration building and deploying an interim \nnuclear earth penetrator. Even he recognized the need and the changing \nenvironment in which we must act in order to maintain a strong America.\n  The modified nuclear weapon was designated the B61-11 and entered \nservice in April 1997. While this weapon provided a limited capability, \nit does not have capability to defeat all types of hard and deeply \nburied targets.\n  With this history in mind, it surprises me that once again we are \nhere to debate whether we should go forward with a feasibility study on \na modified nuclear weapon and whether our scientists can explore \nnuclear weapon concepts.\n  Let me take a moment to respond to clear up some misconceptions that \nhave been suggested by the supporters of Kennedy amendment.\n  First, opponents of RNEP argue that conventionally armed ``bunker \nbuster'' weapons are sufficiently effective to destroy hardened and \ndeeply buried targets. Clearly, advanced conventional earth penetrators \nare the weapon of choice for most hardened and deeply buried \nfacilities, but according to the Department of Defense, they are not \neffective against a growing class of hardened and deeply buried \ntargets. Moreover, the precise location of surface support facilities \nare not always known, and at best, we can only hope to disrupt the \noperation of a hardened or deeply buried target for a few hours or days \nat most.\n  The second argument used by opponents of RNEP is that any \nmodifications to the U.S. nuclear weapons arsenal will encourage other \nnations to develop new nuclear weapons. This argument suggests that \nthere is a direct correlation between our activities and those of other \nnations. I could not disagree more with this notion.\n  Over the last 10 years, we have conducted very little work on new \nnuclear weapons. Yet Pakistan and India have conducted nuclear tests. \nRussia and China continue to develop nuclear weapons. And, countries \nsuch as Iran and North Korea are secretly working to build new nuclear \nweapons. All of this activity has taken place without the U.S. taking \nany action with regard to our nuclear stockpile.\n  In response to our mini-nukes, first, ``battlefield nuclear weapons'' \nwould be tactical, not strategic. Second, President George H.W. Bush's \nPresidential Nuclear Initiative, announced September 27, 1991, did away \nwith all U.S. battlefield nuclear weapons. In fact the Pantex plant in \nAmarillo, TX, dismantled the last battlefield nuclear weapon, the W-79 \nartillery shell in 2003. The administration has no plans to change that \ndecision. Nor are there plans by the Department of Defense or \nDepartment of Energy to research or develop ``battlefield nuclear \nweapons.'' The administration believes that nuclear weapons are \nstrategic weapons of last resort.\n  In fact, if the United States does not show that it is serious about \nensuring the viability of our entire military capability, including our \nweapons of last resort, we might not be able to dissuade potential \nadversaries from developing weapons of mass destruction and deter those \nadversaries from using those weapons they already have.\n  The third argument used by opponents of RNEP is that the \nadministration has already decided to develop, build, and test a new \nrobust nuclear earth penetrator. They point to a Congressional Research \nService report that seems to suggest that the RNEP is not merely a \nstudy because the budget projections over the next 5 years are nearly \n$500 million for the program.\n  To be clear, it was Congress that directed the Department of Energy \nto prepare 5-year budget profiles. The nearly $500 million outlined in \nthe latest profile is only a projection of what the costs might be if \nthe results of the feasibility study are reasonable, the administration \nopts to proceed, and the Congress approves the development of such a \nweapon.\n  We must keep in mind that the administration cannot begin the \ndevelopment, much less build or test, a new robust nuclear earth \npenetrator without the expressed approval from Congress. Section 3117 \nof the Fiscal Year 2004 National Defense Authorization bill makes this \nclear. It specifically states that ``the Secretary of Energy may not \ncommence the engineering development phase of the nuclear weapons \ndevelopment process, or any subsequent process, of a Robust Nuclear \nEarth Penetrator weapons unless specifically authorized by Congress.''\n  The fourth argument used by opponents of RNEP, and perhaps the most \negregious, is that the RNEP will lower the nuclear threshold. Crossing \nthe nuclear threshold represents a momentous decision for any \nPresident. A nuclear weapon's size or purpose does not alter the \ngravity of the decision for using a nuclear weapon. No President would \nuse a nuclear weapon unless it was the option of last resort.\n  Therefore, to suggest that simply modernizing a nuclear weapon \nautomatically lowers the rigor and deliberation in deciding to employ \nthat weapon is unfounded.\n  The success of our goal of assuring our allies and dissuading \npotential adversaries is dependent upon a modern, effective nuclear \ndetterent that can counter today's threats. We must keep in mind that \nthe current U.S. stockpile was developed for very different purposes \nthan the threats that exist today. It was developed for a massive \nnuclear exchange with one nation. Today, these weapons are too powerful \nand may result in greater damage than necessary to neutralize a target.\n  Moreover, these weapons continue to age, making it increasingly more \ndifficult to predict their reliability. We depend upon their \nreliability, as do our allies and our troops in the field.\n  We must also recognize that a modernized nuclear stockpile will \nresult in significant reductions in our stockpile. If we have specific \nweapons that can hold certain targets at risk, it will not be necessary \nto have a vast inventory of strategic nuclear warheads. This path \nforward would yield substantial cost savings and, more importantly, \ndemonstrate our country's commitment to reducing nuclear stockpiles \naround the world.\n  For over 50 years, we, as a Congress, and every President have agreed \nthat nuclear weapons are a critical element of our national security \nstrategy. They remain so today. I believe a modernized detterent will \nhelp ensure that our adversaries are deterred tomorrow.\n  Therefore, I will oppose this amendment and urge my colleagues to \noppose it as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, perhaps I do not understand all I should, \nand I certainly do not understand the term ``modernization of nuclear \nweapons.'' We have thousands of nuclear weapons in this world. We \ncontrol thousands of them in this country. Modernization? It appears \nnow in this debate to be a euphemism for building new nuclear weapons, \ndesigner nuclear weapons, usable nuclear weapons, the kinds of weapons \nyou might use, for example, to bust into caves, the ground, bunker \nbusters.\n\n[[Page S6754]]\n\n  That is the purpose of this amendment, to stop this march toward \nproduction of more nuclear weapons. This country ought to be leading in \nexactly the other direction.\n  Let me read from Time magazine in March of 2002.\n       For a few harrowing weeks last fall, a group of U.S. \n     officials believed that the worst nightmare of their lives--\n     something even more horrific than 9/11--was about to come \n     true. In October an intelligence alert went out to a small \n     number of government agencies, including the Energy \n     Department's top-secret Nuclear Emergency Search Team, based \n     in Nevada. The report said that terrorists were thought to \n     have obtained a 10-kiloton nuclear weapon from the Russian \n     arsenal and planned to smuggle it into New York City. The \n     source of the report was a mercurial agent code-named \n     DRAGONFIRE, who intelligence officials believed was of \n     ``undetermined'' reliability. But DRAGONFIRE's claim tracked \n     with a report from a Russian general who believed his forces \n     were missing a 10-kiloton device. Since the mid-'90s, \n     proliferation experts have suspected that several portable \n     nuclear devices might be missing from the Russian stockpile. \n     That made the DRAGONFIRE report alarming. So did this: \n     detonated in lower Manhattan, a 10-kiloton bomb would kill \n     some 100,000 civilians and irradiate 700,000 more, flattening \n     everything in a half-mile diameter. And so counterterrorist \n     investigators went on their highest state of alert.\n       ``It was brutal,'' a U.S. official told TIME. It was also \n     highly classified and closely guarded. Under the aegis of the \n     White House's Counterterrorism Security Group, part of the \n     National Security Council, the suspected nuke was kept secret \n     so as not to panic the people of New York. Senior FBI \n     officials were not in the loop. Former mayor Rudolph Giuliani \n     says he was never told about the threat. In the end, the \n     investigators found nothing and concluded that DRAGONFIRE's \n     information was false. But few of them slept better. They had \n     made a chilling realization: if terrorists did manage to \n     smuggle a nuclear weapon into the city, there was almost \n     nothing anyone could do about it.\n\n  Our experts thought, based on some evidence from some folks in the \nintelligence community, that one nuclear weapon was missing from the \nRussian arsenal and might be detonated in the middle of an American \ncity. Now, there are tens of thousands of nuclear weapons in the world. \nWe think, probably, between 25,000 and 30,000 nuclear weapons. One \nmissing would be devastating. One of them acquired by terrorists would \nbe devastating.\n  Our job is not to come to the Senate these days with the Defense \nauthorization bill and parrot the line of those who are reckless on \nthis entire subject, saying what we really need to do is to build more \nnuclear weapons, to build bunker busters, earth-penetrator weapons, to \ntalk about using them, to talk about testing nuclear weapons. That is \nnot our job. It is not our responsibility.\n  Our responsibility is to move in exactly the opposite direction. It \nis our responsibility to lead the way to stop the spread of nuclear \nweapons, especially to stop the spread of nuclear weapons, No. 1; No. \n2, to safeguard the stockpiles of nuclear weapons that already exist--\nyes, with us, with Russia and elsewhere; and then No. 3, and very \nimportantly, to begin the long march toward the reduction of nuclear \nweapons.\n  It ought to be our responsibility as a world leader to say we are \ngoing to try to do everything we can to see that a nuclear weapon is \nnever again used in conflict and that we begin to reduce the stockpiles \nof nuclear weapons in this world.\n  For months now, as I have heard people in positions of responsibility \ntalk about the potential of designing new lower yield nuclear weapons \nor earth-penetrator nuclear weapons so that we can use them, I have \nshook my head and thought, what on Earth are they thinking about? Our \njob is to provide world leadership to try to find a way to reduce the \nstockpile of nuclear weapons in this world, to safeguard the stockpile \nof weapons that already exist, make sure terrorists never get their \nhands on one, stop the spread of nuclear weapons to other countries and \nto terrorist organizations and begin the march toward the reduction of \nthe stockpile of nuclear weapons.\n  If we begin this process to talk about modernization and testing and \nbuilding new nuclear weapons and building designer nuclear weapons, and \nfinding nuclear weapons that will bust into caves, it will not leave \nthis world a safer place. It will make this world a more dangerous \nplace. It is, in my judgment, a reckless course.\n  I hope with all my might that the amendment being offered today to \nstop this march toward the building of new nuclear weapons and the \ndiscussion about the plausibility of simply using nuclear weapons as \nanother device in conflict, I hope with all my might we stop it dead in \nthe Senate right now.\n  We have a responsibility. That responsibility is world leadership.\n  I mentioned the article in Time magazine. The potential of one 10-\nkiloton nuclear weapon missing from the Russian arsenal acquired by \nterrorists to be detonated in an American city was devastating news to \nan intelligence community that became apoplectic about it, and should \nhave been. That was just one, and there are nearly 30,000 nuclear \nweapons.\n  Our responsibility is to make sure not that we build more, to make \nsure we reduce the stockpile of nuclear weapons and reduce the danger \nof nuclear weapons.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 minutes.\n  As I mentioned before, we have a very proud tradition of moving the \nUnited States away from nuclear confrontation. I mentioned the start of \nthat effort by President Kennedy beginning the process of \nnonproliferation. President Johnson picked up where he left off, \nalthough he did not have sufficient time. But President Nixon ratified \nit. Presidents Ford, Carter, and Reagan negotiated SALT and START. \nPresident Bush signed START and START II and President Clinton START \nIII.\n  What do they know that this President does not know? Why do we have \nRepublicans and Democrats moving away from the brink of nuclear \nescalation? What are we talking about? Five kilotons would cause \n280,000 casualities, 230,000 fatalities. That is what we are talking \nabout with small nuclear weapons.\n  This is not just modernization. The Senator from Colorado knows we \nhave a very active program now being reviewed by scientists to make \nsure we have an adequate deterrent. What is the effect if you dropped a \n5-kiloton nuclear weapon on Damascus: 280,000 casualties, 230,000 \nfatalities.\n  Just before the first gulf war, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, Colin Powell, commissioned a study of the possibility of the use \nof small nuclear weapons on the battlefield. He rejected all of them \nbecause, he said, ``they have no battlefield utility.''\n  If the Senator from Colorado can show us where we had any hearings, \nwhere any of the Joint Chiefs of Staff have testified they want this \nkind of weapon, I am interested. He cannot because we have not had any \nhearings.\n  This is a statement from the Administrator of the National Nuclear \nSecurity Administration in response to a question on April 8, 2003: I \nhave a bias in favor of the lowest usable yield. I have a bias in favor \nof things that might be usable.\n  There it is, a statement from the No. 1 person in the administration.\n  We have in the Record the 5-year program in terms of the development \nof these weapons, $485 million. We have in the Record the costs of the \nsmall nukes, $82 million. Why are we being asked to go ahead and walk \ndown this path where we have Republican and Democrats and the Chair of \nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff saying this is a mistake?\n  What in the world does the Senator from Colorado know that these \nPresidents did not know? Where is the testimony before our Armed \nServices Committee showing these will be usable?\n  I withhold the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, to suggest that somehow or the other this \nparticular President does not want to be a leader in reducing nuclear \nthreats is absurd.\n  I call to the attention of the Members of the Senate the Moscow \nTreaty which was put together at the first of this administration. He \nbrought down some 8,000 warheads to 1,700 to 2,200 active warheads.\n  The result from our potential adversaries is to produce more nuclear \nwarheads. Our adversaries are not necessarily responding to what we do \nin the United States. Take India and Afghanistan. They are more \ninterested in\n\n[[Page S6755]]\n\nhow each other's country is responding to that issue. They are not that \nconcerned about what is happening here. Despite that, they continue to \nbe proliferating. And there is always the potential they could be \nproliferating warheads that could have an impact on us.\n\n  We know our adversaries are building hard bunkers, deeply buried. \nThis particular piece of legislation is not putting in place the \nengineering or development of nuclear warheads. I have just shared that \nlanguage with my colleagues. But what we are looking at is a study. I \nthink it is foolhardy and irresponsible to not even look at the facts, \nto not call for a study to see where we are in relation to the rest of \nthe world. We know other countries, other than just Afghanistan, such \nas North Korea--I don't see a real stepdown as far as Russia and other \ncountries around the world. We know Iran, admittedly, is looking at a \nnuclear weapons program.\n  So this is an important step in making sure that America remains \nsecure. I think it is a responsible step because we are saying that in \norder to maintain peace in this world we need to have a strong America. \nIf we want to have some response to terrorism and that flexible threat \nwe have out there, we have to have a more flexible defense posture. We \nneed to look at alternatives. And, yes, I believe terrorists throughout \nthe world have the potential of being a real threat to this country, \nalthough the main threat that is recognized today is from many of those \ncountries that I cited.\n  But that is why it is important to have a study. I think those people \nin the know--whether they are in the Bush administration or were in the \nClinton administration--agree we need to stay on top of this issue. I \nthink the irresponsibility would be for us to bury our heads in the \nsand and ignore the fact that the world is changing. The fact is, the \nworld is changing, the threat is changing, and for us to deal with \nthose potential threats, we need to look at modernizing our ability to \ndeal with those changing threats. That is what the provision in this \nparticular bill is all about.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the amendment \noffered by Senators Kennedy and Feinstein to prohibit the use of funds \nfor the support of new nuclear weapons development.\n  Passage of this amendment would ensure that the United States will \nnot develop new nuclear weapons while at the same time asking other \nnations to give up their own weapons development programs.\n  Unfortunately, today we live in a world where governments and \nterrorists are seeking to create and acquire weapons of mass \ndestruction. I am deeply concerned that we are not doing enough to stop \nthe potential flow of weapons and weapon materials to terrorist \norganizations. Rather than devoting scarce resources to researching new \nnuclear weapons we should be securing nuclear material already in \nexistence.\n  The administration's plans to develop new weapons and modify old \ntypes of weapons will compromise U.S. security by undermining efforts \nto make worldwide cooperation on nonproliferation of nuclear and other \nweapons of mass destruction, WMD, more effective.\n  The first Bush administration prohibited work on nuclear weapons then \nunder development and halted nuclear testing except for safety and \nreliability, effectively bringing work on new weapons types to a close.\n  In contrast, I believe this administration's nuclear initiatives are \ncreating a new kind of arms race by expanding our weapon development \nprograms.\n  The United States pledged in the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty ``to \npursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to \ncessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear \ndisarmament.'' This is still a worthy objective.\n  However, instead of strengthening nonproliferation efforts, the \nadministration has requested $27.6 million for the Robust Nuclear Earth \nPenetrator, RNEP, for fiscal year 2005. The request would continue a \nstudy to modify an existing weapon to penetrate completely into the \nground before detonating, increasing its ability to destroy buried \ntargets.\n  The RNEP is a bad idea for a number of reasons. First, it is a common \nmisconception that a weapon detonated a few meters underground creates \nless fallout. In fact, a weapon detonated at a shallow depth would \nactually create more fallout than if it were detonated on the surface.\n  Nuclear testing done in the 1960s demonstrated that weapons detonated \ndeep underground can produce large amounts of fallout. In order to \nprevent this during underground testing done at the Nevada Test Site, \ndetonations were required to be at least 600 feet underground, with no \nvertical shaft open to the atmosphere. This scenario cannot happen in a \nbattlefield situation.\n  We do not have the ability to drive a weapon down to the depths that \nwould be required to prevent huge quantities of fallout from occurring, \nand even if we did, the hole created by the weapon would allow the \nfallout to escape to the atmosphere. Even a low-yield RNEP would kill \nlarge numbers of people from both the blast and from the inevitable \nfallout that would follow.\n  The RNEP study was initially projected to cost $45 million--$15 \nmillion a year for fiscal year 2003-2005. It is now projected to cost \n$71 million, which is too much money to research a weapon that in many \nways duplicates what conventional weapons can do already.\n  Additionally, the budget request includes figures through fiscal year \n2009 that total $484.7 million and includes placeholders for both the \ndevelopment-engineering and production-engineering phases. This may \nindicate that the RNEP study is more than just a study and is in fact \nbeing undertaken with the foregone conclusion that the weapon will go \ninto development. This amendment would effectively stop funding for \nthis weapon.\n  The administration argues that these weapons programs are needed to \nincrease deterrence from a new kind of threat. I do not believe these \nweapons will deter other nations or terrorists. If other nations see \nthe U.S. developing new nuclear weapons, they are likely to think that \nthey need new weapons for their security as well.\n  We already know that terrorists are trying to acquire nuclear \nweapons. Director of Central Intelligence, George Tenet, warned the \nArmed Services Committee once again in March of al-Qaida interest in \nchemical, biological, radiological and nuclear, CBRN, weapons.\n  Director Tenet said, ``Acquiring these remains a `religious \nobligation' in Bin Ladin's eyes, and al-Qaida and more than two dozen \nother terrorist groups are pursuing CBRN materials. Over the last year, \nwe've also seen an increase in the threat of more sophisticated CBRN. \nFor this reason, we take very seriously the threat of a CBRN attack.'' \nWe cannot afford this risk.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Kennedy-Feinstein amendment to \nstop funding new nuclear weapons development programs.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I support the amendment offered by Senator \nKennedy and Senator Feinstein to prohibit the use of funds for the \nRobust Nuclear Earth Penetrator and for the development of new nuclear \nweapons concepts.\n  Both the administration's policy of pre-emptive war and the \nsuggestion, reportedly included in the Nuclear Posture Review, that it \nmight use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear countries undercut U.S. \nnon-proliferation pronouncements. And these policies form the context \nin which we must evaluate administration proposals for new nuclear \nweapons research.\n  Moves to make nuclear weapons just another part of the U.S. arsenal \nof usable weapons send a strong and unmistakable message to other \ncountries: the only way to deter the United States is to have nuclear \nweapons of your own.\n  The President's agenda for a new generation of nuclear weapons is \nincluded in the bill before us today, which funds the Robust Nuclear \nEarth Penetrator, the Advanced Concepts Initiative--which could include \nlow-yield nuclear weapons--and the Modern Pit Facility. Funds for the \nRobust Nuclear Earth Penetrator, known as RNEP, or the bunker buster, \nare supposed to cover a ``study'' of turning existing nuclear bombs \ninto earth penetrators. But what a robust study this is. The 5-year \nbudget required by Congress and submitted by the Department of Energy \nfunds the ``study'' at $27.6 million\n\n[[Page S6756]]\n\nin fiscal year 2005, but the 5-year total balloons to $484.7 million.\n  Last year, Congress passed amendments that required congressional \nauthorization before later phases and developmental engineering of RNEP \ncould take place. The price tag suggests that the administration sees \nRNEP as far more than a study; it is clearly looking ahead to the \ndevelopment and fielding of a new nuclear weapon. If so, the \nCongressional Research Service warns that the 5-year cost is far from \nthe total price tag for this program.\n  It is impossible to provide an estimate of total program cost because \nof the difficulty of the task at hand.\n  The current nuclear earth penetrator, the B61-11, can penetrate only \nto 20 feet in dry earth. According to physicist Rob Nelson from \nPrinceton University, even an extremely small bunker buster with a \nyield of one-tenth of a kiloton must penetrate 140 feet underground to \nbe contained. It is hard to imagine the technical feat required to \npenetrate into hardened targets to the depth necessary to prevent \nmassive fallout from a nuclear weapon with the RNEP's yield, which is \nsaid to be far in excess of 5 kilotons. In fact, preventing the spread \nof fallout from an RNEP is impossible--and tens of thousands or \nhundreds of thousands of casualties could result from the nuclear \nfallout from such a weapon.\n  U.S. nuclear tests from the 1960s and 1970s illustrate the point. The \n1962 ``Sedan'' test exploded a 100-kiloton weapon 635 feet underground. \nIt produced a gigantic cloud of fallout and left a crater a quarter \nmile in diameter. To destroy a deeply buried target, an even larger \nweapon would be needed--and an RNEP would be lucky to penetrate more \nthan 50 feet underground. The fallout would be immense.\n  The bill before us also includes $9 million for the Advanced Concept \nInitiative that could lead to the development of new nuclear weapons, \nincluding low-yield nuclear weapons.\n  This program raises further concerns: Will the new weapons require a \nresumption of nuclear testing, leading others to test as well? Will the \nnew weapons erode the current gap between nuclear and conventional \nweapons, which helps to make nuclear war ``unthinkable'' and to deter \nother countries from developing such weapons?\n  The Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator and low-yield nuclear weapons are \nnot like regular nuclear weapons. Regular nuclear weapons are designed \nto deter an adversary; the massive destruction and civilian casualties \nthey cause make nuclear weapons unlike even other weapons of mass \ndestruction, with the possible exception of smallpox. But these nuclear \nweapons are different. They bridge the gap between conventional weapons \nand the city-busting weapons of the cold war. They offer the lure of a \nbetter way to destroy point targets.\n  Supporters of new nuclear weapons argue that they, too, could deter \nan adversary, and that is true. All nuclear weapons have a deterrent \nfunction. But the deterrence benefits that low-yield weapons provide \nare far outweighed by both the risk that they will actually be used and \nthe dangerous signal that they send to other countries--whether \nintentionally or not--that we intend to fight nuclear wars.\n  These nuclear weapons blur the distinction between nuclear and \nconventional war. They begin to make nuclear war more ``thinkable,'' as \nHerman Kahn might have said. But Herman Kahn's book was ``Thinking \nAbout the Unthinkable.'' He understood that nuclear war was \nunthinkable, even as he demanded that we think about how to fight one \nif we had to. Looking at the foreign and defense policies of the \ncurrent administration, I fear that they have failed to understand that \nvital point. They want to make nuclear war ``thinkable.''\n  And that failure of understanding could lead to bigger failures: a \nfailure to understand how to keep other countries from developing \nnuclear weapons; a failure to view nonproliferation as a vital and \nworkable policy objective; and perhaps even a failure to avoid a \nnuclear war, which would do horrible damage to our country.\n  Building bunker busters and low-yield nuclear weapons is not a path \nto non-proliferation. Neither is a program to do R on such weapons, \nwhile Defense Department officials press our scientists to come up with \nreasons to build them.\n  Neither is a program to test those weapons--which would surely be \nnecessary to develop new low-yield weapons; and which would just as \nsurely be the death knell not only of the Comprehensive Test-Ban \nTreaty, but also of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.\n  Consider what the administration has said regarding nuclear weapons: \nThe Nuclear Posture Review of December 2001 spoke of reducing U.S. \nreliance upon nuclear weapons. But it also reportedly listed not only \nRussia and China, but also North Korea, Iraq, Iran, Syria, and Libya as \npotential enemies in a nuclear war.\n  It spoke of possibly needing to develop and test new types of nuclear \nweapons, gave that as a reason for increasing our nuclear test \nreadiness, and said that nuclear weapons might be used to neutralize \nchemical or biological agents. And in the run-up to the Iraq war, the \nadministration proclaimed a doctrine of preemption against any \npotential foe that acquired weapons of mass destruction.\n  Now, if you were a North Korean leader, or an Iranian or Syrian one, \nwhich part of those reports would you act on? The part that reduces \nreliance on nuclear weapons? Or the part that names you as a possible \ntarget for nuclear preemption?\n  So far, we have one positive answer--from Libya, which is giving up \nits WMD program.\n  But from North Korea and Iran, the response is much more disturbing. \nThe Washington Post reported last month that a new National \nIntelligence Estimate would likely conclude that North Korea has \napproximately eight nuclear bombs, instead of two; and that its secret \nuranium enrichment program would be operational by 2007 and produce \nenough weapons-grade uranium for another six bombs per year. Iran was \naccelerating its nuclear weapons program, when disclosures and IAEA \ninspections exposed it and disrupted Iran's efforts. It pursued two \nmeans of uranium enrichment--centrifuges and lasers--and experimented \nwith separating plutonium.\n  Even countries that are our friends and allies worry about--and react \nto--these U.S. policies. Just last week, Brazil's new Ambassador \nreiterated his country's intent to limit the access of the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency to Brazil's uranium enrichment \nplant. One rationale he used was Brazil's unhappiness that the Bush \nadministration would consider using nuclear weapons against non-nuclear \ncountries.\n  How shall we stem the spread of nuclear weapons? For a while, it \nseemed as though the administration's approach would be to declare war \non every adversary that dared to go nuclear. But do we really intend to \ngo to war with North Korea, if the price is the slaughter of hundreds \nof thousands of South Korean civilians? In fact, we appear now to be \nwithdrawing half our ground combat forces from South Korea to send them \nto Iraq; and there are rumors that those forces will not return to \nKorea.\n  Do we intend to go to war with Iran, when we cannot guarantee \nsecurity in Iraq? The list of countries that we accuse of having \nweapons of mass destruction is long. Will we take them all on? And what \ndo we do when Indian officials cite our Iraq war arguments as \njustification for a possible attack on Pakistan that could risk a \nnuclear war? Is this the world we want?\n  Nobody ever said that nonproliferation was easy.\n  I don't have a silver bullet; and I don't expect the President to \nhave one, either. But you have to keep your eye on the ball. When \nconservatives opposed the Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty, they said that \ncountries would build nuclear weapons for their own strategic reasons. \nThat is right.\n  It means that if we want to prevent proliferation, or roll it back, \nwe have to affect those strategic calculations. Nonproliferation policy \ngives us a framework for those efforts.\n  The Nuclear NonProliferation Treaty gives us international support, \nand affects the calculations of countries whose neighbors sign and obey \nthe treaty. The Nuclear Suppliers Group buys more time, by restricting \nexports of nuclear or dual-use materials and equipment. But in the end, \nit still comes down to other countries' strategic calculations.\n  For lasting nonproliferation, we must treat the regional quarrels \nthat\n\n[[Page S6757]]\n\ndrive countries to seek nuclear weapons. We were able to do that with \nArgentina and Brazil. As South Africa moved away from apartheid, we \nwere able to do that there, as well. We are making a real effort to \nhelp India and Pakistan step back from the brink, and we must continue \nthat effort. But we also have to address security concerns in East \nAsia, including North Korea's concerns, if we are to keep that whole \nregion from developing nuclear weapons. And we have to pursue peace in \nthe Middle East.\n  Nor is there really an alternative to working with the international \ncommunity.\n  We don't have the ability to inspect sites in Iran; the International \nAtomic Energy Agency does have that ability. Its inspections have \nrevealed much about the extent of Iran's nuclear program and have made \nit harder for Iran to pursue that program.\n  We cannot close down proliferation traffic all by ourselves. The case \nof North Korea shows how much we need the help of other countries. The \ncooperation of other countries, especially including Russia and China, \nis essential. That is why the Proliferation Security Initiative is so \nimportant, as is our adherence to international law in implementing \nthat initiative.\n  Those are the paths to nonproliferation. They are long and difficult \npaths, and we do not know whether we will succeed. But we can see where \nwe want to go, and we can see how working those issues will help get us \nthere.\n  Building a new generation of nuclear weapons will only take us on the \nopposite path. So I urge my colleagues to support the Kennedy-Feinstein \namendment to prohibit funding for those counterproductive weapons.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss a critical \nnational security amendment that I have cosponsored. I commend the \nleadership of Senator Kennedy and Feinstein and I join them today in \noffering an amendment that will eliminate funds in this year's budget \nfor research and development on nuclear bunker buster. This amendment \nalso deletes funding for the advanced concepts programs--money \nauthorized for research on small nuclear weapons.\n  Mr. President, I am disappointed that this administration has \nrequested these programs for this year's Department of Energy Budget. \nFirst and foremost, the development of these new weapons are not \nneeded; the U.S. already has 6,000 deployed nuclear weapons. But most \nimportantly, a U.S. decision to proceed with a new generation of \nnuclear weapons will undercut international non-proliferation efforts \nand undermine the United States' credibility on global security.\n  We are currently facing a new type of national security challenge; \nour greatest goal is to prevent the nexus of terrorists and weapons of \nmass destruction. As such, it is imperative that this country's defense \nand foreign policy reflect a firm commitment to every aspect of non-\nproliferation and arms control. Destroying and preventing the spread of \ncurrent nuclear warheads remains a critical component of this \ncommitment. So too is preventing the development of new types of \nnuclear weapons and materials, however small they might be and however \nlimited their use.\n  We invaded Iraq to change a regime that we were told posed an \nimminent threat to global security. The administration assured us that \nnot only had Saddam amassed an arsenal of biological and chemical \nweapons, but he was also actively pursuing nuclear weapons as well. We \nhave so far lost 840 American men and women in this effort but have yet \nto uncover traces of WMD programs in Iraq. I find it truly bizarre and \nhypocritical that the administration would plan to build new types of \nnuclear weapons at the same time it pursues military operations abroad \nwith the purported objective of destroying similar materials.\n  In our global war on terror, the last thing we need is more nuclear \nweapons. What we need are more troops on the ground protecting Iraqis \nand providing stability. What we need is better intelligence and law \nenforcement and enhanced efforts to collaborate with our allies on both \npriorities.\n  Instead, the administration has decided that researching and \ndeveloping new types of nuclear weapons is a priority. How we can \ncredibly ask North Korea and Iran to stop their own nuclear programs \nwhile at the same time we develop mini nukes and bunker busters?\n  Let me respond to three points the administration makes in support of \nits dangerous nuclear requests:\n  First, the administration says the Pentagon must study bunker busters \nfor the war on terrorism; only the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator \n(RNEP), it claims, could be used against suspected underground bunkers \ncontaining weapons of mass destruction. They say our amendment will tie \nthe Pentagon's hands in the war on terrorism. This is not true. The \nadministration's scenario in which the new nuclear explosives are used \nagainst suspected underground bunkers containing biological, chemical \nor nuclear weapons is highly improbable. Our intelligence about the \nlocation of WMD materials is not precise enough to destroy it this way. \nJust imagine launching nuclear bunker busters based on weapons \nintelligence as unreliable as that circulating before the Iraq war. \nEven if underground sites were accurately identified, the resulting \nnuclear explosions could spread the blast, radiation, and toxins over \npopulated areas.\n  Moreover, current conventional weapons in our arsenal can destroy \nthese materials. And if we really care about the threat of WMD, then \nthe proposed research money ought to be going to fund better weapons \nintelligence and improved conventional methods for putting these WMD \nsites out of commission, like blocking air intakes and external energy \nsources.\n  Second, administration officials claim that the bunker buster funding \nand the mini nuke funding is just for feasibility studies and research \nand development, not for use. They claim that we are opposing the \nimportant scientific advances involved in researching these weapons.\n  With nuclear weapons, any materials researched and developed must be \ntested. You cannot understand the physics of nuclear weapons without \ntests. Currently, the U.S. is a signatory of the Comprehensive Test Ban \nTreaty, which prohibits testing nuclear weapons. If we test our new \nweapons, even at an early non-useable stage of development, we are \nimmediately breaking this treaty and inviting other countries that are \nsignatories to break this treaty as well.\n  Finally, the proponents of the nuclear funding say that the \nadministration's request only deals with a small amount of money--$9 \nmillion for the mini nukes and around $30 million for the bunker \nbusters. Relative to a Defense Budget for 2005 projected to surpass \n$440 billion dollars, they say that the sum in question--the sum our \namendment will delete--is insignificant.\n  This is also patently wrong. First, the Fiscal Year 2005 budget \ncontains $9 million for mini nukes, which is a 50 percent increase from \nlast year's request. What's more important is not the sum, but the \nintent. The administration has made it clear that it wants this money \nto create---and I quote the Pentagon ``a more useable'' nuclear weapon. \nThis funding, however small, sends a dangerous message to other members \nof the nine country nuclear club that the U.S. is intending to use our \nnuclear arsenal.\n  Second, with the bunker buster, in May 2003, Secretary Rumsfeld said \nthat the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetarato program ``is a study. It is \nnothing more and nothing less.'' This study was planned to cost $15 \nmillion for fiscal years 2003-2005. Yet this year, the Administration \nrequested $27.6 million for the study, and suddenly revealed that it \nplanned to spend $485 million over the next five years. That is not \ninsignificant at all.\n  I just returned from attending a celebration of the 60th anniversary \nof D-Day in Normandy, France. The most important military and political \nlesson learned from the D-Day battles was the necessity of \ninternational cooperation. I believe that this great example of multi-\nlateral cooperation should be remembered and applied to current events, \nin Iraq and elsewhere. The world watched in awe as young, dedicated \nsoldiers from several countries fought side by side on those beaches \nand cliffs that launched the events that would rid the world of \nfascism.\n  Today, the administration's unilateral foreign policy and \nmarginalization\n\n[[Page S6758]]\n\nof the United Nations has fractured this alliance of democracies. Our \nrelations with Europe are tense and our public standing in the world an \nall-time low. I believe that funding nuclear weapons in this year's \nbudget will only provoke further antagonism between the United States \nand our allies.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Kennedy-Feinstein amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I believe I have 10 minutes allocated to \nme.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I very much support the pending amendment \nbecause I believe if this country is going to have any credibility in \nour argument that countries such as Iran should not be allowed to \nobtain nuclear weapons, we ourselves must reduce our own reliance on \nnuclear weapons and not move in the direction of new nuclear weapons.\n  We undermine our position when we put money into a budget which says \nwe are going to start doing and continue research on new types of \nweapons and on advanced concepts for nuclear weapons, when we have been \na party to a treaty called the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which \nsays:\n\n       Each of the Parties to the Treaty--\n\n  That includes us--\n\n     undertakes to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective \n     measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an \n     early date and to nuclear disarmament, and on a treaty of \n     general and complete disarmament under strict and effective \n     international control.\n\n  We have told the Indians, we have told the Pakistanis: Do not move \ndown that nuclear road.\n  We have told the Iranians: We are not going to let you go down that \nnuclear road. We are going to take actions to prevent you from \nacquiring nuclear weapons. This is at the same time this administration \nis moving this country toward additional reliance on nuclear weapons, \nnew types of nuclear weapons, and new uses for nuclear weapons.\n  It is totally inconsistent for us to be moving in the direction we \ntalk about when it comes to other countries but in the direction that \nwe literally live out when we come to our own activity. Too often this \ncountry has been portrayed as saying that the rules that apply to \neverybody else do not apply to us. We have seen too much evidence of \nthat approach recently. It has dramatically weakened our position in \nthis world and strengthened the terrorists' position when we say we are \nnot governed by the same rules by which everybody else is governed. \nThere is a nonproliferation treaty out there, Iran. You are a member of \nthat treaty, and you have to live up to it.\n  Now, of course, Iran can pull out of that treaty. They can withdraw \nfrom that treaty, too, just as we withdrew from the ABM Treaty. But \nthey are a member of that nonproliferation regime now. So we tell them: \nYou have to live up to that regime. We are not going to sit by and \nallow you to get nuclear weapons.\n  That is what we say over here. But over here we put millions of \ndollars into doing research on new types of nuclear weapons and new \nuses for nuclear weapons which already are in the inventory.\n  This is a grave danger to us. We undermine our own security when we \ntalk out of the right side of our mouth when it comes to what other \npeople can do, and out of the left side of our mouth when it comes to \nour own activity.\n  The effort to move toward more usable nuclear weapons is what this \nargument is all about. This is what Administrator Brooks talked about \nin answer to a question by Senator Reed, when he says:\n\n       And I accept Senator Reed's point that . . . I have a bias \n     in favor of things that might be usable.\n\n  Here is the Administrator of the National Nuclear Security \nAdministration talking about that we have to move toward more usable \nnuclear weapons. And why do we need these weapons? We are told because \nthere are underground bunkers that might be the targets, and that those \nbunkers might not be reachable except through nuclear weapons.\n  Can we just imagine having dropped nuclear weapons going after Saddam \nHussein? We had this intelligence that said he was in an underground \nbunker. And that underground bunker, we were told, was something we \ncould hit with a conventional weapon at the time. It was one of, \napparently, 50 airstrikes that we used against the high-value targets \nin Iraq, including Saddam Hussein and his sons.\n  Well, according to the press, there were about 50 of those \nairstrikes. Not one of them was successful. It turns out there \napparently was not even a bunker at the one we were sure Saddam Hussein \nwas in. But if there was a bunker, he was not in it. According to this \nreport in the New York Times of June 13, a Central Intelligence Agency \nofficer reported that Hussein was in that underground bunker at that \nsite. So we went after him. We directed the airstrikes against that \nbunker.\n  But then, after the main part of this war was over, we went and \ninspected where we had struck based on intelligence that there was an \nunderground bunker containing Saddam Hussein. And lo and behold, not \nonly wasn't there Saddam Hussein--we knew that already--but there \nwasn't even a bunker at the location.\n  And the suggestion that we are going to design nuclear weapons to go \nafter bunkers, despite the huge result in terms of human loss when \nnuclear weapons are used, assumes we have intelligence which is so \nreliable that we can, with great certainty, reach a leader who \notherwise would not be reachable with conventional weapons. If anything \nhas been demonstrated recently during this Iraq war, it is that our \nintelligence is not only not particularly accurate but it is wildly \ninaccurate at times.\n  The idea that we project to the world that we are going to design \nnuclear weapons to go after bunkers--nuclear weapons which have yields \nwhich will kill tens of thousands of people if they succeed with their \nlow yield--it seems to me is not only a message which undercuts our \nposition against proliferation and our position in support of the \nnonproliferation treaty but a message which totally weakens us, which \nopens us up to the attacks of the terrorists who would kill us, that \nthe United States lives by one set of rules when it comes to its own \nactivities at the same time it wants to apply another set of rules to \nthe rest of the world.\n  The administration's Defense Science Board, last year, called for a \nstrategic redirection of the stockpile stewardship priorities in favor \nof nuclear weapons that previously had not been provided for and \nsupported.\n\n  The legislative justification for the administration's position on \nthis matter says we should be exploring weapons concepts that could \noffer greater capabilities for precision and earth penetration and \nweapons which are more ``relevant.'' More relevant nuclear weapons is \nwhat this is all about, relevant and usable nuclear weapons. A more \nrelevant stockpile, according to their definition, will have reduced \nefficient yield.\n  But when you look at what the real yield is of these so-called \nreduced weapons, reduced yields, a 1-kiloton nuclear weapon detonated \nat a depth of 25 to 50 feet would eject more than 1 million cubic feet \nof radioactive debris into the air and leave a crater about the size of \nthe World Trade Center. A 100-kiloton weapon that was detonated 635 \nfeet below ground in Nevada formed a crater 320 feet deep and 1,200 \nfeet in diameter. If a target were so deeply buried that a conventional \nweapon could not effectively harm a target, neither could a low-yield \nnuclear weapon. To successfully reach one of those targets would \nrequire a large yield and a large yield cannot be contained.\n  According to Sidney Drell, a noted physicist at Stanford University \nand a member of the NNSA advisory panel, a target buried at 1,000 feet \nwould take a nuclear weapon with a yield greater than 100 kilotons to \ndo any damage.\n  This body is again faced with a decision: Do we want to continue to \nwalk down a road which we are urging and demanding that others not \nwalk? The greatest fight we must wage is against proliferation of \nweapons of mass destruction that could reach the hands of terrorists.\n  The determination to develop new nukes and new uses for nuclear \nweapons undermines that fight. It weakens us in that fight and it makes \nus less secure in the war against terrorism.\n\n[[Page S6759]]\n\n  I strongly urge that the pending amendment be adopted.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, how much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 18 minutes on the Democratic side and \n33 minutes on your side.\n  Mr. INHOFE. When are we scheduled to have our vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At the conclusion of the use or yielding back \nof the time.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I see there are those wanting to be heard on the other \nside. Let me make a couple comments.\n  We are talking as if this is some program that we are putting \ntogether. This is a feasibility study. This is something to determine \nwhat the costs would be, what risks are out there, what the potential \nthreat is that we could be guarding against. We are talking about a \ndefensive system. I have heard all of the arguments.\n  Since we do have some time, I will let them use some of their time, \nand then I would like to respond so we can stay on schedule.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am very happy to join with Senator \nKennedy in support of this amendment. I come at this from a passionate, \nmoral point of view so my arguments are going to reflect that. We have \nbeen hearing for 2 years now that this is just a study. Yet the \nCongressional Research Service has shown in its reports that, in fact, \nit is much more than a study. This is the reopening of the nuclear door \nand the development of a new generation of nuclear weapons.\n  We, the strongest and most technologically proficient military on \nEarth now see fit to reopen that door and begin to study and develop a \nnew generation of nuclear weapons: One, the robust nuclear earth \npenetrator, a 100-kiloton bunker buster, which at present cannot be \ndeveloped to drive deeply enough into the ground to prevent the spewing \nof massive amounts of radioactive debris; two, something called \nadvanced concepts initiative, which is the development of low-yield \nnuclear weapons, under 5 kilotons, to be used as strategic battlefield \nnuclear weapons; and three, the development of a plutonium pit facility \nwith enough capacity to create up to 450 plutonium pits per year, which \nare the trigger devices in a nuclear weapon.\n  I strongly believe that to proceed on this path is folly because by \ndoing so we are encouraging the very nuclear proliferation we are \nseeking to prevent. In other words, we are telling other countries, \ndon't do what we do, do what we say. We are practicing the ultimate \nhypocrisy. And there is now emerging evidence that others are going to \nfollow this course.\n  When I stood on the floor last week, I mentioned the report that \nIndia is beginning the development of battlefield nuclear weapons. You \ncan be sure Pakistan will follow. We also know Brazil is looking at \nthat opportunity as well. In April of this year, Brazil refused to \nallow IAEA, the International Atomic Energy Agency, inspectors to \nexamine a uranium enrichment facility under construction. They insisted \nthat the facility will only produce low-enriched uranium, which is \nlegal under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, so long as it is \nsafeguarded. They also refused to fully cooperate with the IAEA's \ninvestigation into the nuclear black market operated by Pakistani \nscientist A.Q. Kahn.\n  These are all the signs. We saw them in North Korea as well. Brazil \nappears to be rebelling against what it perceives to be a double \nstandard in the global nuclear proliferation regime. It views President \nBush's proposals, which significantly curtail the sharing of \npotentially peaceful nuclear technology, as a radical departure from \nthe standards agreed to under the NPT. I am quoting from a statement \nissued by the former Foreign Minister of Great Britain, Robin Cook, and \nformer Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in a document entitled ``A \nNuclear Nonproliferation Strategy for the 21st Century.'' We know that \nother countries follow the example of the United States. Why are we \ndoing this?\n  There is good news. Last week the House Appropriations Subcommittee \non Energy and Water eliminated all funding for these programs, \neverything--for the pit facility, for the advanced weapons concepts, \nand for the nuclear bunker buster. That was a wise decision. I believe \nthe action of the House is a reflection of the growing bipartisan \nconcerns that I know many of my colleagues share about this \nadministration's nuclear weapons programs. That is why the Senator from \nMassachusetts and I and the Senator from Michigan and others have \noffered our amendment to eliminate funds for programs to develop new \nnuclear weapons capabilities, including the robust nuclear earth \npenetrator.\n  This administration continues to argue that no new weapons production \nis currently planned. But again, the facts belie this statement.\n  Ambassador Linton Brooks, head of the National Nuclear Security \nAdministration, stated in a recent interview that it is important, in \nhis view, to maintain a manufacturing and scientific base so that the \nUnited States can meet the goal of ``being able to design, develop, and \nbegin production of a new warhead within 3 to 4 years of a decision to \nenter engineering development.''\n\n  That is the ball game--the development of a new warhead. It is not \njust a study; it is development.\n  I mentioned the Congressional Research Service report. I was \nstaggered when I saw that it concluded that the administration's long-\nterm budget plans, including $485 million for the robust nuclear earth \npenetrator between 2005 and 2009, casts doubt on the contention that \nthe studies of a new nuclear weapon are, in fact, just studies. Why \nwould the administration be including $485 million in future funds in \nits long-term budget for a robust nuclear earth penetrator if it was \njust a study? The fact is, they would not. The study doesn't cost $485 \nmillion. The answer is that they are planning to go into the \nengineering and the development phases.\n  What I find most troubling with the administration's approach is the \nsuggestion that we can make nuclear weapons more usable.\n  I strongly believe it must be a central tenet of the U.S. national \nsecurity policy to do everything at our disposal to make nuclear \nweapons less desirable, less available, and less likely to be used.\n  According to press reports, the 2001 Nuclear Posture Review cited the \nneed to develop a new generation of nuclear weapons and suggested a \n``new triad'' which blurred the lines between conventional and nuclear \nforces. I keep mentioning that because this paper is often postulated \nas a throwaway--don't pay attention to it--but it is a very important \nstatement of administration policy.\n  As early as 2001, this administration was creating a new triad of \nstrategic forces, and one part of that would be the nuclear triad--in \nother words, the creation of new weapons that could be used along with \nconventional weapons.\n  This document also names seven countries--not all of them possessing \nnuclear weapons--against which we would consider launching a nuclear \nfirst strike.\n  So this new triad, with its emphasis on the offensive capability of \nthese weapons--even in first-strike scenarios--represents a radical and \ndangerous departure from the idea that our strategic nuclear forces are \nprimarily intended for deterrence. This is significant. We have always \nlooked at our nuclear arsenal as a deterrent arsenal. This is now \nchanging to an offensive arsenal. If you think about how the robust \nnuclear earth penetrator would be used, how low-yield nuclear weapons \nwould be used, they would not be used in a defensive posture; they \nwould be used as part of an offensive thrust.\n  A recent report of the Pentagon's Defense Sciences Board argues that \n``nuclear weapons are needed that produce much lower collateral \ndamage,'' precisely so these weapons can be more ``usable'' and \nintegrated into war-fighting plans.\n  Now, the problem in all of this is that there is no such thing as a \n``clean''\n\n[[Page S6760]]\n\nor usable nuclear bomb. A lot of studies have been done.\n  A leader in this effort is Dr. Sidney Drell, a physics professor at \nStanford University. He points out how the effects of a small bomb \nwould be dramatic. A 1-kiloton nuclear weapon detonated 20 to 50 feet \nunderground would dig a crater the size of Ground Zero in New York and \neject 1 million cubic feet of radioactive debris into the air.\n  The depth of penetration of the robust nuclear earth penetrator is \nlimited by the strength of the missile casing. The deepest our current \nearth penetrator can burrow is 20 to 35 feet of dry earth.\n  Casing made of even the strongest material cannot withstand the \nphysical force of burrowing through 100 feet of granite to reach a hard \nor deeply buried target--much less the 800 feet needed to contain the \nnuclear blast.\n  So if a nuclear bunker buster were able to burrow into the earth to \nreach its maximum feasible penetration depth of 35 feet, it would not \nbe able to be deep enough to contain even a bomb with an explosive \nyield of only 0.2 kilotons, let alone a 100-kiloton bomb like the \nrobust nuclear earth penetrator.\n\n  So given the insurmountable physics problems associated with \nburrowing a warhead deep into the earth, destroying a target hidden \nbeneath 1,000 feet into rock will require a nuclear weapon of at least \n100 kilotons. So anything short of 800 feet will not contain a fallout. \nA fireball will break through the surface, scattering enormous amounts \nof radioactive debris--1.5 million tons for a 100-kiloton bomb--into \nthe atmosphere. Is that what we want to be doing as a Nation?\n  The 1962 Sedan nuclear test at the Nevada Test Site illustrates the \nenormous destructive effects of a 100-kiloton nuclear blast detonated \n635 feet below the surface of the Earth--far deeper than any robust \nnuclear earth penetrator can be engineered to go. The radioactive cloud \nit produced continued to rise as debris settled back to Earth, and the \nbase surge of the explosion rolled over the desert. Even at 635 feet \nbelow the ground, the blast could not be contained.\n  On the floor of the Senate last week, my friend, the distinguished \nSenator from Arizona, Mr. Kyl, argued that because conventional earth-\npenetrating munitions failed to knock out Saddam Hussein in his \nunderground bunker on the eve of the Iraq war, ``only nuclear weapons \ncan address the deeply buried targets that are protected by manmade, or \neven hard geology.''\n  I usually, on security matters, agree with my friend. But consider \nthe implications of this statement. If we had used a nuclear earth \npenetrator, we might have killed Saddam Hussein--that is, assuming we \nhad the right location in the first place, and clearly our intelligence \nwas not right--but at the same time the United States would have used a \nnuclear weapon against a nonnuclear weapon state, detonating it in the \nmiddle of a city of 5 million people. Would leveling Baghdad have been \nthe right way to liberate an oppressed people from a brutal dictator? \nOf course not.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I have one sentence before yielding to the \nSenator from New Mexico. This is a feasibility study. That is all it \nis. You can keep saying over and over that it is more, but it is not. \nIn the 5-year plan, which says in the event the feasibility study \nrecommends it, and in the event the President recommends it, in the \nevent we authorize it in both the House and Senate, then you can go \nforward with it. Right now, it is a feasibility study.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, at the conclusion of the remarks of our \ndistinguished colleague from New Mexico, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe Senator from Virginia be recognized for about 6 or 7 minutes for \nthe purpose of a colloquy with the Senator from Utah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I yield to the Senator from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank Senator Inhofe for the \nopportunity to speak.\n  The Feinstein-Kennedy amendment would prevent the NNSA from studying \nalternative technologies for our nuclear stockpile. It would also \nprevent the NNSA and DOD from studying earth-penetrating capability, \nwhich many military experts believe is an area where our existing \narsenal does not provide sufficient deterrence.\n  The robust nuclear earth penetrator is a study to determine how or if \nthe existing B-61 and existing B-83--those are the names of nuclear \nweapons--might be modified to provide an added capability of \nunderground penetration. At present, our military is unable to provide \ncredible deterrence against deeply buried targets.\n  Included in the President's fiscal year 2005 budget is $27.6 million \nin funding to undertake a feasibility study for the RNEP. With this \nresearch--and I stress research--we may be able to solve the complex \nengineering challenges and identify capabilities for both nuclear and \nconventional weapons to address the evolving tactical challenges. This \nis research not intended to replace any conventional weapon. It would \nonly serve to transition from relying on large megaton city busters \nwith more precise weapons, also providing funding for the NNSA to \nevaluate modification to existing weapons. It does not imply a \ncommitment to build these weapons. Section 3117 of the Defense \nAuthorization Act of 2004 requires that specific congressional \nauthorization be obtained to move beyond a feasibility study. That has \nnot been repealed and has not been changed.\n  Last year, the Energy and Water appropriations bill contained \nlanguage that prevents the NNSA and the Department of Defense from \nmoving beyond a feasibility study without congressional approval. I am \nthe chairman of that committee, and I intend to include similar \nlanguage again this year.\n  The Advanced Concepts Initiative will examine emerging or alternative \ntechnologies that could provide this country with an improved nuclear \ndeterrence.\n  In 2001, the Nuclear Posture Review suggested that we should keep our \nnuclear scientists engaged and thinking about what the nuclear \nstockpile of the future should look like. By denying our scientists the \nopportunity to investigate this technology and the options for our \nstockpile, we will also neglect critical research into improving the \nsafety, reliability, and security of the existing aging stockpile. It \nmakes absolutely no sense to ignore technology and innovation when it \ncomes to nuclear security and deterrence. I guarantee other countries \nare not limiting themselves to what they know today but are focusing on \nnew possibilities for tomorrow.\n  This is not an attempt to build brand-new weapons and add to the \nstockpile. I am very supportive of reducing the number of weapons we \nhave deployed, and I support the President's recently announced efforts \nto take a dramatic step in that direction. I support a much smaller, \nmore flexible stockpile that can respond to a variety of threats in the \npost-cold-war era.\n  Last year, the Appropriations Energy and Water Development \nSubcommittee included a requirement that the President send to Congress \na nuclear stockpile report that underlines the size of the stockpile of \nthe future. This classified report is complete and defines the size and \nmission of our future stockpile. It goes beyond reductions contemplated \nby the Clinton administration. The plan proposed by the President would \nreduce the number of deployed weapons to levels consistent with the \nMoscow Treaty and its lowest level in several decades.\n  But even with these reductions, we must constantly adapt to provide a \ncredible deterrence to the post-cold-war era. It is not realistic to \nthink we can put the nuclear genie back into the bottle. We cannot hope \nthat if we ignore the evolving nuclear threat that it will go away. \nHistory tells us a different story.\n  Despite the U.S. adopting a testing moratorium, several countries, \nincluding France, India, and Pakistan have tested weapons. Countries \nsuch as Libya, Iran, and North Korea have ignored international \npressure to stop the development of a nuclear capability.\n  The fact is, countries will pursue what is in their sovereign best \ninterests, and the U.S. should not believe\n\n[[Page S6761]]\n\nthat we are in any different position. It is in our Nation's best \ninterest to ensure that our weapons serve as a credible deterrent to a \nwide range of threats.\n  I remain hopeful that we will only use our stockpile as a deterrent \nto other nuclear states. However, to be an effective deterrent, it must \nevolve to address the changing threats. We also must maintain a group \nof experts at our national labs that understand the complex science to \nsupport the engineering and physics to ensure our stockpile is a viable \ndeterrent and is safely stored at home.\n  To ensure we have an effective deterrent, we are doing the following:\n  We are maintaining our nuclear deterrent. That sends a clear and \nconvincing signal to our allies and our enemies that our nuclear \ncapability is sufficient to deter most threats.\n  We are maintaining our test readiness that allows us to hedge against \nthe possibility that we may someday need to conduct a test to confirm a \nproblem or verify that we resolved a problem within the stockpile.\n  We are using the RNEP study to examine whether or not existing \nweapons could be adapted to improve our ability to hold at risk deeply \nburied facilities that our enemies occupy.\n  We are challenging our scientists to think of a wide variety of \noptions and face challenges to ensure that our nuclear deterrent is \nflexible and responsive to evolving threats. Failure to challenge our \nphysicists and engineers will limit our capabilities in the future.\n  It is disingenuous of our opponents to argue that these policies put \nus on an irreversible course of new weapons development. Nothing could \nbe further from the truth. Congress has the ultimate responsibility in \ndetermining whether or not to proceed with full-scale development.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this shortsighted amendment that would \nprevent our weapons scientists from investigating the best available \noptions. This research is critical to ensuring this country has an \neffective and safe stockpile that will serve as a credible deterrent to \nall existing and potential threats.\n  I hope that in the process of discussing this issue, we will arrive \nat a conclusion that makes it eminently clear that the statement I have \nmade regarding the 1-year feasibility study will be what we are talking \nabout and what we will adopt.\n  I thank the Senator. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, may I inquire as to the time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 26 minutes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. And the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 3 minutes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Under our unanimous consent agreement, we will recognize \nthe Senator from Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, our distinguished colleague from Utah \nwishes to have a colloquy with me. The colloquy represents a number of \ndays of careful deliberations on a point and issue in last year's bill \nwhich is of great importance to him. I will follow my colleague after \nhe makes his remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I intend to oppose the Kennedy-Feinstein \namendment even though I am sympathetic with many of the arguments they \nmake. I am in agreement with the idea that this is a feasibility study \nonly and that the study should go forward, but my primary concern is \nthat there be no nuclear testing of this particular device or any \naspect of this particular device while the study is going on.\n  It is my understanding that is part of the law accepted previously, \nbut I want to make it absolutely sure. For that purpose, I intend, \nfollowing this vote, some time during the debate, to call up my \namendment which makes it clear that there can be no nuclear testing \nunder the cover of a study of the RNEP as it is so called. That \namendment is offered not only for myself and my colleague from Utah, \nSenator Hatch, but we are joined by Senator Collins of Maine and \nSenator Domenici of New Mexico.\n  I wish to make it clear that my goal is to see to it that there be no \nnuclear testing in the name of the study unless there is a specific \ncongressional vote with respect to that testing. I do not believe it \nwill be necessary, but if some future administration 5, 10, 15 years \nfrom now were to decide they needed to do some nuclear testing, that \nthere was a compelling case to do that, I want that future \nadministration to have to come to the Congress and make the compelling \ncase to the Congress. My amendment goes in that direction with that as \nits goal.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it is my understanding there are others \nwho have associated with the Senator on this matter; am I not correct \nin that?\n  Mr. BENNETT. That is correct. As I said, Senator Hatch, Senator \nCollins, and Senator Domenici have cosponsored the amendment, and there \nare some others who indicated they will as well.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. I think the \nobservations of the Senator from Utah, Mr. Bennett, are important ones. \nI will work with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to see if \nwe cannot accept this amendment eventually because it, in all \nlikelihood, clarifies the language that I put in the bill last year.\n  I think the amendment helps to clarify the intent of the language \nlast year, which in its verbiage requires a specific authorization by \nCongress to proceed with the engineering development phase or \nsubsequent phase of the robust nuclear earth penetrator and, in my \nview, that includes a full-scale underground nuclear test on the robust \nnuclear earth penetrator if such test, in the judgment of the technical \ncommunity, is deemed necessary.\n  So I think the amendment can be helpful, and I will work with my \ndistinguished colleagues on the other side, most specifically the \nranking member, Senator Levin, to see whether we can adopt it.\n  I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for his courtesy and \nlook forward to working with him and Senator Levin to see if we can \nindeed get this amendment adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. At this point, I yield to the junior Senator from Texas \nfor such time as he may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for his \ncourtesy in allowing me to speak briefly against this amendment which, \nas we have heard, prohibits any funding both for a feasibility study on \nthe robust nuclear earth penetrator and for the advanced concepts \ninitiative. My concern is the premise upon which this amendment is \noffered. If the events of the last decade have taught us anything, it \nis that weakness invites aggression by those who see that as an \nopportunity to terrorize or otherwise wreak havoc on innocent civilians \nin this country and elsewhere.\n  The concept that we should somehow prohibit important research--and \nthis amendment would eliminate research because, of course, production \nis prohibited by current law--the suggestion and the logic, if there is \nany, that by somehow blinding ourselves to the threat and the means to \novercome the threats that surround us in an ever dangerous world is \nbeyond me. If we have learned anything in the last decade from the time \nof the bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993 to the bombing of our \nAmerican embassies in Africa to the Khobar Towers incident to the \nbombing of the USS Cole, it is that weakness in the eyes of terrorists \nand rogue nations invites aggression.\n  I wonder from where the sense of moral equivalency comes that we \noften hear in this debate. There are those who have said time and again \nthat if we are to try to reduce the proliferation of nuclear weapons \naround the world, how can America then conduct research on the robust \nnuclear earth penetrator and on those areas covered by the advanced \nconcepts initiative? But I wonder if those who are making these \nstatements truly believe America's research on such weapons systems to \nprotect ourselves and to defend ourselves is somehow the equivalent of \nthe actions of rogue states and terrorists. Moral equivalency is simply \nwrong.\n  There are those who suggest that somehow by conducting essential \nresearch into hardened weapons like the\n\n[[Page S6762]]\n\nrobust earth nuclear penetrator, that may perhaps be able to protect \nour country and assist us in exposing hardened bunkers, which can \ncontain command and control or perhaps even biological or other weapons \nof mass destruction research facilities, that we will start a new arms \nrace. I detect a hint of perhaps the old cold war mentality that \nsomehow they believe we will enter into some sort of arms race which \nwill endanger the world.\n  The truth is, America, as a fraction of its GDP, spends more on \ndefense than the next 20 nations in the world. We are the only \nsuperpower that exists in the world and there is no risk of an arms \nrace such as we saw occur with the former Soviet Union. So this is \nmerely a matter of allowing us to do the basic research into weapons \nthat would allow us to protect ourselves against hardened and deeply \nburied targets where laboratories could store or produce weapons of \nmass destruction. We can conduct research on these weapons as a way to \nprotect ourselves and indeed make America safer.\n  Finally, this amendment would eliminate the advanced concepts \ninitiative. It is important to reiterate what that initiative will do. \nThe initiative focuses on increasing the reliability, safety, and \nsecurity of our existing nuclear weapons stockpile. It focuses on \nassessing the capabilities of our adversaries to ensure we avoid a \ntechnological surprise. It focuses on thinking up innovative methods \nfor countering our adversaries' weapons of mass destruction and \ndeveloping weapons systems requirements, and it focuses on evaluating \nconcepts to meet future military requirements.\n  I fail to see the wisdom of our willingness to blind ourselves to \nemerging threats in a very dangerous world. As I say, our weakness, our \nwillingness to disarm ourselves and blind ourselves to the danger that \nsurrounds us is an invitation to those who see that as a means for them \nto use terrorism to accomplish their political goals in this world in \nwhich we live.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment today. I thank the \nmanager of the bill for this time and I yield back any remaining time \nto him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I understand the other side has 3 minutes \nremaining, and I think the Senator from Massachusetts wants to wind up. \nIt would be our intention to yield back our time unless somebody comes \nto the floor who has not been heard. So at this point I yield to the \nSenator from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Finally, Mr. President, my friend from Texas does not \nstate our amendment correctly. We are only dealing with the mini nuke \nand the bunker buster, not the safety of the stockpile or the study of \ninformation that happens in other countries. The fact of the matter is, \nthis administration does have a plan for the development of the bunker \nbuster and the small nuclear weapon. There is no doubt about it. It \nsays so in its Nuclear Posture Review.\n  It puts in motion a major change in our approach to the role of \nnuclear offensive forces in our deterrent strategy and presents a \nblueprint for transforming our strategic posture. That is the beginning \nof a new arms race.\n  It is not what I say; it is in their budget request that goes on for \n5 or 7 years and asks for $485 million for the bunker buster and $84 \nmillion for the small nukes. That is what the administration basically \nwants. This is what their principal responsible officials in the \nadministration have said.\n  Linton Brooks:\n\n       I have a bias in favor of things that might be usable. I \n     think that's just an inherent part of deterrence.\n\n  Fred Celec, former deputy assistant to the Secretary of Defense: If a \nhydrogen bomb can be successfully designed to survive a crash through \nhard rock or concrete and still explode, ``It will ultimately get \nfielded.''\n  There it is. That is what we are dealing with. We believe, if we go \nthis route, it is going to make it more difficult to achieve arms \ncontrol in the area of nuclear arms. It is going to make our goals \nharder to realize and make the possibility of nuclear war more likely.\n  Interestingly, the House of Representatives, in their conclusions on \nthis same issue, provides no funds for advanced concepts research and \nthe robust nuclear earth penetrator. Our bill does provide a \nsignificant increase in weapons dismantlement, and for security \nupgrades in the weapons complex for nuclear nonproliferation, the \ncommittee provides the request for $1.3 billion. We spend the resources \non other high-priority nonproliferation needs.\n\n  That is the conclusion of the Republican House of Representatives. \nThey seem to get it.\n  Rather than start into a new arms race with nuclear weapons, let us \naccept our amendment and rely on what we have relied on, which the \nSecretary of State, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Colin \nPowell, recognized--that these were not small nukes and were not \nbattlefield weapons. They did not have a place in our military. That is \nwhat the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said. No one is \nsuggesting that he hasn't had a life and career in terms of security of \nthis country.\n  We have the best in terms of conventional forces. Why go ahead and \nsee nuclear proliferation in terms of weapons that will create \nincreased dangers for the American people?\n  I yield the remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, it is our intention to yield our time. \nHowever, I repeat: This is a feasibility study. It is nothing more than \nthat. You can quote all these other people whose opinion is we should \nhave this. It doesn't make any difference. If the feasibility study \nsays we should go into R and production, we can do that. If the 5-\nyear plan says they come up with that recommendation, we can do that. \nBut, first, the feasibility study would have to be done. Then the \nPresident would have to make a request, and both Houses of Congress \nwould have to authorize it. This is just a feasibility study. We voted \non this last year. I have sent for the vote. We will have it down here \nto remind people how they voted. Nothing has changed.\n  I yield the remainder of our time and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous cosent that the order for \nthe quroum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I think we have had a very good debate. I \nthank colleagues on both sides of the aisle for participating in the \ndebate this morning--the Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Inhofe; Senator \nAllard; the Senator from Texas; and many of us.\n  While the vote had been scheduled for a little later to accommodate \nthe needs of several Senators, I ask the desk to recognize that all \ntime has been yielded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. WARNER. Therefore, if it is agreeable with my colleague from \nMichigan, we will have a vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we have no objection. However, there may be \nsome Senators who relied on this vote starting later, and we ought to \naccommodate them and keep the vote open a little longer.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.

Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Colorado and all \nothers who participated in what I felt was one of the better debates we \nhave had in some time on a very serious issue. I commend the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts and others for the manner in which we conducted the \ndebate.\n  Mr. President, I will now propound a unanimous consent request.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the time from 2:15 to 3:40 be equally \ndivided between the opponents and proponents of the Smith amendment No. \n3183; provided further, that at 3:40, the Senate proceed to executive \nsession for the consideration en bloc of the following nominations: \nVirginia Hopkins, Ricardo Martinez, and Gene Pratter.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that there be 20 minutes of debate \nequally divided between the chairman and ranking member of the \nJudiciary Committee, or their designees, and that at 4 o'clock today \nthe Senate proceed to a vote in relation to the Smith amendment No. \n3183, with no amendments in order to the amendment prior to the vote.\n  I further ask that following that vote, the Senate then proceed to \nconsecutive votes on the confirmation of Executive Calendar Nos. 563, \n564, and 566, with 2 minutes of debate equally divided prior to each \nvote. I finally ask that following these votes, the President be \nimmediately notified of the Senate's action and the Senate resume \nlegislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, following \nthis series of votes, we will return to the Defense bill. At that time, \nthere has been an agreement--at least it is my understanding that a \nCrapo amendment will be laid down.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, that is correct.\n  Mr. REID. That amendment would be set aside and Senator Cantwell \nwould lay down an amendment, and we will do our best to work out a time \nto vote on those amendments.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Following the offering of the Cantwell amendment, the next \none in order is the amendment by Senator Durbin on our side, so people \nunderstand that.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, if I may inquire, we have a pending \namendment. What is the plan for dealing with amendments that have been \noffered and set aside? Do we try to resolve these matters in \nnegotiation, or is there a schedule by which we will vote on these?\n  Mr. WARNER. The issue I am familiar with is the one the Senator from \nConnecticut and I debated which has sections (a) and (b).\n  Mr. DODD. Correct, the contractors.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, did the Senator reach any conclusions as \nto whether he wants to amend his amendment?\n  Mr. DODD. We may very well. I have not had a chance to speak with \nstaff. I will be happy to speak with them in the next hour.\n  Mr. WARNER. I am hoping we can act on that amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If whoever has the floor will yield, I understand we have \nnow received the documents. We received the documents which we sought \nfrom the Army. I have not read them yet, and I do not know if the \nSenator has had a chance to review them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia has the floor.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, it is my understanding that the time is \nequally divided between the distinguished Senator from Oregon on this \nside and the Senator from Massachusetts on the other. Am I correct on \nthat?\n  Mr. LEVIN. As I understand it, Mr. President, both are proponents of \nthe amendment. I do not know who would be controlling the opponents' \ntime. Is there opposition? If so, I wonder if the chairman knows who \nthe opponents are who would be controlling the time.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Michigan \ndoes raise a valid point. I will provide the Senate with the individual \nthat controls the opponents' time momentarily.\n  Mr. LEVIN. In terms of the proponents' time, I understand that will \nbe divided between the Senator from Oregon and the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon will control the time.\n  The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, first may I express my appreciation to \nthose who have agreed to this time agreement about an issue that is \nlong overdue for our Senate to take up once again and to vote on its \nmerits. This is the issue of hate crimes. This is an issue that is much \nin the news of late because it is an issue that too often is visited on \nthe American people, or classes of Americans within the American \ncommunity.\n  We are in the midst of a war on terror, and as we fight that war on \nterror abroad, it is important we not forget the war on terror at home. \nWhat Senator Kennedy and I are trying to do in this bill is to simply \nremind the American people that there are classes of Americans who are \nuniquely vulnerable, who are singled out for violence, and for whom we \nneed to do something.\n  It is a fact that hate crimes statutes are on the books of well over \n30 States in America. They are even on the books of the U.S. \nGovernment. The Federal Government now has authority to pursue, \nprosecute, and punish those who commit hate crimes on the basis of \nrace, religion, or national origin. What we are proposing to do in this \nbill is to add a few categories.\n  There is one category, one class of Americans that is the problem in \nthis amendment, as some view it a problem, and that is the gay and \nlesbian community.\n  Now, many may wonder why we are bringing up this issue on a Defense \nauthorization bill. And the answer is simply because some of the worst \nhate\n\n[[Page S6764]]\n\ncrimes in recent memory have been committed in the U.S. military. It \nclearly is not unique to the American military because it happens all \nover the place, even in my State of Oregon, and notably, for example, \nin Texas with the death, murder, and dragging of James Byrd, and the \nsavage beating of Matthew Shepard in Wyoming. But why the military \nbill? My answer is, why not? This is a bill that needs to move. It is \nimportant that we pass the defense authorization. It is important that \nwe deal with this issue of domestic terrorism.\n  A hate crime is when someone with an ill-motive singles out an \nAmerican citizen--or any person, but an America citizen--who, because \nof his sexual orientation, is hated and even killed. This happens way \ntoo often. In fact, if it happens at all, it is too often.\n  As I recounted yesterday in the case of several of our servicemen, a \nNavy man and an Army private were literally beaten to death. It is \nappropriate that we take up this issue on the Defense authorization \nbill.\n  Many of my colleagues will ask, Why are you trying to punish thought? \nI think it is important to recount that we are not punishing thought. \nWe are not punishing speech. We are, in fact, punishing thought and \nspeech that amounts to conduct, and that conduct then becomes criminal.\n  Many people say this is not appropriate to put in statute. We put it \nin statute a long time ago in the Federal Government. We did it in \nresponse to civil rights laws that were not being enforced in the \nSouthern States--or a few of them. And the Federal Government needed to \nhave some mechanism--some legal reach--to punish and pursue those who \ncommitted hateful things against the communities of African-American \ncitizens. What this did was generate litigation when the Federal \nGovernment pursued it. It took the litigation all the way to the United \nStates Supreme Court.\n  I think it is important that we recount that we are not going after \nanybody's hateful thinking or their hateful speaking but for the \ncombination of those things--with hateful conduct which amounts to \ncrime.\n  When this case came to the United States Supreme Court, you might \nhave expected that conservatives would have struck it down. But it was \nan overwhelming vote by the United States Supreme Court, and the \nmajority opinion affirming hate crimes as a category was written by \nnone other than William Rehnquist, our current Chief Justice. It is \nhard to imagine a more conservative Justice. He made it very clear.\n  Citing the great Jurist William Blackstone, Rehnquist opined that \n``it is reasonable that among crimes of different natures those should \nbe most severely punished which are the most destructive of the public \nsafety and happiness.''\n  Further, Rehnquist added:\n\n       Deeply ingrained in our legal tradition is the idea that \n     the more purposeful is the criminal conduct the more serious \n     is the offense and, therefore, the more severely it ought to \n     be punished.\n\n  Obviously, in the case of James Byrd, when his murderers were \nultimately subject to the death penalty, you can't punish that any more \nseverely. But what was different in that case, because it involved \nrace, was the Federal Government had the statutory right to be there to \nback up and help to reinforce the State of Texas should they have \nneeded it.\n  In the case of Matthew Shepard--in the case of Wyoming where there is \nno authorization for the Federal Government to help because our hate \ncrimes do not include sexual orientation--the sheriff's office in \nLaramie--I met the sheriff, a good Republican--pled for this law. He \nsaid: We needed the help. It was a case of national importance, and we \nneeded the backup of the Federal Government to manage all that happened \naround the pursuit and the prosecution and the punishment of Matthew \nShepard's murderers.\n\n  But what is really important to emphasize--and some of my friends \nwill come to the Senate floor and say we are punishing thought; we are \ninfringing upon the first amendment because we are going after people \nbecause of what they speak. The answer, as Rehnquist and others have \nsaid, is, no, we are not. We only do it if they act upon it. When \ncriminal conduct is more serious because it is so heinous with the \nevidence around it, you can even more severely punish that crime.\n  I think it is very important to hit on one other thing before I turn \nto my colleague, Senator Kennedy.\n  Many people wonder why we would do this, why we would add this \ncategory.\n  My mother used to teach me to treat people the way they would like to \nbe treated--not just the way I would like to be treated. I cannot think \nof a more Christian or decent thing to do than come to the aid of \nsomeone who is in physical peril, or to prosecute their case when they \nhave been wronged, regardless of what you think of their life or \nlifestyle.\n  I believe the moral imperative that underpins hate crimes legislation \nis simply this, and it comes from sacred writ: When people are being \nstoned in the public square, we ought to come to their rescue. That \nincludes the Federal Government, but that does not include the Federal \nGovernment according to our statutes today. What Senator Kennedy and I \npropose to do would change that--- and change it for the good.\n  This is not about endorsing anyone's lifestyle. This is about \nprotecting Americans in any class or category in which they may find \nthemselves.\n  We need to do this. We need to pass this amendment. It is long \noverdue.\n  I understand the reluctance on the part of some of my colleagues \nbecause of their dislike of the entire category of hate crimes, but I \ndisagree with them. I understand them, but I disagree with them because \nof this: The position, if you do not like hate crimes as a category and \ndon't want to expand it to a new class of people, says you really have \nto then strike from our books the hate crimes protections for race, \nreligion, and national origin. I don't think any of my colleagues would \ncome down here and try to do that, particularly after those categories \nhave been found constitutional across the street by the judicial branch \nof Government.\n  But I think, because you can demonstrate clearly the gay and lesbian \ncommunity is demonstrably more vulnerable to crime because of their \nsexual orientation, we owe it to them as Americans--our American \nbrothers and sisters--to add this extra measure of law and protection.\n  I urge my colleagues, I plead with them, to vote for this hate crimes \nlegislation, known officially as the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement \nAct. It is symbolic, yes, but it can be substantive because the law can \nteach. The law is a good teacher, and the laws will then teach \nAmericans that bigotry will not be tolerated. By changing the law, we \ncan change hearts and minds, and I urge my colleagues to do so--to \nchange hearts and minds, even change maybe their own minds and join \nwith me and Senator Kennedy in voting in favor of this most important \nand timely amendment.\n  Congress must take up and carry the torch of freedom and liberty so \ncherished by our forefathers. It is only through our ever vigilance \nagainst hate and those acts that threaten life, liberty and happiness \nof all Americans that we can achieve a just society.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 6 minutes on the \nlegislation.\n  I want the history of this legislation to understand what a very \nimportant and significant role my friend and colleague, the principal \nsponsor of this legislation, the Senator from Oregon, Gordon Smith, has \nplayed in giving us the opportunity on the floor of the Senate to vote \non an issue of enormous importance and consequence in terms of justice \nin our country, and to be able to express what this Nation is really \nabout; that is, that when we are going to be facing hate crimes, we are \ngoing to use every possible tool we have to deal with these crimes. We \nare not going to battle them with one hand tied behind our back.\n\n  I have enjoyed the chance to work with Senator Smith on this \nlegislation over a number of years. We have had some successes in \ntrying to get it through the Senate, but we have failed. However, I \nadmire my friend and colleague's perseverance. As Shakespeare says, \nperseverance, Lord, make honor bright, and the Senator from Oregon has \nenhanced the honor in the Senate\n\n[[Page S6765]]\n\nby giving us an opportunity to address this issue.\n  For those listening to these remarks, they may not understand how \ncomplicated it is to get a real vote on some matters which are basic \nand of fundamental importance. On many occasions when they have opposed \nthe legislation, Members try to undermine the central thrust of the \nlegislation, divert it with parliamentary tactics.\n  The Senator, because of the respect Members have for him, has been \nable to ensure that the Senate will address this issue frontally, and \nit should, because it is a defining issue in terms of our country and \nour society about what this country represents. On the issues dealing \nwith hate crimes, we find them to be completely unacceptable in this \ncountry.\n  We have learned from past experience, in other hate crimes \nlegislation, where the gaps in the legislation have been. This \nlegislation is very targeted, limited, but an important legislative \neffort to try to address those serious loopholes in a way which is both \nconstitutional, is limited, but also effective and can make an \nimportant difference in terms of reducing the incidence of hate crimes.\n  I am sure my friend remembers a number of years ago we had the \nproliferation of church burnings in this country, primarily focused in \nthe southern part of this Nation. After a good deal of deliberation, we \nwere able to get the FBI involved in church burnings. The difference we \nsaw was virtually almost overnight. Once America understood in \ndifferent places of the country that we were serious about making sure \nwe would use the full resources of our National Government to halt \nchurch burnings, it is amazing how they were effectively halted. There \nare still a scattering of them in some communities but effectively the \nepidemic we were seeing at that time has halted.\n  The Senator from Oregon and I believe we can make the similar type of \nprogress on the issues of hate crimes. That is why this is such an \nopportunity.\n  I will take a few moments later to describe the appropriateness of \nthis amendment on this legislation and the particular challenges we \nhave been faced with in the military. As an Armed Services Committee \nmember who has reviewed and watched that closely, I will come back to \nthis issue. However, let me point out this is entirely relevant to this \nlegislation. We have seen that hate crimes have taken place in the \nmilitary. A number of occasions I will describe or place in the Record.\n  On one particular occasion it was based upon race. We saw a \ncommanding general perform in an extraordinarily exemplary way, and on \nanother occasion, when dealing with a young gay man, the performance \nwas abysmal. The fact is, we ought to make sure that certainly the \nArmed Forces are going to understand we are not going to tolerate the \nissues of hate crimes in the military or in any other place in our \nsociety.\n\n  It has been argued that our bill is discriminatory because it singles \nout hate crimes from other crimes when, in fact, all crimes are hate \ncrimes. That is not true. It is not supported by the history or the \nlaw. Every crime is tragic and harmful and has its consequences because \nnot all crime is based on hate. Hate crimes are based on bigotry or \nprejudice. A hate crime occurs when the perpetrator intentionally \nselects the victim because of who the victim is.\n  Mr. WARNER. If the Senator will yield, the Chair inquired as to the \nmanagement of the time in opposition, and I ask unanimous consent that \nany Senator desiring to speak in opposition could speak for up to 10 \nminutes. If he or she desires additional time, we can seek an \nadditional UC for another 10 minutes, and if a quorum is put in it will \nbe charged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SMITH. I further ask that the request be modified to reserve to \nSenator Kennedy and myself any time unused after his remarks.\n  Mr. WARNER. Absolutely.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I don't expect we will have numerous speakers, but it \ncould happen that all the time will be taken up by people using 10 \nminutes.\n  So as I understand what the Senator is saying, those who want to \nspeak may speak up to 10 minutes, but within the general timeframe the \ntotal time is divided.\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask that interlude not be charged against my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. As with acts of terrorism, hate crimes have an impact \nfar greater than the impact on the individual victims and their \nfamilies. They are crimes against entire communities, against the whole \nNation, and against the fundamental ideals of liberty and justice for \nall on which America was founded.\n  As Attorney General Ashcroft has said, criminal acts of hate run \ncounter to what is best in America, our belief in equality and freedom.\n  According to the surveys conducted by the Department of Justice, 85 \npercent of law enforcement officials believe hate-motivated violent \ncrimes are more serious than similar crimes not motivated by bias. One \nneed look no further than the current conflict in the Middle East or \nrecall the ethnic cleansing campaigns in Bosnia, Rwanda, what is \nhappening in the Sudan today, study the Holocaust itself, to understand \nthat violence motivated by hate is different and is more destructive. \nOr consider the hate crimes committed in America. Most of them are \ncommitted by multiple offenders against a single victim.\n  Because the victims are attacked simply because of who they are, \nthere is little that can be done to avoid being a victim of a hate \ncrime. Hate crimes are twice as likely as other crimes to involve \ninjury to the victim and four times as likely to require \nhospitalization.\n  In the 1993 decision in Wisconsin v. Mitchell, a unanimous Supreme \nCourt recognized that bias-motivated crimes are more likely to provoke \nretaliatory crimes, inflict distinct emotional harms on their victims, \nand incite community unrest.\n  A hate crime against one member of a group sends a strong message to \nthe other members that you are next, that certain parts of the country \naren't safe for you to work or travel or live in, that you better watch \nyour step. This is domestic terrorism, plain and simple, and it is \nunacceptable.\n  Centuries ago, Blackstone commented it was unreasonable that among \ncrimes of a different nature, those should be most severely punished, \nwhich are the most destructive of the public safety and happiness.\n  The simple fact is that hate crimes are different. They are more \ndestructive than other crimes. The Federal Government has a \nresponsibility to send a clear and unambiguous message that hate-\nmotivated violence in any form from any source will not be tolerated.\n  Congress recognized the special harm caused by hate-motivated bias \nwhen it passed the current hate crimes law following the assassination \nof Dr. King in 1968, when it passed the Hate Crimes Statistics Act of \n1990, and when it passed the Hate Crimes Sentencing Enhancement Act of \n1994. Now it is time for Congress to take the next step toward \nprotecting all Americans from the problems of hate-motivated violence, \nby passing the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act to address the \nobvious deficiencies in the current Federal hate crimes law.\n  As we mentioned, we are going to have our time. We hope those who \nmight be in opposition would come over to the Chamber to debate us.\n  I think before I yielded myself 7 minutes. Do I still have a little \ntime left on that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed the time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 additional minutes.\n  First of all, I know the Senator from Oregon, Mr. Smith, has \ndescribed this amendment, but what this amendment does is it authorizes \nthe Justice Department to assist State and local authorities in hate \ncrimes cases. It authorizes Federal prosecutions only when a State does \nnot have jurisdiction or when a State asks the Federal Government to \ntake jurisdiction or when a State fails to act against hate-motivated \nviolence.\n  In other words, the amendment establishes an appropriate backup for\n\n[[Page S6766]]\n\nState and local law enforcement to deal with hate crimes in cases where \nStates request assistance or cases that would not otherwise be \neffectively investigated and prosecuted. So this is very limited and \ntargeted.\n  I want to remind the Senate that the original hate crimes preventive \nlegislation was introduced in 1997 in the 105th Congress. The Senate \nJudiciary Committee held hearings in the 105th Congress and the 106th \nCongress. We had testimony from State and local law enforcement, the \nJustice Department, victims and families, and respected constitutional \nlawyers alike.\n  Our hate crimes bill has passed the Senate twice. In July of 1999, we \npassed it as an amendment to the Commerce-Justice-State appropriations \nbill. The amendment was stripped out in conference. In June of 2000, \nthe bill was passed as an amendment to the Department of Defense \nauthorization bill by a vote of 57 to 42. So there is precedent for \nthis action. We had good bipartisan support.\n  Several months later, the House of Representatives voted 232 to 192 \nto instruct the conferees to accept the hate crimes bill. Again, \nhowever, the bill was stripped in conference.\n  In the 107th Congress, the Local Law Enforcement Act was introduced \nwith 51 original cosponsors and favorably reported out of the Judiciary \nCommittee by a vote of 12 to 7. In June of 2000, the Senate failed to \ninvoke cloture on it with a vote of 54 to 43, with a clear majority \nsupporting it.\n  So this issue has been studied. We have had extensive hearings. We \nhave listened to the constitutional authorities. We have listened to \nlocal, State, and Federal officials with regard to this issue. We have \nalso read the newspapers of this country and have studied what has been \nhappening in the growth of hate crimes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed the time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will come back to that in a moment.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes, I yield.\n  Mr. SMITH. I say to the Senator, I wonder, as you recounted some of \nthese horrendous acts that have occurred, if you are familiar with the \nWisconsin case that is called Wisconsin v. Todd Mitchell. It is the \n1993 case in which Chief Justice William Rehnquist authored the \ndecision upholding hate crimes legislation. As it says in \nthis preamble:\n\n       The question presented in this case is whether this penalty \n     enhancement is prohibited by the First and Fourteenth \n     Amendments. We hold that it is not.\n\n  Sir, this was a unanimous decision. And Justice Rehnquist--again, you \nwould probably agree with me, I say to the Senator--is one of the more \nconservative justices. He wrote:\n\n       Thus, although the statute punishes criminal conduct, it \n     enhances the maximum penalty for conduct motivated for a \n     discriminatory point of view more severely than the same \n     conduct engaged in for some other reason or for no reason at \n     all. Because the only reason for the enhancement is the \n     defendant's discriminatory motive for selecting his victim. . \n     . .\n\n  And that was the man's race.\n  Justice Rehnquist held it is entirely appropriate to look at the \nman's motive in ultimately ascribing the severity of the penalty that \nwas handed down for this assault that was made by a White man on a \nBlack man. It was prosecuted under the Federal Hate Crimes Act.\n  I am sure the Senator is familiar with that. Maybe he can help me to \nexplain to my conservative colleagues how it is that we are trying to \nlegislate thought or punish thought and punish speaking. Would the \nSenator agree with me that Justice Rehnquist and I are both right in \nsaying we are only punishing conduct and the evidence that comes from \nthought and speech that can be used legitimately, constitutionally to \nenhance penalties?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for raising this \nissue because this is enormously important. The Senator from Oregon, in \nterms of protection of the first amendment, has reviewed the holding in \nthe Wisconsin case.\n  As the Senator remembers, this principle was reaffirmed this last \nyear by the Supreme Court in the cross burning decision in Virginia v. \nBlack. As we know, as it has been interpreted, this act punishes \nviolence, not speech. It covers only violent acts that result in death \nor bodily injury. It does not prohibit or punish speech, expression, or \nassociation in any way, even hate speech--even hate speech.\n  Those great lines of Oliver Wendell Holmes:\n\n       If there is any principle of the Constitution that more \n     imperatively calls for attachment than any other it is the \n     principle of free thought--not free thought for those who \n     agree with us but freedom for the thought that we hate.\n\n  We ensure that even the hate speech is not affected in this. It is \nthe violence, the physical violence that we are addressing, and it is \nenormously important that our colleagues understand that.\n  Mr. President, I withhold the remainder of the time.\n  I suggest that we have the quorum call, and I suggest that we have it \non the opponents' time until it reaches where we are, and then we will \ncharge it to both of us if that is acceptable.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, if I can modify the request, I think in \nfairness to my colleagues who disagree with me, we better charge it \nequally.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania be \nadded as a cosponsor to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I think we had 42 minutes, and we divided \nthat up formally. May I ask, of the 21 minutes, how much time have I \nused?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The proponents have 12 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Twelve minutes. That is all that remains between both of \nus, Senator Smith and I?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No, for the proponents.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We are both proponents.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The opponents have 37 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  I will put more information in the Record, but I want to point out to \nour colleagues the growth of hate crimes in this country, what the \nSouthern Law Poverty Center has said has taken place. That is the \nauthoritative group, more so than even the Justice Department. The \nnumber of hate groups in America has expanded exponentially ever since \n9/11. The figures we have here are basically dated figures, because \nthey don't go in until after 9/11, but what we do see is the total \nnumber of hate crimes statistics during the period of the 1990s have \nbeen going higher and higher. Hate crimes based on sexual orientation \nhave gone up significantly over the last several years. The venom and \nthe hate against gays and lesbians has increased dramatically.\n  The backlash since 9/11 has been dramatic with regard to hate crimes \nagainst Muslims. This chart shows the dramatic increase and it is \ncontinuing to go up at an extraordinary level. Hate crimes against Arab \nAmericans and hate crimes against Arabs have gone up dramatically in \nthe last 2 years. Beyond that, hate crimes against Jews in the country \nand society have gone up exponentially as well. For all of these \ngroups, I will include accurate information. But this is a real \nproblem.\n  There is the possibility of not having a universal solution, and we \ndon't suggest that with the passage of this amendment all of these \nproblems are going to go away. But what we are going to say is, we \nought to be battling this with the full force of the U.S. Government. \nWhen we guarantee the kinds of rights and liberties in this country \nthat are in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, we ought to make \nsure they are going to be enforced with the full power and authority of \nthe United States. That is what our legislation does in dealing with \nthe issue of hate crimes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n[[Page S6767]]\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, inasmuch as our colleagues are not here to \ndebate Senator Kennedy and me, I hope that is a good sign. I thought I \nwould recount very briefly again the appropriateness of why this is on \nthe military authorization bill, recounting the stories of two service \npeople. They are somewhat horrendous, but it is appropriate that \neveryone understand why this has a very logical nexus for Senator \nKennedy and me with this piece of legislation and this amendment.\n  One of these crimes resulted in the death of an Army private and the \nother the death of a Navy seaman. In 1992, Navy Seaman Allen R. \nSchindler was brutally murdered by his shipmate Terry Helvey in \nOkinawa, Japan. Helvey beat and stomped Schindler to death simply \nbecause he was gay. He didn't want his wallet; he didn't want his \nwatch; he wanted him dead because of his sexual orientation.\n  Helvey's attack was so vicious that he destroyed every organ in \nSchindler's body. He was so badly beaten that Schindler's own mother \ncould identify him only by the remains of the tattoo on his arm. The \nmedical examiner compared Schindler's injuries to those sustained by \nthe victims of fatal airplane crashes.\n  In another tragic case, PFC Barry Winchell was forced outside his \nbarracks at Fort Campbell Army Base where he was stationed. In the \nearly morning hours of July 5, 1999--this is very recent history--\nWinchell was repeatedly beaten with a baseball bat by another Army \nprivate. He was beaten with such force and his injuries were so severe \nthat he died shortly thereafter. Barry was only 21. He was murdered, \nagain not for his watch, not for his wallet, but simply because he was \ngay.\n  These are appalling examples. Again, I want to say for the Record, I \nunderstand the reluctance of some of my colleagues to deal with issues \nthat involve a person's sexuality, but I also want to say I don't agree \nwith them. I think we need to treat people civilly and in the highest \nChristian traditions, no matter what we think of their lifestyles. I \nthink the finest example we can find on this issue--really on point--is \nthe great New Testament example when, in my view, the greatest person \nwho ever lived was confronted with a woman being stoned to death \nbecause of her lifestyle. He did not endorse her lifestyle, but He \nrisked His life to save her life. It does seem to me that if this can \nbe done in ancient Israel, we ought to be able to do the same in modern \nAmerica and have laws that reflect the very best part of the American \npeople, that we stand and help those in need. You need read no more \ninto it, no more moral approval in it.\n  I believe there are real family values, and I believe there are \ncounterfeit family values. Arguments made to suggest that opposing hate \ncrimes is a family value are truly misguided. When it comes to human \nnecessities of making a living and having shelter and enjoying public \nsafety, having the dignity and respect of law on your side, that is for \nall of us, I don't care how we conduct our lifestyles. That is for the \nAmerican people. It includes gays and lesbians.\n  We are not censoring speech. We are not punishing thought. We are \npunishing crime. The statutes that are constitutional in this \ngovernment, upheld by William Rehnquist as to their constitutionality, \nare long overdue to be added to to include this category of the \nAmerican people who are gay and lesbian. The need is easy to \ndemonstrate through statistics, through crimes committed on this \ncommunity. Those of us who stand with the President in fighting the war \non terrorism, I say great, but don't forget the war on terrorism at \nhome. It includes defending gays and lesbians and other Americans and \nclasses that make them vulnerable and more likely victims of crime. We \nowe them that, and we owe them at least that. We owe them more, in \nfact.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the Defense bill we are working on today \nis critically important for our Nation. We need to complete that bill. \nIt is important for us not to be distracted from it by bringing up \namendments about which people feel strongly and which may be important, \nbut are unrelated to defense and not germane to the issue before us.\n  I am glad we are able to at least proceed fairly promptly to a vote \non this issue so that we can get back to the purpose with which we are \ndealing. We have soldiers in the field who are at risk this very \nmoment. They need to know we are moving forward on business that \nrelates to them, that deals with the issues that threaten their lives, \nand we need to make sure that we have every possible activity and \nreport in this authorization bill to help them do their jobs better. I \nwanted to say that at the beginning. Sometimes these things happen, and \nwe can offer amendments, but we do not need to do too much of this, in \nmy view.\n  I raise two points about this so-called hate crimes amendment, and \nthe reason that I will be voting against it. Different people can have \ndifferent ideas and different values about how we should deal with this \nissue.\n  First, there is no legitimacy for any attack on any person because of \ntheir sexual orientation in America today. That is unacceptable \nbehavior. It has always been unacceptable. We need to crack down on it \naggressively. In fact, I believe States are doing so, as they do with \nall other crimes that occur throughout our country.\n  I was a Federal prosecutor for 15 years and dealt with the \ndistinctions between Federal and State law on a regular basis. Most \npeople may not realize that if someone robs a gas station, or someone \nshoots your daughter on her way home from school, or someone commits a \nrape, those are not Federal crimes. They are not prosecuted in Federal \ncourt. They cannot be prosecuted in Federal court under normal \ncircumstances. They have always been given over to the States for \nprosecution. That is very important.\n  We have developed and expanded over the years the reach of Federal \nlaw, and in some instances that is quite good, I believe--but in some \ninstances it is very much in dispute. In fact, liberals and \nconservatives say Federal law is reaching over and prosecuting and \ntaking over cases. There are always some State offenses that are \nprosecuted in Federal court. Regardless of the debate, what we have \ndecided to do in the past is each case should be evaluated on its own. \nI will make a couple of points.\n  With regard to this hate crimes legislation, Senator Hatch, the \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, proposed what I thought was a good \npiece of legislation some time ago. That legislation said we would \nconduct a study, in effect, to see what the need of this legislation \nis. I have to tell you, Mr. President, if you want to prosecute \nsomebody for assaulting, shooting, or harming another person, it is \neasier to prosecute that case if you do not have to prove what was in \nthe mind of the person who did it. That is an additional element of a \ncrime, one not easily proven. I know the Presiding Officer is a lawyer \nand skilled in these matters. It is an additional element to the crime \nthat must be proven.\n  If we were to create such a hate crime, we would basically be taking \non an offense that would be a fundamental State crime--an assault, a \nmurder, or assault with intent to kill. You would be transforming that \nkind of crime into a Federal offense, and not only would you have to \nprove all the underlying elements that would be true in a State trial, \nbut you would also have to prove that the person did it for a reason of \nhate, but not just any hate. If you dislike U.S. Senators and you beat \nup one--there may be a Federal law that protects a Senator, I don't \nknow.\n  If there is a State legislator and someone goes and beats them up \nbecause they hate them, because of the way they voted, all right, that \ncan be taken care of in State court. But what would make it a Federal \noffense? Well, if a person hated him, but they hated him for a \nparticular reason--they hated him because of sexual orientation--that \nis why this becomes now a Federal offense rather than a State offense.\n  One can make arguments that this is all right to do. We did that with \nthe\n\n[[Page S6768]]\n\nissue of race in America, and there was a very real reason for it. As a \nsoutherner myself, I am sorry to say that in fact and in reality there \nwere areas in this country where crimes against African Americans were \nprosecuted either not at all or not adequately; there was not proper \npunishment being imposed in those cases and people were denied civil \nrights. At certain periods of time in our Nation's history, feelings \nwere so strong that cases could not be effectively prosecuted. That was \nclear. That was established. That was a fact, unfortunately.\n  So the Federal Government said those kinds of crimes involving race \ncould be prosecuted in Federal court under the civil rights statute \neven though there may be an underlying State offense. That is how those \ncame into effect.\n  Now we are being asked to go one step further. I think maybe we ought \nnot do that. Senator Hatch's study would have analyzed the question of \nwhether offenses involving assaults on gays are being adequately \nprosecuted in America. If they are being adequately prosecuted--and \nmost States would have tougher laws. Most States have death penalty \nlaws. This bill does not provide the death penalty for the murder of \nsomebody under a hate crime. So are those being adequately prosecuted?\n  We know in a case in Colorado that a person committed murder because \nof the victim's sexual orientation, apparently, and was given the death \npenalty in State court. One offense occurred in my home State of \nAlabama, and he was tried and given life without parole. So I am not \naware of those offenses being inadequately prosecuted. That is what I \nam saying.\n  In addition, there is this troubling concept of what is in one's \nmind. If the Social Security office turned a person down for their \ndisability and they did not get a disability paycheck and they spent \nweeks churning it in their heart and soul and their hatred built and \nbuilt and they finally went down to the Social Security office and shot \neverybody, well, that would not meet the definition of hate crime under \nthis statute. It might be a Federal offense because it is the Federal \nSocial Security agency, but if it had been a local State official it \nwould not be a Federal crime. There would be no Federal jurisdiction.\n  So we are being asked to take that extra step into creating a new \noffense in Federal law based on the question of what is in somebody's \nmind when they commit the crime.\n  Classical American jurisprudence has been simple and direct. I know \nas a student in law school I learned about these things and as a former \nprosecutor I have been thinking a lot about it lately. I think \nsometimes even we who have been former prosecutors get overly \naggressive about passing statutes to deal with every wrong that comes \nup.\n  Let's take the burglary statute that is in effect in almost every \nState in America today. It makes it a State crime to break and enter \ninto a dwelling with the intent to commit a felony. Some of them are \nfirst degree, such as when the crime involves an occupied dwelling at \nnight and those are the elements of their crime. That is what we have \ndone for 200-plus years in America and England. It did not say why a \nperson broke into somebody's house or even what kind of felony someone \nmay be intending to commit. It could be rape; it could be robbery; it \ncould be theft. So that is the clarity with which our law \nhas traditionally operated.\n\n  Now we are saying if someone assaults and kills this person because \nthey were mad at him over a girlfriend and hated him for it, that is \nnot a Federal offense, but if a person is angry because of someone \nelse's sexual orientation, that could be a Federal offense. Maybe that \nis justified and some would find it justified, but I think before we \ncontinue down this road of moving into the psychological motivations \nfor a specific act of committing a crime, we ought to ask ourselves: is \nit the kind of problem we know is not being effectively prosecuted and \nhandled in America today, is not being prosecuted and sentenced \neffectively based on the act that was committed, so that now we need to \nfigure out the motive behind the act and make it a Federal crime? That \nis what we need to be thinking about.\n  I do believe Senator Hatch's legislation that he offered some time \nago I think it even passed this body once, although it did not become \nlaw--said let us do a study of that and analyze where we are so we can \ndeal with it.\n  Well, terrorists hate us for various reasons. People hate our \nGovernment. Some of them hate police officers. Would it be a Federal \ncrime to commit murder against a police officer? Not to my knowledge. \nIt would not be a crime to do that if someone hates the police officer \nor hates the jailer who locks up a person in compliance with the law of \nthe land. The jailer could be murdered and that would not be a Federal \noffense.\n  This should not be seen as any kind of referendum on how we think \nabout the treatment of people with various sexual orientations. This is \na great, free country. It is a country that allows behavior people may \nagree with or not agree with. In my view, it is just as much a crime to \ninjure or harm anyone whether it is as a result of their sexual \norientation or any other behavior they may be participating in. Maybe \nsomeone does not like them because they are out there complaining about \nGeorge Bush or complaining about John Kerry and they hate them for \nthat. That would not be a Federal crime if action is taken against \nthem.\n  I do not know that we need to take this step today. In fact, I think \nwe should not. It is something that deserves careful consideration and \nis not to be thrown onto the Defense bill as we are moving forward at \nthis date. Let's think it through. Let's do a study, as Chairman Hatch \nhas suggested. Let's see if there is a real problem out there. If there \nis a problem of failure to enforce the law, then I would say this could \nbe justified. We have done it before with regard to civil rights \nactions. Maybe it would be appropriate to do it now. Frankly, I do not \nsee that today. I think it is a reach in terms of need and creates the \ndanger of criminalizing thought processes rather than actions.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise to comment on the remarks of the \nSenator from Alabama. I join and agree with his remarks. I have said to \nthe Senator from Oregon on more than one occasion, if I believed hate \ncrimes were a proper crime for the Federal Government to be passing on, \nI would vote for this as well as the others, but I do not believe, as \nthe Senator from Alabama stated, we should be criminalizing thought, \nand that is what this does. I have always said the greatest of the \nfreedoms we have in this country is the freedom to believe what we want \nto believe and the freedom to think what we want to think. I know there \nare lots of motivations for people to do things and there are lots of \nbad thoughts out there in people's minds, but we do not criminalize \nthose. We only criminalize them if there are actions taken. We \ncriminalize the action, not the thought.\n  I think protecting the freedom of belief and the freedom to think the \nway one wants to think is an important concept in our country, somewhat \nunique in the American Constitution, and I believe this hate crimes \namendment violates that very premise. So I will vote against this \namendment.\n  I wanted to be clear, as the Senator from Alabama was clear, it is \nnot because of the group that happens to be identified in this \namendment to be subject to hate crimes. It could be any group.\n\n  I will vote no because I believe the premise underlying this criminal \nstatute is faulty. I regret to have to oppose our two colleagues who \nare trying to take a step forward and bring civility and protection to \ncertain people who have been the subject of violence. But I do not \nbelieve this is the right way to do it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, have we used all time on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes. Twelve seconds remain to the opponents.\n  Mr. SMITH. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 2 minutes, and I \nprobably won't use that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, there are few people I like more than my \ncolleagues who are speaking against this\n\n[[Page S6769]]\n\namendment. They know that. They know I respect their right to disagree \nwith me. But I want to state for the record that if I believed what \nSenator Kennedy and I were doing was criminalizing thought, I would \nvote against this amendment. What we are doing is criminalizing \nactions. It is always the case in criminal law that you look at all of \nthe evidence, and if it can establish that words and thoughts have led \nto actions that rise to hate crimes--William Rehnquist, the most \nconservative Justice we probably have on the Supreme Court, and maybe \nsome would argue that a couple others are more conservative--held in a \nunanimous Supreme Court decision that existing hate crimes statutes are \nconstitutional because they do not punish thought. They do not impinge \nupon the first amendment. They do not impinge upon the 14th amendment \nbecause it takes action to commit a crime, and the words and the \nthoughts are simply evidentiary materials that go into motive to \nestablish a crime. You have to establish motive.\n  This is simply an enhanced version of looking at the totality of a \ncrime. If it can rise to a hate crime, it ought to be prosecuted. This \nis the constitutional law of America. We are simply saying there is a \ncategory of Americans out there who ought to be added to settled \nconstitutional law of the Federal Government. We owe them at least \nthis; they deserve no less than a vote on this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Smith \namendment on hate crimes. This amendment mirrors the Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act, which I have been proud to co-sponsor. \nThis bill puts America's values of equality and freedom into action.\n  Hate crimes are one of the most shocking types of violence against \nindividuals. They are motivated by hatred and bigotry. But hate crimes \ntarget more than just one person--they are crimes against a community \nbecause of who they are--because of their race, gender, sexual \norientation, religion or disability.\n  We are a nation that cherishes our freedom. All Americans must be \nfree to go to church, walk through their communities, attend school \nwithout the fear that they will be the target of hate violence. We are \na Nation that is built on a foundation of tolerance and equality. Yet \nno Americans can be free from discrimination and have true equality \nunless they are free from hate crimes. That's why hate crimes are so \ndestructive. They tear at our Nation's greatest strength--our \ndiversity.\n  This amendment does two things--it helps communities fight these \ncrimes and it makes sure that those who are most often the target of \nhate motivated violence have the full protection of our Federal laws.\n  The amendment strengthens current law to help local law enforcement \ninvestigate and prosecute hate crimes. It does this by closing a \nloophole that prevented the Federal Government from assisting local and \nState police at any stage of the investigative process. Simply put--\nthis bill authorizes Federal law enforcement officers to get involved \nif State or local governments want their help. That means local \ncommunities, which often have very limited resources for pursuing these \ntypes of crimes, will have the resources of the FBI and other Federal \nlaw enforcement agencies at their disposal to help them more \neffectively prosecute incidents of hate violence.\n  This amendment also improves current law so it protects more \nAmericans. It broadens the definition of hate crimes to include gender, \nsexual orientation and disability. Today, gay and lesbian Americans, \nwomen and those with disabilities are often targets of hate motivated \nviolence, but existing Federal laws offer these communities no \nsafeguards. That is the weakness in our current law. And that is what \nthis legislation will fix. By passing this legislation today, the \nUnited State Senate says to all Americans that you deserve the full \nprotection of the law and you deserve to be free from hate violence.\n  Hate crimes are crimes against more than one person--these crimes \naffect whole communities and create fear and terror in these \ncommunities and among all Americans. We need look no further than the \nhorrific killings of James Byrd and Matthew Shepard to know the anger \nand grief that families and communities experience because of hatred \nand bigotry. Hate crimes attack the fundamental values of our Nation--\nfreedom and equality. This bill is another step in the fight to make \nsure that in a Nation that treasures these values these crimes do not \noccur.\n  So today I rise to support and urge my colleagues to pass this much \nneeded and timely legislation. It is time that we put these American \nvalues into action and passed this hate crimes bill. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act says that all Americans are valued and \nprotected--regardless of race, religion, gender, sexual orientation or \ndisability.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act, Amendment 3183, proposed by my colleague \nfrom Oregon.\n  I have always believed that we should leave as many decisions as \npossible to the States to decide. Only on rare occasions, and with \ngreat and good cause should the Federal Government try to step in and \nlegislate what the States should do. When we try to legislate ``one \nsize fits all'' solutions to the problems facing the States more often \nthan not we create more problems than we solve.\n  Before we act on this amendment, we should ask ourselves if this new \nlaw that we would create would reduce crime. After all, that should be \nour primary reason for passing new criminal laws. In this case, \nalthough I know it is a well meaning effort to address a serious \nproblem, it won't prevent crime, it will only make a statement about \nit. That's one of the problems with a Federal hate crime bill. If it \npasses, we may think we have taken care of the problem. Unfortunately, \nalthough it may make us feel good, a law like this will do little to \nslow down or stop the cycle of violence in our cities and towns.\n  Another problem with the hate crime bill is its definition of hate \ncrimes. All of the predicate offenses that would qualify as hate crimes \nare already illegal and they are already being prosecuted under \ntraditional categories of crimes. In other words, the States are \nalready aware of the problem and using existing law to address it. In \nthose cases where additional legislation is needed, the States are \ntaking the lead and deciding the matter for themselves. They don't need \nor want us to step in and tell them what they should do.\n  In addition, if we pass this amendment Federal agents and prosecutors \nwill be put in a position in which they will be second guessing the \nefforts of local officials and substituting their own judgment or \npolitical motivations for the judgment of local law enforcement \npersonnel who are dealing with the problem of hate crimes at the scene \nwhere they are committed.\n  The Smith amendment could essentially federalize most crimes. Such an \nexplosion in Federal jurisdiction would require a tremendous expansion \nin the size and scope of Federal law enforcement and Federal \nprosecutors at a time when the States have the capability of \nprosecuting these crimes themselves--and they are doing it. Federal \nprosecutors already have the tools at their disposal to address issues \nlike hate crimes--they just have to make better use of them.\n  All crimes are in some way hate crimes. By enacting hate crime \nlegislation we ironically serve the principle of inequality that this \ntype of legislation seeks to fight against. Violent crimes are horrific \nand should be punished equally, regardless of the particular ``bias'' \nof the perpetrator. A vicious murder should be prosecuted to the \nfullest extent of the law--no matter who the victim is. The value of an \nindividual's life should not depend on their heritage, ethnicity or \nlifestyle. If life truly is a sacred gift we should treat every life \nwith the same dignity and respect we all deserve.\n  To try to read someone's mind, or guess what their real motivation \nwas for committing a crime will never be possible. Crimes aren't \nthoughts, they're actions, and actions which are crimes need to be \naddressed as soon as they are committed. To try to gauge the \nseriousness of a crime based on someone's thoughts is to put an \nadditional burden on law enforcement personnel and prosecutors, not to \nmention the judge and jury who will have to work on and ultimately \ndecide the\n\n[[Page S6770]]\n\ncase. Clearly, putting a greater value on some lives inherently \ndevalues others, and it goes against a basic principle of our legal \nfoundation which is that all are equal in the eyes of the law. Justice \nis swifter when the accused are tried on the basis of what they did \nwithout adding some speculation on the thoughts they might have had \nwhile committing the crime.\n  We have State and Federal laws to punish murder, assault, battery, \nand a long list of other crimes. If these laws are not strong enough \nthen we should make them stronger. We should also be making our \nfeelings known to our neighbors, to our children, in our papers and \nthrough our broadcast media that hatred in any form is wrong. We should \nnot, however, try to make statements with laws that weaken State \nauthority or the rights granted to individuals in the Constitution.\n  Our society must continue to participate in a dialogue on the issues \nof racism, bigotry, and hate. We must pray for direction and guidance \nand work together to ensure that we avoid the kind of hate that may \ngive rise to such crimes in the first place. Hatred in any form is \ndestructive to the very foundation upon which our society is built.\n  If we are to truly address the problem of hate crimes, we must come \ntogether as one, our families, our spiritual and church leaders, our \nlocal and community leaders, and the citizens of our communities to \nfoster and reinforce in our children and all our citizens the \nimportance of treating each other as we would wish to be treated. It is \nsuch a simple lesson--it is never permissible to hurt another. Somehow, \nsome of our children never learned it. Recent and past events make it \nclear that it is a lesson about which every child must be taught, and \nevery adult constantly reminded.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2003, offered as an amendment by my dear \nfriend from Oregon, Senator Smith.\n  Those who have been instrumental in drafting hate crimes legislation \nin the past several Congresses--Senators Kennedy, Smith and others--\nknow I care deeply about this issue. They know I believe that hate \ncrimes are insidiously harmful, that they should be forcefully \nprosecuted, and that the Federal Government has a role to play in \nreducing the incidence of these crimes in our Nation. The concerns I \nhave voiced have always been about what Congress should do at the \nnational level, not about whether we should act.\n  In past Congresses, and again here today, I have felt compelled to \nvoice my opposition to Senator Smith's hate crimes legislation which \nhas essentially remained unchanged over the past several years, and is \nnow being offered as an amendment. My primary concern has been, and \nremains to this day, that this legislation invades an area historically \nand constitutionally reserved to State and local law enforcement \nauthorities, without a demonstrated need for Federal intervention. In \nan effort to do what we believe is right, we simply cannot ignore core \nprinciples of our Constitution.\n  While there is little evidence that the States are failing to \nprosecute hate crimes, I firmly believe that local law enforcement \nauthorities need our help. They need our resources, and they need our \nexpertise. And we, the Federal Government, should stand ready and able \nto provide such assistance. We must proceed, however, in a manner that \ndoes not offend the authorities conferred upon the States by our \nConstitution.\n  As all of my colleagues are aware, this body has considered this \nissue in almost every session of Congress since 1999. I recognize that \nSenator Smith has the necessary support in this body to pass his \namendment. Indeed, his amendment has prevailed twice before. \nRecognizing that a majority of the Members of this body have supported \nSenator Smith's proposal in the past, and in view of the substantial \nconcerns I have about the amendment, over the past few months I have \nworked diligently to improve the legislation so that it may receive \nmuch broader bipartisan support. I have suggested that the proposal \ninclude Federal assistance and a study and an analysis of available \nstatistics. I have also suggested that the amendment be broadened to \ninclude the possibility of the death penalty for those who commit the \nmost heinous of crimes. I also think that the definition and intent \nelements of what is considered to be a hate crime should be \nsignificantly narrowed so that we do not capture every crime that \nhappens to be committed against a member of a particular class. With \nthese changes, the legislation would stand a better chance of becoming \nlaw and surviving constitutional challenges, which we know are certain \nto occur. Despite those concessions, it appears clear that we were \nunable to come to an agreement and I must, therefore, once again stand \nin opposition to two of my dear friends.\n  If we genuinely want to make a difference, if we want to pass \nlegislation that both Houses of Congress will support, let us find a \nbaseline of common ground and resist the temptation to make this a \ndivisive political issue. I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                     Nomination of Virginia Hopkins\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise in support of the confirmation of \nVirginia Hopkins for the United States District Court for the Northern \nDistrict of Alabama. I have reviewed her record and I find her to be an \nexcellent choice for the federal bench. Virginia Hopkins possesses 25 \nyears of legal experience that will serve her well on the federal \nbench.\n  Upon graduating from the University of Virginia School of Law in \n1977, Ms. Hopkins joined the Birmingham, Alabama law firm of Lange, \nSimpson, Robinson & Sommerville, LLP. There she had a broad civil \npractice that included appellate matters, tax and estate planning, \nbusiness dispute resolution and planning, and labor disputes. She also \nworked for another widely respected law firm, Taft, Stettinius & \nHollister LLP. in Washington D.C.\n  In 1991, Ms. Hopkins returned to Alabama to join the firm of Campbell \n& Hopkins LLP., where she is currently a partner. Over the past 12 \nyears, she has developed a broad civil practice, including litigation, \ntax and estate planning, business dispute resolution and planning, \ntrademark and copyright registrations and disputes, trade secret \ndisputes, confidentiality agreement disputes, and trade name disputes.\n  I am confident that she will make a fine addition to the Northern \nDistrict of Alabama.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today we vote on the nomination of Virginia \nHopkins to the Northern District of Alabama. Ms. Hopkins has been an \nattorney at the firm Campbell & Hopkins in Alabama, and has the support \nof both of her home State Senators. In particular, Senator Shelby \ndeserves praise for diligently pressing forward, and this confirmation \nrewards his constant attention to this nomination. Senator Shelby has \nalways been a pleasure with whom to work, whether I was serving as \nchairman or ranking member. Senator Shelby has always been someone who \nplays it straight and shows good judgment. He is fair and forthright.\n  I must note that since May 18, the date of the agreement on judicial \nconfirmations this year involving Senator Daschle, Senator Frist and \nthe White House, the Senate has confirmed seven judges, including two \ncircuit court nominees. We confirmed Marcia Cooke to the district court \nin Florida, Judge Van Antwerpen to the Third Circuit in Pennsylvania, \nand Ray Gruender to the Eighth Circuit the first week of that \nagreement. The following week, the Senate confirmed the nominations of \nDennis Saylor, Sandra Townes, Ken Karas, and Judith Herrera to the \nFederal district courts.\n  Last week, the Republican leadership did not schedule any judicial \nnominations for a vote and considered other business during that \nshortened work week. In the month since the agreement to have a floor \nvote on 25 judicial nominees, the Republicans have asked for votes on \nonly seven judicial nominees and have scheduled debate on a variety of \nmatters other than judicial nominees. That is their choice. The \nRepublican leadership knows that some of the remaining nominees in the \nagreement for votes this year require significant time for debate.\n  I do not want to see the Democrats blamed for any delay in \nconfirmation votes when Republicans have been advised for weeks now \nthat it is going to\n\n[[Page S6771]]\n\ntake time for the Senate to process all of the nominees in the \nagreement. Members of the Senate deserve time to consider the merits of \nthe nominees for lifetime positions. Democrats have been working \ncooperatively on judges but the Republican leadership has not worked \nwith us to schedule the debate and votes on the many remaining judicial \nnominees that we had hoped could be considered before June 25. After \ntoday's three votes, 15 judicial nominees remain to be scheduled for \ndebates and votes. I hope that we can make progress on more nominees \nthis week and next. At the pace the Republican leadership has chosen to \nproceed, there is now a strong likelihood that debate and votes on some \nof these judicial nominees will extend past June 25.\n  On the occasion of the confirmation of this Alabama nominee, I would \nnote that some in the Senate have falsely alleged that Democratic \nSenators have treated southern nominees unfairly. Some extreme \npartisans tried to divide the American people for partisan political \ngain with their false accusations against Democratic Senators. The \ntruth is that Democrats have treated judicial nominees from the South \nvery fairly: Southern States comprise about 25 percent of the States in \nthe Nation, yet out of the 181 judicial nominees of President Bush that \nwe have confirmed as of this vote, 59 nominees, or one-third of the \nconfirmed nominees, have been to judicial seats in the South. In \nparticular, I would note that six of President Bush's judicial nominees \nhave already been confirmed to United States district courts in Alabama \nsince he took office: Judge Karon Bowdre, Northern District; Judge \nCallie Granade, Southern District; Judge Mark Everett Fuller, Middle \nDistrict; Judge L. Scott Coogler, Northern District; Judge R. David \nProctor, Northern District; and Judge William Steele, Southern \nDistrict. Judge Steele, as you may recall, was initially nominated by \nPresident Bush to the Eleventh Circuit, but President Bush pulled down \nthe elevation of this then-U.S. magistrate judge in order to put \nforward the even more controversial William Pryor, who was recess \nappointed earlier this year despite the serious objections of numerous \nSenators. Recent news articles about Judge Pryor's actions on the bench \nhave only underscored the concerns of many that he lacks the political \nindependence and fairness to serve as a judge.\n  Ms. Hopkins received a partial ``Not Qualified'' rating from the \nAmerican Bar Association. Following the White House's exclusion of the \nABA from reviewing judicial candidates before they have the President's \nstamp of approval, a dismaying number of this President's nominees have \nreceived ``Not Qualified'' ratings. Indeed, four of his nominees were \nrated ``Not Qualified'' by a majority of the ABA rating committee, and \n24--more than 10 percent--were rated ``Not Qualified'' by some members \nof the ABA's standing committee.\n  The weight that should be accorded an ABA rating was called into \nquestion after the debacle in which Republican partisan Fred Fielding \nprepared Miguel Estrada's ABA rating recommendation. Mr. Fielding not \nonly served on the White House transition team advising the President \nabout Cabinet appointments, he subsequently cofounded the Committee for \nJustice, which attacks anyone opposed to the President's judicial \nnominees. Similarly, the ABA's rating to Judge Pickering after his \njudicial ethics were called into question by national ethics experts \nundermined the confidence that some in the Senate had in the \nevaluations of the ABA's rating committee. Also, the ABA's ratings do \nnot take into account the President's effort to put so many ideologues \nand extremists into these lifetime positions on the bench.\n  In Ms. Hopkins' case, the ABA rating may reflect her modest trial \nexperience: She has been the sole or chief counsel in only two of the \ncases she has tried to verdict. Ms. Hopkins has been active in \nRepublican fundraising like many of the President's nominees, but I am \nhopeful, given the confidence Senator Shelby has reposed in her, that \nshe will leave her partisan roots behind upon confirmation. Out of \ndeference to Senator Shelby, I will vote in favor of her confirmation.\n  I congratulate Ms. Hopkins on her confirmation.\n\n\n                     Nomination of Ricardo Martinez\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased today to speak in support of \nJudge Ricardo Martinez, who has been nominated to the United States \nDistrict Court for the Western District of Washington. Since 1998, \nJudge Martinez has served as a federal magistrate judge--an experience \nwhich undoubtedly has prepared him well for the district court bench.\n  Judge Martinez has a compelling story. The son of former migrant \nworkers, he lived in a migrant camp for several years during his \nchildhood, where he worked with his parents on the farms. Neither he \nnor his parents understood English, but with the help of his teachers, \nhe mastered the language and became the family's interpreter. He also \nbecame the first in his family to attend high school. Incidentally, he \nwas one of two boys to graduate from high school with honors.\n  Judge Martinez then attended the University of Washington, where he \nearned a Bachelor of Science degree in psychology. He subsequently \ngraduated from the university's law school, where he had been a member \nof the Order of the Coif.\n  Following graduation from law school, Judge Martinez spent 10 years \nas an assistant prosecutor with the King County Prosecuting Attorney's \nOffice where he became chief of the drug unit. After his appointment as \na judge on the King County Superior Court in 1990, he started the \nState's first drug court, which allows those who are arrested on minor \ndrug-related charges to have the charges dropped in exchange for \nstaying drug-free, completing their education and seeking employment.\n  I applaud President Bush for his nomination of Judge Martinez and am \nconfident that he will serve on the bench with compassion, integrity \nand fairness.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today the Senate considers the nomination \nof Ricardo Martinez, to be a United States District Judge for the \nWestern District of Washington. For the past 6 years, he has been a \nwidely respected United States Magistrate Judge for the Western \nDistrict of Washington. Previously, Judge Martinez served as a Superior \nCourt Judge and as an assistant prosecutor in King County, WA. He is a \ngraduate of the University of Washington and of the University of \nWashington Law School, and has substantial trial experience. In light \nof his significant judicial experience it is not surprising that he \nreceived a unanimous rating of ``Well-Qualified'' from the American Bar \nAssociation.\n  Judge Martinez's nomination is the product of a bipartisan judicial \nnominating commission that Senators Murray and Cantwell insisted upon \nin spite of Bush administration opposition. The State of Washington is \nwell-served by its bipartisan judicial nominating commission which \nrecommends qualified, consensus nominees on whom members of both \nparties can agree. It is difficult to understand why President Bush has \nopposed similar bipartisan selections commissions since they help \nDemocrats and Republicans work together and help maintain an \nindependent judiciary. I thank Senators Murray and Cantwell for their \nsteadfast efforts in maintaining the commission.\n  While some people have accused Democrats of being anti-Hispanic, our \nrecord of confirming Hispanic nominees is excellent. Democrats have \nsupported the swift confirmation of President Bush's Latino nominees \nalready, with four more waiting only for a vote on the Senate floor. \nWhile President Clinton nominated 11 Latino nominees to circuit court \npositions, five of those 11 were blocked by the Republican Senate, and \nfour of those five were not even granted hearings. President Bush has \nonly nominated four Latino jurists to circuit court positions, three of \nwhom have already been confirmed with unanimous Democratic support. \nPresident Bush's 21 Latino nominees constitute less than 10 percent of \nhis 225 judicial nominees.\n  Regrettably the President has been more concerned with nominating \nthose affiliated with the Federalist Society. He has nominated 45 such \nnominees. Twice as many nominees have been affiliated with the \nFederalist Society as have been Hispanic. In fact, all of his Hispanic, \nAsian and African American judicial nominees combined do not\n\n[[Page S6772]]\n\nequal the number of those affiliated with the Federalist Society.\n  This confirmation marks the 182nd lifetime judicial appointment \napproved by the Senate during this Presidential term. That is more than \nis all of President Reagan's term from 1981 through 1984 and more than \nin all of President Clinton's more recent term from 1997 through 2000. \nWe have also approved more judicial nominees this Congress than in \neither of the last two Congresses preceding the Presidential elections \nin 1996 or 2000.\n  I strongly support his nomination and I congratulate Judge Martinez \nand his family on his confirmation.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, it is my privilege today to discuss the \nincredibly talented nominee for vacancy on the District Court for the \nWestern District of Washington, Judge Ricardo Martinez. The people of \nwestern Washington will be well-served by this talented and fair \njurist.\n  Given Judge Martinez's reputation for even-handedness and \nthoroughness, it is fitting that he was recommended by a bipartisan \nselection committee that I believe is a sound model for other States. \nMembers of Washington State's legal community, the White House, and my \ncolleague Senator Patty Murray and I worked together to review a group \nof applicants. Together, we all agreed that Judge Martinez is the right \nperson for the job.\n  Judge Martinez has ably served the people of Washington State as a \npublic servant for more than two decades: as prosecutor in the State's \nlargest county for 10 years; as a Superior Court judge for 8 years; and \nas a United States Magistrate judge in the Western District of \nWashington for the past 5 years.\n  While serving on the King County Superior Court, Judge Martinez took \nthe lead in helping to create an innovative ``drug court'' to address \nthe unique challenge of recidivism among drug offenders. He helped \nbuild a consensus to try a new approach, and preside over the new court \nfor three years.\n  And it worked. The``drug court,'' one of the first in the Nation, has \nhelped reduce recidivism rates among those people who successfully \ncomplete the program and it has been emulated by many jurisdictions \nacross the country.\n  Judge Martinez's commitment to his community extends beyond the \ncourtroom. He has volunteered countless hours to help those in need and \nthe homeless; to mentor young people as a coach in several sports; and \nto raise money for college scholarships for young men from \ndisadvantaged backgrounds.\n  Those who have worked with Judge Martinez attest to his fundamental \nsense of fairness and justice. The ABA rated him as ``well-\nqualified''--its highest rating--on a unanimous vote. He also enjoys \nsupport from the Federal bench, and was encouraged to apply for the \nvacancy by all of the incumbent judges of the Western District.\n  I am pleased to offer Judge Ricardo Martinez my full support, and I \nurge my fellow Senators to approve his nomination.\n\n\n                       Nomination of Gene Pratter\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the nomination \nof Gene Pratter to be United States District Judge for the Eastern \nDistrict of Pennsylvania.\n  Gene Pratter, has contributed much to the legal community over her 29 \nyear legal career, specifically in the areas of ethics and professional \nconduct. Upon graduation from University of Pennsylvania Law School, \nMs. Pratter joined the law firm of Duane Morris & Heckscher--now Duane \nMorris LLP. She has remained with this firm since her first days as an \nassociate and is currently a partner in and general counsel of the \nfirm.\n  She has represented numerous clients in commercial litigation and \nprofessional liability. She has also represented licensed law, \nfinancial and other professionals before State and national licensing \nboards and in litigation throughout the country in both federal and \nState courts. She has practiced in a variety of legal issues including \nlitigation and alternative dispute resolution, with emphasis on \ncommercial, securities, employment contract, real estate, insurance \ncoverage, RICO, professional and business ethics, and professional \nliability litigation. She has also represented the Philadelphia Zoo.\n  Additionally, Ms. Pratter has served as an expert witness and has \noverseen legal issues for her law firm, Duane Morris, for a number of \nyears while also holding the position of vice-chair of the firm's Trial \nDepartment. She has also been named as a Judge Pro Tem in the \nPhiladelphia Court of Common Pleas and a mediator for the U.S. District \nCourt for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.\n  Ms. Pratter has been a guest faculty member at the University of \nPennsylvania Law School, where she lectured on the legal profession and \nprofessional responsibility. She also served on the School's Board of \nOverseers from 1993 to 1999. She is active in numerous professional and \ncommunity associations.\n  I have every confidence that she will make an excellent federal \njudge. I commend President Bush for nominating her, and I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting this nomination.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today we vote to confirm another district \ncourt nominee, Gene Pratter to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern \nDistrict of Pennsylvania. Ms. Pratter is currently a partner at the \nfirm Duane Morris LLP, where she has worked her entire career.\n  A look at the Federal judiciary in Pennsylvania demonstrates yet \nagain that President Bush's nominees have been treated far better than \nPresident Clinton's and shows dramatically how Democrats have worked in \na bipartisan way to fill vacancies despite the fact that Republicans \nblocked more than 60 of President Clinton's judicial nominees. With \nthis confirmation, 17 of President Bush's nominees to the Federal \ncourts in Pennsylvania will have been confirmed--a rate not matched in \nany other State but California.\n  With this confirmation, President Bush's nominees will make up 17 of \nthe 42 active Federal circuit and district court judges for \nPennsylvania--that is more than one-third of the Pennsylvania Federal \nbench. On the Pennsylvania district courts alone, President Bush's \ninfluence is even stronger as his nominees will hold 14 of the 33 \nactive seats--or more than 42 percent of the current active seats. With \nthe additional Pennsylvania district court nominees pending on the \nfloor and likely to be confirmed soon, nearly half of the district \ncourt seats in Pennsylvania will be held by President Bush's \nappointees. Republican appointees will outnumber Democratic appointees \nby nearly two to one.\n  This is in sharp contrast to the way vacancies in Pennsylvania were \nleft unfilled during Republican control of the Senate when President \nClinton was in the White House. Republicans denied votes to nine \ndistrict and one circuit court nominees of President Clinton in \nPennsylvania alone. Despite the efforts and diligence of the senior \nSenator from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter, to secure the confirmation \nof all of the judicial nominees from every part of his home State, \nthere were 10 nominees by President Clinton to Pennsylvania vacancies \nwho never got a vote. Despite records showing them to be well-qualified \nnominees, many of their nominations sat idle before the Senate for more \nthan a year without being considered. Such obstruction provided \nPresident Bush with a significant opportunity to shape the bench \naccording to his partisan and ideological goals.\n  Recent news articles in Pennsylvania have highlighted the way that \nPresident Bush has been able to reshape the Federal bench in \nPennsylvania. For example, The Philadelphia Inquirer, on November 27, \n2003, said that the significant number of vacancies on the Pennsylvania \ncourts ``present Republicans with an opportunity to shape the judicial \nmakeup of the court for years to come.''\n  Democratic support for the confirmation of Gene Pratter is yet \nanother example of our extraordinary cooperation despite an \nuncompromising White House and a record that shows Republicans' refusal \nto cooperate on President Clinton's Pennsylvania nominees when they \ncontrolled the Senate and a Democrat resided at 1600 Pennsylvania \nAvenue.\n  Like so many of President Bush's nominees, Ms. Pratter is a member of \nthe Federalist Society and has been involved in numerous Republican \nParty campaigns. She has no judicial experience although she comes from \na well-\n\n[[Page S6773]]\n\nrespected law firm. Her record of defending businesses raises concerns \nabout her ability to balance business and individual interests. In her \nanswers to my written questions, however, she assured me that she would \nbe fair to all parties that come before her. I hope that she will be a \nperson of her word. I hope that she will follow the law. I hope that \nshe will treat all who appear before her with respect. I hope she will \nnot abuse the power and trust of her position. Sometimes we have to \ntake a risk to allow a nominee to be confirmed.\n  I congratulate Ms. Pratter on her confirmation today.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of time in \nopposition.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I believe we have used all our time. \nTherefore, I believe we are ready to vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/15/senate-section/article/S6773-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6773-S6775]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  THE NOMINATION OF VIRGINIA E.

PRATTER TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n                FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to executive session to consider nominations 563, 564, and 566. \nThere will be 20 minutes of debate equally divided between the chairman \nand ranking members of the Judiciary Committee, or their designees. At \nthe conclusion of 20 minutes, we will vote on the nominations, \nfollowing which there will be a vote on the pending amendment.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of Gene \nPratter, who is the nominee, as you noted, on the Executive Calendar \nfor the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.\n  Gene has an outstanding record of community service, of service to \nthe legal community, working in very complex and difficult litigation \nwith a large law firm in the city of Philadelphia. She is someone who \nhas been active, as I mentioned, in the community and in political \nlife, and is the kind of well-rounded individual who I think would make \nan excellent jurist on the court.\n  She is someone I have gotten to know over the past 10 or 12 years, \nand I have respected her demeanor. She has a very professional but yet \ngentle way of discussing sometimes rather contentious issues in which \nwe have been involved.\n  Again, I respect the way she approaches issues that confront her. She \nhas proven that she has outstanding legal abilities. She has proven \nthat she understands the importance of community and the importance of \nbeing a good citizen and participating as a citizen beyond just the \nprofessional life, which to me, as a judge, is something that is very \nimportant.\n  We have been fortunate under the leadership of Senator Specter in \nfinding now 20 judges under this administration who have been \nnominated, and I believe the number is 17 or 18 who have been confirmed \nby the Senate. We have done a good job in finding people who are well \nrounded and people who have judicial experience and judicial \ntemperament about which I spoke, as well as a record of community \ninvolvement and active citizenship which rounds out the person. So when \nthey come to the bench, they are not just a narrow scholar or someone \nwho is a ``hail fellow well met'' but a nice combination of the two \nthat brings the kind of commonsense judicial temperament that is \nimportant in our court system.\n\n  I commend Gene for her steadfastness in this process. As anybody who \nhas gone through this process in the last couple of years will tell \nyou, this is a difficult and somewhat tortuous process where you are on \nagain, off again; You don't know whether your career is going to move \nforward or is going to stay in limbo. Is it going to fall off the \ndocket and not be heard from again? That is a very difficult thing for \nall of these nominees to have to go through.\n  But thanks to the agreement of Senator Frist and Senator Daschle, we \nhave been able to move some of these nominations--the \n``noncontroversial nominations''--and we will now have a vote on Judge \nPratter.\n  I say for the Record again that because of the work Senator Specter \nhas done with our bipartisan nominating commission we have in the State \nof Pennsylvania, we have been able to get Republicans and Democrats--I \nunderscore Republicans and Democrats--nominated by this President.\n  When there are two Republican Senators, we have a rule in \nPennsylvania that the party in power--that means the President--will \nnominate three to his party to every one in the minority party, \nirrespective of, as I said before, the fact that we may have two \nRepublican Senators and a Republican President. Out of every four \nnominees, we still nominate one Democrat to fill the bench to make sure \nthere is a proper balance on the court, and even to some degree some \nlittle ideological balance on the court.\n  We have been successful in getting soon to be 20 nominees approved by \nthe Senate, which I think is a fairly admirable record if you consider \nthe contentious attitude the judicial nominees have had to work through \nin the committee as well as in the Senate.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I speak on behalf of a judicial nominee \nfor the Northern District of Alabama, Virginia E. Hawkins. I join with \nSenator Richard Shelby of my State in moving her nomination forward \nwith great enthusiasm. She is a woman of impeccable academic \ncredentials, high in integrity, great legal experience and skill. She \nwill do a great job on the Federal bench.\n  She has a strong academic background. She graduated from the \nUniversity of Alabama in 1974 as an undergraduate. She attended Agnes \nScott College before that. Then she attended the University of Virginia \nLaw School in 1977. She began her career as an associate attorney at \nthe law firm of Lange, Simpson, Robinson & Sommerville in Birmingham, \nAL. That is one of the great law firms in the State. The fact she was \nhired there in itself is a good commendation of what they thought were \ngood legal skills and good judgment. She certainly would not have been \nselected at that firm had they not thought so at the time.\n  She had at that firm a broad civil practice, including appellate \nmatters, tax and estate planning, business dispute resolution, and \nplanning in labor disputes. These things come up in Federal court, \nalso.\n  She left the firm after 2 years to join the law firm of Taft, \nStettinius & Hollister in Washington, DC, where she established the \nfirm's intellectual property practice and handled complicated trademark \nmatters. It is a fine law firm in Washington for her to be part of.\n  In 1991, however, she and her husband decided to return to her home \nof Anniston, AL, and to form the firm of Campbell & Hopkins where she \nis currently a partner.\n  Over the past 12 years she developed a broad civil practice, \nincluding litigation, tax and estate planning and administration, \nbusiness dispute resolution, and planning intellectual property cases.\n\n[[Page S6774]]\n\n  Simply stated, Virginia Hopkins has a number of career, academic, and \nprofessional achievements. Her experience will be an asset to the bench \nof the Northern District of Alabama.\n  I know her children now are at the age of graduating from high \nschool. She felt the need to come back to her roots to raise those \nchildren in the right way. Now she is so excited about the opportunity \nto serve her country and her Nation and the rule of law as a Federal \njudge. It is exciting to talk to her. It makes me pleased every time I \ndo, to see how excited she is about this opportunity. I believe she is \ngoing to do a terrific job.\n  I know Senator Shelby agrees with that. In fact, he propounded her \nnomination from the beginning. I know he believes in every way she will \nbe a superb Federal judge. I am glad to see the senior Senator from \nAlabama in the Senate today, a distinguished lawyer in his own right.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I am pleased that we will soon be voting \non the nomination of Virginia Hopkins for the United States District \nCourt for the Northern District of Alabama. This nomination has been on \nthe calendar for a number of months now and I am pleased that we are \nfinally going to have an up or down vote.\n  Virginia Hopkins is a highly qualified candidate. She will be an \nimportant addition to the Federal bench. Like others who know Virginia, \nI have a high regard for her intellect and her integrity. She is a \nwoman of the law who understands and respects the constitutional role \nof the judiciary and, specifically, the role of the federal courts in \nour legal system.\n  Having been a practicing attorney for more than a quarter century, \nVirginia has concentrated her legal practice in wills and estate \nplanning, as well as intellectual property law and civil litigation. \nVirginia has a strong record of trying cases in both the federal and \nstate courts for a broad range of individual and corporate clients. \nWithout question, I believe it is fair to say that Virginia Hopkins is \nan experienced and skilled attorney.\n  In addition to being a devoted wife and mother of two children and a \nskilled attorney, Virginia is also active in her community. She has \nserved on the board of the United Way of East Central Alabama, while \nalso remaining active in her church. She is a graduate of the \nUniversity of Alabama and also Virginia Law School.\n  Again, I am pleased to support the nomination of Ms. Virginia Hopkins \nto the United States District Court for the Northern District of \nAlabama. I am confident that she will serve honorably and that she will \napply the law with impartiality and fairness. I encourage my colleagues \nto join with me in supporting her nomination as I believe that she will \nserve our nation with the honor and dignity required of the federal \njudiciary.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. How much time remains for the majority and minority?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 1 minute 44 seconds and the \nminority has 11 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Does the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania wish us to \nyield part of our time?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I would need 5 minutes to speak on behalf \nof the judicial nominee.\n  Mr. REID. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Pennsylvania of the \ntime of the minority.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank my distinguished colleague from Nevada for \nyielding the time. I have sought recognition to urge my colleagues to \nconfirm Gene E.K. Pratter to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern \nDistrict of Pennsylvania. Ms. Pratter comes to this position with a \nvery distinguished academic career, having earned honors at Stanford \nUniversity and her law degree from the University of Pennsylvania in \n1975.\n  She is a partner in the prestigious law firm in Philadelphia of Duane \nMorris where she serves not only as a partner but as general counsel to \nthe firm for their own matters.\n  She has authored many very distinguished legal writings. She has \nserved in many professional capacities as a judge pro tempore for the \nState courts, Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County. She has \nbeen a mediator for the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of \nPennsylvania, so she has had extensive ancillary experience before \nbecoming a Federal judge.\n  I have had the opportunity to know Ms. Pratter personally for about a \ndecade and can personally attest to her intelligence and demeanor. She \nwill be an outstanding judge.\n  She had been recommended to the President by Senator Santorum and \nmyself after she received approval from a nonpartisan judicial \nselection commission which advises Senator Santorum and I as to \njudicial recommendations to the President. This is a group which has \nfunctioned for all of my tenure in the Senate, going back 24 years when \nSenator Heinz and I had this panel in existence. It has been carried \nforward. As I say, it is in existence now by appointment from Senator \nSantorum and myself.\n\n  I am especially pleased to find this confirmation occurring today. We \nhad to postpone the induction ceremony for Ms. Pratter some time ago \nwhen there had been some disagreements as to how we would proceed. We \nhad hoped for this confirmation last week, and, of course, it has been \ndelayed because of the ceremonies involving the funeral and other \nmatters related to former President Reagan. But I am especially pleased \nto have it concluded today because a swearing-in has been scheduled in \nPhiladelphia for Friday at 2 o'clock. So Ms. Pratter, who I am sure is \nwatching, and others will know that the commitment can go forward. That \nis in anticipation of a favorable vote, which I think is virtually \ncertain to be forthcoming.\n  Mr. President, it would take a great deal of time to give the details \nof Ms. Pratter's extensive biographical resume and accomplishments, so \nI ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             Gene E.K. Pratter, Partner and General Counsel\n\n       Gene E.K. Pratter is a partner in and General Counsel of \n     Duane Morris LLP. She frequently represents clients in \n     commercial litigation and professional liability and \n     licensing matters. Ms. Pratter has represented licensed law, \n     financial and other professionals before state and national \n     licensing boards and in litigation throughout the country in \n     federal and state courts.\n       A 1975 graduate of the University of Pennsylvania Law \n     School and an honors graduate of Stanford University, Ms. \n     Pratter is a member of the American Bar Association's \n     Litigation Section and the Philadelphia Bar Association's \n     Committees on Professional Responsibility and Professional \n     Guidance, of which she was chair from 2000 through 2001. In \n     addition, she is a member of the Pennsylvania Bar \n     Association's Women in the Profession Committee. Ms. Pratter \n     served as the co-chair of the ABA Litigation Section's \n     Committee on Ethics and Professionalism and recently \n     concluded her tenure as the co-chair of the Section's Task \n     Force on the Independent Lawyer.\n       A member of the University of Pennsylvania's American Inns \n     of Court, she is the author of a number of articles \n     concerning ethics and professional conduct and has presented \n     many programs for practitioners on those and other subjects. \n     Ms. Pratter frequently serves as an expert witness and \n     advises lawyers and law firms concerning professional \n     responsibility and professional liability matters, and she \n     has overseen legal issues for Duane Morris itself for a \n     number of years while also holding the position of vice-chair \n     of the firm's Trial Department. She has also been named as a \n     Judge Pro Tem in the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas and a \n     mediator for the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District \n     of Pennsylvania.

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. SMITH. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, hatred and violence are not traditional \nvalues and they are not American values. Vicious crimes tear at the \nvery fabric of our society and should be prosecuted to the fullest \nextent of the law.\n  Sixty-five Senators--including 18 Republican Senators--voted today to \nexpand hate crimes protection to all Americans. The overwhelming \nsupport for the hate crimes amendment is a victory for basic fairness \nand for victims' rights.\n  This bipartisan amendment provides more help for local law \nenforcement--and tougher penalties for people who commit hate crimes. \nIt also expands hate crimes protections to include gender, sexual \norientation and disability. These are all reasonable changes that are \nsupported by the overwhelming majority of Americans and by law \nenforcement agencies across the country.\n  Those who say these protections are unnecessary because they protect \nonly a small number of people miss the point. Even one beating, one \nmurder, or one assault is unacceptable. Hate crimes diminish all \nAmericans.\n  This is not the first time the Senate has voted to strengthen \nexisting federal protections against hate crimes. I brought these same \nprotections to the Senate floor when I was majority leader in 2002. \nThey were first introduced in 1997 and passed by the Senate in 1999. In \n2000, majorities in both the House and Senate supported hate crimes \nlegislation--only to have the provisions stripped out behind the closed \ndoors of a conference committee at the insistence of the far right.\n  We urge the far right to end their efforts to prevent these modest \nbut important protections from being signed into law. We will continue \nto press this case until all Americans enjoy equal protection from hate \ncrimes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, today, I voted in support of an amendment to \nthe Department of Defense Authorization Act to establish that hate \ncrimes based on race, color, religion, and national origin are \nprohibited at all times--not only when a person is involved in certain \nfederally protected activities as is the case under existing law. The \nlegislation I voted to enact today for the first time also prohibits \nhate crimes based on three additional categories, meaning a person's \nactual or perceived disability, gender, or sexual orientation, so long \nas the incident has a demonstrable tie to interstate trade.\n  The legislation voted on today is different than the hate crimes \nlegislation I opposed in June 2000 in several significant ways. \nPrimarily, it includes stronger safeguards to ensure that the States \ncontinue to take the lead in prosecuting hate crimes. The language of \nthe amendment makes it clear, though, that the Federal Government can \nprosecute a hate crime at the Federal level in circumstances where, for \nexample, the State does not have jurisdiction or refuses to take \njurisdiction over the crime.\n  In June 2002, I voted in support of an amendment nearly identical to \nthe hate crimes legislation approved today. Then, and today, I \napproached the Senate leadership about adding to the legislation \nlanguage that would include age as a protected category, so that crimes \ndirected against the elderly and children could also be considered hate \ncrimes under this law. Defining age as an additional protected category \nin the law would also give State and local law enforcement officials \nnew tools to provide technical, forensic, prosecutorial, and other \nassistance beneficial to prosecuting hate crimes against the elderly \nand children.\n  Unfortunately, the managers of the hate crimes legislation declined \nto accept my suggestion of defining age as being an additional \nprotected category under the bill, but I pledge to continue to do all \nthat I can to make certain that the elderly and children are provided \nall protections possible to ensure their safety, and to make certain \nthat those who perpetrate hate crimes against them receive suitable \npunishment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/15/senate-section/article/S6775-3", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6775-S6776]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  NOMINATION OF VIRGINIA E.

Mr. President, I wonder if I could address the Senate \nwith regard to the schedule.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. We are making good progress on this bill. We have \nindications of at least four amendments that will be worked on, part \nthis evening and part in the early morning, that could result in three \nto four votes. We would like to lead off following the established time \nfor morning business, which I understand may be some 30 minutes, at \napproximately 10 o'clock with debate with the Senator from Connecticut, \nMr. Dodd, 15 minutes on each side, followed by a rollcall vote. That \nwould be followed thereafter by Senator Leahy. We are not certain \nexactly what time. That will require approximately 2 hours equally \ndivided. We have the Bunning amendment which will be brought up \ntomorrow. And tonight we will lay down an amendment by Senator Reed on \nend strength. We will start that amendment tonight. There are \ncolleagues on both sides who will want to address that tomorrow.\n  We will order this evening the final order of these amendments in \nsequence. If there is any other Senator desiring to move forward with \nan amendment tomorrow, I urge that Senator to address my colleague or \nmyself.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. It is my understanding that tonight, when we get to the \nbill, the junior Senator from Idaho is going to lay down an amendment; \nis that right?\n  Mr. WARNER. My understanding is he wishes to do that tomorrow where \nwe can get a unanimous consent.\n\n  Mr. REID. That is the best way to proceed.\n  Mr. WARNER. We recognize when the votes are concluded, Senator Reed \nwould lay down his amendment for discussion, we would then do cleared \namendments, and that will conclude the actions on this bill for today. \nWhen the leadership decides on the opening of the Senate tomorrow, we \nhave 30 minutes for morning business.\n  Mr. REID. We need half an hour on our side. I indicated to Senator \nLevin we would be happy to waive morning business on Thursday, but we \nwould like a half hour on our side tomorrow.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, if the Senator would yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. If you need 30 minutes in morning business, we would like \nit equally divided. Because we have such a full day tomorrow, I want to \nhave this first vote at 10 o'clock. We would be happy to come at 9 \no'clock in the morning, you take 30 minutes, or we will divide the hour \n30-30.\n  Mr. REID. That is totally appropriate.\n  I say through the Chair, on our side, Senator Durbin will offer the \nnext amendment, not Senator Reed. Our amendment will be Senator Durbin.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I understand that Senator Durbin, if he could, prefers to \nlay it down tomorrow, and Senator Reed can lay his amendment down.\n  Mr. WARNER. We have Senator Reed tonight. We will accommodate Senator \nDurbin tomorrow with 30 minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if I might ask the distinguished senior \nSenator from Virginia, as I understand it, my amendment is actually \npending. There are a number pending, but my understanding is the \ndistinguished Senator from Virginia will protect me for a block of \ntime.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. So we can debate and vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. Two hours equally divided at a time mutually agreeable, \nfollowed by a vote.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Good enough for me.\n  Mr. WARNER. We will incorporate this at the conclusion tonight in a \nUC. I thank the Presiding Officer, and I thank Members.\n  Senator Talent, also, will be recognized tonight to lay down his \namendment.

Without objection, the amendment is so \nmodified.\n  The amendment (No. 3313), as further modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 195, between lines 10 and 11, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 868. PROHIBITIONS ON USE OF CONTRACTORS FOR CERTAIN \n                   DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE ACTIVITIES.\n\n       (a) Prohibition on Use of Contractors in Interrogation of \n     Prisoners.--(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law \n     and except as provided in paragraph (2), the use of \n     contractors by the Department of Defense for the \n     interrogation of prisoners, detainees, or combatants at any \n     United States military installation or other installation \n     under the authority of United States military or civilian \n     personnel is prohibited.\n       (2)(A) During fiscal year 2005, the President may waive the \n     prohibition in paragraph (1) with respect to the use of \n     contractors to provide translator services under that \n     paragraph if the President determines that no United States \n     military personnel with appropriate language skills are \n     available to provide translator services for the \n     interrogation to which the waiver applies.\n       (B) The President may also waive the prohibition in \n     paragraph (1) with respect to any other use of contractors \n     otherwise prohibited by that paragraph during the 90-day \n     period beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act, \n     but any such waiver shall cease to be effective on the last \n     day of such period.\n       (3) The President shall, on a quarterly basis, submit to \n     the appropriate committees of Congress a report on the use, \n     if any, of contractors for the provision of translator \n     services pursuant to the waiver authority in paragraph \n     (2)(A).\n       (b) Prohibition on Use of Funds.--No funds authorized to be \n     appropriated by this Act or any other Act may be obligated or \n     expended for the utilization of contractor personnel in \n     contravention of the prohibition in subsection (a), whether \n     such funds are provided directly to a contractor by a \n     department, agency, or other entity of the United States \n     Government or indirectly through a permanent, interim, or \n     transitional foreign government or other third party.\n       (c) Prohibition on Transfer of Custody of Prisoners to \n     Contractors.--No prisoner, detainee, or combatant under the \n     custody or control of the Department of Defense may be \n     transferred to the custody or control of a contractor or \n     contractor personnel.\n       (d) Records of Transfers of Custody of Prisoners to Other \n     Countries.--(1) No prisoner, detainee, or combatant under the \n     custody or control of the Department of Defense may be \n     transferred to the custody or control of another department \n     or agency of the United States Government, a foreign, \n     multinational, or other non-United States entity, or another \n     country unless the Secretary makes an appropriate record of \n     such transfer that includes, for the prisoner, detainee, or \n     combatant concerned--\n       (A) the name and nationality; and\n       (B) the reason or reasons for such transfer.\n       (2) The Secretary shall ensure that--\n       (A) the records made of transfers by a transferring \n     authority as described in paragraph (1) are maintained by \n     that transferring authority in a central location; and\n       (B) the location and format of the records are such that \n     the records are readily accessible to, and readily viewable \n     by, the appropriate committees of Congress.\n       (3) A record under paragraph (1) shall be maintained in \n     unclassified form, but may include a classified annex.\n       (e) Review of United States Policy on Use of Contractors in \n     Combat Operations.--(1) Not later than 180 days after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense \n     shall submit to the appropriate committees of Congress a \n     report on the Secretary's review of United States policy on \n     the use of contractors in combat operations.\n       (2) The report under paragraph (1) shall identify and \n     review all current statutes, regulations, policy guidance, \n     and associated legal analyses relating to the use of \n     contractors by the Department of Defense, and by other \n     elements of the uniformed services, in routine engagements in \n     direct combat on the ground, including any prohibitions and \n     limitations on the use of contractors in such engagements.\n       (f) Appropriate Committees of Congress Defined.--In this \n     section, the term ``appropriate committees of Congress'' \n     means--\n       (1) the Committees on Armed Services, Foreign Relations, \n     and the Judiciary of the Senate and the Select Committee on \n     Intelligence of the Senate; and\n       (2) the Committees on Armed Services, International \n     Relations, and the Judiciary of\n\n[[Page S6778]]\n\n     the House of Representatives and the Permanent Select \n     Committee on Intelligence of the House of Representatives.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be added as \na cosponsor to Senator Dodd's modified amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Conrad \nbe added as a cosponsor to amendment No. 3192 which was adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                fairness in public-private competitions\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I commend Chairman Warner and Senator \nLevin for working with Senator Chambliss and me to reach a worthwhile \nbipartisan agreement on this amendment to produce greater fairness in \npublic-private competitions. We face great challenges on national \nsecurity and national defense in these times. We are doing all we can \nto meet the needs of our armed forces, and we are proud of their \nservice to our country. The Federal civilian employees of the \nDepartment of Defense deserve our strong support, too.\n  The rules put in place last May by the Office of Management and \nBudget to implement public-private competition reforms in the Federal \nGovernment, including the Department of Defense, are the most sweeping \nchanges in half a century. These rules have been controversial, and \nCongress has passed important protections over the last year to ensure \nthat competitions to privatize Federal work are fair.\n  Last year, in the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, a \nbipartisan Congress guaranteed Federal employees the opportunity to \ndemonstrate that they can do the work better and for a lower cost than \nprivate contractors. The fair competition amendment will make these \nprovisions permanent, guaranteeing the use of the most efficient \norganizations in both streamlined competitions and other A-76 \ncompetitions at the Department of Defense. The amendment also reduces \nthe incentive for private contractors to deny health benefits or \nprovide inadequate benefits. Forty-four million Americans are uninsured \ntoday, and the cost of health insurance premiums have soared by 43 \npercent over the last 3 years. Under this amendment, if contractors \noffer inferior health benefits, comparative savings in health costs \nwill not be counted in assessing their bids.\n  The amendment corrects a major defect in the OMB rules, which prevent \nFederal employees form competing effectively for a new work or work \nconducted by private contractors. The administration opposed a similar \namendment in the House that established a pilot program. This amendment \naddresses the administration's specific concerns about the pilot \nproject, while establishing a process for allowing and encouraging \nFederal employees to compete for new work and work currently performed \nby contractors.\n  The amendment also requires the inspector general to determine \nwhether the Department of Defense has the infrastructure necessary to \nconduct public-private competitions and administer service contracts.\n  This amendment deals primarily with competitions in the Department of \nDefense. We know there is also more work to be done with respect to \nother Federal agencies.\n  Given the importance of this issue to my colleagues and me, we will \nbe closely monitoring public-private competitions at the Department of \nDefense to ensure compliance with the current rules, to improve the \nlaw, and to pursue further legislative solutions to ensure fair \ncompetition. As we expand the Nation's military budget, we must see \nthat taxpayers and our men and women in uniform are obtaining all of \nthe benefits possible, and I hope very much that Chairman Warner and \nSenator Levin will retain this important amendment in the conference \nreport.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I appreciate the hard work of our chairman and ranking \nmember in working with Senator Kennedy and to approve the fair \ncompetition amendment.\n  The amendment addresses a number of issues about which I am very \nconcerned. One of the key issues is the ability of civilian employees \nto have the opportunity to compete for new work or work currently \nperformed by contractors. This amendment would encourage the Department \nof Defense to level the playing field in these areas, improve \nefficiency, and protect government employees' ability to perform \ncritical skills in key areas. And it does so in a way that addresses \nthe concerns expressed by the administration in its Statement of \nAdministration Policy.\n  Federal employees should compete in defense of their work, unless \nnational security dictates otherwise. Direct conversion, giving work \nperformed by Federal employees to contractors without competition, \ndisservices Federal employees and taxpayers. The OMB Circular A-76 \nallows for direct conversions with OMB's approval. But there is \nevidence that agencies may be undertaking direct conversions without \nOMB's approval. This amendment ensures that for DoD, the largest agency \nand the one that does the most contracting out, there will be no direct \nconversions of any functions performed by more than ten employees, \nabsent the invocation by the Secretary of Defense of a national \nsecurity waiver. We have also included strong language in the amendment \nto close loopholes by which DoD could break up functions so that they \ninvolve ten or fewer employees or arbitrarily designate the work as new \nin order to get around this requirement.\n\n  Federal employees required to undergo public-private competitions \nshould be able to submit their most competitive bids through the most \nefficient organization process. This amendment establishes such a \nrequirement for all functions performed by more than ten employees.\n  Due to the significant costs associated with conducting competitions, \ncontractors should be required to demonstrate that they will be \nmarginally more efficient than Federal employees before taking away \nwork performed by Federal employees. This amendment requires a minimum \ncost differential for all functions performed by more than ten \nemployees of 10 percent of $10 million, whichever is smaller.\n  Privatization reviews should be predicated on agencies' capacity to \nperform those reviews and then satisfactorily administer any resulting \nservice contracts. Our amendment ensures through its Inspector General \nreporting requirement that the Congress will know whether DoD has the \ncapacity to conduct the privatization reviews required of it by OMB \nover the next several years.\n  I am pleased that this amendment has been accepted by the Senate and \nlook forward to working with my colleagues during conference to include \nit in law.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I appreciate the willingness of my colleagues to work with \nthe Chairman and me on this amendment. The amendment addresses a number \nof important issues that face the Department of Defense's contracting \nout policies.\n  For the first time, this amendment would make permanent provisions \nthat require a most efficient organization and a minimum cost \ndifferential in almost all competitions. It ensures that contractors do \nnot have incentives to offer inferior health insurance packages as a \nway to cut costs and make their bids more appealing. And it sets up a \nprocess for Federal employees to gain opportunities to conduct new work \nand work performed by contractors.\n  The amendment would, on a government-wide basis, put Federal \nemployees and contractors on the same basis with respect to competing \nto perform new work. Contractors are not required to compete against \nFederal employees for new work, either under the FAR or A-76. The \namendment would eliminate the requirement in A-76 that forces Federal \nemployees to compete for new work or to retain their own work when the \nscope of that work expands.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Given that the one concern identified by OMB in its SAP \nhas been addressed in the amendment, would the Senator anticipate that \nthe amendment will be included in the conference report?\n\n[[Page S6779]]\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is my hope and expectation. I note that the House \nbill contains a similar provision, so the differences between the two \nprovisions will have to be worked out by the conferees. I commit to \nworking with my colleagues in the conference to ensure that the final \nlanguage in the conference report achieves the purposes of the \namendment.\n\n\ncommission on the future of the national technology and industrial base\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I would like to discuss section 841 of \nS. 2400, entitled the Commission on the Future of the National \nTechnology and Industrial Base.\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes. This Commission will examine our national technology \nand industrial base as it pertains to the national security of the \nUnited States. The Commission will make important recommendations to \nensure we maintain our technological leadership in a global economy.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I commend the chairman for his advocacy of this \nimportant issue. I would like to make the chairman aware of an effort \nthat has been underway at the National Academy of Sciences.\n  Mr. WARNER. Will the Senator please describe this effort to me?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Yes. For the past 12 years, the Board on Science \nTechnology and Economic Policy at the National Academies, has been \nevaluating the effects of globalization on key U.S. Industries such as \nbiotechnology, software, telecommunications, semiconductors, flat panel \ndisplays, lighting and heavy manufacturing industries such as steel. \nThe board produced a report in 2000 evaluating the effects of \nglobalization on a subset of these industries. They are now in the \nprocess of evaluating the effects of outsourcing and globalization \ntrends over the past 4 years on many of these same industries. Many, if \nnot all, of these industries are important to our defense industrial \nbase. I would like to ask the chairman if he believes it is important \nfor the Commission to review the work of Board on Science Technology \nand Economic Policy as it undertakes its research.\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes, I believe it is prudent that the Commission fully \nutilize the expertise that the Board on Science Technology and Economic \nPolicy has developed in evaluating the trends of globalization and \noutsourcing on the industries you have just discussed.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank the chairman for his time in this matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3251\n\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I have an amendment I wish to offer on \nbehalf of Mr. Bond and myself. It is at the desk. I ask it be called \nup. It is amendment No. 3251.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendments are \nset aside. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Talent], for himself and Mr. \n     Bond, proposes an amendment numbered 3251.\n\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of Congress on America's National World \n                             War I Museum)\n\n       At the end of subtitle G of title X, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1068. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON AMERICA'S NATIONAL WORLD WAR \n                   I MUSEUM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Liberty Memorial Museum in Kansas City, Missouri, \n     was built in 1926 in honor of those individuals who served in \n     World War I in defense of liberty and the Nation.\n       (2) The Liberty Memorial Association, a nonprofit \n     organization which originally built the Liberty Memorial \n     Museum, is responsible for the finances, operations, and \n     collections management of the Liberty Memorial Museum.\n       (3) The Liberty Memorial Museum is the only public museum \n     in the Nation that exists for the exclusive purpose of \n     interpreting the experiences of the United States and its \n     allies in the World War I years (1914-1918), both on the \n     battlefield and on the home front.\n       (4) The Liberty Memorial Museum project began after the \n     1918 Armistice through the efforts of a large-scale, grass-\n     roots civic and fundraising effort by the citizens and \n     veterans of the Kansas City metropolitan area. After the \n     conclusion of a national architectural design competition, \n     ground was broken in 1921, construction began in 1923, and \n     the Liberty Memorial Museum was opened to the public in 1926.\n       (5) In 1994, the Liberty Memorial Museum closed for a \n     massive restoration and expansion project. The restored \n     museum reopened to the public on Memorial Day, 2002, during a \n     gala rededication ceremony.\n       (6) Exhibits prepared for the original museum buildings \n     presaged the dramatic, underground expansion of core \n     exhibition gallery space, with over 30,000 square feet of new \n     interpretive and educational exhibits currently in \n     development. The new exhibits, along with an expanded \n     research library and archives, will more fully utilize the \n     many thousands of historical objects, books, maps, posters, \n     photographs, diaries, letters, and reminiscences of World War \n     I participants that are preserved for posterity in the \n     Liberty Memorial Museum's collections. The new core \n     exhibition is scheduled to open on Veterans Day, 2006.\n       (7) The City of Kansas City, the State of Missouri, and \n     thousands of private donors and philanthropic foundations \n     have contributed millions of dollars to build and later to \n     restore this national treasure. The Liberty Memorial Museum \n     continues to receive the strong support of residents from the \n     States of Missouri and Kansas and across the Nation.\n       (8) Since the restoration and rededication of 2002, the \n     Liberty Memorial Museum has attracted thousands of visitors \n     from across the United States and many foreign countries.\n       (9) There remains a need to preserve in a museum setting \n     evidence of the honor, courage, patriotism, and sacrifice of \n     those Americans who offered their services and who gave their \n     lives in defense of liberty during World War I, evidence of \n     the roles of women and African Americans during World War I, \n     and evidence of other relevant subjects.\n       (10) The Liberty Memorial Museum seeks to educate a diverse \n     group of audiences through its comprehensive collection of \n     historical materials, emphasizing eyewitness accounts of the \n     participants on the battlefield and the home front and the \n     impact of World War I on individuals, then and now. The \n     Liberty Memorial Museum continues to actively acquire and \n     preserve such materials.\n       (11) A great opportunity exists to use the invaluable \n     resources of the Liberty Memorial Museum to teach the \n     ``Lessons of Liberty'' to the Nation's schoolchildren through \n     on-site visits, classroom curriculum development, distance \n     learning, and other educational initiatives.\n       (12) The Liberty Memorial Museum should always be the \n     Nation's museum of the national experience in the World War I \n     years (1914-1918), where people go to learn about this \n     critical period and where the Nation's history of this \n     monumental struggle will be preserved so that generations of \n     the 21st century may understand the role played by the United \n     States in the preservation and advancement of democracy, \n     freedom, and liberty in the early 20th century.\n       (13) This initiative to recognize and preserve the history \n     of the Nation's sacrifices in World War I will take on added \n     significance as the Nation approaches the centennial \n     observance of this event.\n       (14) It is fitting and proper to refer to the Liberty \n     Memorial Museum as ``America's National World War I Museum''.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--Congress--\n       (1) recognizes the Liberty Memorial Museum in Kansas City, \n     Missouri, including the museum's future and expanded \n     exhibits, collections, library, archives, and educational \n     programs, as ``America's National World War I Museum'';\n       (2) recognizes that the continuing collection, \n     preservation, and interpretation of the historical objects \n     and other historical materials held by the Liberty Memorial \n     Museum enhance the knowledge and understanding of the \n     Nation's people of the American and allied experience during \n     the World War I years (1914-1918), both on the battlefield \n     and on the home front;\n       (3) commends the ongoing development and visibility of \n     ``Lessons of Liberty'' educational outreach programs for \n     teachers and students throughout the Nation; and\n       (4) encourages the need for present generations to \n     understand the magnitude of World War I, how it shaped the \n     Nation, other countries, and later world events, and how the \n     sacrifices made then helped preserve liberty, democracy, and \n     other founding principles for generations to come.\n\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I rise today in support of an amendment to \ndesignate the Liberty Memorial Museum in Kansas City, MO, as America's \nWorld War I Museum. All of us in Missouri are privileged to have such \nan outstanding museum and memorial to honor those who served during \nthis critical period in our Nation's history.\n  World War I is, of course, an important part of America's history, \nand its history ought to be preserved so the generations of the 21st \ncentury can understand the role played by the United States in the \npreservation and advancement of freedom during that crucial time.\n  The Liberty Memorial Museum is the only public museum in the Nation \nthat exists for the exclusive purpose of interpreting the experiences \nof the United States and its Allies in the\n\n[[Page S6780]]\n\nWorld War I years, both on the battlefield and on the homefront. It \ndeserves this designation as America's National World War I Museum.\n  The museum has a truly amazing history. After the guns were silenced \nin 1918 and the huge celebrations died down, concerned citizens in the \nUnited States reflected on the war and the losses sustained. The \nLiberty Memorial Museum project began after the 1918 armistice through \nthe efforts of a large-scale, grassroots civic and fundraising effort \nby the citizens and veterans in the Kansas City metropolitan area. In \nless than 2 weeks, $2.5 million was raised through donations from local \ncitizens. That was in 1918. That gives the Senate some idea of the \nenormity of the efforts on behalf of this memorial.\n  After the conclusion of a national architectural design competition, \nground was broken in 1921, construction began in 1923, and the Liberty \nMemorial Museum was open to the public in 1926.\n  At the dedication on November 1, 1921, the main Allied military \nleaders spoke to a crowd of close to 200,000 people.\n  It was the only time in history the leaders of the United States, \nBelgium, Italy, France, and Great Britain were together at one place. \nThese were the military leaders during World War I and they convened in \nKansas City in 1921 to open this museum.\n  Today, the Liberty Memorial Museum seeks to educate a diverse group \nof audiences through its comprehensive collection of historical \nmaterials, emphasizing eyewitness accounts of the participants on the \nbattlefield and the homefront and the impact of World War I on \nindividuals, then and now. The Liberty Memorial Museum continues to \nactively acquire and preserve such materials.\n  The designation of the museum as ``America's National World War I \nMuseum'' is a great opportunity to use the invaluable resources of the \nLiberty Memorial Museum to teach the lessons of liberty to the Nation's \nschoolchildren through onsite visits, classroom curriculum development, \ndistance learning, and other educational initiatives.\n  I am pleased to offer the amendment on behalf of Mr. Bond and myself. \nI want to thank the chairman and the ranking member for agreeing to \ninclude the measure in the underlying bill. It has been cleared on both \nsides and I look forward to the Senate adding it to this Defense \nmeasure.\n  I yield the floor, and I ask for adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the amendment is cleared on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to amendment No. 3251.\n  The amendment (No. 3251) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3352\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I have an amendment numbered 3352.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendments are \nset aside and the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Reed], for himself, Mr. \n     Hagel, Mr. McCain, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Akaka and Mr. Biden \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3352.\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To increase the end strength for active duty personnel of the \n            Army for fiscal year 2005 by 20,000 to 502,400)\n\n       On page 59, line 7, strike ``482,400'' and insert \n     ``502,400''.\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, it is my intention this evening to spend a \nfew minutes to lay the amendment down and then I presume at the end of \nthe evening, with unanimous consent, I will be given at least an hour \nof debate tomorrow which I will share with Senators McCain, Hagel, and \nothers. That is my understanding. I ask the Senator from Virginia if \nthat understanding is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we will work that out along those lines.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I understand from the chairman that he will \noffer a second-degree amendment at the appropriate time. At this \njuncture, I would like to briefly explain the amendment and then have \nthe opportunity to discuss it in more detail tomorrow with my \ncolleague.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I understand it is in order to forward a \nsecond-degree amendment to the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island has the floor.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3450 to Amendment No. 3352\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I send a second-degree amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3450 to amendment No. 3352.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide for funding the increased number of Army active-\n      duty personnel out of fiscal year 2005 supplemental funding)\n\n       Strike line 2 and insert the following:\n     ``502,400, subject to the condition that the costs of active \n     duty personnel of the Army in excess of 482,400 shall be paid \n     out of funds authorized to be appropriated for fiscal year \n     2005 for a contingent emergency reserve fund or as an \n     emergency supplemental appropriation''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. My amendment will increase the end strength of the Army to \nmeet the incredible mission that has been thrust upon them in the wake \nof the war on terror and the operations in Afghanistan and the \noperations in Iraq. I believe it is incumbent that we formally increase \nthe end strength of the Army and we incorporate within the Army budget \nthe requirements for these additional soldiers.\n  At this juncture, the Army is being increased on an emergency basis \nthrough supplemental appropriations. I think that is not the \nappropriate way to do it. I think we have to recognize that the \nstruggles we are engaged in are long term; they are not temporary. We \nhave to have an end strength within the authorization bill that \nreflects that long-term effort we are engaged in.\n  I also believe we have to have within the Army budget the baseline \nestablished so that if a supplemental is delayed or is not sufficient \nto cover these additional troops, the Army does not have to go among \nits own programs and root about and find moneys to pay for these \ntroops.\n  These troops are necessary. It is expedient that we should in fact \nengage and correct this discrepancy between the missions and the men \nand women who are serving our Army so well.\n  This is a quick glimpse of our soldiers who are committed throughout \nthe world: 310,000 soldiers in 120 countries. The most significant, of \ncourse, are operations in Afghanistan and in Iraq. There are 13,000 in \nAfghanistan and 126,000 in Iraq. There are soldiers all across the \nglobe and I think we all understand the stresses of these operations \nare wearing our Army down rapidly.\n  Some of the indications that we have too few troops can be cited very \nquickly. First, literally a few days ago the Army announced a stop-loss \npolicy that would prevent soldiers from leaving the Army 90 days before \ntheir unit deploys into Iraq. We are essentially telling volunteers \nthat they cannot leave at the end of their enlistment. That is an \nobvious indication we have too few troops.\n  Second, we are withdrawing troops from Korea. There might be \nstrategic reasons to pull troops out of Korea. There might be \nlogistical reasons. Technology might be aiding them. But, frankly, this \nis an indication of, again, the shortage of troops within the Army, \nbecause we have huge risks in North Korea. This is a regime that has \nannounced they have nuclear weapons. This is a regime that has been \ninvolved in on-and-off negotiations with us for a matter of many months \nto see if we can resolve the situation peacefully.\n  The signal we are sending to the North Koreans, albeit unwittingly, \nis this is not a major priority; we are actually taking troops away.\n  When troops are taken away, we may still have the ability to deter \nthe North Koreans from attacking South Korea but, frankly, our mission \nover there is no longer just deterrence, it is disarmament, and that \nrequires diplomacy backed up by force. We hope diplomacy works, but we \nare weakening our hand.\n  One of the most interesting and insightful indications of the \nshortage of\n\n[[Page S6781]]\n\ntroops is we are actually beginning to take apart the training \ninfrastructure of the U.S. Army. Recently it was announced that troops \nfrom our training centers, the 11th Army Cavalry Regiment, which serves \nas the op force, the enemy force, in training our units, is being \nnotified for deployment overseas. In addition to that, the 1st \nBattalion of the 509th Infantry, which acts as the opposition force to \ntrain our troops at Fort Polk, LA, is also on notice.\n\n  What can be more demonstrative of the shortage of troops than the \nfact we are, in a sense, dismantling our training structure? That in \nthe long term is going to do great harm to the service. We need more \ntroops.\n  I am sure those who are opposed to the amendment will say we have \nauthorized in this bill again access to emergency authorization and \nsupplemental funding, but that is not doing it the right way, doing it \nup front, doing it in a straightforward manner, increasing end strength \nstatutorily, and putting this into the regular budget process.\n  I hope tomorrow we can debate this bill. I am unaware of the second-\ndegree amendment. I will get with the chairman to see what his language \nis. I feel very strongly that this is the way to do it, and I am joined \nin that by my colleagues Senators McCain, Hagel, Corzine, Akaka, Biden, \nand many others who feel very strongly this is the way to do it and it \nshould be done. I hope it will be done tomorrow.\n  With the expectation and the understanding that we will have at least \nan hour tomorrow on my side to engage in debate on this issue, at this \npoint I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I say to my good friend from Rhode Island \nthat this has been an issue he has expressed concern about for better \nthan a year or more in the course of our hearings in the Armed Services \nCommittee, where my colleague is a very valuable member. He also draws \non his own experience as a distinguished West Point graduate and Army \nofficer himself. He speaks against a background of experience and \nknowledge.\n  Yes, the bill at the moment has a provision in it which gives the \nflexibility to the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Army, and \nothers to increase on a temporary basis--actually we go up to 30,000 if \nthey need it, whereas the Senator from Rhode Island does 20,000. We \nwill work this out tomorrow. But I express two concerns tonight, as we \nlay down the preliminary record. I pose this question to the Senator \nfrom Rhode Island. You do not provide in your amendment any means by \nwhich to pay for it; am I not correct?\n\n  Mr. REED. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. Then my next question would be, you know from your \nexperience on the committee that the Department of the Army primarily--\nit could be it comes from other areas of the defense budget, but the \nDepartment of the Army might have to get over $2 billion out of its \ncurrent budget to meet these added costs. Would that not be correct?\n  Mr. REED. If I may respond to the chairman, he is quite right about \nthe offset. I have some ideas from where the money could come. It is my \nfeeling it should come from funds outside the Army. I think what we \nhave done is we have increased it, but we haven't offset it by Army \nprograms. So there is the possibility--I hope the likelihood--the \noffset would come from other programs.\n  Mr. WARNER. As I think the Senator will see--I think I have sent a \ncopy of my amendment over to him. It is very brief. It just specifies \nthat the funding will come from areas other than the Department of the \nArmy budget or elsewhere in the defense budget. Has the Senator had an \nopportunity to look at the amendment?\n  Mr. REED. I have had an opportunity to read the amendment. It seems, \nin keeping with the Senator's commitment to be constructive and \nhelpful, to be very constructive and very helpful, on first \nexamination.\n  Mr. WARNER. We will work on this tomorrow. But I think for the \npurposes of tomorrow's debate, we framed the parameters in which the \ndebate is likely to occur. I am optimistic that we can work this out \ntogether. I commend the Senator. He has been a lead, with Senator \nMcCain and others, from the very beginning.\n  At this point in time, the leadership, tonight, in consultation with \nSenator Levin and myself, will work out the sequence of events \ntomorrow. The Senator believes he needs a full hour on his side?\n  Mr. REED. Yes. Myself, Senator Hagel, and Senator McCain wish to \nspeak.\n  Mr. WARNER. Fine. I will indicate to the leadership I will not need a \nfull hour to speak to the second-degree amendment and to my concern \nabout the permanency of it. But the reality is I think this will move \ntomorrow. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, I see the distinguished Senator from Illinois seeking \nrecognition. It is my hope and expectation we can work this matter out. \nHow much does he wish to address it tonight?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I say to the chairman, who I respect so \nmuch, I agree tomorrow we will take 30 minutes equally divided before \nthe vote on this amendment. My hope this evening is, in the span of \nperhaps 20 minutes, to give a longer statement so it will not be \nnecessary to repeat it tomorrow and save us some time so we can move \nmore quickly. I know the Senator has been extremely patient.\n  Mr. WARNER. We have all been patient. I thank the Senator. I think \nthat is very helpful. If the Senator will proceed along those lines, I \nwill be working on the finalization of the unanimous consent request to \nput in tomorrow. At the conclusion of the Senator's remarks, this \namendment will just be among the pending amendments?\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. We may be able to work it out tomorrow such that we do \nnot require a recorded vote.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I might say to the chairman, because of the serious \nnature of this amendment, I think we will want a recorded vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is the Senator's prerogative.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I hope we can work on this tomorrow, and I will confer \nwith the chairman on that aspect.\n  I come to the floor today to offer amendment to the Defense \nDepartment authorization bill.\n  The amendment would reaffirm a very important, long-standing position \nof our nation: that the United States shall not engage in torture or \ncruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. This is a standard that is \nembodied in the U.S. Constitution and in numerous international \nagreements which the United States has ratified.\n  The amendment would require the Defense Secretary to issue guidelines \nto ensure compliance with this standard and to provide these guidelines \nto Congress. The Defense Secretary would also be required to report to \nCongress on any suspected violations of the prohibition on torture or \ncruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. The amendment specifically \nprovides that this information should be provided to Congress in a \nmanner and form that would protect national security.\n  Let me also explain what this amendment would not do. It would not \nimpose any new legal obligations on the United States. It would not \nlimit our ability to use the full range of interrogation techniques \nthat are outlined in the Army interrogation manual. It would not affect \nthe status of any person under the Geneva Conventions or whether any \nperson is entitled to the protections of the Geneva Conventions.\n  It would only reaffirm and ensure compliance with our long-standing \nobligation not to subject detainees to torture or cruel, inhuman and \ndegrading treatment.\n  The amendment is supported by a broad coalition of organizations and \nindividuals, including human rights organizations like Human Rights \nWatch and Amnesty International, religious institutions such as the \nEpiscopal Church, and military officers, such as retired Rear Admiral \nJohn Hutson.\n  Admiral Hutson was a Navy Judge Advocate for 28 years and from 1997-\n2000, he was the Judge Advocate General, the top lawyer in the Navy. In \na letter in support of this amendment, he wrote:\n\n       It is absolutely necessary that the United States maintain \n     the high ground in this area and that Congress take a firm \n     stand on the issue. . . . It is critical that we remain \n     steadfast in our absolute opposition to torture and [cruel, \n     inhuman or degrading treatment]. Senator Durbin's proposed \n     amendment is a critical first step in that regard.\n\n\n[[Page S6782]]\n\n\n  In the aftermath of 9/11, some have called for the United States to \nabandon this commitment. But President Bush has made it clear that he \ndoes not support this position. On June 26, 2003, the International Day \nin Support of Victims of Torture, the President said:\n\n       The United States is committed to the world-wide \n     elimination of torture and we are leading this fight by \n     example. I call on all governments to join with the United \n     States and the community of law-abiding nations in \n     prohibiting, investigating, and prosecuting all acts of \n     torture and in undertaking to prevent other cruel and unusual \n     punishment.\n\n  I commend the President for standing behind our treaty obligations. \nNow the Congress must do no less. The world is watching us. They are \nasking whether the United States will stand behind its treaty \nobligations in the age of terrorism. With American troops in harm's \nway, we need to tell the world and the American people that the United \nStates is committed to treating all detainees humanely.\n  As we mourn the passing of President Ronald Reagan, we should recall \nhis vision of America as a shining city upon a hill--a model of \ndemocracy, freedom and the rule of law that people around the world \nlook to for inspiration. As President Reagan said in his Farewell \nAddress to the Nation:\n\n       After 200 years, two centuries, [America] still stands \n     strong and true on the granite ridge, and her glow has held \n     steady no matter what storm. And she's still a beacon, still \n     a magnet for all who must have freedom.\n\n  President Reagan was right. Our city upon a hill must hold steady in \ndefense of our principles no matter what storm. Despite the threat of \nterrorism, we must stand by our opposition to torture and other cruel \ntreatment.\n  In fact, it was President Reagan who first transmitted the Convention \nagainst Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or \nPunishment to the Senate with his recommendation that the Senate ratify \nthe treaty.\n  We are in the process of defining our values as a country in the age \nof terrorism. We need to make it clear that we will not compromise \nprinciples that have guided us and other civilized nations for hundreds \nof years.\n  The prohibition on torture and other cruel treatment is deeply rooted \nin our history. In 15th and 16th Century England, the infamous Star \nChamber issued warrants authorizing the use of torture against \npolitical opponents of the Crown. Supporters of the Star Chamber \nclaimed that torture was necessary to protect the security of the \nstate. Blackstone, the English jurist who greatly influenced the \nFounding Fathers, said: ``It seems astonishing that this usage of \ntorture should be said to arise from a tenderness to the lives of \nmen.'' Those words still ring true today.\n  In 1641, the Star Chamber was abolished and the use of torture \nwarrants ended. A prohibition on torture and cruel treatment developed \nin English common law. The English Bill of Rights of 1689, which served \nas a model for our Bill of Rights, contained a ban on ``cruel and \nunusual punishments.''\n  This history carried great weight with the Framers of our \nConstitution. During the Constitutional Conventions, Patrick Henry, in \na statement that typified the Founders' views, said: ``What has \ndistinguished our ancestors? That they would not admit of tortures, or \ncruel and barbarous punishment.''\n  During the Constitutional Convention, George Mason, who is known as \n``the Father of the Bill of Rights,'' explained that the 5th Amendment \nban on self-incrimination and the 8th Amendment ban of cruel and \nunusual punishment both prohibit torture and cruel treatment.\n  Our history makes clear that these principles also guided us during \ntimes of war. During the Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln asked \nFrancis Lieber, a military law expert, to create a set of rules to \ngovern the conduct of U.S. soldiers in the field. The Lieber Code \nprohibited torture or other cruel treatment of captured enemy forces. \nIt became the foundation for the modern law of war, which is embodied \nin the Geneva Conventions.\n  In the early twentieth century, the emergence of large police \ndepartments in the United States was accompanied by a dramatic increase \nin the abuse of suspects in police custody. President Hoover appointed \nthe National Commission on Law Observance and Enforcement, also known \nas the Wickersham Commission, to review law enforcement practices. In \n1931, the Commission's findings shocked the nation and permanently \ntransformed the nature of American law enforcement.\n  The Commission concluded:\n\n       The third degree is the employment of methods which inflict \n     suffering, physical or mental, upon a person, in order to \n     obtain from that person information about a crime. . . . The \n     third degree is widespread. The third degree is a secret and \n     illegal practice. When all allowances are made it remains \n     beyond a doubt that the practice is shocking in its character \n     and extent, violative of American traditions and \n     institutions, and not to be tolerated.\n\n  The commission catalogued and condemned ``third degree'' methods, \nincluding, physical brutality, threats, sleep deprivation, exposure to \nextreme cold or heat--also known as ``the sweat box''--and blinding \nwith powerful lights and other forms of sensory overload or \ndeprivation.\n  The commission also discussed practical reasons to reject the ``third \ndegree'':\n\n       The third degree involves the danger of false confessions. \n     . . so many instances have been brought to our attention \n     during this investigation that we feel convinced not only of \n     its existence but of its seriousness.\n       The third degree impairs police efficiency. . . . It tends \n     to make [police] less zealous in the search of objective \n     evidence.\n       The third degree brutalizes the police, hardens the \n     prisoner against society, and lowers the esteem in which the \n     administration of justice is held by the public. Probably the \n     third degree has been a chief factor in bringing about the \n     present attitude of hostility on the part of a considerable \n     portion of the population toward the police and the very \n     general failure of a large element of the people to aid or \n     cooperate with the police in maintaining law and order.\n       Over the next two decades, numerous Supreme Court opinions \n     cited the Wickersham Commission report and condemned the use \n     of various third degree methods as unconstitutional.\n       As the landscape of American policing was being reshaped, \n     the horrific abuses of Nazi Germany began to come to light. \n     This reinforced American opposition to torture and other \n     forms of cruel treatment.\n       One of the counts in the Nuremberg indictment of Gestapo \n     officials detailed official orders approving the application \n     of ``third degree'' techniques, including ``[a] very simple \n     diet (bread and water)[,] hard bunk[,] dark cell[,] \n     deprivation of sleep[,] exhaustive drilling[,] . . . [and] \n     flogging (for more than 29 strokes a doctor must be \n     consulted)'' as a means of obtaining evidence, or \n     ``information of important facts'' regarding subversion. One \n     of the defenses raised by Gestapo officers was that such \n     actions were necessary to protect against Resistance \n     terrorism.\n\n  After World War II, in the aftermath of Nuremberg and the disclosure \nof Nazi Gestapo tactics, the United States and our allies created a new \ninternational legal order based on respect for human rights.\n  One of its fundamental tenets was a universal prohibition on torture \nand cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment. The United States took the \nlead in establishing a succession of international agreements that ban \nthe use of torture and other cruel treatment against all persons at all \ntimes. There are no exceptions to this prohibition.\n  Eleanor Roosevelt was the Chair of the U.N. Commission that produced \nthe Universal Declaration on Human Rights in 1948. The Universal \nDeclaration states unequivocally, ``No one shall be subjected to \ntorture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.''\n  The United States, along with a majority of countries in the world, \nis a party to the Geneva Conventions, the International Covenant on \nCivil and Political Rights, and the Convention against Torture and \nOther Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, all of which \nprohibit torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment.\n  Army regulations that implement these treaty obligations state:\n\n       Inhumane treatment is a serious and punishable violation \n     under international law and the Uniform Code of Military \n     Justice (UCMJ). All prisoners will receive humane treatment \n     without regard to race, nationality, religion, political \n     opinion, sex, or other criteria. The following acts are \n     prohibited: murder, torture, corporal punishment, mutilation, \n     the taking of hostages, sensory deprivation, collective \n     punishments, execution without trial by proper authority, and \n     all cruel and degrading treatment. All persons will be \n     respected as human beings. They will be protected against all \n     acts of violence to include rape, forced prostitution, \n     assault and theft, insults, public curiosity, bodily injury, \n     and reprisals of any kind This list is not exclusive.\n\n\n[[Page S6783]]\n\n\n  Some people may be asking, ``What is, `cruel, inhuman or degrading \ntreatment.' '' How can the United States be bound by such an uncertain \nstandard?\n  The United States Senate debated this question before ratifying the \nInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Torture \nConvention. In response to this concern, we filed reservations to both \nof these agreements. A reservation is a statement filed by the Senate \nthat clarifies our obligations under international agreements.\n  These reservations state that the United States is bound to prevent \n``cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment'' only to the extent that that \nphrase means the cruel, unusual and inhumane treatment or punishment \nprohibited by the U.S. Constitution. In other words, ``cruel, inhuman \nor degrading treatment'' is defined by the U.S. Constitution, and the \nUnited States is only prohibited from engaging in conduct that is \nalready unconstitutional.\n  This provides certainty and clarity. In 1990, the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee held a hearing on the Torture Convention and an \nofficial from the first Bush administration explained the reservation:\n\n       We have proposed this reservation because the terms \n     ``cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment'' used \n     in this Convention are vague and are not evolved concepts \n     under international law. . . . On the other hand, the concept \n     of cruel and unusual punishment under the United States \n     Constitution is well developed, having evolved through court \n     decisions over a period of 200 years.\n\n  The current administration has confirmed that it stands by this \nreservation. Last year, Defense Department General Counsel William \nHaynes said:\n\n       ``[C]ruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment'' \n     means the cruel, unusual and inhumane treatment or punishment \n     prohibited by the Fifth, Eighth, and/or Fourteenth Amendments \n     to the Constitution of the United States. United States \n     policy is to treat all detainees and conduct all \n     interrogations, wherever they may occur, in a manner \n     consistent with this commitment.\n\n  Aside from our legal obligations, there are also important practical \nreasons for standing by our commitment not to engage in torture or \nother cruel treatment.\n  Torture is an ineffective interrogation tactic because it produces \nunreliable information. People who are being tortured will often lie to \ntheir torturer in order to stop the pain.\n  Resorting to torture and ill treatment of detainees would make us \nless secure, not more. It would create anti-American sentiment at a \ntime when we need the support and assistance of other countries in the \nwar on terrorism.\n  Finally, and most importantly, if we were to engage in torture or ill \ntreatment of detainees, we would increase the risk of subjecting \nmembers of the Armed Forces to torture if they are captured by our \nenemies.\n  The U.S. Army fully recognizes these practical downsides. The Army \nField Manual on Intelligence Interrogation states:\n\n       Use of torture and other illegal methods is a poor \n     technique that yields unreliable results, may damage \n     subsequent collection efforts, and can induce the source to \n     say what he thinks the interrogator wants to hear. Revelation \n     of use of torture by U.S. personnel will bring discredit upon \n     the U.S. and its armed forces while undermining domestic and \n     international support for the war effort. It may also place \n     U.S. and allied personnel in enemy hands at a greater risk of \n     abuse by their captors.\n\n  As the great American patriot Thomas Paine said: ``He that would make \nhis own liberty secure must guard even his enemy from oppression.''\n  Sadly, the ``third degree,'' which was condemned by the Wickersham \nCommission in 1931 and in subsequent Supreme Court decisions, has \nreemerged in modern times with a new name: ``stress and duress.'' \n``Stress and duress'' tactics, which are also known as ``torture \nlite,'' include extended food, sleep, sensory, or water deprivation, \nexposure to extreme heat or cold, and ``position abuse,'' which \ninvolves forcing detainees to assume positions designed to cause pain \nor humiliation. ``Stress and duress'' tactics clearly constitute \ntorture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment.\n  As the Supreme Court explained in Blackburn v. Alabama, a 1960 case:\n\n       [C]oercion can be mental as well as physical . . . the \n     blood of the accused is not the only hallmark of an \n     unconstitutional inquisition. A number of cases have \n     demonstrated, if demonstration were needed, that the \n     efficiency of the rack and the thumbscrew can be matched, \n     given the proper subject, by more sophisticated modes of \n     ``persuasion.''\n\n  Let's take one example: sleep deprivation. In Ashcraft v. Tennessee, \na 1944 case, the Supreme Court held that a confession obtained by \ndepriving a suspect of sleep and continuously questioning him for 36 \nhours was involuntarily coerced. For the majority, Justice Hugo Black \nwrote:\n\n       It has been known since 1500 at least that deprivation of \n     sleep is the most effective torture and certain to produce \n     any confession desired [quoting the Wickersham Commission]. . \n     . . We think a situation such as that here shown by \n     uncontradicted evidence is so inherently coercive that its \n     very existence is irreconcilable with the possession of \n     mental freedom by a lone suspect against whom its full \n     coercive force is brought to bear.\n\n  As explained in a recent New York Times article by Adam Hochschild, \nsleep deprivation was widely used in the Middle Ages on suspected \nwitches--it was called tormentum insomniae. Stalin's secret police \nsubjected prisoners to the ``conveyer belt,'' continuous questioning by \nnumerous interrogators until the prisoner signed a confession. Former \nIsraeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin wrote about his experience with \nsleep deprivation in a Soviet prison in the 1940's:\n\n       In the head of the interrogated prisoner a haze begins to \n     form. His spirit is wearied to death, his legs are unsteady, \n     and he has one sole desire: to sleep, to sleep just a little. \n     . . . Anyone who has experienced this desire knows that not \n     even hunger or thirst are comparable with it. . . . I came \n     across prisoners who signed what they were told to sign, only \n     to get what the interrogator promised them . . . \n     uninterrupted sleep!\n\n  Another example is ``position abuse.'' In 2002, in a case called Hope \nv. Pelzer, the Supreme Court addressed this issue. Hope, a prisoner, \nwas handcuffed to a ``hitching post'' for seven hours in the sun and \nnot allowed to use the bathroom. The Court held that this violated the \n8th Amendment prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. The Court \nsaid:\n\n       The obvious cruelty inherent in this practice should have \n     provided [the prison guards] with some notice that their \n     alleged conduct violated Hope's constitutional protection \n     against cruel and unusual punishment. Hope was treated in a \n     way antithetical to human dignity--he was hitched to a post \n     for an extended period of time in a position that was \n     painful, and under circumstances that were both degrading and \n     dangerous.\n\n  In the 1930s, Stalin's secret police forced dissidents to stand for \nprolonged periods to coerce confessions for show trials. In 1956, \nexperts commissioned by the CIA documented the effects of forced \nstanding. They found that ankles and feet swell to twice their normal \nsize within 24 hours, the heart rate increases, some people faint, and \nthe kidneys eventually shut down.\n  For many years, the United States has characterized the use of \n``stress and duress'' by other countries as ``Torture and Other Cruel, \nInhuman and Degrading Treatment.'' The State Department's ``Country \nReports on Human Rights Practices,'' which are submitted to Congress \nevery year, have condemned ``beatings,'' ``threats to detainees or \ntheir family members,'' ``sleep deprivation,'' ``depriv[ation] of food \nand water,'' ``suspension for long periods in contorted positions,'' \n``prolonged isolation,'' ``forced prolonged standing,'' ``tying of the \nhands and feet for extended periods of time,'' ``public humiliation,'' \n``sexual humiliation,'' and ``female detainees . . . being forced to \nstrip in front of male security officers.''\n  The Army Field Manual on Intelligence Interrogation characterizes \n``stress and duress'' as illegal physical and mental torture. The \nManual states that ``acts of violence or intimidation, including \nphysical or mental torture, threats, insults, or exposure to inhumane \ntreatment as a means of or an aid to interrogation'' are ``illegal.'' \nIt defines ``infliction of pain through . . . bondage (other than \nlegitimate use of restraints to prevent escape),'' ``forcing an \nindividual to stand, sit, or kneel in abnormal positions for prolonged \nperiods of time,'' ``food deprivation,'' and ``any form of beating,'' \nas ``physical torture'' and defines ``abnormal sleep deprivation'' as \n``mental torture'' and prohibits the use of these tactics under any \ncircumstances.\n  The Army Field Manual provides very specific guidance about \ninterrogation techniques that may approach the\n\n[[Page S6784]]\n\nline between lawful and unlawful actions. Before using a questionable \ninterrogation technique, an interrogator is directed to ask whether \n``If your contemplated actions were perpetrated by the enemy against \nU.S. [prisoners of war], you would believe such actions violate \ninternational or U.S. law. . . . If you answer yes . . . do not engage \nin the contemplated action.''\n  This is the Army's version of ``the golden rule''--do unto others as \nyou would have them do to you. It is an important reminder that the \nprohibition on torture and other cruel treatment protects American \nsoldiers as much as it does the enemy. If enemy forces used stress and \nduress tactics on American soldiers, we would condemn them. We must \nhold ourselves to the same standard.\n  The United States is not alone in condemning ``torture lite.'' In \nIsrael, a country that has grappled with terrorism for decades, the \nSupreme Court held that ``stress and duress'' techniques violate \ninternational law and are absolutely prohibited. As the Court \nexplained:\n\n       These prohibitions are ``absolute.'' There are no \n     exceptions to them and there is no room for balancing. Indeed \n     violence directed at a suspect's body or spirit does not \n     constitute a reasonable investigation practice.\n\n  For all of these reasons, it is vitally important that the Congress \naffirm the United States' commitment not to engage in torture or cruel, \ninhuman or degrading treatment.\n  Our commitment to principle, even during difficult times, has made \nAmerica a special country. In the age of terrorism, we may be tempted \nby the notion that torture is justified. But to sacrifice this \nprinciple would grant the terrorists a valuable victory at our expense.\n  The Israeli Supreme Court has explained:\n\n       Although a democracy must often fight with one hand tied \n     behind its back, it nonetheless has the upper hand. \n     Preserving the Rule of Law and recognition of an individual's \n     liberty constitutes an important component in its \n     understanding of security. At the end of the day, they \n     strengthen its spirit and allow it to overcome its \n     difficulties.\n\n  The brutal slaying of Nicholas Berg reminded us that our enemies do \nnot respect any rules in their relentless quest to kill Americans. But \nthat is what distinguishes us from the terrorists we fight. There are \nsome lines that we will not cross. Torture and cruel, inhuman or \ndegrading treatment are inconsistent with the principles of liberty and \nthe rule of law that underpin our democracy.\n  As President Reagan reminded us, our city upon a hill must stand \nfirm. The eyes of the world are upon us.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  It has been suggested to me by staff that perhaps I would offer the \namendment this evening and then ask unanimous consent it be set aside \nwhile we work things out with Chairman Warner and other Senators who \nare interested in this issue.\n  If there is no objection, with the understanding that I will not call \nup the amendment this evening and will wait until a decision from the \nchairman and the ranking member as to my place in line, I offer the \namendment and merely at this point ask it be reported by the clerk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3386\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I send to the desk amendment No. 3386.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois, [Mr. Durbin], proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3386.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To affirm that the United States may not engage in torture or \n         cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment)\n\n       At the end of subtitle F of title X, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1055. HUMANE TREATMENT OF DETAINEES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) After World War II, the United States and its allies \n     created a new international legal order based on respect for \n     human rights. One of its fundamental tenets was a universal \n     prohibition on torture and ill treatment.\n       (2) On June 26, 2003, the International Day in Support of \n     Victims of Torture, President George W. Bush stated, ``The \n     United States is committed to the world-wide elimination of \n     torture and we are leading this fight by example. I call on \n     all governments to join with the United States and the \n     community of law-abiding nations in prohibiting, \n     investigating, and prosecuting all acts of torture and in \n     undertaking to prevent other cruel and unusual punishment.''.\n       (3) The United States is a party to the Geneva Conventions, \n     which prohibit torture, cruel treatment, or outrages upon \n     personal dignity, in particular, humiliating and degrading \n     treatment, during armed conflict.\n       (4) The United States is a party to 2 treaties that \n     prohibit torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment \n     or punishment, as follows:\n       (A) The International Covenant on Civil and Political \n     Rights, done at New York December 16, 1966.\n       (B) The Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman \n     or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, done at New York \n     December 10, 1984.\n       (5) The United States filed reservations to the treaties \n     described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (4) \n     stating that the United States considers itself bound to \n     prevent ``cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or \n     punishment'' to the extent that phrase means the cruel, \n     unusual, and inhumane treatment or punishment prohibited by \n     the 5th amendment, 8th amendment, or 14th amendment to the \n     Constitution.\n       (6) Army Regulation 190-8 entitled ``Enemy Prisoners of \n     War, Retained Personnel, Civilian Internees and Other \n     Detainees'' provides that ``Inhumane treatment is a serious \n     and punishable violation under international law and the \n     Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). . . . All prisoners \n     will receive humane treatment without regard to race, \n     nationality, religion, political opinion, sex, or other \n     criteria. The following acts are prohibited: murder, torture, \n     corporal punishment, mutilation, the taking of hostages, \n     sensory deprivation, collective punishments, execution \n     without trial by proper authority, and all cruel and \n     degrading treatment. . . . All persons will be respected as \n     human beings. They will be protected against all acts of \n     violence to include rape, forced prostitution, assault and \n     theft, insults, public curiosity, bodily injury, and \n     reprisals of any kind. . . . This list is not exclusive.''.\n       (7) The Field Manual on Intelligence Interrogation of the \n     Department of the Army states that ``acts of violence or \n     intimidation, including physical or mental torture, threats, \n     insults, or exposure to inhumane treatment as a means of or \n     an aid to interrogation'' are ``illegal''. Such Manual \n     defines ``infliction of pain through . . . bondage (other \n     than legitimate use of restraints to prevent escape)'', \n     ``forcing an individual to stand, sit, or kneel in abnormal \n     positions for prolonged periods of time'', ``food \n     deprivation'', and ``any form of beating'' as ``physical \n     torture'', defines ``abnormal sleep deprivation'' as ``mental \n     torture'', and prohibits the use of such tactics under any \n     circumstances.\n       (8) The Field Manual on Intelligence Interrogation of the \n     Department of the Army states that ``Use of torture and other \n     illegal methods is a poor technique that yields unreliable \n     results, may damage subsequent collection efforts, and can \n     induce the source to say what he thinks the interrogator \n     wants to hear. Revelation of use of torture by U.S. personnel \n     will bring discredit upon the U.S. and its armed forces while \n     undermining domestic and international support for the war \n     effort. It may also place U.S. and allied personnel in enemy \n     hands at a greater risk of abuse by their captors.''.\n       (b) Prohibition on Torture or Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading \n     Treatment or Punishment.--(1) No person in the custody or \n     under the physical control of the United States shall be \n     subject to torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment \n     or punishment that is prohibited by the Constitution, laws, \n     or treaties of the United States.\n       (2) Nothing in this section shall affect the status of any \n     person under the Geneva Conventions or whether any person is \n     entitled to the protections of the Geneva Conventions.\n       (c) Rules, Regulations, and Guidelines.--(1) Not later than \n     180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the \n     Secretary shall prescribe the rules, regulations, or \n     guidelines necessary to ensure compliance with the \n     prohibition in subsection (b)(1) by the members of the United \n     States Armed Forces and by any person providing services to \n     the Department of Defense on a contract basis.\n       (2) The Secretary shall submit to the congressional defense \n     committees the rules, regulations, or guidelines prescribed \n     under paragraph (1), and any modifications to such rules, \n     regulations, or guidelines--\n       (A) not later than 30 days after the effective date of such \n     rules, regulations, guidelines, or modifications; and\n       (B) in a manner and form that will protect the national \n     security interests of the United States.\n       (d) Report to Congress.--(1) The Secretary shall submit, on \n     a timely basis and not less than twice each year, a report to \n     Congress on the circumstances surrounding any investigation \n     of a possible violation of the prohibition in subsection \n     (b)(1) by a member of the Armed Forces or by a person \n     providing services to the Department of Defense on a contract \n     basis.\n\n[[Page S6785]]\n\n       (2) A report required under paragraph (1) shall be \n     submitted in a manner and form that--\n       (A) will protect the national security interests of the \n     United States; and\n       (B) will not prejudice any prosecution of an individual \n     involved in, or responsible for, a violation of the \n     prohibition in subsection (b)(1).\n       (e) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) The term ``cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or \n     punishment'' means the cruel, unusual, and inhumane treatment \n     or punishment prohibited by the 5th amendment, 8th amendment, \n     or 14th amendment to the Constitution.\n       (2) The term ``Geneva Conventions'' means--\n       (A) the Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of \n     the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field, done at \n     Geneva August 12, 1949 (6 UST 3114);\n       (B) the Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of \n     the Wounded, Sick, and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at \n     Sea, done at Geneva August 12, 1949 (6 UST 3217);\n       (C) the Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners \n     of War, done at Geneva August 12, 1949 (6 UST 3316); and\n       (D) the Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian \n     Persons in Time of War, done at Geneva August 12, 1949 (6 UST \n     3516).\n       (3) The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of Defense.\n       (4) The term ``torture'' has the meaning given that term in \n     section 2340 of title 18, United States Code.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Would the Senator from Illinois clarify this?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I offered the amendment and asked unanimous consent that \nit be set aside pending a decision by the chairman and Senator Levin \nand other Senators.\n  Mr. WARNER. I wonder if the Senator might withhold until Senator \nReid, with whom I am working tonight, will give me some advice. What we \nwill be doing--Senator Reid could draw his up--we are going to \nincorporate this into the agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment has already been reported.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent the amendment be set aside until \nthere is an agreement between Senator Warner, Senator Levin, Senator \nReid, and others as to the time that it may be considered.\n  Mr. WARNER. I was under the understanding we would do it differently. \nI have not had a chance to discuss this with Senator Levin. I \nunderstood you were just going do speak to this and not propose it. \nWhat is done, is done.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I asked unanimous consent to set it aside, and it will \nnot be considered until you, Senator Warner, and Senator Levin say it \nis appropriate, whatever that time may be.\n  Mr. WARNER. What was the decision we made with respect to Senator \nReed?\n  We have to have some equality of how we are handling these things.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Reed amendment has been called up and is \nnow set aside by the Durbin amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. This amendment would then have the same status of being a \npending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thought by asking unanimous consent that it be set \naside, it would not in any way supersede any other Members' rights.\n  Mr. WARNER. We get so many gatekeeping amendments up here we could \nencounter difficulty tomorrow morning.\n  Mr. DURBIN. You have been so cooperative and helpful, I ask unanimous \nconsent that my amendment be withdrawn and I will offer it tomorrow. I \nwant to do whatever the chairman wishes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the distinguished Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Illinois is willing to have his amendment \nset aside. He is certainly not trying to take advantage of anyone. I \nthink it does not solve our problem if he withdraws his amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. I just want to treat--Senator Reed was here momentarily, \nand we worked with him. Anyway, I want to be fair to all Senators.\n  Mr. REID. We have a queue that is tentatively going to be set up to \nhandle all this tomorrow.\n  Mr. WARNER. We will work this out tonight, hopefully.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senator from Illinois has indicated--if I could just \nask whoever has the floor to yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield.\n  Mr. LEVIN. His amendment will be back in order when the chairman and \nranking member so designate it. He is not trying to use his amendment \nas a gatekeeper. Why don't we just leave it pending and then set it \naside?\n  Mr. WARNER. If he will withdraw it, we can include it in the \nunanimous consent tonight.\n  Mr. REID. We do not need to have him withdraw it.\n  Mr. WARNER. I beg your pardon?\n  Mr. REID. We do not need to have him withdraw it.\n  Mr. WARNER. Well, I am going to rely on your assurances.\n  Mr. REID. Because the Senator from Illinois has said he is not trying \nto take advantage of anyone, not trying to be a gatekeeper, that it is \nup to the two managers of the bill when the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Illinois is acted upon.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, may I suggest this. If I could have the \nchairman's attention, if we have a unanimous consent agreement that is \nentered into tonight, and if we include Senator Durbin's amendment in \nthat list, that would supersede whatever status that amendment has at \nthis point. Would that be agreeable to everyone?\n  Mr. WARNER. That is agreeable.\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is agreeable to me, as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am curious, having offered the \namendment, whether I need to make a unanimous consent request to make \nit clear what has been agreed upon?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No.\n  Mr. DURBIN. It appears it has become part of the legend and lore of \nthe Senate, and I cannot add anything to it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3167, As Modified\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Senator from Michigan and myself will \nnow proceed to do some cleared amendments. Domenici amendment No. 3167 \nwas inadvertently approved by the Senate yesterday without a \nmodification that was agreed to by both the majority and minority. I \nsend to the desk a modified amendment No. 3167, as agreed to, as a \nsubstitute for the original amendment and ask unanimous consent that it \nbe substituted for the version agreed to yesterday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3167), as modified, was agreed to, as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To require a report on the availability of potential overland \n                 ballistic missile defense test ranges)\n\n       At the end of subtitle C of title X, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1022. REPORT ON AVAILABILITY OF POTENTIAL OVERLAND \n                   BALLISTIC MISSILE DEFENSE TEST RANGES.\n\n       The Secretary of Defense shall submit to Congress a report \n     assessing the availability to the Department of Defense of \n     potential ballistic missile defense test ranges for overland \n     intercept flight tests of defenses against ballistic missile \n     systems with a range of 750 to 1,500 kilometers.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n Amendments Nos. 3395; 3392, As Modified; 3402, As Modified; 3346, As \nModified; 3326, As Modified; 3349, As Modified; and 3385, As Modified, \n                                En Bloc\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I send a package of amendments to the desk \nand ask that they be considered en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

DRUG ERADICATION EFFORTS IN AFGHANISTAN.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States engaged in military action against \n     the Taliban-controlled Government of Afghanistan in 2001 in \n     direct response to the Taliban's support and aid to Al Qaeda.\n       (2) The military action against the Taliban in Afghanistan \n     was designed, in part, to disrupt the activities of, and \n     financial support for, terrorists.\n       (3) A greater percentage of the world's opium supply is now \n     produced in Afghanistan than before the Taliban banned the \n     cultivation or trade of opium.\n       (4) In 2004, more than two years after the Taliban was \n     forcefully removed from power, Afghanistan is supplying \n     approximately 75 percent of the world's heroin.\n       (5) The estimated value of the opium harvested in \n     Afghanistan in 2003 was $2,300,000,000.\n       (6) Some of the profits associated with opium harvested in \n     Afghanistan continue to fund terrorists and terrorist \n     organizations, including Al Qaeda, that seek to attack the \n     United States and United States interests.\n       (7) The global war on terror is and should remain our \n     Nation's highest national security priority.\n       (8) United States and Coalition counterdrug efforts in \n     Afghanistan have not yet produced significant results.\n       (9) There are indications of strong, direct connections \n     between terrorism and drug trafficking.\n       (10) The elimination of this funding source is critical to \n     making significant progress in the global war on terror.\n       (11) The President of Afghanistan, Hamid Karzai, has stated \n     that opium production poses a significant threat to the \n     future of Afghanistan, and has established a plan of action \n     to deal with this threat.\n       (12) The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime has \n     reported that Afghanistan is at risk of again becoming a \n     failed state if strong actions are not taken against \n     narcotics.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the President should make the substantial reduction of \n     drug trafficking in Afghanistan a priority in the war on \n     terror;\n       (2) the Secretary of Defense should, in coordination with \n     the Secretary of State, work to a greater extent in \n     cooperation with the Government of Afghanistan and \n     international organizations involved in counterdrug \n     activities to assist in providing a secure environment for \n     counterdrug personnel in Afghanistan; and\n       (3) because the trafficking of narcotics is known to \n     support terrorist activities and contributes to the \n     instability of the Government of Afghanistan, additional \n     efforts should be made by the Armed Forces of the United \n     States, in conjunction with and in support of coalition \n     forces, to significantly reduce narcotics trafficking in \n     Afghanistan and neighboring countries, with particular focus \n     on those trafficking organizations with the closest links to \n     known terrorist organizations.\n       (c) Report.--Not later than 120 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall submit \n     to Congress a report that describes--\n       (1) progress made towards substantially reducing the poppy \n     cultivation and heroin production capabilities in \n     Afghanistan; and\n       (2) the extent to which profits from illegal drug activity \n     in Afghanistan fund terrorist organizations and support \n     groups that seek to undermine the Government of Afghanistan.\n\n\n                    amendment no. 3346, As modified\n\n   (Purpose: To reduce barriers for Hispanic-serving institutions in \n   defense contracts, defense research programs, and other minority-\n                       related defense programs)\n\n       At the end of subtitle G of title X, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1068.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n[[Page S6788]]\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by my \ncolleague Senator Feinstein in support of amendment No. 3402 to S. \n2400, the Department of Defense Reauthorization bill. We hope this \nresolution expressing Congress's expectations will encourage the \nDepartment to do more to address narcotics trafficking in Afghanistan.\n  This resolution calls upon the President to make the elimination of \ndrug trafficking in Afghanistan a priority in the global war on terror; \nencourages the Secretary of Defense to increase cooperation and \ncoordination with the Government of Afghanistan and our allies to \nassist in providing a secure environment for counterdrug personnel \noperating in Afghanistan; and calls upon the Armed Forces to work with \nour allies against the regional illicit narcotics trade.\n  These are not original observations. In testimony before both \ncommittees in both Chambers, several officials from the Department of \nDefense have affirmed that there is a strong, direct connection between \nterrorism and drug trafficking. We know from this testimony and other \nevidence that some of the profits generated by narcotics trafficking \nsupport terrorists.\n  This resolution is needed, because there is some inconsistency \nbetween the direction that we are providing to our troops in \nAfghanistan and the narco-terrorist connection. I do not believe that \nwe will see long-term success in the global war on terror until the \nfinancial underpinnings of terrorists are eliminated, and I do not \nbelieve that Afghanistan can avoid becoming a narco-state if the drug \ntrafficking there is not addressed. To avoid these potential pitfalls, \nwe must step up our counter-narcotics activities in Afghanistan. I hope \nthe administration, and particularly the Department of Defense, will \nheed this resolution.\n  Narcotic trafficking is not only a source of funding for terrorist \norganizations, but its production poses a threat to the future \nstability of Afghanistan. President Karzai has stated repeatedly that \nhe believes opium production poses a significant threat to the future \nof Afghanistan. His concerns are echoed by the United Nations Office on \nDrugs and Crime, which recently warned that Afghanistan is at risk of \nagain becoming a failed state if strong actions are not taken against \nnarcotics. If we are going to assist the people of Afghanistan in their \nefforts to create a stable country, we cannot ignore their pleas for \ngreater action against the narco-terrorists operating in the region.\n  Mr. President, I believe that our current policy in Afghanistan does \nnot square with these observations about the threat that narcotics pose \nto the future of Afghanistan. Attempts are being made to separate anti-\nterror operations from anti-drug operations, despite the acknowledged \nlink between the two. We know that drug trafficking is a war industry \nof terrorism. If we are going to be successful, we must eliminate the \nfinancial underpinnings of terrorism just as effectively as the \norganizations themselves.\n  Those who sell and trade opium in Afghanistan are narco-terrorists. \nThey support terrorists and insurgents who oppose the legitimate \ngovernment. By supporting terrorists and insurgents, they become \nlegitimate targets for the Combined Forces Command-Afghanistan. Just as \nball bearing factories in Nazi Germany were important military targets \nduring World War II, drug labs, and those who facilitate the drug \ntrade, should also be considered viable military targets as we \nprosecute the War on Terror.\n  I believe that the United States should treat narcotics traffickers \nno different than others suspected of cooperating with terrorists. The \nconnection is real, and cannot be ignored. I urge my colleagues to join \nus in supporting this resolution.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Grassley-\nFeinstein amendment, which calls upon the President to make the \ndecimation of the Afghanistan heroin trade one of his highest national \nsecurity priorities, asked the Defense Department to devote more time, \nenergy and resources to anti-drug efforts in Afghanistan, and asks for \na study into whether profits from the illegal drug trade continue to \nfund terrorists and others who upset the stability of that nation.\n  Afghanistan has long been the world's major supplier of heroin, \nproviding the global market as much as 80% of all the heroin consumed \neach year.\n  This is a grave problem--not just because heroin is a bad thing in \nand of itself, but because profits from the heroin trade in Afghanistan \nhave historically been funneled, in large part, to terrorists bent on \ndoing America harm or those that aid and protect those terrorists.\n  Indeed, it has been estimated that millions of dollars--even hundreds \nof millions of dollars--in drug profits have been funneled to al-Qaida \nand other terrorist organizations throughout the world. Those \norganizations, in turn, can use the money to run terrorist training \ncamps; to buy guns, bombs and other supplies; to recruit; and to fund \nterrorist operations throughout the world.\n  Needless to say, this is a major problem. If we continue to allow \nterrorist organizations to rake in hundreds of millions of untraceable \ndollars, the war on terror is going to go quite poorly for us indeed.\n  This is not the first time I have raised these concerns. Last May, \nfor instance, I expressed concern that this administration had made a \ndecision to allow warlords and others in Afghanistan to continue to \ngrow poppy and to produce opium, in the hopes of maintaining \nrelationships and alliances with those who were trafficking in drugs. \nIn other words, the administration was essentially turning a blind eye \nto drug production, in order to work more closely with those who were \nprofiting from it.\n  This was not acceptable then, and it remains unacceptable now. The \nvery reason we went to Afghanistan--to remove al-Qaida's means of \nsupport--will be lost if we continue to allow these drug lords to fund \nal-Qaida and those that hide them, protect them, fund them and help \nthem in other ways.\n  More than two years after we went into Afghanistan, we don't have bin \nLaden. We have not stopped the terrorist attacks. We do not control the \ncountryside in Afghanistan. And now we are standing by while the drug \ntrade flourishes beyond levels experienced even before 9/11.\n  I know this is not an easy problem to solve. Farmers in Afghanistan, \nlike in many other nation's involved in illegal drug production, often \nfind that growing poppy is far more profitable than the country's other \nstaples--cereals, wheat, barley, rice, and so on.\n  So combined with Afghanistan's foreboding terrain and chaotic \npolitical and security situation, it is not a simple matter to \neliminate drug production.\n  Many farmers survive either solely on poppy production or by growing \na mix of legal, and illegal crops.\n  There is hope--poppy production represents only about 8% of \nAfghanistan's crop production (in volume). So many farmers do grow \nalternate crops, and they make a living doing it.\n  But we need to make better efforts to provide farmers good \nalternatives; to deter production; and, most importantly, to eradicate \nthe crops on the ground.\n  Eradicating poppy is not easy--particularly in a nation where the \ncentral government has so little control over its distant--and even \nnot-so-distant--provinces.\n  Only with military assistance can anti-drug operatives go into an \narea and take out the poppy fields. Some of these warlords have virtual \narmies at their disposal--helicopters, rocket launchers, you name it. \nThis is not your local marijuana field in someone's backyard. This, \ntruly, is akin to war.\n  The war in Iraq has certainly hindered the Defense Department's \nability to assist in these operations--there is only so much manpower \nand equipment to go around. This is one reason why so many questioned \nthe advisability of going into Iraq before the job in Afghanistan was \nfinished.\n  But tough as it may be to solve, this issue is simply too important \nto ignore, and we cannot wait any longer.\n  Recent estimates put Afghanistan's poppy production this year at more \nthan 5,000 metric tons--more than 50 percent higher than last year.\n  Even if the most aggressive current efforts at eradication succeed in \nevery respect, only 25 percent of the crop this year will be destroyed.\n  This means that no matter what, more heroin will be produced this \nyear\n\n[[Page S6789]]\n\nthan last. The value of that heroin could easily exceed three billion \ndollars. Farmers only get about a penny on the dollar. Where is the \nrest of the money going? Best estimates are that much of it goes to \nterrorists or their protectors.\n  This simply cannot continue if we hope to win the war on terror. This \namendment calls upon the Defense Department to better assist in \nprotecting drug eradication efforts and to work to disrupt and destroy \nthose who aid terrorist activity through the drug trade.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the \nSenate resume the Defense authorization bill on Wednesday, there be 30 \nminutes equally divided for debate in relation to the Dodd amendment, \nNo. 3313, as further modified. I further ask that following that time, \nthe Senate proceed to a vote in relation to the amendment, with no \namendments in order to the amendment prior to the vote. I further ask \nthat following the disposition of the Dodd amendment, the Senator from \nVirginia, Mr. Warner, or his designee, be recognized to offer the next \nfirst-degree amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\ncommission on the future of the national technology and industrial base\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, as we are considering the National Defense \nAuthorization Act, I thank my colleagues, Senators Warner and Levin, \nthe Chairman and ranking Member of the Armed Services Committee, for so \ngraciously agreeing to accept an amendment that I and several of my \ncolleagues have proposed to modify Section 841 of that bill to enhance \nthe work of the new ``Commission on the Future of the National \nTechnology and Industrial Base,'' which is being established by this \nlegislation. This amendment is the result of collaboration between \nmyself and Senators Snowe and Kerry, Chairman and ranking Member of the \nCommittee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, as well as Senators \nAllen and Coleman.\n  First of all, our amendment will require this new Commission to \nconsider carefully the problem of current or potential shortages of \ncritical technologies in the United States. It will also require the \nCommission to examine the issue of existing or future shortages of the \nraw materials that are essential to the production of these \ntechnologies.\n  America's national security continues to be threatened by dwindling \nsupplies of U.S.-made components and raw materials. Our Nation's \nindustrial base can be expected to experience a decline in the \nproduction of certain technologies and the raw materials necessary to \ncreate them, as more and more small and medium-sized U.S. firms shift \ntheir production overseas. To the extent that these firms specialize in \nthe manufacture of unique components, or are ``sole source'' producers \nof materials needed to supply the U.S. defense industry, their \ndeparture from the U.S. market leaves manufacturers of America's \ncritical technologies with a dearth of reliable suppliers.\n  The amendment that my colleagues and I offer today requires the \nCommission to examine whether, and in which areas, the United States \nnow suffers, or might suffer in the future, shortages of critical \ntechnologies and their raw material inputs. The amendment also \naccelerates the deadline by which the report must be issued, requiring \nthat it be issued on March 1, 2007, rather than a year later. Further, \nit requires the Commission to make recommendations addressing these \nshortages, so that our Nation can attempt to alleviate, ahead of time, \nany adverse impact that such shortages might have on the national \nsecurity of the United States.\n  We cannot wait to discover whether our Nation will be confronted with \nthese shortages. Once they are upon us, it will be too late. If we wait \nuntil confronted with the fact that our Nation can no longer access the \nmaterials it needs to feed its technological advancement or maintain \nits industrial base, the consequences could be disastrous. An ounce of \nprevention is worth a pound of cure, and we hope that by requiring this \nCommission to examine today possible shortages that could affect our \nNation's technology and industrial base tomorrow, we can enhance and \nprotect the national security of the United States.\n  I would note, in closing, that our amendment will also make certain \nthat representatives of small business can join labor representatives \nand others associated with the defense industry as members of this new \nCommission. I ask my colleague from Maine, the distinguished Chair of \nthe Small Business Committee, how exactly will this provision make \ncertain that the Commission has the benefit of obtaining a broad range \nof diverse opinions drawn from a wide cross-section of America?\n  Ms. SNOWE. I thank the distinguished Senator from West Virginia for \nhis question. Just like its previous version which I introduced on June \n3, this amendment is intended to ensure that small business interests \nare represented in the Commission's composition and in the subjects of \nthe Commission's activities.\n  As I stated before, the Commission's activities will be incomplete \nwithout taking into account small business contributions to our \nNation's defense. The most recent data from the Department of Defense \nsuggests that more work needs to be done to secure small business \naccess to national defense contracts. Representatives of small business \ncontracting concerns would make important contributions to the work of \nthe Commission. In addition, the Commission would benefit from \nparticipation by the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business \nAdministration or his representative. Congress and President Bush \nendowed the Chief Counsel's Office of Advocacy with the unique mandate \nto represent America's small businesses before the agencies of our \ngovernment. The Chief Counsel's trained staff of economists, analysts, \nand lawyers would provide much needed perspectives for the Commission \ndeliberations.\n  I thank Senator Byrd, Chairman Warner and Senator Levin for their \nwork for America's small business. I also wish to thank the esteemed \nSenators Allen, Coleman, and Kerry for their support.\n  Mr. BYRD. I commend the distinguished Chair Snowe for her tireless \nefforts on behalf of America's industrial base.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, last night the Senate accepted two very \nimportant amendments to level the playing field for Federal employees \nwhose jobs are being contracted out. I am so pleased that we agreed to \nthe Kennedy-Chambliss amendment to fix the worst problems with DoD's \ncontracting out process, and the Collins amendment to--at long last--\ngive Federal employees the right to protest contracting out decisions \nto an independent entity.\n  DoD is pursuing a political agenda masquerading as management reform. \nDoD's zeal for privatization costs money, it costs morale, it costs the \nintegrity of the civil service, and now it's costing our reputation in \nIraq. I was shocked to hear about about the role of contractors in the \nappalling abuse of prisoners at Abu Ghraib. DoD is taking contracting \nout too far. How can you contract out the interrogation of prisoners?\n  America needs an independent civil service. Our Federal employees are \non the front lines every day working hard for America. At a time when \nwe are fighting terrorism and struggling with chaos in Iraq, how does \nthe administration thank DoD employees? By forcing them into unfair \ncompetitions. Forcing them to spend time and money competing for their \njobs instead of doing their jobs.\n  Make no mistake. I am not opposed to privatization. In some instances \nprivatization works well. Look at Goddard, in my State of Maryland \n3,000 government jobs and 9,000 private contractors. I am proud of them \nboth. What I am opposed to is the Bush administration stacking the deck \nagainst Federal employees to pursue an ideologically-driven agenda.\n  The Kennedy-Chambliss amendment fixes the worst problems with DoD's \nprocedures for contracting out to make competitions more fair for DoD \nemployees. The Kennedy-Chambliss amendment does six things to level the \nplaying field. It guarantees employees the right to submit their own \n``best bid'' during a competition. It requires contractors to show that \nthey are actually saving money. It makes sure privatization doesn't \ncome at the expense\n\n[[Page S6790]]\n\nof health benefits for employees. It closes loopholes that allow DoD to \ncontract out jobs without a competition. It establishes a process for \nallowing and encouraging Federal employees to conduct new work and work \ncurrently performed by contractors. And it makes sure that DoD has the \ninfrastructure in place to effectively conduct competitions and oversee \nthe contracts.\n  This amendment is so important. Civilian employees at the Defense \nDepartment work hard to support our troops and to protect our country. \nIf we are going to contract out Defense Department work, we need to be \nvery cautious. It's a matter of national security. Can we trust a \nprivate company to do the job? What if the company goes out of \nbusiness? What if it is bought by a foreign company? How do we know a \nprivate company will have the same mission--and the same motive as U.S. \nmilitary personnel?\n  The Bush administration's rules do just the opposite. They're \nreckless. They give private contractors the edge--whether they deserve \nit or not. 75 percent of Federal jobs that were contracted out in 2002 \nand 2003 were DoD jobs. And DoD is targeting 240,000 more jobs for \nprivatization. More than 20 percent of DoD employees who lost their \njobs to contractors never had the chance to compete for their own jobs.\n  I want to know why the Bush administration is trying to undermine our \nFederal workforce--pushing a process so clearly stacked in favor of \nprivate contractors. Civilian Defense Department employees are not the \nenemy. Who are these employees? They are the shipbuilders at Naval \nAcademy in Annapolis, they are intelligence analysts, and they are the \nelectricians at the Pentagon--who know every nook and cranny of top \nsecret buildings.\n  These Federal employees are on the front lines. They lost their lives \nin the Pentagon on September 11. They are committed to making sure our \nsoldiers are ready to protect us. These men and women are dedicated and \nduty driven. They are not political strategists. They cannot be bought. \nWhy are some trying to make Federal employees the enemy? They aren't \npart of the problem, they are part of the solution. I know what Federal \nemployees do, how hard they work. I know they think of themselves first \nas citizens of the United States of America, second as workers at \nmission driven agencies.\n  The way the Defense Department pursues contracting out is \nirresponsible and dangerous. DoD is pushing contracting out even when \nit just doesn't make sense, even when it puts our Nation's security at \nrisk, or the integrity of our Armed Forces on the line. They are \npushing contracting out even when it costs more to conduct competitions \nthan it saves in the long run.\n  I know DoD isn't used to holding fair competitions. Look at their \ntrack record--no-bid contracts for cronies like Halliburton. But we \ncan't let the Defense Department's zeal for privatization get in the \nway of the ability of our Armed Forces to carry out their duties. And \nwe can't let them replace our civil service with cronyism and political \npatronage. That means putting some checks and balances on \nprivatization.\n  I also want to say a few words about an amendment that Senator \nCollins offered to give Federal employees the right to appeal unfair \ncontracting out decisions to GAO. This legislation is long overdue. \nContractors have always been allowed to appeal to GAO or to the Court \nof Federal Claims when they lose a competition. Yet Federal employees \ncan only appeal within their agency--the same agency that's trying to \ncontract them out. That is unfair.\n  Giving Federal employees the right to appeal is vital to level the \nplaying field during competitions, to hold agencies accountable for \nconducting fair competitions, and to make sure taxpayers are getting \nthe best deal.\n  The Collins amendment is a compromise. It doesn't give employees the \nexact same rights as contractors. For instance, they can't appeal to \nthe Court of Federal Claims. And it creates hurdles for allowing unions \nto represent their members in an appeal. I am sick of union busting. I \nthink we can do more for employees. I hope we fix these problems as the \nprocess moves forward. But we can't let the perfect be the enemy of the \ngood. I support the Collins amendment because it is a good compromise, \nand it would--finally--allow employees to appeal when an agency makes a \nmistake.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/15/senate-section/article/S6790-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6790]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, this week marks the 125th anniversary of \nthe settlement of one of my state's oldest towns. Columbia, SD, located \nin Brown County in the northeastern part of my State, has a long and \nrich history that represents the spirit of hard work and community that \ndefines what it means to be from South Dakota.\n  In mid-June, 1879, a group of wagons loaded with supplies arrived at \nthe spot that would one day become Columbia, South Dakota. Under the \nleadership of Byron M. Smith of Minneapolis, the settlers took \nadvantage of the Elm River's abundant water supply, and began work on \nthe new town. Once the first post office was built and officially \nrecognized, the town of Columbia was born.\n  Today, residents of Columbia proudly reflect on a 125-year history, \nand the seemingly endless string of goals they have accomplished--and \nhardships they have had to endure--along the way. From the \nestablishment of the post office in 1879 to the dam that was built 3 \nyears later--creating Lake Columbia--to the construction of the town's \nfirst school, courthouse, and roller-skating rink, Columbia's first \ndecade saw its inhabitants lay the groundwork for the future of the \ncommunity. More than a century has passed since then, during which \nColumbia has survived fire, drought, dust storms, blizzards, and even a \ntornado on the town's 99th birthday. After 125 years of both good times \nand bad, the people of Columbia have emerged as strong and united as \never.\n  Truly, it is the people who have enabled Columbia to reach this \nremarkable milestone. The legacy of those original settlers has been \ncarried proudly to this day, and its reach is not limited to the corner \nof South Dakota where the town resides. In fact, Ralph Herseth, a \ngraduate of Columbia High School and a former Governor of South Dakota, \nis the grandfather of our State's newest representative, Stephanie \nHerseth. I am proud to join Representative Herseth and Senator Johnson \nin congratulating Columbia on its 125th birthday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/15/senate-section/article/S6790-3", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6790-S6791]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ON THE RETIREMENT OF ROYCE FEOUR\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Royce Feour who \nrecently retired after reporting on boxing and sports for the Las Vegas \nReview-Journal for nearly 37 years.\n  Royce is a legend in Nevada sports reporting. He started his career \nin journalism half a century ago at age 14 when he covered prep sports \nfor the Review Journal and the High School Sports Association.\n  He continued writing about sports at the University of Nevada-Reno \nwith the support of two journalism scholarships. He became the editor \nof the school paper, and a correspondent for the Reno Evening Gazette \nand the Nevada State Journal.\n  After he graduated, Royce worked for 5 years at Las Vegas Sun, where \nhe became sports editor. He reported on the first football and baseball \ngames at what was back then the Nevada Southern University--now UNLV. \nAt that first football game, it was so dark by the end of the game that \nno one in the press box could tell if the winning kick was good.\n  Royce covered the recruitment of UNLV basketball coach Jerry \nTarkanian, who lost his first game and offered to quit that same night. \nThe offer was declined, and Tarkanian went on to win 509 games in 19 \nseasons, and an NCAA championship in 1990.\n  Royce was a sportswriter, but he was also a newspaper man. So when an \nearthquake struck San Francisco and rocked the upper deck of \nCandlestick Park while he was covering game 3 of\n\n[[Page S6791]]\n\nthe 1988 World Series, he got on the phone and dictated a story about \nthe quake.\n  Royce is best known for covering boxing in Las Vegas. He has reported \non nearly every major championship fight in the city, going back to the \nSonny Liston-Floyd Patterson heavyweight title bout at the Las Vegas \nConvention Center in 1963. He has chronicled the careers of boxing \nlegends such as Muhammed Ali, Lennox Lewis, Roy Jones, Evander \nHolyfield, Riddick Bowe, Julio Cesar Chavez, Roberto Duran, Larry \nHolmes, Mike Tyson, Sugar Ray Leonard, Marvin Hagler, Roy Jones Jr., \nThomas Hearns and Oscar de La Hoya.\n  For his incredible work, Royce has earned several Nevada Press \nAssociation awards and was named Writer of the Year by the North \nAmerican Boxing Federation. He was the Las Vegas Boxing Hall of Fame's \nLocal Media Man of the Year. And in 1996, he was awarded the Nat \nFleischer Award for ``Excellence in Boxing Journalism'' by the Boxing \nWriters Association of America.\n  That is the highest honor that can be given to a boxing reporter. But \nI honor Royce for his brand of friendship. Royce, thanks for being my \nfriend.\n  Royce Feour's exceptional skills and lasting devotion to his trade \nare remarkable. He is truly one of the heavyweights of the Nevada \npress. Please join me in honoring his years of extraordinary work, and \nwishing him well in his retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/15/senate-section/article/S6791-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6791]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CONGRATULATIONS TO SPARKS, NEVADA\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise to offer my congratulations to the \nCity of Sparks, NV, which was recently selected as a finalist in the \n2004 All-America City competition.\n  Sparks is a city of about 80,000 residents in Washoe County, which is \nin northern Nevada. Under the leadership of Mayor Tony Armstrong, it is \na wonderful place to live, even better than it has been in the past.\n  The All-America City Award is sponsored by the National Civic League, \nwhich was founded 110 years ago by Theodore Roosevelt to promote \ncitizenship and democracy.\n  Since the award was initiated in 1949, more than 4,000 communities \nhave competed for the coveted designation as an All-America City. This \nyear, hundreds of cities began the process, which requires extensive \ndocumentation of how the community is responding to challenges. Sparks \nwas selected as one of the 30 finalists.\n  Nevada is the fastest growing State in the country. Sparks is doing a \ngreat job of absorbing growth, while preserving the hometown family \natmosphere that makes it so attractive to longtime residents and \nnewcomers alike.\n  Sparks has also done a great job of revitalizing its infrastructure, \nespecially in the wake of a massive flood a few years ago. Sparks \nMarina Park and the Victorian Square redevelopment project are two \nexamples of this renewal.\n  Sparks has always been a great place to live and raise a family. Now \nit can boast of being an All-America City finalist. Once again, I \ncongratulate the Mayor, City Council and the citizens of Sparks, NV.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/15/senate-section/article/S6791-2", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6791-S6792]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               CBO REPORT\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, at the time S. Rep. No. 108-269 was \nfiled, the Congressional Budget Office report was not available. At the \nfollowing link, ftp://ftp.cho.gov/54xx/doc5479/s1582.pdf, the CBO \nreport for S. 1582 is now available on their Web site, and I ask \nunanimous consent that the CBO cost estimate be printed in the Record \nfor the information of the Senate.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n     S. 1582--Valles Caldera Preservation Act of 2004\n       Summary: Public Law 106-248 established the Valles Caldera \n     Preserve in New Mexico. That law also established the Valles \n     Caldera Trust, a government-owned corporation, to manage the \n     preserve. S. 1582 would make several changes to Public Law \n     106-248. One of those changes would authorize the Secretary \n     of Agriculture to acquire, by taking, certain subsurface \n     rights to the Baca Ranch, which lies within the preserve. \n     Under the bill, the owners of those subsurface rights would \n     be entitled to just compensation as determined by a court.\n       CBO estimates that S. 1582 would increase direct spending \n     by about $3 million in 2007. Enacting the bill would not \n     affect revenues. S. 1582 contains no intergovernmental \n     mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act \n     (UMRA) and would have no significant impact on the budgets of \n     state, local, or tribal governments.\n       In the event that the Secretary of Agriculture uses a \n     declaration of taking to acquire certain mineral interests of \n     the Baca Ranch, such an acquisition would constitute a \n     private-sector mandate as defined by UMRA. The cost of the \n     mandate would be the fair market value of the mineral \n     interests and expenses incurred by the private-sector owners \n     in transferring those interests to the federal government. \n     Based on information from government sources, CBO estimates \n     that the direct cost of the mandate would fall well below the \n     annual threshold established by UMRA for private-sector \n     mandates ($120 million in 2002, adjusted annually for \n     inflation).\n       Estimated Cost to the Federal Government: The estimated \n     budgetary impact of S. 1582 is shown in the following table. \n     The costs of this legislation fall within budget function 300 \n     (natural resources and environment) and 800 (general \n     government).\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                        By fiscal year, in millions of dollars--\n                                                               -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                  2005     2006     2007     2008     2009     2010     2011     2012     2013     2014\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                               CHANGES IN DIRECT SPENDING\n \nEstimated budget authority....................................        0        0        1        0        0        0        0        0        0        0\nEstimated outlays.............................................        0        0        3        0        0        0        0        0        0        0\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       Basis of Estimate: For this estimate, CBO assumes that S. \n     1582 will be enacted near the start of fiscal year 2005 and \n     that the federal government will assume ownership of the \n     subsurface rights soon thereafter. Based on information from \n     the Department of the Interior about the length of time \n     typically required to resolve similar cases, we assume that a \n     court would award a total of $3 million in compensation to \n     the owners of those subsurface rights during fiscal year \n     2007.\n       According to the Forest Service, the appraised value of the \n     subsurface rights to be taken is about $2 million. In \n     addition, based on information about historical differences \n     between federal appraisals and amounts awarded by courts to \n     compensate takings of private property in New Mexico, CBO \n     estimates that an additional $1 million would be awarded to \n     the owners of those subsurface rights. Hence, we estimate \n     that payments to those parties would total about $3 million \n     in 2007.\n       S. 1582 specifies two sources of funds to make that \n     payment. First, the bill would require the Forest Service to \n     use existing funds to compensate the owners of the subsurface \n     rights for the appraised value of those rights. Second, S. \n     1582 would provide authority to use the Claims and Judgments \n     Fund to pay additional amounts awarded by the court. For this \n     estimate, CBO assumes that the agency would use $2 million of \n     funds appropriated for land acquisition in fiscal year 2004--\n     funds that CBO estimates are available but not likely to be \n     spent under current law--to pay a portion of the compensation \n     amount. Hence, we estimate that the bill would provide new \n     budget authority of $1 million in 2007.\n       Estimated Impact on State, Local, and Tribal Governments: \n     S. 1582 contains no intergovernment mandates as defined in \n     UMRA and would have no significant impact on the budgets of \n     state, local, or tribal governments.\n       Estimated Impact on the Private Sector: In the event that \n     the Secretary of Agriculture uses a declaration of taking to \n     acquire certain mineral interests of the Baca Ranch, such an \n     acquisition would constitute a private-sector mandate as \n     defined by UMRA. The cost of the mandate would be the fair \n     market value of the mineral interests and expenses incurred \n     by the private-sector owners in transferring those interests \n     to the federal government. Based on\n\n[[Page S6792]]\n\n     information from government sources, CBO estimates that the \n     direct cost of the mandate would fall well below the annual \n     threshold established by UMRA for private-sector mandates \n     ($120 million in 2002, adjusted annually for inflation).\n       The bill would direct the Secretary of Agriculture to \n     acquire the mineral interests without the seller's consent \n     should negotiations for a sale fail after 60 days. Should \n     those negotiations fail, the Secretary of Agriculture would \n     be required to file a declaration of taking with the court. \n     The declaration of taking would force the owners of the \n     geothermal and mineral interests to give up ownership in \n     exchange for a sum equal to the fair market value as \n     determined by the court. As noted above, an appraisal done by \n     the Forest Service in 2001 concluded that the privately held \n     mineral and geothermal interests on the Baca Ranch have a \n     fair market value of almost $2 million. In December 2001, the \n     Forest Service's offer for purchase of the interests based on \n     this appraisal was rejected.\n       Estimate Prepared by: Federal Costs: Megan Carroll.

Mr. President, today the U.S.-China Economic and Security \nReview Commission issued its second major annual report to the \nCongress, as mandated by the Congress in its enabling statute, P.L. \n106-398, October 30, 2000, as amended by Division P of P.L. 108-7 \nFebruary 20, 2003. I commend it to my colleagues as a comprehensive, \ninsightful and useful examination of the key trends, policies and \nrealities inherent in the U.S./China relationship, and featuring a \nnumber of recommendations for the Congress to consider.\n  It is noteworthy that the Commission adopted this report by a \nunanimous, bipartisan vote of 11-0. The commission is composed of an \nequal number of Democratic and Republican appointees, three each by the \nfour leaders of the Senate and the House of Representatives. It is \nrefreshing, indeed, in an era characterized by far too much \npartisanship and divisiveness, that in its treatment of the often \ncontentious and important issues regarding this growing bilateral \nrelationship, the Commission could reach a unanimous vote. Debates over \nforeign policy, it has often been said, to be effective, should end at \nthe water's edge, and we should speak as a Nation with one voice to the \nworld. Mr. President, in this report, bipartisan unanimity has been \nachieved, and by a very diverse group of thoughtful and independent \nminded Commissioners. I would also point out that this is a purely \ncongressional body, in that all of the commissioners are appointed by \nthe congressional leadership, and the report which is issued is \nintended to be exclusively advisory to the Congress.\n  The mandate of the U.S.-China Commission is to ``monitor, \ninvestigate, and report to Congress on the national security \nimplications of the bilateral trade and economic relationship between \nthe United States and the People's Republic of China.'' The commission, \ntherefore, takes an expansive view of U.S. national security, which is \nthat our economic health and well-being are fundamental national \nsecurity matters, including the maintenance of a strong manufacturing \nbase, and the ability to maintain U.S. global competitiveness and a \nhealthy employment level and growth rate. These central economic \nfactors are just as essential to the national security and defense of \nour Nation as are strong and ready standing armies, navies and air \nforces equipped with the best weaponry, leadership and operational \ndoctrines.\n  In addition, the commission has treated, very thoroughly, a series of \nspecific topics mandated in amendments to its charter last year, \nincluding China's proliferation practices, China's economic reforms and \nU.S. economic transfers to China, China's energy needs, Chinese firms' \naccess to the U.S. capital markets, U.S. investments into China, \nChina's economic and security impacts in Asia, U.S.-China bilateral \nprograms and agreements, China's record of compliance with its World \nTrade Organization, WTO, commitments, and the Chinese government's \nmedia control efforts.\n  Mr. President, I will not recite all the many important conclusions \nand recommendations for action contained in this timely report. But I \npoint out that the United States needs to be much more proactive and \nclear-thinking in managing our overall relationship with China, and far \nmore focused on what our goals are in the relationship if we are to \nadvance our national economic and security interests.\n  The report concludes, overall, that the U.S.-China economic \nrelationship lacks active management. U.S. goals for specific elements \nof the relationship are too vague or even nonexistent. This is \nparticularly highlighted in the enormous goods trade deficit, some $123 \nbillion in 2003, and growing rapidly. The United States has the \ncapability to nudge the Chinese into more positive policies and \nactions, thereby leveling a playing field which China has tilted in the \ndirection of mercantilist behavior, including, in some arenas, \nintimidating tactics. Issues which have been festering in the WTO, for \ninstance, such as China's artificial manipulation of the value of her \ncurrency, continued tolerance of high levels of Intellectual Property \nCrimes, massive illegal subsidization of Chinese enterprises, \nresistance to good faith compliance with important WTO procedures, and \nwith many pledges made for progress in proliferation of WMD, all \nrequire heightened levels of attention and management by the United \nStates\n  The United States certainly has such influence at this period, and \nfor the next few years, because of the enormous dependence of China on \nour good will, our consumer markets, our manufacturing capability, our \ntechnology and our cooperation in many fields. Such dependence will not \nlast forever, however, and it is time that we begin to manage this \nrelationship in ways that will produce more positive and favorable \noutcomes.\n  Lastly, Mr. President, this report is studded with recommendations \nfor Congressional action and for joint policy-making efforts between \nthe Congress and the Executive Branch. It recognizes that good policy \nproceeds from building a strong consensus between our two branches, as \nwell as between our two countries. I encourage my colleagues, many of \nwhom have testified on these matters before the Commission, to examine \nthe recommendations offered for our consideration.\n  Mr. President, the Commission has today issued this fulsome report, \nand I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the \nCommission's list of recommendations.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Recommendations to Congress\n\n\n Chapter 1--China's Industrial, Investment, and Exchange Rate Policies\n\n     Recommendations for dealing with China's currency manipulation\n\n       The 1988 Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act requires the \n     Treasury Department to examine whether countries are \n     manipulating their exchange rates for purposes of gaining \n     international competitive advantage. The Treasury is to \n     arrive at its finding in consultation with the IMF, which \n     defines manipulation as ``protracted large-scale intervention \n     in one direction in the exchange market.'' The Treasury has \n     repeatedly evaded reporting on this test. The Commission \n     recommends that Congress require the Treasury to explicitly \n     address this test in its required report to Congress. \n     Furthermore, a condition for taking action against a country \n     that manipulates its currency is that an offending country be \n     running a material global current account surplus in addition \n     to a bilateral surplus. The Commission recommends that \n     Congress amend this provision so that a material global \n     current account surplus is not a required condition.\n       The administration should use all appropriate and available \n     tools at its disposal to address and correct the problem of \n     currency manipulation by China and other East Asian \n     countries. With regard to China, this means bringing about a \n     substantial upward revaluation of the yuan against the \n     dollar. Thereafter, the yuan should be pegged to a trade-\n     weighted basket of currencies, and provisions should be \n     established to guide future adjustments if needed. As part of \n     this process, the Treasury Department should engage in \n     meaningful bilateral negotiation with the Chinese government, \n     and it should also engage in meaningful bilateral \n     negotiations with Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea regarding \n     ending their long-standing exchange\n\n[[Page S6793]]\n\n     rate manipulation. The administration should concurrently \n     encourage our trading partners with similar interests to join \n     in this effort. The Commission recommends that Congress \n     pursue legislative measures that direct the administration to \n     take action--through the WTO or otherwise--to combat China's \n     exchange rate practices in the event that no concrete \n     progress is forthcoming.\n\nRecommendations for addressing China's mercantilist industrial and FDI \n                                policies\n\n       The Commission recommends that Congress direct the United \n     States Trade Representative (USTR) and the Department of \n     Commerce to undertake immediately a comprehensive \n     investigation of China's system of government subsidies for \n     manufacturing, including tax incentives, preferential access \n     to credit and capital from state-owned financial \n     institutions, subsidized utilities, and investment conditions \n     requiring technology transfers. The investigation should also \n     examine discriminatory consumption credits that shift demand \n     toward Chinese goods, Chinese state-owned banks' practice of \n     noncommercial-based policy lending to state-owned and other \n     enterprises, and China's dual pricing system for coal and \n     other energy sources. USTR and Commerce should provide the \n     results of this investigation in a report to Congress that \n     assesses whether any of these practices may be actionable \n     subsidies under the WTO and lays out specific steps the U.S. \n     government can take to address these practices.\n       The Commission recommends that Congress direct the \n     administration to undertake a comprehensive review and \n     reformation of the government's trade enforcement \n     infrastructure in light of the limited efforts that have been \n     directed at enforcing our trade laws. Such a review should \n     include consideration of a proposal by Senator Ernest \n     Hollings (D-SC) to establish an assistant attorney general \n     for international trade enforcement in the Department of \n     Justice to enhance our capacity to enforce our trade laws. \n     Moreover, the U.S. government needs to place an emphasis on \n     enforcement of international labor standards and appropriate \n     environmental standards.\n       The Commission recommends that Congress direct the \n     administration to work with other interested WTO members to \n     convene an emergency session of the WTO governing body to \n     extend the MFA at least through 2008 to provide additional \n     time for impacted industries to adjust to surges in imports \n     from China.\n\n\n     Chapter 2--China in the World Trade Organization: Compliance, \n                      Monitoring, and Enforcement\n\n       The Commission recommends that Congress press the \n     administration to make more use of the WTO dispute settlement \n     mechanism and/or U.S. trade laws to redress unfair Chinese \n     trade practices. In particular, the administration should act \n     promptly to address China's exchange rate manipulation, \n     denial of trading and distribution rights, lack of IPR \n     protection, objectionable labor standards, and subsidies to \n     export industries. In pursuing these cases, Congress should \n     encourage USTR to consult with trading partners who have \n     mutual interests at the outset of each new trade dispute with \n     China.\n       The Commission recommends that Congress press the \n     administration to make better use of the China-specific \n     section 421 and textile safeguards negotiated as part of \n     China's WTO accession agreement to give relief to U.S. \n     industries especially hard hit by surges in imports from \n     China.\n       Notwithstanding China's commitments at the April 2004 JCCT \n     meeting, the Commission recommends that Congress press the \n     administration to file a WTO dispute on the matter of China's \n     failure to protect intellectual property rights. China's WTO \n     obligation to protect intellectual property rights demands \n     not only that China promulgate appropriate legislation and \n     regulations, including enacting credible criminal penalties, \n     but also that these rules be enforced. China has repeatedly \n     promised, over many years, to take significant action. \n     Follow-through and action have been limited and, therefore, \n     the Commission believes that immediate U.S. action is \n     warranted.\n       The Commission recommends that Congress urge the Department \n     of Commerce to make countervailing duty laws applicable to \n     nonmarket economies. If Commerce does not do so, Congress \n     should pass legislation to achieve the same effect. U.S. \n     policy currently prevents application of countervailing duty \n     laws to nonmarket economy countries such as China. This \n     limits the ability of the United States to combat China's \n     extensive use of subsidies that give Chinese companies an \n     unfair competitive advantage.\n       The Commission recommends that Congress encourage the \n     administration to make a priority of obtaining and ensuring \n     China's compliance with its WTO commitments to refrain from \n     forced technology transfers that are used as a condition of \n     doing business. The transfer of technology by U.S. investors \n     in China as a direct or indirect government-imposed condition \n     of doing business with Chinese partners remains an enduring \n     U.S. security concern as well as a violation of China's WTO \n     agreement. A WTO complaint should be filed when instances \n     occur.\n       The Commission recommends that Congress encourage USTR and \n     other appropriate U.S. government officials to take action to \n     ensure that the WTO's Transitional Review Mechanism process \n     is a meaningful multilateral review that measures China's \n     compliance with its WTO commitments. If China continues to \n     frustrate the TRM process, the U.S. government should \n     initiate a parallel process that includes a specific and \n     comprehensive measurement system. The United States should \n     work with the European Union, Japan, and other major trading \n     partners to produce a separate, unified annual report that \n     measures and reports on China's progress toward compliance \n     and coordinates a plan of action to address shortcomings. \n     This report should be provided to Congress. In addition, \n     independent assessments of China's WTO compliance conducted \n     by the U.S. government, such as USTR's annual report, should \n     be used as inputs in the multilateral forum evaluating \n     China's compliance, whether that forum is a reinvigorated \n     and effective TRM or a new process.\n       The Commission recommends that Congress consider options to \n     assist small- and medium-sized business in pursuing trade \n     remedies under U.S. law, such as through section 421 cases.\n\n\n       Chapter 3--China's Presence in the Global Capital Markets\n\n       The Commission recommends that Congress reinstate the \n     reporting provision of the 2003 Intelligence Authorization \n     Act [P.L. 107-306, Sec 827] directing the director of Central \n     Intelligence (DCI) to prepare an annual report identifying \n     Chinese or other foreign companies determined to be engaged \n     or involved in the proliferation of weapons of mass \n     destruction or their delivery systems that have raised, or \n     attempted to raise, funds in the U.S. capital markets. The \n     Commission further recommends that Congress expand this \n     provision to require the DCI to undertake a broader review of \n     the security-related concerns of Chinese firms accessing, or \n     seeking to access, the U.S. capital markets. This should \n     include the establishment of a new interagency process of \n     consultations and coordination among the National Security \n     Council, the Treasury Department, the State Department, the \n     SEC, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the \n     intelligence community regarding Chinese companies listing or \n     seeking to list in the U.S. capital markets. The aim of such \n     an interagency process should be to improve collection \n     management and assign a higher priority to assessing any \n     linkages between proliferation and other security-related \n     concerns and Chinese companies, including their parents and \n     subsidiaries, with a presence in the U.S. capital markets.\n       The Commission recommends that Congress require mutual \n     funds to more fully disclose the specific risks of \n     investments in China. This should include disclosure to \n     investors of the identities of any local firms subcontracted \n     by funds to perform due diligence on Chinese firms held in \n     their portfolios. Subcontractors' principal researchers, \n     location, experience, and potential conflicts of interest \n     should all be disclosed.\n       The Commission recommends that Congress direct the Commerce \n     Department and USTR to evaluate whether Chinese state-owned \n     banks' practice of noncommercial-based policy lending to \n     state-owned and other enterprises constitutes an actionable \n     WTO-inconsistent government subsidy and include this \n     evaluation in the report on subsidies recommended in Chapter \n     1.\n       In its 2002 Report, the Commission recommended that \n     Congress prohibit debt or equity offerings in U.S. capital \n     markets by any Chinese or foreign entity upon which the State \n     Department has imposed sanctions for engaging in the \n     proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) or \n     ballistic missile delivery systems. The Commission further \n     believes that Congress should bar U.S. institutional or \n     private investors from making debt or equity investments, \n     directly or indirectly, in firms identified and sanctioned by \n     the U.S. government for weapons proliferation-related \n     activities, whether they are listed and traded in the United \n     States or in the Chinese or other international capital \n     markets. For example, NORINCO, a company sanctioned by the \n     U.S. government, is currently available for purchase on the \n     Chinese A share market. U.S.-based qualified foreign \n     institutional investors that have rights to trade on this \n     exchange should not be permitted to invest in NORINCO or any \n     other firm officially determined to have engaged in the \n     proliferation of WMD or ballistic missiles.\n\n\n   Chapter 4--China's Regional Economic and Security Impacts and the \n                   Challenges of Hong Kong and Taiwan\n\n                          Regional engagement\n\n       The Commission recommends that Congress revitalize U.S. \n     engagement with China's Asian neighbors by encouraging U.S. \n     diplomatic efforts to identify and pursue initiatives to \n     demonstrate the United States' firm commitment to \n     facilitating the economic and security needs of the region. \n     These initiatives should have a regional focus and complement \n     bilateral efforts. The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation \n     forum (APEC) offers a ready mechanism for pursuit of such \n     initiatives. The United States should consider further \n     avenues of cooperation by associating with regional forums of \n     which it is not a member.\n\n                               Hong Kong\n\n       The Commission recommends that Congress consult with the \n     administration to assess jointly whether the PRC's recent \n     interventions impacting Hong Kong's autonomy constitute \n     grounds for invoking the terms of the U.S.-Hong Kong Policy \n     Act with regard to Hong Kong's separate treatment. This \n     includes U.S. bilateral relations with Hong\n\n[[Page S6794]]\n\n     Kong in areas such as air services, customs treatment, \n     immigration quotas, visa issuance, and export controls. In \n     this context, Congress should assess the implications of the \n     National People's Congress Standing Committee's intrusive \n     interventions with regard to matters of universal suffrage \n     and direct elections. Congress and the administration should \n     continue to keep Hong Kong issues on the U.S.-PRC bilateral \n     agenda and work closely with the United Kingdom on Hong Kong \n     issues.\n\n                          Cross-strait issues\n\n       The Commission recommends that Congress enhance its \n     oversight role in the implementation of the Taiwan Relations \n     Act. Executive branch officials should be invited to consult \n     on intentions and report on actions taken to implement the \n     TRA through the regular committee hearing process of the \n     Congress, thereby allowing for appropriate public debate on \n     these important matters. This should include, at a minimum, \n     an annual report on Taiwan's request for any military \n     equipment and technology and a review of U.S.-Taiwan policy \n     in light of the growing importance of this issue in U.S.-\n     China relations.\n       The Commission recommends that the Congress and the \n     administration conduct a fresh assessment of the one China \n     policy, given the changing realities in China and Taiwan. \n     This should include a review of:\n       The policy's successes, failures, and continued viability;\n       Whether changes may be needed in the way the U.S. \n     government coordinates its defense assistance to Taiwan, \n     including the need for an enhanced operating relationship \n     between U.S. and Taiwan defense officials and the \n     establishment of a U.S.-Taiwan hotline for dealing with \n     crisis situations;\n       How U.S. policy can better support Taiwan's breaking out of \n     the international economic isolation that the PRC seeks to \n     impose on it and whether this issue should be higher on the \n     agenda in U.S.-China relations. Economic and trade policy \n     measures that could help ameliorate Taiwan's marginalization \n     in the Asian regional economy should also be reviewed. These \n     should include enhanced U.S.-Taiwan bilateral trade \n     arrangements that would include protections for labor rights, \n     the environment, and other important U.S. interests.\n       To support this policy review, the Commission recommends \n     that the appropriate committees of Congress request that the \n     executive branch make available to them a comprehensive \n     catalogue and copies of all the principal formal \n     understandings and other communications between the United \n     States and both China and Taiwan as well as other key \n     historical documents clarifying U.S. policy toward Taiwan.\n       The Commission recommends that Congress consult with the \n     administration on developing appropriate ways for the United \n     States to facilitate actively cross-Strait dialogue that \n     could promote the long-term, peaceful resolution of \n     differences between the two sides and could lead to direct \n     trade and transport links and/or other cross-Strait \n     confidence-building measures. The administration should be \n     directed to report to Congress on the status of cross-Strait \n     dialogue, the current obstacles to such dialogue, and, if \n     appropriate, efforts that the United States could undertake \n     to promote such a dialogue.\n\n Chapter 5--China's Proliferation Practices and the Challenge of North \n                                 Korea\n\n       Should the current stalemate in the Six Party Talks \n     continue, the Commission recommends that Congress press the \n     administration to work with its regional partners, intensify \n     its diplomacy, and ascertain North Korean and Chinese \n     intentions with a detailed and staged proposal beginning with \n     a freeze of all North Korea's nuclear weapons programs, \n     followed by a verifiable and irreversible dismantlement of \n     those programs. Further work in this respect needs to be done \n     to determine whether a true consensus on goals and process \n     can be achieved with China. If this fails, the United States \n     must confer with its regional partners to develop new options \n     to resolve expeditiously the standoff with North Korea, \n     particularly in light of public assessments that the likely \n     North Korean uranium enrichment program might reach a stage \n     of producing weapons by 2007.\n       The Commission recommends that Congress press the \n     administration to renew efforts to secure China's agreement \n     to curtail North Korea's commercial export of ballistic \n     missiles and to encourage China to provide alternative \n     economic incentives for the North Koreans to substitute for \n     the foreign exchange that would be forgone as a result of \n     that curtailment.\n       As recommended in the Commission's 2002 Report, and now \n     similarly proposed by President Bush and the U.N. Secretary \n     General, the Commission reiterates that Congress should \n     support U.S. efforts to work with the U.N. Security Council \n     to create a new U.N. framework for monitoring the \n     proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their \n     delivery systems in conformance with member nations' \n     obligations under the Nuclear NonProliferation Treaty, the \n     Biological Weapons Convention, and the Chemical Weapons \n     Convention. This new monitoring body would be delegated \n     authority to apply sanctions to countries violating these \n     treaties in a timely manner or, alternatively, would be \n     required to report all violations in a timely manner to the \n     Security Council for discussion and sanctions.\n       As recommended in the Commission's 2002 Report, the \n     Commission reiterates that Congress should act to broaden and \n     harmonize proliferation sanctions by amending all current \n     statutes that pertain to proliferation to include a new \n     section authorizing the president to invoke economic \n     sanctions against foreign nations that proliferate WMD and \n     technologies associated with WMD and their delivery systems. \n     These economic sanctions would include import and export \n     limitations, restrictions on access to U.S. capital markets, \n     restrictions on foreign direct investment into an offending \n     country, restrictions on transfers by the U.S. government of \n     economic resources, and restrictions on science and \n     technology cooperation or transfers. The new authority should \n     require the President to report to Congress the rationale and \n     proposed duration of the sanctions within seventy-two hours \n     of imposing them. Although the president now has the \n     authority to select from the full range of economic and \n     security-related sanctions, these sanctions are case specific \n     and relate to designated activities within a narrow set of \n     options available on a case-by-case basis.\n\n\n             Chapter 6--China's Energy Needs and Strategies\n\n       The Commission recommends that Congress direct the \n     secretaries of State and Energy to consult with the \n     International Energy Agency with the objective of upgrading \n     the current loose experience-sharing arrangement, whereby \n     China engages in some limited exchanges with the \n     organization, to a more structured arrangement whereby the \n     PRC would be obligated to develop a meaningful strategic \n     reserve, and coordinate release of stocks in supply \n     disruption crises or speculator-driven price spikes.\n       The Commission recommends that Congress encourage work that \n     increases bilateral cooperation in improving China's energy \n     efficiency and environmental performance, such as further \n     cooperation in Clean Coal Technology and waste-to-liquid-\n     fuels programs, subject to any overriding concerns regarding \n     technology transfers. Further, the commission recommends that \n     Congress direct the State and Energy departments, and the \n     intelligence community, to conduct an annual review of \n     China's international energy relationships and its energy \n     practices during times of global energy crises to determine \n     whether such U.S. assistance continues to be justified.\n       The Commission recommends that the Commerce Department and \n     USTR investigate whether China's dual pricing system for coal \n     and any other energy sources constitutes a prohibited subsidy \n     under the WTO and include this assessment in the Commerce/\n     USTR report on subsidies recommended in Chapter 1.\n\n\n Chapter 7--China's High-Technology Development and U.S.-China Science \n                       and Technology Cooperation\n\n       The U.S. government must develop a coordinated, \n     comprehensive national policy and strategy designed to meet \n     China's challenge to the maintenance of our scientific and \n     technological leadership. America's economic competitiveness, \n     standard of living, and national security are dependent on \n     such leadership. The Commission therefore recommends that \n     Congress charge the administration to develop and publish \n     such a strategy in the same way it is presently required to \n     develop and publish a national security strategy that deals \n     with our military and political challenges around the world. \n     In developing this strategy, the administration should \n     utilize data presently compiled by the Department of Commerce \n     to track our nation's technological competitiveness in \n     comparison with other countries.\n       The Commission recommends that Congress revise the law \n     governing the CFIUS process (Title VII of the Defense \n     Production Act)--which gives the president authority to \n     investigate mergers, acquisitions, or takeovers of U.S. firms \n     by foreign persons if such activities pose a threat to \n     national security--to expand the definition of national \n     security to include the potential impact on national economic \n     security as a criterion to be reviewed. In this regard, the \n     term national economic security should be defined broadly \n     without limitation to particular industries.\n       The Commission recommends that Congress direct the \n     administration to transfer chairmanship of CFIUS from the \n     Secretary of the Treasury to the Secretary of Commerce.\n\n\n Chapter 8--China's Military Modernization and the Cross-Strait Balance\n\n       The annual report to Congress recommended in Chapter 4 on \n     Taiwan's requests for military equipment and technology \n     should include an assessment of the new military systems \n     required by Taiwan to defend against advanced PRC offensive \n     capabilities.\n       As recommended in Chapter 4, Congress and the \n     administration should review the need for a direct \n     communications hotline between the United States and Taiwan \n     for dealing with crisis situations. This is important in \n     light of the short time frame of potential military scenarios \n     in the Strait, together with Chinese strategic doctrine \n     emphasizing surprise and deception.\n       The Commission recommends that Congress urge the president \n     and the secretaries of State and Defense to press strongly \n     their European Union counterparts to maintain the EU arms \n     embargo on China.\n       The Commission recommends that Congress direct the \n     administration to restrict foreign defense contractors who \n     sell sensitive military-use technology or weapons\n\n[[Page S6795]]\n\n     systems to China from participating in U.S. defense-related \n     cooperative research, development, and production programs. \n     This restriction can be targeted to cover only those \n     technology areas involved in the transfer to China.\n       The Commission recommends that Congress request the \n     Department of Defense to provide a comprehensive annual \n     report to the appropriate committees of Congress on the \n     nature and scope of foreign military sales to China, \n     particularly from Russia and Israel.\n\n\n           Chapter 9--Media and Information Control in China\n\n       On June 30, 2003, the Commission recommended that Congress \n     direct the Broadcasting Board of Governors to target funds \n     for efforts aimed at circumventing China's Internet firewall \n     through the development of anticensorship technologies and \n     methods. Congress approved such funding as part of the 2004 \n     Omnibus Appropriations Act. The Commission recommends that \n     Congress continue this program with enhanced resources, \n     pending successful results for the current fiscal year.\n       As recommended in the Commission's 2002 Report, the \n     Commission reiterates that Congress should direct the \n     Department of Commerce and other relevant agencies to conduct \n     a review of export administration regulations to determine \n     whether specific measures should be put in place to restrict \n     the export of U.S. equipment, software, and technologies that \n     permit the Chinese government to surveil its own people or \n     censor free speech.\n       The Commission recommends that Congress approve legislation \n     to establish an Office of Global Internet Freedom within the \n     executive branch, tasked with implementing a comprehensive \n     global strategy to combat state-sponsored blocking of the \n     Internet and persecution of users. The strategy should \n     include the development of anticensorship technologies.\n       The Commission recommends that Congress encourage the \n     administration to press China to freely admit U.S. \n     government-sponsored journalists, such as those representing \n     the Voice of America and Radio Free Asia. China frequently \n     denies visas for such journalists, despite the fact that \n     China's state-sponsored journalists are freely admitted in \n     the United States. Options should be considered for linking \n     Chinese cooperation to concrete consequences, including the \n     possible use of U.S. visas for Chinese government journalists \n     as leverage to gain admission of more U.S. government-\n     supported journalists to China.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/15/senate-section/article/S6795-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6795]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO RONALD AND NANCY REAGAN\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we have come to the close of several days \nof tribute to our late President, Ronald Reagan. So much has been said \nabout President Reagan's buoyant spirit and about the contributions he \nmade to our Nation, and these tributes have helped millions of \nAmericans with the healing process that comes with the death of so \npopular and beloved a leader.\n  Though much has already been said about President Reagan, I do want \nto pay special tribute today to our former First Lady, Nancy Reagan.\n  For me--and, I suspect, for millions of other Americans--some of the \nmost stirring images of this memorable week have been of Nancy Reagan \nand her family. We saw again, and so clearly, her strength, her \ncompassion and her deep love for her husband.\n  Ever since President Reagan's deeply moving announcement to his \nfellow citizens and to the world that he was suffering from Alzheimer's \ndisease, I have watched Mrs. Reagan conduct herself with compassion, \nloyalty, competence and caring that have been an inspiration to the \nthousands of family members who every day struggle to cope with loved \nones suffering from this disease or from any of the long variety of \nother disorders that can come upon us in our older ages--and sometimes \nfar earlier than that.\n  The Alzheimer's Association estimates that 4.5 million Americans \ntoday suffer from this debilitating disease. Often, family members and \nespecially, spouses--end up as primary caregivers to their partners or \nother family members. Along with the emotional pain and heartbreak of \nwatching the mind of a loved one slowly fade away, many caregivers are \nill-equipped to handle the many facets of the illness that present \nthemselves over the duration of this mental and physical struggle. \nTheir own physical health suffers. Managing a job or any other activity \noutside the home becomes almost impossible.\n  I believe Nancy Reagan is an inspiration to so many Americans. The \nlove that she and her husband so clearly showed to each other comforted \nand sustained their marriage in sickness, as it did in health.\n  Marcelle and I extend our best wishes to Mrs. Reagan and to the \nentire Reagan family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/15/senate-section/article/S6795-2", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6795-S6797]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     AUSTRALIA FREE TRADE AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, in the book of Ecclesiastes, the Preacher \nspoke of how there is ``a time to plan, and a time to uproot.'' The \nAmerican farmer has known this truth from the first days when Indians \nfirst walked to this continent.\n  Those of us who are privileged to represent rural States know well \nthe times of American farmers and ranchers. No matter what the time, \ntheir concerns are never far from our thoughts.\n  Times have changed for American agriculture, and for American jobs. \nIn 1900, 37 percent of American workers worked in agriculture. Now, \nonly about 2 percent do.\n  Of course, it doesn't seem like 2 percent to rural States such as \nMontana, North Dakota, and South Dakota, where agriculture can still \naccount for as much as 50 percent of the economy.\n  But that is the reality: American farmers are more productive than \never. And because productive American agriculture produces more than \nAmerican households consume, exports are as important as ever. That is \nwhy American farmers have been among the strongest supporters of \ninternational trade.\n  And it is about that intersection between American agriculture and \ninternational trade that I rise to speak today.\n  Last month, the United States and Australia signed a free trade \nagreement, taking an important step to connect two of the world's most \nvibrant economies. This agreement creates opportunities for both \ncountries. For Australia, it offers integration with the world's \nlargest economic power. For the United States, it offers a link to an \nAustralian market that has one of the highest standards of living in \nthe world--and is a key platform to markets in Asia.\n  In the coming weeks, we will hear about the significant economic \nbenefits of this agreement. But I think we should also look at this \nagreement in a broader context. First, we need to take a balanced look \nat the agreement and assess its costs and benefits. Second, we need to \nview the Australia agreement in the context of our larger trade agenda.\n  The benefits of the Australia agreement are compelling--particularly \nin the context of the current debate over jobs moving overseas.\n  When compared to some of the other agreements that the administration \nis negotiating, Australia offers real benefits. And it is not subject \nto some of the traditional criticisms.\n  Compare the debate over the Australia agreement to the debate over \nthe Central America agreement. Critics of CAFTA contend that Central \nAmerica's lower labor and environmental standards will undercut jobs \nhere at home. I share some of these concerns and continue to work hard \non strengthening these standards.\n  Yet, with the Australia agreement, this tension disappears. \nAustralian workers enjoy high labor standards. Australia protects its \nenvironment.\n  More importantly, Australian consumers want U.S. manufactured goods. \nAustralia is one of the few countries where the U.S. enjoys a trade \nsurplus. This fact helps explain the strong support of U.S. \nmanufacturers for this agreement--which they estimate will result in $2 \nbillion more in exports every year.\n  This free trade agreement offers clear benefits to the U.S. economy \nand to U.S. workers.\n  Thus the Australia agreement does not raises the usual concerns over \nlabor and the environment. But it does raise concerns over agriculture. \nAnd farmers are usually stalwart supporters of free trade.\n  Their anxieties are understandable. Australia is a major exporter of \nmany of the same commodities that Americans produce--particularly beef, \ndairy, and sugar. Yet, Australia offers a relatively small consumer \nmarket in exchange. So, while Australian farmers would get increased \naccess to our consumer market of around 250 million people, our farmers \nwould get increased access to an Australian consumer market that is \nmuch smaller.\n\n[[Page S6796]]\n\n  So when the administration announced late in 2002 that it intended to \nenter into negotiations with Australia, agriculture groups immediately \nvoiced concern.\n  As I looked at the negotiations, I saw two options. I could sit back, \nsay nothing, and hope for the best. This might have been politically \nexpedient, given the anxieties within the agriculture community, but it \nwould have risked getting a worse product, as a result.\n  Instead, I decided to engage the process, using my position as the \nranking Democrat on the Finance Committee to help shape the best \npossible agreement for our country and our farmers. After consulting \nwith the agriculture community in Montana, I decided that to do \notherwise would be a disservice to the many farmers and ranchers back \nhome who look to me to fight for them.\n  As I looked at this agreement, the potential concerns for beef, \ndairy, and sugar producers were clear. But I also saw potential gains \nfor Montana--including wheat farmers and pork producers, as well as \nMontana's growing technology manufacturing industries. With this in \nmind, I set out to help Ambassador Zoellick find ways to mitigate the \ndangers and maximize the gains.\n\n  My staff and I worked closely with the U.S. Trade Representative \nthroughout this process. And I met personally with the Australian Prime \nMinister and other officials. As negotiations entered a critical phase \nlast December, I spelled out to Ambassador Zoellick the sensitive areas \nfor Montana agriculture that needed his greatest attention. I also \noffered some ideas for how to manage them.\n  My staff and I worked tirelessly to ensure that negotiators--from \nboth countries--understood and accommodated the needs of Montanans. In \nearly February, the negotiators concluded an agreement that addressed \nsensitive Montana products with great care. The U.S. Trade \nRepresentative addressed my concerns on virtually every commodity.\n  While Australia agreed to the immediate elimination of all tariffs on \nmany U.S. agricultural products, the U.S. received important \nprotections.\n  Beef. On beef, my first concern was ensuring that the U.S. gets what \nis called ``access for access.'' In other words, the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative should undertake new agreements and find new export \nmarkets to offset potential increased imports from Australia. The \nproposed U.S.-Thailand agreement, for example, will help us reach that \ngoal. Thailand's population is three times larger than Australia's, \nwith a consumer market that is growing quickly. We need to build on the \nThailand agreement by opening other significant markets--particularly \nin Asia.\n  But we are several years from finishing the Thailand agreement. And \nwe are likely several years from completing the current round of \nnegotiations in the WTO. So we need to make sure that increased access \nto our market is far enough down the road that it will be offset by \nother agreements. To address this, I worked with USTR to ensure a \nsignificant transition period. As a result, access for Australian beef \nwill increase very slowly, with duties in place for 18 years. \nImportantly, the agreement only provides increased access for \nmanufactured beef--other beef products will continue to face the same \nduties they face today.\n  I also worked to ensure the agreement contained special safeguards--\nso that there is not a surge of Australian imports into the U.S. \nmarket. As a result, the agreement contains two safeguards--one in \neffect during the 18-year transition, and another taking effect in year \n19 to remain in place indefinitely.\n  Dairy. For dairy, this agreement recognizes the sensitivity of this \nindustry by retaining existing tariffs indefinitely. Most importantly \nfor Montana, tariffs for milk protein concentrates are unaffected by \nthe agreement.\n  Sugar. Perhaps the most difficult issue in the agreement was how to \naddress the concerns of the U.S. sugar industry. This industry faces \nextreme distortions on the global market, for example, high export \nsubsidies in Europe. These distortions chronically depress the world \nprice far below the world's average cost of production. For these \nreasons, sugar policy must be addressed multilaterally in the WTO \nnegotiations.\n  In this agreement, Ambassador Zoellick took a difficult and \ncontroversial step in excluding sugar entirely from the agreement. Some \nhave criticized him for this. But not this Senator and those I \nrepresent.\n  Sheep. Even for Montana sheep ranchers, who already face free trade \nin lamb, the agreement delays the elimination of the few remaining wool \ntariffs, rather than providing for their immediate elimination. This \ncomes on the heels of initial efforts by the U.S. and Australian \nindustries to establish a joint marketing effort aimed at increasing \nconsumption of lamb.\n  Wheat. On wheat, which is a major Montana export, the agreement makes \nsome progress toward our ultimate goal of reforming global markets. The \nU.S. industry and I had both hoped to secure an Australian commitment \nto restructure the Australian Wheat Board, a state trading enterprise, \nor STE, that acts as a monopoly trader controlling the Australian \nmarket. Because Australia is a significant exporter of wheat, their \nartificially low prices distort the world market and make it harder for \nU.S. wheat growers to compete.\n  While Australia did not agree to immediate changes to its Wheat \nBoard, it did agree to reverse its position in the Doha Round \nnegotiations and work with the U.S. to mandate global reform of STEs. \nThis is an important step. It further isolates and undermines the Doha \nnegotiating leverage of other countries that use STEs to distort \nagriculture markets.\n  This will particularly help us in our efforts to force reform in \nCanada. Montana wheat producers are affected daily by the distortions \nintroduced into the U.S. market by the Canadian Wheat Board. This part \nof the Australia agreement is thus a very positive development, and a \nclear improvement compared to the status quo.\n  SPS Issues. Finally, I reminded Ambassador Zoellick of the crucial \nneed for Australia to resolve its sanitary and phytosanitary, or SPS, \nbarriers to U.S. products. In response to U.S. concerns, the \nAustralians agreed to resolve SPS disputes as soon as possible. I am \npleased to note that the Australians have made good on this promise in \nthe high-profile dispute over pork. Last month, Australia lifted \nregulatory barriers to U.S. pork. That one action could mean an \nadditional $50 million in U.S. pork exports.\n  U.S. negotiators understood my concerns in this agreement. I thank \nAmbassador Zoellick and his staff--particularly Al Johnson--for \naddressing them.\n  Of course, it would be a mistake to think that free trade agreements \naffect only farmers. For the great swath of American and Montana \nmanufacturing workers hit hard by the more than 3 million jobs lost \nover the past 3 years, this agreement couldn't come at a better time.\n  Australia is one of the few large economies with whom the U.S. enjoys \na trade surplus. With a standard of living higher than Germany, France, \nand even Japan, Australia has one of the most robust and fundamentally \nsound economies in the world. Guaranteed access to a market like this \nis crucial if we are serious about rebuilding the U.S. economy.\n  Industrial trade with Australia is already strong, but with this \nagreement, it will get even stronger. This agreement will eliminate \ntariffs on more than 99 percent of U.S. goods immediately. Mr. \nPresident, 93 percent of current U.S. exports to Australia are \nmanufactured goods, so further economic integration is bound to help \nU.S. manufacturers and U.S. workers.\n  These benefits will extend to all parts of the country. Montana \nindustries already export $3.4 million worth of industrial goods to \nAustralia. This number will only grow higher, as a result of this \nagreement. Montana will benefit not only from increases in direct \nexports, but from increased demand for other goods that require Montana \ninputs.\n  Further benefits would accrue to U.S. exporters from using Australia \nas a platform for more efficient access to Asian markets. This \nagreement will thus provide net benefits across a vast spectrum of the \nU.S. economy--manufacturing, services, investments, and workers.\n  But let me return to how international trade will help U.S. farmers.\n\n[[Page S6797]]\n\nThis is always a fundamental question, particularly for those of us who \nrepresent rural states.\n  As a Montanan, it is hard to talk about international trade without \nthinking about agriculture. Over the years, U.S. agriculture has \nundergone enormous changes, for reasons that are much broader than \nglobalization. The U.S., as a whole, has changed dramatically. Where we \nlive, where we work, the things we make, the technology we use to make \nthings--all of these have changed since our parents' time.\n  We need a rural America that is not only stable and prosperous; we \nneed a rural America that is compatible in the long-term with a 21st \ncentury characterized by mobility and rapid technological advancement. \nWe need a farm economy that is highly adaptive and aggressively focused \non competitiveness.\n  To accomplish this, we need sweeping changes in several areas. We \nwill need more agricultural research--an area suffering from an \nappalling decline in federal support. We will need a farm policy that \nfacilitates, rather than simply underwrites, the farm economy.\n  And we will need a vigilant search for new and growing markets.\n  Of course, many of these needs are beyond the ken of trade policy, \nbut the search for new markets is not. That is why fundamentally we \nneed a strategy that embraces the global trading system.\n  For the U.S. to remain a superpower in agriculture, we must see the \nworld as it is, not as it used to be. That means we need to focus our \nattention on global negotiations that will create real fairness in \nagriculture trade. I share the concern of many about a trade policy \nagenda that focuses too much attention on bilateral agreements, at the \nexpense of our broader efforts in the World Trade Organization.\n  Yet, in the trend toward globalization, the industrial world is \nmoving ahead. We should not allow agriculture to be left behind. \nLeaving agriculture behind in the 20th century trading regime would be \ndisastrous for U.S. farmers, if for no other reason than they are, on \nthe whole, the most productive and technologically advanced in the \nworld. A globalized economy and its institutions are the only forum in \nwhich American farmers' technological advantage is most powerful. \nAmerican agriculture must move ahead to prosper.\n  We cannot shut agriculture out of the globalizing process. We cannot \nsettle for the status quo, hoping that it will sustain us indefinitely. \nAs the rest of the world's agricultural producers rapidly develop, we \ncannot hide behind high tariffs and high subsidies.\n  The U.S. represents only 5 percent of the world's consumers. Yet, in \ncommodity after commodity, we produce far more than Americans can \nconsume. That is true of beef and wheat, for example. And demand from \nour own 5 percent will likely grow much more slowly than demand from \nthe other 95 percent. There are only so many steaks any one well-fed \nAmerican can eat. But in the developing world, demand for food still \nhas much room to grow. The more their wealth grows, the more that \nconsumption patterns will shift from low-cost, starchy foods to high-\nvalue sources of protein such as beef and wheat.\n  We are faced, then, with a simple choice: Either we try to turn back \nthe clock to a time of inferior technology and a more insular world or \nwe seek greater access to the markets of the other 95 percent of the \nworld. The choice is clear.\n  As a nation, we have embarked on a policy of opening markets. This is \na wise policy and a sound one. The fruit of this effort should be more \nand higher-paying jobs for U.S. workers, more abundant choices for our \nconsumers, and greater markets for our farmers and ranchers.\n  Yet, if we are going to sell our products overseas, then we have to \nengage global markets. And we can't do that in a vacuum. This means \nnegotiating trade agreements and fighting the distortions--such as high \ntariffs and high subsidies--that other countries use to undermine our \ncompetitiveness. In that fight, we have no better ally than Australia.\n  At the heart of the matter, engaging global markets means opening \ndoors. And we won't succeed in opening doors to other markets if we \nwon't open our own. We can't insist that China, Thailand, Taiwan, and \nJapan open their markets to our products, if we aren't also willing to \nopen our markets to theirs. And I can't insist that Ambassador Zoellick \naccommodate my concerns in a free trade agreement, if I am not willing \nto offer my support in return.\n  When Ambassador Zoellick announced the administration's intention to \nnegotiate a free trade agreement, many of us harbored concerns that he \nwould negotiate a far different agreement than the one we have before \nus today. But the protections that American negotiators built into this \nagreement are strong. And I congratulate the Trade Representative's \noffice for its skill in negotiating such a tough agreement.\n  Mr. President, I will support the U.S.-Australia free trade \nagreement. I look forward to working with my colleagues to make sure \nthat this agreement is implemented fairly. And I look forward to \nworking with the U.S. Trade Representative to make sure that all trade \nagreements are the best possible deal for Montana.\n  This is the time for engaging our allies and for opening the door to \nnew markets. This is the time for planting the seeds of a greater world \ntrade system. As the American farmer has done down through the \ncenturies, we should labor today for a future of growth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/15/senate-section/article/S6797-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6797]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          RECOGNIZING THE PROFESSIONALISM OF MS.

She is a very quick learner and an extremely hard worker. \nShe adapts quickly to changing circumstances and is always responsive \nto situations. From early bird breakfasts with Pentagon officials to \nlate vote evenings in the Senate, Carol was an invaluable member of my \nlegislative staff and a quick study on the diverse and competing \npriorities that arise in the Senate on a regular basis. Her \nprofessionalism and dedication to getting the job done reflects well on \nthe Defense Supply Center- Philadelphia, an agency within the Defense \nLogistics Agency, where Carol has been employed for the past 22 years.\n  Mr. President, Carol Madonna has many accomplishments that are worthy \nof mention.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the column \n``Empty Words'' by Frank Gaffney, which appears in today's Washington \nTimes, be printed in the Record. I believe that this piece \nappropriately emphasizes the crucial role continued research plays in \nmaintaining the credible nuclear deterrrent of the United States. As \nmore information becomes available regarding covert nuclear programs in \nNorth Korea and Iran, the sustainability and credibility of America's \nnuclear arsenal is of paramount concern.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Times, June 15, 2004]\n\n                              Empty words\n\n                       (By Frank J. Gaffney Jr.)\n\n       The U.S. Senate gets back to work today after a week of \n     bipartisan mourning of Ronald Reagan and tributes to his \n     security policy legacy. It is fitting that the first orders\n\n[[Page S6798]]\n\n     of business will be votes on amendments to repudiate two of \n     the initiatives most central to the Gipper's foreign and \n     defense policy success: the maintenance of a credible and \n     safe nuclear deterrent, and protection of Americans against \n     missile attack.\n       The first effort to reduce last week's Reagan endorsements \n     to empty words will be led by some of the Senate's most \n     liberal Democrats, notably Sens. Edward Kennedy of \n     Massachusetts and Dianne Feinstein of California. They seek \n     to preclude the United States from even researching new \n     nuclear weapons, let alone testing or deploying them.\n       Ronald Reagan hated nuclear weapons as much as anybody. \n     What is more, he seriously worked to rid the world of them. \n     Yet, unlike these legislators, President Reagan understood--\n     until that day--this country must have effective nuclear \n     forces. He was convinced there was no better way to \n     discourage the hostile use of nuclear weapons against us than \n     by ensuring a ready and credible deterrent.\n       Toward that end, Mr. Reagan comprehensively modernized \n     America's strategic forces, involving both new weapons and an \n     array of delivery systems He built two types of intermediate-\n     range nuclear missiles and deployed them to five Western \n     European countries. And, not least, he recognized our \n     deterrent posture depended critically upon a human and \n     physical infrastructure that could design, test, build and \n     maintain the nation's nuclear arsenal. Without such support, \n     America would inexorably be disarmed.\n       In fact, it is no exaggeration to say that, but for Mr. \n     Reagan's nuclear modernization efforts--most of them over the \n     strenuous objections of senators like Mr. Kennedy and John \n     Kerry--we may well not have a viable nuclear deterrent today. \n     Even with his legacy, 15 years of policies more in keeping \n     with the anti-nuclear ``freeze'' movement's nostrums than Mr. \n     Reagan's philosophy of ``peace through strength'' have \n     undermined the deterrent by creeping obsolescence, growing \n     uncertainty about its reliability and safety and loss of \n     infrastructure to ensure its future effectiveness.\n       This is especially worrisome since some of the research in \n     question would explore whether a Robust Nuclear Earth \n     Penetrator (RNEP) could be developed to penetrate deep \n     underground before detonating. Such a capability would allow \n     us to hold at risk some of the 10,000 concealed and hardened \n     command-and-control bunkers, weapons of mass destruction \n     (WMD) production and storage facilities and other buried \n     high-value targets built by potential adversaries.\n       If anything, the absence of a credible American capability \n     to attack such targets may have contributed to rogue states' \n     massive investment in these facilities over the past 15 \n     years. One thing is clear: Our restraint in taking even \n     modest steps to modernize our nuclear deterrent--for example, \n     by designing an RNEP or new, low-yield weapons--has certainly \n     not prevented others from trying to ``get the Bomb.''\n       There is no more reason--Sens. Kennedy, Kerry and \n     Feinstein's arguments to the contrary notwithstanding--to \n     believe continuing our unilateral restraint will discourage \n     our prospective enemies' proliferation in the future.\n       Last September, the Senate recognized this reality, \n     rejecting an earlier Feinstein-Kennedy amendment by a vote of \n     53-41. Five Democrats--Sens. Evan Bayh of Indiana, Fritz \n     Hollings of South Carolina, Zell Miller of Georgia, Ben \n     Nelson of Nebraska and Bill Nelson of Florida--joined \n     virtually every Republican in permitting nuclear weapons \n     research, with the proviso further congressional approval \n     would be required prior to development and production. The \n     prudence of this is even more evident today in light of \n     revelations of covert Iranian and North Korean nuclear \n     activity since last fall.\n       The other assault on the Reagan legacy will be led by \n     Democratic Sens. Carl Levin of Michigan and Jack Reed of \n     Rhode Island. They hope to strip more than $500 million from \n     defense authorization legislation that would buy anti-missile \n     interceptors, the direct descendant of Ronald Reagan's \n     Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI).\n       Just last week, former Gorbachev spokesman Gennadi \n     Gerasimov, reminded the world how mistaken those like Sen. \n     Carl Levin, Michigan Democrat, were when they ridiculed and \n     tried to undermine the Reagan missile defense program: ``I \n     see President Reagan as a gravedigger of the Soviet Union and \n     the spade that he used to prepare this grave was SDI.''\n       Today, there are published reports the U.N. Security \n     Council has been briefed by its inspectors that ballistic \n     missiles and WMD components were slipped out of Iraq before \n     Saddam Hussein was toppled. Such weapons, like some of the \n     thousands of other short-range missiles in arsenals around \n     the world, could find their way into terrorists hands and be \n     launched at this country from ships off our shores.\n       Can there be any doubt but that Ronald Reagan--faced with \n     today's threat of missile attack and the proliferation of \n     nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction--would have \n     been any less resolute in building missile defenses and \n     maintaining our nuclear deterrent than he was in the 1980s? \n     If last week's praise for his visionary leadership two \n     decades ago was not dishonest rhetoric, it should inspire, \n     and guide us all now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/15/senate-section/article/S6798-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6798-S6801]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 BIPARTISAN CAMPAIGN REFORM ACT OF 2002\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, since the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act \nof 2002, BCRA, became law, many of its detractors have mistakenly \nargued that it is ineffective and unworkable. Mr. President, I ask \nunanimous consent that two articles from the Washington Post, an \narticle from the Wall Street Journal, and an article by Anthony \nCorrado, a visiting Fellow at The Brookings Institution, be printed in \nthe Record immediately following my remarks. As these articles \ndescribe, BCRA is having exactly the effect intended. Furthermore, as \nMr. Corrado points out, BCRA did not serve as the death knell for \nAmerica's political parties; their fundraising remains strong.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, June 8, 2004]\n\n     Republican `Soft Money' Groups Find Business Reluctant to Give\n\n                         (By Thomas B. Edsall)\n\n       Republican operatives attempting to compete with Democratic \n     groups for large sums of unregulated presidential campaign \n     funds have run into a number of roadblocks, including \n     reluctance on the part of many corporations to contribute to \n     new independent groups.\n       The Federal Election Commission last month cleared the way \n     for liberal groups to continue raising millions of dollars of \n     unrestricted contributions, and now GOP groups that have held \n     back are joining in. But in a sign of the problems GOP \n     leaders are encountering, one of the key Republican groups, \n     Progress for America, failed in its bid to recruit James \n     Francis Jr. to become chairman.\n       Francis ran the Bush 2000 campaign's ``Pioneer'' program, \n     which produced 246 men and women who each raised at least \n     $100,000. PFA organizers sought out Francis because his close \n     ties to the administration would have lent enormous clout and \n     prestige.\n       ``It gets down to, `What does it look like?' And it might \n     not look like I was independent,'' Francis said, adding that \n     he could have complied with laws requiring total separation \n     from the Bush campaign, but critics would still have raised \n     questions.\n       Meanwhile, election law lawyers said corporations are \n     showing significant reluctance to get back into making ``soft \n     money'' donations after passage of the McCain-Feingold law \n     that went into effect on Nov. 6, 2002.\n       Unlike political committees regulated by the FEC, \n     ``527s''--named for the section of the tax code that governs \n     their activities--have no restrictions on the sources or \n     amount of contributions, and some have received gifts of $5 \n     million or more. Republicans, encountering corporate \n     unwillingness to give to GOP 527s and seeking to capitalize \n     on the Bush campaign's unprecedented fundraising success, \n     urged the FEC to clamp down on the these groups' activities.\n       ``I would say that on the whole the corporate business \n     community has been very reluctant to support 527s,'' said GOP \n     lawyer Jan W. Baran.\n       Kenneth A. Gross, an election lawyer, said he has told his \n     corporate clients ``to proceed with caution.'' Prospective \n     donors of soft money should be sure to get affirmative \n     statements that the organization asking for money will not \n     coordinate activities with federal candidates in violation of \n     the law, and that the organization will abide by the rules \n     governing political communications, he said.\n       Overall, pro-Democratic 527 organizations have raised at \n     least $106.6 million, according to PoliticalMoneyLine, three \n     times the $33.6 million raised by pro-Republican groups in \n     this election cycle.\n       The Democratic advantage disappears, however, when these \n     figures are added to the amounts raised by the national party \n     committees and the presidential campaigns. Then the GOP pulls \n     far ahead, $557.6 million to $393.6 million.\n       Lobbyist and former House member Bill Paxon, who is vice \n     president of the Leadership Forum, a Republican 527, \n     acknowledged that the GOP 527 effort will not be able to \n     match the Democrats'.\n       Paxon said donations in the $25,000 to $50,000 range have \n     started to come in from at least a dozen corporations, \n     including Pfizer Inc., Union Pacific Corp., Bell South Corp. \n     and International Paper Inc. In 2002, those four companies \n     gave far more to Republican Party committees, more than $2.6 \n     million.\n       ``We don't expect to be posting huge numbers at the end of \n     this filing,'' covering the period through the end of June, \n     Paxon said, ``but we have laid the groundwork.''\n       Democrats have set up at least seven new 527 organizations. \n     These groups are on track to raise $175 million to $300 \n     million for ``independent'' issue ads and get-out-the-vote \n     activities.\n       Financier George Soros, Progressive Corp. Chairman Peter B. \n     Lewis and Hollywood writer-producer Stephen L. Bing have each \n     given more than $7 million to such groups as the Media Fund, \n     America Coming Together and MoveOn.org, which are working to \n     defeat President Bush.\n       Privately, organizers of the Republican 527s said they have \n     been banking on an outpouring of corporate support to defray \n     start-up costs and to get their programs up and\n\n[[Page S6799]]\n\n     running. Corporate and union money cannot be spent on \n     television ads mentioning federal candidates for 60 days \n     before the general election, although it can be used for \n     voter mobilization.\n       Signs of corporate wariness toward making soft money \n     contributions could be found in a number of places.\n       After Francis rejected the chairmanship of PFA, a key \n     leadership role has fallen to co-chairman James W. Cicconi, \n     general counsel and executive vice president at AT, but the \n     company has declined to say whether it will give any money to \n     the 527s. ``We have not made a comment about that at all,'' \n     said Claudia B. Jones, director of media relations for AT\n       A Wall Street Journal survey of the 20 top businesses \n     giving soft money before the new law went into effect showed \n     that more than half of the 20 companies are resisting \n     pressure to give, and only one, Bell South, would say \n     affirmatively that it plans to make corporate contributions.\n       Baran said that in addition to corporate wariness toward \n     making soft money contributions, the success of the Bush \n     campaign and the Republican National Committee has worked as \n     a disincentive to giving to the 527s:\n       ``A lot of folks on the business side are looking at the \n     $200 million the Bush campaign has raised, and the millions \n     the RNC has raised, and they aren't sure the funding [of the \n     527s] is all that necessary.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, June 7, 2004]\n\n                   Companies Pare Political Donations\n\n\nRepublicans Feel the Brunt As New `Soft Money' Rules Upend Traditional \n                                 Giving\n\n                          (By Jeanne Cummings)\n\n       Washington.--Republicans are getting a cold shoulder from \n     some of their traditional corporate benefactors, putting them \n     at a fund-raising disadvantage against new, well-financed \n     political organizations touting the Democratic message.\n       A Wall Street Journal survey of the top 20 corporate donors \n     to national political party committees during the 2002 \n     election cycle found that more than half--including the likes \n     of Citigroup Inc., Pfizer Inc. and Microsoft Corp.--are \n     resisting giving big-dollar donations to the new, independent \n     organizations that were created after a 2002 campaign-finance \n     reform law restricted such contributions to the political \n     parties.\n       The reticence illustrates an uneasiness on the part of some \n     of the corporations to get sucked back into the world of \n     unlimited political contributions that they thought campaign \n     reform had left behind. They also seem reluctant to give to \n     untested organizations that are dedicated to partisan \n     political activity, rather than to policy or legislative \n     issues.\n       Their attitude sends a signal that a major source of the \n     ``soft money''--the large and unlimited donations to the \n     national parties that long fed the political system--may have \n     dried up, at least in the short term.\n       ``It reflects what many advocates of reform said: that much \n     of this money was not natural to the political process,'' \n     said Anthony Corrado, a campaign-finance expert at the \n     Brookings Institution.\n       The corporate coyness could be an unexpected fund-raising \n     boon to Democratic presumptive nominee John Kerry, who is \n     enjoying an extraordinary year of fund raising.\n       The big-dollar soft-money contributions were the financial \n     hallmark of past elections, and the flood of such \n     contributions included unregulated and unlimited checks from \n     corporations, labor unions and wealthy individuals. Political \n     parties are barred from accepting soft money under the 2002 \n     law.\n       However, several new political groups, formed outside the \n     parties in the wake of the law, now are seeking those same \n     checks to conduct political projects, such as voter-\n     mobilization efforts and advertising campaigns.\n       The Democrats' soft-money base, largely comprising labor \n     unions and wealthy liberals, has responded readily, \n     depositing $40.5 million in new organizations, which are \n     playing a significant role in the presidential campaign.\n       For instance, the Media Fund, an advertising organization \n     founded by former Clinton aide Harold Ickes, has spent $15 \n     million attacking President Bush or defending Mr. Kerry. \n     America Coming Together, a voter-mobilization group headed by \n     labor turnout guru Steve Rosenthal, has spent nearly $20 \n     million enrolling new voters that could neutralize or best \n     the grass-roots work of the Bush-Cheney operation in swing \n     states.\n       Republicans had hoped the Federal Election Commission would \n     shut down these groups. But the commissioners didn't, and \n     that has Republicans playing catch-up on tough terrain.\n       The corporations contacted by The Wall Street Journal that \n     aren't giving in this cycle made about $21.2 million in \n     contributions to the national parties during the 2002 cycle. \n     More than half of that money went to Republican committees--a \n     sum that would have given the new Republican groups a boost \n     in catching the Democrats.\n       The reluctance of some big companies to give could give \n     cover to other corporations, which collectively contributed \n     $267 million to both parties in the last election cycle--or \n     more than half the $496 million of soft money raised in 2002, \n     according to the Center for Responsive Politics.\n       ``To the extent the big companies use their muscle to \n     reject entreaties by political organization to give money, \n     the medium-size firms will feel that they have a more \n     credible position when they reject them,'' says Nathaniel \n     Persily, a campaign-finance expert at the University of \n     Pennsylvania Law School.\n\n\n                             Old Reliables\n\n       Among the companies not giving to these new organizations, \n     whether they have Democrat or Republican ties, are some of \n     the biggest and most reliable corporate donors to the \n     parties, including Fannie Mae, Verizon Communications Inc. \n     and FedEx Corp. Pfizer's decision to bow out of the process \n     means that another 2002 big giver, Pharmacia Co., is also out \n     of the game, since it has since been sold to Pfizer.\n       Other companies, such as Altria Group Inc. and Freddie Mac, \n     have refused solicitation so far this cycle, but haven't \n     adopted a blanket no-giving policy.\n       Only BellSouth Corp. said it has decided to donate to the \n     groups. AT Corp. and American International Group Inc. \n     refused to say what they plan to do.\n       This corporate attitude doesn't mean Republican groups \n     won't generate substantial sums to finance independent \n     operations; the party has a healthy roster of deep-pocketed \n     individual donors.\n       But executives say it's difficult to justify donations to \n     shareholders because the core missions of these new political \n     groups, at best, are only tangentially connected to the \n     company's legislative and regulatory priorities.\n\n\n                             Track Records\n\n       In contrast, the Republican National Committee and \n     Democratic National Committee had platform policy statements \n     on labor, telecommunications, and tax policy.\n       ``In the past we have given to pre-existing organizations \n     that we could look at their track records'' and how their \n     work advanced the company's priorities, said Misty Skipper, a \n     spokeswoman for CSX Corp. The company's former chairman, John \n     Snow, is President Bush's secretary of the Treasury but so \n     far it has refused solicitations for this election cycle.\n       ``The new organizations are still evolving and that makes \n     it harder to make a detailed analysis, so we will take them \n     on a case-by-case basis,'' said Ms. Skipper.\n       Since the law governing these groups is unsettled, \n     executives say it also raises the risk a corporate donor \n     could get dragged into a political scandal. ``Any time there \n     is a new system put in place there is a lot of uncertainty, \n     and nobody in corporate America likes uncertainty,'' said \n     John Scruggs, vice president for government affairs for \n     Altria, another company that is holding back for now. ``I \n     think everybody would just like to see how all this will work \n     before they make any firm decisions.''\n       Perhaps the biggest reason for the reluctance is many \n     executives felt the soft-money system amounted to extortion \n     of private businesses. ``It was bad for the country and bad \n     for the political system. And what's bad for the political \n     system is only bad for business,'' said Edward A. Kangas, \n     retired chairman of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu who led the \n     corporate fight for passage of the 2002 reform law.\n       Businesses may open their wallets in future campaign \n     cycles, and they are still contributing to party conventions \n     and a few party entities exempt from the ban, including the \n     Democratic and Republican governors associations.\n       The chilly reception the new outside organizations are \n     receiving from corporate donors is prompting one of the \n     leading Republican groups, Progress for America, to \n     concentrate its efforts on soliciting wealthy individuals, \n     says President Brian McCabe.\n       Former Congressman Bill Paxon, who leads the Leadership \n     Forum, an organization associated with the Republican House \n     caucus, said flatly: ``We will not have the total number of \n     resources the Democrats have.''\n       Still, the Leadership Forum has assembled lobbyists and \n     influential Republicans committed to raising $25,000 apiece. \n     Next month, it will hold a fund-raising event featuring House \n     Speaker Dennis Hastert.\n       But the House leadership's embrace of the forum caught the \n     eye of watchdog organizations monitoring possible violations \n     of the law's ban on coordination with elected officials. ``We \n     will be filing new complaints,'' said Fred Wertheimer, a \n     leading reformer.\n\n\n                          CORPORATE RELUCTANCE\n\n       Former corporate soft-money donors are declining to give to \n     new independent political groups seeking the big checks that \n     parties cannot accept anymore.\n       Who's Giving: BellSouth.\n       Who's not giving: AFLAC; Altria Group; BlueCross and \n     BlueShield; Citigroup; CSX; Eli Lilly; Fannie Mae; Freddie \n     Mac; Lockheed Martin; Microsoft; Pfizer; and Verizon.\n     Source: WSJ research.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, June 4, 2004]\n\n                    A Better Campaign Finance System\n\n                          (By E.J. Dionne Jr.)\n\n       Pity the poor campaign finance reformers. All their dreams \n     are supposedly going up in smoke.\n       After all, both President Bush and Sen. John Kerry passed \n     up federal matching funds in the primaries so they could \n     raise record sums of private money. Groups theoretically \n     independent of the parties have run millions of dollars worth \n     of ads, often using huge donations from the very rich. Kerry \n     considered declining to accept the Democratic nomination at \n     his party's convention in July so he\n\n[[Page S6800]]\n\n     could have an extra month to raise and spend private money.\n       Critics of reform see these developments as signs of a \n     loopy system. In fact, the 2004 campaign will be remembered \n     as one in which the political money system became more \n     democratic and more open. Small contributors have more \n     influence this year. Big contributors have less. Those new \n     big-money political committees are getting a lot of attention \n     because they are now the exception rather than the rule.\n       Does this mean that the new system pushed through by John \n     McCain and Russ Feingold in the Senate and Chris Shays and \n     Marty Meehan in the House has brought forth perfection? Of \n     course not. Their law was simply a first but important step.\n       Thanks to the new law, candidates for the presidency, the \n     House and the Senate are not themselves out soliciting \n     unlimited contributions from rich and well-connected people \n     or from big corporations. A lot of business guys are relieved \n     that politicians considering bills that affect their \n     companies aren't on the phone suggesting that it would be \n     awfully nice to see them and their corporate checkbooks at \n     the next ``soft money'' fundraiser.\n       The hope of McCain-Feingold was to create a more broadly \n     based political money system--more people contributing in \n     smaller amounts. Partly because of the law and partly because \n     of the inventiveness of political entrepreneurs such as \n     Zephyr Teachout, Howard Dean's director of online organizing, \n     that is what is happening.\n       Dean began the democratizing process during the primary \n     campaign by creating a base of tens of thousands of small \n     donors. Kerry got the Dean message. He started peppering his \n     speeches with references to ``JohnKerry.com'' and asking for \n     donations. (Bush, in fairness, can be reached at \n     GeorgeWBush.com.)\n       Kerry then proceeded to break all Democratic Party records, \n     raising more than $117 million at last count.\n       The Kerry Web site recently featured Cathy Weigel of North \n     Kansas City, Mo., as its 1 millionth online contributor. For \n     a mere $50 contribution, Weigel got a call from Kerry and a \n     promise of ``a great seat at the Inauguration and a prime \n     visit to the White House.'' Such calls and promises used to \n     go to big soft-money fundraisers who bagged a million or so \n     in contributions.\n       Yes, problems persist. They always will in this imperfect \n     world. By failing to regulate the ``527'' political \n     committees (named after the section of the tax code they are \n     organized under), the Federal Election Commission needlessly \n     opened a loophole that could push the system back toward big \n     money. This loophole won't destroy the entire law. Under \n     McCain-Feingold, outside groups will have to operate on \n     smaller contributions starting two months before the \n     election. But the loophole should still be closed.\n       The system regulating presidential primaries is entirely \n     antiquated, one reason Bush and Kerry both dropped out of it. \n     It worked well for a long time, but now it needs fixing.\n       It's absurd that simply by delaying his party's convention \n     into September, Bush gave himself not only an extra month \n     more than Kerry to raise private money but also a leg up \n     afterward. In the general election campaign, Kerry will have \n     to stretch the $75 million he gets in public money over three \n     months; Bush will have the same amount to spend in just two \n     months.\n       The system needs stronger incentives to encourage \n     candidates to base their campaigns on small contributions. \n     Tax credits could cover the cost of providing candidates free \n     airtime. And federal candidates should get the ``clean \n     money'' option that allows politicians in Arizona and Maine \n     to virtually eschew private fundraising. Those clean-money \n     plans have given new people a chance to enter politics \n     without mortgaging their houses or their souls.\n       Those who would abandon all efforts to limit money's \n     influence on politics are urging that we live with \n     plutocracy. By indiscriminately pronouncing even successful \n     reform efforts as failures, reform's foes are trying to \n     undermine any attempt to make politics a little more honest, \n     a little less subject to the whims of the wealthy, a little \n     more democratic. The nation's campaign money system is still \n     flawed. But it's better than it used to be.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               [May 2004]\n\n  National Party Fundraising Remains Strong, Despite Ban on Soft Money\n\n                          (By Anthony Corrado)\n\n       The national party committees continue to outpace the \n     fundraising totals set in the 2000 election cycle, despite \n     the ban on soft money. The latest totals suggest that the \n     national committees are adapting successfully to the new \n     fundraising restrictions imposed by the Bipartisan Campaign \n     Reform Act (BCRA), more commonly known as McCain-Feingold, \n     and that they will have the resources needed to mount \n     meaningful campaigns on behalf of their candidates in the \n     fall election. Moreover, the parties have demonstrated \n     financial strength despite the unprecedented fundraising \n     efforts of their presumptive presidential nominees and \n     unrestricted fundraising by so-called 527 committees and \n     other nonparty organizations in the quest for campaign \n     dollars in the hotly contested race for the White House.\n       After 15 months in the 2004 election cycle, the national \n     parties have raised a total of $433 million in hard money \n     alone, compared to $373 million in hard and soft money \n     combined at this point in the 2000 campaign. Every one of the \n     six national committees has substantially increased its hard \n     dollar fundraising in response to the ban on soft money. The \n     Republican committees have replaced all of the $86 million in \n     soft money they had solicited by March of 2000 with hard \n     dollar contributions subject to federal limits. The \n     Democratic committees, which were much more dependent on soft \n     money than their Republican counterparts, raising more than \n     half of their funds from soft contributions at this point in \n     2000, have already replaced most of their soft money receipts \n     with new hard dollar contributions.\n       This surge in national party fundraising is the result of a \n     substantial increase in the number of individual contributors \n     that have been added to party rolls. While the higher \n     contribution limits for national party committees adopted \n     under BCRA (up to $57,500 per person every two years) have \n     produced millions of additional dollars for these committees, \n     the vast majority of the increase in party hard money \n     receipts is a result of the extraordinary growth in the \n     number of small donors on both sides of the aisle.(1) No \n     longer able to solicit unlimited soft money donations, the \n     parties are investing more resources in direct mail, \n     telemarketing, and Internet fundraising, with notable success \n     in soliciting small contributions of less than $200. The RNC, \n     which for decades has had the largest donor base of any of \n     the party committees, has added more than a million new \n     donors to its rolls since 2001.(2) The NRCC, in 2003 alone, \n     recruited more than 400,000 new contributors.(3) The DNC has \n     increased its number of direct mail donors from 400,000 in \n     2001 to more than 1.2 million so far in 2004, and increased \n     its number of email addresses from 70,000 to more than 3 \n     million. In the first four months of this year, the DNC \n     posted 35 million pieces of fundraising mail, which, \n     according to DNC Chairman Terry McAuliffe, exceeded the \n     amount of fundraising mail posted by the committee ``in \n     the entire decade of the 1990s.''(4)\n       As anticipated by most observers, the Republicans have \n     proved to be more successful in raising hard dollars than the \n     Democrats, outraising the Democrats by a margin of two-to-one \n     and increasing the fundraising gap between the parties. \n     Overall, the Republican committees collected $288 million \n     during the course of the first 15 months of this cycle, as \n     compared to $216 million in hard and soft money combined four \n     years ago. The Democratic committees took in $145 million, as \n     compared to $157 million in hard and soft money combined four \n     years ago. The Republicans have more than doubled last \n     cycle's hard money total, while the Democrats have almost \n     doubled their hard money receipts, increasing their take by \n     89 percent. The most recent quarter, however, suggests that \n     the Democrats' investments in small donor fundraising are \n     paying off and that the party may be beginning to narrow the \n     gap. In the first quarter of this election year, the \n     Democrats received $50 million as opposed to $82 million by \n     the Republicans, and recent reports suggest that fundraising \n     on the Democratic side continues to strengthen.(5)\n       Even so, the Republicans have increased their financial \n     advantage as compared to four years ago, when the Democrats \n     controlled the White House. The gap has grown from about $59 \n     million to $143 million. The Republicans are therefore likely \n     to have an even greater financial advantage over the \n     Democrats than they did four years ago. In 2000, the \n     Republican national party committees received approximately \n     $346 million in hard money, as opposed to $204 million for \n     their Democratic opponents.\n       The gap between Republicans and Democrats is much narrower \n     in terms of cash available to spend in the months ahead. As \n     of the end of March, the Republican committees had almost $86 \n     million of net cash available to spend, led by the RNC, which \n     has a cash balance of $54 million. The Democrats had $43 \n     million available to spend, led by the DNC, which had $27 \n     million in cash. The expenditure-to-cash ratios for each \n     party are now roughly equivalent, with the Republicans \n     raising twice as much as the Democrats and generating twice \n     as much net cash.\n       When BCRA was adopted, many observers expressed concern \n     that the law would weaken the parties by depriving them of \n     the resources needed to mount viable campaigns on behalf of \n     their candidates. Yet, to date, the parties have proven that \n     they can effectively adjust to a hard money world. They have \n     altered their strategies and ended their reliance on soft \n     money, replacing large soft money donations with thousands of \n     small individual gifts.\n       The rise of a number of federal-election-related 527 \n     organizations, which are not wholly subject to federal \n     contribution limits and may raise funds from unlimited \n     sources in unlimited amounts, has not dimmed the resources \n     available to the parties. So far, the monies raised and spent \n     by these committees represents only a portion of the monies \n     the party committees have received, and a relatively small \n     share of the total resources spent so far in this year's \n     federal elections. In the first 15 months of this cycle, the \n     national parties raised $433 million. State and local party \n     committees collected more than $94 million for federal \n     election activity, including $59 million by Republican \n     committees and $35 million by Democratic committees. The \n     presidential contenders, George Bush and John Kerry, took in \n     more than $270 million. Congressional candidates garnered\n\n[[Page S6801]]\n\n     $583 million, or 35 percent more than they raised at this \n     point two years ago.(6) The major new 527 organizations \n     active in federal elections in the aftermath of BCRA (Joint \n     Victory Committee 2004, Media Fund, Americans Coming \n     Together, MoveOn.org, and America Votes) raised slightly more \n     than $47 million, while Club for Growth, a conservative \n     group, generated more than $5 million.(7)\n       To what extent this will change in the aftermath of the \n     FEC's May 13 decision to defer immediate action on proposed \n     regulations for 527 groups remains to be seen. But it now \n     appears that the parties are benefiting from the deep \n     partisan divide within the country and the high level of \n     competition in the presidential race, which is spurring tens \n     of thousands of individuals to contribute to their preferred \n     party for the first time. This suggests that the funds spent \n     by nonparty groups will supplement, rather than overshadow, \n     the role of the parties in 2004.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/15/senate-section/article/S6801-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6801]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        TRIBUTE TO BETTY STRONG\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, earlier this month, Sioux City, IA, \nlost one of its most passionate and beloved community leaders, Betty \nStrong.\n  Betty was an adopted daughter of Iowa--she was born and raised in \nMissouri--but she became a true Iowan, through and through. She moved \nto Sioux City in 1953, and for the next half century she worked \ntirelessly for her community and as an activist in the Democratic \nParty. She was one of those people who always strove to make a positive \ndifference in the lives of those around her, and Betty succeeded \nmagnificently.\n  Betty's understanding and passion for politics made her an invaluable \nparticipant in countless State, local, and national campaigns. She was \na delegate for Vice President Walter Mondale at the 1984 Democratic \nNational Convention, and participated in Senator Joseph Biden's 1988 \nPresidential campaign in Iowa. In 2000, she coordinated Iowans for \nGore.\n  I met Betty more than 20 years ago and she quickly became a very dear \nfriend and trusted political counselor. She was my chief supporter and \norganizer in Sioux City during my first campaign for the Senate.\n  In 1976, Betty became the first woman to be elected chairperson of \nthe Woodbury County Democratic Party, and she also served on a variety \nof other local Democratic and women's organizations.\n  Betty's tireless organizing and campaigning in the late 1980s helped \nto win the vote to build four new high schools and a juvenile detention \ncenter in Sioux City. From 1989 until her death, Betty served as the \npresident of the Missouri River Historical Development Inc., a \nnonprofit group that built the $4 million Sioux City Lewis and Clark \nInterpretive Center. Betty was very proud of that center, which, she \nsaid, ``brings history alive for people of all ages.''\n  The list of Betty's accomplishments runs long, and is a testament to \nall she has done to better the lives of the people around her. She was \ninvolved in politics for all the right reasons. She wasn't seeking \nfame. She simply wanted a government that worked for all people. Betty \nStrong embodied the qualities and spirit that people in my State \ncherish.\n  Our thoughts and prayers go out to Betty's husband Darrell, their \nchildren Sharon, Jackie, and Marvin, and their spouses. Iowans are \ndeeply indebted to Betty for her devotion to public service. We will \nmiss her greatly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/15/senate-section/article/S6801-2", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6801]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/15/senate-section/article/S6801-3", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6801]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/15/senate-section/article/S6801-4", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6801]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   NOTIFICATION OF THE PRESIDENT'S INTENT TO ENTER INTO A FREE TRADE \n            AGREEMENT WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF BAHRAIN--PM 86\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Finance:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Consistent with section 2105(a)(1)(A) of the Trade Act of 2002, \n(Public Law 107-210; the ``Trade Act''), I am pleased to notify the \nCongress of my intent to enter into a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with \nthe Government of Bahrain.\n  This agreement will create new opportunities for America's workers, \nfarmers, businesses, and consumers by eliminating barriers in trade \nwith Bahrain.

INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Ms. MIKULSKI (for herself, Mrs. Hutchison, Ms. Cantwell, Ms. \n        Snowe, Mrs. Feinstein, Ms. Collins, Mrs. Murray, Mrs. Dole, Ms. \n        Landrieu, Ms. Murkowski, Mrs. Lincoln, Mrs. Clinton, Ms. \n        Stabenow, and Mrs. Boxer):\n  S. 2519. A bill to authorize assistance for education and health care \nfor women and children in Iraq during the reconstruction of Iraq and \nthereafter, to authorize assistance for the enhancement of political \nparticipation, economic empowerment, civil society, and personal \nsecurity for women in Iraq, to state the sense of Congress on the \npreservation and protection of the human rights of women and children \nin Iraq, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am proud to join with my colleague \nSenator Kay Bailey Hutchison--and the 12 other women of the United \nStates Senate--to introduce the Iraqi Women's and Children's Liberation \nAct. This legislation authorizes the President to give education, \nhealth care benefits and other help to the women and children of Iraq, \nincluding ensuring the political participation of women in a new \ndemocratic Iraq.\n  Before Saddam Hussein came to power, Iraq was the progressive center \nof the Middle East. In the 1940s, Iraqi women were lawyers, physicians, \nteachers, professors, engineers, scientists, prominent writers, artists \nand poets. By the late 1950's, women in Iraq enjoyed political freedoms \nwith equal protections under the law and the right to vote.\n  Under Saddam Hussein, all that changed. Women lost opportunities for \neducation. They were forced out of the work force. Women and children \ndid not have access to health care. The personal rights of women were \nseverely restricted or ignored as Saddam's government sanctioned \n``honor killings'' and rape as a tool of oppression.\n  The facts speak for themselves. Today, women make up only 17 percent \nof the Iraqi workforce. Only 29 percent of Iraqi girls attend high \nschool. Illiteracy among Iraqi women is an astronomical 77 percent, \ncompared to 45 percent for men. Death during childbirth or from \npregnancy related complications is the leading cause of death of Iraqi \nwomen. Health organizations estimate that 90 percent of these deaths \nare preventable. Right now, 25 percent of the children under the age of \n5 in Iraq are malnourished and 1 in 8 dies even before they reach that \nage.\n  As America works to help the Iraqi people build a free and democratic \nnation, it is vitally important that education and health care for \nwomen and children are assured. If we are helping create a new \ngovernment, let us insist that there not be the old rules, the old \nrepression.\n  Of equal importance is ensuring that women have a seat at the table \nin a new Iraqi government. Full political participation by women is the \nbest insurance that women's rights will be respected now and in the \nfuture.\n  These are the two important components of our legislation: first, it \nauthorizes the President to provide education and health care \nassistance for the women and children living in Iraq and to women and \nchildren of Iraq who are refugees in other countries. When our own \ngovernment and the NGOs come in, they should focus significant efforts \non making sure women and children have access to education and health \ncare. They should also do their best to partner with and build the \ncapacity of local NGOs to strengthen Iraq's civil society.\n  Second, it authorizes the President to provide assistance enhancing \nthe political participation, economic empowerment and personal security \nof Iraqi women. For Iraq to truly be liberated, its women must have a \nvoice in the new political and governmental institutions.\n  This legislation is really about opportunity-making sure the women \nand children in Iraq have the opportunity to live productive lives and \nfulfill their potential, and making sure Iraq has the opportunity to \nsucceed as a democratic nation by tapping the talents of all its \ncitizens. The road to opportunity starts with access to health care so \nchildren can thrive and women can raise healthy families. It continues \nwith education to gain the skills and knowledge necessary to support \nthat family and contribute to society as a whole. One of the most \nimportant ways to contribute to society is through political \nparticipation--whether that means voting, running for office, working \nin a government agency, or organizing for a cause or a community.\n\n[[Page S6806]]\n\n  While building the physical infrastructure in Iraq--things like \nroads, bridges, and power plants--is important, we also need to focus \non the social infrastructure that protects women and children and \nbuilds hope and opportunity. That is the goal of this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2519\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Iraqi Women and Children's \n     Liberation Act of 2004''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) For more than 600 years under the Ottoman Empire, women \n     in Iraq were kept inside their homes, repressed, and \n     forbidden to be seen in public without a related male escort.\n       (2) The Sevres Treaty of 1919, following World War I, \n     installed a new monarchy in Iraq under which education for \n     boys and girls flourished.\n       (3) Within a span of 20 years, 6 centuries of repression of \n     women in Iraq was reversed. Thousands of women in Iraq became \n     lawyers, physicians, educators, teachers, professors, \n     engineers, prominent writers, artists, and poets, \n     demonstrating the impact of progressive policies on the \n     ability of women in Iraq to achieve.\n       (4) In 1941, women in Iraq earned equal wages for equal \n     jobs, an achievement still not duplicated in most parts of \n     the world.\n       (5) On July 14, 1958, the monarchy in Iraq was overthrown \n     by General Abdul-Karim Kasim, who enfranchised women in Iraq \n     with political rights.\n       (6) In 1959, Iraq became the first country in the Middle \n     East to have a female minister, four female judges, prominent \n     scientists, politicians, and freedom fighters.\n       (7) The 1959 Code of Personal Status secularized the multi-\n     ethnic state of Iraq. Women enjoyed political and economic \n     rights, successfully participating in the workforce as well \n     as advancing in the political sphere. Women had the right to \n     receive an education and work outside the home. Women were \n     career military officers, oil-project designers, and \n     construction supervisors, and had government jobs in \n     education, medicine, accounting, and general administration.\n       (8) The Code of Personal Status also granted women \n     extensive legal protections. It gave women the right to vote \n     and granted equal status to men and women under the law. It \n     prohibited marriage by persons under the age of 18 years, \n     arbitrary divorce, and male favoritism in child custody and \n     property inheritance disputes.\n       (9) The regime of Saddam Hussein regularly used rape and \n     sexual violation of women to control information and suppress \n     opposition in Iraq and tortured and killed female dissidents \n     and female relatives of male dissidents.\n       (10) The Department of State has reported that more than \n     200 women in Iraq were beheaded by units of ``Fedayeen \n     Saddaam'', a paramilitary organization headed by Uday \n     Hussein.\n       (11) After the 1990 invasion of Kuwait, the regime of \n     Saddam Hussein imposed policies that resulted in severe \n     economic hardship, discrimination, impoverishment, and \n     oppression of women in Iraq. Many women were prevented from \n     working. Presently, women comprise as much as 65 percent of \n     the population of Iraq, but only 19 percent of the workforce.\n       (12) Men who killed female relatives in ``honor killings'' \n     were protected from prosecution for murder under Article 111 \n     of the Iraqi Penal Code enacted in 1990. The United Nations \n     Special Rapporteur on Violence Against Women has reported \n     that since the enactment of that article, more than 4,000 \n     women were killed for tarnishing the honor of their families, \n     with the killings occurring by a range of methods that \n     included stoning.\n       (13) Maternal mortality is the leading cause of death among \n     women of reproductive age in Iraq, and it continues to rise \n     due to lack of basic health care. The maternal mortality rate \n     in Iraq of 292 deaths per 100,000 live births compared with a \n     maternal mortality rate in the United States of 8 deaths per \n     100,000 live births. 90 percent of the maternal deaths in \n     Iraq are identified as preventable.\n       (14) More than 48 percent of the population of Iraq is \n     under the age of 18 years. One in four children of the age of \n     5 years or younger is chronically malnourished. One in eight \n     children dies before the age of 5 years, the highest rate of \n     mortality among children under that age in the region. Some \n     estimate the total rate of child mortality in Iraq to be as \n     high as 13 percent.\n       (15) Girls and women in Iraq have meager educational \n     opportunities relative to the opportunities available to men \n     and boys in Iraq, and twice as many boys as girls in Iraq \n     attend school. 29 percent of females attend secondary school \n     as compared with 47 percent of males. The illiteracy rate in \n     Iraq is the highest in the Arab world at 61 percent for the \n     general population, 77 percent for women, and 45 percent for \n     men.\n       (16) Press accounts indicate that many women in Iraq are \n     being pressured to adhere to strict Islamic codes that \n     restrict their mobility and impinge on their human rights.\n       (17) Security for women in Iraq is an issue of grave \n     concern. Women are afraid to leave their homes or to send \n     their daughters to school.\n       (18) Women in leadership positions in Iraq are vulnerable \n     to attack. One of the three women on the Iraqi Governing \n     Council was assassinated, and another has a $2,000,000 bounty \n     on her head.\n       (19) Women from the autonomous Kurdish region travel \n     freely, hold important jobs and political positions, and \n     perform a key role in the revival of the areas of Iraq that \n     have been under Kurdish control. The integration of women in \n     the economic and political spheres of the region provides a \n     contrast to the rest of Iraq and serves as an example of what \n     is possible in Iraq.\n       (20) According to the 2003 Arab Human Development Report of \n     the United Nations, pervasive exclusion of women from the \n     political, economic, and social spheres hampers development \n     and growth in Arab countries.\n       (21) Ambassador L. Paul Bremer, the Presidential Envoy to \n     Iraq, has voiced his support of women in Iraq in stating that \n     ``[w]e in the coalition are committed to continuing to \n     promote women's rights in Iraq.''\n       (22) Women have participated in planning for Iraq's \n     political future in the following way:\n       (A) 3 out of 25 people on the Iraqi Governing Council are \n     women.\n       (B) One of the government ministries is led by a woman. 16 \n     of the 25 deputy minister positions are held by women.\n       (C) 15 of the 1,000 nationally-appointed judges are women.\n       (23) Resolution 137 was adopted in a closed session \n     (sponsored by conservative Shiite members) on December 29, \n     2003, with the intent of reversing family law. The adoption \n     of that resolution threatened negative impacts on the rights \n     of women to education, employment, mobility, property \n     inheritance, divorce, and child custody.\n       (24) Ambassador Bremer, who has veto power, stated that he \n     would not sign Resolution 137 into law.\n       (25) The Iraqi Governing Council revoked Resolution 137 on \n     February 27, 2004, in part due to pressure from women's \n     groups. However some members of the Governing Council walked \n     out to protest this action.\n       (26) The Transitional Administrative Law (TAL) that \n     establishes the framework for the interim government of Iraq \n     was officially signed on March 8, 2004. It aims to achieve a \n     goal of having women constitute not less than 25 percent of \n     the members of Iraq's interim legislature. It does not \n     express a goal for a representation rate for women in the \n     executive or judicial branch of the interim government. It \n     also provides that Sharia, the Islamic law, can be a source, \n     but not the only source, of Iraqi law.\n       (27) United States officials propose to turn over political \n     power to Iraqis on June 30, 2004. Some factions have already \n     voiced strong objection to the TAL and could press ahead with \n     their goal of making Sharia the supreme law of Iraq.\n\n     SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the United States should ensure that women and children \n     in Iraq benefit from the liberation of Iraq from the regime \n     of Saddam Hussein;\n       (2) women of all ethnic groups in Iraq should be included \n     in the economic and political reconstruction of Iraq;\n       (3) women should be involved in the drafting and review of \n     the key legal instruments, especially the constitution, of \n     the emerging nation in Iraq in order to ensure that the \n     transition to that nation does not involve or facilitate the \n     erosion of the rights of women in Iraq;\n       (4) women should have membership in any legislature or \n     other committee, body, or structure convened to advance the \n     reconstruction of Iraq that builds on the goal provided for \n     in the Transitional Administrative Law;\n       (5) women should have a similar level of representation in \n     leadership posts in all levels of government in Iraq, \n     including ministers and judges, whether local or national, \n     and women should be integrated in all levels of political \n     process in Iraq, especially the building of political \n     parties;\n       (6) the presence of women on the Iraqi Governing Council \n     should better represent the percentage of women in the \n     general population of Iraq;\n       (7) the participation and contribution of women to the \n     economy of Iraq should be fostered by awarding contracts and \n     sub-contracts to women and women-led businesses and by \n     ensuring the availability of credit for women;\n       (8) continued emphasis and support should be granted to \n     grass-roots organization and civil society building in Iraq, \n     with special emphasis on organizing, mobilizing, educating, \n     training, and building the capacities of women and ensuring \n     the incorporation of their voices in decision-making in Iraq;\n       (9) the security needs of women in Iraq should be addressed \n     and special emphasis placed on recruiting and training women \n     for the police force in Iraq; and\n       (10) the Government of Iraq should adhere to \n     internationally accepted standards on human rights and rights \n     of women and children.\n\n[[Page S6807]]\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to increase \nthe maximum amount of home loan guaranty available under the home loan \nguaranty program of the Department of Veterans Affairs, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation to \nincrease the VA home loan guaranty so that veterans participating in \nthe program may secure a mortgage comparable to what they could obtain \nin the conventional mortgage market.\n  The VA home loan guaranty program, which Congress created in 1944, \nhas assisted millions of veterans--many of whom missed the opportunity \nto accumulate savings or build credit during their time of service--\npurchase a home. Under the program, an eligible veteran may purchase a \nhome through a private lender and the VA guarantees to pay the lender a \nportion of the losses if the veteran defaults on the loan.\n  Unfortunately, the VA currently only guarantees a maximum of $60,000 \non a loan. This means, effectively, that a lender will only loan four \ntimes the amount of the guaranty, or $240,000, to a veteran seeking a \nhome loan.\n  While a loan of this size is sufficient to assist many veterans in \npurchasing a home, it is insufficient for many other veterans, \nparticularly those living in high cost areas, like my state of New \nJersey. In most places in my State, the cost of purchasing a home \nexceeds $240,000. For example, the median home sale price is Newark, \nNew Jersey in 2003, was $331,200. In Middlesex, Hunterdon, and \nSomerset, the median sales price in 2003, was $314,000.\n  Thus, unfortunately for many veterans living in these high cost \nareas, the VA home loan program is inaccessible because the guaranty is \nso low.\n  My legislation would increase the VA guaranty to 25 percent of the \nFreddie Mac conforming loan limit, or $83,425. With such an increase, a \nparticipating veteran could borrow up to $333,700--which is the \nconventional loan limit--towards the purchase of a home. And, because \nFreddie Mac updates its conforming loan limit annually to account for \nchanges in average housing prices, pegging the VA home loan guaranty to \nthis index would ensure that the guaranty and available mortgage limits \nrise with housing inflation.\n  My legislation, which the House Veterans Affairs Committee recently \napproved, would ensure that more veterans have a chance at the American \nDream of owning a home. What is more, my legislation would not cost the \nU.S. Treasury a cent. In fact, according to the Congressional Budget \nOffice (CBO), it would raise approximately $42 million a year, through \nincreased user fees associated with the VA home loan program.\n  This legislation is simple, it's cost effective, and it would assist \nour veterans, who have traded years of traditional employment to serve \nour country, purchase a home. I hope that my colleagues will join me in \nsupporting this important piece of legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2522\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the national flood insurance program--\n       (A) identifies the flood risk;\n       (B) provides flood risk information to the public;\n       (C) encourages State and local governments to make \n     appropriate land use adjustments to constrict the development \n     of land\n\n[[Page S6810]]\n\n     which is exposed to flood damage and minimize damage caused \n     by flood losses; and\n       (D) makes flood insurance available on a nationwide basis \n     that would otherwise not be available, to accelerate recovery \n     from floods, mitigate future losses, save lives, and reduce \n     the personal and national costs of flood disasters;\n       (2) the national flood insurance program insures \n     approximately 4,400,000 policyholders;\n       (3) approximately 48,000 properties currently insured under \n     the program have experienced, within a 10-year period, 2 or \n     more flood losses where each such loss exceeds the amount \n     $1,000;\n       (4) approximately 10,000 of these repetitive-loss \n     properties have experienced either 2 or 3 losses that \n     cumulatively exceed building value or 4 or more losses, each \n     exceeding $1,000;\n       (5) repetitive-loss properties constitute a significant \n     drain on the resources of the national flood insurance \n     program, costing about $200,000,000 annually;\n       (6) repetitive-loss properties comprise approximately 1 \n     percent of currently insured properties but are expected to \n     account for 25 to 30 percent of claims losses;\n       (7) the vast majority of repetitive-loss properties were \n     built before local community implementation of floodplain \n     management standards under the program and thus are eligible \n     for subsidized flood insurance;\n       (8) while some property owners take advantage of the \n     program allowing subsidized flood insurance without requiring \n     mitigation action, others are trapped in a vicious cycle of \n     suffering flooding, then repairing flood damage, then \n     suffering flooding, without the means to mitigate losses or \n     move out of harm's way;\n       (9) mitigation of repetitive-loss properties through \n     buyouts, elevations, relocations, or flood-proofing will \n     produce savings for policyholders under the program and for \n     Federal taxpayers through reduced flood insurance losses and \n     reduced Federal disaster assistance;\n       (10) a strategy of making mitigation offers aimed at high-\n     priority repetitive-loss properties and shifting more of the \n     burden of recovery costs to property owners who choose to \n     remain vulnerable to repetitive flood damage can encourage \n     property owners to take appropriate actions that reduce loss \n     of life and property damage and benefit the financial \n     soundness of the program;\n       (11) the method for addressing repetitive-loss properties \n     should be flexible enough to take into consideration \n     legitimate circumstances that may prevent an owner from \n     taking a mitigation action; and\n       (12) focusing the mitigation and buy-out of repetitive loss \n     properties upon communities and property owners that choose \n     to voluntarily participate in a mitigation and buy-out \n     program will maximize the benefits of such a program, while \n     minimizing any adverse impact on communities and property \n     owners.\n\n           TITLE I--AMENDMENTS TO FLOOD INSURANCE ACT OF 1968\n\n     SEC. 101.

Mr. President, I would first like to acknowledge the \nleadership of Senator Bunning in crafting this legislation. In \naddition, several members of the Banking Committee, from both sides of \nthe aisle, are co-sponsors on S. 2238. The Banking Committee \nunanimously voted to favorably report S. 2238 on March 30, 2004. This \nhas truly been a bipartisan effort.\n  This is important legislation that will go a long way in bringing the \nflood insurance fund toward financial soundness, while protecting \nexisting property owners. The pilot program established in Section 102 \nwill help to address the mitigation of severe repetitive loss \nproperties. These properties, while only a small percentage of insured \nproperties, constitute a large share of claims paid. FEMA estimates \nthat while repetitive loss properties only account for approximately 1 \npercent of all insured properties, these properties account for over 30 \npercent of amounts paid in claims. In addition, most of these \nproperties were constructed before the development of flood insurance \nrate maps, and are paying subsidized rates for flood insurance.\n  S. 2238 provides an additional $40 million annually for mitigation \nactivities. This additional funding will allow families that have lived \nthrough several floods and suffered substantial harm, both financial \nand emotional, to either flood-proof their home or have their home \nbought-out.\n  I also want to commend Senator Sarbanes for his efforts. Title II of \nS. 2238 is largely his creation. I believe Title II will ensure that \nfamilies displaced by floods receive adequate and timely assistance.\n  The managers' amendment to S. 2238 represents several technical and \nconforming changes. First the definition of repetitive loss property is \nnarrowed. This change was made to assure concerned parties that the \npilot program would be targeted at those properties that have indeed \nsuffered the greatest\n\n[[Page S6814]]\n\nlosses. The managers' amendment also clarifies the funding allocation \nof the additional mitigation dollars that will be provided under the \npilot program. A more explicit allocation is needed to insure that \nthose States hit hardest by flooding receive an adequate flow of \nfunding. The managers' amendment also extends the pilot program and the \nNational Flood Insurance Program until September 30, 2009.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I support the passage of S. 2238, as \namended, and want to urge my colleagues to support this critical \nlegislation which ensures the continuation of the National Flood \nInsurance Program, which covers over 4.4 million properties around the \ncountry. Unless we quickly act to reauthorize this program, it will \nexpire at the end of this month. In addition to extending the National \nFlood Insurance Program for 5 years, this bill establishes a loss \nmitigation pilot program to help mitigate flood risks for properties \nthat have been flooded numerous times.\n  This bill has been drafted in a bipartisan manner, and I particularly \nwant to thank Senators Bunning and Shelby for working collaboratively \nwith me to craft this legislation and also for accepting my amendment \nwhich makes a number of administrative changes to the National Flood \nInsurance Program designed to strengthen the program and ensure that \nflood victims can fairly and adequately recover for flood losses. While \nFederal flood insurance was created almost 40 years ago to ``provide \nthe necessary funds promptly to assure rehabilitation or restoration of \ndamaged property to pre-flood status or to permit comparable investment \nelsewhere,'' unfortunately, the program is not working as Congress \nenvisioned. Recent flooding in Maryland as a result of Hurricane Isabel \nin September 2003, showed that under the strain of a major flooding \nevent, the National Flood Insurance Program was unable to withstand the \npressure. Unfortunately, many of the 6,000 Marylanders who filed claims \nafter Hurricane Isabel found the process of recovering under their \nflood insurance policies to be difficult, time-consuming and \nfrustrating. Too many victims were given incomplete or inaccurate \ninformation or were coerced into settling claims that came nowhere near \nclose to providing adequate funding for repairs.\n  My amendment, as contained in this bill, ensures that policyholders \nare provided with accurate and timely information about their policies \nas well as what to do in the event of a flood. As a result of this \nlegislation, FEMA will be required to establish a formal appeals \nprocess for complaints; disseminate a claims handbook so that families \nknow exactly what to do if they are flooded; provide simple forms and \ndisclosures so that all policyholders know what coverages are available \nand what coverages they are purchasing; and, establish minimum agent \ntraining requirements so that insurance agents, the main points of \ncontact for flood victims, have a better understanding of this program. \nIn addition, this bill asks the General Accounting Office of conduct a \nthorough review of the flood insurance program, with particular \nemphasis on limitations in the flood insurance policy and FEMA's \ninterpretations of this policy. We need to have a detailed \nunderstanding of what these limitations are and what the consequences \nare of broadening coverage. As a result of these changes, I am hopeful \nthat flood victims around the country will not face the same obstacles \nto receiving fair payments as Marylanders faced last year.\n  In addition to the administrative changes we are making in this bill, \nI have been working with my colleague, Senator Mikulski, and FEMA to \nensure that FEMA does all it can to improve its processes and policies \nso that flood victims can better navigate the flood insurance program \nand more fairly settle their claims. I believe that FEMA is working to \nfix those problems that were brought to its attention, and I want to \nthank Mr. Anthony Lowe, former Federal insurance administrator, and Mr. \nTrey Reid, acting insurance administrator, who now oversees the \nprogram, for working with me and my colleagues to go back and make sure \nthat Hurricane Isabel flood victims are treated fairly. After Hurricane \nIsabel, I received numerous complaints that flood victims were \npressured into accepting settlements far below what they consider fair, \nin addition to our findings that FEMA distributed inaccurate price \nguidelines for the costs of repairs. When confronted with these issues, \nMr. Lowe, Mr. Reid, and FEMA staff quickly responded. Letters have now \nbeen sent to all flood victims who believe they were treated unfairly \ncan have their claims reviewed. While I appreciate these efforts, I \nunderstand that there is some concern that these reviews are not being \nconducted in an independent way, and I have urged FEMA to take all \nactions to ensure that this process is fair. The process of reviewing \nthese claims is a fair and necessary step in maintaining the integrity \nof the National Flood Insurance Program, and I will continue working \nwith FEMA to ensure that all victims are able to have their claims \nreviewed in an unbiased manner.\n\n  This is an important piece of legislation. In addition to the changes \ncontained in my amendment, this bill will help to strengthen and \nstabilize the flood insurance program by providing $40 million a year \nto states and communities to mitigate flood risks. While the National \nFlood Insurance Program has primarily been able to cover losses through \nthe premiums it collects, there have been times when it has had to \nborrow funds from the Treasury, and this is in large part due to a \nrelatively small number of properties. According to FEMA, these \nrepetitive loss properties account for only 1 percent of policies, but \nover 35 percent of all losses in the flood insurance program. This bill \nmakes funding available so that communities can assist families who are \nstuck in a cycle of repeated flooding to get out of harm's way, and so \nthat these properties are less of a drain on the National Flood \nInsurance Program.\n  Once again, I thank Senators Shelby and Bunning for working with me \nin such a collaborative manner on this bill.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I commend Senators Shelby, \nSarbanes, and Bunning for their efforts in drafting the S. 2238, the \nBunning/Bereuter/Blumenauer Flood Insurance Reform Act. They have \nworked with Senator Graham and me to make some important changes that \nwill greatly benefit Federal flood insurance policy holders. Since \n1968, the National Flood Insurance Program has provided reasonably \npriced insurance to Americans across the country. In Florida alone, \nthere are approximately 2 million flood insurance policies.\n  I support this legislation and, as the former elected insurance \ncommissioner of the State of Florida, appreciate its goals and purpose. \nHowever, I have a unique situation in Florida dealing with flood \ninsurance and would like to take a few minutes to bring it to my \ncolleagues' attention.\n  There is a community in Gulf Country in North Florida known as Cape \nSan Blas. The area has some of the most impressive, pristine beaches in \nthe State. You can see the unique physical characteristics of the Cape \nquite clearly from space--it is a swath of land that juts out into the \nGulf of Mexico.\n  Most of the residents of Cape San Blas have lived there for some time \nand have seen first hand the incredible damage and awesome forces of \nnature brought to bear by hurricanes. And ere we are today, 2 weeks \ninto hurricane season and a good number of the residents of the Cape \neither do not have flood insurance or have to purchase it at a very \nhigh price.\n  Since 1983, most of Cape San Blas has been included in the Coastal \nBarrier Resources System, which prevents the Cape from receiving many \nforms of Federal assistance, most notably flood insurance. But the \nresidents made due by other means, relying on the private market or, in \nsome cases, simply not purchasing flood insurance because it was not a \nrequirement at the time.\n  Back in 1995, after Hurricane Opal tore through parts of the Florida \npanhandle, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, determined \nits flood maps required revisions. The agency decided it would need to \nremap the area and began the process. The new maps took effect in \nNovember 202 and placed a large portion of the Cape and the surrounding \narea in a special flood hazard area--an area of land that has a 1 \npercent chance of being flooded in any given year. A home located\n\n[[Page S6815]]\n\nwithin this area has a 26 percent chance of suffering flood damage \nduring the term of a 30-year mortgage.\n  The special flood hazard area designation has had a devastating \neffect on the local economy for several reasons. First, under the Flood \nDisaster Protection Act of 1973 mandates flood insurance for property \nin a special flood hazard area that receives a federally backed loan. \nIf a local bank writes a home loan, without Federal backing, while the \nbank may not require flood insurance, it does face a safety and \nsoundness issue and possible enforcement action with federal banking \nregulators for offering high-risk loans.\n  As a result of the new classification, some residents who never had \nto carry flood insurance before suddenly found it was a requirement. \nMany long-time homeowners have been forced to scramble to buy private \nflood insurance, often at very high rates. Some are also prevented from \nborrowing against their hard-earned equity, because second mortgages \nalso require hard-to-obtain flood insurance. Local banks have had to \nturn away homeowners because of this.\n  The new maps and classification have had a devastating effect on \nhomeowners and the local economy already weakened by the closure of a \npaper mill and saddled with high rates of unemployment. With the stroke \nof a pen, FEMA radically changed the lives of thousands of residents \nand property owners in Cape San Blas. On the Cape, prior to FEMA's new \nmaps, about 70 percent of the lands were not in special flood zone \nareas and financing was easily obtainable. The new maps placed \napproximately 75 percent of the Cape in a special flood hazard area and \nfinancing is near impossible. Even worse, the new flood maps have \nslowed the new economic engine of the Cape--tourism, construction and \ndevelopment.\n  This is a clear case of a Government action adversely affecting the \nlives of citizens. It is simply unfair. There must be a way to make the \nresidents whole again, and I think we have a responsibility to explore \nevery possible avenue to do so. I had considered legislative remedies \nfor the residents of Cape San Blas on the flood insurance bill. Yet I \nam very aware the flood insurance program is set to expire in 15 days \nand do not want to block the passage of this legislation, which is so \ncritical to Florida and the Nation. But in the coming weeks, I intend \nto work with my colleagues and the Banking and Environment and Public \nWorks Committees, with Congressman Allen Boyd, who represents Cape San \nBlas, and the appropriate Federal agencies to find an equitable \nsolution to the problem facing the residents of Cape San Blas.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I am pleased to see that the Senate will \nreauthorize the National Flood Insurance program today. This is such an \nimportant program for the people of Louisiana.\n  If there is a theme that runs through the social and economic history \nof my State, it is water. The Mississippi River, with its great \nsouthern port of New Orleans, has been a center of commerce and an \neconomic gateway to the east. Smaller rivers, streams, and bayous run \nthroughout our parishes. More than 8,277 square miles of Louisiana are \ncovered by water, nearly 16 percent. The entire southern third of my \nState could be called a giant wetland, much of it below sea level, \nincluding the city of New Orleans.\n  Floods are a part of life in Louisiana, particularly in the southern \npart of the State. Louisiana has more than 377,000 insured properties \nunder the program as of 2003. That same year the program paid nearly \n6,000 flood loss claims in Louisiana. The National Flood Insurance \nProgram allows Louisianians to stay in their homes and protects them \nfrom the devastation nature can wreak.\n  The flood program gives the housing, insurance, banking, and mortgage \nlending markets in my State greater stability. It also brings peace of \nmind to those families who need the program to protect their most \nimportant assets: their homes and businesses.\n  However, when this reauthorization bill was reported out of the \nBanking Committee, I had deep concerns about a pilot program contained \nin the bill designed to address severe repetitive loss properties. \nThese are properties that experience a lot of flooding. The Federal \nEmergency Management Agency estimates that these repetitive loss \nproperties, while only making up about one percent of all the insured \nproperties, cost the program $200 million annually. Some property \nowners have collected flood claims that are four or five times higher \nthan the actual value of the property. They refuse to take any action \nto minimize the cost to the program and benefit from subsidized \ninsurance rates.\n  Under the pilot program, $40 million in funding would be available on \nan optional basis for States and communities to take steps to mitigate \nthe flood damage potential on these properties. If a property owner \nreceives a mitigation offer and turns it down, their flood insurance \npremiums would increase 50 percent, and would keep on increasing by 50 \npercent until it reached the actuarial rate for the property. This \nprovision would help prevent some of the abuse in the program.\n  Louisiana has the most repetitive loss properties in the county, \nabout one-third of the total number nationwide. I had concerns about \nhow this pilot program would impact low income property owners in my \nState and so I put a hold on the bill. I felt that even though State \nand local communities could opt into the program, they would not have \nas much control over how the program would get funding to property \nowners that want mitigation. FEMA held all the cards.\n  Let me give an example of what I mean. Under the original bill, FEMA \nwould award mitigation funds based upon what it felt was in the best \ninterest of the flood insurance program. I believed that this gave FEMA \nthe power to overrule local determinations of what kind of flood \nmitigation to offer and what properties to mitigate. For example, a \nlocal community that wanted to elevate a structure above the base flood \nelevation could be denied relief because FEMA decided that buyouts were \nin the best interest of the flood insurance program in order to \npermanently remove properties out of the flood insurance program \naltogether.\n  The impact this could have on property owners could be devastating. I \ndid not want to see low-income people facing a terrible choice: sell \nyour property or see your rates go up. Many of these families have \nlived on this land for generations. It may flood regularly, but it is \nalso home. I wanted to make sure the pilot program struck a proper \nbalance between the needs of the flood insurance program and the rights \nof property owners.\n  The chairman and ranking member of the Banking Committee, Senators \nShelby and Sarbanes, and myself worked together to make changes to the \nbill that I believe have achieved this balance. The changes keep the \npilot program in place but add safeguards requiring FEMA to pay greater \ndeference to local decisions about what properties to mitigate and what \nkinds of mitigation offers are most appropriate. We added demolition \nand rebuild as an additional eligible mitigation activity under the \nbill, an option that Louisiana's flood plain managers wanted. We also \nincluded a funding formula that insures that Louisiana gets its fair \nshare of funding under the pilot program. Under FEMA's current \nmitigation program, Louisiana only received about $1 million even \nthough the State had more than $60 million in need.\n  I thank Chairman Shelby and the ranking member of the Banking \nCommittee, Senator Sarbanes, as well as their staffs for their \nwillingness to work with me on these changes. We have made this \nimportant bill a better deal for local communities in my State and \nacross the country.\n  Mr. WARNER. My understanding is it is cleared on both sides. I ask \nunanimous consent that the amendment at the desk be agreed to, the \ncommittee amendments be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be read a \nthird time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, \nand that any statements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the national flood insurance program--\n       (A) identifies the flood risk;\n       (B) provides flood risk information to the public;\n       (C) encourages State and local governments to make \n     appropriate land use adjustments to constrict the development \n     of land which is exposed to flood damage and minimize damage \n     caused by flood losses; and\n       (D) makes flood insurance available on a nationwide basis \n     that would otherwise not be\n\n[[Page S6817]]\n\n     available, to accelerate recovery from floods, mitigate \n     future losses, save lives, and reduce the personal and \n     national costs of flood disasters;\n       (2) the national flood insurance program insures \n     approximately 4,400,000 policyholders;\n       (3) approximately 48,000 properties currently insured under \n     the program have experienced, within a 10-year period, 2 or \n     more flood losses where each such loss exceeds the amount \n     $1,000;\n       (4) approximately 10,000 of these repetitive-loss \n     properties have experienced either 2 or 3 losses that \n     cumulatively exceed building value or 4 or more losses, each \n     exceeding $1,000;\n       (5) repetitive-loss properties constitute a significant \n     drain on the resources of the national flood insurance \n     program, costing about $200,000,000 annually;\n       (6) repetitive-loss properties comprise approximately 1 \n     percent of currently insured properties but are expected to \n     account for 25 to 30 percent of claims losses;\n       (7) the vast majority of repetitive-loss properties were \n     built before local community implementation of floodplain \n     management standards under the program and thus are eligible \n     for subsidized flood insurance;\n       (8) while some property owners take advantage of the \n     program allowing subsidized flood insurance without requiring \n     mitigation action, others are trapped in a vicious cycle of \n     suffering flooding, then repairing flood damage, then \n     suffering flooding, without the means to mitigate losses or \n     move out of harm's way;\n       (9) mitigation of repetitive-loss properties through \n     buyouts, elevations, relocations, or flood-proofing will \n     produce savings for policyholders under the program and for \n     Federal taxpayers through reduced flood insurance losses and \n     reduced Federal disaster assistance;\n       (10) a strategy of making mitigation offers aimed at high-\n     priority repetitive-loss properties and shifting more of the \n     burden of recovery costs to property owners who choose to \n     remain vulnerable to repetitive flood damage can encourage \n     property owners to take appropriate actions that reduce loss \n     of life and property damage and benefit the financial \n     soundness of the program;\n       (11) the method for addressing repetitive-loss properties \n     should be flexible enough to take into consideration \n     legitimate circumstances that may prevent an owner from \n     taking a mitigation action; and\n       (12) focusing the mitigation and buy-out of repetitive loss \n     properties upon communities and property owners that choose \n     to voluntarily participate in a mitigation and buy-out \n     program will maximize the benefits of such a program, while \n     minimizing any adverse impact on communities and property \n     owners.\n\n           TITLE I--AMENDMENTS TO FLOOD INSURANCE ACT OF 1968\n\n     SEC. 101.

In addition, it is my expectation that \nrollcall votes could occur in relation to judicial nominations as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/15/senate-section/article/S6821-3", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6821]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9 A.M.
