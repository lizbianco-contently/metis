Mr. President, the Senate will spend the day in executive \nsession deliberating, once again and for the 10th day, the nomination \nof Miguel Estrada to be a circuit judge for the DC Circuit. Indeed, \ntoday will be a very full day. I envision a protracted session \nextending late into the evening. Rollcall votes are expected in an \neffort to make progress toward confirming this nominee in order to fill \nthis judicial vacancy.\n  There is an empty courtroom and a backed up docket awaiting this \njudge. I hope my colleagues will cooperate so that this ready, willing, \nand able nominee can report for work at the DC Circuit courthouse.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter to the President dated February \n25, 2003, signed by 52 Senators, stating that they ``express the \nstrong, majority support in the United States Senate for Miguel \nEstrada,'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         United States Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 25, 2003.\n     The Hon. George W. Bush,\n     The White House, 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, \n         DC\n       Dear Mr. President: We write to express the strong, \n     majority support in the United States Senate for Miguel \n     Estrada, your nominee to the United States Court of Appeals \n     to the District of Columbia Circuit.\n       Mr. Estrada's professional accomplishments and personal \n     achievement are truly impressive. He graduated magna cum \n     laude from both Columbia College, where he was elected to Phi \n     Beta Kappa, and Harvard Law School, where he served as an \n     editor of the Harvard Law Review. He clerked on the Second \n     Circuit Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court of the United \n     States. Miguel Estrada served with distinction as an \n     assistant U.S. Attorney in the prestigious Southern District \n     of New York, rising to Deputy Chief of the Appellate section, \n     and in the Solicitor General's office during both Republican \n     and Democrat Administrations where he argued fifteen cases \n     before the Supreme Court.\n       It is no wonder Mr. Estrada received a rare, unanimous \n     rating of ``well qualified'' from the American Bar \n     Association, what many of our colleagues call the coveted \n     ``Gold Standard.''\n       Mr. Estrada's professional successes are even more \n     remarkable in light of his compelling personal story. After \n     emigrating from Honduras at the age of seventeen, he reached \n     the pinnacle of his profession by overcoming a speech \n     impediment and mastering a second language. These are \n     daunting challenges for anyone; they are particularly \n     impressive when one's profession is the practice of oral \n     advocacy before the nation's highest court.\n       Despite his obvious qualifications and remarkable personal \n     story, we have been unable to obtain fair consideration on \n     the Senate floor for Mr. Estrada's nomination. Nevertheless, \n     we, the undersigned majority in the United States Senate, \n     commend you for your outstanding choice, and will continue to \n     work diligently to ensure Mr. Estrada receives a simple up or \n     down vote on the Senate floor.\n           Sincerely,\n         Mitch McConnel, Zell Miller, Bill Frist, Conrad Burns, \n           Norm Coleman, Lisa Murkowski, Pete Domenici, Joe Kyl, \n           John Cornyn, Jim Bunning, Judd Gregg, Arlen Specter, \n           Orrin Hatch, Robert Bennett, Mike Crapo, Jim Talent, \n           Michael B.

I will be very brief, but I will quote four paragraphs \nfrom this letter which does demonstrate the majority support of \nSenators for this nominee. The letter itself is dated February 25, \n2003. The letter is to the President of the United States.\n  First paragraph:\n\n       Dear Mr. President, we write to express the strong, \n     majority support in the United States Senate for Miguel \n     Estrada, your nominee to the United States Court of Appeals \n     to the District of Columbia Circuit.\n\n  The second paragraph reads:\n\n       Mr. Estrada's professional accomplishments and personal \n     achievement are truly impressive. He graduated magna cum \n     laude from both Columbia College, where he was elected to Phi \n     Beta Kappa, and Harvard Law School, where he served as an \n     editor of the Harvard Law Review. He clerked on the Second \n     Circuit Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court of the United \n     States.

After \n     emigrating from Honduras at the age of seventeen, he reached \n     the pinnacle of his profession by overcoming a speech \n     impediment and mastering a second language. These are \n     daunting challenges for anyone; they are particularly \n     impressive when one's profession is the practice of oral \n     advocacy before the nation's highest Court.\n\n  Mr. President, the last paragraph before the pages of the signators \nof a majority of people in this body, 52 Senators, reads:\n\n       Despite his obvious qualifications and remarkable personal \n     story, we have been unable to obtain fair consideration on \n     the Senate floor for Mr. Estrada's nomination. Nevertheless, \n     we, the undersigned majority in the United States Senate, \n     commend you for your outstanding choice, and will continue to \n     work diligently to ensure Mr. Estrada receives a simple up or \n     down vote on the Senate floor.\n\n  Again, there are 4 pages of signatures. The first page is signed by \nSenators Mitch McConnell and Zell Miller, followed by 50 signatures, \nwhich is now in the Record.\n  We will have a full day today. I look forward to continuing the \ndiscussions as we go forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/26/senate-section/article/S2724-1", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2724]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \ngo into executive session and resume consideration of Executive \nCalendar Order No. 21, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Miguel A. \nEstrada, of Virginia, to be United States Circuit Judge for the \nDistrict of Columbia Circuit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                            Order For Recess\n\n  Mr. REID. Before the majority leader leaves the floor on a matter \nregarding what we are going to do this afternoon, at 2:30 today it is \nmy understanding the Secretary of Defense will be here to brief \nSenators. I think it would be in everyone's interest if we had at least \nan hour recess during the time the Secretary is here.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, given the circumstances surrounding and \nleading to the discussion today at 2:30, that would be satisfactory on \nour part.\n  We will likely be in session late this afternoon, into the evening, \nbecause there are a number of issues we do want to address. It is \nappropriate to be in recess from 2:30 to 3:30 today.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that that be in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senator Hatch is in the Chamber, as well as \nSenator Dorgan, who has been trying to speak for 2 days now. It is \nobvious there are not enough votes, as indicated by the letter sent to \nthe President. The fact is that there are three ways to dispose of \nEstrada: No. 1, pull the nomination so we can go to other issues that \naffect this country, such as the economy, such as have a discussion \nrelating to the global warming document that came out today indicating \nthere certainly needs to be a lot more done regarding global warming. \nIt certainly is time we should be talking about the education of our \nchildren. Yesterday, the Democratic leader offered an economic stimulus \nplan. We wanted to bring that to the floor. So the nomination should be \npulled for those other reasons.\n  If that is not the case, then there is another way of disposing of \nthis matter perhaps--by having the majority file a cloture motion. That \nfailing, it seems to me they should meet our request to have him \nhonestly--I should not say honestly--thoroughly answer questions that \nhave been propounded to him; and, secondly, submit the memos to this \nbody, at least to the Judiciary Committee, so they can review the memos \nhe wrote while he was Solicitor General.\n  That failing, we can stay in tonight and tomorrow night, whatever the \nleader decides to do, but as I have indicated before, now that the \nmajority has changed, the majority has to preside and we will have \npeople to protect our interests on the floor, so that is certainly no \npunishment to us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have been interested in the approach by \nthe other side. Yesterday, they came on the floor and said, oh, my \ngoodness, we should get rid of this because we have so many important \nissues to take care of. There is one way to get it rid of it, and that \nis to let the people's representatives in the Senate vote. That is what \nthe Washington Post said: Just vote. Vote up or down.\n  The real reason they are not allowing a vote--because, as we can see \nfrom the letter, we have at least 52 votes and there have been at least \n3 other Senators on the minority side who have said they are going to \nvote for Mr. Estrada. So there are at least 55 votes for Mr. Estrada, \nand I believe there will be others votes as well.\n  It is one thing to support your party and to stand in an intractable \nway against the first Hispanic ever nominated to the Circuit Court of \nAppeals for the District of Columbia. It is another thing to come on \nthe floor and say we are not going about the people's business because \nwe are dealing with this incidental judicial nomination. Well, it is \nnot incidental. It is one of the most important nominations in the \ncountry.\n  This is a man who really deserves to be on the Circuit Court of \nAppeals for the District of Columbia. This is a man who has every \ncredential and has not had a glove laid on him. That is why the fishing \nexpedition request into privileged matters. They want to get his \nrecommendations, or I suppose in the future anybody's recommendations, \nespecially Republicans who might have worked in the Solicitor General's \nOffice, on appeals, on certiorari petitions, and on amicus curiae \nmatters. Those have never been given to anybody. Those are the crucial \ndocuments upon which the Solicitor General, the people's attorney, \nmakes decisions as to where to go and what to do. There is only one \nreason they would like to get these privileged documents, and that is \nthey are on a fishing expedition because they have not been able to \nfind anything to hang on Miguel Estrada yet, other than these phony \naccusations that he has not answered the questions.\n  My gosh, the hearing transcript is that thick; the briefs he has \nfiled and the answers in the testimony before the Supreme Court, two \nvolumes, that thick. They have more materials on Mr. Estrada to know \nwhat he is and what he is about than almost any judicial nominee, other \nthan the Supreme Court, who has been nominated in the whole 27 years I \nhave been in the Senate. I think my colleagues can take it\n\n[[Page S2725]]\n\nfrom me because I have been involved in every one of these nominations. \nAs chairman, now twice, I can say there has very seldom been anybody as \nscrutinized as Mr. Estrada. And since there is still nothing they can \npoint to that is a good reason for keeping him out of this position, \nwhat one has to conclude is the reason they are doing this--well, I \nwill leave that up to the American people, and I will leave it up to \nthe people in the Hispanic community. My personal conclusion is that \nthey do not like having a Republican, Hispanic, conservative who thinks \nfor himself as an independent thinker.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. Not yet. I will make a statement first before I yield for \na question. I will do that later, however. I have been very good about \nyielding, so I hope my colleague does not feel badly about my decision \nto make my statement first.\n  I cannot believe the arguments that have been used in this matter, \nand I cannot believe my colleagues on the other side, with their feet \nin concrete, cannot understand why this is such an important \nnomination.\n  The fact is this fellow is immensely qualified. I have had countless \npeople tell me that, in addition to my own studies, and I have had a \nlot of Democrats say he is really qualified--but.\n  ``But'' what? These phony accusations that he has not answered \nquestions? Come on. The Democrats conducted the hearings. They \ncontrolled the process. They could have kept the hearings going for \ndays. It would have been very unusual for them to do that, but they \ncould have. The hearings were conducted by Senator Schumer. Every \nDemocrat had a chance to come and ask questions. After the hearings \nwere over, they had an opportunity to present written questions to him. \nGuess how many of those nine Democrats offered written questions. Only \ntwo of them.\n  I will say, the distinguished Senator from Illinois has tried to get \nto the bottom of what he is concerned about in Federal judgeships. I \ncommend him for it. He wrote questions, and he got answers. Senator \nKennedy, who takes a very active role on the committee, wrote \nquestions, and he got answers. Where were the rest of them? Why all the \ncomplaining now, 2 years later? Are we going to make every circuit \ncourt of appeals judge wait 2 years?\n  Actually, we are finding a slowdown in the Federal judiciary like I \nhave never seen before, except for district court nominees about whom \nthey do not seem to worry too much. If they are qualified, district \ncourt nominees are the trial court nominees. Circuit court nominees \nshould be qualified, too, and this one--I would not say overly \nqualified, but not many people can match his qualifications in this \nwhole society today--here, in the 10th or 11th day of debate, he is \nbeing treated very shabbily.\n  We are in the middle of a filibuster, no matter what anyone says. \nThat is exactly what it is. I noted my friend from New York, Senator \nSchumer, said on Sunday this is not a filibuster. If it is not, I don't \nknow what it is. And, frankly, I know a lot about filibusters, having \nled one of the most important filibusters in history on labor law \nreform in 1978 that lasted at least a month. It was very tough, mean, \nmiserable, and in some ways tremendously difficult.\n  My colleague, the distinguished ranking member on the committee, on \nJune 18, 1998, said: ``I have stated over and over again on this floor \nthat I would . . . object and fight against any filibuster on a judge, \nwhether it is somebody I opposed or supported.''\n  So I suppose the distinguished Senator from Vermont will be another \nvote for Mr. Estrada, if he really meant what he said. Knowing him, I \nam sure he did mean what he said. So that would get us up to 56 votes \nright there. He also said: ``I do not want to get to having to invoke \ncloture on judicial nominations. I think it is a bad precedent.''\n  Boy, I sure agree with that. I spent 6 years during the Clinton years \nwhen a lot of liberal judges were put up, who were qualified, arguing \nwith some on our side, a relative few, but some who believed we should \nfilibuster those judges. I said: No way. We can't get into \nfilibustering of judges. It diminishes the power of the administration, \nthe executive office, the executive branch of Government, which is \nsupposed to be coequal with the legislative branch. But in addition to \ndiminishing the power of the executive branch, it diminishes the power \nof the judiciary with regard to its coequality with the executive \nbranch, so both would be diminished while the executive branch was \naugmented and made superior over both of those branches.\n\n  Why? Because a filibuster means that from here on in, with every \nnominee who may be ``controversial,'' you are going to have to have a \nsupermajority of 60 votes. Or will you? If the Democrats have their \nway, that is how it will be. And it will be both ways. There will not \nbe any more well-known liberals or well-known conservatives, as great \nas many in the past have been, on the courts of this country; there \nwill be people who do not have a paper trail, do not have any opinions, \non whom you do not know what is going on in their minds. They will be \nthe only ones who can get through for the circuit court of appeals \npositions or the Supreme Court. That would be indeed a tragedy for this \ncountry.\n  What we get when we elect a President is a person who picks the \njudges in this country. The Senate's obligation is to vote on those \njudges. If you do not like what you see, you vote no. If you like what \nyou see, you vote aye. But they get a vote on the Senate floor. That is \nnot what is happening here.\n  If press reports are to be believed, some Senators are contemplating \na dramatic change to the Senate's treatment of the President's judicial \nnominees. A new requirement: The nominees to the Nation's courts must \nreceive at least 60 votes in order to be confirmed. Since our friends \non the other side are filibustering Mr. Estrada's nomination to the \nCircuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, and if the \nfilibuster results in the nomination being rejected, Democrats will \nhave forced a permanent change in the political and constitutional \nlandscape, a very dangerous and bad change.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. I am happy to.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will only ask one question and would like the Senator's \nresponse.\n  I think there has been a very constructive and valuable suggestion by \none of your colleagues, Senator Bennett of Utah, who came to the floor \nlast week and suggested, to end this impasse, that we can finally bring \nthis matter to a vote on Mr. Estrada simply by producing the \ncontroversial documents to be reviewed by you and Senator Leahy, and if \na decision is made by either of you that there is something worth \npursuing by way of written questions or further hearing, then we can \nbring this to closure.\n  I asked Senator Daschle on the floor yesterday, would this be a good \nend game for the Estrada issue? He said it was acceptable to him. So I \nask the Senator from Utah if he would entertain the suggestion of his \ncolleague, Senator Bennett, to produce these work documents that \nreflect on Mr. Estrada's philosophy, for you, personally, for Senator \nLeahy personally, and followup, if necessary, so that we can finally \nmove on to important issues that we should be considering on the Senate \nfloor?\n  Mr. HATCH. That is a good question. I have to say, no administration \nworth their salt, no executive branch of government worth any \nconstitutional knowledge, would give up those papers, even to people \nthey trust, such as Senator Leahy and myself. The reason is they have \nto maintain the dignity of that Solicitor General's Office. They have \nto maintain the discipline of that office. They have to maintain the \nprivileged nature of those documents. If those documents are disclosed, \nthat means they will have to be disclosed henceforth forever in every \ncase where a person has worked in the Solicitor General's office. It \nwould demean the office and diminish the ability to get forthright and \naccurate information, and it would impinge upon the work of the \nSolicitor General.\n\n  The only reason those letters were written requesting those documents \nis that they knew this would constitute a red herring. The only thing \nthey have to argue against Miguel Estrada is a red herring, so they can \nsay: We cannot vote for him because we cannot get these documents. \nWhich is right, they cannot get them. No self-respecting administration \nwould give them.\n\n[[Page S2726]]\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. One last question. The chairman suggested it would be \nunprecedented to produce these documents. But is the chairman not aware \nof the fact that similar documents were produced when William Rehnquist \nwas being nominated to the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, when \nRobert Bork's nomination came before the Senate, Benjamin Civiletti, \nand several other cases?\n  This is not unprecedented and has happened before. To suggest this \nadministration would be breaking new ground--would the Senator from \nUtah concede that other administrations, Republican administrations, \nand Democrat, have disclosed this kind of information? We are \nsuggesting, through Senator Bennett, a limited disclosure to you and \nSenator Leahy--\n  Mr. HATCH. The Senator is again mistaken. He is absolutely wrong, \ntotally inaccurate.\n  The fact is the request was for his recommendation on his appeal \nrecommendations, his certiorari recommendations, his amicus curiae \nrecommendations. Those have never ever been given to anybody up here on \nCapitol Hill. And they shouldn't be given to anybody. Those are the \nmost crucial recommendations the Solicitor General gets and relies \nupon.\n  There are some cases where documents for appeal, certiorari, amicus \ncuriae documents, were leaked to Democrat Senators in the past, and \nthere were one or two cases where there were allegations of criminal \nbehavior, or potential criminal behavior, where very selected documents \nwere produced. But there has never, ever been a production of internal, \nprivileged recommendations for appeals, certiorari, and amicus curiae. \nAgain, the Senator is mistaken. I hesitate to point that out, but it is \nsomething that has to be pointed out.\n  I believe with all my heart that my friends on the other side know \nthat. So this is a phony issue they have raised. Here is a man who has \nthe highest rating of the American Bar Association, given by a majority \nof Democrats who have supported financially other Democrats, and yet \nthey found him worthy of the highest rating of the American Bar \nAssociation. I know my colleagues do not like that, even though many of \nthem said he deserves it, he is that good, but we are going to vote \nagainst cloture anyway--because we are Democrats, I guess.\n  Is that really the reason? What is the reason there is a double \nstandard with regard to Miguel Estrada? Is it because we are Democrats? \nI hope not. Is it because we are liberals? You got that one right. Is \nit because he is an independent thinker? You have that one right. Is \nit because he just does not toe the line of the Democratic Party? You \ngot that right. Is it because he is a Republican Hispanic? You got that \nright. Is it because he is a Republican Hispanic who may be \nconservative? You bet. Is it because he is a Republican Hispanic who \nmay be conservative who might even be pro-life? I don't know what he is \nthat way, but that is surely part of it.\n\n  In other words, it is a double standard, even though we did not take \nthat standard on our side. There were some who wanted to, I admit that. \nBut I didn't take that standard in approving 377 Clinton judges, the \nsecond all-time record of judicial confirmations in the history of the \nPresidency, second only to Ronald Reagan, who had 6 years of a \nRepublican Senate to help him, where President Clinton had only 2 years \nof a Democrat Senate to help him.\n  Think about it. What do you conclude is the reason they are fighting \nthis? Because they found something wrong with Miguel Estrada? Show me \nwhat it is. Because of this red herring issue--and they know it is a \nred herring issue--that they know is improper to even ask for?\n  But counting on their friends in the media to ignore the seven former \nSolicitors General, four of whom are Democrat, leading liberal Democrat \nSolicitors General who say those papers should never be given to the \nlegislative branch--it would upset and ruin the work of the Solicitor \nGeneral of the United States; he is the people's attorney. That is the \nonly thing they have. Yet they are filibustering this man, this \nHispanic, this first Hispanic ever nominated to the Circuit Court of \nAppeals for the District of Columbia, and one of the few ever nominated \nto the circuit courts of appeals in this country. It is amazing to me.\n  What really louses this up for them, as far as I am concerned, is \ntheir claim that he does not have any judicial experience; therefore, \nhe should not have this position. That is condemning every Hispanic \nlawyer to never be a Federal court judge, by and large, because hardly \nany of them have judicial experience. The only way they get it is by \nrising in the profession, like Miguel Estrada, reaching the top of the \nprofession, and getting nominated by a President of the United States.\n  It is a tough road for Hispanics. Here is one who has made it, and my \ncolleagues on the other side are standing in his way, blocking his \npath, taking away his future. He is the embodiment of the American \ndream, and they are taking away his future as a judge. I suppose part \nof it also is to discourage conservative Hispanics, conservatives of \nother minorities, from wanting to be judges if they are Republicans \nbecause it is not worth going through this kind of a battle.\n  I chatted with Miguel Estrada yesterday. Miguel Estrada said it is \nworth going through this battle. He will do a great job on that court. \nHe will do it in the best interests of the American people, regardless \nof ideology. That is basically what he said in answers to these \nquestions that were raised by Democrats. He basically said he would \nfollow the law as he always has as a top-flight attorney.\n  Now, are we going to have to have 60 votes to confirm \n``controversial'' nominees? If his nomination is rejected by a \nfilibuster, then Democrats will have forced a permanent change in the \npolitical and constitutional landscape.\n  Never again could any future President--or even this President--\nfairly expect a judicial nominee, whose nomination reaches the Senate \nfloor, to receive an up-or-down vote. And never again would the Senate \nminority party fear that blocking of a judicial nominee by partisan \nfilibuster, or 41 votes, was unprecedented.\n  If the Estrada nomination is permanently blocked by filibuster, the \npolitical baseline shifts forever. What is sauce for the goose is going \nto be sauce for the gander. And I think it is terrible. I am doing \neverything in my power to fight against that. It is even bigger than \nthis nomination, as important as this nomination is, because it could \ntaint the Federal judiciary henceforth and forever because of partisan \npolitics on the Democrat side.\n  To understand just how stunningly extraordinary this state of affairs \nis, one needs to examine the Senate's record of confirming judicial \nnominations.\n  The first filibuster of a judicial nominee that resulted in a cloture \nvote was in 1968. In other words, in all the history of this country, \nthat was the first filibuster, in 1968. Since then, the Senate has \nconfirmed approximately 1,600 judicial nominations--since 1968. That \nfilibuster was on the Fortas nomination. Since then, they have \nconfirmed approximately 1,600 judicial nominations, and the vast \nmajority--nearly 1,500--of them without even a rollcall vote, as most \nare confirmed by unanimous consent.\n  Indeed, of those some 1,600 judicial nominations confirmed by the \nSenate since 1968, only 14 even underwent a cloture vote. And with the \nexception of the bipartisan 1968 filibuster of Abe Fortas's nomination \nto be Chief Justice of the United States, the Senate has never--let me \nrepeat that--has never blocked by filibuster a judicial nominee to any \ncourt in this land--never; never--until this, I think, ill-fated, \nhopefully, attempt on the part of some of our colleagues on the other \nside.\n  I am just wondering why some of my strong colleagues are being led \nlike lambs to the slaughter in this matter without standing up and \nsaying: Hey, enough is enough. We have made our point. We have roughed \nthis guy up. We made it clear to him that, ``you had better behave \nyourself on the court or you will never be on the Supreme Court.'' That \nis part of this, I know. That may be a legitimate part as far as I am \nconcerned. They have a right to rough anybody up, I suppose, although I \nquestion the propriety of it from time to time.\n  What follows is an account of all past debates over judicial nominees \nwhich\n\n[[Page S2727]]\n\nrequired cloture votes. The history establishes a consistent, \nbipartisan resistance to taking the step that some Democrats are really \ndoing right now.\n  Let me talk about the bipartisan Fortas filibuster because, indeed, \nthat was a bipartisan filibuster. It was not just one side, as it is \nhere. But I decry that. That filibuster should not have occurred \neither.\n  Judicial nominations have been especially contentious since the days \nof the Warren Court. That was from 1954 to 1969. Nowhere has that \ncontroversy been more pronounced than for nominees to the Nation's \nhighest court. In particular, Supreme Court nominees such as Abe \nFortas, William Rehnquist, and Clarence Thomas all faced considerable \nopposition in the Senate during their confirmations. Yet despite this \ncontroversy, only one nomination, Justice Fortas's nomination to be \nChief Justice in the tumultuous summer of 1668, caused the Senate to \nfilibuster and block confirmation.\n  President Lyndon Johnson nominated Associate Justice Abe Fortas to be \nChief Justice in June of 1968. A bipartisan coalition of Senators soon \nformed to oppose Justice Fortas's elevation. The reasons were varied. \nSome opposed the nomination because Justice Fortas often joined the \n``progressive'' Earl Warren wing of the activist Supreme Court. Other \nSenators opposed Fortas because of his admissions before the Judiciary \nCommittee that he remained involved in White House political affairs \neven while serving on the Supreme Court, including advising the \nPresident during the Vietnam war and the then-recent race riots in \nDetroit. When it was discovered that Justice Fortas accepted $15,000--\nmore than $75,000 in 2001 dollars--from controversial sources to teach \na 9-week academic course, his support further deteriorated. Yet as the \nheated 1968 election season continued, some Democrats were wary of \ndefeating Fortas if that meant leaving the nomination to soon-to-be-\nPresident-elect Richard Nixon.\n  Nevertheless, bipartisan opposition to Fortas's elevation was \nsubstantial and the filibuster did ensue. The filibuster itself was \ncontroversial, as some Republicans, such as Nixon himself, believed \nthat Fortas should receive an up-or-down vote as a matter of principle. \nThat would have been my position at the time. And it is my position \nnow. Senators persisted, and on October 1, a cloture vote failed by a \nmargin of 45 to 43. Twenty-four Republicans and nineteen Democrats \nvoted against the cloture motion, with 10 Republicans and 35 Democrats \nin favor of cutting off debate. President Johnson then withdrew the \nnomination.\n  Now let me chat a little bit about the effect of the Fortas \nfilibuster on future Supreme Court battles.\n  After the Fortas filibuster, the Senate rejected outright two of \nPresident Nixon's nominees to the Supreme Court, Clement Haynsworth--\nthat was on a vote of 45 to 55--and G. Harold Carswell--on a vote of 48 \nto 51. But neither nominee faced a filibuster attempt despite the close \nvotes. The Fortas affair is, therefore, especially important for what \nit did not lead to: a pattern of blocking by filibuster controversial \njudicial nominees.\n  That refusal to block nominees by filibuster is most dramatic and \nimportant in the context of the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court \nnominations that most divided the Senate since the Haynsworth and \nCarswell defeats were those of William Rehnquist--in 1972 to the Court, \nand in 1986 to be Chief Justice--and Clarence Thomas in 1991.\n  Rehnquist's nomination to be Associate Justice provoked considerable \ncontroversy and division within the Senate, but he nonetheless received \na full Senate vote after but a few days' debate. The same was true in \n1986, when he was nominated to become Chief Justice.\n  During Clarence Thomas's hard-fought nomination battle of 1991, \noutside activist groups urged Justice Thomas's Senate opponents to \nfilibuster his nomination, but Senate Democrats, such as then-Judiciary \nChairman Joseph Biden, and leading Thomas opponent Senator Howard \nMetzenbaum, balked. Former Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy \npublicly declared himself ``totally opposed to a filibuster,'' adding, \n``We should vote for or against [Thomas].'' I commend my colleague for \nthat. He was right then, and he would be right today to do the same. No \nfilibuster was attempted, and Justice Thomas was confirmed 52 to 48.\n  As is well known, President Clinton's nominations of both Ruth Bader \nGinsburg and Stephen Breyer sailed through the Senate with minimal \ndebate and no filibusters. Justice Ginsburg was confirmed 96 to 3, and \nJustice Breyer was confirmed 87 to 9.\n\n  Now I want to make the point that lower court nominees have never \nbeen blocked by filibusters.\n  Given the Senate's general unwillingness to filibuster nominees--even \nSupreme Court nominees--it is surprising that the Senate has never \nblocked by filibuster a nominee to any lower court. Furthermore, the \nSenate has never blocked--by a partisan filibuster--any judicial \nnominee, including Justice Fortas. The only successful rejection by \nfilibuster was the aforementioned case of Justice Fortas, which was \nclearly bipartisan. Thus, there is no historical example of a \nfilibuster conducted solely by one party that denied the President his \njudicial nominee--until now. This is the first time in the history of \nthis country. It is amazing to me that my colleagues on the other side \nare so blatant about it.\n  Now, there have been recent, what some people have called, quasi-\nfilibusters of President Bush's judicial nominees.\n  During the Democratic control of the Senate during 2001 to 2002, only \n17 Bush circuit court nominees reached the floor for votes. In three of \nthe cases where they did--the nominations of Julia Smith Gibbons, \nRichard B. Clifton, and Lavenski R. Smith--cloture motions were filed, \nand the motions easily carried. However, none of those cloture votes \nwas responding to a genuine effort to filibuster a nominee. Rather, \ncloture motions were filed as a Senate time-management device--\ncertainly in the Clifton and Gibbons matters--or in response to a small \nnumber of Senators who wished to force the cloture vote to draw \nattention to another issue unrelated to the nominee--such as in the \ncase of nominee Smith.\n  Now, despite a Republican majority during 6 years of President \nClinton's term, no judicial nominee was ever deprived of a vote on the \nSenate floor because of a floor filibuster of the nomination.\n  Many Senators may recall the controversy over President Clinton's \nnominations of Marsha Berzon and Richard Paez to the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Ninth Circuit. Although most Republican Senators \nopposed their confirmations, the majority of Republican Senators also \nopposed any effort to prevent the full Senate from voting on their \nnominations. Debate on each nomination lasted only 1 day. These were \nvery liberal, some thought activist, nominees, and yet the debate \nlasted 1 day. We are now on our 11th, I think--10th or 11th--day on \nthis debate.\n  So debate on each nomination lasted only 1 day, and a majority of \nRepublicans joined all Democrats in supporting cloture motions for \ndebate on each nomination, including over 20 Republicans who would \neventually vote against confirmation and a majority of the Republican \nmembers of the Judiciary Committee.\n  In neither case did Republicans mount a party-line filibuster effort \nto prevent voting on any nominee. Indeed, Majority Leader Lott filed \nthe cloture motions for the above debates.\n  The situation was similar in 1994, when some Republicans voiced \nobjections to President Clinton's nomination of H. Lee Sarokin to the \nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. A majority of Republicans \nsupported a cloture motion after a relatively brief period of debate, \nand cloture was invoked by a vote of 85 to 12. It was clear it was a \ntime-management device. It was not a filibuster. Judge Sarokin was then \nconfirmed by a vote of only 63 to 35.\n  The only judge nominated by President Clinton who faced a partisan \nfilibuster was Brian Theadore Stewart, a nominee to the Federal \nDistrict Court in Utah. However, it was the Senate Democrats--not \nRepublicans--who filibustered this Clinton nominee in protest over \npurported delays in bringing other judicial nominees to the floor. A \ncloture motion was voted upon on September 21, 1999, and it failed--by \nfalling short of 60 votes--by a vote of 55 to 44,\n\n[[Page S2728]]\n\nwith all Democrats except Senator Moynihan opposing cloture. But once \nagain, the Democrats' objection was not to Judge Stewart himself, who \nhas since proven to be an excellent judge on the bench, and on October \n5, 1999, the Senate confirmed him by a vote of 93 to 5. So it clearly \nwas not a serious filibuster, even though the Democrats used that for \nvarious reasons, none of which related to Judge Stewart.\n  For all the hand wringing about the ``treatment'' of President \nClinton's nominees, one thing is clear: Every nomination taken up for \ndebate on the floor received an up-or-down vote.\n  Even when Democrats attempted to filibuster Republican Presidents' \njudicial nominees, those efforts were still unsuccessful, as a \nsubstantial majority of Senators resisted using the partisan filibuster \nas a means to block judicial nominations.\n  When President Bush nominated Edward Carnes to be a judge on the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, in 1992, many Democrats \nopposed the nomination on the merits, in particular because of his past \nprosecution of death penalty cases.\n  Aware of this opposition, the Senate agreed by unanimous consent to 2 \ndays of debate, with a cloture vote to follow. The debate proceeded, \nand the cloture motion carried by a vote of 66 to 30, with 24 Democrats \njoining 42 Republicans to close the debate. The Senate proceeded \nimmediately to confirm Judge Carnes by a vote of 62 to 36.\n  I hope my friends on the other side will realize that they have \nraised a big fuss here. They certainly got their points across--\nwhatever those points are--whether valid or invalid. It is time to vote \non the nomination.\n  A similarly close cloture vote occurred in March 1986 when the Senate \nconsidered President Reagan's nomination of Sidney Fitzwater to be a \nFederal district court judge in Texas. Many Democrats opposed Judge \nFitzwater on the merits and after a few days' debate, Majority Leader \nDole filed a cloture motion which, by unanimous consent, was to be \nvoted on the next day the Senate was in session. That cloture motion \nprevailed, 64-33, with the support of 12 Democrats. The Senate \nproceeded immediately to confirm Judge Fitzwater by a vote of 52-42.\n  The only other judicial nominee of President Reagan's to face a \ncloture vote was J. Harvie Wilkinson to the U.S. Court of Appeals for \nthe Fourth Circuit. Many Democrats opposed the nominee and filibustered \nthe nomination. An initial cloture motion failed on July 31, 1984, 57-\n39, because some Senators argued that additional information had arisen \nsince Judge Wilkinson's original Judiciary Committee hearings and that \nfurther investigation was necessary. Judge Wilkinson returned to the \nJudiciary Committee on August 7, his nomination was returned to the \nfloor of the Senate, and a second cloture motion prevailed on August 9 \nby a vote of 65-32. The Senate then proceeded immediately to confirm \nJudge Wilkinson by a vote of 58-39.\n  It is apparent that Democrats historically have been more willing \nthan Republicans to vote against cloture motions and to attempt to \nprevent votes on Republican judicial nominees. In other words, they \nhave been more than willing on occasion to filibuster Republican \nnominees. Apparently not in true filibusters, however. However, it is \nimportant to note that even in the cases above, many Democrats found \nthe filibuster process inappropriate in the judicial nominee context \nand insisted upon full Senate votes.\n  Senators, Led by Republican Gordon Humphrey and Democrat Robert \nMorgan of North Carolina, Filibustered the nomination of Justice \nStephen Breyer to be a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First \nCircuit in late 1980. Their objection was not to Mr. Breyer's \nqualifications--indeed, this is the same Stephen Breyer currently \nserving as a Supreme Court Justice--but to the process by which he was \nnominated and reported to the full Senate. The Senators argued that the \nJudiciary Committee had improperly reported out Mr. Breyer's nomination \nwithout proper committee approval and without regard to many other \nearlier-nominated persons waiting for hearings. After forcing the \nJudiciary Committee to reconvene and approve the nominee through proper \nprocedures, the Senate invoked cloture, 68-28, and confirmed Mr. \nBreyer, 80-10.\n  So it clearly was not a filibuster, a real filibuster.\n  This history demonstrates that while some nominees have been \nfilibustered and cloture petitions filed in those and other situations, \nthe only nominee ever to have been defeated or withdrawn after a \nfilibuster was Abe Fortas in 1968. Even key Democrats who opposed \nRepublican nominees voted for cloture. So, if a partisan filibuster of \nMiguel Estrada resulted in his nomination being defeated, it would be \nunprecedented.\n  A partisan attempt to block Mr. Estrada's nomination by filibuster \nwould contradict the repeated and emphatic statements of Democrats who \nhave served for a long time in positions of special responsibility in \nthese matters. I am calling on those Democrats to continue to be \nresponsible, not irresponsible. To vote against cloture in this case I \nthink would be irresponsible because they know how serious this is. \nConsider the past comments by Senators regarding judicial and executive \nnominees:\n  Senator Leahy, past Judiciary Chairman and current Ranking Member \nsaid:\n\n       If we want to vote against somebody, vote against them. I \n     respect that. State your reasons. I respect that. But don't \n     hold up a qualified judicial nominee. . . . I have stated \n     over and over again on this floor that I would . . . object \n     and fight against any filibuster on a judge, whether it is \n     somebody I opposed or supported; that I felt the Senate \n     should do its duty.\n\n  That was on June 18, 1998, right in the Congressional Record.\n  The distinguished Senator from Vermont again:\n\n       I have said on the floor, although we are different \n     parties, I have agreed with Gov. George Bush, who has said \n     that in the Senate a nominee ought to get a [floor] vote, up \n     or down, within 60 days.\n\n  That was on October 11, 2000.\n  The distinguished minority leader, Senator Daschle, had this to say:\n\n       As Chief Justice Rehnquist has recognized: ``The Senate is \n     surely under no obligation to confirm any particular nominee, \n     but after the necessary time for inquiry it should vote him \n     up or vote him down.'' An up-or-down vote, that is all we ask \n     for [Clinton judicial nominees] Berzon and Paez.\n\n  That was on October 5, 1999.\n  The distinguished Senator from Delaware, a past Judiciary Committee \nChairman said:\n\n       But I also respectfully suggest that everyone who is \n     nominated ought to have a shot, to have a hearing and to have \n     a shot, to have a hearing and to have a shot to be heard on \n     the floor and have a vote on the floor. . . . It is totally \n     appropriate for Republicans to reject every single nominee if \n     they want to. That is within their right. But it is not, I \n     will respectfully request, Madam president, appropriate not \n     to have hearings on them, not to bring them to the floor and \n     not to allow a vote. . . .\n\n  That was on March 19, 1997.\n  The distinguished Senator from Massachusetts, also a past Judiciary \nCommittee Chairman:\n\n       The Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court said: \n     ``The Senate is surely under no obligation to confirm any \n     particular nominee, but after the necessary time for inquiry \n     it should vote him up or vote him down.'' Which is exactly \n     what I would like.\n\n  That was on March 7, 2000.\n  Again, Senator Kennedy, the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts \nsaid on February 3, 1998:\n\n       We owe it to Americans across the country to give these \n     nominees a vote. If our Republican colleagues don't like \n     them, vote against them. But give them a vote.\n\n  That is exactly what I would like.\n  The Senator from California, Ms. Feinstein, a distinguished member of \nour Judiciary Committee on September 16, 1999, said:\n\n       A nominee is entitled to a vote. Vote them up; vote them \n     down.\n\n  There are others but I will leave it at that. Absent from any of the \ncurrent debate over Miguel Estrada is any explanation as to why he \nshould be denied the floor vote that every one of President Clinton's \njudicial nominees who reached the floor received.\n  The rejection of Abe Fortas to serve as chief Justice of the United \nStates marked the first and only time the Senate has rejected a \nPresident's judicial nominee by way of a filibuster. Yet, Miguel \nEstrada presents none of the concerns that caused a bipartisan \ncoalition of Senators to block Justice Fortas's elevation to Chief \nJustice. Mr. Estrada is an outstanding nominee, fully qualified for \nthis judgeship, who\n\n[[Page S2729]]\n\nhas committed to enforce the Constitution as interpreted by the Supreme \nCourt, not to interpose his personal political views into his \njurisprudence. The American Bar Association unanimously gave him its \nhighest rating of ``well-qualified''; and Democrats such as President \nClinton's Solicitor General, Seth Waxman, and Vice President Gore's \nattorney, Ron Klain, have praised his intellect, judgment, and \nintegrity.\n  But the stakes here are much greater than the fate of a single \njudicial nominee. At issue is whether the Senate should reinterpret its \nconstitutional advise and consent obligation to require 60 rather than \n51 votes to confirm a judicial nominee. This is a position that the \nSenate has never taken in the context of lower court nominees, and \nRepublicans especially have eschewed. To adopt this new standard would \nfundamentally alter the balance of power between the Executive and the \nSenate in the judicial confirmation process and would seriously erode \nthe comity that generally has existed between the two branches in the \npast.\n  For the life of me, I don't understand why my colleagues on the other \nside are delaying this explosive issue like they are. They are just \nasking for it. I think our side is far more capable of conducting \nfilibusters than they are. I think the past proves it. And we have won \non them. I think they are totally capable of conducting this filibuster \nif they ignore all the precedents, if they ignore all the history, if \nthey ignore the Constitution, and the unconstitutionality of what they \nare doing, they ignore the future and what is going to happen when \nDemocrat nominees become President. I think they are making a \ntremendous mistake to even go this far. I call upon my colleagues, at \nleast I call upon the reasonable people on the other side, I call upon \nthe people who have good faith in the Senate, who believe in the \nprocess, who really want to have a fair deal in judicial nominations, \nwho really don't want to have this whole system break down, although it \nhas been called broken by no less than a former Solicitor General, \nWalter Dellinger, one of the four who basically have said Miguel \nEstrada is a good man, and who basically has said these documents \nshould never be given to the legislative branch because they are \nprivileged executive documents--Democrats said that. I think it is very \nimportant my colleagues, the ones who are clear thinkers on the other \nside, the ones who really believe in this institution, the ones who \nreally believe in the judicial nominations process, the ones who really \ncan see the future and not just the instant, that they stop this \nfilibuster and give an up-or-down vote, voting whichever way they want, \non Miguel Estrada.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the distinguished Senator \nfrom North Dakota, Mr. Dorgan, be permitted to speak, and then \nimmediately following Senator Dorgan, Senator Specter from Pennsylvania \nbe recognized to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina). Is there \nobjection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I hope I perhaps am one of those clear \nthinkers and ``reasonable'' people the Senator from Utah was referring \nto. I suspect there are a good many in this Chamber who are self-\nproclaimed clear thinkers and reasonable people.\n  I am not out here as a member of the Judiciary Committee. I do not \nspend a lot of time on judicial issues, on a point of nomination. And \non judicial nominations, I want to work with President Bush.\n  We have had two Republican nominees for judges in the east and west \ndistricts of North Dakota in the last year and a half. I have been \npleased to work with President Bush on their nominations. We now have \ninvestiture of a Republican judge in the western district of North \nDakota, someone I supported--a Republican but someone I strongly \nsupported. He will be a fine Federal judge. I know I am going to be \nproud of him.\n  There is a nominee before the Judiciary Committee for the east \ndistrict in Fargo. I likewise have strong support for that nominee of \nPresident Bush. I think he will be a fine Federal judge. He is a \nRepublican. But the fact is he will, I think, make us proud of the \nFederal bench. I am very pleased to say that the President chose well. \nHe consulted with us. And I was very supportive of the two judges who \nwill now assume the bench in the Federal districts of North Dakota.\n  So I am not someone who comes to this saying I am a Democrat with \nrespect to this process and the process should be political. That is \nnot the way I come to this.\n  But I do believe this Congress has a responsibility to advise and \nconsent, and it is not a responsibility to have a huge rubberstamp, \nwhere the President sends us a nomination and we say, yes, sir; yes, \nsir, count us in. That is not the responsibility of advise and consent.\n  The constitutional responsibility for Congress is equal to the \nPresident's. He proposes and we make a judgment on his proposal. He \nsends us a nomination. We make a judgment.\n  Now this is not some ordinary decision on the floor of the Senate. \nThis is a lifetime appointment. When we decide to confirm a nominee \nsent to us by the White House, this is not for 2 years or 5 years or 15 \nyears or 25 years; it is for a lifetime. And we ought to take that \nseriously. I know most Members of the Senate do. So if we are going to \nbe passing judgment on a nominee who is going to be there for a \nlifetime, let's know a little about the nominee.\n  I was proud to support Dan Hovland, who is now the confirmed Federal \njudge in the west district of North Dakota. President Bush nominated \nhim, and I was proud to support him. But unlike Miguel Estrada, Mr. \nHovland cooperated with the Judiciary Committee. He was asked during \nhis confirmation process, ``Can you list three Supreme Court cases that \nyou disagree with?'' And unlike Mr. Estrada, Mr. Hovland had no \ndifficulty answering that simple question.\n  Why would one ask a nominee that question? To get a sense of how they \nthink and reason. Mr. Hovland didn't object to that. Judge Hovland \nreadily identified a couple of recent cases--Thompson v. Western States \nMedical Center, Behrens v. Peltier. He cited a case that most would \ncite, Korematsu v. the United States, the case in which the Supreme \nCourt affirmed the conviction of a person of Japanese ancestry for the \nviolation of a curfew order solely because of the individual's \nancestry. So Mr. Hovelnd was asked a simple question and was happy to \ngive us a glimpse of how he was thinking about things, and how he \nviewed some of these decisions. He didn't object to answering that \nquestion. He was asked a simple question, and he gave a straightforward \nanswer that was helpful to my colleagues and me.\n  Other nominees have been asked the same kinds of questions. Mr. \nEstrada, however, has not been willing to answer those questions. He \napparently thinks there is some inherent right to be confirmed by the \nSenate.\n  There is no inherent right for a confirmation. We have a \nresponsibility to understand who these nominees are and then to pass \njudgment on them as to whether or not we think they deserve a lifetime \nappointment to the bench. As I have indicated, on at least two Federal \njudgeships in North Dakota, I was proud to support Republicans. I think \nPresident Bush chose well.\n  I don't have the information about Mr. Estrada with which to make \nthat judgment. Some say, well, look, you don't need the information, \nyou don't deserve the information, and we don't want you to get the \ninformation. So belly up here and vote. If you don't like it, it \ndoesn't matter, just vote.\n  Really, how would you vote if you don't have basic information? We \nhave sent Mr. Estrada a letter saying you have not answered basic \nquestions; you have not allowed to have released the basic information. \nProvide all of that and let's have a vote.\n  I am for that. For me, this isn't about a filibuster. It is about \nsaying we ought to have nominees provide the basic information to \nMembers of the Senate before there is a vote. Mr. Estrada has not done \nthat. It is simple. He hasn't done that. Perhaps when he does it, he \nwill get a big vote in the Senate. I don't know. But I think it is a \nterrible precedent for the Senate to allow a nominee to say, I am not \ngoing to answer your questions; I will show up and give you my name and \ntell you\n\n[[Page S2730]]\n\nwhere I went to school, but I don't intend to talk about much else at \nall.\n  Mr. Estrada has never been a judge. We don't have judicial record to \nexamine. We don't have any information about that. That is the reason \nwe have asked him the same kinds of questions we have asked others. The \ndifference is he has not responded. I don't understand that.\n  Let me also say something else. I have listened to my colleague from \nUtah, and he is one of the more capable Members of the Senate. He \ntalked about delay and how terrible it was to delay this, that, and the \nother thing. Let me tell you something. We understand what it feels \nlike to be faced with delay on judicial nominations. We have been on \nthe receiving end of it for a long time. Notwithstanding that fact, I \ndon't believe we ought to delay anybody just for the sake of delay. I \nthink we get the information and we move forward. If we don't get the \ninformation requested of a nominee, there is no inherent right for a \nnominee to go to a vote, to receive a lifetime appointment.\n  We know a little about facing delay. I find it interesting that those \nwho were the architects of delay for so long now come to the floor--\nmany of them--and say it is terrible what has happened here.\n\n  I will give you examples of what has happened. James Beatty was \nnominated by President Clinton to the Fourth Circuit, rated well \nqualified by the ABA. He had no hearing and no vote. Do you know how \nlong his nomination languished up here? Three years. Do you suppose he \nknows a little something about delay?\n  Robert Cindrich, nominated to the Third Circuit, found well qualified \nby the ABA; he didn't get a hearing and certainly no vote. Not a \nhearing and not a vote. He would know something about delay, I guess.\n  H. Alston Johnson, nominated to the Fifth Circuit by the previous \nadministration, was rated well qualified by the ABA. He never got a \nhearing or a vote. His nomination was up here 696 days. He never got a \nhearing, never got a vote.\n  The question is, Why? It was the previous administration that sent \nthem up, and those who controlled the Judiciary Committee at that point \ndidn't want to provide a hearing or a vote. I suppose that is a \nfilibuster in its effect, isn't it?\n  James Duffy, a Ninth Circuit Court nominee, was up here for 640 days. \nWell qualified by the ABA, no hearing, no vote.\n  The list is fairly lengthy. I shall not go through it all. Kathleen \nLewis, nominated by the Sixth Circuit, found well qualified by the ABA; \nno hearing, no vote.\n  These are just a few nominations that came from the President, the \nprevious administration. Those on the other side who want to push Mr. \nEstrada through without our getting the information we have asked of \nhim, those are the same Senators who blocked all of these other \nnominees. They didn't get to the floor or get a hearing, let alone a \nvote in the committee. Not even a hearing, for gosh sakes. So we \nunderstand a little about facing delay.\n  Some of these delays, as you know, stretched to 4 full years, with \nnot even a hearing. I find it interesting that people here who talk \nabout delay are those who took nominations from the previous \nadministration and said: They are irrelevant as far as we are \nconcerned. We don't even intend to hold a hearing.\n  Well, Mr. Estrada got a hearing. I think Mr. Estrada would get a vote \non the floor of the Senate, as soon as he provided the information he \nhas been requested to provide. The ranking member of the Judiciary \nCommittee and the minority leader have sent a letter and said here is \nwhat he has not provided. It is a lifetime appointment. Provide the \ninformation and let us move forward. I think that is what we ought to \ndo.\n  I am not part of a filibuster. I have only spoken one time previously \non the floor about Mr. Estrada. It is not a filibuster, as far as I am \nconcerned.\n  I just don't think the Senate ought to vote on a nominee for a \nlifetime appointment to the Federal bench--whether it is a circuit \ncourt or any court--if the nominee says: I am sorry, I don't intend to \nanswer your questions.\n  Here is a question posed to Miguel Estrada: What are several Supreme \nCourt rulings over a good many years with which you disagree, and why?\n  Is that a reasonable thing to ask somebody who aspires to serve on \nthe Federal bench? I think so, and most other nominees have answered \nthat question. The nominee I was proud to support for the western \ndistrict judgeship in North Dakota didn't object to that. I thought he \nanswered that question easily and with good judgment, which gave me \nsome comfort about that nominee.\n  Mr. Estrada won't answer that question. I just don't think there is \nan inherent right--certainly there is no inherent requirement in the \nConstitution--that we move forward and cast a vote on a nominee that \nhas not yet provided the information that has been requested of him.\n  This nomination should not yet be on the floor of the Senate. It \nought to be in the Judiciary Committee, and the nominee ought to not \nhave his name brought to the floor until he has satisfied the members \nof the Judiciary Committee with respect to the information they are \nrequesting. The information they are requesting is not unusual, not \nextraordinary. It is information that has been requested of others and \nprovided by others. And with respect to this lifetime appointment, my \nfeeling is the country will be best served if we decide as a Senate not \nto treat lifetime appointments to the Federal bench in a trifling way.\n  It is a trifling way if we say to people, by the way, if your \nnomination comes before this Senate, you can just get by with saying: I \ndon't intend to answer your questions. I don't have answers to your \nquestions. We don't need to have that dialogue. You have a \nresponsibility to vote because the President sent the nomination down \nto the Senate.\n  Well, as I have described, those who ran the Judiciary Committee \nduring the last administration felt no such obligation. They created a \nspecial ``jail'' for nominees, and nominations went into that jail and \nthe door was locked forever. A good many of them were very well-\nqualified men and women, and they didn't even get a hearing, let alone \na vote. So I don't think we ought to be lectured by anybody about \ndelays and about tactics that somehow injure a nominee.\n  Plenty of nominees have been derailed unjustifiably, in my judgment. \nIt is not my intention in any way to derail the nomination of Mr. \nEstrada. It is my intention as one Member of the Senate to insist--yes, \nto demand--that a nominee who expects a Senate to consider his or her \nnomination provide the information requested by the Senate.\n  The minute this nominee complies with the request of the ranking \nmember of the Judiciary Committee, the former chairman of the \ncommittee, for information that was requested on behalf of the members \nof the minority on the committee and on behalf of dozens of Members in \nthe Senate, I think that nomination should be on the floor of the \nSenate, and we should have a vote. Until then, I do not think we ought \nto.\n  I have voted now for, I believe, well over 100 Federal judges \nsubmitted to this Senate by President Bush. I believe I have voted \nagainst only one. With respect to the two Republicans nominated in \nNorth Dakota, I have been a strong supporter. I have spoken in the \ncommittee and on the floor in support of their nominations.\n  I do not think anyone can take a look at me and say I am trying to \nobstruct anything. I am not. I think I am pretty clear-headed on these \nmatters. But I do not feel an obligation to vote on anybody until we \nget the information requested of them, especially for a lifetime \nappointment. That is clear-headed. That is common sense. And the Senate \nwill rue the day it decides it is all right for nominees to come to the \nSenate and simply say: I am going to stonewall; I do not provide \ninformation; I do not answer questions. That will not, and should not, \nbe the rule of the day with respect to considering lifetime \nappointments.\n\n\n                    HYDROGEN ECONOMY AND FUEL CELLS\n\n  Mr. President, one of the problems with having the Estrada nomination \non the floor for a great length of time is that there are so many other \nmatters we ought to be working on.\n\n[[Page S2731]]\n\n  President Bush, in his State of the Union speech and his subsequent \nappearance a week later in Washington, DC, talked about the need to \nmove to a hydrogen economy and fuel cells as a way of extending \nAmerica's energy independence, making us less dependent on foreign \nenergy. I support this idea, and I would much rather we all discuss \nthat issue on the floor of the Senate, rather than being at parade rest \non the Estrada nomination.\n  We import over one-half of the oil that we use--20 million barrels a \nday. Here are our top sources of imported oil: No. 1 is Saudi Arabia; \nVenezuela is No. 4; Iraq is No. 6. These and other of our top suppliers \nare beset by turmoil.\n  The fact is, it makes no sense for our economy to be this dependent \non foreign sources of energy, and yet we will always be that dependent \nunless we do something about transportation. Let me describe why, using \nthis chart.\n  In this country today, the transportation sector is the sector for \nthe great majority of our imported oil. And as one can see, the total \ndemand for oil is increasing. This line is moving steadily upward. As \none can see, the transportation demand is what is driving it; that is, \nputting gasoline through our carburetors. And we have done that for a \ncentury. Nothing has changed. With the Model T Ford, they pulled up to \na pump and pumped gas. With a 2003 Ford, you pull up to a pump and pump \ngas. Nothing has changed in almost a century.\n  If we do not do something about this demand, this line will continue \nto go up. We will dramatically increase our dependence on foreign oil, \nand our economy will be held hostage to things we cannot control.\n\n  As you can see from this press release that the White House issued, \nwe import 55 percent of our oil, and that is expected to grow to 68 \npercent by 2025. Nearly all of our cars and trucks run on gasoline. \nTwo-thirds of the 20 million barrels of oil we use each day is used for \ntransportation, and one-third of it comes from a troubled part of the \nworld. Does this make any sense to anybody?\n  What the President said--and I fully agree--is we ought to move to a \nhydrogen economy and fuel cells. He proposed a $1.2 billion program, \nthough only $700 million of that is new money. I think that is too \ntimid, not bold enough, but it is definitely a step in the right \ndirection.\n  What is that right path? The right path, it seems to me, is to see if \nwe can find a way to power America's transportation fleet in a \ndifferent manner.\n  There is a new book written by Jeremy Rifkin called ``The Hydrogen \nEconomy,'' that discusses the possibility of using hydrogen as a fuel, \nto radically transform our economy. The fact is, hydrogen is \nubiquitous. Hydrogen is everywhere. It is in water. Electrolysis can \nseparate hydrogen and oxygen from water, and you can use that hydrogen \nin a fuel cell to power an electric engine, an electric motor, power a \nvehicle.\n  When we use hydrogen fuel cells to power a vehicle, we put only water \nvapor out the tailpipe. What a wonderful thing.\n  Now the hydrogen has to be obtained using other energy sources, but \nwe can use every source available to us. We can use fossil fuels, coal, \nnatural gas, but also renewable sources, like wind and solar. By using \nhydrogen as a fuel, we make the most efficient use of every \ndomestically available fuel source, and what comes out of the tailpipe \nof a fuel cell vehicle is water vapor. Boy, that makes a lot of sense. \nThe quicker we get to that point, the better.\n  That does not mean abandoning oil, natural gas, and coal for some \nlong while. But if digging and drilling is our only strategy with \nrespect to our future energy supply, then our energy program is \nsomething I call yesterday forever, and it is not an energy program \nthat makes this country secure, that does what we need to do to be \nreasonably independent with respect to energy sources.\n  When President Bush moves us in this direction, I say absolutely: I \nam with you; let's do this. I say let's be bolder than he suggests. \nLet's be less timid. Let's develop an Apollo-type project, a real \nproject, a big project. With the Apollo project, we said we were going \nto put a man on the Moon at the end of a decade. Let's do an Apollo-\ntype project where we agree that in the next 5, 10, 15 years we are \ngoing to convert America's vehicle fleet to hydrogen economy and fuel \ncells. We can do that. We cannot do that if we are timid, but we can \nset goals, and commit the necessary resources.\n  The goal we ought to set for this country is to have a period, \nwhether it is 10, 15, or 20 years out, in which we have a large number \nof vehicles that are hydrogen vehicles and fuel cell vehicles.\n  I am going to introduce a piece of legislation that is a robust \nApollo-type project, with $6.5 billion invested over 10 years, and with \nspecific goals. I would like 2.5 million vehicles on the roads by the \nyear 2020 that use fuel cells and hydrogen.\n  Last year when we wrote the energy bill in the Senate, we passed a \nprovision that I authored, which said that we should have 2.5 million \nfuel-cell vehicles on the road in this country by the year 2020.\n  The fact is we already have some cars running on fuel cells. We had a \ndemonstration car go from Los Angeles to New York. I have driven \ndemonstration fuel-cell cars.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, will my colleague yield for a unanimous \nconsent request?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Certainly, I will yield for a question.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I understand, Mr. President, that there has already been \na request that Senator Specter immediately follow Senator Dorgan. I \nhaven't had a chance to speak in the last few days. I ask unanimous \nconsent that I be allowed to follow Senator Specter when he finishes \nhis remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Chair.\n  I thank my colleague. I think what he is doing on these fuel-cell \ncars is great and the way to the future. I commend him for his bill.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I began talking about the Estrada \nnomination, about how we wish we could resolve that, and turn to other \nimportant issues.\n  I think this issue of fuel-cell vehicles and a hydrogen economy is \nsomething we will deal with in an energy bill. I visited with Senator \nDomenici, who is now chairman of the Energy Committee, and my colleague \nSenator Bingaman as well, the ranking member, about this issue.\n  Now, I want to show my colleagues that this fuel cell technology is \nnot pie in the sky. Here is a fuel-cell vehicle--a Ford Focus \nproduction-ready prototype introduced in the autumn of 2002. And this \nis a fuel-cell vehicle at the hydrogen fueling station. PowerTech \nLaboratories created this infrastructure for fueling, which, of course, \nyou have to have if you are going to have these kinds of vehicles.\n  This next chart shows a Nissan X-Terra fueled by compressed hydrogen \nand tested on public roads in California in the year 2001.\n  Finally, this is the General Motors Hy-Wire Fuel Concept Car unveiled \nin August 2002.\n  The fact is we can do this and should do this as a country, but it \nwon't happen unless we make it happen. That is the point of my \nlegislation.\n  The Director of Environmental Affairs at Daimler Chrysler has said \nthat political support is vital for the car industry to make inroads in \nfuel cell technology. They can do a lot themselves, but at a certain \npoint they need legislative and financial support to stimulate this \nimportant sector. For that, they need the Government. The European \nUnion has already earmarked 2 billion euros for research over the next \n5 years. The central focus will be hydrogen fuel cells.\n  This is a big idea. This is something our country needs to do. It is \nthe equivalent of going to the Moon by the end of the decade, as John \nF. Kennedy proposed.\n  President Bush is right to propose an initiative in this area. I was \npleased to support him. I was working with him a year ago. We had in \nthe energy bill goals that I had set. I am convinced we will make much \nmore progress this year.\n  At a recent hearing, I asked officials from the Department of Energy \nwhat kind of vision we have for the year 2025 or 2050 about the type of \nfuel we are\n\n[[Page S2732]]\n\ngoing to use in American vehicles. The answer was they didn't have a \nguess. I said: That is interesting. We project out 25 to 50 years and \ntalk about what kind of financial circumstances will exist for Social \nSecurity or Medicare. But we have no such goals with respect to the \nenergy? The answer was: No, we don't really have that kind of planning.\n  It is long past time to start that kind of planning. This country \nneeds a big idea. The President has proposed an approach that I \nsupport. It is something I have worked on for the last couple of years. \nI think by working together--Republicans and Democrats--we can embrace \na big idea and move in a very significant way to improve America's \nenergy future to make our country less dependent--less dangerously \ndependent--on foreign sources of energy. That is my goal.\n  It is not my goal to turn my back on coal, oil, and natural gas. The \nfact is the leaders in this effort in this hydrogen economy and in the \nmove to this hydrogen economy will be many of the utility companies and \nthe energy companies of today.\n  They are the ones in the forefront--United Technologies, Shell, BP. I \ncould go on and name at great length the companies that are involved in \nthis right now at the front end. They are going to be the leaders.\n  I just think this is the right thing to do. It is important for our \ncountry to establish goals. If ever we needed to think about the \nfragile nature of this American economy, it is now. With the threat of \nterrorism, with the problems in the Middle East, and with the potential \nwar against Iraq, we ought to be thinking: do we want to depend for \nover half of our oil from areas of the world that are troubled areas? \nIf not, let us do something about it, and do it now, and let us do it \ntogether.\n  That is why I am introducing my bill, setting forth $6.5 billion over \na 10-year period, so that we will establish and reach ambitious goals, \nin partnership with the private sector, and with the support, I hope, \nof the President of the United States. I think we can do this, and I \nthink if we do it, it will be extraordinarily helpful to this country.\n\n\n                           The Trade Deficit\n\n  Mr. President, one of the other issues I wanted to come to the floor \nand talk about is the issue of the trade deficit. I think this is a \nvitally important issue, and I wish my colleagues and I were debating \nthis at length, rather than continuing to dwell on the Estrada matter.\n  On Thursday last, the Commerce Department announced that our trade \ndeficit was at a record for the year 2002. Our country's deficit in \ngoods last year was $470 billion. That means we sold $470 billion less \nto other countries than we purchased from other countries. What does \nall that mean?\n  This chart shows that our trade deficit has exploded since 1991, a \nlittle over a decade ago--and our merchandise trade deficit is now $470 \nbillion. When the Washington Post reported that on the day it was \nannounced, they finally said, it will put a significant damper on U.S. \neconomic growth. Now, the Washington Post is not in the habit of \nsounding the alarm about the trade deficit. You cannot get them to \nprint an op-ed on that subject. They have a rosy view of trade, and \nview everyone who raises these questions as some sort of isolationist \nxenophobes. But here is the Washington Post, in its report last week, \nsaying that the record deficit will put a significant damper on \neconomic growth. They noted that a combination of increasing imports \nand falling exports clipped a half of a percentage point off the \nincrease in GDP last year.\n\n  The Post further reported that nearly one-fourth of the year's trade \ndeficit was with China, which sold $103 billion more in goods to the \nUnited States than we were able to sell there. I will speak about China \nin a couple of moments, but China is by no means the only country with \nwhich we have a trade deficit.\n  This chart shows we have a trade deficit with nearly every country \nwith whom we do business. One notable exception is Australia, but I \nthink that is going to get remedied because our trade negotiators are \nnow negotiating a free trade agreement with Australia, and our trade \nnegotiators are able to lose almost immediately when they negotiate \ntrade agreements.\n  Will Rogers once said the United States of America has never lost a \nwar and has never won a conference. He surely must have been talking \nabout our trade negotiators.\n  So every time we have a new trade agreement, it ends up hurting us \nand helping those with whom we reach the agreement. I guess we are \nfixing to do an agreement with Australia so perhaps our positive trade \nbalance with Australia will be gone soon.\n  This chart, sourced from the Department of Commerce, shows that with \nvirtually every major trading partner we have a very large trade \ndeficit. Our deficit with Canada now is $50 billion; deficits with \nMexico, $37 billion. Before our negotiators went to negotiate with \nCanada and Mexico and created this trade agreement, which I thought was \na terrible agreement and sold out certain American interests in \nexchange for other benefits, we had a reasonably modest trade deficit \nwith Canada and a small trade surplus with Mexico. We have managed to \nturn that into a huge deficit with Canada and a very large deficit with \nMexico.\n  We have deficits with every major Asian country except Singapore. We \nhave deficits with the major economies of Latin America.\n  Not only do we have deficits with virtually all of our major trading \npartners, we also have deficits in about every major sector of goods \ntrade. A $110 billion deficit in vehicle trade--vehicles, mind you--a \n$47 billion deficit in consumer electronics; a $58 billion deficit in \nclothing, for example.\n  Some might say agriculture is a bright spot, isn't it, because we are \na net exporter of agricultural goods? But even our modest surplus on \nagricultural products has now been reduced by 30 percent, just over the \nlast year, from $14.2 billion to $10.9 billion in 2002. Our surplus in \nmeats declined by $1 billion. Our deficit in livestock trade reached \n$1.5 billion. Our deficit in vegetables and fruits reached $2.5 \nbillion.\n  I mentioned trade with China. We have a deficit with China of $103 \nbillion.\n  One innocent sounding sector in which we have a trade deficit with \nChina is toys. We have a trade deficit of $14 billion with China in the \narea of toys. Now, let me describe a news report that I read last year, \nabout conditions in a Chinese toy factory.\n  The story is entitled ``Worked Till They Drop. Few Protections For \nChina's New Laborers.''\n\n       On the night she died, Li Chunmei must have been exhausted. \n     Co-workers said she had been on her feet for nearly 16 hours, \n     running back and forth inside the toy factory, carrying toy \n     parts from machine to machine.\n\n  This was the busy season before Christmas.\n\n       The factory food was so bad, she said, she felt as if she \n     had not eaten at all. Long hours were mandatory, and at least \n     2 months had passed since Li and other workers had enjoyed \n     even a Sunday off. ``I want to quit,'' one of her roommates \n     remembered her saying. ``I want to go home.'' Her roommates \n     had fallen asleep when Li started coughing up blood. They \n     found her in the bathroom a few hours later, curled up on the \n     floor, moaning softly in the dark, bleeding from her nose and \n     mouth.\n\n  She died before she could arrive at a hospital. The exact cause of \nher death remains unknown, they say.\n  What happened to her last November is described by family and friends \nand coworkers as an example of what China's more daring newspapers have \nactually given a name. They call it ``guolaosi.'' The phrase means \n``overwork death.'' They actually have a name for it in China. It \nusually applies to young workers who suddenly collapse and die after \nworking exceedingly long hours day after day.\n  Think of it. Think of working 16-hour days with no day off, \ninadequate food, in unsafe factories, working children to death in a \ncountry where they do it often enough so there is actually a name for \nit.\n  Is this the sort of playing field that our manufacturers should be \ncompeting in? With children working long hours, for months on end, for \nvirtually no money?\n  There is another reason, of course, for our trade deficit with China, \nand that is our markets are open to virtually all of their products, \nand their markets are not open to ours. The Washington Times ran an \narticle documenting many of the trade barriers that China puts up to \nour products, particularly the agricultural products. It quotes the \nAmerican Farm Bureau, which says the Chinese market is no\n\n[[Page S2733]]\n\nmore open today than it was when China entered the WTO.\n  At the end of the WTO negotiations, China was a $2 billion market. We \nexpected substantial growth, the Farm Bureau says, but we have not seen \nthat growth because China has not done what it was supposed to do.\n  Trade barriers are as numerous as they are creative. Import \nregulations are nearly impossible to figure out. Health inspection \nstandards have changed one month to the next, and it goes on and on.\n  The bottom line is our agricultural products are not getting into \nChina. China is a country of 1.3 billion people, and they have a $103 \nbillion trade surplus with us, or we a deficit with them. That story in \nthe Washington Times tells us another reason why.\n  One does not have to travel as far as China to find closed markets \nfor U.S. products. We have a $50 billion trade deficit with Canada. In \n2002, for example, our deficit with Canada was $90 million in durum \nwheat, $160 million in spring wheat. It is pretty easy to calculate \nthat. Do you want to know why? Because our exports to Canada in these \nareas in wheat are zero. You cannot get it in. I know that personally \nbecause I have been on a truck trying to get through the border into \nCanada with 200 bushels of durum wheat, watching all the Canadian durum \nship south on the trip north, and we were stopped at the border.\n  On February 15 of last year, the USTR found that Canada was guilty of \nunfair trade, but they said: We will not impose tariff rate quotas. In \nthe absence of tariff rate quotas, one recent study says, U.S. wheat \nproducers lost $124 million in sales in the last crop year.\n  On April 19, I held a hearing in the Commerce subcommittee I then \nchaired and talked to agriculture negotiator Ambassador Allen Johnson \nand said: We need to take action now. I showed him an article in the \nBismarck Tribune where the Canadian Wheat Board president was gloating \nsaying USTR had not imposed tariff rate quotas on Canadian wheat. \nTherefore, they have won. Since the USTR's decision on February 15, \nlast year, enough wheat has come in from Canada to fill 50,000 18-wheel \ntrucks, and the Canadians have not changed their practices at all.\n  Are farmers upset about that? You are darn right they are. They do \nnot think anybody stands up for them or speaks out for them, and they \nare sick and tired of it.\n  We also have a trade deficit with the European Union of $82 billion. \nOne area that is a chronic problem is beef. They will not allow \nAmerican beef into the European Union. They claim that our beef is made \nwith dangerous growth hormones, even though there is no evidence that \nsuch beef is bad for people.\n  So they have decided that this is what livestock in America looks \nlike: a two-headed cow. Therefore, $100 million in U.S. beef is banned \nfrom the EU each year.\n  Now, we go to the WTO and we get a ruling against the Europeans. What \ndoes that mean? Nothing. It does not mean a thing. So then our country \ntakes action against the Europeans. Do you know what we do to the \nEuropeans? We take action against European truffles, goose liver, and \nRoquefort cheese. Now, my God, that is enough to scare the devil out of \nany country. Truffles, goose liver, and Roquefort cheese.\n  Let's talk about Korea. The year 2001, the last year for which I have \nfigures, Korea sent 618,000 automobiles into our country; we were able \nto get 2,800 cars into Korea. I repeat that because people think that \ncannot be right. Korea shipped us 618,000 automobiles made in Korea and \nwe were able to get 2,800 U.S. vehicles into the Korean marketplace. \nWhy? Because Korea does not want American vehicles in their \nmarketplace. End of story. We have a $13 billion trade deficit with \nKorea. If you do not like to talk automobiles, let's talk about potato \nflakes, the ingredient they use for snack food, and on which they \nimpose a 300-percent tariff.\n  The list goes on and on. I have not even talked about Japan. We have \nhad a deficit with them forever. It has gone on and on and on. We had a \ndeficit with them when the dollar was strong, when the dollar was weak, \nwhen we were growing, when we were in recession, it does not matter.\n  All of these countries have decided they will use the American \nmarketplace for their benefit and keep American goods out of their \nmarketplace for their benefit. The result is the American consumers pay \nthe price. Some say it is good for consumers that we have all of this \ntrade deficit because this means cheap foreign goods coming in. But our \nconsumers are also people who work. And when you lose your job, which \nis the result of a trade deficit that is $470 billion, when you lose \nyour job, your time as a consumer is just about over.\n  One can make a case, I suppose, that the Federal budget deficit is \nmoney we owe to ourselves. Some economists make that case. You cannot \nmake that case with respect to the trade deficit. That is money we owe \nto others outside of this country and will be repaid, inevitably will \nbe repaid, with a lower standard of living someday in this country.\n  Just once I want our trade negotiators and want this administration \nand future administrations to stand up for this country's interests. \nNo, not to put a wall around this country. But I would like for this \ncountry to believe that its trade policies are in this country's best \ninterests. And they have not been. NAFTA has not been. The United \nStates-Canada FTA was not. The WTO is not.\n  Just look at the bilateral we did with China--do you know what our \nnegotiators did with China 2 years ago? They sat down, always in \nsecret, and then the door opened, and they trumpeted this new \nagreement. Do you know what they agreed to with the Chinese? After a \nphase-in period, we will agree that we will have a tariff on Chinese \nautomobiles that come to the United States that is only one-tenth of \nthe tariff we allow the Chinese to allow on U.S. vehicles that go to \nChina. Our negotiators agreed that we would allow the Chinese to have \nten times larger tariffs against U.S. automobiles going to China.\n  I don't know who agreed to that. I would love to get a name. But \nthese are amorphous groups of people who go over and meet in secret and \nthey lose a trade agreement the minute they sit down with another \ncountry.\n  Harry Truman used to say, I want a one-armed economist because they \nalways say on the one hand this, on the other hand that. I want one \neconomist who supported all the trade agreements we have had to come \nforward and make a case that this has worked.\n  It is not working. It is hurting this country. No country will long \nremain a world power without a strong manufacturing sector. And our \nmanufacturing sector is being sucked out of the middle of this country.\n  When they talked about NAFTA, with U.S. and Mexican trade, they said \nU.S.-Mexican trade will all be the product of low-skilled labor coming \nfrom Mexico to the United States. That is what we will get from Mexico. \nNot true. Not true at all. The three largest imports from Mexico, \nincluding the maquiladora area, are automobiles, automobile parts, and \nelectronics, the product of high-skilled labor. You can see what is \nhappening in this country as a result of these trade agreements.\n  Just once I would like to see somebody stand up for this country's \nproducers and its interests. I know a lot of companies that you think \nof as American companies like these trade agreements. And the chambers \nof commerce and others that support them support these agreements. Why? \nBecause they are really multinational, international companies. They \nthink this is just fine. Take a jet, fly around the world, look down on \nthe ground and see where you can produce for 14 cents, hire 14-year-\nolds and work them 14 hours a day. Where can you do that? And then ship \nthe product back to Toledo, Bismarck, Los Angeles, or Denver? Where can \nyou do that? It is about profit, not about strengthening our country. \nIt is about international profit.\n  I care about this country's long-term economic interests. A $470 \nbillion trade deficit, especially given the circumstances that exist \nwith those with whom we have that deficit--Japan, Europe, Korea, China, \nCanada, Mexico--shame on us for deciding this is acceptable. It is not \nacceptable. In the long term it will hurt every child in this country \nwho grows up and experiences a lower standard of living because we\n\n[[Page S2734]]\n\ndid not have the guts to decide we would demand fair trade with other \ncountries.\n  Fair trade means if we cannot compete, that is our fault. But fair \ntrade insists that the rules be fair. And no American worker and no \nAmerican company ought to have to compete against someone that wants to \nhire 14-year-olds and work them 14 hours a day.\n  You say it does not happen? I will give you names. Of course it \nhappens. It happens all the time, all over the world. No American \nshould have to compete against a company that decided to renounce its \ncitizenship, moved its headquarters on paper to Bermuda to avoid paying \nU.S. corporate income tax, and then moved its production to yet a third \ncountry, somewhere where they can dump chemicals into the water and \nchemicals into the area and run a factory that is unsafe, where they \nhire kids. No American should have to compete against that. It is not \nfair competition, and at some point, in some way, some day, someone \nwill say this is not in our interest.\n  It is in our interest to encourage expanded trade; that clearly is in \nour interest. On behalf of those who produce in this country and who \nwork in production in this country, it is in our interest to demand \nfair trade rules. Globalization has galloped far ahead of the rules of \ntrade and no one is willing to admit it or do anything about it. And it \nis injuring this country, inevitably injuring this country.\n  The question is, When will we have a real debate about it? You can \nput on a blindfold and listen. You can listen to Democratic Presidents \nand Republican Presidents and you will not hear a bit of difference on \ninternational trade. For 20 years, we have had the same mindless mantra \nabout this trade. And when I finish this speech, some will say that I \nam a protectionist, a xenophobic isolationist protectionist, someone \nwho just does not get it.\n  Well, I get it. What I get is I have seen the unfairness that is \nundermining American farmers, American manufacturers, American \nbusinesses, and it ought to stop. The only way it will stop is if we \nhave someone, someplace, somewhere who has the guts to stand up and \nstop it.\n  We had a vote in this Chamber recently on something called fast \ntrack. They called it trade promotion authority, which is just a goofy \nway of putting some new clothing on a old, bad deal--fast track. I \nvoted against it. I would not give it to President Clinton. I would not \ngive it to President George H.W. Bush. I did not think either of them \nshould have it.\n\n  President George W. Bush now has fast-track authority. What does that \nmean? That trade agreements are being negotiated in secret somewhere \naround the world, and when they are done negotiating, they will be \nbrought back to this Chamber for a straight up-or-down vote. Fast track \nmeans that no one in this Chamber, under any circumstances, at any \ntime, will ever be able to offer an amendment to strike out an \noffending provision, to strike out something we think inherently \ninjures this country. Nobody will be able to offer the amendment. Why? \nBecause we decided to handcuff ourselves. I have no idea why Members of \nthe Senate think we ought to be doing that. And it is exactly what we \nhave done.\n  So this, unfortunately, is not going to get better. It is going to \nget worse, unless enough of us decide in this country that American \njobs are important, that yes, globalism is here, but the rules of \nglobalism must keep pace, and we must insist and demand fair trade. We \nmust demand that other countries open their markets in exchange for an \nadmission to the American marketplace. All of these things are \nconditions that are inherent to the well-being and stability of this \ncountry's future.\n  I am obviously frustrated, from time to time, about trade issues \nbecause no one seems to care. There is a sense that there are only two \nsides: There are the expansionists and the protectionists. That is \nfundamentally wrong. There are people like me who believe in expanded \ntrade, but believe, on behalf of the things we fought for for a century \nin this country, that such expanded trade needs to be done with fair \nrules.\n  We fought for a century, I would say, for people to have the right to \ngo into a factory that is safe, to have a safe workplace. We fought for \na long while about preventing people from dumping chemicals into \nstreams and the air. People lost their lives demonstrating on the \nstreets for the right to be able to collectively bargain.\n  And now we decide that did not matter much, just skip all that, and \npole-vault over it all and move your plant, in fact, renounce your \ncitizenship while you are at it, become a Bermuda paper company so you \ndo not even pay your taxes.\n  Bermuda has a navy that has 26 people. Maybe the next time a U.S. \ncompany that decides to become a Bermuda paper company, and they are in \ntrouble, and someone wants to expropriate their assets, maybe they \nought to call on the Bermudan Navy. Maybe that is where they ought to \nget their protection.\n  I am going to come back and speak at some greater length on trade. \nThis is such an important issue.\n  I represent a State that produces agricultural products, for which we \nmust find a foreign home for a sizable portion of it. I am not anti-\ntrade. I very strongly support expanded trade. But I am sick and tired \nof this country being taken advantage of. I am sick and tired of seeing \nwheat farmers being injured by bad agreements and by bad practices that \nyou can't stop. And the same is true with the textile workers. And the \nsame is true for those who manufacture aircraft. It just goes on and \non. We have a responsibility to stop it.\n  We should be a world leader and say we support globalization and \nworld trade, providing the rules are fair. The rules are not fair. We \nought to say, we, by God, are going to change them. We have to be the \nleader that changes those rules to make sure we have a fair chance at a \nworld trade regime that is beneficial not just to those with whom we \ntrade, but beneficial to this country as well.\n  So I will continue this at a later time. I did tell my colleague that \nI would be finished at about this time. I thank him for his patience.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to support the \nconfirmation of Miguel Estrada to be a judge for the Court of Appeals \nfor the District of Columbia Circuit.\n  We are seeing a Democratic filibuster, which essentially constitutes \na revolution on the advice and consent process. It is unprecedented. \nWhat we are seeing is the culmination of 41 opposition Senators holding \nthe judicial confirmation process hostage.\n  The advice and consent function has traditionally been structured \nwhere the President makes the nomination and, unless there is some \nreason to oppose, some objection, some basis for opposition, the \nconfirmation follows.\n  In this situation there is no reason not to confirm Mr. Estrada. He \nhas an extraordinary academic background. Phi Beta Kappa, magna cum \nlaude from Columbia; magna cum laude from Harvard Law School. He was on \nthe Harvard Law Review. He argued 15 cases before the Supreme Court of \nthe United States. He is the member of a distinguished law practice. He \nhas had service as an Assistant Solicitor General. This is a great \nAmerican success story of a man coming from a very humble background \nand achieving real success, with real credentials for the court of \nappeals.\n  The opponents to Mr. Estrada have contended that he has not answered \nquestions to their satisfaction in the Judiciary Committee hearing. I \nsuggest that a fair reading of the record shows the contrary.\n  Nominees are not supposed to give their opinions or judgments on \nhypothetical cases or in matters which may come before the court. The \njudicial process works so that cases in controversy depend upon the \nspecific facts. Then briefs are submitted to the court. Then there is \noral argument before the court. Then the judges deliberate, talk among \nthemselves, reflect on the case, ultimately come to a judgment, write \nan opinion, and express themselves as to their conclusions.\n  That is a very different matter from someone being asked: What is \nyour judgment on issue A? What is your judgment on issue B? How would \nyou find on issue C? The judicial process does not function that way.\n  Traditionally, nominees have been accorded an understanding that they \ndo not have to answer such questions.\n\n[[Page S2735]]\n\n  It is commonplace for questions to be asked. And I refer now to the \nconfirmation hearings of Merrick Garland, where I asked now-Judge \nGarland:\n\n       Do you favor, as a personal matter, capital punishment?\n\n  Mr. Garland:\n\n       That is really a matter of settled law now. The Court has \n     held that capital punishment is constitutional, and lower \n     courts are required to follow that rule.\n\n  There was an extended discussion which followed, but the upshot of \nthe matter was that Mr. Garland--now Judge Garland--did not give his \nviews. And I accepted that. He said that it was a matter of established \nlaw, and as a lower court judge he would be obliged to follow the law.\n  There was a very controversial nominee, now Judge Marsha Berzon. She \nwas asked about her view on Roe v. Wade and her thoughts about the \nabortion issue. And Marsha Berzon responded:\n\n       I'm bound by Casey in that regard.\n\n  That is referring to the case of Casey v. Planned Parenthood. And \nMarsha Berzon was a nominee by President Clinton, as was Judge Garland \na nominee by President Clinton.\n  When the shoe was on the other foot, these nominees did not give \nanswers to these questions, but responded in the traditional way. And \nthey were confirmed.\n  Judge Rogers was questioned by Senator Cohen and asked about \nconstitutional interpretation, where Senator Bill Cohen said:\n\n       This is an evolutionary interpretation of what was \n     originally defined at least in the Constitution. Would you \n     agree with that general statement?\n\n  Judge Rogers responded, ``My job as an appellate judge is to apply \nprecedent.''\n  And so it goes with the tradition being established that nominees do \nnot answer specific questions.\n  Mr. Estrada has agreed to make himself available to talk to any \nSenator who wishes to talk to him and to respond to inquiries and to \nhave a discussion as to his judicial qualifications and answer \nquestions consistent with appropriate practice. I think that is \nsufficient, certainly in the context where Mr. Estrada has already had \nhis hearing by the Judiciary Committee and has been reported out.\n  There has been an effort to obtain the legal papers of Miguel Estrada \nwhen he worked as an Assistant Solicitor General. I say with all due \nrespect that that kind of contention is a red herring. Seven former \nSolicitors General wrote to the then chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, Senator Leahy, outlining this issue in a succinct way. \nReading the letter would express it as briefly as it can be expressed. \nSolicitors General Seth Waxman, a Democrat, Walter Dellinger, a \nDemocrat, Drew Days, a Democrat, Kenneth Starr, a Republican, Charles \nFried, a Republican, Robert H. Bork, a Republican, Archibald Cox, a \nDemocrat--a four to three balance for Democrats--wrote as follows:\n\n       We write to express our concern about your recent request \n     that the Department of Justice turn over ``appeal \n     recommendations, certiorari recommendations and amicus \n     recommendations'' that Miguel Estrada worked on while in the \n     Office of Solicitor General. As former heads of the Office of \n     Solicitor General, we can attest to the vital importance of \n     candor and confidentiality in the Solicitor General's \n     decision-making process. The Solicitor General is charged \n     with weighing responsibility, of deciding whether to appeal \n     adverse decisions in cases where the United States is a \n     party, whether to seek Supreme Court review of adverse \n     appellate decisions, and whether to participate as amicus \n     curiae and other high-profile cases that implicate an \n     important Federal interest. The Solicitor General has the \n     responsibility of representing the interests not just of the \n     Justice Department nor just of the executive branch but of \n     the entire Federal Government, including Congress. It goes \n     without saying that when we make these and other critical \n     decisions we rely on frank, honest, and thorough advice from \n     our staff attorneys, such as Mr. Estrada. Our decision-making \n     process requires the unbridled, open exchange of ideas, and \n     exchange simply cannot take place if attorneys have reason to \n     fear that their private recommendations are not private at \n     all but vulnerable to public disclosures. Attorneys \n     inevitably will hesitate before giving their honest, \n     independent analysis if their opinions are not safeguarded \n     from future disclosures. High-level decision-making requires \n     candor, and candor in turn requires confidentiality. Any \n     attempt to intrude into the office's highly privileged \n     deliberations would come at the cost of the Solicitor \n     General's ability to defend vigorously the U.S. litigation \n     interests, a cost that would also be borne by Congress \n     itself. Although we profoundly respect the Senate's duty to \n     evaluate Mr. Estrada's fitness for the Federal judiciary, we \n     do not think that the confidentiality and integrity of \n     internal deliberations should be sacrificed in the \n     process.\n\n  It is signed by four former Democratic Solicitors General for \nDemocratic Presidents who were Democrats, and three former Solicitors \nGeneral who served in that capacity for Republican Presidents.\n  What is really happening here is that the advise and consent function \nis being turned into an advise and dissent function. Beyond the \nqualifications of Mr. Estrada to be on the Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia Circuit, this is obviously a preliminary battle \nfor the next nominee to the Supreme Court of the United States.\n  I emphasize the issue of the unprecedented nature of this challenge \nand this procedure where 41 Senators can hold the confirmation process \nhostage. In order to cut off debate--to get what we call cloture--60 \nvotes are required. So as long as 41 Senators of the opposition party \nvote against cloture, the nomination process cannot go forward and \nthere cannot be an up-or-down vote on a nominee.\n  It has been said many times that if the opponents of Mr. Estrada seek \nto vote him down, let them do so. But it is plain that there are more \nthan 51 Senators who are ready to vote to confirm Miguel Estrada. It is \nreported that some 55 Senators are prepared to vote for cloture. If \nthis process goes on long enough, I think it is true that 60 votes \nwould be obtained, cloture would be invoked, debate would be cut off, \nand there would be a vote on Miguel Estrada and he would be confirmed.\n  But this lengthy process comes at the expense of very important other \nbusiness of the Senate. The minority leader appeared in the Chamber \nearlier this week and asked to proceed to a discussion of the economy, \nwhich is a very important subject. That was obviously a tactic to make \na point of trying to get off of Estrada and going to something else. \nBut we should conclude Estrada not by way of removing the nomination \nfrom the floor but by way of voting on Miguel Estrada and then moving \non to other very important items.\n  There are very important issues which this Senate has to consider--an \neconomic stimulus package, the prospects of a war in Iraq, and the \nissue of terrorism, which I am going to speak about in a few minutes. \nBut right now, there is a stranglehold on the Senate with both sides \nhaving dug in.\n  I will concede that when President Clinton was in the White House and \nwe Republicans controlled the Senate that we did not give due deference \nto Presidential nominees. The record is also plain that I was willing \nto and did support Democratic nominees who were qualified. Other \nRepublicans did as well. When we had a majority in the Judiciary \nCommittee, we voted out nominees who were Democrats.\n  It is my hope that one day we will find a resolution to this issue by \nestablishing a protocol where the practice is established that so many \ndays after a nomination is submitted there is a hearing in the \nJudiciary Committee; some days later, there is a vote by the committee; \nso many days after that, there is a floor debate and a vote by the \nSenate could be extended.\n  On the most controversial nomination we have had during my tenure, \nthe nomination of Justice Clarence Thomas, which was decided on the 52-\nto-48 vote with a lot of acrimonious debate remembered well in this \nChamber although it was back in October of 1991, the opposition party \ndid not resort to a filibuster. In 1991, the Senate was controlled by \nthe Democrats. They had a majority of the Senators. Justice Thomas was \nconfirmed 52 to 48 in a very hotly contested, very partisan, very \ncontroversial nomination.\n  Now to move to Miguel Estrada to be on the lower court, the District \nof Columbia Circuit Court, and with a matter of his qualifications, is \nsending the confirmation process into turmoil from which it may never \nrecover, or if it does recover it is going to be a very long time. The \nfallout on this issue goes beyond the nomination process but to the \nessence of collegiality and the workings of the Senate, which is very \nmuch to the detriment of this\n\n[[Page S2736]]\n\nbody and very much to the detriment of the American people whom we are \nsupposed to serve.\n  It is my hope that we yet might be able to come to some \naccommodation--not on Miguel Estrada but on the broader issues where we \ncan have a protocol and establish a procedure that is not partisan, not \npolitical.\n  We ought to take the judicial nominating process out of politics so \nthat when you have a Republican President and a Senate controlled by \nthe Democrats, or a President who is a Democrat with a Senate \ncontrolled by the Republicans, we do not get into a logjam. And now we \nhave a President who is a Republican and a Senate controlled by the \nRepublicans, but as long as there are 41 who will stand up and oppose \nand filibuster, then the entire process breaks down.\n\n\n                               Terrorism\n\n  Mr. President, I intend to talk on another subject. I have gotten the \nacquiescence of the chairman of the committee, Senator Hatch. This is \nnot about the Estrada nomination that we are generally talking about, \nalthough Senators have talked about other subjects. The subject I am \nnow going to discuss is a matter of great national importance. It \nrelates to a report that was issued yesterday by Senator Leahy, Senator \nGrassley, and myself. It is in reference to the issue of terrorism.\n  The Judiciary Committee is scheduled to have a hearing next Tuesday, \nand there are matters that require discussion so that we are in a \nposition to get responses from the Director of the FBI and move ahead \nwith the Judiciary Committee hearings scheduled, as I said, for next \nTuesday.\n  Yesterday, as a matter of senatorial oversight, Senator Leahy, \nSenator Grassley, and I released a 37-page report that deals with the \nissue of the FBI's activities under the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act (``FISA'') and the ability of the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation and the Department of Justice to handle counterterrorism. \nThe report can be found on my office's internet website at \nspecter.senate.gov.\n  It is my view that there is a critical issue of the FBI's competence \nto handle terrorism, in light of the clear-cut failures of the FBI \nprior to 9/11, and the FBI's failure to answer important questions \nabout what the FBI has done to correct the current failures.\n  The report we released yesterday refers to the FBI's handling of the \nfamous Phoenix memorandum, where there was a suspicious person who was \ntaking flight training in the Phoenix area, and he had a big picture of \nOsama bin Laden on his wall. A detailed FBI report was submitted to \nWashington and was lost in the shuffle at FBI headquarters.\n  At pages 31-32 of the report that we filed yesterday, there is a \nreference to the Phoenix memo. Had it been forwarded to the right \npersonnel and understood at FBI headquarters, the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act request in the Moussaoui case from the Justice \nDepartment's Office of Intelligence Policy and Review would have been \nhandled in a different manner. With that Phoenix report, coupled with \nthe information from Zacarias Moussaoui's computer, and coupled with \nother information, 9/11 might well have been prevented.\n  There was information in the hands of the Central Intelligence Agency \nabout individuals in Kuala Lampur, Malaysia, who later turned out to be \namong the hijackers on 9/11--information that was not turned over to \nthe Immigration and Naturalization Service. Had it been turned over, \nthose individuals would have been kept out of the United States and \nwould not have been hijackers on 9/11.\n  There had been information as early as 1996 from a Pakistani named \nAbdul Hakim Murad, an al-Qaida member, who had plans to fly an airplane \ninto the White House or CIA headquarters.\n  Had the information on Zacarias Moussaoui been properly handled, it \ncould have led to a FISA search authorization for Moussaoui's computer \nand the information contained on that computer, and might well have \nprevented 9/11.\n\n  The Zacarias Moussaoui case received national prominence when a \nconscientious FBI agent named Coleen Rowley wrote a 13-page, single-\nspaced letter to the FBI Director, which the Judiciary Committee \nultimately saw and was the subject of a very important Judiciary \nCommittee hearing last June 6. FBI Agent Rowley was honored on the \ncover of Time Magazine as one of the persons of the year--three so-\ncalled whistleblowers, which is a categorization that doesn't sound too \ncomplimentary on its face, but it is very important when somebody knows \nwhat is going on within the Government that is wrong and has the \ncourage to stand up and expose it and subject himself or herself to \nretaliation.\n  But in the course of what Agent Rowley wrote to FBI Director Mueller, \nit was apparent the FBI was applying the wrong standard for a warrant \nunder the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.\n  The letter from Agent Rowley pointed out that they were being held to \na standard of preponderance of the evidence--meaning more likely or \nmore probable than not--meaning 51 percent or more. In the course of \nthat hearing, I raised with Director Mueller and with Agent Rowley the \ncase of Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 1983, which appears at pages \n23-24 of the report that Senators Leahy, Grassley, and I released \nyesterday, which defined probable cause as ``circumstances which \nwarrant suspicion'' under the ``totality of the circumstances \nanalysis.''\n  This case was decided in 1983 and it referred back to an opinion of \nChief Justice Marshall in 1813. So this had been the law for a long \ntime. But at the hearing, Agent Rowley testified that was not the \nstandard that was used, and there is a real question which has yet to \nbe answered as to whether FBI Director Mueller knew what the right \nstandard was.\n  In light of the fact that a warrant was not obtained under the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act, Moussaoui, a key participant in \nthe 9/11 planning, developed into a burgeoning, very major case in the \nUnited States in the intervening months. We then proceeded to have a \nclosed-door session, where we brought in attorneys and personnel from \nthe FBI who were in charge of handling warrants under the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act. This appears at page 27.\n  My questioning:\n\n       What is the legal standard for probable cause for a \n     warrant?\n\n  FBI attorney:\n\n       A reasonable belief that the facts you are trying to prove \n     are accurate.\n\n  Question by me:\n\n       Reason to believe?\n\n  Answer by the attorney:\n\n       Reasonable belief.\n\n  Question by me:\n\n       Reasonable belief?\n\n  Answer by the attorney:\n\n       More probable than not.\n\n  My question:\n\n       More probable than not?\n\n  Mr. President, that is not the standard. The standard is suspicion \nunder the totality of the circumstances. Here is the key attorney who \nis supposed to pass on applications for warrants under the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act, and he doesn't know the standard.\n  My question was:\n\n       Are you familiar with Gates v. Illinois?\n\n  Answer:\n\n       No, sir.\n\n  He doesn't know the baseline case for deciding what the standard is \nfor probable cause, and he is the man who is supposed to approve \nwarrants under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act so that we can \nfind out what men like Zacarias Moussaoui are doing and protect the \nAmerican people.\n  I was absolutely astounded at what I heard. I was astounded because \nthe June 6 hearings, more than a month before we had this closed-door \nsession on July 9, were widely publicized. They were on C-SPAN. Maybe \nnobody watches C-SPAN. Maybe nobody is watching C-SPAN now. Maybe \nnobody ever watches C-SPAN. But beyond being publicized on C-SPAN, \nthere was extensive newspaper coverage about it. One would have \nexpected that the agents who deal with the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act would be looking at a hearing which was squarely on \ntheir subject. Or one would also expect that the Director of the FBI, \nwho was at the hearing, and found that key FBI personnel had applied \nthe wrong standard in the Zacarias Moussaoui case--causing them not to \napply for a search warrant--that the\n\n[[Page S2737]]\n\nFBI Director would take specific steps to see to it that the people in \ncharge of handling those warrant applications would have known what was \ngoing on.\n  From June 6 to July 9 is 33 days. The world could turn in 33 days. \nPeople could be doing highly suspicious things, people could be \nplanning terrorist attacks, and no action was taken by the Director of \nthe FBI to see to it that the people who were charged with the \nresponsibility of applying for these warrants did so.\n  The very next day, I wrote to the Director of the FBI:\n\n       Dear Bob, In a hearing before the Judiciary Committee on \n     June 6 . . . I called your attention to the standard on \n     probable cause in the opinion of then-Associate Justice \n     Rehnquist in Illinois v. Gates. . . .\n\n  I go through the business about suspicion and totality of the \ncircumstances. My letter continues:\n\n       In a closed door hearing yesterday, seven FBI personnel \n     handling FISA warrant applications were questioned, including \n     four attorneys.\n       A fair summary of their testimony demonstrated that no one \n     was familiar with Justice Rehnquist's definition from Gates \n     and no one articulated an accurate standard for probable \n     cause.\n       I would have thought that the FBI personnel handling FISA \n     applications would have noted this issue from the June 6th \n     hearing; or, in the alternative, that you or other \n     supervisory personnel would have called it to their \n     attention.\n       It is obvious that these applications, which are frequently \n     made, are of the utmost importance to our national security \n     and your personnel should not be applying such a high \n     standard that precludes submission of FISA applications to \n     the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.\n       I believe the Judiciary Committee will have more to say on \n     this subject but I wanted to call this to your attention \n     immediately so that you could personally take appropriate \n     corrective action.\n\n  Days followed, weeks followed, and no response from Director Mueller.\n  Then on September 10, I again raised these issues with a \nrepresentative of the Department of Justice who appeared before the \nJudiciary Committee. On September 12, I received an undated letter \nsigned by the Assistant Director for the Office of Public and \nCongressional Affairs. It is very unusual to get undated letters. The \nrepresentation has been made that the letter was sent on July 25, but \nit was received in my office on September 12.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my letter to Director \nMueller dated July 10 and the undated response from John E. Collingwood \nbe printed in the Congressional Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Reserving the right to object--and I am not going to \nobject--I want to get a time line. My friend has important things to \nsay. How much longer does my colleague from Pennsylvania--if he will \nyield for a question--expect to hold the floor?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I will not say regular order, but there is no basis for \nthe inquiry, but I will respond. I expect to be about 15 minutes more.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my colleague. I am trying to work out our \nschedule. I have no objection, of course. I am very interested in what \nmy colleague has to say.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the FBI then put out a memorandum dated \nSeptember 16. That was in response to my questioning the Department of \nJustice representative at the Judiciary Committee hearings on September \n10. Again, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this memorandum \nbe printed in the Congressional Record following my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I will not read the memo or analyze it in \ndetail, but I invite readers of the Congressional Record to do so. This \nis a virtually unintelligible memorandum, if agents are supposed to \nread this and know what to do about applications for warrants under the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act.\n  In paragraph 3, it talks about ``which deal with probabilities.'' It \nmakes a reference to ``it requires more than unfounded suspicion,'' but \nit is not probabilities that involve the standards, it is suspicion. \nObviously, not unfounded suspicion, but suspicion based on a totality \nof the circumstances.\n  At that stage, I again wrote to Director Mueller noting the questions \nwhich I had propounded to him and Special Agent Coleen Rowley on June 6 \nand the July 10 letter which I wrote to him which had still not been \nanswered. This undated letter from John E. Collingwood provides no \nanswer at all. I will not read it in detail, but it will be in the \nRecord.\n  The closest the letter from John E. Collingwood, the Assistant \nDirector for the Office of Public and Congressional Affairs, comes is:\n\n       This guidance will also address the concerns raised in your \n     letter in your meeting with FBI personnel on July 9, 2002. We \n     anticipate approval of the guidance shortly and will \n     immediately disseminate it to field offices for \n     implementation.\n\n  That is as close as they come to an answer which, obviously, on its \nface is no answer at all.\n  So I again wrote Director Mueller on September 24, 2002. I referenced \nthe July 10 letter, and I referenced the fact that on September 12, my \noffice received an undated letter from Assistant Director Collingwood \nwhich was totally unresponsive. I referenced the September 16 FBI memo, \nand concluded by saying I would like an explanation from him as to why \nit took the FBI so long to disseminate information on the standard for \nprobable cause under Illinois v. Gates for a Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act warrant. As yet, I have not received an answer from \nFBI Director Mueller to that important question as to why it took so \nlong.\n  Then I supplemented that letter on October 1, inquiring what were the \nspecifics on the standard of probable cause used by the FBI for \nwarrants under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act from June 6, \nthe date of our Judiciary Committee hearing, until September 16, when \nthe memorandum went out. As yet, I have not gotten an answer to that \nletter.\n  I ask unanimous consent that both of those letters be printed at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  In the sequence of events, we next sent over to the FBI the report \nwhich we issued yesterday to give them an opportunity to review it and \nan opportunity to make comments. Finally, last Friday, February 21, \n2003, we received another letter dated February 20 from the Department \nof Justice which referenced the outstanding questions--not sent to me, \nthe person who had raised the questions, but sent to Senator Hatch, \nwith a copy to me--and ending with the statement of what standard had \nbeen applied. The letter is signed by Acting Assistant Attorney General \nJamie E. Brown:\n\n       The standard they employed was consistent with ``Illinois \n     v. Gates'' both before and after they received the \n     memorandum.\n\n  That is patently false. The standard which had been employed before \nthe memorandum was more probable than not, 51 percent, as testified by \nSpecial Agent Coleen Rowley, and it is undetermined as to what standard \nwas used thereafter.\n  The issues under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act have been \nraised in other oversight hearings relating to Wen Ho Lee, when the \nDepartment of Justice, on a matter handled by Attorney General Janet \nReno personally, declined to request a warrant under the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act where there was ample probable cause, a \nmatter which was reviewed in depth by the subcommittee which I chaired \non Department of Justice oversight.\n  The Attorney General designated Assistant U.S. Attorney Randy Bellows \nto review the Wen Ho Lee case. Mister Bellows filed an extensive report \non May 12, 2000, saying that Attorney General Reno was wrong and the \nsubcommittee of the Judiciary Committee was correct that a warrant \nshould have been issued.\n  Just in the last few weeks, an indictment has been returned, charging \nMr. Sami Al-Arian for gathering funds for terrorist organizations since \nthe early 1990s, an indictment based on extensive evidence collected \npursuant to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, raising a real \nquestion as to the interpretation by the FBI and the Department of \nJustice of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, going back to Wen \nHo Lee, going back to the 1990s, and surviving up until very recently, \nwhen they failed to utilize the provisions of the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act for criminal prosecutions.\n\n[[Page S2738]]\n\n  Prior to the enactment of the PATRIOT Act in the fall of 2001, the \nstandard for Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act surveillance had \nbeen interpreted by the courts to be that the primary purpose for the \nsurveillance had to be for intelligence gathering, but saying ``primary \npurpose'' left latitude for some law enforcement purpose.\n\n  Then the PATRIOT Act amended the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \nAct standards to say ``significant purpose,'' broadening to some extent \nthe issue of using Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrants for \nlaw enforcement purposes. So in that substance, there is a persistent \nquestion as to the activities of the Department of Justice in \nimplementing the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, passed in 1978, \nat a time when gathering information and evidence against terrorists is \nof the utmost importance for the security of the American people.\n  In our oversight hearing which we conducted last July 9, and in \nsubsequent hearings and correspondence, we asked the Department of \nJustice for an opinion written by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \nCourt, which the Department of Justice declined to give us. We finally \nhad to get it from the court itself. In that matter, the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Court criticized the Department of Justice \nand the FBI for some 75 cases where, as the court put it, the \napplications for search warrants had contained substantial \ninaccuracies. Then there was an appeal taken, the first such appeal, \nwhere the Court of Appeals for the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \nAct found that there was broader discretion for law enforcement, which \nwas very important in the war against terrorism.\n  All of this is very complicated, and I have gone to some length to \nput this into the Record.\n  I ask unanimous consent, on behalf of Senator Leahy, Senator \nGrassley, and myself, that the full text of the report issued yesterday \nbe printed in the Record. As I noted earlier, the report can also be \nfound on my office's website at specter.senate.gov.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Interim Report on FBI Oversight: FISA Implementation Failures\n\n\n                  I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\n\n       Working in a bipartisan manner in the 107th Congress, the \n     Senate Judiciary Committee conducted the first comprehensive \n     oversight of the FBI in nearly two decades. That oversight \n     was aimed not at tearing down the FBI but at identifying any \n     problem areas as a necessary first step to finding \n     constructive solutions and marshaling the attention and \n     resources to implement improvements. The overarching goal of \n     this oversight was to restore confidence in the FBI and make \n     the FBI as strong and as great as it must be to fulfill this \n     agency's multiple and critical missions of protecting the \n     United States against crime, international terrorism, and \n     foreign clandestine intelligence activity, within \n     constitutional and statutory boundaries.\n       Shortly after the Committee initiated oversight hearings \n     and had confirmed the new Director of the FBI, the Nation \n     suffered the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the \n     most serious attacks on these shores since Pearl Harbor. \n     While it is impossible to say what could have been done to \n     stop these attacks from occurring, it is certainly possible \n     in hindsight to say that the FBI, and therefore the Nation, \n     would have benefitted from earlier close scrutiny by this \n     Committee of the problems the agency faced, particularly as \n     those problems affected the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \n     Act (``FISA'') process. Such oversight might have led to \n     corrective actions, as that is an important purpose of \n     oversight.\n       In the immediate aftermath of the attacks, the Congress \n     and, in particular, the Senate Judiciary Committee responded \n     to demands by the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the FBI for \n     greater powers to meet the security challenges posed by \n     international terrorism. We worked together to craft the USA \n     PATRIOT Act to provide such powers. With those enhanced \n     powers comes an increased potential for abuse and the \n     necessity of enhanced congressional oversight.\n       Our oversight has been multi-faceted. We have held public \n     hearings, conducted informal briefings, convened closed \n     hearings on matters of a classified nature, and posed written \n     questions in letters in connection with hearings to the DOJ \n     and FBI. Although our oversight has focused primarily on the \n     FBI, the Attorney General and the DOJ have ultimate \n     responsibility for the performance of the FBI. Without both \n     accountability and support on the part of the Attorney \n     General and senior officials of the DOJ, the FBI cannot make \n     necessary improvements or garner the resources to implement \n     reforms.\n       At times, the DOJ and FBI have been cooperative in our \n     oversight efforts. Unfortunately, however, at times the DOJ \n     and FBI have either delayed answering or refused to answer \n     fully legitimate oversight questions. Such reticence only \n     further underscores the need for continued aggressive \n     congressional oversight. Our constitutional system of checks \n     and balances and our vital national security concerns demand \n     no less. In the future, we urge the DOJ and FBI to embrace, \n     rather than resist, the healthy scrutiny that legitimate \n     congressional oversight brings.\n       One particular focus of our oversight efforts has been the \n     Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). This report is \n     focused on our FISA oversight for three reasons. First, the \n     FISA is the law governing the exercise of the DOJ's and FBI's \n     surveillance powers inside the United States to collect \n     foreign intelligence information in the fight against \n     terrorism and, as such, is vitally important to our national \n     security. Second, the concerns revealed by our FISA oversight \n     highlight the more systemic problems facing the FBI and the \n     importance of close congressional oversight and scrutiny in \n     helping to provide the resources and attention to correct \n     such problems before they worsen. Third, members of this \n     Committee led the effort to amend key provisions of the FISA \n     in the USA PATRIOT Act, and the sunset or termination of \n     those amendments in four years makes it imperative that the \n     Committee carefully monitor how the FISA changes are being \n     implemented.\n       This report is in no way intended to be a comprehensive \n     study of what did, or did not, ``go wrong'' before the 9/11 \n     attacks. That important work was commenced by the Joint \n     Intelligence Committee in the 107th Congress and will be \n     continued by the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks \n     (the ``9/11 Commission'') established by an act of Congress \n     at the end of the last session. The focus of this report is \n     different than these other important inquiries. We have not \n     attempted to analyze each and every piece of intelligence or \n     the performance of each and every member of the Intelligence \n     Community prior to the 9/11 attacks. Nor have we limited our \n     inquiry to matters relating only to the 9/11 attacks. Rather, \n     we have attempted, based upon an array of oversight \n     activities related to the performance of the FBI over an \n     extended period of time, to highlight broader and more \n     systemic problems within the DOJ and FBI and to ascertain \n     whether these systemic shortcomings played a role in the \n     implementation of the FISA prior to the 9/11 attacks.\n       The FISA provides a statutory framework for electronic and \n     other forms of surveillance in the context of foreign \n     intelligence gathering. These types of investigations give \n     rise to a tension between the government's legitimate \n     national security interests, on the one hand, and, on the \n     other hand, constitutional safeguards against unreasonable \n     government searches and seizures and excessive government \n     intrusion into the exercise of free speech, associational, \n     and privacy rights. Congress, through legislation, has sought \n     to strike a delicate balance between national security and \n     constitutionally protected interests in this sensitive \n     arena.\n       The oversight review this Committee has conducted during \n     the 107th Congress has uncovered a number of problems in the \n     FISA process: a misunderstanding of the rules governing the \n     application procedure, varying interpretations of the law \n     among key participants, and a break-down of communication \n     among all those involved in the FISA application process. \n     Most disturbing is the lack of accountability that has \n     permeated the entire application procedure.\n       Our FISA oversight--especially oversight dealing with the \n     time leading up to the 9/11 attacks--has reinforced the \n     conclusion that the FBI must improve in the most basic \n     aspects of its operations. Following is a list of our most \n     important conclusions:\n       FBI Headquarters did not properly support the efforts of \n     its field offices in foreign intelligence matters. The role \n     of FBI Headquarters in national security investigations is to \n     ``add value'' in two ways: by applying legal and practical \n     expertise in the processing of FISA surveillance applications \n     and by integrating relevant information from all available \n     intelligence sources to evaluate the significance of \n     particular information and to supplement information from the \n     field. In short, Headquarters' role is to know the law and \n     ``connect the dots'' from multiple sources both inside and \n     outside the FBI. The FBI failed in this role before the 9/11 \n     attacks. In fact, the bureaucratic hurdles erected by \n     Headquarters (and DOJ) not only hindered investigations but \n     contributed to inaccurate information being presented to the \n     FISA Court, eroding the trust in the FBI of the special court \n     that is key to the government's enforcement efforts in \n     national security investigations.\n       Key FBI agents and officials were inadequately trained in \n     important aspects of not only FISA, but also fundamental \n     aspects of criminal law.\n       In the time leading up to the 9/11 attacks, the FBI and DOJ \n     had not devoted sufficient resources to implementing the \n     FISA, so that long delays both crippled enforcement efforts \n     and demoralized line agents.\n       The secrecy of individual FISA cases is certainly \n     necessary, but this secrecy has been extended to the most \n     basic legal and procedural aspects of the FISA, which should \n     not be secret. This unnecessary secrecy contributed to the \n     deficiencies that have hamstrung the implementation of the \n     FISA.\n\n[[Page S2739]]\n\n     Much more information, including all unclassified opinions \n     and operating rules of the FISA Court and Court of Review, \n     should be made public and/or provided to the Congress.\n       The FBI's failure to analyze and disseminate properly the \n     intelligence data in the agency's possession rendered useless \n     important work of some of its best field agents. In short, \n     the FBI did not know what it knew. While we are encouraged by \n     the steps commenced by Director Mueller to address this \n     problem, there is more work to be done.\n       The FBI's information technology was, and remains, \n     inadequate to meet the challenges facing the FBI, and FBI \n     personnel are not adequately trained to use the technology \n     that they do possess. We appreciate that Director Mueller is \n     trying to address this endemic problem, but past performance \n     indicates that close congressional scrutiny is necessary to \n     ensure that improvements continue to be made swiftly and \n     effectively.\n       A deep-rooted culture of ignoring problems and discouraging \n     employees from criticizing the FBI contributes to the FBI's \n     repetition of its past mistakes in the foreign intelligence \n     field. There has been little or no progress at the FBI in \n     addressing this culture.\n       It is important to note that our oversight and conclusions \n     in no way reflect on the fine and important work being done \n     by the vast majority of line agents in the FBI. We want to \n     commend the hard-working special agents and supervisory \n     agents in the Phoenix and Minneapolis field offices for their \n     dedication, professionalism, and initiative in serving the \n     American people in the finest traditions of the FBI and law \n     enforcement. Indeed, one of our most basic conclusions, both \n     with respect to FISA and the FBI generally, is that \n     institutional and management flaws prevent the FBI's field \n     agents from operating to their full potential.\n       Although the DOJ and FBI have acknowledged shortcomings in \n     some of these areas and begun efforts to reform, we cannot \n     stress strongly enough the urgency of this situation. The \n     pace of improvement and reform must quicken.\n       We are issuing this interim public report now so that this \n     information is available to the American people and Members \n     of Congress as we evaluate the implementation of the USA \n     PATRIOT Act amendments to the FISA and additional pending \n     legislation, including the FBI Reform Act. We also note that \n     many of the same concerns set forth in this report have \n     already led to legislative reforms. Included in these was the \n     bipartisan proposal, first made in the Senate, to establish a \n     cabinet level Department of Homeland Security, a proposal \n     that is already a legislative reality. Our oversight also \n     helped us to craft and pass, for the first time in 20 \n     years, the 21st Century Department of Justice \n     Appropriations Authorization Act, P.L. 107-296, designed \n     to support important reforms at the Department of Justice \n     and the FBI. In addition, concerns raised by this \n     Committee about the need for training on basic legal \n     concepts, such as probable cause, spurred the FBI to issue \n     an electronic communication on September 16, 2002, from \n     the FBI's Office of the General Counsel to all field \n     offices explaining this critical legal standard.\n       Additionally, this report may assist the senior leadership \n     of the DOJ and FBI, and other persons responsible for \n     ensuring that FISA is used properly in defending against \n     international terrorists.\n\n\n          II. OVERVIEW OF FBI OVERSIGHT IN THE 107th CONGRESS\n\n A. The Purposes of FBI Oversight: Enhancing Both Security and Liberty\n\n       Beginning in the summer of 2001 and continuing through the \n     remainder of the 107th Congress, the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee conducted intensive, bipartisan oversight of the \n     FBI. The purpose of this comprehensive oversight effort was \n     to reverse the trend of the prior decades, during which the \n     FBI operated with only sporadic congressional oversight \n     focused on its handling of specific incidents, such as the \n     standoffs at Ruby Ridge, Idaho, or Waco, Texas, and the \n     handling of the Peter Lee and Wen Ho Lee espionage cases. It \n     was the view of both Democrats and Republicans on the \n     Judiciary Committee that the FBI would benefit from a more \n     hands-on approach and that congressional oversight would help \n     identify problems within the FBI as a first step to ensuring \n     that appropriate resources and attention were focused on \n     constructive solutions. In short, the goal of this oversight \n     was to ensure that the FBI would perform at its full \n     potential. Strong and bipartisan oversight, while at times \n     potentially embarrassing to any law enforcement agency, \n     strengthens an agency in the long run. It helps inform the \n     crafting of legislation to improve an agency's performance, \n     and it casts light on both successes and problems in order to \n     spur agencies to institute administrative reforms of their \n     own accord. In short, the primary goal of FBI oversight is to \n     help the FBI be as great and effective as it can be.\n       So, too, is oversight important in order to protect the \n     basic liberties upon which our country is founded. Past \n     oversight efforts, such as the Church Committee in the 1970s, \n     have exposed abuses by law enforcement agencies such as the \n     FBI. It is no coincidence that these abuses have come after \n     extended periods when the public and the Congress did not \n     diligently monitor the FBI's activities. Even when agencies \n     such as the FBI operate with the best of intentions (such as \n     protecting our nation from foreign threats such as Communism \n     in the 1950s and 1960s and fighting terrorism now), if left \n     unchecked, the immense power wielded by such government \n     agencies can lead them astray. Public scrutiny and debate \n     regarding the actions of government agencies as powerful as \n     the DOJ and the FBI are critical to explaining actions to the \n     citizens to whom these agencies are ultimately accountable. \n     In this way, congressional oversight plays a critical role in \n     our democracy.\n       The importance of the dual goals of congressional \n     oversight--improving FBI performance and protecting liberty--\n     have been driven home since the 9/11 attacks. Even prior to \n     the terrorist attacks, the Judiciary Committee had begun \n     oversight and held hearings that had exposed several \n     longstanding problems at the FBI, such as the double standard \n     in discipline between line agents and senior executive \n     officials. The 9/11 attacks on our country have forever \n     redefined the stakes riding upon the FBI's success in \n     fulfilling its mission to fight terrorism. It is no luxury \n     that the FBI perform at its peak level--it is now a \n     necessity.\n       At the same time, the increased powers granted to the FBI \n     and other law enforcement agencies after the 9/11 attacks, in \n     the USA PATRIOT Act, which Members of this Committee helped \n     to craft, and through the actions of the Attorney General and \n     the President, have made it more important than ever that \n     Congress fulfills its role in protecting the liberty of our \n     nation. Everyone would agree that winning the war on \n     terrorism would be a hollow victory indeed if it came only at \n     the cost of the very liberties we are fighting to preserve. \n     By carefully overseeing the DOJ's and FBI's use of its broad \n     powers, Congress can help to ensure that the false choice \n     between fundamental liberty and basic security is one that \n     our government never takes upon itself to make. For these \n     reasons, in the post-9/11 world, FBI oversight has been, and \n     will continue to be, more important than ever.\n\n B. Judiciary Committee FBI Oversight Activities in the 107th Congress\n\n                1. Full Committee FBI Oversight Hearings\n\n       Beginning in July 2001, after Senator Leahy became \n     chairman, the Senate Judiciary Committee held hearings that \n     focused on certain longstanding and systemic problems at the \n     FBI. These included hearings concerning: (1) the FBI's \n     antiquated computer systems and its belated upgrade program; \n     (2) the FBI's ``circle the wagons'' mentality, wherein those \n     who report flaws in the FBI are punished for their frankness; \n     and (3) the FBI's flawed internal disciplinary procedures and \n     ``double standard'' in discipline, in which line FBI agents \n     can be seriously punished for the same misconduct that only \n     earns senior FBI executives a slap on the wrist. Such flaws \n     were exemplified by the disciplinary actions taken (and not \n     taken) by the FBI and DOJ after the incidents at Waco, Texas, \n     and Ruby Ridge, Idaho, and the apparent adverse career \n     effects experienced by FBI agents participating in those \n     investigations who answered the duty call to police their \n     own.\n       The Committee's pre-9/11 FBI oversight efforts culminated \n     with the confirmation hearings of the new FBI Director, \n     Robert S. Mueller, III. Beginning on July 30, 2001, the \n     Committee held two days of extensive hearings on Director \n     Mueller's confirmation and closely questioned Director \n     Mueller about the need to correct the information technology \n     and other problems within the FBI. In conducting these \n     hearings, Committee Members understood the critical role of \n     the FBI Director in protecting our country from criminal, \n     terrorist, and clandestine intelligence activities and \n     recognized the many challenges facing the new Director.\n       Director Mueller was questioned very closely on the issue \n     of congressional oversight, engaging in four rounds of \n     questioning over two days. In response to one of Senator \n     Specter's early questions, Director Mueller stated ``I \n     understand, firmly believe in the right and the power of \n     Congress to engage in its oversight function. It is not only \n     a right, but it is a duty.''\n       In response to a later question, Director Mueller stated:\n       ``I absolutely agree that Congress is entitled to oversight \n     of the ongoing responsibilities of the FBI and the Department \n     of Justice. You mentioned at the outset the problems that you \n     have had over a period of getting documents in ongoing \n     investigations. And as I stated before and I'll state again, \n     I think it is incumbent upon the FBI and the Department of \n     Justice to attempt to accommodate every request from Congress \n     swiftly and, where it cannot accommodate or believes that \n     there are confidential issues that have to be raised, to \n     bring to your attention and articulate with some specificity, \n     not just the fact that there's ongoing investigation, not \n     just the fact that there is an ongoing or an upcoming trial, \n     but with specificity why producing the documents would \n     interfere with either that trial or for some other reason or \n     we believed covered by some issue of confidentiality.''\n       Incoming Director Mueller, at that time, frankly \n     acknowledged that there was room for improvement in these \n     areas at the FBI and vowed to cooperate with efforts to \n     conduct congressional oversight of the FBI in the future.\n       Director Mueller assumed his duties on September 4, 2001, \n     just one week before the terrorist attacks. After the \n     terrorist attacks, there was a brief break from FBI \n     oversight, as the Members of the Judiciary Committee worked \n     with the White House to craft\n\n[[Page S2740]]\n\n     and pass the USA PATRIOT Act. In that new law, the Congress \n     responded to the DOJ's and FBI's demands for increased powers \n     but granted many of those powers only on a temporary basis, \n     making them subject to termination at the end of 2005. The \n     ``sunset'' of the increased FISA surveillance powers \n     reflected the promise that the Congress would conduct \n     vigilant oversight to evaluate the FBI's performance both \n     before and after 9/11. Only in that way could Congress and \n     the public be assured that the DOJ and FBI needed the \n     increased powers in the first place, and were effectively and \n     properly using these new powers to warrant extension of the \n     sunset.\n       Passage of the USA PATRIOT Act did not solve the \n     longstanding and acknowledged problems at the FBI. Rather, \n     the 9/11 attacks created a new imperative to remedy systemic \n     shortcomings at the FBI. Review of the FBI's pre-9/11 \n     performance is not conducted to assess blame. The blame lies \n     with the terrorists. Rather, such review is conducted to help \n     the FBI prevent future attacks by not repeating the mistakes \n     of the past. Thus, the enactment of the USA PATRIOT Act did \n     not obviate the need to oversee the FBI; it augmented that \n     need.\n       Within weeks of passage of the USA PATRIOT Act, the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee held hearings with senior DOJ officials \n     on implementation of the new law and other steps that were \n     being taken by the Administration to combat terrorism. The \n     Committee heard testimony on November 28, 2001, from \n     Assistant Attorney General Michael Chertoff and, on December \n     6, 2001, from Attorney General Ashcroft. In response to \n     written questions submitted in connection with the latter \n     hearing, DOJ confirmed that shortly after the USA PATRIOT Act \n     had been signed by the President on October 26, 2001, DOJ \n     began to press the Congress for additional changes to relax \n     FISA requirements, including expansion of the definition of \n     ``foreign power'' to include individual, non-U.S. persons \n     engaged in international terrorism. DOJ explained that this \n     proposal was to address the threat posed by a single foreign \n     terrorist without an obvious tie to another person, group, or \n     state overseas. Yet, when asked to ``provide this Committee \n     with information about specific cases that support your claim \n     to need such broad new powers,'' DOJ was silent in its \n     response and named no specific cases showing such a need, nor \n     did it say that it could provide such specificity even in a \n     classified setting. In short, DOJ sought more power but was \n     either unwilling or unable to provide an example as to why.\n       Beginning in March 2002, the Committee convened another \n     series of hearings monitoring the FBI's performance and its \n     efforts to reform itself. On March 21, 2002, the Judiciary \n     Committee held a hearing on the DOJ Inspector General's \n     report on the belated production of documents in the Oklahoma \n     City bombing case. That hearing highlighted longstanding \n     problems in the FBI's information technology and training \n     regarding the use of, and access to, records. It also \n     highlighted the persistence of a ``head-in-the-sand'' \n     approach to problems, where shortcomings are ignored rather \n     than addressed and the reporting of problems is \n     discouraged rather than encouraged.\n       On April 9, 2002, the Committee held a hearing on the \n     Webster Commission's report regarding former FBI Agent and \n     Russian spy Robert Hanssen's activities. That hearing exposed \n     a deep-seated cultural bias against the importance of \n     security at the FBI. One important finding brought to light \n     at that hearing was the highly inappropriate handling of \n     sensitive FISA materials in the time after the 9/11 attacks. \n     In short, massive amounts of the most sensitive and highly \n     classified materials in the FBI's possession were made \n     available on an unrestricted basis to nearly all FBI \n     employees. Even more disturbing, this action was taken \n     without proper consultation with the FBI's own security \n     officials.\n       On May 8, 2002, the Judiciary Committee held an oversight \n     hearing at which FBI Director Mueller and Deputy Attorney \n     General Thompson testified regarding their efforts to reshape \n     the FBI and the DOJ to address the threat of terrorism. It \n     was at this hearing that the so-called ``Phoenix Memorandum'' \n     was publicly discussed for the first time. Director Mueller \n     explained in response to one question:\n       ``[T]he Phoenix electronic communication contains \n     suggestions from the agent as to steps that should be taken, \n     or he suggested taking to look at other flight schools . . . \n     . He made a recommendation that we initiate a program to look \n     at flight schools. That was received at Headquarters. It was \n     not acted on by September 11. I should say in passing that \n     even if we had followed those suggestions at that time, it \n     would not, given what we know since September 11, have \n     enabled us to prevent the attacks of September 11. But in the \n     same breath I should say that what we learned from instances \n     such as that is much about the weaknesses of our approach to \n     counterterrorism prior to September 11.''\n       In addition, Director Mueller first discussed at this \n     hearing that FBI agents in Minnesota had been frustrated by \n     Headquarters officials in obtaining a FISA warrant in the \n     Zacharias Moussaoui investigation before the 9/11 attacks, \n     and that one agent seeking the warrant had said that he was \n     worried that Moussaoui would hijack an airplane and fly it \n     into the World Trade Center.\n       On June 6, 2002, the Committee held another hearing at \n     which Director Mueller testified further regarding the \n     restructuring underway at the FBI. Significantly, that \n     hearing also provided the first public forum for FBI Chief \n     Division Counsel Coleen Rowley of the Minneapolis Division to \n     voice constructive criticism about the FBI. Her criticisms, \n     the subject of a lengthy letter sent to Director Mueller on \n     May 21, 2002, which was also sent to Members of Congress, \n     echoed many of the issues raised in this Committee's \n     oversight hearings. Special Agent Rowley testified about \n     ``careerism'' at the FBI and a mentality at FBI Headquarters \n     that led Headquarters agents to more often stand in the way \n     of field agents than to support them. She cited the Moussaoui \n     case as only the most high profile instance of such an \n     attitude. Special Agent Rowley also described a FBI computer \n     system that prevented agents from accessing their own records \n     and conducting even the most basic types of searches. In \n     short, Special Agent Rowley's testimony reemphasized the \n     importance of addressing the FBI's longstanding problems, not \n     hiding from them, in the post-9/11 era.\n       As the head of the Department of Justice as a whole, the \n     Attorney General has ultimate responsibility for the \n     performance of the FBI. On July 25, 2002, the Judiciary \n     Committee held an oversight hearing at which Attorney General \n     Ashcroft testified. The Committee and the Attorney General \n     engaged in a dialogue regarding the performance of the DOJ on \n     many areas of interest, including the fight against \n     terrorism. Among other things discussed at this hearing were \n     the Attorney General's plans to implement the Terrorism \n     Information and Prevention System (TIPS), which would have \n     enlisted private citizens to monitor ``suspicious'' \n     activities of other Americans. After questioning on the \n     subject, Attorney General Ashcroft testified that he would \n     seek restrictions on whether and how information generated \n     through TIPS would be retained. Later, as part of the \n     Homeland Security legislation, TIPS was prohibited \n     altogether.\n       On September 10, 2002, the Committee held an oversight \n     hearing specifically focusing on issues related to the FISA. \n     Leading experts from the DOJ, from academia, and from the \n     civil liberties and national security legal communities \n     participated in a rare public debate on the FISA. That \n     hearing brought before the public an important discussion \n     about the reaches of domestic surveillance using FISA and the \n     meaning of the USA PATRIOT Act. In addition, through the \n     efforts of the Judiciary Committee, the public learned that \n     this same debate was already raging in private. The FISA \n     Court (FISC) had rejected the DOJ's proposed procedure for \n     implementing the USA PATRIOT Act, and the FISA Court of \n     Review was hearing its first appeal in its 20-year-plus \n     existence to address important issues regarding these USA \n     PATRIOT Act amendments to the FISA. The Committee requested \n     that the FISA Court of Review publicly release an \n     unclassified version of the transcript of the oral argument \n     and its opinion, which the Court agreed to do and furnished \n     to the Committee. Thus, only through the bipartisan oversight \n     work of the Judiciary Committee was the public first informed \n     of the landmark legal opinion interpreting the FISA and the \n     USA PATRIOT Act amendments overruling the FISC's position, \n     accepting some of the DOJ's legal arguments, but rejecting \n     others.\n       These are only the full Judiciary Committee hearings \n     related to FBI oversight issues in the 107th Congress. The \n     Judiciary Committee's subcommittees also convened numerous, \n     bipartisan oversight hearings relating to the FBI's \n     performance both before and after 9/11.\n\n 2. Other oversight activities: classified hearings, written requests, \n                         and informal briefings\n\n       The Judiciary Committee and its Members have fulfilled \n     their oversight responsibilities through methods other than \n     public hearings as well. Particularly with respect to FISA \n     oversight, Members of the Judiciary Committee and its staff \n     conducted a series of closed hearings and briefings, and made \n     numerous written inquiries on the issues surrounding both the \n     application for a FISA search warrant of accused \n     international terrorist Zacharias Moussaoui's personal \n     property before the 9/11 attacks and the post-9/11 \n     implementation of the USA PATRIOT Act. As with all of our FBI \n     oversight, these inquiries were intended to review the \n     performance of the FBI and DOJ in order to improve that \n     performance in the future.\n       The Judiciary Committee and its Members also exercised \n     their oversight responsibilities over the DOJ and the FBI \n     implementation of the FISA through written inquiries, written \n     hearing questions, and other informal requests. These efforts \n     included letters to the Attorney General and the FBI Director \n     from Senator Leahy on November 1, 2001, and May 23, 2002, and \n     from Senators Leahy, Specter, and Grassley on June 4, June \n     13, July 3, and July 31, 2002. In addition, these Members \n     sent letters requesting information from the FISA Court and \n     FISA Court of Review on July 16, July 31, and September 9, \n     2002. Such oversight efforts are important on a day-to-day \n     basis because they are often the most efficient means of \n     monitoring the activities of the FBI and DOJ.\n\n                   3. DOJ and FBI non-responsiveness\n\n       Particularly with respect to our FISA oversight efforts, we \n     are disappointed with the non-responsiveness of the DOJ and \n     FBI. Although the FBI and the DOJ have sometimes cooperated \n     with our oversight efforts, often, legitimate requests went \n     unanswered\n\n[[Page S2741]]\n\n     or the DOJ answers were delayed for so long or were so \n     incomplete that they were of minimal use in the oversight \n     efforts of this Committee. The difficulty in obtaining \n     responses from DOJ prompted Senator Specter to ask the \n     Attorney General directly, ``how do we communicate with you \n     and are you really too busy to respond?''\n       Two clear examples of such reticence on the part of the DOJ \n     and the FBI relate directly to our FISA oversight efforts. \n     First, Chairman Sensenbrenner and Ranking Member Conyers of \n     the House Judiciary Committee issued a set of 50 questions on \n     June 13, 2002, in order to fulfill the House Judiciary \n     Committee's oversight responsibilities to monitor the \n     implementation of the USA PATRIOT Act, including its \n     amendments to FISA. In connection with the July 25, 2002, \n     oversight hearing with the Attorney General, Chairman Leahy \n     posed the same questions to the Department on behalf of the \n     Senate Judiciary Committee. Unfortunately, the Department \n     refused to respond to the Judiciary Committee with answers to \n     many of these legitimate questions. Indeed, it was only after \n     Chairman Sensenbrenner publicly stated that he would subpoena \n     the material that the Department provided any response at all \n     to many of the questions posed, and to date some questions \n     remain unanswered. Senator Leahy posed a total of 93 \n     questions, including the 50 questions posed by the leadership \n     of the House Judiciary Committee. While the DOJ responded to \n     56 of those questions in a series of letters on July 29, \n     August 26, and December 23, 2002, thirty-seven questions \n     remain unanswered. In addition, the DOJ attempted to respond \n     to some of these requests by providing information not to the \n     Judiciary Committees, which had made the request, but to the \n     Intelligence Committees. Such attempts at forum shopping by \n     the Executive Branch are not a productive means of \n     facilitating legitimate oversight.\n       Second, the FBI and DOJ repeatedly refused to provide \n     Members of the Judiciary Committee with a copy of the FISA \n     Court's May 17, 2002, opinion rejecting the DOJ's proposed \n     implementation of the USA PATRIOT Act's FISA amendments. This \n     refusal was made despite the fact that the opinion, which was \n     highly critical of aspects of the FBI's past performance on \n     FISA warrants, was not classified and bore directly upon the \n     meaning of provisions in the USA PATRIOT Act authored by \n     Members of the Judiciary Committee. Indeed, the Committee \n     eventually had to obtain the opinion not from the DOJ but \n     directly from the FISA Court, and it was only through these \n     efforts that the public was first made aware of the important \n     appeal being pursued by the DOJ and the legal positions being \n     taken by the Department on the FISA Amendments.\n       In both of these instances, and in others, the DOJ and FBI \n     have made exercise of our oversight responsibilities \n     difficult.\n       It is our sincere hope that the FBI and DOJ will \n     reconsider their approach to congressional oversight in \n     the future. The Congress and the American people deserve \n     to know what their government is doing. Certainly, the \n     Department should not expect Congress to be a ``rubber \n     stamp'' on its requests for new or expanded powers if \n     requests for information about how the Department has \n     handled its existing powers have been either ignored or \n     summarily paid lip service.\n\n\nIII. FISA OVERSIGHT: A CASE STUDY OF THE SYSTEMIC PROBLEMS PLAGUING THE \n                                  FBI\n\n                      A. Overview and Conclusions\n\n       The Judiciary Committee held a series of classified \n     briefings for the purpose of reviewing the processing of FISA \n     applications before the terrorist attacks on September 11, \n     2001. The Judiciary Committee sought to determine whether any \n     problems at the FBI in the processing of FISA applications \n     contributed to intelligence failures before September 11th; \n     to evaluate the implementation of the changes to FISA enacted \n     pursuant to the USA PATRIOT Act; and to determine whether \n     additional legislation is necessary to improve this process \n     and facilitate congressional oversight and public confidence \n     in the FISA and the FBI.\n       We specifically sought to determine whether the systemic \n     problems uncovered in our FBI oversight hearings commenced in \n     the summer of 2001 contributed to any shortcomings that may \n     have affected the FBI counterterrorism efforts prior to the \n     9/11 attacks. Not surprisingly, we conclude that they did. \n     Indeed, in many ways the DOJ and FBI's shortcomings in \n     implementing the FISA--including but not limited to the time \n     period before the 9/11 attacks--present a compelling case for \n     both comprehensive FBI reform and close congressional \n     oversight and scrutiny of the justification for any further \n     relaxation of FISA requirements. FISA applications are of the \n     utmost importance to our national security. Our review \n     suggests that the same fundamental problems within the FBI \n     that have plagued the agency in other contexts also prevented \n     both the FBI and DOJ from aggressively pursuing FISA \n     applications in the period before the 9/11 attacks. Such \n     problems caused the submission of key FISA applications to \n     the FISA Court to have been significantly delayed or not \n     made. More specifically, our concerns that the FBI and DOJ \n     did not make effective use of FISA before making demands on \n     the Congress for expanded FISA powers in the USA PATRIOT Act \n     are bolstered by the following findings:\n       (1) The FBI and Justice Department were setting too high a \n     standard to establish that there is ``probable cause'' that a \n     person may be an ``agent of a foreign power'' and, therefore, \n     may be subject to surveillance pursuant to FISA;\n       (2) FBI agents and key Headquarters officials were not \n     sufficiently trained to understand the meanings of crucial \n     legal terms and standards in the FISA process;\n       (3) Prior problems between the FBI and the FISA Court that \n     resulted in the Court barring one FBI agent from appearing \n     before it for allegedly filing inaccurate affidavits may have \n     ``chilled'' the FBI and DOJ from aggressively seeking FISA \n     warrants (although there is some contradictory information on \n     this matter, we will seek to do additional oversight on this \n     question);\n       (4) FBI Headquarters fostered a culture that stifled rather \n     than supported aggressive and creative investigative \n     initiatives from agents in the field; and\n       (5) The FBI's difficulties in properly analyzing and \n     disseminating information in its possession caused it not to \n     seek FISA warrants that it should have sought. These \n     difficulties are due to:\n       (a) a lack of proper resources dedicated to intelligence \n     analysis;\n       (b) a ``stove pipe'' mentality where crucial intelligence \n     is pigeonholed into a particular unit and may not be shared \n     with other units;\n       (c) High turnover of senior agents at FBI Headquarters \n     within critical counterterrorism and foreign intelligence \n     units;\n       (d) Outmoded information technology that hinders access to, \n     and dissemination of, important intelligence; and\n       (e) A lack of training for FBI agents to know how to use, \n     and a lack of requirements that they do use, the technology \n     available to search for and access relevant information.\n       We have found that, in combination, all of these factors \n     contributed to the intelligence failures at the FBI prior to \n     the 9/11 attacks.\n       We are also conscious of the extraordinary power FISA \n     confers on the Executive branch. FISA contains safeguards, \n     including judicial review by the FISA Court and certain \n     limited reporting requirements to congressional intelligence \n     committees, to ensure that this power is not abused. Such \n     safeguards are no substitute, however, for the watchful \n     eye of the public and the Judiciary Committees, which have \n     broader oversight responsibilities for DOJ and the FBI. In \n     addition to reviewing the effectiveness of the FBI's use \n     of its FISA power, this Committee carries the important \n     responsibility of checking that the FBI does not abuse its \n     power to conduct surveillance within our borders. \n     Increased congressional oversight is important in \n     achieving that goal.\n       From the outset, we note that our discussion will not \n     address any of the specific facts of the case against \n     Zacharias Moussaoui that we have reviewed in our closed \n     inquiries. That case is still pending trial, and, no matter \n     how it is resolved, this Committee is not the appropriate \n     forum for adjudicating the allegations in that case. Any of \n     the facts recited in this report that bear on the substance \n     of the Moussaoui case are already in the public record. To \n     the extent that this report contains information we received \n     in closed sessions, that information bears on abstract, \n     procedural issues, and not any substantive issues relating to \n     any criminal or national security investigation or \n     proceeding. This is an interim report of what we have \n     discovered to date. We hope to and should continue this \n     important oversight in the 108th Congress.\n\n         B. Allegations Raised by Special Agent Rowley's Letter\n\n       The Judiciary Committee had initiated its FISA oversight \n     inquiry several months before the revelations in the dramatic \n     letter sent on May 21, 2002, to FBI Director Mueller by \n     Special Agent Coleen Rowley. Indeed, it was this Committee's \n     oversight about the FBI's counterintelligence operations \n     before the 9/11 attacks that in part helped motivate SA \n     Rowley to write this letter to the Director.\n       The observations and critiques of the FBI's FISA process in \n     this letter only corroborated problems that the Judiciary \n     Committee was uncovering. In her letter, SA Rowley detailed \n     the problems the Minneapolis agents had in dealing with FBI \n     Headquarters in their unsuccessful attempts to seek a FISA \n     warrant for the search of Moussaoui's lap top computer and \n     other personal belongings. These attempts proved fruitless, \n     and Moussaoui's computer and personal belongings were not \n     searched until September 11th, 2001, when the Minneapolis \n     agents were able to obtain a criminal search warrant after \n     the attacks of that date. According to SA Rowley, with the \n     exception of the fact of those attacks, the information \n     presented in the warrant application establishing probable \n     cause for the criminal search warrant was exactly the same as \n     the facts that FBI Headquarters earlier had deemed inadequate \n     to obtain a FISA search warrant.\n       In her letter, SA Rowley raised many issues concerning the \n     efforts by the agents assigned to the Minneapolis Field \n     Office to obtain a FISA search warrant for Moussaoui's \n     personal belongings. Two of the issues she raised were \n     notable. First, SA Rowley corroborated that many of the \n     cultural and management problems within the FBI (including \n     what she referred to as ``careerism'') have significant \n     effects on the FBI's law enforcement and intelligence \n     gathering activities. This led to a perception among the \n     Minneapolis agents that FBI Headquarters personnel had \n     frustrated their efforts to obtain a FISA warrant by raising\n\n[[Page S2742]]\n\n     unnecessary objections to the information submitted by \n     Minneapolis, modifying and removing that information, and \n     limiting the efforts by the Minneapolis Field Office to \n     contact other agencies for relevant information to bolster \n     the probable cause for the warrant. These concerns echoed \n     criticisms that this Committee has heard in other contexts \n     about the culture of FBI management and the effect of the \n     bureaucracy in stifling initiative by FBI agents in the \n     field.\n       In making this point, SA Rowley provided specific examples \n     of the frustrating delays and roadblocks erected by \n     Headquarters agents in the Moussaoui investigation:\n       ``For example at one point, the Supervisory Special Agent \n     at FBIHQ posited that the French information could be \n     worthless because it only identified Zacharias Moussaoui by \n     name and he, the SSA, didn't know how many people by that \n     name existed in France. A Minneapolis agent attempted to \n     surmount that problem by quickly phoning the FBI's Legal \n     Attache (Legat) in Paris, France, so that a check could be \n     made of the French telephone directories. Although the Legat \n     in France did not have access to all of the French telephone \n     directories, he was able to quickly ascertain that there was \n     only one listed in the Paris directory. It is not known if \n     this sufficiently answered the question, for the SSA \n     continued to find new reasons to stall.\n       ``Eventually, on August 28, 2001, after a series of e-mails \n     between Minneapolis and FBIHQ, which suggest that the FBIHQ \n     SSA deliberately further undercut the FISA effort by not \n     adding the further intelligence information which he had \n     promised to add that supported Moussaoui's foreign power \n     connection and making several changes in the wording of the \n     information that had been provided by the Minneapolis agent, \n     the Minneapolis agents were notified that the NSLU Unit Chief \n     did not think there was sufficient evidence of Moussaoui's \n     connection to a foreign power. Minneapolis personnel are, to \n     this date, unaware of the specifics of the verbal \n     presentations by the FBIHQ SSA to NSLU or whether anyone in \n     NSLU ever was afforded the opportunity to actually read for \n     him/herself all of the information on Moussaoui that had been \n     gathered by the Minneapolis Division and [redacted; \n     classified]. Obviously[,] verbal presentations are far \n     more susceptible to mis-characterization and error.''\n       Even after the attacks had commenced, FBI Headquarters \n     discouraged Minneapolis from securing a criminal search \n     warrant to examine Moussaoui's belongings, dismissing the \n     coordinated attack on the World Trade Center and Pentagon as \n     a coincidence.\n       Second, SA Rowley's letter highlighted the issue of the \n     apparent lack of understanding of the applicable legal \n     standards for establishing ``probable cause'' and the \n     requisite statutory FISA requirements by FBI personnel in the \n     Minneapolis Division and at FBI Headquarters. This issue will \n     be discussed in more detail below.\n\n                      C. Results of Investigation\n\n          1. The Mishandling of the Moussaoui FISA Application\n\n       Apart from SA Rowley's letter and her public testimony, the \n     Judiciary Committee and its staff found additional \n     corroboration that many of her concerns about the handling of \n     the Moussaoui FISA application for a search warrant were \n     justified.\n       At the outset, it is helpful to review how Headquarters \n     ``adds value'' to field offices in national security \n     investigations using FISA surveillance tools. Headquarters \n     has three functions in such investigations. The first \n     function is the ministerial function of actually assembling \n     the FISA application in the proper format for review by the \n     DOJ's Office of Intelligence Policy and Review OIPR and the \n     FISA Court. The other two functions are more substantive and \n     add ``value'' to the FISA application. The first substantive \n     function is to assist the field by being experts on the legal \n     aspects of FISA, and to provide guidance to the field as to \n     the information needed to meet the statutory requirements of \n     FISA. The second function is to supplement the information \n     from the field in order to establish or strengthen the \n     showing that there is ``probable cause'' that the FISA target \n     was an ``agent of a foreign power,'' by integrating \n     additional relevant intelligence information both from within \n     the FBI and from other intelligence or law enforcement \n     organizations outside the FBI. It is with respect to the \n     latter, substantive functions that Headquarters fell short in \n     the Moussaoui FISA application and, as a consequence, never \n     got to the first, more ministerial, function.\n       Our investigation revealed that the following events \n     occurred in connection with this FISA application. We \n     discovered that the Supervisory Special Agent (SSA) involved \n     in reviewing the Moussaoui FISA request was assigned to the \n     Radical Fundamentalist Unit (RFU) of the International \n     Terrorism Operations Section of the FBI's Counterterrorism \n     Division. The Unit Chief of the RFU was the SSA's immediate \n     supervisor. When the Minneapolis Division submitted its \n     application for the FISA search warrant for Moussaoui's \n     laptop computer and other property, the SSA was assigned the \n     responsibility of processing the application for approval. \n     Minneapolis submitted its application for the FISA warrant in \n     the form of a 26-page Electronic Communication (EC), which \n     contained all of the information that the Minneapolis agents \n     had collected to establish that Moussaoui was an agent of a \n     foreign power at the time. The SSA's responsibilities \n     included integrating this information submitted by the \n     Minneapolis division with information from other sources that \n     the Minneapolis agents were not privy to, in order to \n     establish there was probable cause that Moussaoui was an \n     agent of a foreign power. In performing this fairly \n     straightforward task, FBI Headquarters personnel failed \n     miserably in at least two ways.\n       First, most surprisingly, the SSA never presented the \n     information submitted by Minneapolis and from other sources \n     in its written, original format to any of the FBI's attorneys \n     in the National Security Law Unit (NSLU). The Minneapolis \n     agents had submitted their information in the 26-page EC and \n     a subsequent letterhead memorandum (LHM), but neither was \n     shown to the attorneys. Instead, the SSA relied on short, \n     verbal briefings to the attorneys, who opined that based on \n     the information provided verbally by the SSA they could not \n     establish that there was probable cause that Moussaoui was an \n     agent of a foreign power. Each of the attorneys in the NSLU \n     stated they did not receive documents on the Moussaoui FISA, \n     but instead only received a short, verbal briefing from the \n     SSA. As SA Rowley noted, however, ``verbal presentations are \n     far more susceptible to mis-characterization and error.''\n       The failure of the SSA to provide the 26-page Minneapolis \n     EC and the LHM to the attorneys, and the failure of the \n     attorneys to review those documents, meant that the \n     consideration by Headquarters officials of the evidence \n     developed by the Minneapolis agents was truncated. The \n     Committee has requested, but not yet received, the full 26-\n     page Minneapolis EC (even, inexplicably, in a classified \n     setting).\n       Second, the SSA's task was to help bolster the work of the \n     Minneapolis agents and collect information that would \n     establish probable cause that a ``foreign power'' existed, \n     and that Moussaoui was its ``agent.'' Indeed, sitting in the \n     FBI computer system was the Phoenix memorandum, which senior \n     FBI officials have conceded would have provided sufficient \n     additional context to Moussaoui's conduct to have established \n     probable cause. (Joint Inquiry Hearing, Testimony of Eleanor \n     Hill, Staff Director, September 24, 2002, p. 19: ``The [FBI] \n     attorneys also told the Staff that, if they had been aware of \n     the Phoenix memo, they would have forwarded the FISA request \n     to the Justice Department's Office of Intelligence Policy \n     Review (OIPR). They reasoned that the particulars of the \n     Phoenix memo changed the context of the Moussaoui \n     investigation and made a stronger case for the FISA warrant. \n     None of them saw the Phoenix memo before September 11.'') \n     Yet, neither the SSA nor anyone else at Headquarters \n     consulted about the Moussaoui application ever conducted any \n     computer searches for electronic or other information \n     relevant to the application. Even the much touted ``Woods \n     Procedures'' governing the procedures to be followed by FBI \n     personnel in preparing FISA applications do not require \n     Headquarters personnel to conduct even the most basic subject \n     matter computer searches or checks as part of the preparation \n     and review of FISA applications.\n\n                          2. General Findings.\n\n       We found that key FBI personnel involved in the FISA \n     process were not properly trained to carry out their \n     important duties. In addition, we found that the structural, \n     management, and resource problems plaguing the FBI in general \n     contributed to the intelligence failures prior to the 9/11 \n     attacks. (The Joint Inquiry by the Senate and House Select \n     Committee on Intelligence similarly concluded that the FBI \n     needs to ``establish and sustain independent career tracks \n     within the FBI that recognize and provide incentives for \n     demonstrated skills and performance of counterterrorism \n     agents and analysts; . . . implement training for agents in \n     the effective use of analysts and analysis in their \n     work;?improve national security law training of FBI \n     personnel;?and finally solve the FBI's persistent and \n     incapacitating information technology problems.'' (Final \n     Report, Recommendations, p. 6).) Following are some of the \n     most salient facts supporting these conclusions.\n       First, key FBI personnel responsible for protecting our \n     country against terrorism did not understand the law. The SSA \n     at FBI Headquarters responsible for assembling the facts in \n     support of the Moussaoui FISA application testified before \n     the Committee in a closed hearing that he did not know that \n     ``probable cause'' was the applicable legal standard for \n     obtaining a FISA warrant. In addition, he did not have a \n     clear understanding of what the probable cause standard \n     meant. The SSA was not a lawyer, and he was relying on FBI \n     lawyers for their expertise on what constituted probable \n     cause. In addition to not understanding the probable cause \n     standard, the SSA's supervisor (the Unit Chief) \n     responsible for reviewing FISA applications did not have a \n     proper understanding of the legal definition of the \n     ``agent of a foreign power'' requirement. Specifically, he \n     was under the incorrect impression that the statute \n     required a link to an already identified or ``recognized'' \n     terrorist organization, an interpretation that the FBI and \n     the supervisor himself admitted was incorrect. Thus, key \n     FBI officials did not have a proper understanding of \n     either the relevant burden of proof (probable cause) or \n     the substantive element of proof (agent of a foreign \n     power). This fundamental breakdown in training on an \n     important intelligence matter is of serious concern to \n     this Committee.\n\n[[Page S2743]]\n\n       Second, the complaints contained in the Rowley letter about \n     problems in the working relationship between field offices \n     and FBI Headquarters are more widespread. There must be a \n     dynamic relationship between Headquarters and field offices \n     with Headquarters providing direction to the efforts of \n     agents in the field when required. At the same time, \n     Headquarters personnel should serve to support field agents, \n     not to stifle initiative by field agents and hinder the \n     progress of significant cases. The FBI's Minneapolis office \n     was not alone in this complaint. Our oversight also confirmed \n     that agents from the FBI's Phoenix office, whose \n     investigation and initiative resulted in the so-called \n     ``Phoenix Memorandum,'' warning about suspicious activity in \n     U.S. aviation schools, also found their initiative dampened \n     by a non-responsive FBI Headquarters.\n       So deficient was the FISA process that, according to at \n     least one FBI supervisor, not only were new applications not \n     acted upon in a timely manner, but the surveillance of \n     existing targets of interest was often terminated, not \n     because the facts no longer warranted surveillance, but \n     because the application for extending FISA surveillance could \n     not be completed in a timely manner. Thus, targets that \n     represented a sufficient threat to national security that the \n     Department had sought, and a FISA Court judge had approved, a \n     FISA warrant were allowed to break free of surveillance for \n     no reason other than the FBI and DOJ's failure to complete \n     and submit the proper paper work. This failure is \n     inexcusable.\n       Third, systemic management problems at FBI Headquarters led \n     to a lack of accountability among senior FBI officials. A \n     revolving door at FBI Headquarters resulted in agents who \n     held key supervisory positions not having the required \n     specialized knowledge to perform their jobs competently. A \n     lack of proper communication produced a system where no \n     single person was held accountable for mistakes. Therefore, \n     there was little or no incentive to improve performance. \n     Fourth, the layers of FBI and DOJ bureaucracy also helped \n     lead to breakdowns in communication and serious errors in the \n     materials presented to the FISA Court. The Committee learned \n     that in the year before the Moussaoui case, one FBI \n     supervisor was barred from appearing before the FISC due to \n     inaccurate information presented in sworn affidavits to the \n     Court. DOJ explained in a December 23, 2002, response to \n     written questions from the July 25, 2002, oversight hearing \n     that:\n       ``One FBI supervisory special agent has been barred from \n     appearing before the Court. In March of 2001, the government \n     informed the Court of an error contained in a series of FISA \n     applications. This error arose in the description of a \n     ``wall'' procedure. The Presiding Judge of the Court at the \n     time, Royce Lamberth, wrote to the Attorney General \n     expressing concern over this error and barred one \n     specifically-named FBI agent from appearing before the Court \n     as a FISA affiant. . . . FBI Director Freeh personally met \n     twice with then-Presiding Judge Lamberth to discuss the \n     accuracy problems and necessary solutions.''\n       As the Committee later learned from review of the FISA \n     Court's May 17, 2002, opinion, that Court had complained of \n     75 inaccuracies in FISA affidavits submitted by the FBI, and \n     the DOJ and FBI had to develop new procedures to ensure \n     accuracy in presentations to that Court. These so-called \n     ``Woods Procedures'' were declassified at the request of the \n     authors and were made publicly available at the Committee's \n     hearing on June 6, 2002. As DOJ further explained in its \n     December 23, 2002, answers to written questions submitted on \n     July 25, 2002:\n       ``On April 6, 2001, the FBI disseminated to all field \n     divisions and relevant Headquarters divisions a set of new \n     mandatory procedures to be applied to all FISAs within the \n     FBI. These procedures known as the ``Woods procedures,'' are \n     designed to help minimize errors in and ensure that the \n     information provided to the Court is accurate. . .  They have \n     been declassified at the request of your Committee.''\n       DOJ describes the inaccuracies cited in the FISA Court \n     opinion as related to ``errors in the `wall' procedure'' to \n     keep separate information used for criminal prosecution and \n     information collected under FISA and used for foreign \n     intelligence. However, this does not appear to be the only \n     problem the FBI and DOJ were having in the use of FISA.\n       An FBI document obtained under the Freedom of Information \n     Act, which is attached to this report as Exhibit D, suggests \n     that the errors committed were far broader. The document is a \n     memorandum dated April 21, 2000, from the FBI's \n     Counterterrorism Division, that details a series of \n     inaccuracies and errors in handling FISA applications and \n     wiretaps that have nothing whatsoever to do with the \n     ``wall.'' Such mistakes included videotaping a meeting when \n     videotaping was not allowed under the relevant FISA Court \n     order, continuing to intercept a person's email after there \n     was no authorization to do so, and continuing a wiretap on a \n     cell phone even after the phone number had changed to a new \n     subscriber who spoke a different language from the target.\n       This document highlights the fact apart from the problems \n     with applications made to the FISC, that the FBI was \n     experiencing more systemic problems related to the \n     implementation of FISA orders. These issues were unrelated to \n     the legal questions surrounding the ``wall,'' which was in \n     effect long before 1999. The document notes that the number \n     of inaccuracies grew by three-and-one-half times from 1999 to \n     2000. We recommend that additional efforts to correct the \n     procedural, structural, and training problems in the FISA \n     process would go further toward ensuring accuracy in the FISA \n     process than simply criticizing the state of the law.\n       One legitimate question is whether the problems inside the \n     FBI and between the FBI and the FISA Court either caused FBI \n     Headquarters to be unduly cautious in proposing FISA warrants \n     or eroded the FISA Court's confidence in the DOJ and the FBI \n     to the point that it affected the FBI's ability to conduct \n     terrorism and intelligence investigations effectively. SA \n     Rowley opines in her letter that in the year before ``the \n     September 11th acts of terrorism, numerous alleged IOB \n     [Intelligence Oversight Board] violations on the part of FBI \n     personnel had to be submitted to the FBI's Office of \n     Professional Responsibility (OPR) as well as the IOB. I \n     believe the chilling effect upon all levels of FBI agents \n     assigned to intelligence matters and their managers hampered \n     us from aggressive investigation of terrorists.'' (Rowley \n     letter, pp. 7-8, fn. 7). Although the belated release of the \n     FISA Court's opinion of May 17, 2002, provided additional \n     insight into this issue, further inquiry is needed.\n       Fifth, the FBI's inability to properly analyze and \n     disseminate information (even from and between its own \n     agents) rendered key information that it collected relatively \n     useless. Had the FBI put together the disparate strands of \n     information that agents from around the country had furnished \n     to Headquarters before September 11, 2001, additional steps \n     could certainly have been taken to prevent the 9/11 attacks. \n     So, while no one can say with certainty that the 9/11 attacks \n     could have been prevented, in our view, it is also beyond \n     reasonable dispute that more could have been done in the \n     weeks before the attacks to try to prevent them.\n       Certain of our findings merit additional discussion, and \n     such discussion follows.\n\n  3. FBI's Misunderstanding of Legal Standards Applicable to the FISA\n\n      a. The FISA Statutory Standard: ``Agent of a Foreign Power''\n\n       In order to obtain either a search warrant or an \n     authorization to conduct electronic surveillance pursuant to \n     FISA, the FBI and Justice Department must establish before \n     the FISA Court probable cause that the targeted person is an \n     ``agent of a foreign power.'' An agent of a foreign power is \n     defined as ``any person who . . . knowingly aids or abets any \n     person in the conduct of [certain] activities.'' Those \n     certain activities include ``international terrorism,'' and \n     one definition of ``foreign power'' includes groups that \n     engage in international terrorism. Accordingly, in the \n     Moussaoui case, to obtain a FISA warrant the FBI had to \n     collect only enough evidence to establish that there was \n     ``probable cause'' to believe that Moussaoui was the \n     ``agent'' of an ``international terrorist group'' as defined \n     by FISA.\n       However, even the FBI agents who dealt most with FISA did \n     not correctly understand this requirement. During a briefing \n     with Judiciary Committee staff in February 2002, the \n     Headquarters counterterrorism Unit Chief of the unit \n     responsible for handling the Moussaoui FISA application \n     stated that with respect to international terrorism cases, \n     FISA warrants could only be obtained for ``recognized'' \n     terrorist groups (presumably those identified by the \n     Department of State or by the FBI itself or some other \n     government agency). The Unit Chief later admitted that he \n     knew that this was an incorrect understanding of the law, but \n     it was his understanding at the time the application was \n     pending. Additionally, during a closed hearing on July 9, \n     2002, the Supervisory Special Agent (``SSA'') who actually \n     handled the Moussaoui FISA application at Headquarters also \n     mentioned that he was trying to establish whether Moussaoui \n     was an ``agent of a recognized foreign power''.\n       Nowhere, however, does the statutory definition require \n     that the terrorist group be an identified organization that \n     is already recognized (such as by the United States \n     Department of State) as engaging in terrorist activities. \n     Indeed, even the FBI concedes this point. Thus, there was no \n     support whatsoever for key FBI officials' incorrect \n     understanding that the target of FISA surveillance must be \n     linked to such an identified group in the time before 9/\n     11. This misunderstanding colored the handling of requests \n     from the field to conduct FISA surveillance in the crucial \n     weeks before the 9/11 attacks. Instead of supporting such \n     an application, key Headquarters personnel asked the field \n     agents working on this investigation to develop additional \n     evidence to prove a fact that was unnecessary to gain \n     judicial approval under FISA. It is difficult to \n     understand how the agents whose job included such a heavy \n     FISA component could not have understood that statute. It \n     is difficult to understand how the FBI could have so \n     failed its own agents in such a crucial aspect of their \n     training.\n       The Headquarters personnel misapplied the FISA \n     requirements. In the context of this case, the foreign power \n     would be an international terrorist group, that is, ``a group \n     engaged in international terrorism or activities in \n     preparation therefore.'' A ``group'' is not defined in the \n     FISA, but in common parlance, and using other legal \n     principles, including criminal conspiracy, a group consists \n     of two or more persons whether identified or not. It is our \n     opinion that such a ``group''\n\n[[Page S2744]]\n\n     may exist, even if not a group ``recognized'' by the \n     Department of State.\n       The SSA's other task would be to help marshal evidence \n     showing probable cause that Moussaoui was an agent of that \n     group. In applying the ``totality of the circumstances,'' as \n     defined in the case of Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213 \n     (1983), any information available about Moussaoui's ``actual \n     contacts'' with the group should have been considered in \n     light of other information the FBI had in order to understand \n     and establish the true probable nature of those contacts. \n     (The Supreme Court's leading case on probable cause; it is \n     discussed in more detail in the next section of this report.) \n     It is only with consideration of all the information known to \n     the FBI that Moussaoui's contacts with any group could be \n     properly characterized in determining whether he was an agent \n     of such a group.\n       In making this evaluation, the fact, as recited in the \n     public indictment, that Moussaoui ``paid $6,800 in cash'' to \n     the Minneapolis flight school, without adequate explanation \n     for the source of this funding, would have been a highly \n     probative fact bearing on his connections to foreign groups. \n     Yet, it does not appear that this was a fact that the FBI \n     Headquarters agents considered in analyzing the totality of \n     the circumstances. The probable source of that cash should \n     have been a factor that was considered in analyzing the \n     totality of the circumstances. So too would the information \n     in the Phoenix memorandum have been helpful. It also was not \n     considered, as discussed further below. In our view, the FBI \n     applied too cramped an interpretation of probable cause and \n     ``agent of a foreign power'' in making the determination of \n     whether Moussaoui was an agent of a foreign power. FBI \n     Headquarters personnel in charge of reviewing this \n     application focused too much on establishing a nexus between \n     Moussaoui and a ``recognized'' group, which is not legally \n     required. Without going into the actual evidence in the \n     Moussaoui case, there appears to have been sufficient \n     evidence in the possession of the FBI which satisfied the \n     FISA requirements for the Moussaoui application. Given this \n     conclusion, our primary task is not to assess blame on \n     particular agents, the overwhelming majority of whom are to \n     be commended for devoting their lives to protecting the \n     public, but to discuss the systemic problems at the FBI that \n     contributed to their inability to succeed in that endeavor.\n\n                     b. The Probable Cause Standard\n\n       i. Supreme Court's Definition of ``Probable Cause''.--\n     During the course of our investigation, the evidence we have \n     evaluated thus far indicates that both FBI agents and FBI \n     attorneys do not have a clear understanding of the legal \n     standard for probable cause, as defined by the Supreme Court \n     in the case of Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213 (1983). This \n     is such a basic legal principle that, again, it is impossible \n     to justify the FBI's lack of complete and proper training on \n     it. In Gates, then-Associate Justice Rehnquist wrote for the \n     Court:\n       ``Standards such as proof beyond a reasonable doubt or by a \n     preponderance of the evidence, useful in formal trials, have \n     no place in the magistrate's decision. While an effort to fix \n     some general, numerically precise degree of certainty \n     corresponding to ``probable cause'' may not be helpful, it is \n     clear that ``only the probability, and not a prima facie \n     showing, of criminal activity is the standard of probable \n     cause.'' (462 U.S. at 236 (citations omitted.)\n       The Court further stated:\n       For all these reasons, we conclude that it is wiser to \n     abandon the ``twopronged test'' established by our decisions \n     in Aguilar and Spinelli. In its place we reaffirm the \n     totality of the circumstances analysis that traditionally has \n     informed probable cause determinations. The task of the \n     issuing magistrate is simply to make a practical, common-\n     sense decision whether, given all the circumstances set \n     forth in the affidavit before him, including the \n     ``veracity'' and ``basis of knowledge'' of persons \n     supplying hearsay information, there is a fair probability \n     that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a \n     particular place. And the duty of a reviewing court is \n     simply to ensure that the magistrate had a ``substantial \n     basis for . . . conclud[ing]'' that probable cause \n     existed. We are convinced that this flexible, easily \n     applied standard will better achieve the accommodation of \n     public and private interests that the Fourth Amendment \n     requires than does the approach that has developed from \n     Aguilar and Spinelli.''\n     Accordingly, it is clear that the Court rejected \n     ``preponderance of the evidence'' as the standard for \n     probable cause and established a standard of ``probability'' \n     based on the ``totality of the circumstances.''\n       ii. The FBI's Unnecessarily High Standard for Probable \n     Cause.--Unfortunately, our review has revealed that many \n     agents and lawyers at the FBI did not properly understand the \n     definition of probable cause and that they also possessed \n     inconsistent understandings of that term. In the portion of \n     her letter to Director Mueller discussing the quantum of \n     evidence needed to reach the standard of probable cause, SA \n     Rowley wrote that ``although I thought probable cause existed \n     (`probable cause' meaning that the proposition has to be more \n     likely than not, or if quantified, a 51% likelihood), I \n     thought our United States Attorney's Office, (for a lot of \n     reasons including just to play it safe), in regularly \n     requiring much more than probable cause before approving \n     affidavits, (maybe, if quantified, 75%-80% probability and \n     sometimes even higher), and depending upon the actual AUSA \n     who would be assigned, might turn us down.'' The Gates case \n     and its progeny do not require an exacting standard of proof. \n     Probable cause does not mean more likely than not, but only a \n     probability or substantial chance of the prohibited conduct \n     taking place. Moreover, ``[t]he fact that an innocent \n     explanation may be consistent with the facts alleged . . . \n     does not negate probable cause.''\n       On June 6, 2002, the Judiciary Committee held an open \n     hearing on the FBI's conduct of counterterrorism \n     investigations. The Committee heard from Director Mueller and \n     DOJ Inspector General Glenn Fine on the first panel and from \n     SA Rowley on the second panel. The issue of the probable \n     cause standard was specifically raised with Director Mueller, \n     citing the case of Illinois v. Gates, and Director Mueller \n     was asked to comment in writing on the proper standard was \n     asked for establishing probable cause. The FBI responded in \n     an undated letter to Senator Specter and with the subsequent \n     transmission of an electronic communication (E.C.) dated \n     September 16, 2002. In the E.C., the FBI's General Counsel \n     reviewed the case law defining ``probable cause,'' in order \n     to clarify the definition of probable cause for FBI personnel \n     handling both criminal investigations and FISA applications.\n       At the June 6th hearing, SA Rowley reviewed her discussion \n     of the probable cause standard in her letter. During that \n     testimony three issues arose. First, by focusing on the \n     prosecution of a potential case, versus investigating a case, \n     law enforcement personnel, both investigators and \n     prosecutors, may impose on themselves a higher standard than \n     necessary to secure a warrant. This prosecution focus is one \n     of the largest hurdles that the FBI is facing as it tries to \n     change its focus from crime fighting to the prevention of \n     terrorist attacks. It is symptomatic of a challenge facing \n     the FBI and DOJ in nearly every aspect of their new mission \n     in preventing terrorism. Secondly, prosecutors, in gauging \n     what amount of evidence reaches the probable cause standard, \n     may calibrate their decision to meet the de facto standard \n     imposed by the judges, who may be imposing a higher standard \n     than is required by law. Finally, SA Rowley opined that some \n     prosecutors and senior FBI officials may set a higher \n     standard due to risk-averseness, which is caused by \n     ``careerism.''\n       SA Rowley's testimony was corroborated in our other \n     hearings. During a closed hearing, in response to the \n     following questions, a key Headquarters SSA assigned to \n     terrorism matters stated that he did not know the legal \n     standard for obtaining a warrant under FISA.\n       ``Sen. Specter: . . . [SSA], what is your understanding of \n     the legal standard for a FISA warrant?\n       [SSA]: I am not an attorney, so I would turn all of those \n     types of questions over to one of the attorneys that I work \n     with in the National Security Law Unit.\n       Question: Well, did you make the preliminary determination \n     that there was not sufficient facts to get a FISA warrant \n     issued?\n       [SSA]: That is the way I saw it.\n       Question: Well, assuming you would have to prove there was \n     an agent and there was a foreign power, do you have to prove \n     it beyond a reasonable doubt? Do you have to have a \n     suspicion? Where in between?\n       [SSA]: I would ask my attorney in the National Security Law \n     Unit that question.\n       Question: Did anybody give you any instruction as to what \n     the legal standard for probable cause was?\n       [SSA]: In this particular instance, no.''\n       The SSA explained that he had instruction on probable cause \n     in the past, but could not recall that training. It became \n     clear to us that the SSA was collecting information without \n     knowing when he had enough and, more importantly, making \n     ``preliminary'' decisions and directing field agents to take \n     investigating steps without knowing the applicable legal \n     standards. While we agree that FBI agents and supervisory \n     personnel should consult regularly with legal experts at the \n     National Security Law Unit, and with the DOJ and U.S. \n     Attorneys Offices, supervisory agents must also have \n     sufficient facility for evaluating probable cause in order to \n     provide support and guidance to the field.\n       Unfortunately, our oversight revealed a similar confusion \n     as to the proper standard among other FBI officials. On July \n     9, 2002, the Committee held a closed session on this issue, \n     and heard from the following FBI personnel: Special Agent \n     ``G,'' who had been a counterterrorism supervisor in the \n     Minneapolis Division of the FBI and worked with SA Rowley; \n     the Supervisory Special Agent (``the SSA'') from FBI \n     Headquarters referred to in SA Rowley's letter (and referred \n     to the discussion above); the SSA's Unit Chief (``the Unit \n     Chief''); a very senior attorney from the FBI's Office of \n     General Counsel with national security responsibilities \n     (``Attorney #1''); and three attorneys assigned to the FBI's \n     Office of General Counsel's National Security Law Unit \n     (``Attorney #2,'' ``Attorney #3,'' and ``Attorney #4''). The \n     purpose of the session was to determine how the Moussaoui \n     FISA application had been processed by FBI Headquarters \n     personnel. None of the personnel present, including the \n     attorneys, appeared to be familiar with the standard for \n     probable cause articulated in Illinois v. Gates, and none had \n     reviewed the case prior to the hearing, despite its \n     importance having been highlighted at the June 6th hearing \n     with the FBI Director. To wit:\n\n[[Page S2745]]\n\n       Sen. Specter: . . .  [Attorney #1] what is the legal \n     standard for probable cause for a warrant?\n       [Attorney #1]: A reasonable belief that the facts you are \n     trying to prove are accurate.\n       Question: Reason to believe?\n       [Attorney #1]: Reasonable belief.\n       Question: Reasonable belief?\n       [Attorney #1]: More probable than not.\n       Question: More probable than not?\n       [Attorney #1]: Yes, sir. Not a preponderance of the \n     evidence.\n       Question: Are you familiar with ``Gates v. Illinois''?\n       [Attorney #1]: No, sir.\n       However, ``more probable than not'' is not the standard; \n     rather, ``only the probability, and not a prima facie \n     showing, of criminal activity is the standard of probable \n     cause.'' (Gates, 462 U.S. at 36 (citations omitted). )\n       Similarly, Attorneys #2, #3, and #4 were also not familiar \n     with Gates. Under further questioning, Attorney #1 conceded \n     that the FBI, at that time, did not have written procedures \n     concerning the definition of ``probable cause'' in FISA \n     cases: ``On the FISA side of the house I don't think we have \n     any written guidelines on that.'' Additionally, Attorney #1 \n     stated that ``[w]e need to have some kinds of facts that an \n     agent can swear to a reasonable belief that they are true,'' \n     to establish that a person is an agent of a foreign power. \n     Giving a precise definition of probable cause is not an easy \n     task, as whether probable cause exists rests on factual and \n     practical considerations in a particular context. Yet, even \n     with the inherent difficulty in this standard we are \n     concerned that senior FBI officials offered definitions that \n     imposed heightened proof requirements. The issue of what is \n     required for ``probable cause'' is especially troubling \n     because it is not the first time that the issue had arisen \n     specifically in the FISA context. Indeed, the Judiciary \n     Committee confronted the issue of ``probable cause'' in the \n     FISA context in 1999, when the Committee initiated oversight \n     hearings of the espionage investigation of Dr. Wen Ho Lee. \n     Among the many issues examined was whether there was probable \n     cause to obtain FISA surveillance of Dr. Lee. In that case, \n     there was a disagreement as to whether probable cause existed \n     between the FBI and the DOJ, within the DOJ, and among \n     ourselves.\n       In 1999, Attorney General Janet Reno commissioned an \n     internal DOJ review of the Wen Ho Lee investigation. The \n     Attorney General's Review Team on the Handling of the Los \n     Alamos National Laboratory Investigation was headed by \n     Assistant United States Attorney Randy I. Bellows, a Senior \n     Litigation Counsel in the Office of the United States \n     Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. Mr. Bellows \n     submitted his exhaustive report on May 12, 2000 (the \n     ``Bellows Report''), and made numerous findings of fact and \n     recommendations. With respect to the issue of probable cause, \n     Mr. Bellows concluded that:\n       ``The final draft FISA application (Draft #3), on its face, \n     established probable cause to believe that Wen Ho Lee was an \n     agent of a foreign power, that is to say, a United States \n     person currently engaged in clandestine intelligence \n     gathering activities for or on behalf of the PRC which \n     activities involved or might involve violations of the \n     criminal laws of the United States . . . . Given what the FBI \n     and OIPR knew at the time, it should have resulted in the \n     submission of a FISA application, and the issuance of a FISA \n     order.''\n       The Bellows team concluded that OIPR had been too \n     conservative with the Wen Ho Lee FISA application, a \n     conservatism that may continue to affect the FBI's and DOJ's \n     handling of FISA applications. The team found that with \n     respect to OIPR's near-``perfect record'' before the FISA \n     Court (only one FISA rejection), ``[w]hile there is something \n     almost unseemly in the use of such a remarkable track record \n     as proof of error, rather than proof of excellence, it is \n     nevertheless true that this record suggests the use of `PC+,' \n     an insistence on a bit more than the law requires.''\n       The Bellows team made another finding of particular \n     pertinence to the instant issue. It found that ``[t]he \n     Attorney General should have been apprised of any rejection \n     of a FISA request . . . .'' In effect, FBI Headquarters \n     rejected the Minneapolis Division's request for a FISA \n     application, a decision that was not reported to then Acting \n     Director Thomas Pickard. Director Mueller has adopted a new \n     policy, not formally recorded in writing, that he be informed \n     of the denial within the FBI of any request for a FISA \n     application. However, in an informal briefing the weekend \n     after this new policy was publicly announced, the FBI lawyer \n     whom it most directly affected claimed to know nothing of the \n     new ``policy'' beyond what he had read in the newspaper. From \n     an oversight perspective, it is striking that the FBI and DOJ \n     were effectively on notice regarding precisely this issue: \n     that the probable cause test being applied in FISA \n     investigations was more stringent than legally required. We \n     appreciate the carefulness and diligence with which the \n     professionals at OIPR and the FBI exercise their duties in \n     processing FISA applications, which normally remain secret \n     and immune from the adversarial scrutiny to which criminal \n     warrants are subject. Yet, this persistent problem has two \n     serious repercussions. First, the FBI and DOJ appear to be \n     failing to take decisive action to provide in-depth training \n     to agents and lawyers on an issue of the utmost national \n     importance. We simply cannot continue to deny or ignore such \n     training flaws only to see them repeated in the future.\n       Second, when the DOJ and FBI do not apply or use the FISA \n     as fully or comprehensively as the law allows, pressure is \n     brought on the Congress to change the statute in ways that \n     may not be at all necessary. From a civil liberties \n     perspective, the high-profile investigations and cases in \n     which the FISA process appears to have broken down is too \n     easily blamed on the state of the law rather than on \n     inadequacies in the training of those responsible for \n     implementing the law. The reaction on the part of the DOJ and \n     FBI has been to call upon the Congress to relax FISA \n     standards rather than engage in the more time-consuming \n     remedial task of reforming the management and process to make \n     it work better. Many times such ``quick legislative fixes'' \n     are attractive on the surface, but only operate as an excuse \n     to avoid correcting more fundamental problems.\n\n 4. The Working Relationship Between FBI Headquarters and Field Offices\n\n       Our oversight revealed that on more than one occasion FBI \n     Headquarters was not sufficiently supportive of agents in the \n     field who were exercising their initiative in an attempt to \n     carry out the FBI's mission. While at least some of this is \n     due to resource and staffing shortages, which the current \n     Director is taking action to address, there are broader \n     issues involved as well. Included in these is a deep-rooted \n     culture at the FBI that makes an assignment to Headquarters \n     unattractive to aggressive field agents and results in an \n     attitude among many who do work at Headquarters that is not \n     supportive of the field.\n       In addition to these cultural problems at the FBI, we \n     conclude that there are also structural and management \n     problems that contribute to the FBI's shortcomings as \n     exemplified in the implementation of the FISA. Personnel are \n     transferred in and out of key Headquarters jobs too quickly, \n     so that they do not possess the expertise necessary to carry \n     out their vital functions. In addition, the multiple layers \n     of supervision at Headquarters have created a bureaucratic \n     FBI that either will not or cannot respond quickly enough to \n     time-sensitive initiatives from the field. We appreciate that \n     the FBI has taken steps to cut through some of this \n     bureaucracy by requiring OIPR attorneys to have direct \n     contact with field agents working on particular cases.\n       In addition to hampering the implementation of FISA, these \n     are problems that the Judiciary Committee has witnessed \n     replayed in other contexts within the FBI. These root causes \n     must be addressed head on, so that Headquarters personnel at \n     the FBI view their jobs as supporting talented and aggressive \n     field agents.\n       The FBI has a key role in the FISA process. Under the \n     system designed by the FBI, a field agent and his field \n     supervisors must negotiate a series of bureaucratic levels in \n     order to even ask for a FISA warrant. The initial \n     consideration of a FISA application and evaluation of whether \n     statutory requirements are met is made by Supervisory Special \n     Agents who staff the numerous Headquarters investigative \n     units. These positions are critical and sensitive by their \n     very nature. No application can move forward to the attorneys \n     in the FBI's National Security Law Unit (NSLU) for further \n     consideration unless the unit SSA says so. In addition, no \n     matter may be forwarded to the DOJ lawyers at the OIPR \n     without the approval of the NSLU. These multiple layers of \n     review are necessary and prudent but take time.\n       The purpose of having SSAs in the various counterterrorism \n     units is so that those personnel may bring their experience \n     and skill to bear to bolster and enhance the substance of \n     applications sent by field offices. A responsible SSA will \n     provide strategic guidance to the requesting field division \n     and coordinate the investigative activities and efforts \n     between FBI Headquarters and that office, in addition to the \n     other field divisions and outside agencies involved in the \n     investigation. This process did not work well in the \n     Moussaoui case.\n       Under the FBI's system, an effective SSA should thoroughly \n     brief the NSLU and solicit its determination on the adequacy \n     of any application within a reasonable time after receipt. In \n     ``close call'' investigations, we would expect the NSLU \n     attorneys to seek to review all written information forwarded \n     by the field office rather than rely on brief oral briefings. \n     In the case of the Moussaoui application forwarded from \n     Minneapolis, the RFU SSA merely provided brief, oral \n     briefings to NSLU attorneys and did not once provide that \n     office with a copy of the extensive written application for \n     their review. An SSA should also facilitate communication \n     between the OIPR, the NSLU, and those in the field doing the \n     investigation and constructing the application. That also did \n     not occur in this case.\n       By its very nature, having so many players involved in the \n     process allows internal FBI finger-pointing with little or no \n     accountability for mistakes. The NSLU can claim, as it does \n     here, to have acquiesced to the factual judgment of the SSAs \n     in the investigative unit. The SSAs, in turn, claim that they \n     have received no legal training or guidance and rely on the \n     lawyers at the NSLU to make what they term as legal \n     decisions. The judgment of the agents in the field, who are \n     closest to the facts of the case, is almost completely \n     disregarded.\n       Stuck in this confusing, bureaucratic maze, the seemingly \n     simple and routine business practices within key Headquarters \n     units\n\n[[Page S2746]]\n\n     were flawed. As we note above, even routine renewals on \n     already existing FISA warrants were delayed or not obtained \n     due to the lengthy delays in processing FISA applications.\n\n       5. The Mishandling of the Phoenix Electronic Communication\n\n       The handling of the Phoenix EC represents another prime \n     example of the problems with the FBI's FISA system as well as \n     its faulty use of information technology. The EC contained \n     information that was material to the decision whether or not \n     to seek a FISA warrant in the Moussaoui case, but it was \n     never considered by the proper people. Even though the RFU \n     Unit Chief himself was listed as a direct addressee on the \n     Phoenix EC (in addition to others within the RFU and other \n     counterterrorism Units at FBI Headquarters), he claims that \n     he never even knew of the existence of such an EC until the \n     FBI's Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) contacted \n     him months after the 9/11 attacks. Even after this \n     revelation, the Unit Chief never made any attempt to notify \n     the Phoenix Division (or any other field Division) that he \n     had not read the EC addressed to him. He issued no clarifying \n     instructions from his Unit to the field, which very naturally \n     must believe to this day that this Unit Chief is actually \n     reading and assessing the reports that are submitted to his \n     attention and for his consideration. The Unit Chief in \n     question here has claimed to be ``at a loss'' as to why he \n     did not receive a copy of the Phoenix EC at the time it was \n     assigned, as was the practice in the Unit at that time.\n       Apparently, it was routine in the Unit for analytic support \n     personnel to assess and close leads assigned to them without \n     any supervisory agent personnel reviewing their activities. \n     In the RFU, the two individuals in the support capacity \n     entered into service at the FBI in 1996 and 1998. The Phoenix \n     memo was assigned to one of these analysts as a ``lead'' by \n     the Unit's Investigative Assistant (IA) on or about July \n     30th, 2001. The IA would then accordingly give the Unit Chief \n     a copy of each EC assigned to personnel in the Unit for \n     investigation. The RFU Unit Chief claims to have never seen \n     this one. In short, the crucial information being collected \n     by FBI agents in the field was disappearing into a black hole \n     at Headquarters. To the extent the information was reviewed, \n     it was not reviewed by the appropriate people.\n       More disturbingly, this is a recurrent problem at the FBI. \n     The handling of the Minneapolis LHM and the Phoenix memo, \n     neither of which were reviewed by the correct people in the \n     FBI, are not the first times that the FBI has experienced \n     such a problem in a major case. The delayed production of \n     documents in the Oklahoma City bombing trial, for example, \n     resulted in significant embarrassment for the FBI in a case \n     of national importance. The Judiciary Committee held a \n     hearing during which the DOJ's own Inspector General \n     testified that the inability of the FBI to access its own \n     information base did and will have serious negative \n     consequences. Although the FBI is undertaking to update its \n     information technology to assist in addressing this problem, \n     the Oklahoma City case demonstrates that the issue is broader \n     than antiquated computer systems. As the report concluded, \n     ``human error, not the inadequate computer system, was the \n     chief cause of the failure. . . .'' The report concluded that \n     problems of training and FBI culture were the primary causes \n     of the embarrassing mishaps in that case. Once again, the \n     FBI's and DOJ's failures to address such broad based problems \n     seem to have caused their recurrence in another context.\n\n         6. The FBI's Poor Information Technology Capabilities\n\n       On June 6, 2002, Director Mueller and SA Rowley testified \n     before the Senate Judiciary Committee on the search \n     capabilities of the FBI's Automated Case Support (ACS) \n     system. ACS is the FBI's centralized case management system, \n     and serves as the central electronic repository for the FBI's \n     official investigative textual documents. Director Mueller, \n     who was presumably briefed by senior FBI officials regarding \n     the abilities of the FBI's computers, testified that, \n     although the Phoenix memorandum had been uploaded to the ACS, \n     it was not used by agents who were investigating the \n     Moussaoui case in Minnesota or at Headquarters. According to \n     Director Mueller, the Phoenix memorandum was not accessible \n     to the Minneapolis field office or any other offices around \n     the country; it was only accessible to the places where it \n     had been sent: Headquarters and perhaps two other offices. \n     Director Mueller also testified that no one in the FBI had \n     searched the ACS for relevant terms such as ``aviation \n     schools'' or ``pilot training.'' According to Director \n     Mueller, he hoped to have in the future the technology in the \n     computer system to do that type of search (e.g., to pull out \n     any electronic communication relating to aviation), as it was \n     very cumbersome to do that type of search as of June 6, 2002. \n     SA Rowley testified that FBI personnel could only perform \n     one-word searches in the ACS system, which results in too \n     many results to review.\n       Within two weeks of the hearing, on June 14, 2002, both \n     Director Mueller (through John E. Collingwood, AD Office of \n     Public and Congressional Affairs) and SA Rowley submitted to \n     the Committee written corrections of their June 6, 2002, \n     testimony. The FBI corrected the record by stating that ACS \n     was implemented in all FBI field offices, resident agencies, \n     legal attache offices, and Headquarters on October 16, 1995. \n     In addition, it was, in fact, possible to search for multiple \n     terms in the ACS system, using Boolean connectors (e.g., \n     hijacker or terrorist and flight adj school), and to refine \n     searches with other fields (e.g., document type). Rowley \n     confirmed the multiple search-term capabilities of ACS and \n     added that the specifics of ACS's search capabilities are not \n     widely known within the FBI.\n       We commend Director Mueller and SA Rowley for promptly \n     correcting their testimony as they became aware of the \n     incorrect description of the FBI's ACS system during the \n     hearing. Nevertheless, their corrections and statements \n     regarding FBI personnel's lack of knowledge of the ACS system \n     highlights a longstanding problem within the Bureau. An OIG \n     report, issued in July 1999, states that FBI personnel were \n     not well-versed in the ACS system or other FBI databases. An \n     OIG report of March 2002, which analyzed the causes for the \n     belated production of many documents in the Oklahoma City \n     bombing case, also concluded that the inefficient and complex \n     ACS system was a contributing factor in the FBI's failure to \n     provide hundreds of investigative documents to the defendants \n     in the Oklahoma City Bombing Case. In short, this Committee's \n     oversight has confirmed, yet again, that not only are the \n     FBI's computer systems inadequate but that the FBI does not \n     adequately train its own personnel in how to use their \n     technology.\n\n             7. The ``Revolving Door'' at FBI Headquarters\n\n       Compounding information technology problems at the FBI are \n     both the inexperience and attitude of ``careerist'' senior \n     FBI agents who rapidly move through sensitive supervisory \n     positions at FBI Headquarters. This ``ticket punching'' is \n     routinely allowed to take place with the acquiescence of \n     senior FBI management at the expense of maintaining critical \n     institutional knowledge in key investigative and analytical \n     units. FBI agents occupying key Headquarters positions have \n     complained to members of the Senate Judiciary Committee that \n     relocating to Washington, DC, is akin to a ``hardship'' \n     transfer in the minds of many field agents. More often than \n     not, however, the move is a career enhancement, as the agent \n     is almost always promoted to a higher pay grade during or \n     upon the completion of the assignment. The tour at \n     Headquarters is usually relatively short in duration and the \n     agent is allowed to leave and return to the field.\n       To his credit, Director Mueller tasked the Executive Board \n     of the Special Agents Advisory Committee (SAAC) to report to \n     him on disincentives for Special Agents seeking \n     administrative advancement. They reported on July 1, 2002, \n     with the following results of an earlier survey:\n       ``Less than 5% of the Agents surveyed indicated an interest \n     in promotion if relocation to FBIHQ was required. Of 35 field \n     supervisors queried, 31 said they would `step down' rather \n     than accept an assignment in Washington, D.C. All groups of \n     Agents (those with and without FBIHQ experience) viewed as \n     assignment at FBIHQ as very negative. Only 6% of those who \n     had previously been assigned there believed that the \n     experience was positive--the work was clerical, void of \n     supervisory responsibility critical to future field or other \n     assignments. Additionally, the FBIHQ supervisors were \n     generally powerless to make decisions while working in an \n     environment which was full of negativity, intimidation, fear \n     and anxiousness to leave.''\n       The SAAC report also contained serious criticism of FBI \n     management, stating:\n       ``Agents across the board expressed reluctance to become \n     involved in a management system which they believe to [be] \n     hypocritical, lacking ethics, and one in which we lead by \n     what we say and not by example. Most subordinates believe and \n     most managers agreed that the FBI is too often concerned with \n     appearance over substance. Agents believed that management \n     decisions are often based on promoting one's self interest \n     versus the best interests of the FBI.''\n       There is a dire need for the FBI to reconsider and reform a \n     personnel system and a management structure that do not \n     create the proper incentives for its most capable and \n     talented agents to occupy its most important posts. The SAAC \n     recommended a number of steps to reduce or eliminate \n     ``disincentives for attaining leadership within the Bureau.'' \n     Congress must also step up to the plate and assess the \n     location pay differential for Headquarters transfers compared \n     to other transfers and other financial rewards for \n     administrative advancement to ensure that those agents with \n     relevant field experience and accomplishment are in critical \n     Headquarters positions.\n       Indeed, in the time period both before and after the \n     Moussaoui application was processed at Headquarters (and \n     continuing for months after the 9/11 attacks), most of the \n     agents in the pertinent Headquarters terrorism unit had less \n     than two years of experience working on such cases. In the \n     spring and summer of 2001, when Administration officials have \n     publicly acknowledged increased ``chatter'' internationally \n     about potential terrorist attacks, the Radical Fundamentalist \n     Unit at FBI Headquarters experienced the routinely high rate \n     of turnover in agent personnel as other units regularly did. \n     Not only was the Unit Chief replaced, but also one or more of \n     the four SSAs who reported to the Unit Chief was a recent \n     transfer into the Unit. These key personnel were to have \n     immediate and direct control over the fate of\n\n[[Page S2747]]\n\n     the ``Phoenix memo'' and the Minneapolis Division's \n     submission of a FISA application for the personal belongings \n     of Moussaoui. While these supervisory agents certainly had \n     distinguished and even outstanding professional experience \n     within the FBI before being assigned to Headquarters, their \n     short tours in the specialized counterterrorism units raises \n     questions about the depth and scope of their training and \n     experience to handle these requests properly and, more \n     importantly, about the FBI's decision to allow such a key \n     unit to be staffed in such a manner.\n       Rather than staffing counterterrorism units with \n     Supervisory Special Agents on a revolving door basis, these \n     positions should be filled with a cadre of senior agents who \n     can provide continuity in investigations and guidance to the \n     field.\n       A related deficiency in FBI management practices was that \n     those SSAs making the decisions on whether any FISA \n     application moved out of an operational unit were not given \n     adequate training, guidance, or instruction on the practical \n     application of key elements of the FISA statute. As we stated \n     earlier, it seems incomprehensible that those very \n     individuals responsible for taking a FISA application past \n     the first step were allowed to apply their own individual \n     interpretations of critical elements of the law relating to \n     what constitutes a ``foreign power,'' ``acting as an agent of \n     a foreign power,'' ``probable cause,'' and the meaning of \n     ``totality of the circumstances,'' before presenting an \n     application to the attorneys in the NSLU. We learned at the \n     Committee's hearing this past September 10th, a full year \n     after the terrorist attacks, that the FBI drafted \n     administrative guidelines that will provide for Unit Chiefs \n     and SSAs at Headquarters a uniform interpretation of how--and \n     just as importantly--when to apply probable cause or other \n     standards in FISA warrant applications.\n       All of these problems demonstrate that there is a dire need \n     for a thorough review of procedural and substantive practices \n     regarding FISA at the FBI and the DOJ. The Senate Judiciary \n     Committee needs to be even more vigilant in its oversight \n     responsibilities regarding the entire FISA process and the \n     FISA Court itself. The FISA process is not fatally flawed, \n     but rather its administration and coordination needs swift \n     review and improvement if it is to continue to be an \n     effective tool in America's war on terrorism.\n\n\n         IV. The Importance of Enhanced Congressional Oversight\n\n       An undeniable and distinguishing feature of the flawed FISA \n     implementation system that has developed at the DOJ and FBI \n     over the last 23 years is its secrecy. Both at the legal and \n     operational level, the most generalized aspects of the DOJ's \n     FISA activities have not only been kept secret from the \n     general public but from the Congress as well. As we stated \n     above, much of this secrecy has been due to a lack of \n     diligence on the part of Congress exercising its oversight \n     responsibility. Equally disturbing, however, is the \n     difficulty that a properly constituted Senate Committee, \n     including a bipartisan group of senior senators, had in \n     conducting effective oversight of the FISA process when we \n     did attempt to perform our constitutional duties.\n       The Judiciary Committee's ability to conduct its inquiry \n     was seriously hampered by the initial failure of the DOJ and \n     the Administrative Office of the United States Courts to \n     provide to the Committee an unclassified opinion of the FISA \n     Court relevant to these matters. As noted above, we only \n     received this opinion on August 22, 2002, in the middle of \n     the August recess.\n       Under current law there is no requirement that FISA Court \n     opinions be made available to Congressional committees or the \n     public. The only statutory FISA reporting requirement is for \n     an unclassified annual report of the Attorney General to the \n     Administrative Office of the United States Courts and to \n     Congress setting forth with respect to the preceding calendar \n     year (a) the total number of applications made for orders and \n     extensions of orders approving electronic surveillance under \n     Title I, and (b) the total number of such orders and \n     extensions either granted, modified, or denied. These reports \n     do not disclose or identify unclassified FISA Court opinions \n     or disclose the number of individuals or entities targeted \n     for surveillance, nor do they cover FISA Court orders for \n     physical searches, pen registers, or records access.\n       Current law also requires various reports from the Attorney \n     General to the Intelligence and Judiciary Committees that are \n     not made public. These reports are used for Congressional \n     oversight purposes, but do not include FISA Court opinions. \n     When the Act was passed in 1978, it required the Intelligence \n     Committees for the first five years after enactment to report \n     respectively to the House of Representatives and the Senate \n     concerning the implementation of the Act and whether the Act \n     should be amended, repealed, or permitted to continue in \n     effect without amendment. Those public reports were issued in \n     1979-1984 and discussed one FISA Court opinion issued in \n     1981, which related to the Court's authority to issue search \n     warrants without express statutory jurisdiction.\n       The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 made substantial amendments to \n     FISA, and those changes are subject to a sunset clause under \n     which they shall generally cease to have effect on December \n     31, 2005. That Act did not provide for any additional \n     reporting to the Congress or the public regarding \n     implementation of these amendments or FISA Court opinions \n     interpreting them.\n       Oversight of the entire FISA process is hampered not just \n     because the Committee was initially denied access to a single \n     unclassified opinion but because the Congress and the public \n     get no access to any work of the FISA Court, even work that \n     is unclassified. This secrecy is unnecessary, and allows \n     problems in applying the law to fester. There needs to be a \n     healthy dialogue on unclassified FISA issues within Congress \n     and the Executive branch and among informed professionals and \n     interested groups. Even classified legal memoranda submitted \n     by the DOJ to, and classified opinions by, the FISA Court can \n     reasonably be redacted to allow some scrutiny of the issues \n     that are being considered. This highly important body of FISA \n     law is being developed in secret, and, because they are ex \n     parte proceedings, without the benefit of opposing sides \n     fleshing out the arguments as in other judicial contexts, and \n     without even the scrutiny of the public or the Congress. \n     Resolution of this problem requires considering legislation \n     that would mandate that the Attorney General submit annual \n     public reports on the number of targets of FISA surveillance, \n     search, and investigative measures who are United States \n     persons, the number of criminal prosecutions where FISA \n     information is used and approved for use, and the \n     unclassified opinions and legal reasoning adopted by the FISA \n     Court and submitted by the DOJ.\n       As the recent litigation before the FISA Court of Review \n     demonstrated, oversight also bears directly on the protection \n     of important civil liberties. Due process means that the \n     justice system has to be fair and accountable when the system \n     breaks down.\n       Many things are different now since the tragic events of \n     last September, but one thing that has not changed is the \n     United States Constitution. Congress must work to guarantee \n     the civil liberties of our people while at the same time meet \n     our obligations to America's national security. Excessive \n     secrecy and unilateral decision making by a single branch of \n     government is not the proper method of striking that all \n     important balance. We hope that, joining together, the \n     Congress and the Executive Branch can work in a bipartisan \n     manner to best serve the American people on these important \n     issues. The stakes are too high for any other approach.\n     Patrick Leahy,\n       U.S. Senator. \n     Arlen Specter,\n       U.S. Senator.\n     Charles E. Grassley,\n       U.S. Senator.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask unanimous consent that the response of the \nDepartment of Justice dated February 20, 2003 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                            Department of Justice,\n\n\n                                Office of Legislative Affairs,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 20, 2003.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: This is to follow up on outstanding \n     questions from the Committee's hearings on June 6, 2002, at \n     which FBI Director Mueller testified, a closed hearing on \n     July 9, 2002, at which seven FBI personnel testified, and a \n     September 10, 2002, hearing at which an Associate Deputy \n     Attorney General testified on the FISA process. During this \n     latter hearing, and in follow-up letters, dated September 24, \n     2002 and October 1, 2002, Senator Specter asked for \n     additional information about the circumstances leading up to \n     the FBI's issuance of guidance on the probable cause standard \n     and the number of FBI requests for FISA warrants between June \n     6, 2002 and September 16, 2002.\n       In July 2002, the General Counsel's Office undertook to \n     draft a comprehensive memorandum to provide FBI field and \n     headquarters personnel with a practitioner's guide to the \n     FISA process and the changes resulting from the USA PATRIOT \n     Act. A section of that guidance was to be devoted to a \n     refresher discussion of the probable cause standard. Near the \n     end of that month, however, a new General Counsel reported to \n     the FBI and reviewed the initial draft. After discussions \n     with attorneys in the FBI's National Security Law Unit and \n     the Justice Department, it was determined that the guidance \n     would be issued in three separate memoranda. One would \n     provide a broad overview of the FISA process; one would cover \n     recent revisions to the limitations on the sharing of FISA-\n     derived information; and one would clarify the probable cause \n     standard.\n       These three memoranda were issued in September 2002 and \n     copies are enclosed for your convenience. The 15-page \n     overview of the FISA process was finalized and posted on the \n     FBI intranet on September 12, 2002. The 11-page guidance on \n     the new information sharing procedures was issued on \n     September 18, 2002, and later superceded by the November 18, \n     2002 decision of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court \n     of Review which approved the Attorney General's March 6, 2002 \n     Intelligence Sharing Procedures for Foreign Intelligence and \n     Foreign Counterintelligence Investigations Conducted by the \n     FBI. The clarification memorandum on the probable cause \n     standard was released on September 16, 2002 and I am advised \n     that, as a\n\n[[Page S2748]]\n\n     matter of courtesy, a copy was delivered to Senator Specter's \n     office on that date.\n       In light of the November 18, 2002, decision of the Foreign \n     Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review, the Department \n     issued ``field guidance'' on intelligence sharing and FISA \n     issues on December 24, 2002, which was sent to all United \n     States Attorneys, all Anti-Terrorism Task Force coordinators \n     and all Special Agents of the FBI. It consisted of three \n     documents: (1) a memorandum jointly issued by the Deputy \n     Attorney General and the Director of the FBI discussing the \n     intelligence sharing procedures for foreign intelligence and \n     foreign counterintelligence investigations, including a chart \n     summarizing the March 6, 2002 Intelligence Sharing \n     Procedures; (2) the Attorney General's March 6, 2002 \n     memorandum on Intelligence Sharing Procedures for Foreign \n     Intelligence and Counterintelligence Investigations conducted \n     by the FBI; and (3) a memorandum from the Deputy Attorney \n     General summarizing the November 18, 2002, decision of \n     Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review. An \n     electronic copy of the field guidance was provided to the \n     Judiciary Committee on January 17, 2003 (an additional \n     courtesy copy is enclosed).\n       Also on December 24, 2002, the Deputy Attorney General \n     issued a memorandum instructing the Counsel for Intelligence \n     Policy, the Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal \n     Division, and the Director of the FBI to ``jointly establish \n     and implement a training curriculum for all Department \n     lawyers and FBI agents who work on foreign intelligence or \n     counterintelligence investigations, both in Washington, DC \n     and in the field, including Assistant United States Attorneys \n     designated under the Department's March 6, 2002 Intelligence \n     Sharing Procedures. At a minimum, the training shall address \n     the FISA process, the importance of accuracy in FISA \n     applications, the legal standards (including probable cause) \n     set by FISA, coordination with law enforcement and with the \n     Intelligence Community, and the proper storing and handling \n     of classified information.'' A copy of the December 24, 2002, \n     training memorandum is enclosed.\n       Senator Specter's letter of October 1, 2002, asked as an \n     additional follow-up question about the number of FBI \n     requests for FISA warrants between Colleen Rowley's June 6, \n     2002, appearance before the Judiciary Committee and the \n     September 16, 2002, issuance of the probable cause \n     memorandum. The number of FBI applications to the Foreign \n     Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) for FISA searches and \n     surveillances during this time period is classified at the \n     SECRET level and is being delivered to the Committee through \n     the Office of Senate Security under separate cover and in \n     accordance with the longstanding Executive branch practices \n     on the sharing of classified intelligence information with \n     Congress. Please note that the total annual number of FISA \n     applications for orders authorizing electronic surveillance \n     filed by the government and the total annual number of such \n     applications either granted, modified, or denied by the FISC \n     are not classified and are provided annually to the \n     Administrative Office of the United States Court and to \n     Congress under section 1807 of FISA.\n       The question of what probable cause standard was used on \n     FISA applications for warrants during that time was posed to \n     supervisors in the National Security Law Unit and in the \n     Office of Intelligence Policy and Review. They responded that \n     the applications--and their discussions about those \n     applications--reflect that the agents and attorneys involved \n     in the FISA process understood and applied the correct \n     probable cause standard in their analyses of the relevant \n     evidence. Based on their observations, the staff's \n     understanding of probable cause--whether based on a reading \n     of Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213 (1983), or of any of the \n     other numerous authoritative judicial statements of the \n     probable cause standard--did not change with the issuance of \n     the probable cause memorandum. The standard they employed was \n     consistent with Illinois v. Gates both before and after they \n     received the memorandum.\n       I hope that this information is helpful. If you would like \n     further assistance on this or on any other matter, please do \n     not hesitate to contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Jamie E. Brown,\n                                Acting Assistant Attorney General.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. The oversight is going to continue on this matter. We \nare dealing with a constitutional responsibility of the Congress, that \nis the Senate and the Judiciary Committee, to conduct oversight on the \nDepartment of Justice and on the Federal Bureau of Investigation. This \ninquiry has demonstrated to this Senator that such oversight is sorely \nneeded.\n  When I was District Attorney of Philadelphia and an assistant \ndistrict attorney before that time, I had occasion to deal with a great \nmany applications for search warrants. To find now that the key FBI \npersonnel entrusted with the responsibility to apply for warrants under \nthe Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, to get information on agents \nof foreign powers, at a time when the United States is threatened by \nterrorism, and they do not know what the right standard is, is just \nscandalous.\n  It has already been detailed on the public record that had they \nfollowed the right standard, and had the FBI gotten the computer of \nZacarias Moussaoui, that 9/11 might have been prevented.\n  Then when the Judiciary Committee pursues the issue more than a month \nlater at a subsequent hearing, and finds that the key FBI personnel, \nincluding their attorneys, do not know the right standard, it is just \nincredible. Then when the FBI Director does not respond to inquiries as \nto what the standards are, and days, weeks, and months follow, I wonder \nwhat has happened with many matters where terrorists may be plotting \nother attacks and our law enforcement officials are not doing the job.\n  This does raise the very fundamental question of whether the FBI is \ncapable of handling counterterrorism in the United States, and what \nstandards are being applied. Senator Leahy, Senator Grassley, and I \nhave introduced further legislation requiring more reporting. There is \na very important issue about civil liberties, but it all turns on \nappropriate application of the law, and that certainly has not been \nfollowed.\n  I will be sending a copy of this statement to FBI Director Mueller \ntomorrow when it is in print, and these issues will be raised at the \nhearing which is scheduled for next Tuesday. We have a hearing \nscheduled which will include Attorney General Ashcroft, FBI Director \nRobert Mueller, CIA Director George Tenet, and Secretary of Homeland \nDefense Tom Ridge. I am urging Chairman Hatch to break it up and to \nhave only one of those individuals appear. If we have all four of them \nat one time, we will only be hearing opening statements from the \nSenators and opening statements from the individuals, and along about \n1:15, when nobody has gone to lunch, is when we will really get to \nserious questioning, and the hearing will not exactly be fruitful. So \nwe really need to take these very important individuals one at a time. \nSo stay tuned on some questions for FBI Director Mueller.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the letter in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 24, 2002.\n     Hon. Robert Mueller,\n     Director, Federal Bureau of Investigation,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Director Mueller: In a hearing before the Judiciary \n     Committee on June 6, 2002, I questioned you and Special Agent \n     Colleen Rowley about the erroneous standards being applied by \n     the FBI on applications for warrants under the Foreign \n     Intelligence Surveillance Act. I specifically called your \n     attention to the appropriate standards in Illinois v. Gates.\n       On July 10, 2002, I wrote to you concerning a closed door \n     hearing on July 9, 2002 where seven FBI personnel including \n     four attorneys were still unfamiliar with the appropriate \n     standard for probable cause of a FISA warrant under Gates.\n       At a Judiciary Committee hearing on September 10, 2002, I \n     again raised these issues with a representative of the \n     Department of Justice asking why I had not heard about any \n     action taken by the FBI on these issues.\n       On September 12, 2002, my office received an undated letter \n     from Assistant Director John E. Collingwood (copy enclosed) \n     which was a totally inadequate response. My office has since \n     been furnished with a copy of a memorandum from the Federal \n     Bureau of Investigation dated September 16, 2002, entitled \n     ``Probable Cause'' which references the Gates case.\n       I would like an explanation from you as to why it took the \n     FBI so long to disseminate information on the standard for \n     probable cause under Gates for a FISA warrant.\n           Sincerely,\n     Arlen Specter.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            Department of Justice,\n\n\n                              Federal Bureau of Investigation,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 12, 2002.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Specter: I am writing in response to your \n     letter to Director Mueller dated July 10, 2002 regarding the \n     standards applied to applications under the Foreign \n     Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA).\n       As you know, the events of September 11, 2001 caused the \n     entire Government to review all of its programs to identify \n     any revisions which may help to prevent another terrorist \n     attack. The FISA review process is critical to our \n     counterterrorism mission and, even before September 11th, we \n     were working with the Department of Justice (DOJ), as well as \n     the FISA Court, to simplify and expedite the FISA procedures. \n     We have made significant progress including implementation of \n     the\n\n[[Page S2749]]\n\n     FISA procedures to ensure accuracy (known as the ``Woods \n     Procedures''), a copy of which has been provided to the \n     Committee.\n       In addition, we have been crafting new guidance, in \n     consultation with DOJ, to address the FISA process as \n     modified by the USA PATRIOT Act. This guidance will also \n     address the concerns raised in your letter and your meeting \n     with FBI personnel on July 9, 2002. We anticipate approval of \n     the guidance shortly and will immediately disseminate it to \n     field offices for implementation. A copy will be provided to \n     the Committee as well.\n       I appreciate your concerns and your support in these \n     critical matters.

Robert Mueller,\n     Director, Federal Bureau of Investigation,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Director Mueller: Supplementing my letter of September \n     24, 2002, I would like to know how many requests the FBI made \n     for warrants under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act \n     from June 10, 2002, the date of the Judiciary Committee \n     hearing with you and Special Agent Colleen Rowley, and \n     September 16, 2002, the date on the FBI memorandum citing the \n     Gates case.\n       I would also like to know the specifics on what standard of \n     probable cause was used on the applications for warrants \n     under FISA during that period.\n           Sincerely,\n     Arlen Specter.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 10, 2002.\n     Hon. Robert Mueller,\n     Director, Federal Bureau of Investigation,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Director: In a hearing before the Judiciary Committee \n     on June 6, 2002, I called your attention to the standard on \n     probable cause in the opinion of then-Associate Justice \n     Rehnquist in Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 236 (1983) \n     (citations omitted) as follows:\n       As early as Locke v. United States, 7 Cranch. 339, 348, 3 \n     L.Ed. 364 (1813), Chief Justice Marshall observed, in a \n     closely related context, that ``the term `probable cause,' \n     according to its usual acceptation, means less than evidence \n     which would justify condemnation. . . . It imports a seizure \n     made under circumstances which warrant suspicion.'' More \n     recently, we said that ``the quanta . . . of proof'' \n     appropriate in ordinary judicial proceedings are inapplicable \n     to the decision to issue a warrant. Finely-tuned standards \n     such as proof beyond a reasonable doubt or by a preponderance \n     of the evidence, useful in formal trials, have no place in \n     the magistrate's decision. While an effort to fix some \n     general, numerically precise degree of certainty \n     corresponding to ``probable cause'' may not be helpful, it is \n     clear that ``only the probability, and not a prima facie \n     showing, of criminal activity is the standard of probable \n     cause.''\n       In a closed door hearing yesterday, seven FBI personnel \n     handling FISA warrant applications were questioned, including \n     four attorneys.\n       A fair summary of their testimony demonstrated that no one \n     was familiar with Justice Rehnquist's definition from Gates \n     and no one articulated an accurate standard for probable \n     cause.\n       I would have thought that the FBI personnel handling FISA \n     applications would have noted that issue from the June 6th \n     hearing; or, in the alternative, that you are other \n     supervisory personnel would have called it to their \n     attention.\n       It is obvious that these applications, which are frequently \n     made, are of the utmost importance to our national security \n     and your personnel should not be applying such a high \n     standard that precludes submission of FISA applications to \n     the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.\n       I believe the Judiciary Committee will have more to say on \n     this subject but I wanted to call this to your attention \n     immediately so that you could personally take appropriate \n     corrective action.\n           Sincerely,\n     Arlen Specter.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            Department of Justice,\n\n\n                              Federal Bureau of Investigation,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Specter: I am writing in response to your \n     letter to Director Mueller dated July 10, 2002 regarding the \n     standards applied to applications under the Foreign \n     Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA).\n       As you know, the events of September 11, 2001 caused the \n     entire Government to review all of its programs to identify \n     any revisions which may help to prevent another terrorist \n     attack. The FISA review process is critical to our \n     counterterrorism mission and, even before September 11th, we \n     were working with the Department of Justice (DOJ), as well as \n     the FISA Court, to simplify and expedite the FISA procedures. \n     We have made significant progress including implementation of \n     the FISA procedures to ensure accuracy (known as the ``Woods \n     Procedures''), a copy of which has been provided to the \n     Committee.\n       In addition, we have been crafting new guidance, in \n     consultation with DOJ, to address the FISA process as \n     modified by the USA PATRIOT Act. This guidance will also \n     address the concerns raised in your letter and your meeting \n     with FBI personnel on July 9, 2002. We anticipate approval of \n     the guidance shortly and will immediately disseminate it to \n     field offices for implementation. A copy will be provided to \n     the Committee as well.\n       I appreciate your concerns and your support in these \n     critical matters. Please contact me if you have any \n     questions.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                          John E. Collingwood,\n\n                                     Assistant Director, Office of\n     Public and Congressional Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n                    Federal Bureau of Investigation\n\n     To: All Divisions.\n     From: Office of the General Counsel.\n\n\n                             probable cause\n\n       Synopsis: The purpose of this Electronic Communication is \n     to clarify the meaning of probable cause.\n       Details: In recent legislative hearings, questions have \n     been raised about the concept of probable cause as it applies \n     to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). While \n     FBI Agents receive substantial legal training and have ample \n     experience applying the concept in their daily work, it is \n     nonetheless helpful to review the case law defining probable \n     cause. Accordingly, the Office of the General Counsel \n     prepared the following summary for the benefit of all FBI \n     Agents.\n       In Illinois versus Gates, 462 U.S. 213 (1983, the Supreme \n     Court explained that the probable cause standard is a \n     practical, nontechnical concept which deals with \n     probabilities--not hard certainties--derived from the \n     totality of the circumstances in a factual situation. \n     Probable cause to believe a particular contention is \n     determined by evaluating ``the factual and practical \n     considerations of everyday life on which reasonable and \n     prudent men, not legal technicians, act;'' it is a ``fluid \n     concept . . . not readily, or even usefully, reduced to a \n     neat set of legal rules.'' 462 U.S. at 231-32.\n       The courts have broadly defined the parameters of probable \n     cause. While it requires more than an unfounded suspicion, \n     courts have repeatedly explained that probable cause requires \n     a lesser showing than the rigorous evidentiary standards \n     employed in trial proceedings. In Gates, 462 U.S. at 235, the \n     Supreme Court explained that probable cause is less demanding \n     than the evidentiary standards of beyond a reasonable doubt, \n     preponderance of the evidence or even a prima facie case--all \n     that is required to establish probable cause is a ``fair \n     probability'' that the asserted contention is true. It is \n     particularly important to note that probable cause is a lower \n     standard than ``preponderance of the evidence,'' which is \n     defined as the amount of evidence that makes a contention \n     more likely true than not true. See, e.g., United States \n     versus Bapack, 129 F.3d 1320, 1324 (D.C. Cir. 1997) \n     (preponderance standards means ``more likley than not''); \n     United States versus Montague, 40 F.3d 1251, 1255 (D.C. Cir. \n     1994) (``more probable than not''), BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY \n     1064 (5th ed. 1979) (``[e]vidence which is of greater weight \n     or more convincing than the evidence which is offered in \n     opposition to it''). Since probable cause is a lower standard \n     than preponderance of the evidence, an Agent can demonstrate \n     probable cause to believe a factual contention without \n     proving that contention even to a 51 percent certainty, as \n     required under the preponderance of the evidence standard. \n     See, e.g., United States versus Cruz, 834 F.2d 47, 50 (2d \n     Cir. 1987) (probable cause does not require a showing that it \n     is more probable than not that a crime has been committed); \n     Paff versus Kaltenbach, 204 F.3d 425, 436 (3d Cir. 2000) \n     (probable cause is a lesser showing than preponderance of the \n     evidence); United States versus Limares, 269 F.3d 794, 798 \n     (7th Cir. 2001) (same); United States versus Mounts, 248 F.3d \n     712, 715 (7th Cir. 2001) (probable cause does not require a \n     showing that it is more likely than not that the suspected \n     committed a crime).\n       Courts have instructed judges to apply no higher standard \n     when they review warrants for probable cause. The magistrate \n     reviewing an application for a criminal search warrant ``is \n     simply to make a practical, common-sense decision whether, \n     given all the circumstances set forth in the affidavit before \n     him, . . . there is a fair probability that contraband or \n     evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.'' \n     Gates, 462 U.S. at 238. As to arrest warrants, the question \n     for the magistrate is whether the totality of the facts and \n     circumstances set forth in the affidavit are ``sufficient to \n     warrant a prudent man in believing that the [suspect] had \n     committed'' the alleged offense--an evaluation that ``does \n     not require the fine resolution of conflicting evidence that \n     a reasonable-doubt or even a preponderance standard \n     demands.'' Gerstin versus Pugh, 420 U.S. 103, 111-12, 121 \n     (1975).\n       Similarly, a judge of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \n     Court reviewing an application for a FISA electronic \n     surveillance order or search warrant must make a probable \n     cause determination based on a practical, common-sense \n     assessment of the circumstances set forth in the declaration. \n     The judge must first find probable cause that the target of \n     the surveillance or search is a foreign power or an agent of \n     a foreign power. While certain non-U.S. persons can qualify\n\n[[Page S2750]]\n\n     as agents of a foreign power merely by acting in the United \n     States as an officer or employee of a foreign power, a U.S. \n     person can be found to be an agent of a foreign power only if \n     the judge finds probable cause to believe that he or she is \n     engaged in activities that involve (or in the case of \n     clandestine intelligence gathering activities ``may \n     involve'') certain criminal conduct. 50 U.S.C. 1801(b). For \n     an electronic surveillance order to issue under FISA, the \n     judge must additionally find that there is probable cause to \n     believe that each of the facilities or places to be \n     electronically surveilled is being used, or is about to be \n     used, by a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power. 50 \n     U.S.C. 1805(a)(3). For a FISA search warrant, the judge must \n     find probable cause to believe that the premises or property \n     to be searched is owned, used, possessed by or in transit to \n     or from a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power. 50 \n     U.S.C. 1824(a)(3).\n       We hope this summary clarifies the meaning of probable \n     cause. Agents with questions about probable cause in a case \n     should consult with their Chief Division Counsel, the Office \n     of the General Counsel, or the Assistant United States \n     Attorney or Justice Department attorney assigned to the case.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I think Members on both sides of the \naisle greatly respect the work of our colleague on the FBI and we \nappreciate his work.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank my colleague from New York for the generous \ncomments.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Well deserved, not just in my opinion but in the opinion \nof many Members.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I will continue our discussion on so many \nissues facing the Nation. Obviously, in the Senate the business is the \nbusiness of Miguel Estrada. I will comment on that in a few minutes.\n  I do want to say, however, that some on the other side are attempting \nto convey the impression that it is we, the Democrats, who continue the \ndebate on Miguel Estrada. We do not. We have, indeed, asked Mr. Estrada \nto answer the most rudimentary questions that every person who seeks to \nachieve a lifetime appointment of the high office of judge of the DC \nCircuit Court of Appeals is asked to answer. There are a large number \nof Members who will not move to vote until those questions are \nanswered. That seems to be entirely logical.\n  Let me make clear the reason we continue to debate Mr. Estrada--not \nthe economy, not homeland security, not the many issues that our \nconstituents are asking about--is the choice not of the Democratic \nminority but of the Republican majority that controls the floor.\n  In fact, 2 weeks ago, when the Republican majority thought they ought \nto get other things done, they have. We actually approved three other \njudges at the majority leader's request. We left the subject of Mr. \nEstrada and debated those judges. We approved the omnibus budget--late, \nof course--but we approved that budget, the largest amount of Federal \nspending we have ever voted on, debated it, amended it, while the \nEstrada nomination was still pending.\n  I ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, until we resolve \nthis impasse about who Mr. Estrada is and what he actually believes, \nwhat his judicial philosophy is, and get the best evidence--not hearsay \nevidence because there is hearsay evidence on both sides--that we do \nmove to other issues.\n  When I go to New York, virtually none of my constituents ask me about \nMiguel Estrada. Yes, you will get some editorials and you get some talk \nshows talking about him one way or the other. But not average voters. \nNot even any voter except those in the political class.\n  My constituents are asking me about the war, when we might go to war \nand what is happening. I get a lot of negative comments about France, \nwhich I am sympathetic toward--not France but the negative comments. \nAnd more than that I get questions about the economy. I get question \nafter question after question: What are you guys in Washington doing \nabout the economy?\n  This morning I flew back from New York and the man at the gate of the \nairport, obviously somebody who makes an average salary working for \nDelta Airlines, asked me: Senator, when are you guys going to get the \neconomy going?\n  We on this side would love to start debating on the economy. We would \nlove to start talking about how we will get people to work. As our \nminority leader, Tom Daschle, put it so well yesterday, the Republicans \non the other side of the aisle are concerned about one job, that of Mr. \nEstrada. And by the way, he already has a job. My guess is he is being \npaid well into the six figures. He can live quite a nice life, as he \ndeserves, on that ample salary.\n\n  But what about the 2.8 million Americans who have lost jobs? What \nabout the tens of millions of other Americans who have jobs, but they \nare not getting the salaries they used to get in terms of buying power? \nWhat about all the companies, the small businesses, that say the \nbusiness climate is not good enough so they can expand? What about the \nlarge businesses? I was reading my clips here and some of the largest \ncompanies in upstate New York have stopped putting dollars into \nresearch or decreased the amount of money they are putting into \nresearch, which is the lifeblood of our future, our information-based \neconomy, because very simply, the economy is so squishy soft.\n  We have plans to deal with the economy. We would like to debate them. \nI was told this morning that many think the majority leader will not \neven bring up a stimulus package until late spring. We cannot afford to \nwait. We can sit here and make the speeches.\n  Do you know how many times I have heard that Mr. Estrada graduated \nfrom Harvard Law School? It is not new news. We are not making any new \npoints in this debate. I guess every one of the Senators could answer \nthis question: How many former Solicitors General have said that the \nrecords should not be revealed? We have heard that probably 100 times \non the floor. No new ground is being broken in this debate.\n  Yet for some strange reason the majority leader seeks to keep us on \nthis issue. We all know what the issue is. It is a simple issue. That \nis, many Members believe Mr. Estrada has to tell not only the Senate \nbut the American people--because the Founding Fathers regarded us as a \nmechanism by which the American people could learn--his views on \nfundamental issues. What is his view of the first amendment and whether \nit is an expansive view or narrowing view?\n  Right now we are faced with the age-old conflict between security and \nliberty as we debate the PATRIOT Act. It is all challenged in court. \nWhat are Mr. Estrada's views? How does he see it? Is he hard on the \nsecurity side? Is he hard on the liberty side? What are his views on \nthe commerce clause?\n  We all know that there is a move among many Justices in the Supreme \nCourt and judges in the courts of appeals to narrow that commerce \nclause. Some want to narrow it, in my opinion, so severely we could go \nback not to the 1930s but the 1890s.\n  The American people are entitled to know his views. They are not \nsimply entitled to know that Mr. Seth Waxman says he is a good fellow. \nThat is not an answer.\n  I am sure my colleague from Pennsylvania would admit if he were here, \ndirect evidence is a lot better than hearsay evidence. There are \nvarious ways you get direct evidence. One is by asking a witness \nquestions. As anyone who has read the transcript of the hearing that I \nchaired for Mr. Estrada, he went to every length to avoid any answers \nthat were substantive on any direct questions. I have never seen \nanything like it.\n  Of course, subsequent to Mr. Estrada answering that way, I believe \nthere are new nominees saying the same thing. But none of the nominees \nbefore were ever so restrictive. And I believe the only reason the \nothers have not answered questions, they were afraid they would \nembarrass Mr. Estrada, acting at the request of the White House. It is \na good guess he has been instructed not to answer these.\n  Another way is to look at somebody's past history. There is only one \nplace where we can find Mr. Estrada's own views in his past history \nbecause he has written very little.\n  He clearly was not previously a judge; he was a lawyer. He was \nobviously representing clients; that is, by his writings and by his \nviews when he was in the Solicitor General's office. There are some who \nsay those should not be revealed. There are arguments on that side. But \nthere are no legal arguments and there is plenty of precedent on the \nother side.\n\n[[Page S2751]]\n\n  Should everybody who worked in the Solicitor General's Office have to \nreveal such information? Probably it would be better. I believe in \nopenness. But it wouldn't be essential because just about every nominee \nwho has come before us for this kind of high court has had some kind of \nrecord.\n  There are some who say Mr. Estrada is way to the right of Justice \nScalia. If that is true, he should not be approved. If, on the other \nhand, he is a mainstream conservative, he should be approved.\n  Of the 106 people the President nominated for judge for whom we \nvoted, on whom we have had votes here in the Senate, I have supported \n98, 99, or 100 of them. I am sure the vast majority of those were \nmainstream conservatives--people I might disagree with on this issue or \nthat. But the real issue here is, Is Mr. Estrada so far out of the \nmainstream on the second highest court in the land that if the American \npeople knew his views they would be aghast?\n  Do you know what many people say when they hear this argument? When I \nwent back home and anyone asked me--as I said, almost no one did--but \nwhen I was asked or when I entered an opinion, there was not a soul who \nwould disagree that he should reveal what he thinks. There is too much \npower in this awesome lifetime appointment not to do so.\n  So the issue is drawn. We know the issue. No one has budged over the \nlast 2 to 3 weeks.\n  Why are we still debating Estrada? Because the Republican majority \ninsists on doing it. Maybe they think they can win political points. I \ndoubt it. I think most people do not care. Maybe they feel so strongly \nthat they want to keep the Senate tied up. I will tell you, if they do, \nthey are not representing what the American people want, which is \ndebate on other issues.\n  The two issues I think we should be debating now are the economy and \nwhat we are doing about homeland security. Those two issues, in my \njudgment, are the two that have a real impact. We have disagreements on \nthe war. We know that. That is now pretty much in executive branch \nhands. But what to do about homeland security and what to do about the \neconomy or what the American people are asking us to do--and I will say \nto you, ladies and gentlemen of America--the reason we are not debating \nthose extremely serious issues is because the Republican majority \ninsists that we stay on the Estrada issue.\n  If I heard from the other side new arguments that might convince \npeople, I would say, well, maybe they have a point. But a new argument \nhas not been made on this issue for a week or two. Do you know what. If \nsomeone comes up with an ingenious argument that might convince a \nnumber of Members on this side, we can go back and debate Mr. Estrada. \nBut right now, I will challenge my good friends, my Republican \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle, to start doing something \nabout the economy. Let us debate that issue.\n  Again, I say this to the American people. We do not control the \nfloor.\n  When they say Democrats are filibustering on Mr. Estrada, that is not \ntrue. It is the Republican side that is keeping us debating the issue \nof Mr. Estrada. They say until you see it our way, we are going to stay \nwith Mr. Estrada. If this were the No. 1 issue most Americans think \nshould be tackled, they might have a point. But it isn't, although I am \nafraid some of my colleagues are sort of out of touch.\n\n  I want to quote my good friend, the junior Senator from Pennsylvania, \nMr. Santorum. He came out of a White House meeting, according to the \nNational Journal, and said that getting Estrada to the Senate was first \nand foremost on President Bush's mind.\n  More important than the war in Iraq? More important than protecting \nour homeland? More important than starting the economy going and \ngetting the jobs we need? I don't think more than 1 percent of the \nAmerican people would agree with that analysis. If so, the President \nought to rethink. If Mr. Santorum is properly reporting on President \nBush's views that Estrada is first and foremost, then the President \nought to get out on the hustings and start talking to the American \npeople and finding out what is on their minds because it isn't Mr. \nEstrada.\n  I would like to talk about one thing about the economy which I think \nis important. Today, along with my colleague from New Jersey, Senator \nCorzine, and my colleague from Michigan, Ms. Stabenow, and my colleague \nfrom Delaware, Senator Carper, all members of the Banking Committee, we \nput in a sense-of-the-Congress resolution that says the independence of \nthe Federal Reserve Board should be preserved; that praises Chairman \nGreenspan as an independent voice and that asks this Senate to go on \nrecord in support of Mr. Greenspan.\n  Why have we done that? Very simply, 2 weeks ago Mr. Greenspan, before \nour Banking Committee, was his usual independent self. He said that \nwhile he likes the dividend tax cut, that he was so worried about \nplunging this Nation into fiscal chaos with huge deficits that we only \nought to do it if it could be revenue-neutral--in other words, if we \ncould find other cuts in spending or other increases in taxes that \nwould equal the dividend tax cut--a view, by the way, that I find is \ncorroborated by most of the business leaders I talk to.\n  Right after that happened, there were reports in all the newspapers \nthat the White House was furious at Alan Greenspan. Bob Novak said in \nhis column--which I believe was entitled, ``Goodbye Greenspan?''--the \nWhite House was so angry at Alan Greenspan's show of display of \nindependence that they might not reappoint him.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I will be happy to yield in a few minutes. I want to \nfinish my point.\n  When the Federal Reserve Board was set up, it was supposed to be \nindependent. That is why it was a board. That is why the appointments \nare for such lengths of time. If you go back and read the history, it \nwas set up to be as far removed from the political forces within the \nWhite House and elsewhere as it could be. Sometimes the independence of \nChairman Greenspan benefits the White House.\n  Two years ago, many of us on this side of the aisle were quite upset \nwith him when he encouraged a tax cut that many economists thought \nseemed too high--not that there shouldn't have been a tax cut, but that \nit was too large. At that point, the White House was very happy with \nthe independence of the chairman. Now he said something else. Our \neconomy is weaker. We have a large deficit. It is getting worse. The \nWhite House, which says we have no money for homeland security and no \nmoney to help the States out of their problems, has $670 billion for a \ntax cut.\n  I tend to like tax cuts. I tend to support them. But they ought to be \nstimulative to the economy. They ought to be fair. In other words, the \nmiddle-class people ought to get a good, decent share of the benefit. \nAnd they ought to be responsible. They ought not throw us into such \nlarge deficits that our economy has a burden on its shoulders for a \ndecade. Chairman Greenspan was saying on the last point that we need to \ncorrect it.\n  When I mentioned this resolution in the Banking Committee a few hours \nago, I was glad to hear that three or four of my Republican colleagues, \nincluding Chairman Shelby, said that Alan Greenspan was a fine man, \nthat the Federal Reserve Board ought to be independent, and that he \nought to be reappointed.\n  I ask unanimous consent right now to bring up that amendment, to \nbring up that sense-of-the-Senate resolution because that would help \ncalm the markets that are jittery enough as they are right now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BURNS. I object.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I understand that my colleague objected. It didn't \nsurprise me.\n  But, again, on the issue of great importance to Americans, the state \nof this economy, and the independence of the Federal Reserve Board and \nthe need that we don't just become profligate with the tax cut or the \nspending side, the other side wants not to debate that subject and \ncontinue debating Mr. Estrada.\n  I am happy to debate it. I have been on this floor for many hours. \nBut, again, there are no new arguments that come out. I think every one \nof us could take a quiz on the three major points the Republican side \nmakes and the Democrat side makes. So I say to my\n\n[[Page S2752]]\n\ncolleagues, it is time to move on. There is another issue I think we \nshould move on to.\n  I am going to yield just for the purposes of a question to my \ncolleague because I am going on to another little area.\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank the Senator from New York.\n  The reason I objected is, that is not the issue at hand on the floor \nnow, and the proper people are not on the floor to strengthen or weaken \nhis argument on Mr. Greenspan.\n  But I have been watching the debate on Miguel Estrada with a great \ndeal of interest. I would agree with my friend from New York in that I \nhave traveled through my whole State--not the whole State, but a goodly \npart of it--and it is not the first question we are asked in townhall \nmeetings or in an occasional meeting on the street.\n  I understand, though, that the Senator from New York questioned Mr. \nEstrada for about 90 minutes or so in committee. And I think it is \ngeneral practice here that if you have more questions, even after the \ncommittee hearing is over, you submit written questions. I would \ninquire of my friend from New York: Did you send Mr. Estrada any \nwritten questions after the hearing, after he was voted out of \ncommittee and his nomination was brought to the floor?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Let me respond to my colleague, I did not. I usually do \nsend written questions. I had ample time to question Mr. Estrada. I got \nto ask a lot of the questions I wanted to ask. There was one problem: I \ngot no answers. When I asked Mr. Estrada his views on, say, the 1st \namendment, or on the commerce clause, or on the 11th amendment, I got \nback an answer that I found extremely unsatisfying. Some might call it \ndisingenuous. I am not going to go that far. He said: Senator, I will \nfollow the law.\n  Of course, every judge believes they are following the law. But if \nfollowing the law was all one needed to say, we would not need a \nconfirmation process. How Justice Scalia thinks we ought to follow the \nlaw is quite different than how Justice Breyer or Justice Thomas thinks \nwe ought to follow the law.\n  If simply following the law told us how a judge would vote on the \nmost important issues, then why is it that judges who tend to be \nappointed by Republican Presidents--not always, but usually--vote quite \ndifferently than judges who get appointed by Democratic Presidents? It \nis because even as you follow the law, your own views always influence \nyou as a judge. And the higher the court is, and the more important the \ncourt is, the more that is the case, because there are fewer \nprecedents.\n  In fact, I commend to my good friend from Montana a study done by \nProfessor Sunstein of the University of Chicago. He looked at this very \nDC Court of Appeals, and he said there were huge differences on just \nabout every issue between the judges appointed by Democratic Presidents \nand judges appointed by Republican Presidents.\n  So the bottom line is, I asked Mr. Estrada, and first he said: I \ncan't answer these questions because it might influence me when I have \nto make a future decision. And he cited the canons of ethics. We all \nknow that the canons of ethics means you cannot say: Well, there is a \ncase over there about the logging standards in the Sawtooth Mountains. \nI think those are in Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. You got the right mountains, but you have got the wrong \nState.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Idaho. My family and I have traveled through there, and \nit is a beautiful part of America. We go hiking out there every summer, \nalthough I am sure my friend from Montana would think not enough of the \nWest has rubbed off on me yet, but we are trying.\n  But in any case, that prospective nominee should not answer. But if \nyou ask a prospective nominee his views or her views on: What are your \ngeneral views on how much leeway the Federal Government has versus the \nState governments on how logging should be done or how the environment \nshould be regulated? I would argue to my colleague from Montana that is \nexactly what we should be asking the nominee, and that is exactly what \nthey should be answering.\n  Let me read you a quote from your leader on the Judiciary Committee. \nHe said, on February 18, 1997, before the University of Utah Federalist \nSociety:\n\n       Determining which of President Clinton's nominees will \n     become activists is complicated and it will require the \n     Senate to be more diligent and extensive in its questioning \n     of nominees' jurisprudential views.\n\n  That is exactly what we are saying. He was asked by Senator Feinstein \nhis views on Roe v. Wade. Now, I do not believe in a litmus test, and I \nwould say, of the 99 or so judges I voted for, who were nominated by \nPresident Bush, most of them disagree with my view on choice, but I \nvoted for them because they were mainstream conservatives. They were \nmainstream.\n  Mr. BURNS. Will the Senator further yield?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I will yield when I finish my point.\n  But when Miguel Estrada was asked if he had any personal views on Roe \nv. Wade, he said, no--something to that effect. I said to him: Name \nthree Supreme Court cases already decided that you do not like. There \nwould be no worry about the canons of ethics. And guess what he said. \n``I won't answer.''\n  So after 90 minutes of basically being stonewalled, there was no \nfurther point in asking written questions and getting the same answers. \nIt is not that we did not ask the questions. We asked him a ton of \nquestions, my colleague from Illinois and all the members of the \nJudiciary Committee. He just simply dead flat refused to answer them. \nAnd that when you are being nominated for the second most important \ncourt in the land, a court that is going to have huge power over every \none of our lives.\n  That is not what the Founding Fathers intended. You read The \nFederalist Papers. It is not fair to this Senate. It makes a mockery of \nthe process. And most of all, I say to my good friend from Montana, it \nis not fair to the American people. Because the judiciary is the one \nunelected branch of Government. It is where the people have the least \nsay. That is why sometimes it garners such fervent opinions, pro and \ncon. But the only chance you have--before this lifetime appointment \npasses--is at this point. And, in all fairness, I cannot think of \nanybody who has shown less of what he thinks about the major issues of \nthe day before nomination than Mr. Estrada. I am sure my colleague \nwould agree with me, if you asked 100 Americans: Should nominees for \nsuch awesome positions be--not required--but should they reveal their \nviews? I bet 99 or 98 would say: Yes.\n  So I just want to make one other point. I see my other colleagues are \nin the Chamber. There is another issue--I am going to yield.\n  I ask the Senator, do you have another question?\n  Mr. BURNS. Being that the Senate is made up of about 65 to 70 percent \nattorneys--and I not being one of those--that was the longest ``yes, I \ndid not ask him any further questions in written form'' I have ever \nheard. But we have to contend with that in this body.\n  I watched those hearings with a great deal of interest because I \nbelieve, as does the Senator from New York, this is a very sensitive \nand important part of our role in the Senate. However, I think we have \ninjected a double standard here in this case. And I think that case has \nbeen made here. But I would say after----\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, just reclaiming my time, I would say it \nhas been made about 50 times--not very well, in my judgment but 50 \ntimes.\n  Mr. BURNS. If I may finish my question. Didn't he answer that \nquestion just about the same as the nominees sent up by the previous \nPresident of the United States? That is what I am going back to.\n  Like the Senator from New York, I think we should be moving on. I \ncontend that we have talked about this, we have discussed it and \ndebated it. The only thing I am saying is let's just vote on him.\n  I plan to come back to the Chamber later today to make a statement. I \nwas interested in the Senator's discussion and his statement. I thank \nmy good friend from New York for responding to the question.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I appreciate that.\n  Mr. President, let me say this. I don't have all of the nominees \nhere. I have been on the Judiciary Committee for 4 years. I have not \ncome across a nominee to the court of appeals, when given\n\n[[Page S2753]]\n\nso many extensive questions, who had so few answers as Miguel Estrada.\n  I don't think there is a double standard. I will quote one. Probably, \nthe nominee of President Clinton that garnered the most controversy--\nbecause my colleagues on the other side thought he was too far out of \nthe mainstream from the left side--happened to be a Hispanic nominee \nnamed Richard Paez. As the Senator knows, he was held up for over 1,500 \ndays. Let me read the same question that was asked of Mr. Paez--by the \nway, these were asked by your colleague, my colleague, our friend, \nSenator Sessions. Senator Sessions asked him:\n\n       In your opinion, what is the greatest Supreme Court \n     decision in American history?\n\n  Did Judge Paez refuse to answer that question, say he could not, as \nMr. Estrada did? No. He right away named Brown v. Board of Education.\n  Senator Sessions then asked the same question I asked of Mr. Estrada. \nHe said:\n\n       What is the worst Supreme Court decision?\n\n  Again, Paez answered without hesitation, without ducking, without \nhiding behind some legal subterfuge--which I know my colleague from \nMontana doesn't like--that it was Dred Scott.\n  So if these questions were fair to ask Judge Paez, why are they not \nfair to ask Miguel Estrada?\n  One other point I will make rhetorically is, we have heard some \ncharges here--not directed at any one of us specifically--that asking \nMr. Estrada all these questions means we are against Hispanics. Why \nwasn't asking these questions of Judge Paez anti-Hispanic? If you want \nto talk about a double standard, the double standard, I am afraid, has \nbeen brought up by many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nwho seem to think it was perfectly OK then.\n  This is what Senator Hatch said about another Hispanic nominee. Her \nname was Rosemary Barkett--a Hispanic nominee, by the way, with the \nsame kind of rags-to-riches story--well, Miguel Estrada didn't come \nfrom poverty, but it was the same quick advancement story. She tried to \nbecome a nun. She worked in schools and made herself a lawyer--very \nadmirable, with high ratings from the American Bar Association. Same \nthing. This is what our good friend, Orrin Hatch, said:\n\n       I led the fight to oppose Judge Barkett's confirmation . . \n     . because her judicial records indicated that she would be an \n     activist who would legislate from the bench.\n\n  Why isn't what's good for the goose good for the gander? Senator \nHatch believed--and nobody on this side stopped him--that he had to ask \nthis nominee, who also happens to be Hispanic--a Mexican American, not \nfrom Central America--a whole lot of questions. He had to go through \nher records and now all of a sudden when Miguel Estrada comes up, not \nonly are we being told we should not ask questions, but it is a \n``double standard'' because he is Hispanic. I think the double standard \ncomes from the people who are making that charge on the other side. \nThey ought to look in the mirror.\n\n  I yield to my colleague from Nevada for a question.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from New York is a member of the Judiciary \nCommittee, true?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I am indeed.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator is familiar with the record of the Judiciary \nCommittee during the time Democrats were in control of the Senate, \ntrue?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I am.\n  Mr. REID. Is it true that a hundred judges were approved during that \nshort period of time when we were in control of the Senate?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Exactly true.\n  Mr. REID. Breaking all records.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Yes. Senator Leahy, our chairman, made every effort to \nbring nominees through. When I tell my constituents--the few who care \nabout this, frankly, because most of them want us to talk about the \neconomy or homeland security--that we have approved something like 99 \nout of 106 nominees, a lot of them said we approved too many. Everyone \nshould not be rubberstamped.\n  Mr. REID. If I may ask another question. It is also true, is it not, \nthat during this session of the legislature, the three judges brought \nbefore us other than Estrada have been approved unanimously?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. My colleague is exactly correct. I brought this up \nbefore while we were debating Miguel Estrada, so we could go off the \nEstrada issue to debate the economy and homeland security, which my \ngood friend from Montana had the good grace to say is also far more on \nthe minds of his constituents.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will yield for another question, is the \nSenator aware that a poll was conducted by the Pew Research Center. You \nare familiar with polls, as I am.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I am not familiar with that particular one, but Pew \nResearch has a good reputation.\n  Mr. REID. They did a poll of 1,254 people that was completed on \nFebruary 18. Is the Senator aware that in that poll, the people were \nasked how President Bush was handling the economy? Is the Senator aware \nthat 43 percent of the people approved of the way President Bush was \nhandling the economy and 48 percent disapproved?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I was not aware of that poll.\n  Mr. REID. Is the Senator aware of the fact that Senator Daschle, the \nDemocratic leader, came to the floor yesterday and asked that a bill \nthat had been moved by the majority leader the day before, a rule 14, \nS. 414, is the Senator aware that Senator Daschle asked unanimous \nconsent to bring that bill to the floor so we could start talking about \na way to maybe improve President Bush's numbers as it relates to the \neconomy and talk about stimulating the economy? S. 414, is the Senator \naware that it was objected to?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I am aware of that. I was sitting on the floor when \nSenator Daschle brought it up. He made an excellent point, I thought. \nHe said the other side seemed to be concerned about one man's job, \nMiguel Estrada.\n  By the way--and Senator Daschle didn't say this--Mr. Estrada already \nhas a job. My guess is that he is probably making in the high six \nfigures, so he can do pretty well feeding his family.\n  Mr. BURNS. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. In a minute, I will be delighted to yield.\n  We have 2.8 million fewer Americans in jobs than we had when \nPresident Bush took office. We have tens of millions of Americans who \nhave jobs, but their jobs are not as good as the jobs they used to \nhave. We should be debating that issue.\n  I say to my colleague from Nevada and my colleague from Montana that \nwe should be debating homeland security, which is vital to our future. \nThose of us who follow football, or basketball, or baseball know that a \ngood team needs both a good offense and a good defense. There are many \nopinions on the offense, but clearly President Bush has a plan and has \nimplemented it. I have been sometimes critical, but usually supportive, \nof the President's plan in that regard. But a good team needs defense.\n  On homeland security, this country is not doing close to what we need \nto do. Even if, God willing, tomorrow we were to get rid of Saddam \nHussein, Osama bin Laden, and al-Qaida, other groups would come \nforward. Are we protected from shoulder-held missile launchers? Are our \nplanes protected? No. Are we protected from somebody smuggling a \nnuclear weapon into this country? Are we doing much about it? No.\n  Is our northern border, which my State shares with Canada for \nhundreds of miles, at all adequately guarded so bad people cannot come \nin? No.\n  Is there money in the President's budget to do these activities? No.\n  I do not know if this is true of my colleague from Montana, but when \nI go back and talk to my police chiefs and fire chiefs of big towns, \nlittle towns, urban areas, rural areas, and suburban areas, does my \ncolleague know what they tell me? They have huge new responsibilities \npost 9/11, and they are not getting one thin dime from Washington. In \nmy opinion, most Americans would rather we debate that than debating \nMiguel Estrada.\n  So we are at an impasse with Estrada. We believe records should be \nrevealed. The other side says: No, let's vote on him without the \nrecords. Nothing has changed in the last week or two. Why don't we just \nput the issue of Mr. Estrada aside until someone a lot smarter than the \nSenator from New\n\n[[Page S2754]]\n\nYork and the Senator from Montana thinks of some kind of compromise, \nbecause right now we are at loggerheads and nothing has budged, and why \ndon't we start talking about the economy, which my colleague from \nNevada brought up; why don't we start talking about homeland security \nas we are on the edge of war with Iraq, which is what, again, my good \nfriend from Montana has admitted his constituents would prefer. I can \ncertainly tell the Senator that my constituents in New York would much \nprefer that.\n  I yield for another question.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I say to my friend from New York, I did not \nget questions on homeland security or the economy while I was up there. \nWe will go over those questions later.\n  I understand what the Senator from New York said about Judge Paez, \nbut in the end, did he get a vote?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I say to my colleague----\n  Mr. BURNS. Yes or no, and I have a followup question.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Wait, in the Senate--I have only been here 4 years, and \nmy colleague has been here longer, but we do not do that yes or no, \ncross-examination stuff. In fact, when I came here, I only spoke for 5 \nor 10 minutes on subjects, and people thought I was crazy, but I am not \ngoing to take that long. I am not going to take more than 5 minutes.\n  At first, Judge Paez, as my friend knows, was held up for 4 years. If \nmy colleague wants to make it equal, start complaining in 2 more years \nabout Judge Estrada. Second, and far more important than the amount of \ntime, Judge Paez had an ample record in the courts. By the way, so \nample that I believe it was 39 Members from the other side--perhaps my \nfriend from Montana; I do not know how he voted--voted against Judge \nPaez, and when Judge Paez came before us and was subjected to extensive \nquestioning by Senator Sessions, by Senator Ashcroft, who was then a \nSenator, by many of my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee, did he \nduck? Did he hide behind the legal shibboleth of: I have to see all the \nbriefs before I answer, or it is a case that might come before me? He \ndid not. He had the courage, he had the decency, and, most of all, he \nhad the respect for the advise and consent process to answer those \nquestions. So he deserved a vote.\n  I say to my colleague, if in 2005 we have a Democratic President--God \nwilling--and if that Democratic President should nominate somebody who \nmany on the other side fear would be so far over to the left that he \nwould do real damage on the bench, I would support my colleagues, if he \ndid not answer questions and had as skimpy a record and did as much of \na job of stonewalling, in not bringing that nominee to a vote as I \nwould today.\n\n  This is not an issue of left or right, in my judgment. It should not \nbe. This is not an issue even of my view, which is: Should ideology \nmatter when you vote for judges? I believe it should, but some do not. \nThis is a matter, in my judgment--and I mean this sincerely to my \ncolleague--that goes to the sacredness of the Constitution of the \nUnited States.\n  When the Founding Fathers, in their wisdom, set up the advice and \nconsent clause, they did not intend it to be degraded by having a sham \nhearing where the witness answers no questions.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, if my friend from New York will allow a \ncomment, and maybe a followup question.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Well----\n  Mr. BURNS. No, a followup question. That is a long way to say, yes, \nhe got a vote. Is it snowing outside today, right now?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Let me say to my colleague that snow comes from the \nclouds, and it happens when the temperature is below 32 degrees up in \nthe clouds.\n  Mr. BURNS. I submit it is snowing inside today also.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer. I thank my good friend from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, it is always a pleasure to debate with my \ncolleague from Montana. I say to my colleague, this, plain and simple, \nhe knows in his heart--I hope he knows; I think he knows--that what \nMiguel Estrada did in terms of how he treated this body--all of us--was \nwrong, and if it is allowed to continue, we will have dramatic changes \nin the way this country is governed, and that is why so many of us feel \nso strongly about this issue.\n  I reiterate to my colleague once more, he is not going to change our \nviews, at least not with the same old arguments. I have been asked \nabout four or five times did Judge Paez get a vote. Let's put this \naside and talk about the issues the American people want us to talk \nabout: the economy and homeland security. If my colleague can get the \nrecord of Mr. Estrada, we will be happy then to bring him to a vote.\n  I thank my colleague. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleague from New York and my seatmate on \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee for the statement he made on this \nimportant nomination. I think he has made this point. I listened \nearlier today when President Bush spoke to the Latino Coalition at the \nWhite House, in the Executive Office Building. I listened to what he \nsaid about Miguel Estrada. I find it difficult to quarrel with any of \nthe statements he said about the man's quality.\n  I met him personally. There is no doubt he has an inspiring life \nstory, having come to the United States from Honduras with limited \nknowledge of English and, in a matter of a few years, reaching the \nheights of a legal education at Harvard Law School. Then, of course, \nthere are his opportunities to serve our Government in a legal \ncapacity, and now in private practice. All of these attest to his legal \nacumen, his legal skills, and the fact he has overcome adversity. Those \nare qualities we want to respect and reward when it comes to those \nseeking public service.\n  The issue before us is one that is narrow in one respect but much \nbroader in another. It is narrow in that we are not questioning his \nacademic or legal credentials or even his experience. I quarrel with \nthose who say he has never been on the bench, in the judiciary. That is \nnot good enough from my point of view. I have seen first timers on the \nbench in Federal and State courts who have done very well.\n  What we are questioning--the narrow aspect--is whether he has been \nforthcoming, honest, and candid in revealing his views on issues, not \ngoing so far as to be intrusive in terms of pending cases before the \ncourt, or not suggesting he answer a question that is a conflict of \ninterest, but rather that he comes to the heart of the question: What \nis in his mind? Is he truly a conservative--and we expect those \nnominees from this President--or is he something more? And if he is \nsomething more, should we pause, should we reflect on this fact? Should \nwe ask the hard question of whether this man is entitled to a lifetime \nappointment to the bench which the President characterized today as the \nsecond highest court in the land, the DC Circuit Court of Appeals?\n  Sadly, when one looks at the record of responses from Miguel Estrada, \nit is unfortunate. It is truly unfortunate because I believe he has \nviews that he can share with us. I believe he certainly has the \nknowledge to answer the questions. But he was coached and trained and \ncautioned not to come to Capitol Hill and be honest and open in his \nanswers.\n  I am sure the people at the Department of Justice said: Miguel, you \nmay want to answer these questions, but do not do it. Trust us, do not \nanswer them. Give them an evasive answer for anything. Try to move on, \nget it behind you, get this to the floor. You have enough votes, and \nyou never have to answer those questions.\n  He probably said at some point: Wait a minute; I do not mind \nanswering a question such as which Supreme Court case do I disagree \nwith. And they said: Be careful. If you start answering those \nquestions, we do not know where this could lead.\n  He followed that advice, or followed someone's advice. He came before \nthe Judiciary Committee and refused to answer the questions.\n  So now we have a broader issue. The broader issue is this: If the \nSenate, and particularly the Judiciary Committee, is to accept this \napproach from nominees, why in the world are we here? Why do we swear \nto uphold this Constitution when it comes to advice and\n\n[[Page S2755]]\n\nconsent? Why is it we go through any process whatsoever with nominees? \nBecause we know if Miguel Estrada comes through under these \ncircumstances, the order of the day will be for future nominees: \nEvasion, concealment, refusal to answer the most basic questions. If \nthat is the case, then, frankly, I think we are not meeting our \nresponsibility.\n  The broader issue is a constitutional responsibility of this Senate. \nIt has been raised before and should be raised again. There is an easy \nway to end this impasse and end it within a matter of days. We have \nasked Miguel Estrada to produce the documents which he generated in the \nSolicitor General's Office, documents which we can review--in fact, we \ncould review them on a restricted basis.\n  One of the Republican Senators I admire very much, Mr. Bennett of \nUtah, suggested these documents be produced and given to Senator Hatch, \na Republican, and Senator Leahy, a Democrat. They can review them. I do \nnot have to see them as a member of the Judiciary Committee. They can \ndecide whether they merit further inquiry, either with written \nquestions or another hearing. If they decide, on the basis of that in \ncamera and private review, that they do not merit that kind of \nfollowup, I will accept Senator Leahy's judgment on that.\n  I do not speak for myself only. Yesterday, Senator Daschle came to \nthe floor and I asked him point blank if Miguel Estrada will produce \nthis documentation, which he says he wants to voluntarily turn over, to \nbe reviewed by Senators Hatch and Leahy, and if there is anything \ncontroversial we have a chance to follow up or not, can this bring the \nmatter to a close, to a vote?\n  I think Senator Daschle spoke for virtually all of us on the Democrat \nside and said: Yes, it can. I think that is a fair way to bring this to \na conclusion.\n  This morning I said to Senator Hatch: Isn't that a way to bring this \nto an end? Isn't that a reasonable way, a dignified way, that does not \nturn loose all these documents for the world to see and for the press \nto pore over but gives it to Senator Hatch and Senator Leahy to review \nthem and see if there is anything that merits a followup?\n  Senator Hatch said: That is absolutely unacceptable. These are \nprivileged documents and never have they been released and we are not \ngoing to start now. Start releasing internal memos and documents like \nthis, and there is no end to it and the White House is right. Despite \nMiguel Estrada's objections, the White House is right to refuse to \nrelease those documents.\n  I call the attention of my colleagues and those following this debate \nto the fact that Senator Hatch perhaps did not tell the whole story \nbecause when we look at requests for writings such as Miguel Estrada's \nwritings, in the past the Department of Justice has provided memos by \nattorneys during the following nominations: William Bradford Reynolds, \nnominated to be Associate Attorney General, the Republican Department \nof Justice provided the documents then. Robert Bork, the \ncontroversial--celebrated in some quarters--nominee to the Supreme \nCourt, he, too, was asked to provide the documents. The Department of \nJustice did. Benjamin Civiletti, nominated to be Attorney General, \nprovided similar documents to this Congress for review by the Senate \nJudiciary Committee; Stephen Trott, nominated to the Court of Appeals \nfor the Ninth Circuit, same standard applied, documents provided from \nthe Department of Justice.\n\n  Finally, I know it is at the bottom of the list and it maybe should \nhave been at the top, Justice William Rehnquist, when he was nominated \nto be Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, was asked by those before me \nwho were members of the Judiciary Committee for memoranda that he had \nprepared. They were provided by the Department of Justice.\n  For Senators' staff and others to argue that this request is patently \nunreasonable, unacceptable, and unprecedented, I suggest that in five \nspecific instances, Democratic and Republican Departments of Justice, \nwith Democratic and Republican Attorneys General, these documents have \nbeen provided.\n  Let me go further. I am going to ask in a moment for these letters to \nbe printed in the Record, but we have letters to the then-chairman of \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee, Joe Biden, from the State of Delaware, \nrelative to the nominations of two individuals, Judge Robert Bork to \nthe Supreme Court--I am sorry. Both of these related to Judge Robert \nBork's nomination to the Supreme Court.\n  It is interesting that the Ronald Reagan Department of Justice, with \na Republican Attorney General, produced the very documents that we are \ndiscussing today, which Senator Hatch and others have said are \nunprecedented, that there has never been a request of this nature.\n  Frankly, in reading the letter of transmittal of presentation from \nthe Department of Justice, we see they decided that in the interest of \ndisclosure, in the interest of openness and candor, that they would \ncooperate, as they say, to the fullest extent possible with the \ncommittee to expedite Judge Bork's confirmation process.\n  And I quote further from this letter signed by John Bolton, Assistant \nAttorney General:\n\n       Accordingly, we have decided to take the exceptional step \n     of providing the committee with access to responsive \n     materials we currently possess, except those privileged \n     documents specifically described above. Of course, our \n     decision to produce these documents does not constitute a \n     waiver of any future claim of privilege.\n\n  And it should not. But in this instance, the Department of Justice, \nwith the Robert Bork nomination to the Supreme Court before them, made \na decision to cooperate with the committee.\n  In this case, Miguel Estrada, realizing he has never sat on the bench \nbefore, and he does not have a body of opinion to which we can turn to \nunderstand his judicial philosophy and thinking, has said he is \nprepared to turn over these memos so we can review them. He believes \nthey are not controversial. He believes they will shed light, perhaps, \non his point of view. I think he is probably right, but we will not \nknow.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Will the Senator yield for and respond to a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to respond to a question.\n  Mr. CRAPO. I have been listening to the arguments the Senator has \nmade. I have been listening very carefully to the examples the Senator \nis pointing out about other nominations in which documents were \nprovided. It is my understanding, however, that the Department of \nJustice has never disclosed confidential deliberative documents on \ncareer lawyers in the Solicitor General's Office. These are documents \ndealing with recommendations on internal deliberations regarding \nappeals and certiorari or amicus recommendations in pending cases.\n\n  From the information I am aware of that the White House has provided \nin each of the cases that the Senator has listed, there is a very clear \ndifference in each of those cases. Take the situation of Judge Bork to \nwhich the Senator was referring. The materials involving Judge Bork \nwere very carefully limited to those that focused on his observations \non political questions, such as President Nixon's assertion of the \nexecutive privilege or the pocket veto. Never has the Department of \nJustice allowed access to internal career lawyers' working documents on \nappeals or on certiorari or amicus recommendations, and that is what I \nunderstand the Senator to be requesting.\n  First, does the Senator understand the distinction that is made \nbetween these document explanations that have been made? And does the \nSenator believe the Senate should start the precedent, which has never \nbeen done in this Senate, of asking for access to these career lawyers' \ndeliberations on confidential matters in the Solicitor's Office?\n  Mr. DURBIN. In response to my colleague, I believe this is a good-\nfaith question and it is one that deserves an honest reply. Do I \nbelieve there are some internal memoranda and writings generated within \nthe Department of Justice that should not be subject to public \ndisclosure? I certainly do. I think lines should be drawn.\n  In the Bork case, the lines were drawn. They said some of the \ndocuments you have requested we will produce in the spirit of \ncooperation; some we cannot and should not produce. And if that is the \nresponse\n\n[[Page S2756]]\n\nfrom the Department of Justice when it comes to Miguel Estrada, we may \nquarrel with their dividing line, but at least it would demonstrate a \ncooperative effort to work with the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  So if they say to us they can give certain memoranda, but they draw \nthe line on others, at least we are moving forward in the process. But \nat this moment in time, I say to my colleague and friend, the \nDepartment of Justice has said flat out: No, not ever; we will not \nproduce anything.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Will the Senator yield further?\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I can finish, and then I will be glad to yield for \nanother question.\n  In the Bork situation, they said: We wish to cooperate to the fullest \nextent possible. We have decided to take the exceptional step of \nproviding the committee with access to responsive materials we \ncurrently possess, except those privileged documents specifically \ndescribed above.\n  The Department of Justice, in the Bork situation, said we are drawing \na line but we are providing you with these internal memos and \ninformation. Now, if the same thing is to apply to Miguel Estrada, as I \nsaid, we can debate where the lines can be drawn, but Mr. Gonzales in \nthe White House said, no, we will not consider producing anything.\n  It leads Members to conclude on this side of the aisle that there is \nsomething very damaging in these materials that they do not want \ndisclosed. It is the only conclusion you can draw. The fact that Miguel \nEstrada volunteered the information, the fact that he is prepared to \nwaive the privilege if it exists, is an indication he does not think \nthe controversy is there, but this White House, tentative and concerned \nabout whether or not Miguel Estrada has said some things that could \njeopardize his nomination, refuses to disclose.\n  I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. CRAPO. If I understand correctly, you are reading that the \ninternal work documents of a career attorney of the Solicitor General's \nOffice in making recommendations on how to handle cases would not be \nsomething this Senate should try to investigate or to cause to be \ndisclosed?\n  In each of the cases you have discussed, either it was specific \ncharges of misconduct about which very narrow documents were disclosed \nor general comments on politics such as the case of Justice Bork. And \nif you are agreeing with that, perhaps there is some progress we can \nmake. It is my understanding the demand for disclosure is far broader \nthan what you have just described.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Let me say in response to my colleague, in the case \ninvolving Robert Bork, I am reading from a letter from Thomas Boyd, the \nActing Assistant Attorney General--and I ask unanimous consent these \nletters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Department of Justice, Office of Legislative and \n           Intergovernmental Affairs,\n                                  Washington, DC, August 24, 1987.\n     Hon. Joseph R. Biden, Jr.,\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Biden: This responds further to your August \n     10th letter requesting certain documents relating to the \n     nomination of Judge Robert Bork to the Supreme Court. \n     Specifically, this sets forth the status of our search for \n     responsive documents and the method and scope of review by \n     the Committee.\n       As we have previously informed you in our letter of August \n     18, the search for requested documents has required massive \n     expenditures of resources and time by the Executive Branch. \n     We have nonetheless, with a few exceptions discussed below, \n     completed a thorough review of all sources referenced in your \n     request that were in any way reasonably likely to produce \n     potentially responsive documents. The results of this effort \n     are as follows:\n       In response to your requests numbered 1-3, we have \n     conducted an extensive search for documents generated during \n     the period 1972-1974 and relating to the so-called Watergate \n     affair. We have followed the same procedure, in response to \n     request number 4, for all documents relating to consideration \n     of Robert Bork for the Supreme Court by President Nixon or \n     his subordinates. We have completed our search and relevant \n     Department of Justice and White House files for documents \n     responsive to these requests. The Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation also has completed its search for responsive \n     documents, focusing on the period October-December 1973 and \n     on references to Robert Bork generally.\n       Most of the documents responsive to requests numbered 1-4 \n     are in the possession of the National Archives and Records \n     Administration, which has custody of the Nixon Presidential \n     materials and the files of the Watergate Special Prosecution \n     Force. The Archives staff supervised and participated in the \n     search of the opened files of the Nixon Presidential \n     materials and the files of the Watergate Special Prosecution \n     Force, which was directed to those files which the Archives \n     staff deemed reasonably likely to contain potentially \n     responsive documents.\n       Pursuant to a request by this Department under 36 C.F.R. \n     1275, the Archives staff also examined relevant unopened \n     files of the Nixon Presidential materials, and, as required \n     under the pertinent regulations, submitted the responsive \n     documents thus located for review by counsel for former \n     President Nixon. Mr. Nixon's counsel, R. Stan Mortenson, \n     interposed no objection to release of those submitted \n     documents that (a) reference, directly or indirectly, Robert \n     Bork, or (b) were received by or disseminated to persons \n     outside the Nixon White House. Mr. Mortenson on behalf of Mr. \n     Nixon objected to production of the documents which are \n     described in the attached appendix. Mr. Mortenson represents \n     that these documents constitute purely internal \n     communications within the White House and contain no direct \n     or indirect reference to Robert Bork.\n       Mr. Mortenson also objected on the same grounds to \n     production of unopened portions of two documents produced in \n     incomplete form from the opened files of the Nixon \n     Presidential materials:\n       1. First page and redacted portion of fifth page of \n     handwritten note of John D. Ehrlichman dated December 11, \n     1972.\n       2. All pages other than the first page of memorandum from \n     Geoff Shepard to Ken Cole dated June 19, 1973.\n       Mr. James J. Hastings, Acting Director of the Nixon \n     Presidential Materials Project, has reviewed these two \n     documents and has advised us that the unopened portions of \n     neither document contain any direct or indirect reference to \n     Judge Bork.\n       Our search has not yielded a copy of the document \n     referenced in paragraph ``a'' of your request numbered 3, \n     which, as you correctly note, is printed at pages 287-288 of \n     the Judiciary Committee's 1973 ``Special Prosecutor'' \n     hearings.\n       Among the documents collected by the Department are certain \n     documents generated in the defense of Halperin. v. Kissinger, \n     Civil Action No. 73-1187 (D. D.C.), a suit filed against \n     several federal officials in their individual capacity, which \n     remains pending. The Department has an ongoing attorney-\n     client relationship with the defendants in Halperin, which \n     precludes us from releasing certain documents containing \n     client confidences and litigation strategy, without their \n     consent. 28 C.F.R. 50.156(a)(3).\n       All documents responsive to request number 5, concerning \n     the pocket veto, have been assembled.\n       All documents responsive to request number 6 have been \n     assembled. The exhibits filed by counsel for Edward S. Miller \n     on July 12, 1978 and referred to in your August 10 letter, \n     remain under seal by order of the United States District \n     Court for the District of Columbia. However, a list of the \n     thirteen documents has been unsealed. We have supplied \n     copies of eleven of these documents, including redacted \n     versions of two of the documents (a few sentences of \n     classified material have been deleted). We have supplied \n     unclassified versions of two of these eleven documents, as \n     small portions of them remain classified. We are precluded \n     by Rule 6(e) of the Rules of Criminal Procedure from \n     giving you access to two other exhibits--classified \n     excerpts of grand jury transcripts--filed on July 12, \n     1978. We also searched the files of several civil cases \n     related to the Felt and Miller criminal prosecution, as \n     well as the documents generated during the consideration \n     of the pardon for Felt and Miller.\n       With respect to request number 7, Judge Bork has previously \n     provided to the Committee a number of his speeches, which we \n     have not sought to duplicate. We have sought and supplied any \n     additional speeches, press conferences or interviews by Mr. \n     Bork, as well as any contemporaneous documents which tend to \n     identify a date or event where he gave a speech or press \n     interview during his tenure at the Department.\n       On request number 8, there are no documents in which \n     President Reagan has set forth the criteria he used to select \n     Supreme Court nominees, or their application to Judge Bork, \n     other than the public pronouncements and speeches we have \n     assembled.\n       Our search for documents responsive to request number 9 has \n     been time-consuming and very difficult, and is not at this \n     time entirely complete. In order to conduct as broad a search \n     as possible, we requested the files in every case handled by \n     the Civil Rights Division or Civil Division, between 1969-77, \n     which concerned desegregation of public education. Although \n     most of these case files have been retrieved, several remain \n     unaccounted for and perhaps have been lost. We expect to have \n     accounted for the remaining files (which may or may not \n     contain responsive documents) in the next few days. We have \n     also assembled some responsive documents obtained from other \n     Department files. The Department of Education is nearing \n     completion of its search of its files, and those of its \n     predecessor agency, HEW.\n\n[[Page S2757]]\n\n       We have assembled case files for the cases referred to in \n     question 10, with the exception of Hill v. Stone, for which \n     there is no file. We have no record of the participation of \n     the United States in Hill v. Stone, or consideration by the \n     Solicitor General's office of whether to participate in that \n     case.\n       A few general searches of certain front office files are \n     still underway, and we expect those searches to be concluded \n     in the next few days. We will promptly notify you should any \n     further responsive documents come into our possession.\n       As you know, the vast majority of the documents you have \n     requested reflect or disclose purely internal deliberations \n     within the Executive Branch, the work product of attorneys in \n     connection with government litigation or confidential legal \n     advice received from or provided to client agencies within \n     the Executive Branch. The disclosure of such sensitive and \n     confidential documents seriously impairs the deliberative \n     process within the Executive Branch, our ability to represent \n     the government in litigation and our relationship with other \n     entities. For these reasons, the Justice Department and other \n     executive agencies have consistently taken the position, in \n     response to the Freedom of Information Act and other \n     requests, that it is not at liberty to disclose materials \n     that would compromise the confidentiality of any such \n     deliberative or otherwise privileged communications.\n       On the other hand, we also wish to cooperate to the fullest \n     extent possible with the Committee and to expedite Judge \n     Bork's confirmation process. Accordingly, we have decided to \n     take the exceptional step of providing the Committee with \n     access to responsive materials we currently possess, except \n     those privileged documents specifically described above and \n     in the attached appendix. Of course, our decision to produce \n     these documents does not constitute a waiver of any future \n     claims of privilege concerning other documents that the \n     Committee requests or a waiver of any claim over these \n     documents with respect to entities or persons other than the \n     Judiciary Committee.\n       As I have previously discussed with Diana Huffman, the \n     other documents will be made available in a room at the \n     Justice Department. Particularly in light of the voluminous \n     and privileged nature of these documents, copies of \n     identified documents will be produced, upon request, only to \n     members of the Judiciary Committee and their staff and only \n     on the understanding that they will not be shown or disclosed \n     to any other persons. Please have your staff contact me to \n     arrange a mutually convenient time for inspection of the \n     documents.\n       As I stressed in my previous letter, if the Committee is or \n     becomes aware of any documents it believes are potentially \n     responsive but have not been produced, please alert us as \n     soon as possible and we will attempt to locate them.\n       Should you have any questions or comments, please contact \n     me as soon as possible. Thank you for your cooperation.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                  Laura Nelson\n\n                                              (For John R.

Joseph R. Biden, Jr.,\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Biden: This letter requests that the \n     Committee return to the Justice Department all copies of \n     documents produced by the Department in response to Committee \n     requests for records relating to the nomination of Robert \n     Bork to the Supreme Court. As Assistant Attorney General John \n     Bolton noted in an August 24, 1987, letter to you, many of \n     the documents provided the Committee, ``reflect or disclose \n     purely internal deliberations within the Executive Branch, \n     the work product of attorneys in connection with government \n     litigation or confidential legal advice received from or \n     provided to client agencies within the Executive Branch.'' We \n     provided these privileged documents to the Committee in order \n     to respond fully to the Committee's request and to expedite \n     the confirmation process.\n       Although the Committee's need for these documents has \n     ceased, their privileged nature remains. As we emphasized in \n     our August 24, 1987, letter, production of these documents to \n     the Committee did not constitute a general waiver of claims \n     of privilege. We therefore request that the Committee return \n     all copies of all documents provided by the Department to the \n     Committee, except documents that are clearly a matter of \n     public record (e.g., briefs and judicial opinions) or that \n     were specifically made a part of the record of the hearings.\n       Please contact me if you have any questions. Thank you for \n     your cooperation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Thomas M. Boyd,\n                                Acting Assistant Attorney General.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. In this May 10, 1988, letter from Thomas Boyd to Joe \nBiden, then-chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee:\n\n       As Assistant Attorney General John Bolton noted in an \n     August 24, 1987, letter to you, many of the documents \n     provided the Committee, ``reflect or disclose purely internal \n     deliberations within the Executive Branch, the work product \n     of attorneys in connection with government litigation or \n     confidential legal advice received from or provided to client \n     agencies within the Executive Branch.'' We provided these \n     privileged documents to the Committee in order to respond \n     fully to the Committee's request and to expedite the \n     confirmation process.\n\n  In response to my friend, the point I am making is they did not draw \nthe same absolute line being drawn by the\n\n[[Page S2758]]\n\nBush White House for Miguel Estrada. They disclosed information which \nreflected purely internal deliberations and the work product of \nattorneys and confidential legal advice and did it in the spirit of \ncooperation. They drew a line, but the line was on the side of \ndisclosure. The line drawn by the Bush White House for Estrada is on \nthe side of concealment, the refusal to disclose this information.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Will the Senator yield further?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. CRAPO. If I understand correctly, you are saying, based on the \nletter, that you indeed are seeking the disclosure of these \nconfidential internal work documents and you believe that letter shows \nthe precedent for disclosure exists, is that correct?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Certainly the precedent exists. The statement made on the \nfloor by Senator Hatch and others that this has never been done or only \nbeen leaked--he used that term this morning--is not a fact.\n  I concede the point made by my colleague that they do draw a line. \nThe Department of Justice said no to everything, but they did disclose \nthe information I just described when it came to Robert Bork. At this \nmoment in time I don't think this Department of Justice has even \nentered into an honest conversation with the Senate Judiciary Committee \nmembers about whether that line can be drawn. They have said \ncategorically that they are not going to allow anything to be produced.\n  That is why we are at this impasse. It is troublesome to have a \nnominee with great credentials, a great resume, a good paying job as an \nattorney in the District of Columbia. He has not served as a judge so \nhe does not have written opinions. We are trying to get to the heart of \nthe matter. What are his values? Is he conservative or something else?\n  Mr. CRAPO. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. CRAPO. I understand your position now, which is that you are \nasking for the disclosure of this broad array of confidential \ndocuments.\n  I assume you are aware that every living former Solicitor General has \nrejected this request. This letter was signed by Democrats Seth Waxman, \nWalter Dellinger, and by Republicans, Ken Starr, Charles Fried, Robert \nBork, and Archibald Cox for the very reasons we have been talking \nabout.\n  I want to get at this principle. Is it the correct policy, is it the \nright thing for us to do in the Senate, to change the practice? I \nunderstand you can list a few cases where there were exceptions in the \nhistory of handling judicial nominations in this country, but if you \nlook at the thousands, indeed tens of thousands of judicial \nnominations, the policy and practice of the Senate has been not to \ndelve into the confidential documents for the very reason every former \nliving Solicitor General has said it would compromise the ability of \nits office to do its work effectively.\n\n  Do you believe it is the right policy for the Senate to begin putting \nsome standard on those who would become nominees of any President, \nRepublican or Democrat, to a position in the U.S. Judiciary? Should we \nopen this door and start demanding that the Solicitor General's Office, \nthe Justice Department, and other contacts, or in any other situation, \nstart revealing these confidential internal work documents by career \nlawyers?\n  (Mrs. DOLE assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. DURBIN. In response, Miguel Estrada does not see a problem with \nthis at all.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Miguel Estrada believes his papers will show support for \nhim. But the principle here is the principle--\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to respond, if I could. In fact, because \nMiguel Estrada does not see a problem with this is an indication to me \nthat perhaps some in the White House are being overly cautious again. \nThey coached Miguel Estrada to come before us and not answer questions \nand now when he says, disclose the memoranda, they are saying, no, no, \nwe did not want the Senate raising that.\n  Going to the point raised by the Senator as to in the history of this \nSenate how often this has occurred, let me reflect on this for a \nmoment. In most instances, this will never happen. There are only a few \nnominees who will come before the Senate who actually have generated \nthis kind of documentation in the Solicitor General's Office or the \nDepartment. And many of those nominees will have an open record as \njudges with their writings to indicate what they believe. And most, if \nnot all, of them will have been responsive to the questions that we \nhave asked of the nominees.\n  We find ourselves backed into this corner with Miguel Estrada because \nhe does not have a body of established opinions as a judge. He does not \nhave an abundance of writings reflecting on his philosophy. He has not \nanswered the questions which we have asked of him. And we are straining \nto find some information on which to base a reasoned judgment about his \nnomination to the second highest court of the land for a lifetime \nappointment.\n  We find ourselves in the difficult, and I think somewhat rare, \nsituation that has been created by Miguel Estrada and the strategy of \nthe White House in sending this nominee to Capitol Hill. I think that \nis rare. I hope it does not happen again.\n  I yield for a question.\n  Mr. CRAPO. It is not just the White House. As I indicated, this is \nevery living former Solicitor General in the United States who is \nsaying this issue goes far beyond the Miguel Estrada nomination. It \ngoes to the core of what the Senate should be dealing with in terms of \nits investigation of judicial nominees and what they can do to our \njudicial system and to the Justice Department in that context.\n  But you indicated also in your answer that Miguel Estrada did not \nanswer the questions asked of him by the Judiciary Committee. I wish to \nclarify this because I understand he would not reveal the documents \nthat we are discussing.\n  Were there any other questions which you asked him or which you are \naware of that he has not answered?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Let me suggest you look at the questions asked of him by \nSenator Kennedy, written questions after the nominee appeared, that \nwent to specific decided cases and asked for his response or reasoning. \nTime after time he came back and said: Well, I have to read all of the \npleadings that were filed and all the briefs that were filed before I \nwould hazard an opinion upon this.\n  Similarly, when Senator Schumer asked him what I thought to be a \nperfectly reasonable question, one that had been asked by Republican \nSenators of Clinton nominees, repeatedly he refused to answer. The \nquestion was one that you would dream of in a constitutional law course \nin law school. The question was: Name a Supreme Court decision in the \nlast 40 years--or a followup question, at any time in its history--that \nyou would find objectionable.\n  If that were the question on the final at law school, you would \nbreathe a sigh of relief. You can think of one case with which you \ndisagree. But this man, seeking a lifetime appointment to the second \nhighest court in the land, would not answer that question.\n  I asked: Which Federal court judge, living or dead, would you emulate \nor admire on the bench? He went on to say, first, that he could not \nname a single Federal court judge, living or dead, he would try to \nemulate on the bench.\n  He then, in later response to the same question, said: I admire some \nof the Federal Court Justices I have worked with. I can understand \nthat. That is a reasonable response.\n  But do you understand how we, sitting on this side of the table, are \nsaying how can this man, who is clearly a gifted individual with \nextraordinary legal talent, be so afraid to share with us one Supreme \nCourt case that he disagrees with?\n  That was a question Senator Sessions asked of Richard Paez, and I \ndon't believe a Democrat stood up and said: That is not fair. You have \ngone too far.\n  It is a reasonable question. It gives you insight. Is he going to \nmention Brown v. Board of Education? Is he going to mention Roe v. \nWade? What case is he going to mention? He wouldn't mention one. \nDoesn't that trouble you? I ask my colleague and friend, doesn't that \ntrouble you, that someone who is seeking that kind of legal appointment \nwouldn't be honest and candid with you? For the sake of yielding to my \ncolleague for a question\n\n[[Page S2759]]\n\nand for him to answer my question, I will yield.\n  Mr. CRAPO. I will respond and ask a question, how is that?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Sure.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Not having sat in the hearing, I don't know how much it \nwould trouble me. I can't tell you if a witness would not answer my \nquestions I wouldn't be troubled by it. I don't think that would cause \nme to try to filibuster the nomination, which is really one of the core \nissues we are dealing with here. I might vote no because of it. And you \nare perfectly entitled to vote no if you don't like the answers to your \nquestions. But we are way beyond not liking the answers to questions \nhere. We are seeing a filibuster of a nomination to the Circuit Court \nof Appeals for the District of Columbia. It is based, as I understand \nit, in large part on the fact that confidential documents are not \ndisclosed.\n  What I am trying to get at is: What else? What I have heard at this \npoint is the nominee did not identify which was his favorite and least \nfavorite Supreme Court case, and that he would not say how he would \nhave judged a particular case until he had read the briefs and studied \nthe matter more carefully. Frankly, I think that makes him a better \ncandidate.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am sorry, I am going to have to interject at that \npoint. We didn't ask him how he would rule on a particular case. We \nasked him, on deciding cases, to explain his position on an accepted \nstandard of law. We could not and should not and I don't think any \nMember would ask him how he would rule on a specific case pending \nbefore the Court. That is way beyond the bounds.\n  Let me just say, though, this is an interesting thing on which I \nthink my colleague might reflect. This comes from the Legal Times of \nApril 2002. It's a quote:\n\n       President George W. Bush's judicial nominees received some \n     very specific confirmation advice last week: Keep your mouth \n     shut. Justice Scalia called DC Circuit Judge Silberman at one \n     point, the latter recalled, and told him he was about to be \n     questioned about his views about Marbury v. Madison, the \n     nearly 200-year-old case that established the principle of \n     judicial review.\n\n  That's almost the first case--McCulloch v. Maryland and Marbury v. \nMadison--the first two cases you'll ever read in constitutional law. \nListen to what Silberman told him.\n\n       ``I told him as a matter of principle he should not answer \n     that question either,'' Silberman said.\n\n  So you understand we are not just dealing with my interpretation as \nto whether or not Miguel Estrada is cooperative; we are dealing with a \nstrategy: Keep your mouth shut. Don't tell the Senate, don't tell the \nAmerican people, don't put on the record who you are and what you \nbelieve. Zip your mouth, hold tight, wait for the vote, and we will \ngive you a lifetime appointment to the second highest court of the \nland. I don't think that is a fair way to approach this process.\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. After I finish. When the Clinton nominees came before the \nJudiciary Committee under the control of the Republicans, they were \npeppered with questions. Some of those questions I think went way \nbeyond the realm of reasonable inquiry.\n  I can recall one woman from California who was asked to explain how \nshe had voted on every proposition before the California voters over \nthe previous 10 years; in other words, to disclose the secrecy of the \nballot place, how she had voted and why on every proposition. That was \na question propounded by a Republican Senator from the Judiciary \nCommittee, still serving there, to this Clinton nominee. She said that \nis unfair, and we agreed with her. Because of that stance she took, she \nwaited forever and ever to be confirmed.\n  In this situation I think what we are dealing with is a reasonable \ninquiry--positions on Supreme Court Justices, Supreme Court cases. We \nare not asking for Miguel Estrada to disclose his personal conscience \nand feelings on issues that may be of some personal note to him, but, \nrather, to focus on his view of the law. I think that is reasonable. I \nhope we will continue in our efforts to do that.\n  I might say to the Senator, I am going to move to another topic. If \nhe is interested in staying, of course, he might.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Will the Senator entertain one more question before he \nmoves on? I do appreciate him allowing me to engage in this discussion \nwith him.\n  Again, I am trying to make it clear so we understand just exactly \nwhat it is that is being said Miguel Estrada has not disclosed. We \ntalked about the documents in the Solicitor General's Office that he \nprepared as a career attorney. We talked about his failure to identify \nwhich was his favorite and least favorite Supreme Court case. And \napparently--I was not at the hearing because I don't sit on the \nJudiciary Committee--he did not answer Senator Kennedy's questions \nabout some current cases to the satisfaction of the Senators.\n  Is there anything else that is holding him back? Again, the reason I \nam getting at this is because we are facing a remarkably unique \ncircumstance here, the filibuster of a circuit court nomination on the \nbasis of nondisclosure. I want to get out exactly what that \nnondisclosure is so we and the American public can understand that. \nThen we can deal with it on a very focused basis, on a point-by-point \nbasis and, where there is merit on either side, deal with it.\n  But the general charges, it seems to me, of nondisclosure and not \nanswering questions to the satisfaction of a Senator usually result in \na Senator saying I don't like the way the answers were given so I am \ngoing to vote no on the nomination. Instead, at this point we are \nfacing a filibuster, which I believe is a serious threat to the manner \nand the protocol with which the Senate has approached Presidential \nnominations to the judiciary and is much broader than just the \nnomination of this individual judge.\n  So we have two issues which to me are much broader than this specific \nnomination. The first is whether we should have the Senate start \ninquiries into confidential Solicitor General documents, and the second \nis whether the Senate should be stopped from voting on a Presidential \nnomination by a filibuster when we are dealing with nominations to the \njudiciary. That will change the way this Senate has operated \nhistorically.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Let me just say to my colleague, I have given him great \nleeway in his questioning.\n  Mr. CRAPO. You have.\n  Mr. DURBIN. And for specific reason. I thank him for coming to the \nfloor, even though we disagree on this issue. This deliberative body \ndoesn't deliberate much. There is not much debate on the floor of the \nSenate and that is sad. I thank him for coming to the floor and for \nengaging me in questions. I think he will find, almost without \nexception, I always yield for questions because I happen to believe \nthat is what this is about. It is a deliberative body. We should \nexpress our points of view. Let our colleagues and those following \ndebate decide who is right and who is wrong. I thank him for asking \nthose questions.\n  I think what he has said is he has a difference of opinion from my \npoint of view on the disclosure of documents. That is an honest \ndifference. I think what I have said is in the past there has been \ndisclosure, lines have been drawn, but in this case the White House \nsaid no disclosure when it comes to Miguel Estrada's documents, and \nthat is an important issue before us.\n  Second, he has asked for a bill of particulars: Give us the specific \nquestions that you didn't like when it came to Miguel Estrada's \nresponses. I have given him several. That is not an exclusive or \nexhaustive list. I think other members of the Judiciary Committee could \ncome up with more.\n  If the Senator is suggesting we should resubmit the questions and see \nif he takes the test a second time whether he can pass it, maybe that \nwould move us down the road a little closer to a final vote on this \nindividual.\n  I want to add here it is unusual for there to be a filibuster on a \nnominee to such an important bench, but it is not unprecedented. I \ndon't know if my colleague was in the Senate when the Richard Paez \nnomination came before us. But the fact is, he would not have been \nconfirmed had it not been for a cloture vote that had to be filed. \nPaez, who waited patiently for over 4 years before the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, finally had to have a cloture vote in which he prevailed to \nbecome a Federal judge.\n\n[[Page S2760]]\n\n  The Republicans, then in a position to launch a filibuster, did it on \na Hispanic nominee not that long ago, in March of 2000. We know when it \ncame to Richard Paez, the standard used by many Republican Senators was \nwe will filibuster him. It took a cloture vote to stop the filibuster. \nI don't know if the Senator was in the Senate at that time. I think he \nwas. I do not know how he voted. But the fact is some Members felt \nstrongly enough about the Paez nomination that they went ahead and \ninitiated this kind of filibuster.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. President, I would like to move on to another issue if I can. It \nis one I think bears some attention by the Senate and those following \nthe deliberation. We are now in the third week of debating Miguel \nEstrada. It is an important issue.\n  Today, I noticed when President Bush spoke to the Latino Coalition in \nthe Executive Office Building, the first issue he raised was not Miguel \nEstrada but it was an important issue--and I am sure he did that for \nemphasis--but when it came to the issues raised by the President of the \nUnited States to the Latino Coalition in the Executive Office Building, \nthe first issue he raised was the state of the economy. It is \ninteresting to me that though the President raised this issue, we can't \nraise this issue on the floor of the Senate.\n  Yesterday, the minority leader, Tom Daschle, made a unanimous consent \nrequest which I am going to repeat in a few moments that we move from \nthis debate to a debate on the state of the economy--and I think for \ngood reason.\n  As you look across America, you think people will realize our economy \nis in a sad state. This is a recession which has gone on entirely too \nlong. My friends on the Republican side say this is a Clinton \nrecession. I am afraid the statute of limitations has run on that \nparticular complaint.\n  At this point in time, 2.5 million jobs have been lost since \nPresident Bush took office. He is going to have to take ownership for \nthis recession.\n  There are many factors which led to this recession. There is no doubt \nthe economy heated up prior to his coming into office, and there was \ngoing to be a correction. There is no doubt as well that terrorism and \n9/11 took its toll on the economy, and continue to, I might add.\n  There is also no doubt that the economic policy pursued by the Bush \ntax cut 2 years ago failed. It didn't work. We continue to lose jobs by \nthe cut in interest rates to try to get the economy moving forward \nagain. Frankly, we are in a terrible situation. We understand our \neconomy needs a boost. Consumer confidence in America is at a 10-year \nlow. It was reported yesterday that the Consumer Confidence Index \nplummeted from 4.6 to the revised 7.8, this the lowest reading since \nOctober of 1993.\n  Unemployment is on the rise. Since January 2000, the number of \nunemployed increased by nearly 40 percent with nearly 8.3 million \nAmericans out of work, and 2.3 million private sector jobs lost.\n  Contrast that with the Clinton administration where 22 million jobs \nwere created. In the Bush administration of 2 years and a few months, \n10 percent of those jobs have been lost--a 2.3 million increase in the \ncreation of jobs. What we have in the Bush administration is the \nelimination of jobs which were previously created by the Clinton \nadministration.\n  Unemployment spells are lengthening because companies are not hiring. \nIt isn't a problem of losing a job today and finding another one next \nmonth. The average number of weeks individuals spend unsuccessfully \nseeking work increased by a month over the past year. Approximately 20 \npercent of all the unemployed have been looking for work for more than \n6 months. Wage growth is now stagnant. The shortage of jobs has \nslowed--I might add, as has the increase in the cost of health \ninsurance, another issue which this administration summarily ignores.\n  Today, President Bush spoke to the Latino Coalition about small \nbusinesses and what we need to do to help small businesses. Instead of \na tax plan that will help small businesses, let me suggest as follows. \nWhat the Bush tax plan offers to the wealthiest individuals in America \nis a three-layered cake. What the Bush tax plan offers to small \nbusiness is crumbs; things that, frankly, are not controversial in \nterms of expensing. But the vast majority of the tax cut the President \nis pushing will not stimulate today's economy, but it will burrow us \ndeep into a deficit which, frankly, is not fair. The fact is they are \ngiving tax breaks to the wealthy people.\n\n  The President failed to mention what I would suggest would be the top \none or two complaints of small businesses in America today. You pick \nthem. Open the phone books and call a small business person and ask, \nWhat is your problem today? They will say the economy is not strong. \nPeople aren't buying. What about your expenses in business? What kind \nof problems do you face? I guarantee you the answer will be the cost of \nhealth insurance. And not a word, not one word from the Bush \nadministration about how to deal with that.\n  I introduced a bill to give a tax credit to small businesses which \nwould allow them to provide health insurance for their employees. It \ndoesn't answer the problem. But at least it is sensitive to trying to \nhelp small employers employ their people as well as the owners of the \nbusiness dealing with health insurance protection. That, to me, is a \nreasonable approach, and something that would help small businesses, \nwhich is summarily ignored by the Bush administration.\n  The track record we have now for job creation is the worst in 58 \nyears. In order for the Bush administration to tie the Eisenhower \nadministration for the worst job creation record ever, President Bush \nwould have to create 96,000 jobs a month starting today to the end of \nhis term. He is not going to get that done, I am afraid. I hope I am \nwrong. I hope the economy turns around.\n  But isn't it interesting, with the economy in a basket struggling to \nsurvive, that we can't even engage in a debate on the floor of the \nSenate about what steps we can take to get this economy back on track. \nI don't have to tell you about the crisis most States are facing when \nit comes to their budgets. Illinois will have about a $5 billion \ndeficit which the Governor is going to have to wrestle with under \nextraordinary circumstances. He will have to cut spending, I am sure. \nThere are some who will say he should raise taxes. Whatever he does \nwill not help us move out after a recession. In fact, it puts a damper \non economic growth at a time when we should be putting stimulus. So \nthat situation is out there as well.\n  I might also add that the situation when it comes to homeland \nsecurity is also a damper on the economy. So many business people \nacross America are worried about their vulnerabilities when it comes to \nthe economy. They hope this government, starting in Washington, will \nprovide a helping hand. But it hasn't happened, because this \nadministration has been strong on rhetoric and press conferences, but \nweak when it comes to providing the money so that State and local \nresources can be increased and enhanced.\n  Who are you going to call if there is a threat of terrorism in the \ncommunity? Are you going to ask for a telephone number for 1600 \nPennsylvania Avenue to try to get through to President Bush or Vice \nPresident Chaney? Not likely. You are likely to call 9-1-1 and a local \npoliceman or firefighter is going to be the voice at the other end of \nthe call. If they are not trained, if they are not equipped, frankly, \nhomeland security is a farce.\n  We know what is going on in the Middle East today. Troops numbering \n180,000 have been sent by our government--military personnel and \nsupport personnel--in preparation for the invasion of Iraq. It is clear \nthat America is preparing to attack. But we know from the homeland \nsecurity side that America is not prepared to defend. We are not \nprepared to defend the hometown families and neighborhoods and \ncommunities across America. This administration has not come up with \nthe resources we need to make that happen.\n  At this point, I would like to introduce into the Record--it probably \nhas been done before, but it certainly bears repeating--a letter sent \nto President Bush by my friend and colleague, and ranking Member of the \nSenate Committee on Appropriations, Senator\n\n[[Page S2761]]\n\nRobert C. Byrd of West Virginia. The letter is dated February 23, 2003. \nThe reason I want to enter it at this point is that Senator Byrd goes \nthrough chapter and verse of the take by Democrats in Congress and \nCongress in general to persuade the Bush administration to put more \nmoney into homeland security. He spells out in graphic detail how this \nWhite House has stopped our efforts every step of the way. It is a sad \nreality that as we face terrorists at home we are not providing the \nresources that are necessary to the local first responders.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Appropriations,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 25, 2003.\n     Hon. George W. Bush,\n     Office of the President, The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: In your remarks to the National \n     Governors Association on February 24, 2003, you claimed that \n     Congress was to blame for a reduction in homeland security \n     funding in Fiscal Year 2003. Such a claim is wrong, and I \n     urge you to correct it.\n       If enacted, the Administration's Fiscal Year 2003 request \n     for first responders, for instance, would have eliminated \n     funding for the Justice Department's Office of Domestic \n     Preparedness; it would have eliminated funding for the \n     Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) hiring \n     initiative; it would have discarded the Edward Byrne Memorial \n     and the Local Law Enforcement Assistance Block grant \n     programs; and it would have provided absolutely no support \n     for the Assistance to Firefighters grant program.\n       A lack of Administration commitment to first responders is \n     just the beginning of the empty rhetoric coming from the \n     White House on homeland security funding.\n       Since September 11, 2001, you have signed, with great \n     fanfare, legislation to authorize improvements in airport, \n     seaport, and border security. Yet, your Administration has \n     opposed efforts to fund those bills. On December 10, 2002, \n     you announced a plan for state and local governments to \n     vaccinate 10 million first responders for a potential \n     smallpox attack. But your Administration has passed the \n     responsibility of paying for these vaccines to the state and \n     local governments.\n       Last August, you rejected $2.5 billion that Congress, in an \n     overwhelming bipartisan fashion, approved for homeland \n     security efforts. Congress had designated those funds as \n     emergency priorities in the Fiscal Year 2002 Supplemental \n     Appropriations bill. This package include funds to begin to \n     meet the billions of dollars of outstanding applications from \n     18,000 fire departments for equipment and training. The \n     legislation also included grant funding to make police and \n     fire equipment interoperable--a critical weakness in response \n     efforts on September 11, 2001. The homeland security package \n     contained critical funding for port security, for security \n     enhancements at small and medium airports, and for federal \n     law enforcement counterterrorism efforts. The legislation \n     included funding to strengthen security at nuclear plants \n     and laboratories and to protect the nation's food and \n     water supply.\n       Instead of embracing this package and agreeing with \n     Congress on its urgency, you called it wasteful. It only took \n     your signature to address these vulnerabilities, but you \n     refused and called the funding wasteful.\n       I must note that the Senate Appropriations Committee \n     approved that funding unanimously. In fact, the Committee \n     last July approved each of the 13 appropriations bills on a \n     unanimous, bipartisan basis. But your Administration objected \n     again and again to these bills despite the overwhelming needs \n     facing the nation.\n       This past January, during Senate consideration of the \n     Fiscal Year 2003 Omnibus Appropriations bill, I offered two \n     amendments, both aimed at increasing investments in homeland \n     security initiatives from coast to coast. The amendments \n     focused on funding authorization bills that you signed with \n     great fanfare. But again the Administration said the funds \n     were unnecessary and urged the Senate to reject these \n     amendments. The political strong-arm tactics worked, and the \n     amendments were rejected to partisan votes (roll call votes \n     #002 and #003).\n       Last spring, the Senate Appropriations Committee held five \n     days of hearings to examine homeland security priorities. The \n     Administration was represented by six Cabinet secretaries, \n     the Attorney General, and the Director of the Federal \n     Emergency Management Agency. They argued the case for \n     homeland security funding plan. However, every local \n     government representative and every representative of fire, \n     police, and emergency response agencies testified that the \n     Administration's funding plan was seriously flawed. They \n     testified that doing away with the funding programs which \n     have proved so valuable was shortsighted and irresponsible.\n       In your remarks to the governors, you characterized the \n     Congress's decision to use existing and effective programs to \n     deliver funding to our first responders as micromanagement. \n     Congress chose to fully fund your $3.5 billion first \n     responder request through existing, effective channels rather \n     than launch a new, untested program. This was a responsible \n     decision.\n       In the Fiscal Year 2003 appropriations legislation, \n     Congress chose to be responsible by listening to the men and \n     women on the front lines of homeland security. We heard their \n     needs and answered their calls for help. But, time and time \n     again, the Administration has turned its back to the nation's \n     first responders. Enough is enough.\n       I appreciate your desire to protect the nation from \n     terrorist attack, but the job cannot be accomplished with \n     continued political grandstanding. The country needs an \n     Administration that takes an honest approach to homeland \n     security instead of continually making empty promises to the \n     nation's police, fire, and emergency medical teams. The \n     American people want to know that if there is an attack close \n     to their homes, their local doctors and nurses have the \n     training to treat the injured. They want to know that their \n     local firemen have the ability and equipment to handle a \n     chemical or biological attack. They want to know that their \n     local police officers are trained in identifying and \n     responding to the variety of terrorist attacks that we now \n     could face.\n       The enemy is not Congress, Mr. President. The enemy is the \n     terrorist who stands ready to exploit the nation's many \n     security gaps. Especially now, when the terror alert is high \n     and war is looming at our doorstep, we must be acutely aware \n     of the sharply increased threat of attack here at home. \n     Instead of pointing fingers and assigning blame, I implore \n     you to expedite the release of the homeland security funds in \n     the Fiscal Year 2003 appropriations legislation and the funds \n     that still are unobligated from the Fiscal Year 2002 \n     appropriations bills. The fact that these dollars, approved \n     by Congress in December 2001, sit idle is beyond \n     comprehension. I also hope that you consider expanding the \n     investment in homeland security in the upcoming supplemental \n     bill. As a nation, we know where our vulnerabilities lie, and \n     we can be sure that the terrorists do, as well. We should \n     take every step possible to protect the American people and \n     to provide critical funding for homeland security \n     initiatives.\n       As we move forward, I urge you to work with Congress in a \n     bipartisan fashion to provide homeland security funding will \n     make a significant investment in the protection of the \n     American people.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                   Robert C. Byrd.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate very much the Senator entering that letter \nfrom Senator Byrd.\n  I ask the Senator from Illinois: Is he aware that the reason Senator \nByrd wrote that letter is because President Bush, at the signing of the \nomnibus bill when we lumped 11 appropriations bills--is the Senator \naware that he had the audacity to say at the signing of that bill that \nit was OK, but he was upset with Congress for not providing more money \nfor homeland security? Is the Senator aware that is why Senator Byrd \nwrote that letter, because it is just not true?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes. I am aware of it. It is sadly troubling, because \nwhat the President did in making that statement is to mischaracterize \nwhat happened.\n  The Senator may recall, as I do, that Senator Byrd came before this \nbody early on and said to us we have a problem in America. If we are \ngoing to protect America, we need to make a substantial investment in \nchanges such as a statewide communications system for Nevada and \nIllinois so the police, fire, and medical responders can all be on the \nsame network if there is terrorist activity or a disaster. These \ninvestments are basic. And also in the area of bioterrorism, to make \nsure that doctors, nurses, and health care personnel are adequately \ntrained and that hospitals are ready if there is anthrax, God forbid, \nas we faced on Capitol Hill.\n\n  Senator Byrd came time and time again to this floor and begged us, as \na nation, to be responsive. Unfortunately, time and time again, he was \nrejected.\n  When we finally sent a $2.5 billion amount to the White House, asking \nthem to put that into homeland security, it was effectively vetoed--\n$2.5 billion stopped. So the President cannot point the finger at \nCongress.\n  I say to my friend from Nevada, I am anxious to follow the debate we \nare going to face in a few weeks when we have this administration come \nbefore us and tell us they need $26 billion for Turkey--$6 billion in \ngrants and $20 billion in loan guarantees for Turkey--which has been \ntheir demand if we are going to be using Turkey as a base of operations \nfor an invasion of Iraq.\n\n[[Page S2762]]\n\n  I want the administration to explain to the American people how we \ncan afford $26 billion for the defense and security of Turkey and \ncannot afford $2 billion for the defense and security of the United \nStates of America when it comes to homeland security. That is going to \nbe an interesting debate.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield for another question.\n  Mr. REID. Is the Senator aware that one of the reasons Senator Byrd \nwas so upset--and that is probably too calm a term for how he reacted \nto this statement of the President. Senator Byrd, you will recall, when \nhe was chairman of the Appropriations Committee, last year, held a \nseries of hearings that went over 2 weeks, where we called in various \nadministration officials, people from communities in States around the \ncountry, to find out what their needs were for homeland security. That \nis why he brought the money number before the Congress. And he was \nrejected by the President.\n  Is the Senator aware of that?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am not only aware of it, I attended many of those \nhearings, as I believe the Senator from Nevada did as well. And Senator \nByrd took it very seriously. He brought in the experts when it came to \nlaw enforcement, fire protection, and medical personnel, and asked them \nwhat they needed. It was not this porkbarrel that we are often accused \nof here and of dreaming up ideas on how to spend money.\n  He asked the people on the ground: What do you need? What will help? \nWhen they identified those needs, he put that into legislation, which \nwas rejected by this administration.\n  So we have a situation, if you would step back for a second, where we \nhave an economy on the ropes. We have a President with a failed \neconomic policy. We have a war on terrorism, which continues to pursue \nOsama bin Laden, with very little success. We have a homeland security \nprogram headed up by a man we both respect, Tom Ridge, which, \nunfortunately, is not sending the resources necessary to State and \nlocal governments so they can protect America.\n  Instead, we are preparing to launch an invasion of Iraq. We are \nputting the billions of dollars necessary into that effort and, \nunfortunately, shortchanging homeland security in the process. That, to \nme, shows misguided priorities.\n  The President cannot get away with blaming Congress for this. It \nreally is a creation of his own administration and their own priorities \nin spending.\n  Mr. REID. I have three questions I wish to ask the Senator. Will the \nSenator yield for the first question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. I had in my office yesterday--and I am wondering if the \nSenator had people from Illinois in his office recently--people who \ncame from Nevada and represented 911 centers, especially the Las Vegas \nMetropolitan Police Department, which is a very large police \ndepartment. I spoke to a woman who has worked there for 20 years. She \nproceeded to tell me that she is frightened for the people of Clark \nCounty. That is in the Las Vegas metropolitan area. If someone calls on \na regular telephone from their home, they know where that call is \ncoming from.\n  But a lot of people--because computer use has become so prevalent, \nand they are using computers for telephones, and because of the use of \ncell phones--if someone calls from a computer or cell phone to 911, \nthey have no idea where, or who, or anything about that. It is a \nterrible tragedy for the American people.\n  Is the Senator aware that is something that money for homeland \nsecurity would identify because the technology is there, they just need \nmoney to be able to do it?\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator's point is well taken because I visited the \n911 center in Chicago. It is really state of the art. But there are \ngaps that they face as well. They need the funding for training, for \nimproving the communications network, money that is not forthcoming \nfrom this administration, from this White House.\n  I pray to God we never face another terrorist event in America. But \nif we do, this administration will be held accountable as to whether it \nspent the money, when it should have, to prepare America to defend \nitself. And when it comes to this kind of communication effort, I am \nafraid we have not done that.\n  Mr. REID. I listened to the Senator outline, as he is so adept at \ndoing, the situation we have in the American economy today, with 2 \nmillion people unemployed. The Senator has laid out a very good picture \nof what we have going on in America today.\n  Is the Senator aware of the nonpartisan organization called the Pew \nResearch Center? Is the Senator aware of that organization?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes, I am.\n  Mr. REID. I ask, is the Senator aware they conducted a poll, which \nwas completed on February 18, of 1,254 adults? Is the Senator aware \nthat when asked the question on how President Bush is handling the \neconomy, 43 percent of the people said yes, he is doing fine, but that \n48 percent of the people asked that question disapproved? Is the \nSenator aware of those numbers?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I heard those numbers when the Senator from Nevada \nmentioned them earlier. But I think reality has caught up with the \nadministration. Generally, Americans give the President high marks as a \nPresident. And the numbers have come down, but only slightly. His \ngeneral overall rating is positive. I think a lot of that reflects on \nhis leadership since 911 and perhaps in the Middle East. But when asked \nspecifically about the state of the economy, that is when the chickens \ncome home to roost.\n  I think that is the point where the President and the White House is \nfailing. They have failed because their economic policy--giving tax \ncuts to the wealthiest people in America, generating the biggest \ndeficits in our history--really has us headed down the road which we \nall understand would be a road of economic ruin.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. REID. Is the Senator aware that this same poll asked how \nPresident Bush is handling tax policy? The Senator has made a number of \nstatements on this floor, and he personally disagrees with the tax \npolicy enunciated by this President. I am happy to report, from this \npoll, people in America agree with the Senator and not the President.\n  Is the Senator aware that 42 percent of the people approve of the way \nGeorge W. Bush is handling tax policy, and 44 percent disapprove? Is \nthe Senator aware of that?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I had not heard those numbers before, but I think I can \nunderstand why the American people reached that conclusion. Because the \nPresident promised the age-old Republican response: If you just cut \ntaxes on the wealthiest people in America, it is bound to enliven and \nenergize the economy. Well, he did it. I voted no when it came to that \nissue. But it passed. It did not work. What happened was we wound up \nwith a deficit and a weaker economy.\n  So the Bush tax plan failed in the first instance. Now the President \nhas said: I have a new economic policy, and it is called: More of the \nsame; let's try to do this, and do it at even greater levels, which \nwill drag us more deeply into deficit.\n  I would like to illustrate this point to the Senator from Nevada by \nshowing him a couple charts, if I can find them.\n  President Bush, on January 29, 2002, in his State of the Union \nAddress, was quoted as saying:\n\n       Our budget will run a deficit that will be [a] small and \n     short term [deficit.]\n\n  Then, take a look at what this means. We are going to have record \ndeficits in terms of the Bush administration, the legacy that is going \nto be left from the President. The actual deficits, which our children \nwill have to pay, are going to break records.\n  Isn't it interesting that the Republicans, who have fashioned \nthemselves as fiscal conservatives, now find themselves, once again, in \na posture of creating the biggest deficits in the history of the United \nStates--harkening back to President Ronald Reagan's administration?\n  But if you take a look at the surpluses, which we thought we would \nenjoy for a long time to come, they started with $236 billion to $127 \nbillion. We are paying down the debt in the Social Security trust fund. \nAnd then it falls off the table.\n\n[[Page S2763]]\n\n  In comes the George Bush tax plan, and the state of the economy, and \nthe recession, and look at these deficits start to grow--in the range \nof $300 billion plus. The administration just gives the back of the \nhand to those deficits and says they are not really long-term problems.\n  They are long-term problems because they have to be repaid. And it \ndoes not show the kind of discipline, in which we should be engaged. \nThe tax plan proposed by the President is a plan which, sadly, is going \nto plunge the United States more deeply into deficit and is not going \nto revive the economy.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will yield for one last question. I see another \ncolleague is in the Chamber.\n\n  Mr. REID. I actually have two questions. I know the Senator is \nanxious to leave.\n  I will first lay the basis for my question. The numbers the Senator \nhas on that chart are basically inaccurate to the effect that it does \nnot include the disguise that is taking place down at Pennsylvania \nAvenue, because Social Security surpluses are there to dampen the \namount of the deficit. Actually, the deficit is about $485 billion, not \n$304 billion, because the Social Security surpluses are being used to \ndisguise the budget.\n  Is the Senator aware of that?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am aware of that. I think it is a good point to be \nmade. These true deficits are at the expense of the Social Security \ntrust fund. In the closing years of the Clinton administration, \nsurpluses that we generated were paying off the debt of the Social \nSecurity trust fund, making it a stronger program for years to come, as \nbaby boomers will arrive and ask for benefits.\n  Now, in the Bush administration, with tax cuts for the wealthiest \npeople in America, we are raiding the Social Security trust fund and \nweakening it at a time when we know we need it the most.\n  Mr. REID. Last question. The Senator has spoken about the need for us \nto be doing something other than just talking about a man who is fully \nemployed, in contrast to the 2.8 million people who have lost jobs \nunder this administration. The man we are debating now has a job \ndowntown where he makes lots of money. We should be doing something \nelse. The Senator, I am sure, is not aware of this statement because it \nwas made during the noon hour and he has been on the floor. I would \nlike the Senator to tell me if he is familiar with Robert Novak.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes. He is an Illinois resident, who grew up in Joliet. I \nhave been on ``Crossfire'' with him many times.\n  Mr. REID. Bob Novak said today:\n\n       Well, the Republicans figured that they would be home at \n     their recess last week and find out what the people wanted. \n     Apparently, the people weren't interested in Estrada, because \n     the Republicans have no idea what to do in the Senate. They \n     had a leadership meeting yesterday afternoon [that was \n     Tuesday] couldn't figure anything out, had a luncheon of all \n     the Republican senators, didn't figure it out. All that's \n     decided is, they're not going to ask for a cloture vote to \n     force an end to the filibuster, because they'd lose that. But \n     they have no strategy for around-the-clock sessions. They \n     don't know what to do. The Democrats are winning.\n\n  So that former resident of the State of Illinois said this, and would \nthe Senator agree with him?\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator is putting me on the spot to agree with Bob \nNovak. I will not question his conclusion, unless the Senator on that \nside would like to correct the record. That is the problem faced by the \nRepublican caucus.\n  I say to the Senator from Nevada that I am prepared to deliver them \nfrom their plight. I am prepared to give them hope and direction. I am \ngoing to make a unanimous consent request that we stop this debate \nright now and move immediately to the consideration of an economic \nstimulus package and that we engage all of the Senators, Democrats and \nRepublicans, to come to the floor and talk about what we can do to turn \nthe economy around, create jobs, create consumer confidence, give \nbusinesses some hope, try to find some way to put Americans back to \nwork.\n  Let's stop talking about Miguel Estrada, who has a good job downtown \nfor a law firm, and start talking about the millions of Americans who \nare worried about their jobs and whether they will have them in the \nfuture.\n  When I make the unanimous consent request, if there is no objection, \nI say to those following the debate, we will move directly to the \neconomic stimulus package. In that debate, perhaps by the end of the \nweek, we can come up with something that shows that the Senate cares, \nthat this Congress cares about the state of the economy.\n  Now, if by chance a Republican Senator stands up and objects to my \nunanimous consent request, that Senator is saying that he does not want \nus to talk about the economy, doesn't want us to talk about economic \nstimulus; he wants us to stay mired down in one judicial nomination for \nthe remainder of this week. I cannot believe any Republican Senator \nwould object to this unanimous consent request, which I will make now. \nI believe it is going to finally move us away from this judicial \nnomination to the issue people care about across America, getting this \neconomy moving.\n\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nlegislative session and begin the consideration of Calendar No. 21, S. \n414, a bill to provide an economic stimulus package for America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, reserving the right to object. I will not \nobject if the request for unanimous consent is amended to provide that \nprior to moving to the legislative calendar, the Senate move no later \nthan 6 p.m. today to a vote on the Estrada nomination, up or down, and \nthen proceed to the legislative calendar under the consideration of \nboth the Republican and Democratic plans.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to modify the \nrequest of the distinguished junior Senator from Idaho, that his \nrequest be changed to that the vote on Estrada would occur only after \nthe memos from the Solicitor General's Office are provided to us, and \nthat following that, he submits himself to questioning.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, I will not accept that modification to my \nrequest.\n  Mr. REID. I object to his request.\n  Mr. CRAPO. I object to the previous request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, there you have it. I tried my best to \nmove this debate away from one man, one nomination, to the state of the \neconomy.\n  Basically, what the Senator has said is that unless we can have this \none nominee, we don't care about the economy; let it languish, falter, \nand let the American people lose hope. We are going to stick with this \none political issue.\n  I think there is a way out of this morass with Miguel Estrada. I \nthink we can do it cooperatively, with the production of documents and \nthe honest answering of questions. I don't think we should delay the \nbusiness of the Senate indefinitely and ignore the serious problems \nfacing our Nation in the process. I hope there will be some \nreconsideration of the issue.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, it seems to me that we can easily move to \nany of these other issues that the Senator and his colleagues have been \ndiscussing, which we all agree need to be addressed. We can easily move \nthere if your side will agree to give up trying to stop the nomination \nof this one single judge.\n  So one could say that those who want to hold the floor and focus on \nthis nomination are willing to delay debate of other issues until we \nvote on this particular nomination, or that those who are \nfilibustering--which is generally understood by the public as an act of \nstopping a procedure and moving to a vote--this particular nomination \nare unwilling to move to these other economic issues.\n  Would you not agree that it really comes down to the question of \nwhether we want to agree to change the precedent of the Senate and open \nup investigation into these confidential documents of the Solicitor \nGeneral's Office?\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will say to my friend, we have talked about this at \nlength. I\n\n[[Page S2764]]\n\nbelieve it is unprecedented. We are asking for the writings of Mr. \nEstrada so we may know who he is. I don't think that is unreasonable.\n  There are three conceivable outcomes of the nomination. One is that \nthere be a cloture vote called for by Senator Frist to try to bring an \nend to this debate on the floor. That is his right.\n  As I noted, there was a cloture vote called on Richard Paez, a \nHispanic nominee of the Clinton administration. So it has happened \nbefore.\n  There could be a decision by Senator Frist to move this nomination \nback to the calendar. I think the best outcome would be that, finally, \nMiguel Estrada would be open, candid, honest, and not conceal what he \ntruly believes about the state of law in America. If he is seeking a \nlifetime appointment to the second highest court of the land, that is \nthe least we can ask of him.\n  Those are the potential outcomes. What I tried to do was circumvent \neven those three and say let's move to the economy, and maybe at some \nlater time move back to Miguel Estrada. But the Senator said, no, we \ndon't want to talk about the economic situation in America, about \nunemployment, about job loss and loss of consumer confidence, the \nbiggest deficits in the history of the United States. We just want to \ntalk about one judicial nomination. That is unfortunate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n\n\n                             A Safer World\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, regarding this debate on Miguel Estrada, \nwe do have a lot of other issues that seem to be ignored. I am back \nhome almost every week in Vermont and I don't find anybody talking to \nme about Miguel Estrada. Even when the White House has sent people up \nand various special interest groups to attack me, nobody seems to \ncare--``either the press, the people in my State,'' or anybody else. \nBut what they do care very much about is the economy and Iraq.\n  More than a half century ago in the aftermath of two catastrophic \nworld wars, the United Nations Charter was signed in San Francisco. It \nwas dedicated to the prevention and peaceful resolution of conflict. \nThe U.N. was largely a creation of the United States, with the support \nof the other great world powers.\n  The U.N. has had a difficult history. With the notable exception of \nthe Korean war, the Soviet Union and the United States each worked \nthroughout the Cold War to ensure that the U.N. Security Council \nremained little more than a toothless forum for debating and passing \nresolutions of little or no effect.\n  Even in recent years, the United Nations has had a string of \nfailures. It was unable to prevent the slaughter of half a million \npeople in Rwanda. It failed to prevent the destruction of the former \nYugoslavia, which was ultimately stopped only by NATO's intervention. \nUnited Nations resolutions seeking to resolve the Israeli--Palestinian \nconflict have been routinely ignored.\n  The United Nations has also passed resolutions aimed at eliminating \nIraq's nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons programs, but the \nIraqi Government has flagrantly tried to subvert those resolutions.\n  The United Nations is frequently blamed for these failures. It is \nconvenient to ridicule a multilateral organization that often seems to \nbe its own worst enemy. But there are also many examples of U.N. \nsuccesses, like peacekeeping missions that are strongly supported by \nthe United States but rarely involve any commitment of U.S. troops.\n  The U.N.'s effectiveness depends on the political--will or lack of \nwill--of its 191 member states. No country--no country--bears more \nresponsibility than the United States for the success or failure of the \nUnited Nations. This has never been more true than today when solving \nso many of the world's problems--especially combating terrorism--depend \non U.S. leadership and the cooperation of other nations.\n  Not surprisingly, when it has served its interests, this \nadministration has praised the United Nations and has urged the \nCongress to provide the funds to support it. In fact, a Bush \nadministration publication states:\n\n       Acting through the United Nations allows the United States \n     to share the risks and costs of responding to international \n     crises.\n\n  I applauded President Bush when he went to the United Nations last \nSeptember to seek a resolution calling for the return of U.N. weapons \ninspectors to Iraq. I and others here had urged him to take that step, \nat a time when many of the President's advisers were insisting that a \nresolution was both unnecessary and unwise.\n  And I commended Secretary Powell for recognizing the importance of \nsecuring United Nations support for disarming Iraq, and for his work in \nobtaining a unanimous vote of the U.N. Security Council for that \nresolution.\n  Since then, the inspectors have reported mixed cooperation from the \nGovernment of Iraq. They have visited hundreds of sites but have not \nfound significant evidence of Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass \ndestruction, despite Saddam Hussein's failure to explain what happened \nto the thousands of tons of chemical and biological weapons material \nthat was known to exist when the inspectors left Iraq 5 years ago.\n  The administration's response, with justification, is that Saddam \nHussein is once again playing a cat-and-mouse game of deceiving the \ninspectors, and that time has finally run out. But the solution is not \nto direct threats and name-calling at some of our oldest allies, or to \ndismiss the U.N. as irrelevant just because some of its members \ndisagree with us. It is counterproductive and beneath a great nation.\n\n  It is no less harmful to mislead the American people. Yesterday's \nWashington Post reported that the President and other administration \nofficials continue to say publicly that the President has not made a \nfinal decision about whether to invade Iraq. These statements lack \ncredibility, especially when the Pentagon continues to amass tens of \nthousands of U.S. troops on Iraq's borders.\n  Yet the White House is telling our potential coalition partners that \nthe decision to invade Iraq has been made. The President has made it, \nthey say, and nothing the U.N. Security Council says or does will \nchange that. They warn that unless the U.N. Security Council abandons \nthe inspections process and supports a U.S.-led military invasion, the \nUnited Nations will become irrelevant.\n  At the same time that White House officials dismiss any meaningful \nrole for the Security Council in the decision to go to war, they are \ncalling on the U.N. to prepare to help take care of as many as 2 \nmillion Iraqi refugees once the war begins. And they make no secret of \nthe fact that they expect the U.N. to play a central role in the \nreconstruction of a post-Saddam Iraq.\n  One of the lessons of the gulf war was that it was far safer for our \ntroops, and of critical importance to our continued relations with the \nArab world, to build a broad international coalition in support of the \nuse of force. The importance of that coalition has been lauded by \nadministration officials and Members of Congress, time and again, in \npublic statements and in testimony.\n  Nothing that has happened since, and nothing that we have heard from \nthis President or his advisers leads one to believe that we should go \nto war without such a coalition. To the contrary, with the threat of \ninternational terrorism fueled by Islamic extremists who fan the flames \nof hatred of Americans, the arguments for building a strong coalition \nwith the backing of the United Nations are even more compelling.\n  It has been 28 years since I was first elected to represent my State \nof Vermont in the Senate. I have served during the administrations of \nfive Presidents Democrat and Republican. I have had my share of \nagreements and disagreements with each of these Presidents on issues of \ngreat importance--from the Vietnam war to the dilemma we face today \nwith Iraq.\n  But never, in all those years, have I seen such an opportunity to use \nthe tremendous influence of the United States to unite the world behind \nthe common goal of disarmament and in doing so to strengthen the United \nNations, mishandled with such arrogance.\n  Today, apparently only weeks away from a war with Iraq, the United \nStates is telling the rest of the world, ``We don't need you.'' Even \nthough we will be risking the lives of American men and women in \nuniform to enforce a United Nations resolution, we are\n\n[[Page S2765]]\n\ngoing to war in spite of our U.N. allies who urge caution and patience.\n  The administration's ultimatum on Iraq is but the latest example of \nits disdain for working with other nations to solve global problems \nfrom arms control to the environment.\n  They thumbed their noses at the Kyoto Treaty, even though the United \nStates uses wastefully a quarter of the world's resources and is by far \nthe largest contributor to global warming.\n  They sabotaged the International Criminal Court, despite the fact \nthat the United States was instrumental in its conception.\n  They have walked away from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and from \nan agreement to strengthen the biological weapons convention.\n  Reasonable people may disagree about the merits of these treaties, \nbut the administration has simply walked away. They have offered no \nconstructive alternatives, they have unnecessarily poisoned relations \nwith allies, and they have undermined our Nation's interests.\n  This pattern has not only alienated and angered those whose support \nwe need, it has made it easier for others to ignore their own \ninternational obligations. It has needlessly and recklessly squandered \nthe good will we felt after September 11, when the Star-Spangled Banner \nplayed outside Buckingham Palace and France's Le Monde declared, ``We \nare all Americans''. This attitude has made us less secure, not more. \nThe administration squandered that worldwide support.\n  I have no doubt, nor does anyone in this Chamber, that our armed \nforces can defeat Saddam Hussein's army, which according to all reports \nis far weaker than it was a decade ago. Nor do any of us differ about \nthe desire to see an end to Saddam Hussein's despicable regime. But the \nrisk that he will use chemical or biological weapons, and of the horror \nthat could result for our own troops, as well as the civilian \ncasualties, are hardly mentioned by the White House.\n  In the meantime, the situation in Afghanistan so recently the focus \nof attention remains extremely unstable.\n  In fact, I read today that Afghanistan has become the largest opium \nexporter in the world.\n  The survival of the Karzai government is far from certain, as \nPakistan, Russia, and Iran continue to provide support and sanctuary to \nAfghan warlords and to the Taliban who fled.\n  Osama bin Laden continues to broadcast threats against Americans, and \nal-Qaida remains active in dozens of countries.\n  A nuclear crisis on the Korean peninsula threatens to spiral out of \ncontrol.\n  In the Middle East, hardly a day passes without shootings or bombings \nby both Israelis and Palestinians. The administration appears to have \nabandoned that crisis.\n  Our allies are divided about the need to abort the U.N. inspections \nprocess and launch a preemptive military invasion of Iraq, and a \nmajority of the American people oppose the use of unilateral U.S. \nmilitary force.\n  I am not among those who believe that under no circumstances would \nforce ever be justified to disarm Saddam Hussein. But why now, when \nthere is such discord even among those who agree about the need for \nIraq to disarm? Why now, when there is no realistic chance that Saddam \nHussein will seek to carry out an act of aggression as long as the U.N. \ninspectors are there? Why now, when the United Nations is seized with \nthis issue? Why now, when giving the inspectors more time could bring \nmore key nations on board with us if the use of force becomes \nnecessary? Why rush to act in a way that will weaken the United \nNations, that will further isolate us from many of our closest allies \nand create more anti-Americanism and quite possibly more terrorists?\n  This country is not close to being united in favor of a preemptive, \nunilateral war with Iraq. It is not a question of whether we can defeat \nSaddam Hussein. It is a question of the long-term risks to our own \nsecurity.\n  The President should listen to the American people. Hundreds of \nthousands of Americans have braved the freezing cold in recent weeks, \nas have millions of people in Europe and elsewhere, to demonstrate \ntheir opposition to the President's policy. They are protesting not in \nsympathy with the Iraqi government but in opposition to a war that \nmight yet be prevented.\n  So today, as our Government moves inexorably towards war, we must \ncontinue to question, we must continue to debate, we must continue to \ndo everything we can to support a policy that makes our country and the \nworld safer, not only for tomorrow but for next year and beyond.\n  If war comes, let us be able to say that it was only because we and \nour allies exhausted every other option, that we acted with the support \nof the Security Council, and in doing so we made the United Nations \nstronger.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n\n\n                           Foster Care Reform\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nVermont for his thoughtful comments. He always brings a really good \nanalysis of any situation to the floor and shares it with us, and I am \nvery grateful to him for that.\n  Occasionally a movie comes to the screen that brings to life the \nstories that have become routine in our newspapers and on our \ntelevision stations, and because of that constant repetition we \nsometimes become numb to the news. That happens across the board on \nmany issues, but there is one in particular I wish to address that I do \nnot think we can ever afford to be numb to or indifferent toward, and \nthat is the abuse and neglect so many children in our country live with \nevery day, the children who are shuffled in and out of our foster care \nsystems, often with little guidance from or connection to any adult. \nToo often these stories end in the most tragic way possible.\n  Seven-year-old Faheem Williams in Newark, NJ, was recently found dead \nin a basement, with his two brothers in a deplorable condition, having \nbeen chained in that basement for weeks at a time. Six-year-old Alma \nManjarrez in Chicago was beaten by her mother's boyfriend and left to \ndie outside in the snow and cold of the winter. And despite 27 visits \nby law enforcement officials to investigate violence, 7-year-old Ray \nFerguson from Los Angeles was recently killed in the crossfire of a gun \nbattle in his neighborhood.\n  Unfortunately, I could take up quite a few minutes of my allotted \ntime telling even more tragic stories such as these, but today I want \nto focus on a different kind of story, a story of hope and possibility, \nthe story of Antwone Fisher.\n  Mr. Fisher overcame tremendous odds. He was born in prison, handed \nover to the State, and lived to tell his story of heartbreaking abuse. \nAt the age of 18, he left foster care for the streets, with nowhere to \nturn. He found the support, education, and structure he desperately \nneeded in the United States Navy. In the Navy, Mr. Fisher received a \nmentor and professional counselor who helped him turn his life around.\n  Mr. Fisher survived that childhood of neglect, abuse, and violence, \nand has lived to inspire us all and send a stern reminder that it is \nour duty to reform the foster care system. I believe we have a moral \nobligation to make sure that no child languishes in this system, left \nto develop his or her own survival skills, without the attention, \nguidance, discipline, and love every child is entitled to from at least \none caring, responsible adult.\n  I believe Antwone Fisher's success story should be the rule, not the \nexception. Tonight, House Majority Leader Tom DeLay and I will be \ncohosting a screening of the movie ``Antwone Fisher''--Mr. Fisher's \nlife story. This is a screening for Members of Congress, but I urge \nanyone listening or watching today to seek this movie out in their \nmovie theater, because it is an inspirational story. It makes you cry, \nit makes you laugh, but it leaves you with the very strong fundamental \nfaith that every one of us can do something to help a child like \nAntwone have a better life.\n  Tom DeLay and I decided to host this together because we both feel it \nis imperative to raise national awareness about foster care. Because \nAntwone Fisher's story is inspirational, we hope his movie will give \nall of us in this Chamber and in the House the inspiration to tackle \nthis tough issue.\n  In the year 2000, Congressman DeLay and I received an award together \nfrom the Orphan Foundation of America for\n\n[[Page S2766]]\n\nthe work we have both done over many years in the area of foster care \nand adoption. My staff and Congressman DeLay's staff have been working \ntogether to try to figure out how we could, across party lines, from \nboth Houses of Congress, help to create the kind of attention that is \nneeded in the lives of our foster care children.\n  I commend the commitment Congressman DeLay and his wife Christine \nhave. This is not just an issue for them. They are certainly strong \nadvocates for foster children, but they are also foster parents.\n  I hope my colleagues in the Senate will join us tonight at the Motion \nPicture Association for this viewing. For those who cannot join and for \nthose who are watching at home, I want to share a little bit about \nAntwone Fisher's story. People should know that his book, called \n``Finding Fish,'' is just as good as the movie. So go out and buy that. \nPass it around. Make sure everybody you go to school with, you work \nwith, you go to church with sees this book and sees this movie.\n  I would like to read a section from the book. Here is how Mr. Antwone \nFisher describes his life story:\n\n       The first recorded mention of me and my life was from the \n     Ohio State child welfare records: Ward No. 13544. Acceptance: \n     Acceptance for the temporary care of Baby Boy Fisher was \n     signed by Mr. Nesi of the Ohio Revised Code. Cause: Referred \n     by division of Child Welfare on 8-3-59. Child is \n     illegitimate; paternity not established. The mother, a \n     minor is unable to plan for the child.' The report when on \n     to detail the otherwise uneventful matter of my birth in a \n     prison hospital facility and my first week of life in a \n     Cleveland orphanage before my placement in the foster care \n     home of Mrs. Nellie Strange. According to the careful \n     notes made by the second of what would be a total of \n     thirteen caseworkers to document my childhood, the board \n     rate for my feeding and care costs the state $2.20 per \n     day.\n\n  Fisher continues to describe the document and writes that the child \nwelfare caseworker felt that his first foster mother had become ``too \nattached'' to him and insisted that he be given up to another foster \nhome.\n  The caseworker documents this change,\n\n       Foster mother's friend brought Antwone in from their car. \n     Also her little adopted son came into the agency lobby with \n     Antwone . . . They arrived at the door to the lobby and the \n     friend and the older child quickly slipped back out the door. \n     When Antwone realized that he was alone with the caseworker, \n     he let out a lusty yell and attempted to follow them.\n       Caseworker picked him up and brought him in. Child cried \n     until completely exhausted and finally leaned back against \n     caseworker, because he was completely unable to cry anymore.\n\n  I know a little bit about this because when I was a law student in \nthe late 1960s and very early 1970s, I worked for the Legal Services \nOrganization. The first case I was assigned to was representing a \nfoster mother who had signed up with the State of Connecticut to care \nfor foster children, and in the contract she signed, it said she would \nnever try to adopt any of her foster children. She was just a weigh \nstation. The children were supposed to be just passing by and through. \nThis little girl who came to live with my client was a child of mixed \nrace, a beautiful little girl. She was left with her foster mother for \na couple of years. And, boy, did that foster mother get attached. \nWouldn't you want a person taking care of a child to become attached? \nAnd just as with Antwone Fisher's case, when the State found out that \nthe foster mother had gotten attached to this little girl, they decided \nthey needed to move her on, put her up for adoption, take her to \nanother foster home, but to break the attachment.\n  I was part of trying to reverse that rule that governed in all the \nStates in the 1960s and early 1970s. I was unsuccessful, although later \nin Arkansas I tried a case where I was able to reverse that rule, \nmaking the argument that is not the best interests of the child \nsupposed to be the guiding standard? Why would we let a bureaucracy and \nthe rules of a bureaucracy determine what is in the best interests of a \nchild, as long as that child was well cared for and that child had a \nhome that was loving and supportive? Why would we break it up?\n  That is what happened to Antwone Fisher. All through his case files, \neveryone always seemed to be slipping away in one sense or another. \nWhen he arrived at his next foster home and as he grew, he was first \nnot told about the circumstances of his birth. All he knew was that he \nfelt unwanted, that he did not belong anywhere to anyone. It was not \nlong before he came to the conclusion that he was an uninvited guest. \nIt was his hardest earliest truth that he wanted to belong somewhere. \nHe wanted a mother and a father. He never knew that. He never knew a \nmother, a father, or a permanent home. Instead, he was left to fend for \nhimself until he was expelled from foster care at the age of 18.\n  That is what we used to do everywhere. It is what we still do in lots \nof places. When you finish high school, you turn 18, whichever happens \nfirst, you are out on the street. I have literally known children whose \nfoster parents and case workers came into the little bedroom, maybe, \nthat they shared with somebody else, took all their belongings, put it \nin a black garbage bag, handed the garbage bag to the child and said: \nWe are finished with you.\n  I cannot even imagine that, but that is what happens. That is what \nhappened to Antwone Fisher when he found himself, at the age of 18, on \nthe streets and homeless.\n  Luckily, somewhere deep inside him, in some sacred place, he found \nthe courage and resilience to keep going with his life, and he found \nhis way to a recruiting station where he volunteered for the U.S. Navy. \nHe needed a place to sleep; he needed food to eat; he needed to be safe \non the streets, and thank goodness he did. Thank goodness the U.S. Navy \ntook a chance on Antwone Fisher.\n  There are lots and lots of children just like him in our foster care \nsystem. There are approximately 542,000 children in our Nation's foster \ncare system; 16,000 of these young people leave foster care every year \njust like Antwone Fisher had to. We worked during the last several \nyears to try to improve conditions.\n  In 1999, when I was First Lady, I advocated for and Congress passed \nthe Chafee Foster Care Independence Act which provides States with \nfunds to give young people assistance with housing and health care and \neducation. It is funded at $140 million annually. That is not nearly \nenough for the needs of these children, but I am very grateful that we \nare doing something to recognize what it means to be the age of 18 and \nhave nowhere to go. I have even met foster children who got admitted \ninto college and during the holidays when most of us who went to \ncollege look forward to going home and seeing our friends and seeing \nour family, they begged to be able to stay in the dorm, even if the \nheat was turned off, because they had no home to go to.\n  This bill came after the very important bipartisan Adoption and Safe \nFamilies Act of 1997 where we made the most sweeping changes in the \nFederal child welfare law since 1980 that once and for all said a \nchild's safety is the paramount issue in any placement. If you cannot \nreturn a child to his or her home with their biological parents, with \ntheir natural family, then let's move to relieve that child of the past \nand put that child in a position to be adopted and placed in a \npermanent home.\n  The next major hurdle we need to tackle is the financing system. \nCurrently, we spend approximately $7 billion annually to protect \nchildren from abuse and neglect, to place children in foster care, and \nto provide adoption assistance. The bulk of this funding falls to \nStates as reimbursements for low-income children taken into foster care \nwhen there is a judicial finding that continuation in their home is not \nsafe. This funding provides payments for foster families to care for \nfoster children, as well as training and administrative costs which \ngives children a safety net. But it is not enough because the financing \nis focused on the time when the child is in foster care. The longer the \nchild stays in foster care, the more money the States get, which makes \nno sense to me. We ought to have the incentives in the other direction.\n  Try to provide the services so you can reunite a child with their \nfamily or make the decision to terminate parental rights and put a \npermanency plan into effect so the child can have a better shot at the \nfuture.\n  I appreciate that President Bush has put a proposal on the table to \nchange the way foster care is financed. I look forward to working with \nhim and my\n\n[[Page S2767]]\n\ncolleagues to try to deal with some of these legitimate issues around \nfinancing. But I cannot support block-granting our child welfare system \nbecause it is imperative we have standards. If the States could have \ndone this on their own, without Federal oversight funding and \nstandards, they would have done so.\n  Therefore, we have to ask ourselves, How do we maintain child safety \nprotections that we passed in the Adoption and Safe Families Act? How \ndo we require the targeting of funds to prevention and postfoster care \nservices? What happens if there is a crisis and more foster care \nchildren enter the system? These are all important questions. They \ndeserve answers. But it is critical we begin the process to look at how \nwe change the incentives.\n  In the past, my colleagues, Senators Landrieu, DeWine, and Grassley, \nput forth a proposal to restructure the priorities in our child welfare \nsystem. I think their proposal was headed in the right direction. It \nensured that incentives were in place so that foster care stays would \nbe shorter. I applaud my colleague Senator Rockefeller, who has been a \nlong-time champion on these issues, for his welfare reform bill which \noffers an alternative to financing child welfare by aligning foster \ncare and adoption assistance with TANF eligibility.\n  I look forward to tackling this hard issue in the months ahead. I \nlook forward to seeing the number of children in foster care decrease. \nI look forward to seeing more children in foster care being reunited \nwith their birth families or being placed into permanent, loving homes.\n  For those of you who want more insight into what this issue is truly \nall about, I urge you to see the movie ``Antwone Fisher,'' to read Mr. \nFisher's book ``Finding Fish,'' to understand that may be just one \nstory but it stands for countless others, innocent children to whom we \nowe a chance for a better life.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article appearing in USA Today be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            [From USA Today]\n\n         Easing Foster Care's Pain Unites Disparate Politicians\n\n               (By Hillary Rodham Clinton and Tom DeLay)\n\n       Occasionally, a movie shines the spotlight of public \n     recognition onto a problem that lingers deep in the nation's \n     shadow. It forces the country either to confront the issue or \n     look away. Today, the movie is Antwone Fisher, and the \n     542,000 children languishing in our broken foster care system \n     are the issue.\n       Antwone Fisher tells the true story of a boy born in prison \n     and abandoned by his mother to years of abuse, both emotional \n     and sexual, in foster care. The compelling story of his life, \n     written by Fisher, is about a child's hope and resilience \n     despite an uncaring system. While we cheer Fisher's success \n     against such abysmal odds, the movie also reminds us that too \n     many still suffer needlessly in a foster care system that is \n     inherently flawed.\n       When Fisher turned 18, the system dropped him onto the \n     streets. Fisher turned to the Navy, where he discovered \n     structure, discipline, the power of education and strong \n     guidance from an adult mentor. This powerful catalyst turned \n     Fisher's life around. But what about all of the others in our \n     foster care system whose longing for meaning and direction \n     goes unrequited?\n       Every year 16,000 young adults age out of this system. Many \n     grew up without guidance and faced enormous hardships. The \n     foster care system simply did not teach them the basic skills \n     to live independently in the world. They never learned how to \n     cook, balance a checkbook or apply for a job. Without this \n     critical guidance, they emerge from a system unwanted and \n     uncertain about navigating life's turns. In short, they enter \n     adulthood the way they spend their childhood: alone.\n\n\n                            Reset priorities\n\n       Fisher's story should spark broad reforms of the foster \n     care system, which needs to be changed, one community at a \n     time, so that no more children fall through the cracks. \n     Despite our political differences, we are committed to \n     working together so that children like Fisher do not languish \n     in foster care until at 18, then get expelled with little \n     guidance and support.\n       The federal government now gives states almost $7 billion \n     annually to protect children from abuse and neglect, place \n     children in foster care and provide adoption assistance. But \n     the timing is off: Most of the money goes to states for use \n     after a child is removed from a troubled home. Instead, it \n     should be used to provide more preventive resources--to keep \n     children out of foster care to begin with--and to assist \n     children after they leave the system.\n       Senators and representatives from both parties acknowledge \n     that we have to change the way we finance our foster care \n     system. Greater emphasis needs to be put on reducing both the \n     number of children in the system and the length of time they \n     stay in foster care. American's children need safe, permanent \n     homes--something Fisher never knew as a child.\n\n\n                          Bush offers one plan\n\n       We can find a bipartisan solution to reform the way we \n     finance our child welfare system, but both the House and \n     Senate must make reforms a priority. President Bush has \n     offered one proposal that deserves careful consideration. He \n     wants to give states an option to change the way foster care \n     is financed so they can do more to prevent children from \n     entering foster care, shorten the time spend in such care and \n     provide more assistance to children and their families after \n     they leave the system.\n       Although reform is never easy, there are proven legislative \n     successes in this area. During the past five years, Congress \n     has passed two major bipartisan child-welfare bills, which we \n     both strongly supported. One helped to nearly double the \n     number of children being adopted from foster care, and the \n     second has helped to provide better transition services for \n     older children who, like Fisher, never are adopted and age \n     out of the foster care system at 18.\n       We are no doubt surprising many of our friends by writing \n     this piece together, but that just underscores our point. If \n     a public-policy dilemma can bring the two of us together, it \n     clearly deserves a hard look from everyone. Fisher's success \n     should be the norm for all children who travel through the \n     foster care system, not be one exceptional spark in the \n     darkness of countless children's lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/26/senate-section/article/S2767-1", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2767]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

ESTRADA, OF VIRGINIA, TO BE UNITED STATES \n           CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n\n                               Continued\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, on the floor today is the former chairman \nof the Judiciary Committee, now the ranking member of the Judiciary \nCommittee, the distinguished senior Senator from Vermont. The Senator \nhas heard me on a number of occasions boast about the work he has done \nas the leader of the Democrats in the Judiciary Committee and the \nleader of the Senate in the Judiciary Committee. There has been a lot \nof talk about the Democrats holding up judicial nominees during the \ntime we were in power in the Senate.\n  It is my understanding--I ask the Senator to respond to this \nquestion--that while the distinguished Senator from Vermont was \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee for a very short period of time--17 \nmonths--he broke all records of the body in approving some 100 Federal \njudges for President Bush.\n  Is that a fair statement?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, it is a fair statement. In fact, I think \nin mid-July we finally got an agreement to organize the committee. Ten \nminutes after we got that agreement, I noticed the first hearing and \nset the first hearing on President Bush's judges.\n  The Republicans had been in charge up to that time--up until July--\nand there were a number of nominees of President Bush, but they had not \nheld any hearings whatsoever. I began the process of holding them \nwithin 10 minutes of the time I became chairman. Then, during the next \n17 months, we held hearings on 103, we voted through 100, voted down 2, \nand had 1 remaining.\n  There is no 17-month period under Republican control with President \nClinton when that was done.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator also respond to this? It is also my \nrecollection that during that 17-month period the Senator from \nVermont's office received a letter which contained anthrax, Senator \nDaschle's office received a letter which contained anthrax, and 9/11 \noccurred. In spite of all that, and the Senate being, in effect, locked \ndown and the country being locked down, still the Judiciary Committee, \nled by the distinguished Senator from Vermont, approved a record number \nof judges, in spite of those items I mentioned--two anthrax attacks, \none on the Senator who is now before me, one on the distinguished \nmajority leader, the Democratic leader, and 9/11.\n  Is that true?\n  Mr. LEAHY. The Senator is absolutely correct. Obviously, we all \nremember how much disruption there was. The letter to the distinguished \nSenator from South Dakota ended up closing the Hart Building and \ntemporarily the Dirksen Building. The letter that was sent to me was so \ntoxic that two people who touched it died. Died. We had not canceled a \nsingle hearing. In fact, on one day when the Senate was being evacuated \nbecause we had scheduled a time to vote out some of President Bush's \nnominees, I literally grabbed Senators and held them here long enough \nto vote out some of President Bush's nominees.\n  I say this knowing that when the Republicans were in charge and \nPresident Clinton was in office, we sometimes went 8 or 9 months \nwithout even having a vote on nominees. We were doing it several times \na month.\n  I appreciate the Senator asking those questions.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator also answer this question? When the Hart \nBuilding was locked down, we were out of space around the Capitol and \nthe Senator had every excuse as chairman of that committee not to hold \nhearings. I remember the Senator holding hearings down in the basement \nof the Capitol. There was not room for people. People were jammed into \nthat room. But the Senator used no excuse to avoid going ahead with \nPresident Bush's nominations to the judiciary.\n\n  Is that true?\n  Mr. LEAHY. The distinguished Senator is absolutely correct. I might \nsay that I commend especially the staff who in some instances were \nworking out of their cars, working out of my hideaway or in the \nhallways, just because even our committee rooms were closed. I had \npeople working out of the family room in my house. We did all of this \nso we could continue what turned out to be a recordbreaking number of \nhearings and votes on President Bush's nominees.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I want to make a brief statement to the \ndistinguished senior Senator from West Virginia.\n  I ask unanimous consent that he be recognized following my very brief \nstatement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I want the Record to reflect that the \nSenator from Vermont has been an exemplary chairman of one of the most \nimportant committees during one of the most difficult times in the \nhistory of this country. And for anyone to ever--I have been on this \nfloor defending the Senator, as I will continue to do my entire career. \nIf anyone ever suggests the Senator from Vermont didn't do stalwart and \nexemplary work, I will take them to task for it. In the most difficult \nof circumstances, in the most partisan times in the history of this \ncountry, the Senator from Vermont was not partisan. He moved the \ncommittee along in a nonpartisan, bipartisan basis. As I recall, 100 \njudges were approved and only two judges were turned down by the \ncommittee.\n  I think it is remarkable what has been done. I appreciate the Senator \nresponding to those brief questions.\n  I want to just say briefly there has been some suggestion we have \nbeen\n\n[[Page S2770]]\n\ntrying to hold up things here. The only one holding up things is the \nmajority. They can move off this nomination five seconds from now. They \ncould give us the information we want or try to invoke cloture. The \nreason we are not off this nomination is they have no plan and nothing \nto do.\n  I would like to read into the Record what Bob Novak--we all know Bob \nNovak. He is one of the most conservative--it is his birthday today. I \nheard it on Public Radio. I wish Bob Novak a happy birthday. Bob Novak \nhasn't been very prone to saying good things about Democrats. But here \nis what he said.\n\n       Novak: Well, the Republicans figured that they would be \n     home at their recess last week and find out what the people \n     wanted. Apparently, the people weren't interested in Estrada, \n     because the Republicans have no idea what to do in the \n     Senate. They had a leadership meeting yesterday afternoon, \n     couldn't figure anything out, had a luncheon of all the \n     Republican senators, didn't figure it out. All that's decided \n     is, they're not going to ask for a cloture vote to force an \n     end to the filibuster, because they'd lost that. But they \n     have no strategy for around-the-clock sessions. They don't \n     know what to do. The Democrats are winning.\n\n  That is Bob Novak.\n  I want this Record spread with the fact that the Democrats if we \nwanted to hold things up, we could be objecting to committees meeting. \nWe could be doing a lot of things just to slow things down. We want to \nspeed things up. We want to get to the business of this country dealing \nwith the economy.\n  I listened to the radio this morning that they were going to have a \ndebate in the British Parliament about the Iraqi war. The senior \nSenator from Illinois told me he listened to an hour of that debate \nthis morning. I think it is wonderful that the British people are able \nto listen to their leaders debate a war. It does not matter what side \nyou are on. Wouldn't it be important to debate the pros and cons of \nthis war?\n  And I say to my friend--my esteemed friend, somebody I admire \ngreatly--the senior Senator from West Virginia, you have been able to \ncome here and sneak a little bit of time--sneak it in--to talk about \nthe war. It has been hard for the Senator to get floor time to talk \nabout this issue.\n  I respect and admire both of these Senators on the floor for being \nsuch great examples to me. But I want everyone to know that we are not \ntrying to take advantage of anyone. If we were doing that, there would \nbe all kinds of things we could do in a parliamentary sense. We are not \ndoing that. We believe the burden is on the majority to move the \nlegislation of this country, and it is not being moved.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nNevada for his kind comments and always for the great services he \nperforms for the American people here in this body.\n  Madam President, is the Senate in executive session?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, it is.\n  Mr. BYRD. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                  The Budgetary Costs of a War in Iraq\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, since last August, the administration has \nworked aggressively to convince the American public that Saddam Hussein \nis a brutal dictator who directly threatens the United States. The \nPresident has been unambiguous, and often dangerously blunt, about his \npassion to use military force to destroy Saddam Hussein's regime.\n  The Bush administration has promoted a vision of Saddam's removal \nfrom power quickly, easily, and bloodlessly. Indeed, part of the \nrationale for support for this war is that America's tremendous \nmilitary superiority over Iraq will confine a military conflict to a \nrelatively painless contest between the United States' awesome military \nforces and the relatively weak, conventional military machine of Saddam \nHussein.\n  A swift and simple military victory certainly is one possibility, but \nin our democratic Republic the administration also has a responsibility \nto inform the American people that much less pleasant scenarios are \nalso possible and even likely. The Congress has a responsibility to \nexplore all possible scenarios with an eye to the eventual costs of \nthis war. We must not just accept the rosy projections so far offered \nby the administration. Frankly, I have seen little effort by either the \nadministration or the Congress to inform the American taxpayer about \nthe likely costs of this war.\n  In both dollars and human lives, the administration has been \nominously quiet about its internal calculations and estimates. What is \neven worse is that the Congress has barely bothered to ask about them.\n  Earlier this month, the President unveiled his budget for the fiscal \nyear 2004. Even assuming the most primitive and loose definition of the \nterm ``fiscal responsibility,'' that budget request should certainly \nhave included some rough estimate cost for a war with Iraq. Even a \nrange of costs would have been somewhat illuminating.\n  But no cost estimate was included in the budget of the President's. \nNow let me repeat that. There is no estimate of the cost of the looming \nwar with Iraq in the President's budget--no cost estimate. That is hard \nto believe, isn't it? But that is the case. The possible war has \ndominated the airwaves for months, and yet there is no cost estimate in \nthe President's budget. President Bush mentions the looming conflict in \nnearly every public pronouncement, and yet no cost estimate to fight \nthe war appears in the President's budget--none. Is the administration \ntrying to tell the people of this Nation it is for free?\n  When the Defense Secretary presented the President's defense budget \nto the Senate Armed Services Committee, and was asked what the \nadministration projected that a war in Iraq would cost, he would only \nsay that such costs are ``not knowable.'' Let us contemplate that \nanswer: ``not knowable.'' Does the Secretary of Defense mean to say \nthat this great Nation does not yet know what its plans include for a \nwar with Iraq? Is that why the costs are ``not knowable''? Does he mean \nto say that we do not yet know exactly what we are going to try to \nachieve in Iraq? Is that why the costs are ``not knowable''? Or does he \nsimply mean to indicate that he does not want to divulge the potential \ncosts, therefore to us they are ``not knowable''?\n  One must presume that by now the administration would have made \nseveral internal forecasts of the military cost of the war using \nvarious scenarios, and that the White House Council of Economic \nAdvisors would have prepared for the President a classified study of \nthe projected economic impact of the war. Reportedly, OMB Director \nMitch Daniels has been working on war estimates for months, and yet we \nare told that these costs are ``not knowable.'' None of this \ninformation has been made available to the public, nor, I suspect, is \nit likely to be released in the near future. This Congress--these two \nHouses; the people's elected Representatives--has a responsibility to \ndemand that information. The people have a right to know. They are \ngoing to suffer the costs. Congress must not accept the answer, ``not \nknowable.'' The American people, I say, deserve to know. They deserve \nto know the truth.\n  There was one cost estimate provided by the administration which came \nfrom an interview last fall with Larry Lindsey, the President's former \neconomic advisor, who said that a war with Iraq could cost between $100 \nbillion and $200 billion. He went on to opine that that was \n``nothing.''\n  Yet the White House quickly distanced itself from that comment, and \nthe Director of the Office of Management and Budget rebuked that \nestimate, saying that Lindsey's estimate was ``very, very high.''\n  The OMB Director suggested that the cost of the war would be closer \nto $60 billion or $70 billion. The Pentagon recently stretched that \nestimate to $95 billion. I wonder just what we are to make of these \nconflicting estimates.\n  How are we to gauge the validity of such widely varying numbers? How \nare the American people to gauge the validity of such widely varying \nnumbers? Do these figures contemplate other complications? What if \ncasualty estimates grow into the thousands? And they may. What if oil \nprices skyrocket, sparking inflation and lines at the gas pump and \ncosting the U.S. economy thousands of American jobs? Suppose the Middle \nEast erupts in a tornado of violence, toppling regime after regime in \nthe region.\n\n[[Page S2771]]\n\n  Even a rudimentary list of the possible contingencies shows that \ncosts may grossly exceed what the administration wants the public to \nbelieve.\n  The Congressional Budget Office reported last September that the \nincremental cost of just deploying a force to the Persian Gulf--that \nis, those costs incurred above those budgeted for routine operations--\ncould be between $9 billion and $13 billion. Prosecuting a war, \naccording to the CBO, could cost between $6 billion and $9 billion per \nmonth. And after hostilities ended, the cost just to return U.S. forces \nto their home bases could range between $5 billion and $7 billion.\n  Regardless of the swiftness of a military victory--it could be swift, \nbut it might not be--there remains the cost of a postwar occupation of \nIraq, which the administration says could last for up to 2 years and \ncould mean another $1 billion to $4 billion, or more, per month during \nthat period. On top of that, the United States might face a \nhumanitarian crisis, including rampant disease and starvation, if \nSaddam Hussein employs a scorched earth strategy in defending his \nregime. What about the need for a cleanup of biological and chemical \nweapons if the Iraqi Republican Guard employs them against U.S. \nsoldiers?\n  Reconstruction and nation-building costs resulting from installing a \ndemocratic government in Iraq have to also be thought about. The \nAmerican Academy of Arts and Sciences projected that the minimum \nreconstruction and nation-building cost for Iraq could be as high as \n$30 billion, and that is under the very best of circumstances. Will the \nadministration propose something similar to the Marshall plan for Iraq? \nThe Academy reported that U.S. investments in Western Europe after \nWorld War II under the Marshall plan cost a total of $13.3 billion over \na 4-year period. That is the equivalent of $450 billion over 4 years if \nmeasured as a percentage of GDP in 2002.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, let me say how much I appreciate the \nclarion call which the very distinguished Senator from West Virginia \nhas been sounding. It is an extremely important issue--actually the No. \n1 challenge facing the country.\n  Am I correct that the budget submitted by the administration--and I \nknow the very able Senator probably knows more about the appropriations \nprocess than any Member of this body--did not contain any money for a \npotential war in Iraq or for subsequent reconstruction efforts?\n  Mr. BYRD. The distinguished Senator from Maryland is preeminently \ncorrect. There is no estimate of what the war will cost in the \nPresident's budget.\n  Mr. SARBANES. So the deficits projected in the President's budget, \nwhich are now going up toward the $300 billion level--and which have \nbroken us out of the situation we were in only a couple of years ago \nwhere we were running surpluses--do not encompass potential costs of \nthis military action in Iraq. In other words, the deficits would be \nsignificantly enhanced by whatever the amount of the cost would be; is \nthat correct?\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Astoundingly, the President's budget does not present such \na cost. The Senator is exactly right.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I was listening carefully to the Senator. As I \nunderstand it--and the estimates are all over the lot--the \nadministration represents that it could last 4 days, or it could last 4 \nweeks, or it could last 4 months; and you try to get them to pinpoint \nit, and they say: Well, who can tell what is going to happen? I gather \neven the Pentagon--and presumably they want to present the best light--\nis estimating a $100 billion cost.\n  Mr. BYRD. It is $95 billion, right under that.\n  Mr. SARBANES. And you have an estimate for the reconstruction that \nwas $30 billion, roughly speaking.\n  Mr. BYRD. At a minimum, $30 billion.\n  Mr. SARBANES. At a minimum. Of course, that was assuming we would not \nhave this kind of devastation out there that might be possible if the \nweapons of mass destruction were to be utilized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Well, these are tremendous costs that are staring us in \nthe face, are they not?\n  Mr. BYRD. They are indeed. It is amazing.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I think it is a very important service the Senator is \nrendering in order to lay this out. Many people seem to be skipping \nright over this dimension, in terms of evaluating the path we should \nfollow in dealing with the challenge we confront in the region.\n  Mr. BYRD. Scriptures say that the wages of sin is death. We are not \nbeing told what the wages of this war are going to amount to. There is \nno discussion. One may be led to believe that this is going to be like \na video game: It will be just over in a matter of moments, in days or \nweeks. There is no discussion of the cost. There is no estimate.\n  Now, I find it very hard to believe that the administration has not \ncarefully explored the potential cost of what the American people are \ngoing to be asked to bear; and I think the polls we read about, which \nindicate a pretty high degree of support for the President in his \npassion to lead us into this war--I don't believe those people who are \nasked questions have any idea whatsoever as to what the costs are going \nto be. Why should they? We ourselves don't have any idea. The \nadministration is not presenting us with any estimates of the cost. \nThis seems to me to be strikingly strange.\n  We are being led into a war--led into a war--by an administration \nthat makes no effort whatsoever to tell the American people what they \nare likely to pay in treasure, in lives, and especially with regard to \na postwar Iraq. I think it is going to be like a bottomless pit.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Senator for bringing this to our attention. \nIt is an extremely important point, and the Senator is absolutely \nright. It has simply been glossed over in any consideration of this \nmatter.\n  Mr. BYRD. Oh, yes, glossed over. There seems to be no thought given \nto it. I want to tell the Senator from Maryland that we on the \nAppropriations Committee and the American taxpayers are going to learn \nabout it at some point when it is over, and the costs of this war may \nbe colossal.\n  The time to ask questions is now, not a year from now, not when the \nbody bags start coming back, not when the paying of the toll is coming \ndue.\n  Madam President, I thank the distinguished Senator, one of the most \nable Senators I have ever seen in my 45 years in this body and in my 50 \nyears on Capitol Hill. He is on committees that know something about \ndollars and cents and how they add up. I thank him for his incisive \nquestions.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Senator.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, will my friend yield briefly for a \nfollowup to Senator Sarbanes' questions?\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I do yield.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend. I wish to add my voice to that of \nSenator Sarbanes and thank the Senator from West Virginia for his great \nleadership. I want him to know that in California, my constituents have \ntalked to me about the Senator's statements many times. I spent the \nweek in California, and they have received through e-mail a copy of the \nmost recent statement Senator Byrd made on the Senate floor. It gives \nthem hope to know that he is out here with all his years, his sage \nyears here, and it really helps. It is a great help to me as well as a \nnewer Senator, although one who has been here for 10 years and 10 years \non the other side.\n  I wish to pick up on the questions of, as we look at the costs of \nthis war, to set aside the human costs, about which I have spoken at \nlength and about which the Senator from West Virginia has continually \nbeen so eloquent, there is also the cost, for example, of payments to \nour friend and ally, Turkey, which, as I understand it, also is not in \nthe budget request; am I correct?\n  Mr. BYRD. The able Senator is correct.\n  Mrs. BOXER. We are hearing everything from $6 billion in cash to an \nadditional $10 billion to $20 billion in loan guarantees, and yet not a \nword in the budget. I wish to ask a final question of my friend, and \nthat is, I was amazed to read that our friend, Carl Levin, on\n\n[[Page S2772]]\n\nthe Armed Services Committee, was asking questions of the Pentagon \nabout how many troops would be needed in the aftermath of war, \nimmediately following perhaps for 2 years, perhaps longer, the number \nof troops that need to be put out there. The answer was 200,000 troops, \nand it took the breath of many of our colleagues. Again, I ask my \nfriend a question: Is there any mention of that fact in the 2004 budget \nand the impact of that on our budget?\n  Mr. BYRD. No, there is no mention of that fact. I must say, I have \nbeen informed that figure was inaccurate and that the general who used \nthat figure later retracted the figure.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Does my friend know what they are talking about in terms \nof the number of troops? I suppose a lot would depend upon whether we \nhave a lot of our allies with us, would it not?\n\n  Mr. BYRD. I am sure it would depend in great measure upon that. I do \nnot think the administration has made any presentation of such a figure \nat all. I understand the British are going to supply 26,000 personnel, \nbut there is no indication of what the other countries--and there are \nsupposed to be a considerable number of other countries that would be \nsupporting us, but nobody has indicated how many troops those other \ncountries are going to present, and I am not sure they could present a \ngreat number. Angola, Cameroon, there are various and sundry other \nnations, some of which names I am almost unfamiliar with. They are \nincluded in this array of allies we are going to have supporting the \neffort.\n  (Mr. Cornyn assumed the Chair.)\n  Mrs. BOXER. In closing, I again thank my friend very much. The fact \nthat a general, a very highly placed general, would come out with a \nnumber that is not correct, is in itself astounding. It means he \ncertainly is not informed either. Not only are we uninformed, but he is \nuninformed, and this should give even more pause about this whole \nsituation. I thank my friend for the energy he is putting into this \nissue. Again, my people in California are very grateful for what the \nSenator from West Virginia is doing.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator, and I \nthank the people of California for their interest in the subject \nmatter, and they certainly should be interested in it.\n  No one likes to talk about putting a price tag on national security, \nbut these costs simply cannot be ignored in light of our current \nsagging economy and given a projected budget deficit of $307 billion \nfor the fiscal year 2004. Remember--remember, Mr. President--this \nGovernment is going to have to borrow the money to finance this war. \nThe total price of a war in Iraq could easily add up to hundreds of \nbillions of dollars, even a trillion or more, overwhelming a Federal \nbudget that is already sliding into deep deficits and warping the U.S. \neconomy and impacting the economies of other nations for years to come. \nAnd, unlike the gulf war in 1991, many of our allies are unlikely to \nwant to help much in defraying these costs.\n  Right now, the administration is trying to coax other nations to join \nthe ``coalition of the willing'' by paying them, not by asking them to \nhelp us pay for the war. A ``coalition of the willing,'' or a COW for \nshort. It appears to me that the U.S. is the ``cow''--the cash cow in \nthis instance. We are the ones who are being milked.\n  The administration reportedly has negotiated a multibillion-dollar \npackage of grants and loans for the Republic of Turkey for use of its \nbases to open a possible northern front against Iraq. The \nadministration is negotiating similar multibillion-dollar packages with \nEgypt, Israel, Jordan, and other allies in the Middle East. I wonder if \nMembers are aware of the details of any of these deals in the works or \ntheir projected costs over time.\n  I believe the cost of this war will be staggering.\n  We know that our Nation's most precious treasure, the lives of our \nyoung men and women in uniform, will most certainly be threatened. But \nwe do not know how great the risk is because the administration will \nnot talk about its plans.\n  In addition, the cost in terms of taxpayer dollars will be absolutely \nenormous. We hear of negotiations ongoing with Turkey that are in the \narea of $30 billion. We learn of requests from Israel for $12 billion. \nIn addition, Jordan wants to be compensated. We read that negotiations \nare underway to provide economic assistance to Mexico, Chile, and \nvarious African nations, all of which are members of the United Nations \nSecurity Council.\n  Where will this all end? Where? How many nations will be promised \nAmerican economic assistance just for their tacit support? And how \nstrong is support that can be bought with promises of American dollars? \nThis is no way to operate. This is no way to fight a war.\n  If the case against Saddam Hussein were strong enough on its merits \nthe United States would not have to buy the support of the \ninternational community. If the world truly believes that Saddam \nHussein poses an imminent threat, then let the world say so clearly. \nBut do not taint that decision, do not taint the possible sacrifice of \nAmerican soldiers, sailors, and airmen, by prying open the door to war \nwith a blank check from the American taxpayers.\n  If war is undertaken without U.N. sanction or broad international \nsupport, the United States taxpayer can expect to pay the costs of the \nwar for decades and pay the interest costs for decades more.\n  And that is to say nothing about the larger macroeconomic costs to \nthe economy. The economic ripples of a war could spread beyond direct \nbudgetary costs into international energy markets through higher oil \nprices. The psychological effects of a war in Iraq, especially if it \ninitiates new terrorist attacks around the globe, could further scare \nthe already jittery financial markets and rattle consumers.\n  If the war goes badly--and it could. Who knows? If the war goes \nbadly, either through heavier than expected causalities, protracted \nbloody urban warfare, massive foreign denunciations, chemical and \nbiological warfare, or major terrorist attacks here and abroad, we may \nbe plunging our economy into unfathomable debt which this nation cannot \neasily sustain.\n  But even if one discounts these scenarios as unlikely, and sets them \nall aside, the potential costs of a limited war in Iraq could continue \nto pile up for years, depending on the total damage to Iraq, the \ncivilian casualties, and the possibility that the war's effects could \nspread into other countries.\n  This is a dangerous and damaging game the administration is playing \nwith the American public--with you, you who are looking through those \nelectronic lenses at the Senate. Glossing over the cost of a war with \nIraq may make it easier to win short-term support. But without any \nserious attention to costs, the American people cannot be engaged in a \nfulsome public discussion about the eventual wisdom of undertaking this \nwar. Public support cannot be sustained to accomplish our post-war \ngoals in Iraq if the Nation has been misled about the duration and \ndifficulty and costs of such a conflict. We cannot treat the citizens \nof this Nation as if they are children who must be fed a fairy tale \nabout fighting a glorious war of ``liberation'' which will be cheap, \nshort and bloodless. If the President is going to force this Nation to \nengage in this unwise, potentially disastrous, and alarmingly expensive \ncommitment, he must lay out all of the costs and risks to the Nation.\n  Now we will come back to these lines again and again. If I am not \nhere, the American people will still come back to the record that is \nbeing written.\n  What is particularly worrisome is how naively the idea of \nestablishing a perfect democracy in Iraq is being tossed around by this \nadministration. If the administration engages in such a massive \nundertaking without the American people understanding the real costs \nand long-term commitment that will be required to achieve this \nvisionary scheme, our efforts in Iraq could end with chaos in the \nregion. Chaos, poverty, hopelessness, hatred--that is exactly the kind \nof environment that becomes a fertile breeding ground for terrorists.\n  The administration is asking the American public and the \ninternational community to support this war. The administration must \nalso put all of its cards on the table. A list of real risks and down \nsides do the Nation no good locked in Donald Rumsfeld's desk drawer. \nThey must be brought into the sunshine for the people to assess.\n  The American people are willing to embrace a cause when they judge it \nto\n\n[[Page S2773]]\n\nbe noble and both its risks and its benefits are explained honestly to \nthem. But if information is withheld, long-term political support can \nnever be sustained. Once the order is given and the bombs start \nfalling, the lives of American troops and innocent civilians on the \nground hang in the balance. Once ``boots are on the ground,'' concerns \nabout the monetary cost of war necessarily take a back seat. This \nnation will not shortchange the safety of our fighting men and women \nonce they are in harm's way.\n  But our people and this Congress should not have to wait until our \ntroops are sent to fight to know what we are facing, including the \npainful costs of this war in dollars, political turmoil, and blood.\n  In a democratic-Republic, secrecy has no place. Hiding information \nfrom the public to rally support behind a war, at the very time when \nthe government should be striving for maximum trust will eventually \nundermine our nation's strength. This conflict will be paid for with \nthe people's treasure and the people's blood. This is no time to \naffront that sacrifice with beltway spin and secrecy.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, for the past few weeks, we have had a \nvigorous debate on the floor and in the country on this nomination. I \ndiscussed my reasons for opposing Mr. Estrada's nomination before the \nrecess. As I said then, I would probably vote to confirm Mr. Estrada to \na lower court. But for this crucial court, at this crucial time, he is \nnot the right person for the job. I have reached that conclusion in \npart because Mr. Estrada gave us so little to work with in trying to \nunderstand what kind of judge he would be. When we are talking about a \nlifetime appointment to the second highest court in this country, we \ncannot be expected to take it on faith that Mr. Estrada will be a fair \nand impartial judge, with no ideological axe to grind. The Senate's \nrole is too important to just ``hope for the best.'' No, when we are \nasked to confirm a nominee to such a significant post, we have a right \nto expect that nominee to be forthcoming in answering our questions, \nand we have a right to expect the administration to be cooperative in \nproviding any information that is relevant to making our decision. That \nis what the advice and consent process is about. Not some kind of phony \n``consultation'', and certainly not a rubberstamp for the President's \nnominees.\n  Today I want to respond to some of the arguments that have been \nraised by those who support the nomination. Many of the arguments come \nin the form of twisting and misstating the reasons given by opponents, \nin order to ridicule them. Many have been creating straw men in order \nto knock them down.\n  For example, we have heard numerous times that Senators oppose Mr. \nEstrada because he has no judicial experience, and the answer to that \nstraw man is that many distinguished judges had no judicial experience. \nThat is certainly true. I agree with that. Some great appellate judges \nhad no prior judicial experience. Some of them sat or sit on the DC \nCircuit.\n  But those of us who note Mr. Estrada's lack of judicial experience \nare not saying that that should disqualify him from serving in this \nposition. What we are saying is that his lack of experience means he \nlacks a record to evaluate, unlike many of the other individuals that \nPresident Bush has nominated to the circuit courts, who have served for \nmany years as US District Court judges. At the same time, Mr. Estrada \nhas not been a law professor and written scholarly articles for \npublication. His lack of judicial experience is part of his lack of a \nrecord that we can review in order to see what kind of judge he will \nbe.\n  That brings me to the Solicitor General memos. In a way, this is \nreally the crux of the problem with Mr. Estrada. Because Mr. Estrada \nhas no judicial experience, because he has not written articles as a \nlaw professor, because he is so young and some of his most significant \nlegal experience was as a lawyer in the Solicitor General's office, and \nbecause questions have been raised about his performance in that \noffice, we have asked to see the memos that he wrote to his superiors \non questions such as whether the United States Government should appeal \nan adverse ruling to the Supreme Court or whether it should file an \namicus brief in a case that the Supreme Court has decided to hear.\n  This request was originally made by then Chairman Leahy in May 2002, \nmonths before Mr. Estrada had his hearing before the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee. So the claim that the request for these documents is a last \nminute effort to derail the nomination is patently untrue. We have been \nseeking these documents for nearly a year now, and the administration \nhas been stonewalling for nearly a year now.\n  I am afraid I have to say it has also been stonewalling in a really \ndisingenuous way. The administration, echoed by supporters of Mr. \nEstrada here on the floor, has claimed that our request is \nunprecedented, that no such memos have ever been turned over to the \nSenate. One Senator stated unequivocally:\n\n       Never in the history of the Justice Department have those \n     type of materials that are privileged, confidential work \n     product materials been given to this branch of Government or \n     any other branch.\n\n  That is a pretty strong statement. It is also untrue. For example, \nduring the consideration of the nomination of William Bradford Reynolds \nto be Associate Attorney General at the Department of Justice, exactly \nthese kinds of memos--recommendations on appeals and amicus briefs \nwritten by line attorneys--were turned over to the Judiciary Committee. \nThen, during the consideration of the nomination of Robert Bork to the \nSupreme Court, a large amount of material was turned over to the \nCommittee, including memos written to or from Judge Bork when he served \nas Solicitor General. In particular, memos to Judge Bork from Judge \nFrank Easterbrook, who then served in exactly the same position as Mr. \nEstrada did when he was in Solicitor General's office, were made \navailable to the Senate.\n  Still the Justice Department disputed the facts and continued to \ninsist that only limited materials were made available during the Bork \nnomination and other materials must have been leaked. But Senator Leahy \nhas disclosed a 1988 letter from Acting Assistant Attorney General \nThomas Boyd to Senator Biden, requesting the return of materials that \nhad been turned over during the confirmation proceedings. Mr. Boyd \nstates:\n\n       [M]any of the documents provided to the Committee, \n     ``reflect or disclose purely internal deliberations within \n     the Executive Branch, the work product of attorneys in \n     connection with government litigation or confidential legal \n     advice received from or provided to client agencies within \n     the Executive Branch.''\n       We provided these privileged documents to the Committee in \n     order to respond fully to the Committee's request and to \n     expedite the confirmation process.\n\n  It is abundantly clear that the Justice Department has provided these \nkinds of materials in the past, despite their confidentiality. And that \nis as it should be. I have enormous respect for some of the former \nSolicitors General who have written to us and given their view that \nthese memos should not be released. But with respect, they are not \nSenators. They are not accountable to constituents for the votes that \nthey take on whether to confirm judicial nominees. They have never made \npolicy for this body, and unless they run for election in the States \nwhere they live, they never will.\n  The White House and some of our colleagues have also argued that \nthese kinds of memos have not been requested of all nominees who once \nserved in that office or in a similar position in the Department of \nJustice. True enough. But that only underscores how important our \nrequest is. I say again, it is because Mr. Estrada has no judicial \nexperience, because he has not written articles as a law professor, \nbecause he is so young and some of his most significant legal \nexperience was as a lawyer in the Solicitor General's office, and \nbecause questions have been raised about his performance in that \noffice, that we have asked to see these materials.\n\n[[Page S2774]]\n\n  The administration's failure to comply with our legitimate request, a \nrequest which is strongly supported by precedent in the Judiciary \nCommittee's handling of past nominations, frankly leads to the question \nof whether there is something to hide in those memos. We will never \nknow until we have a chance to read them. But what we do know is that \nuntil they are turned over this logjam will continue.\n\n  Now some have made the argument on this floor and in the press that \nour action in delaying a vote on Mr. Estrada is unprecedented. That is \nplainly not the case, and again illustrates the amount of distortion \nthat is occurring in this debate. According to CRS, there have been \ncloture motions filed on 14 judicial nominees since 1980. Just three \nyears ago, cloture votes were required before two of President \nClinton's nominees to the Ninth Circuit, Marsha Berzon and Richard \nPaez, could be confirmed. When these nominations were finally reported \nfrom committee after years and years of delay, motions to proceed to \ntheir consideration on the floor were defeated by the Republican \nmajority. Over 5 months later, the nominations were finally brought to \nthe floor. The two nominations were considered and debated together, \nand a cloture motion was required to end the debate on each nominee.\n  It is true that both the majority leader at the time, Senator Lott, \nand Senator Hatch, supported cloture on the nominations. But still, \nthere certainly was a filibuster on those nominees. That is what \ncloture votes do; they end filibusters. Senator Bob Smith was leading \nthe opposition to the nominees. He put out a press release indicating \nthat he was filibustering to stop them. Late last week, we heard from \none Senator that this is the first ``true filibuster'' of a Circuit \ncourt nominee. I am still waiting to hear an explanation of what a true \nfilibuster is compared to what happened with Judges Berzon and Paez. Is \na ``true filibuster'' only one that seems to have the votes to succeed? \nThat is an interesting definition.\n  Let us not forget that in so many other cases during President \nClinton's term in office, there was no filibuster because his nominees \nwere never given a hearing or a vote in the Judiciary Committee. That \nis what happened to two nominees to the Circuit to which Mr. Estrada \nhas been nominated. Alan Snyder, nominated by President Clinton in June \nof 1999, finally had a hearing in May of 2000, but never received a \nvote in Committee. Elena Kagan, nominated in September 1999, never even \nhad a hearing in the Committee. So how exactly is that fairer treatment \nthan a filibuster? The claims that this nominee is subject to \nunprecedented unfairness because an up or down vote is not being \npermitted at this time ring hollow.\n  It is time for the Administration to face up to what happened over \nthe last six years that President Clinton was in office. The DC Circuit \nis a very good place to start. There are two more vacancies on that \ncircuit. If President Bush were to resubmit Mr. Snyder and Ms. Kagan's \nnames, the court would remain balanced, and the President could really \nchange the tone of the judicial nominations issue. For now, we are \nfaced with an effort to fill a slot held open for years of a Democratic \npresidency with a nominee whose views are a mystery. That is not \nacceptable and we must continue to resist it.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            medicare equity\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I would also like to address one of the \nmost important issues facing my state of Wisconsin, as well as many \nothers across the country, the need to restore fairness to the Medicare \nprogram.\n  During any debate of Medicare reform, one of Congress' top priorities \nshould be to reduce regional inequalities in Medicare spending and \nsupport providers of high-quality, low-cost Medicare services.\n  The high cost of health care in Wisconsin is skyrocketing: A recent \nsurvey found that the cost of health benefits for employees in \nWisconsin rose 14.8 percent last year, to an average of $6,940 per \nemployee. That is 20 percent higher than the national average of $5,758 \nfor workers in businesses with 500 or more employees. These costs are \nhitting our state hard--they are burdening businesses and employees, \nhurting health care providers, and preventing seniors from getting full \naccess to the care that they deserve.\n  One of the major contributing factors to the high cost of care in our \nstate is the inherent unfairness of the Medicare Program. With the \nguidance and support of people across our state who are fighting for \nMedicare fairness, I have proposed legislation to address Medicare's \ndiscrimination against Wisconsin's seniors, employers and health care \nproviders. The Medicare program should encourage the kind of high-\nquality, cost-effective Medicare services that we have in Wisconsin. \nBut as many in Wisconsin know, that is not the case.\n  To give an idea of how inequitable the distribution of Medicare \ndollars is, imagine identical twins over the age of 65. Both twins \nworked at the same company all their lives, at the same salary, and \npaid the same amount to the federal government in payroll taxes, the \ntax that goes into the Medicare Trust Fund. But if one twin retired to \nLouisiana or Florida and the other retired in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, \nthey would have vastly different health care options under the Medicare \nsystem. The twin in Louisiana or Florida would get much more.\n  For example, in most parts of Louisiana and Florida, the first twin \nwould have more options under Medicare. The high Medicare payments in \nthose areas allow Medicare beneficiaries to choose between an HMO and a \ntraditional fee-for-service plan, and, because area health care \nproviders are reimbursed at such a high rate, those providers can \nafford to offer seniors a broad range of health care services.\n  The twin in Eau Claire does not have the same access to care--there \nare no options to choose from in terms of Medicare HMOs, and sometimes \nfewer health care agencies that can afford to provide care under the \ntraditional fee-for-service plan.\n  How can two people with identical backgrounds, who paid the same \namount in payroll taxes, have such different options under Medicare?\n  They can because the distribution of Medicare dollars among the 50 \nstates is grossly unfair to Wisconsin, and much of the country. \nWisconsinites pay payroll taxes just like every American taxpayer, but \nthe Medicare funds we get in return are lower than those received in \nmany other states. Legislation that I and others have proposed will \ntake us a step in the right direction by reducing the inequities in \nMedicare payments to Wisconsin's hospitals, physicians, and skilled \nnursing facilities.\n  Last year, with the introduction my Medicare fairness legislation and \nthe efforts of many other Senators, including both the chair and \nranking member of the Finance Committee, we put Medicare fairness \nissues front and center in Congress. We saw many successes. The Senate \nBudget Committee approved my amendment to promote Medicare fairness in \nany Medicare reform package. A wide range of Senators from both parties \nendorsed my proposal to create a Medicare fairness coalition. The House \npassed a number of Medicare fairness provisions that were a result of \nthese successes, and both House and Senate leadership endorsed Medicare \nfairness issues.\n\n  Now that we have finally brought these issues the attention that they \ndeserve, we need to build on that momentum to pass Medicare fairness \nprovisions into law. Some of this increased awareness can be seen in \nthe recently passed omnibus spending bill. While I opposed this \nlegislation, I was especially pleased that it contained provisions that \ntake us a step toward fairness in the distribution of Medicare dollars \nin Wisconsin and other states across the country. By increasing the \nMedicare payments to small urban and rural providers, we are closer to \nreducing the inequities that plague the Medicare system.\n  I hope that these provisions are only the first steps that Congress \ntakes to restore Medicare fairness for Wisconsin and other affected \nStates. Medicare\n\n[[Page S2775]]\n\nshouldn't penalize high-quality providers of Medicare services, and \nmost of all, Medicare should stop penalizing seniors who depend on the \nprogram for their health care. They have worked hard and they have paid \ninto the program all their lives, and in return they deserve full \naccess to the wide range of benefits that Medicare has to offer.\n  So I look forward to working with my colleagues to move legislation \nforward. I believe that we can rebalance the budget, while at the same \ntime encouraging efficient, quality-enhancing Medicare services.\n  Mr. President, I have one other topic.\n\n\n                      supporting first responders\n\n  Mr. President, I would also like to take this opportunity to talk \nabout the need for Congress to help first responders do what they do so \nwell: protect our communities in an emergency.\n  The Department of Homeland Security is creating a massive shift in \nthe Federal Government. Nobody will feel the impact of this shift more \nthan the brave men and women who work in law enforcement, as \nfirefighters, as rescue workers, as emergency medical service \nproviders, and as first responders. We must make sure that these first \nresponders have the resources that they need.\n  While I commend the administration for raising the funding dedicated \nto first responders in the President's budget, I am concerned that \nthese new layers of bureaucracy and reorganization could reduce these \nfunding levels or, just as harmfully, put up barriers to first \nresponders actually receiving these funds.\n  The Federal agencies in the proposed Department of Homeland Security \nmust listen to the priorities of our communities. After all, the needs \nof first responders actually vary among regions, as well as between \nrural communities and urban communities. In Wisconsin, I have heard \nneeds ranging from training, to equipment, to more emergency personnel \nin the field, just to name a few.\n  So I have proposed legislation, along with my friend from Maine, the \nchair of the Governmental Affairs Committee, that would promote \neffective coordination among Federal agencies under the Department of \nHomeland Security and ensure that our first responders--our \nfirefighters, law enforcement, rescue, and EMS providers--can help \nFederal agencies and the new Department of Homeland Security improve \nexisting programs and future initiatives.\n  This is what it would do: It would first establish a Federal Liaison \non Homeland Security in each State and coordinate between the \nDepartment of Homeland Security and State and local first responders. \nThis office would serve not only as an avenue to exchange ideas, but \nalso as a resource to ensure that the funding and programs are \neffective.\n  For example, my hope is that the Homeland Security Department will \nmake programs such as the Fire Act a high priority. The Fire Act \nprovides grants directly to fire departments across our Nation for \ntraining and equipment needs. Last year, I visited one excellent \nexample of this program in West Allis, WI, where the department \nreceived a grant in 2001 to implement a wellness and fitness program \nfor their firefighters. I am told that it is one of the first \ndepartments in the State to meet the goals of this program, and I \ncommend the department for its efforts.\n  Our legislation would also direct the agencies within the Department \nof Homeland Security to coordinate and prioritize their activities that \nsupport first responders, and at the same time, ensure effective use of \ntaxpayer dollars. As part of this coordination, the First Responders \nSupport Act would establish a new advisory committee of those in the \nfirst responder community to identify and streamline effective \nprograms.\n  Last year, both the original Senate and House homeland security bills \nlacked the provisions needed to ensure that the new Department of \nHomeland Security communicates and coordinates effectively with first \nresponders.\n  During the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee markup of the \nhomeland security bill last year, I was pleased to see the committee \nadded our First Responders Support Act to the legislation. It did so \nknowing that we would have to reconcile the overlap between our \nlegislation and the language in the chairman's mark creating an office \nfor State and local government coordination. Our amendment, which was \napproved by the full Senate, did exactly that. Unfortunately, our \nproposal was dropped from the final bill during conference.\n  I hope congress can make enactment of this legislation one of its \npriorities this year. We must be aggressive in seeking the advice of \nour first responders, and helping them to get the resources that they \nneed to provide effective services. They are on the front lines, and \nthey deserve our support.\n  In almost any disaster, the local first responders and health care \nproviders play an indispensable role. If the Department of Homeland \nSecurity is to be effective, we need to ensure that the resources are \ndelivered to the front line personnel in an effective and coordinated \nmanner. I urge my colleagues to join me in passing this proposal and \nothers to support our first responders.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I have been a Senator for a little less \nthan 2 months. The same is true for the Presiding Officer. And we ran \nat a time when I believe the message from the people--and not just of \nMinnesota but I believe the people in America--was one that it is \nimportant the Senate should get things done. The 170th Congress had not \npassed appropriations bills, had not passed disaster assistance, had \nnot passed a prescription drug benefit for seniors, and had not passed \na budget. A lot of serious work needed to be done. That was the \nmessage.\n  We are here now--in a little less than 2 months--and we are caught up \nin a filibuster. I read about filibusters when I was a kid. This \nbasically means the Senate is spending a lot of time debating the \nnomination of Miguel Estrada to be a judge in the Court of Appeals for \nthe District of Columbia Circuit, and the distinguished members of the \nminority party are not going to allow that nomination to get to a vote \nunless there are 60 Senators who vote for cloture to put an end to the \nfilibuster.\n  During the course of the discussion about Miguel Estrada, there have \nbeen some wonderful presentations on both sides of the aisle about the \nimportance of the Constitution, the very sacred obligation of the \nSenate to advise and consent on nominations made by the President of \nthe United States on judicial appointments.\n  In those wonderful discussions talking about this sacred obligation, \nmy fear is that the public may not understand that obligation is not to \nhave 60 Senators vote to confirm a nomination, that to require 60 votes \nis what is known as a supermajority. The Constitution reserves \nsupermajorities to very specific instances--the approval of treaties--\nbut not for the confirmation of Presidential nominees to the Federal \ncourts. That should take a simple majority.\n  So what we are faced with today is the very serious issue of an \neffort to change the constitutional standard for the selection of \njudges. And for all of us who love this Constitution, who understand \nits greatness--and I think through Divine guidance given to those who \nstood before us in chambers and in the Old Senate Chamber--to change \nthe standard for Miguel Estrada is simply wrong.\n  It is not the right thing to do. What our distinguished colleagues in \nthe minority party should do is the right thing and simply give the \nSenate a chance to vote on the nomination of Miguel Estrada--vote and \nsay you need 51 votes to confirm this nomination. That is the \nconstitutional standard.\n  The Web site of one of the most egregious liberal Washington interest \ngroups has a number of troubling statements regarding the nomination \nand confirmation process for members of the judiciary. One memorandum \ndiscusses ``the approaching armageddon on judicial nominations.'' This \nextreme and inflammatory headline suggests an all-out, no-holds-barred, \nanything-goes campaign against judicial nominees by\n\n[[Page S2776]]\n\nthose opposing the President's choices. Another headline on the same \nWeb site demands its members and visitors to ``tell Senators: \nFilibuster the Estrada nomination.''\n  I do not believe there has been, in the history of this esteemed \nbody, a filibuster of a circuit judge. I do not believe there has been \na partisan filibuster of the type we are experiencing right now in the \nSenate.\n  On Wednesday, February 5, 2003, the Washington Post published an \neditorial referencing this Web site and condemning such tactics and \nurged a vote on the nomination of Miguel Estrada.\n  The editorial in the Washington Post correctly points out that a \nfilibuster would be ``a dramatic escalation of the judicial nomination \nwars.'' It states that Democrats who disagree with the nominee may vote \nagainst him, but they should not deny him a vote. The editorial \nconcludes that Mr. Estrada's nomination should not be stalled any \nlonger, stating:\n\n       It certainly doesn't warrant further escalating a war that \n     long ago got out of hand.\n\n  As I listen to the debate, it seems that there are a lot of feelings \nthat somebody did something in the past and now we are going to pay \nback today. There was an earlier time of feuds between the Hatfields \nand the McCoys, and the Earps and the Youngers. That is not the way to \nact in the 21st century, when we face the challenges of a potential war \nwith Iraq and with a struggling economy and with moms and dads worried \nabout feeding and clothing their kids and sending their kids to good \nschools. We should not be caught up in this kind of partisan feuding, \nsaying you did something in the past to our nominees, so now we are \ngoing to do the same to yours today. Put it aside.\n  I am a product of the sixties philosophy. Let today be the first day \nof your life. We are never going to be younger than we are today, Mr. \nPresident. I think we have to put the past behind us. I don't know who \nwas at fault in the past. I don't know about other nominees and the \ntime it took them to get to the floor of the Senate, why they were \ndelayed, for whatever reasons. All I know is that, today, Americans are \ncrying out for the Senate to simply get the work of the people done. We \ncan get the work done if we give Miguel Estrada a chance to simply have \nan up-or-down vote. That is all it is.\n  We should not change the constitutional standard. We should not be \nrequiring 60 votes to confirm a judicial nominee. That is not what the \ngreatness of this institution is about. That is not what the \nConstitution, which has preserved this country and set the standard for \ndemocracy, intended.\n  Let us have a clear understanding of what a modern day filibuster \nmeans. Those advocating this obstructionist tactic aren't demanding the \nopportunity for extended debate; that is already available to all \nSenators. The practical matter of a filibuster is to prevent a vote on \nthe nominee, unless cloture is obtained. Of course, cloture requires 60 \nvotes. As I said before, those calling for a filibuster on this nominee \nare demanding a supermajority vote. That is not what the Constitution \nsays. That is not what the Constitution dictates. That is not the \nprecedent and pattern we should be following. This is against the \ntraditions and practices of this body. In fact, in only one instance \ndid the Senate reject cloture and defeat a judicial nominee. That was \nin 1968, on the nomination of Justice Abe Fortas to be Chief Justice of \nthe Supreme Court.\n\n  As I noted before, that was a bipartisan filibuster--not the party-\nline filibuster we are seeing waged here today against Mr. Estrada.\n  I agree with the previous chairman of the Judiciary Committee, a \nDemocrat, who said in a speech on the Senate floor--I believe it was \nthe Senator from Vermont:\n\n       I have stated over and over again on this floor . . . that \n     I would object and fight against any filibuster on a judge, \n     whether it is somebody I opposed or supported, that I felt \n     the Senate should do its duty.\n\n  Let the Senate do its duty. Let those who oppose the nomination of \nMiguel Estrada have their right to cast their vote, have a right to \nhave their say, for whatever reasons. It is within their discretion to \nchoose their reason to say no. On the other hand, let us follow the \ndictates of our Constitution and not change the constitutional \nstandard. Let us give Miguel Estrada the opportunity simply for an up-\nor-down vote, and let a majority of Senators in the Senate--and I \nbelieve that a majority, which would be a bipartisan majority, not just \nfolks of one party, but distinguished members of the minority party who \nsupport the nomination, would not change the constitutional standard.\n  During the course of this debate, there have been many serious \nmisrepresentations of the record on Mr. Estrada. I want to address in \nsome detail one of the most serious distortions, which concerns the \nanswers that Mr. Estrada gave to questions that members of the \nJudiciary Committee asked him.\n  The charge being leveled against Mr. Estrada is that he did not \nanswer questions put to him in general, and he did not answer questions \nabout his judicial philosophy in particular. I have to say, that charge \nis pure bunk.\n  I sat here and listened as some of my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle said he didn't answer questions. I have the transcript in \nfront of me. He was there for a full day. He answered question after \nquestion. He answered followup questions, written questions. He \nanswered the questions.\n  Again, it is important to remember the circumstances under which this \nhearing took place. That hearing was held September 26, 2001, chaired \nby my Democratic friend, the senior Senator from New York, with whom I \nwent to grade school and high school in Brooklyn. Both Democratic and \nRepublican Senators asked scores of questions, which Mr. Estrada \nanswered. If any Senator was unsatisfied with Mr. Estrada's answers, \nevery member of the committee had an opportunity to ask Mr. Estrada \nfollowup questions. I believe only two of my Democratic colleagues did \nthat.\n  A number of questions that Mr. Estrada was asked directly or \nindirectly tried to pry from him a commitment on how he would rule on a \nparticular case. Previous judicial nominees who were confirmed by the \nSenate have rightly declined to answer questions on that basis, as Mr. \nEstrada did. Let me give you some examples.\n\n  In 1967, during his confirmation hearing for the Supreme Court, \nJustice Thurgood Marshall responded to a question about the fifth \namendment by stating:\n\n       I do not think you want me to be in a position of giving \n     you a statement on the Fifth Amendment and then, if I am \n     confirmed and sit on the Court, when a Fifth Amendment case \n     comes up, I will have to disqualify myself.\n\n  If I may digress, one of the other charges against Mr. Estrada is \nthat he did not have judicial experience. During the course of this \ndebate, it has been highlighted again and again that many distinguished \njudges--Supreme Court Judges and circuit court judges--did not have \njudicial experience before they were appointed to the court. Mr. \nEstrada, in fact, clerked for both a Federal court judge and U.S. \nSupreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy. When Thurgood Marshall was \nappointed, I believe, to the District Court of Appeals, he did not have \nprior judicial experience. I think it was Justice Holmes who did not \nhave it. I could go on and on. So that charge, too, is pure bunk.\n  During Sandra Day O'Connor's confirmation hearing, the Senator from \nMassachusetts, the former chairman of the Judiciary Committee, defended \nher refusal to discuss her views on abortion. He said:\n\n       It is offensive to suggest that a potential justice of the \n     Supreme Court must pass a presumed test of judicial \n     philosophy. It is even more offensive to suggest that a \n     potential justice must pass the litmus test of any single-\n     issue interest group.\n\n  It is interesting, if you look at Mr. Estrada's response on the \nquestion of Roe v. Wade, he said very clearly in response to a question \nof the Senator from California that he has his views, but his view of \nthe judicial function ``does not allow me to answer that question.'' \nBut he said he has a personal view on the subject. Again, he goes back \nto his view of judicial function. Then he goes on to say:\n\n       And the reason I have not done any of those things is that \n     I view a system of law in which me as an advocate and \n     possibly if I am confirmed as a judge, have the job of \n     building on the wall that is already there, not to call it \n     into question. I have no particular reason to go back and \n     look at whether that decision was right or wrong as a matter \n     of law, as I would if I were a judge that was hearing the \n     case for the first time.\n\n\n[[Page S2777]]\n\n\n  Then he goes on to say:\n\n       It is there. It is the law and it has subsequently been \n     refined by the Casey case, and I will follow it.\n\n  The Senator from California asked:\n\n       Do you believe it is settled law?\n\n  The answer is:\n\n       I believe so.\n\n  So again, he has done what other nominees have done and he will not \ndiscuss his personal feelings. He will not discuss his personal \nphilosophy on that issue, but he says it is settled law--settled law.\n  Likewise, Justice John Paul Stevens testified during his confirmation \nhearing:\n\n       I really don't think I should discuss this subject \n     generally, Senator. I don't mean to be unresponsive, but in \n     all candor, I must say there have been many times in my \n     experience in the past 5 years when I found that my first \n     reaction to a problem was not the same as the reaction I had \n     when I had the responsibility of decisions, and I think if I \n     were to make comments not carefully thought through, they \n     might be given significance they really did not merit.\n\n  Justice Sandra Day O'Connor was confirmed. Justice John Paul Stevens \nwas confirmed.\n  Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg also declined to answer certain \nquestions, stating:\n\n       Because I am and hope to continue to be a judge, it would \n     be wrong for me to say or to preview in this legislative \n     chamber how I would cast my vote on questions before the \n     Supreme Court. Were I to rehearse here what I would say or \n     how I would reason on such questions, I would act \n     injudiciously.\n\n  In addition, as my colleague from Nevada yesterday noted, Justice \nGinsburg just last year said in dissent in the case of Republican Party \nof Minnesota v. White:\n\n       In the context of the Federal system, how a prospective \n     nominee for the bench would resolve certain particular \n     contentious issues would certainly be ``of interest'' to the \n     President and the Senate. . . .But in accord with a \n     longstanding norm, every Member of this Court declined to \n     furnish such information to the Senate and presumably to the \n     President as well.\n\n  I believe I recall in reviewing the transcripts of the hearing of Mr. \nEstrada--I am not a member of that committee, but I have taken the time \nto review some of the transcripts--he was asked by one of my \ndistinguished colleagues on the other side of the aisle whether he was \na strict constructionist. I believe his response was he was a fair \nconstructionist.\n  A further discourse by my distinguished colleague from the other side \nof the aisle, I think from North Carolina: Did the President talk about \nstrict constructionist? I am paraphrasing. Mr. Estrada came back and \nsaid: I did not talk about that with the President, but he talks about \nbeing a fair constructionist.\n  That is the kind of judge the people of the United States want to sit \non the Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  I also note, in contrast to the characterization of my colleague from \nNevada, however, Justice Scalia in his majority opinion did not take \nissue with that description, as Mr. Gonzales pointed out in his letter. \nJustice Scalia said:\n\n       Nor do we assert that candidates for judicial office should \n     be compelled to announce their views on disputed legal \n     issues.\n\n  Like these previous nominees, all of whom the Senate confirmed, Mr. \nEstrada refused to violate the code of ethics for judicial nominees by \ndeclining to give answers that would appear to commit him on issues \nthat he would be called upon to decide as a judge. Again and again, he \nprovided answers in direct response to questions that make his judicial \nphilosophy an open book.\n  Let me share some specific examples. Responding to a question to \nidentify the most important attribute of a judge, Mr. Estrada answered \nthat it was to have an appropriate process for decisionmaking. That, he \nsaid, entails having an open mind, listening to the parties, reading \ntheir briefs, doing all the legwork on the law and facts, engaging in \ndeliberation with colleagues, and being committed to judging, as a \nprocess that is intended to give the right answer.\n\n  These are not extreme views. I do not think we could ask any more \nfrom any judge.\n  When asked about the appropriate temperament of a judge, he responded \nthat a judge should be impartial, openminded, and unbiased, courteous, \nyet firm, and one who will give ear to people who come into his \ncourtroom. These are the qualities of Miguel Estrada. He testified that \nhe is and would continue to be the type of person who listens with both \nears and would be fair to all litigants. Again, that phrase he used, he \nwould be a fair constructionist.\n  Mr. Estrada was asked a number of questions about his views and \nphilosophy on following legal precedent. Let me highlight a bit of that \nexchange.\n  Question:\n\n       Are you committed to following the precedents of higher \n     courts faithfully and giving them full force and effect even \n     if you disagree with such precedents?\n\n  Answer:\n\n       Absolutely, Senator.\n\n  Question:\n\n       What would you do if you believe the Supreme Court or the \n     Court of Appeals had seriously erred in rendering decision? \n     Would you apply that decision or use your own judgment of the \n     merits, or the best judgment of the merits?\n\n  Answer:\n\n       My duty as a judge and my inclination as a person and as a \n     lawyer of integrity would be to follow the orders of the \n     higher court.\n\n  Question:\n\n       And if there were no controlling precedent dispositively \n     concluding an issue with which you were presented in your \n     circuit, to what sources would you turn to for persuasive \n     authority?\n\n  Answer:\n\n       In such a circumstance, my cardinal rule would be to seize \n     aid from any place where I could get it--related case law, \n     legislative history, custom and practice, and views of \n     academics on analysis of law.\n\n  That is the kind of judge we want. That is the kind of judge I think \nthe Constitution intended us to have when it gave us this solemn \nresponsibility of advising and consenting on judicial nominations. \nAgain, not by changing the constitutional standard, but advising and \nconsenting, allowing a majority of Senators in the Senate to advise and \nthen consent on a nominee presented by the President but not requiring \na supermajority.\n  These exchanges I have laid out clearly illustrate Miguel Estrada's \nrespect for law and his willingness and ability to faithfully follow \nthe law.\n  He further testified, in response to other questions:\n\n       I will follow binding case law in every case. Even in \n     accordance with the case law that is not binding, but seems \n     instructive on the area, without any influence whatsoever \n     from any personal view I may have about the subject matter.\n\n  This is what we expect judges to do. I can see no good reason why \nanyone would be opposed to a nominee who promised to follow the law, a \nnominee who is highly qualified, a nominee who the American Bar \nAssociation in rating judges gave a unanimous--every person on the \ncommittee, and I presume they were not all conservative Republicans, \nevery person on that review committee unanimously gave him the highest \nrating, the highest recommendation, which many of my distinguished \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle have called the gold \nstandard. That is the way in which we should measure judges.\n\n  Now we have a judge in front of them who has passed the gold standard \nunanimously, who is highly educated, who at 17 years of age came to \nthis country from Honduras and did not speak English well, graduated \nmagna cum laude from Columbia, graduated magna cum laude from Harvard \nLaw School, was editor of the Law Review, clerked for Federal and \nSupreme Court judges, worked, and came back to public service. Talk \nabout the American dream.\n  Miguel Estrada, being given such great opportunity of education, is \ncoming back and saying: I am going to give back to the community; I \nwant to work in public service.\n  I had the chance to serve as solicitor general of the State of \nMinnesota. It is a solemn, high honor to represent your State or to \nrepresent your country, to work for your State or your country, to \nuphold its constitution.\n  It is important to note that every living former Solicitor General of \nthe United States, four of whom are Democrats, stand with Miguel \nEstrada on one of the other issues that my distinguished colleagues \nfrom the other side have raised. They said they want some of his \nopinion papers. Yet Democrat Solicitors General--every one of them--\nsay, no, that is not appropriate;\n\n[[Page S2778]]\n\nthose should not be given up. That is not Miguel Estrada saying that. \nThose are the Solicitors General of the United States. Again, that is \nanother argument that is a bogus argument, if I may be blunt.\n  When asked about the role of political ideology in the legal process, \nMr. Estrada replied with a response that, in my view, was entirely \nappropriate and within the mainstream of what all Americans expect from \ntheir judiciary. He said:\n\n       [A]lthough we all have views on a number of subjects from A \n     to Z, the first duty of a judge is to self-consciously put \n     that aside and look at each case with an open mind and listen \n     to the parties. And, to the best of his human capacity, to \n     give judgment based solely on the arguments of law. I think \n     my basic idea of judging is to do it on the basis of law and \n     to put aside whatever view I might have on the subject to the \n     maximum extent possible.\n\n  When asked about his views on interpreting the Constitution, Mr. \nEstrada was forthright and complete in his responses. For example, in \nexchange regarding the literal interpretation of the words of the \nConstitution, Mr. Estrada responded:\n\n       I recognize that the Supreme Court has said on numerous \n     occasions in the area of privacy and elsewhere that there are \n     unenumerated rights in the Constitution. And I have no view \n     of any sort, whether legal or personal, that would hinder me \n     from applying those rulings by the Court. But I think the \n     Court has been quite clear that there are enumerated rights \n     in the Constitution. In the main, the Court has recognized \n     them as being inherent in the right of substantive due \n     process and the liberty clause of the fourteenth amendment.\n\n  Mr. Estrada was asked questions about the appropriate balance between \nCongress and the courts. His answers made clear his view that judges \nmust review challenges to the statutes with a strong presumption of the \nstatute's constitutionality. For example, in responding to a question \nabout environmental protection statutes, he stated:\n\n       Congress has passed a number of statutes that try to \n     safeguard the environment. I think all judges would have to \n     greet those statutes when they come to the court with a \n     strong presumption of constitutionality.\n\n  At the same time, he recognized that as a circuit court judge he \nwould be bound to follow the precedent established by Lopez and other \nSupreme Court cases. So it is clear from the record that Mr. Estrada \ndid answer the questions put to him at his hearing.\n  His judicial philosophy is an open book. But if my Democratic \ncolleagues are still inclined to vote against him, misguided as I \nbelieve that choice to be, then they should have that right. Let them \nvote against him. Vote for him, vote against him. Do what their \nconscience dictates. Just vote. Do not change that magnificent, most \nwonderful constitutional standard that has guided us and kept this \ncountry together for over 200 years. Allow the Senate to exercise its \nduty. Allow each Member to vote their conscience. Just vote and end \nthis filibuster.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I take this opportunity to address the \nEstrada nomination and a couple of other issues that the people in my \nState care a lot about.\n  Before he leaves, I wanted to say to my friend from Minnesota that I \nknow he was not in the Senate during the last filibuster on the court \nnominee--actually, there were two including the Abe Fortas nomination \nin the 1960s--and they occurred in the year 2000. They were launched by \nMembers of the Republican side of the aisle, and they were directed at \na woman named Marcia Berzon and a man named Richard Paez.\n  In addition to the filibuster----\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Madam President, will the Senator from California yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER [continuing]. There was actually a vote to indefinitely \npostpone one of those nominees, the Hispanic nominee, Richard Paez.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Madam President, will the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia yield for a question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would be delighted to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. I ask the distinguished Senator from California, is it \nnot true that in those instances when she talks about ``filibusters''--\nand I was not here, but I understand that those ``filibusters'' did not \nlast more than a day or two--that in fact both of those nominees had a \nchance to be voted on by this body. Is that true?\n  Mrs. BOXER. My friend is incorrect. Here is what happened. It took 4 \nyears, I say to my colleague, to get the Republicans to bring the \nnomination of Richard Paez to the floor of this Senate. How do I know? \nBecause I had recommended Judge Paez first for the district court, \nwhere he got immediate approval.\n  I would like to answer my friend before I yield, and I will be glad \nto yield to my friend all night long, believe me, if he wants to stay \nand engage. So relax and we will get to his questions.\n  My friend was not here. It took 4 long years to get the Republicans \nto relent. This is Republicans, the Senator's party, who voted to seat \nhim on the district court unanimously. When he was nominated for the \ncircuit court, it took 4 years. There was extensive questioning back \nand forth, written questions, oral questions. Then there was a \nfilibuster. My friend says it only lasted 2 days. It was 4 years and 2 \ndays.\n  I say to my friend, the only reason in the world that filibuster was \nended is because we had the votes to stop it. The Senator does not have \nthe votes to stop this filibuster. If he did, it could be done in a \nminute. The reason there are not the votes is because this man will not \nanswer questions, despite the fact that my friend read some answers. I \nhave a lot of other things to put in the Record tonight that will \nchallenge that.\n  Before he leaves, I say to my friend, in answer to his question and \nbefore I yield further, this was a clear filibuster. I am going to give \na quote.\n\n       I must confess to being somewhat baffled that after a \n     filibuster is cut off by cloture the Senate could still delay \n     a final vote on the nomination.\n\n  I say to my friend, who called what happened to Richard Paez a \nfilibuster? None other than the Senator's chairman, Orrin Hatch. It is \nin the Congressional Record.\n  I am glad to yield to my friend for a further question.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Madam President, I ask the distinguished colleague from \nCalifornia again, in both instances is it not true that cloture was \nfiled--we are talking about filibuster, not 4 years but filibuster \ndebate on this floor--and both nominees were confirmed after cloture \nwas invoked?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to my friend, the day this nomination was brought \nto the floor, the Republican side could have filed cloture, just as we \ndid, but they are choosing not to do it. There can be a vote on cloture \ntoday. It could be tomorrow.\n  Not only that, when this man answers questions, the vote is going to \nbe won. The Senator is going to have his vote.\n  I have been around a long time in public life, 10 years in the House, \nand 10 years in the Senate. I have never seen such a systematic plan \nnot to answer basic questions. Can anyone imagine a man who cannot \nanswer a question if there was ever a Supreme Court case that he \ndisagreed with? I daresay I do not know anyone in the country, lawyer \nor not, who agrees with the Dred Scott decision. I do not know any \nperson who is willing to say now that he believes separate but equal, \nPlessey v. Ferguson, was rightly decided.\n  This man cannot even say which Justice, dead or alive, he would \nemulate most. It is unbelievable. Except when it is put in the context \nof who was advising this man, and we have seen it time and again on the \nfloor. They basically said: Do not answer any questions. This is a \nlifetime appointment. Do not blow it.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Madam President, will the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia yield for two more questions?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Absolutely.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Is it not true the Republicans filed cloture for both of \nthe distinguished judges my colleague from California has mentioned, \nboth Judge Paez and Judge Berzon? Secondly, if that is true, I ask my \ndistinguished colleague from California if she would vote for cloture \nand support putting an end to this filibuster on the nomination of \nMiguel Estrada.\n  Mrs. BOXER. The bottom line is who can file cloture? The Democrats \ncan file cloture on this nomination. The question is, Was there a \nfilibuster? My friend stood up and said there has been no filibuster \nsince Abe Fortas in the\n\n[[Page S2779]]\n\n1960s, when his own chairman, Orrin Hatch said:\n\n       I must confess to be somewhat baffled that after a \n     filibuster is cut off by cloture the Senate can still delay a \n     final vote on the nomination.\n\n  By the way, there was a filibuster on Marsha Berzon. My friend ought \nto know, in addition to the filibuster, after we had won the cloture \nvote on the Paez nomination, there was an incredible motion filed to \nindefinitely postpone the vote on the nomination. Imagine, there is \nthis fight; it lasted 4 years and several days on a filibuster. We win \nthis, we get the votes, and then there is a motion from a Republican to \nindefinitely delay the vote, and even Senator Hatch was stunned. He \nsaid he was baffled that could even happen.\n  So for the Senator to say there has not been a filibuster since the \n1960s on a judge is false. His own chairman admitted there was a \nfilibuster.\n  Not only did his side launch a filibuster--my friend was not here; I \ndon't mean to take it out on you--but as someone who knew how fine \nthese two nominees were, they faced that filibuster. They answered the \nquestions over and over again and finally got a vote.\n  That is the system here. It is misleading to the American public to \nhear this day in and day out. ``This is unprecedented to have a \nfilibuster.'' What is unprecedented is that we have the votes to keep \nit going. You did not have the votes on your side to keep it going.\n  If my friend has no further questions, I will return to my original \nstatement.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Madam President, I have no further questions for my \ndistinguished colleague from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend.\n  The point I make tonight, among several, is that we have been \ncharged--those who want more answers from Miguel Estrada--with doing \nsomething that has never been done before when, in fact, in the year \n2000, two nominees to the Ninth Circuit Court were filibustered and one \nof the two was not only filibustered, but after he won cloture there \nwas a motion to indefinitely postpone the actual vote on his \nnomination. I had never seen that. I hope I never see it again. The \nfact is, there have been two filibusters led by Republican Members and \nthose were defeated.\n  The second fact is that one of those particular individuals was the \nfirst Mexican American to serve on the Central District Court of \nCalifornia and the Republicans held him up for 4 years before we were \nable to break the filibuster.\n  It was quite a situation. My friend from Minnesota said--I don't want \nto misquote him--something like ``the judicial philosophy of this \nnominee is an open book,'' I think is what he said. It may be an open \nbook, but it looks like this. This is the book. There is nothing on it.\n  When a candidate cannot say if there was ever a Supreme Court case \nwith which they disagreed, this is going above and beyond stonewalling; \nor cannot say what Justice, dead or alive, he would emulate most, this \nis beyond stonewalling.\n  In my State we are very fortunate. We have reached agreement with \nRepublicans in our State. We have a wonderful selection process for \njudicial nominees for the district court. Those individuals come before \nus and are screened by a joint committee. It is a great process. They \nanswer questions. There are votes taken. Then Senator Feinstein and I \nmake a recommendation. It is a bipartisan process.\n  This is the point: It is working. And it is a participatory process \nfrom both parties and both branches of government. I believe questions \nought to be asked and answered and Senators have a right to ask \nquestions and Senators have a right to have those questions answered. \nIt is pretty simple.\n  I started to talk about Judge Paez who made history as a Hispanic \nbecause I wanted to make the point for the Senate that he was treated \nin a way that was totally outrageous, having to wait 4 years to get a \nvote. He hung on because of his true grit--hearing after hearing; 7 \nmonths his nomination languished in 1998. The Republican majority \nrefused to bring him up for a vote. All we were asking for was a vote. \nAnd we were refused.\n  In 1999, Judge Paez was nominated for the third time, and 6 months \nlater the Judiciary Committee approved his nomination, but again we \ncould not get the nomination up for a vote. Finally, when the \nnomination was brought up after more than 1,500 days, it was \nfilibustered.\n\n  My colleagues say again and again it was not. Senator Hatch, the \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, said it and it is in the \nCongressional Record. This was a filibuster. We had to get cloture. \nWhen you have to get cloture, there is a filibuster. That is as simple \nas it is. We had to get 60 votes.\n  If my Republican friends want to end this, tell the nominee to answer \nthe questions. And believe me, he will get an up-or-down vote and the \nchips will fall where they fall.\n  It is very clear to me when I look at the way Judge Paez was treated, \nMarsha Berzon, Margaret Morrow, and a whole slew of others who were \nnominated and eventually confirmed, they had to answer question after \nquestion after question. I will get to that in a minute, the type of \nquestions that Margaret Morrow had to answer just to become a district \ncourt judge.\n  Let's go to the floor of the Senate and take you back to the year \n2000 to this filibuster against Marsha Berzon and against Judge Paez. \nLet me quote Senator Smith, that is Bob Smith, of New Hampshire, then \nSenator: ``it is no secret that I have been the person who has \nfilibustered these two nominations, Judge Berzon and Judge Paez.''\n  And he goes on to say: ``So don't tell me we haven't filibustered \njudges and that we don't have the right to filibuster judges on the \nfloor of the Senate. Of course we do. That is our constitutional \nrole.''\n  This is a Republican, leading the filibuster, against Clinton \nnominees for the circuit court. He says: ``don't criticize our right to \ndo these things and don't say things didn't happen that did happen.''\n  And he goes on, more Bob Smith, Republican from New Hampshire, one of \nthe leaders of the filibuster, along with Senator Allard, Senator \nBrownback, Senator Bunning, Senator Craig, Senators DeWine, Enzi, \nFrist, Graham, Helms, Hutchinson, Inhofe, Murkowski, and Shelby. And \nBob Smith said:\n\n       Don't come here on the floor and tell me that if I want to \n     block Judge Paez or Judge Berzon, somehow I'm going down some \n     new path. I am not going down any new path. I am following \n     the tradition and precedent of this Senate.\n\n  That was Republican Bob Smith, one of the leaders of the filibuster, \nagainst two judges, one Hispanic, nominated by President Bill Clinton \nfor the Ninth Circuit Court.\n  Senator Bob Smith continues:\n\n       We have a responsibility to make darn sure these judges are \n     going to represent the views of the majority of the American \n     people in terms of the law. I intend to do that as long as I \n     can stand here to do it.\n\n  And the Republican Bob Smith continues, one of the leaders of the \nfilibuster, against Hispanic judge Richard Paez. It took him 4 years to \nget a vote. Bob Smith, Republican:\n\n       When a nominee has some controversy about him or her, if it \n     gets to the floor, there are normally quite a few \n     discussions; i.e., a filibuster.\n\n  Now this goes on. I am shocked that my friends on the other side of \nthe aisle didn't read recent history--in the year 2000. Here it goes \non. What were the reasons for the filibuster? According to Senator \nSmith, it was because--what? He didn't get answers to questions.\n  Let me quote former Senator Smith again, leading a filibuster against \na Hispanic judge and Marsha Berzon, two qualified appointees. They got \nthe top rating. They were put up by Bill Clinton.\n\n       I think those questions ought to be answered. I think we \n     should know the answers to those questions about what \n     happened before we put this person on the circuit court.\n\n  Let me say that again. A Republican colleague of yours, that side of \nthe aisle, leading the charge against these Clinton nominees, leading a \nfilibuster:\n\n       I think those questions ought to be answered. I think we \n     should know the answers to those questions about what \n     happened before we put this person on the circuit court.\n\n  More quotes from Bob Smith, in the Congressional Record:\n\n       Filibuster in the Senate has a purpose. It is not simply to \n     delay for the sake of delay. It is to get information.\n\n  It is to get information. And do you know what? I disagreed with the \nfilibuster that was led then. It went on\n\n[[Page S2780]]\n\nand on until they didn't have the votes anymore and we had the votes. \nYou could say: What goes around comes around.\n  Senators on the other side of the aisle launched a filibuster against \ntwo of President Clinton's nominees for the Ninth Circuit Court, with \nthe highest qualifications, and there were those on the other side of \nthe aisle who believed they didn't answer questions. They launched a \nfilibuster on that ground, and we had to get the votes. And you have to \nget the votes. That is the way it is here.\n  We were able to get the votes because--guess what--our nominees \nanswered the questions. They answered the questions, every question. I \nhad worked to help get Margaret Morrow to a district court judgeship. I \nwant to tell you, Margaret Morrow waited 2 to 3 years to get a vote for \ndistrict court. Do you know what she was asked? She was asked a \nquestion that was so abhorrent, I could not believe it. She was asked \nby one of the Senators on the Republican side of the aisle how she \nvoted for the last 10 years on referenda that were on the ballot in \nCalifornia.\n  Madam President, I know you are not an expert on California. I can \ntell you, there were hundreds and hundreds of these referenda, and they \nwere on some tough issues for everything you can imagine.\n  No. 1, I always thought this was a secret ballot. When you go in the \nvoting booth it is between you and yourself; you are going to decide \nthese issues. That is No. 1.\n  No. 2, this was an impossible request. How could you even remember \nall these issues, how you voted on them?\n  So we went to this particular Senator and said: Senator, this is not \nfair. This is a secret ballot--please. But he wouldn't relent. But he \nrelented to this degree. He said: OK, we won't go back 10 years, just \ngive us the 10 most controversial votes.\n  She did. She did. She respected the process enough, she even went so \nfar as to answer those questions which, in my opinion--I don't know \nwhat I personally would have done. I truly don't know. But I know I \ntold her, if she felt she could do it, do it, because a Senator was \nasking.\n\n  That is an amazing comparison, compared to: Can you name any Supreme \nCourt Justice who would emulate or any Supreme Court case that you \ndisagree with? Those are conventional questions asked over and over \nagain.\n  As far as memoranda from the Solicitor General's Office are \nconcerned, there is precedent for that. There is precedent for that. I \nwill give you the people who turned over these previously confidential \ninternal documents. I give the names for the record: Robert Bork, \nWilliam Bradford Reynolds, Benjamin Civiletti, Stephen Trott, Judge \nWilliam Rehnquist. These people turned over previously confidential \ninternal documents. Do you know why? I think they respected the Senate \nenough to say: Do you know what? I could just argue legalese with you, \nbut you have a very important job of advice and consent, and we are \nwilling to give you these memoranda. So there is precedent for that.\n  I am stunned. We went through the Record and my staff pointed out the \ncomments that were made on this floor by Senators over and over again, \nreferring to the fact that they were filibustering Judge Paez, they \nwere filibustering Marsha Berzon. And then to hear there hasn't been a \nfilibuster here since the 1960's--I don't know what to say. It is \nstunning to me.\n  The fact that we beat it back, that means it is not a filibuster? You \nget the votes, you beat it back; is it then not going to be a \nfilibuster? I have taken to the floor tonight because I am incredulous \non the point. After seeing these words in the Record myself, with my \nown eyes, after hearing Senator Hatch, who is leading the charge and \ntelling us this is unprecedented, what we are doing, this is unfair to \nsomeone, he himself referring to what happened to Richard Paez as a \nfilibuster.\n  Bob Smith not only referred to it as a filibuster that he was \nactually leading, but that he was leading in order to get information. \nYou could say we took a page out of the book of the Republicans. We \ndidn't. Because we are willing to say we will vote for cloture when he \nturns over the information. I never heard, frankly, any of them at that \ntime say they were willing to allow a vote if there were more questions \nanswered because, frankly, every question was answered that you could \ncome up with. There wasn't anything else you could know about those \nnominees--what they thought, or what they dreamed about, or what they \nwanted to do, or what they believed, or whom they admired, or what \nmeetings they went to. It was extraordinary.\n  I think it was Marsha Berzon who was asked the question--she was on \nthe board of an organization. They said to her: We want to know \neverything that happened at every meeting of that organization, whether \nyou went to the meeting or not.\n  It took her hours. Why? She respected the role of the Senate to \nadvise and consent. It is in the Constitution, and she understood that, \nand Miguel Estrada should understand that. I don't care who trained him \nnot to say anything. We have those quotes all over the place. I have \nseen one saying: Don't answer any of these questions; this is a \nlifetime opportunity; don't let them see who you are. He was trained \nnot to answer questions.\n  He ought to respect the Senate. I know the members of the Judiciary \nCommittee on our side of the aisle, and I know the members on the other \nside. I know they work hard. They have a lot of pressure on them on \nboth sides. When my colleagues tell me they were stunned at the \nstonewalling they received, I believe them because, by the way, I read \nsome of the answers Miguel Estrada put into the record. I will give you \nquestions and answers here. These are questions asked by Senator \nSchumer:\n  Question:\n\n       Other than cases in which you were an advocate, please tell \n     us of three cases from the last 40 years of Supreme Court \n     jurisprudence you are most critical of.\n\n  Answer:\n\n       I'm not even sure that I could think of three that I would \n     be--that I would have a sort of adverse reaction to, if \n     that's what you are getting at.\n\n  Question:\n\n       So, with all of your legal background and your immersion in \n     the legal world, you can't think of three, or even one single \n     case that the Supreme Court has decided that you disagree \n     with?\n\n  Answer:\n\n       I don't know that I'm in a position to say that I disagree \n     with any case that the Supreme Court has ever ruled on or \n     that I think the court got it right.\n\n  Question:\n\n       I'm not asking how you approach cases. That's a legitimate \n     question and some have asked it. I want to know how you feel \n     about cases. And you have said more broadly than any other \n     witness I have come across--you have given us virtually no \n     opinion on anything because it might come up in the future.\n  Answer:\n\n       But the problem is the same, Senator Schumer, because \n     taking case A and looking at whether the court got it right \n     or whether I think they got it right I have only the benefit \n     of the opinions. I haven't seen the litigants.\n\n  The litigants have been dead for a long time in Dred Scott. But, for \nGod's sake, we ought to know. You can't say that slavery is wrong; that \nyou disagree with that decision? You can't say separate but equal was \nwrong because you didn't know the litigants?\n  Where are we? I am stunned.\n  He said the case is ruled on but he didn't get to see what made it \ninto the opinion.\n  This is outrageous. He didn't see what made it into the opinion; the \ncourt ruled that slavery was constitutional and he didn't disagree with \nit? He has to meet the litigants? I am stunned.\n  The Senate has a very sacred job. It is in the Constitution. It \ndoesn't say roll over and play dead when a President picks a nominee to \na court. In fact, the Founders disagreed over who should have the \nresponsibility to choose justices. And they came out with this very \nbalanced decision of equal power. Presidents do not like that. I can \ntell you. I don't know one President who likes the fact we have this \nadvise and consent role. It is very annoying to the executive branch \nthat we are here. I don't care whether they are Democrats and \nRepublicans.\n  I say that when our constituents sent us here they want us to do the \njob we swear to do. We hold up our hand here on the Bible and swear to \nuphold the Constitution. The Constitution says advise and consent on \njudicial nominees.\n\n[[Page S2781]]\n\n  It doesn't say roll over and play dead. It doesn't say, oh, give them \na break. It doesn't say that. We have a lot of other things to do. It \ndoesn't say that. It says the Senate shall advise and consent.\n  At home in California, the way people pick district court nominees, \nit is true--we advise and consent. I have to say there are a lot of \npeople who do not like it. Some conservative groups in California are \nsaying they do not like the way we are doing it. But it is fair. We are \nappointing moderate Republican judges to the district bench. That is \nthe way the President said he wanted to do it. We are able to do it \nbecause in our State we have an agreement where Democrats and \nRepublicans sit side by side and choose. We have two Democratic \nSenators. That is why this happens.\n  But if the President is going to send us judicial nominees who won't \nanswer questions, he is not going to get very far. It isn't going to \nwork. Frankly, from my perspective, if people are off the charts on the \nright wing, I am not going to vote for them. I will not filibuster \nthem. Once they give us the information, I am ready to vote. I will \nretain my right for a Supreme Court Justice, however, on that point on \nthe filibuster. But, in general, if people answer questions, I will \nvote no. But I want the answers. I don't want a judicial selection \nprocess that excludes the Senate. It is the worst thing that can happen \nin this country.\n  If you look around, it is the courts that have stood up for the \nrights of our people--free speech, freedom of religion, freedom of the \npress, civil rights, human rights, environmental rights, so many rights \nthat we hold dear, and the right to choose.\n  Madam President, you and I have worked hard on that. If we didn't \nhave a court that found in the early stages of a pregnancy a woman has \nthe right to choose, I don't even know where we would be for women. The \ncourts have held the line. We know it is very shaky right now.\n\n  The courts play a very important role. It is part of the check and \nbalance in our society. It seems to me, if we think that we don't have \nenough information and just sit back and say it would be a lot easier \nto let it go, I will vote no to let it go. I don't think that is right \nfor those who come here.\n  Bob Smith, a Republican from New Hampshire, said he didn't have \nenough information. I disagreed with him. We beat him on the \nfilibuster. But there was a filibuster. I think recent history is \nshowing us that there is precedent for asking the important questions.\n  I wish to say one more thing about the Paez nomination. After we won \non the filibuster of both Marsha Berzon and Richard Paez, there was a \nmotion made by a Republican Senator to indefinitely postpone the final \nvote on one of the two, the Hispanic, Richard Paez. It was stunning. It \nwas unprecedented.\n  Let me make a statement. I believe it is a precedent that never \nshould be occurring here again because the whole purpose of a \nfilibuster is to determine whether you are going to move ahead on a \nvote. Once there is no filibuster, you have to have a vote. Then we had \nthis intervening motion about indefinitely postponing the vote. It just \nundercuts what cloture is supposed to be about. I thought that was \nunbelievable.\n  Basically a Senator wanted to kill the nomination even after we had \nwon cloture. That was so unprecedented that Senator Hatch himself said \nhe had never seen it. He had never heard of it, and he was perplexed. \nHe was baffled by it.\n  Let me quote Senator Sessions who moved to stop the final vote on \nthis Hispanic Judge, Richard Paez, after we won cloture. He said:\n\n       I move in a postcloture environment to postpone \n     indefinitely the nomination of Richard Paez--\n\n  Listen to this--\n\n     in order for this body to get the answers I believe every \n     Senator deserves with regard to the concerns I have raised \n     about Judge Paez over the last several days.\n\n  On Judge Paez, because this Senator thought he didn't have the \ninformation after 4 years, after pages of questions, after cloture was \ninvoked then he did something unprecedented and moved to indefinitely \npostpone the final vote.\n  At that time, Senator Hatch was perplexed. I was certainly perplexed. \nColleagues were amazed. And here is in full what Senator Hatch said at \nthat time.\n\n       I have served a number of years in the Senate, and I have \n     never seen a ``motion to postpone indefinitely'' that was \n     brought to delay the consideration of a judicial nomination \n     post-cloture. Indeed, I must confess to being somewhat \n     baffled that, after the filibuster is cut off by cloture, the \n     Senate could still delay a final vote on a nomination.\n\n  Senator Hatch was right on the point. He called the filibuster a \nfilibuster at that time. He was baffled by the kind of a \npostfilibuster-filibuster in the guise of postponing the final vote. \nClearly, we had to get the votes for Judge Paez, and we did. And he is \nserving and doing us all proud, I might say, on the Ninth Circuit right \nnow.\n\n\n                                  Iraq\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I have a couple of things to say about \nanother subject in a brief period. It has to do with the issue of Iraq.\n  I spent a week during the last break in California and doing several \nevents--many events, doing the normal things you do when you go home; \ngoing shopping, taking a walk in the park and around the neighborhood. \nI don't think I have ever seen my people in California as distressed \nand on edge and anxious as they are at this particular point in our \nhistory.\n  I want to tell you that this cuts across party lines.\n  As a matter of fact, there was a poll in the paper today about the \nviews of Californians very much concerned about going to war. My \nconstituents are saying: Senator, is there any way in your mind that \nthe President will not take this country into war? And my answer--\nbecause I am searching for it; the President says he has not made a \ndecision--but to be as honest as I can, I say: Here is what I think on \nthat matter. If the true goal is to disarm Saddam Hussein and Iraq, \nthen there is a chance that this could be resolved short of war. But if \nthe true desire is to replace Saddam Hussein, have a regime change, \nunless Saddam Hussein agrees to go--which would be a wonderful \nprospect--I do not see how you get there.\n  The people in my State are very concerned.\n  Then they say: Well, Senator, do inspections really work? And I tell \nthem that the facts are out there, that in fact there were more weapons \nof mass destruction dismantled after the gulf war than there were by \nour bombs.\n  I asked for the list of weapons of mass destruction that were in fact \ndestroyed after the Gulf war. I am going to read the list of weapons \nthat were destroyed during the inspections.\n  In the missile area: 48 operational long-range missiles, 14 \nconventional missile warheads, 6 operational mobile launchers, 28 \noperational fixed launchpads, 32 fixed launchpads under construction, \n30 missile chemical warheads, other missile support equipment and \nmateriel, supervision of the destruction of a variety of assembled and \nnonassembled supergun components.\n  In the chemical area: 38,537 filled and empty chemical munitions were \ndestroyed by the inspectors, 690 tons of chemical weapons agent, more \nthan 3,000 tons of precursor chemicals, 426 pieces of chemical weapons \nproduction equipment, 91 pieces of related analytical instruments.\n  In the biological area: an entire biological weapons production \nfacility called Al-Hakam, a variety of biological weapons production \nequipment and materiel.\n  So the fact is, the inspectors discovered and dismantled more weapons \nof mass destruction than were in fact destroyed by our bombs.\n  Sadly, there was a period where there were no inspectors in Iraq. And \nI do not trust, for a minute, that Iraq did not start to rebuild these \nstocks. The fact is, Saddam Hussein must be disarmed. That is why I \nsupported the Levin resolution that said he must be disarmed--but not \nfor us to go it alone, without the world with us, as the world was with \nus in the first gulf war.\n  My constituents are coming up to me and saying: What happened here? \nEverything feels out of control. Why? The world isn't even with us \nanymore. We are having fights and sniping with our allies. What \nhappened?\n  I started to think about that. And I will never forget--none of us \nwill ever forget where we were on 9/11, when we were attacked by al-\nQaida. Osama bin Laden, remember his name? He attacked us. He hurt us \non our own\n\n[[Page S2782]]\n\nshores. I will never forget that. And I will never forget, on 9/12, \nthat the whole world was with us.\n\n  There is a song called ``He Has the Whole World in His Hands.'' It is \na beautiful song. President Bush had the whole world in his hands on 9/\n12. Countries around the world--every one of them; even some that we \nreally do not have such a close relationship with--expressed that they \nwere with us. We had the world in our hands. Yes, we were the leader of \nthe free world before 9/11, but on 9/12 the world was so with us and \nagainst terror. And somehow, some way, this has been squandered. This \nhas been squandered. There has been this intensity on Iraq and what I \ncall a designed neglect of the rest of the world.\n  Even in our own hemisphere, we see what is happening in Colombia, in \nVenezuela. I met with the Mexican Foreign Minister, I say to my friend \nfrom Nevada, who has a good-sized Hispanic population in his State. And \nthe Mexican Foreign Minister told me: We had such high hopes when this \nadministration took office, and we see nothing. We are getting no \nattention for our issues. We must work with your country. And, \nactually, he quit his post because there was no communication.\n  We then see what is happening in North Korea, amazing developments in \nNorth Korea. And we cannot seem to get the administration to focus on \nit at all.\n  Let me tell you, those of us on the west coast, yes, that is why my \nconstituents are coming up to me in the supermarket and pulling at my \nsleeve, because the North Koreans have a missile that can reach \nAmerica. They already have the nuclear weapon. They already have kicked \nout the inspectors. And what is the answer? When the President put them \nin the ``axis of evil,'' I asked, from my seat on the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, the State Department: Before the President put North Korea \nin the ``axis of evil,'' was there a conversation about the \nramifications of that? And the answer came back to me, I say to my \nfriend: Well, we did go in and we did see the President--this is the \nhighest levels of the State Department--and we said we agreed that \nNorth Korea deserved to be on the ``axis of evil.''\n  I said: That was not my question. There are a lot of people who could \nbe termed evil in this world. My question was, did you discuss the \nramifications? The answer was: No, we did not.\n  I asked: Well, did you call up our friends, our allies, with whom we \nshare classified information every day--South Korea, Japan--to talk to \nthem about the ramifications of putting North Korea in the ``axis of \nevil''? Oh, no, came the answer, we do not share State of the Union \nspeeches with other countries.\n  Well, that was not the point about the State of the Union speech. It \nis South Korea that looks across the line at North Korea. I have been \non that line, that DMZ. By the way, what a failure to humankind that \nsituation is--one people divided. It is just the saddest situation, one \nof the saddest failures of humanity.\n  So we had the situation on 9/12/01, where the whole world was with \nus--the whole world. And after that, that whole situation has been \nsquandered.\n  I heard Senator Leahy make similar remarks today about this. I think \nwe have to understand where we are today. And we need to understand \nthere are problems all over this globe, and that for us to go it \nalone--or almost alone--in a war with Iraq will make matters worse, I \nam afraid. As a leader, you have to win over your friends, and others, \nthrough your reasoning, through your evidence, through your power of \npersuasion, not just buying people off or giving them money.\n  There has been a lot of talk about what we are going to give Turkey \nfor their cooperation. Look, I understand an ally is an ally, a friend \nis a friend, and so on; but this thing is still not resolved, and the \ncosts go up. I don't think the American people understand that this is \ntheir tax dollars we are talking about--$5 billion in grants, when we \nare about to kick off the rolls almost 600,000 children from \nafterschool programs, according to the President's budget, and not \nfully funding our disabled kids in school, and the cleanup of only 40 \nSuperfund sites instead of the 87 President Clinton did during his \ntenure.\n  These things just don't come about in a vacuum. I thought Senator \nByrd was so well spoken when he made the point that we don't even know \nthe cost. Remember Larry Lindsey, I say to my friend from Nevada, the \nPresident's economic advisor? He put out--I think last summer--a \nstatement saying it is going to cost us between $100 billion and $200 \nbillion for a war in Iraq.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will yield. Isn't that the man who was fired \nrecently?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Fired, let go.\n  It is going to cost between $100 billion and $200 billion. Now they \nare saying it is $95 billion. They started off saying it was going to \nbe $30 billion, $40 billion, $50 billion, or $60 billion, but that \ndoesn't count what they want to pay to Turkey. When you add in the loan \nguarantees and the rest, some people are saying that is $26 billion. \nAnd we are not reimbursing our States for the work our local police, \nour firemen, and our emergency workers are doing. We are neglecting \nport security.\n  I read today--and this is close to my heart--a little article, which \nI will send to my colleagues. It is very important. It says that many \nterrorist groups now have stinger missiles, shoulder-fired missiles. We \nhave seen five, six, seven examples of terrorist groups over the years \naiming at commercial aircraft. Admiral Loy's Deputy has said this is \nworrisome. It is going to cost money to prepare our commercial fleet, \nto have an antimissile system put on, just as the Israelis reportedly \ndo. The technology is there. Yes, it is going to cost a million dollars \nper plane, but we are busy giving money out around the world. We are \nbusy giving money out. We don't hear the name Osama bin Laden. One of \nmy colleagues, Senator Dorgan, calls him Osama ``been forgotten'' \nbecause you don't hear anything about him.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. As a foundation for my question, I want to say I appreciate \nher statement on the floor. Senator Byrd was here earlier. I told him \nthe same thing I say to the Senator from California. This is a good \ndebate to have. It doesn't matter how you feel about the war. It is \nimportant to have a debate.\n  As I said earlier today on the floor, and I say to the Senator from \nCalifornia, are you aware that the British Parliament had a long, \nextended debate today on the Iraq conflict?\n  Mrs. BOXER. My staff mentioned that they had watched it. I did not \nsee it myself.\n  (Mr. ALEXANDER assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. REID. The senior Senator from Illinois said he watched it for an \nhour before work today. He said it was a great debate. They discussed \nthe issues relating to the conflict that will probably occur in Iraq. I \nsay to my friend from California, it is good that you are speaking to \nalert the American people to some of the problems that may occur with \nthis conflict. It is too bad that the Republicans, the majority, are \nholding up other legislation and other debate because of one fully \nemployed man, Miguel Estrada, who has a job, as we all know, making \nhundreds of thousands of dollars a year. It has been laid out on this \nfloor today that the Bush administration lost 2.8 million jobs. \nMillions are unemployed. But we are hung up on this debate because \nRepublicans won't move off of it.\n\n  My question to the Senator is, would it not be good if we had a full \nday's debate set aside so Senators can offer their views about what is \ngoing on in Iraq?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to my friend, if we are to be relevant--this is the \nword the President talks about when referring to the U.N.--that is what \nwe ought to be doing because, when I went home, people wanted to talk \nabout this because they are nervous about it. Frankly, they don't want \nus to go it alone. At least the vast majority of people in my State \nfeel that way. They are asking me what it is going to cost. I say I \nhave my own guess, but we really have no idea. A man got fired because \nhe said it would cost between $100 billion and $200 billion. Now they \nare saying $95 billion. And now they are offering Turkey $26 billion. \nOne general said they will need to stay there with 200,000 troops for \nyears. Another general said that was wrong. We cannot get an answer to \nthat.\n\n[[Page S2783]]\n\n  We don't know if Saddam Hussein will use these weapons of mass \ndestruction, or what he will do with the oil fields if we go in there. \nMy own view on this is that the American people are very concerned. I \nagree with my friend. We are spending a whole lot of time on the \nnomination of one judicial nominee who, frankly, in my view, cannot \nreally want the job that much because he won't answer the questions. He \nwill not answer the questions. If he answers the questions, we would \nsay immediately, vote cloture, then give him a vote, and that is the \nend of it.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Of course.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator served in Congress, as I did, when the previous \nwar occurred in Iraq, which was more than a decade ago. Does the \nSenator recall--and these numbers may not be exactly accurate, but they \nare close--that the first President Bush reached out and, prior to the \nconflict beginning, there were commitments from various countries to \ngive billions and billions of dollars to help fight the war in Iraq--\nbillions of dollars? And is the Senator also aware that in addition to \ngiving billions of dollars to help with the conflict, other countries \nwere supplying tens of thousands of troops and airplanes?\n  Now, I have pretty reliable sources that say the only country really \nsupplying troops is Great Britain. All of the other countries are \nsaying they support the war, but most of those are in the category of \nTurkey. They are supporting the war if, in fact, they get certain \neconomic benefits. So, in short, is the Senator aware that in the \nprevious conflict there were large sums of money that would be given to \nhelp the U.S. fight that war, and large numbers of troops that were \nbeing sent to the front lines to help the United States troops fight \nthat war? Is the Senator aware that, in fact, basically other than \nGreat Britain, this is our war and nobody is helping?\n  Mrs. BOXER. My friend, the Democratic whip, is absolutely correct. \nOur records show that the first gulf war cost $61 billion. Remember \nthat we stopped well short of Baghdad, when you are thinking what this \nwar will cost. That is a long time ago and there has been inflation. It \nwas $61 billion then, and $54 billion was paid for by our friends \naround the world. That is more than 80 percent, when you figure it all \nout.\n  I further say to my friend that we had many countries sending troops, \nover 20. In this case, the administration is telling us we need 250,000 \ntroops for this war, and Britain is sending in 26,000 troops. That is \nabout right, 26,000 troops and 250,000. That is pretty much in terms of \ncombat troops. That's it.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. The reports I received today is the United States alone has \nin the gulf area 210,000 troops, plus Great Britain--I do not know how \nmany they have there, but, in fact, if they need 240,000 troops, is \nwhat I am told, the United States is doing it all with the help of \nGreat Britain. There are other countries saying they support us. Those \ncountries, I repeat to the Senator, and I think she will agree, want \nsome economic benefit to even say they support us, even though they are \nnot sending any troops.\n  Mrs. BOXER. It is an unprecedented handout type of situation, which \nis offensive to me in many ways. This is a go-it-alone situation where \nit stands today.\n  I will finish where I started this conversation about Iraq. We had \neveryone with us after 9/11--the whole world. We lost that. People \naround the world are looking at us, and many are saying this was \nsomething the President had decided and he just went to the United \nNations because he was kind of pushed there--and as one of the people \nwho pushed him there, I am glad he went there. Believe me, I give \ncredit where credit is due. I give credit to Colin Powell. But going \nthere and winking and nodding and saying, I am going to go to the \nU.N.--but really I know what I want to do--I will give a particular \ncase in point.\n  Whenever there is a little progress in finding some of these weapons, \nthe President says things such as: Oh, that is the tip of the iceberg, \nand he may be right. But wouldn't it be better to say something such \nas: This is the tip of the iceberg, Saddam Hussein, and I am asking you \nto give us the rest of the iceberg, to do it now to avoid war, to avoid \nbloodshed. The world is watching.\n  We do not seem to hear those words. What we really hear is: \nInspections mean nothing. Maybe it means nothing, and if it means \nnothing, then the U.N. eventually is going to call this guy on it. They \nare going to call him on it, just like they did before. By the way, \nthese weapons are a threat to the world, and a lot of the world is a \nlot closer to him than we are, and a lot of the world could potentially \nbe reached by his missiles.\n  The question for me, as one Senator, has never been should Saddam be \ndisarmed--absolutely he should. Back in August when the President was \nsaying we are going to go to war, I said: Wait a minute, the issue is \nweapons of mass destruction; let's see if we can get intrusive \ninspections back in there and pick up where we left off with the \ninspections which destroyed--and I read the list into the Record \nalready--more weapons of mass destruction than we did with our bombs. \nIf this is really about that, then we know the proven way to do it. And \nif Saddam ever so much as kicks the inspectors out, does not cooperate \nwith them, thwarts them, we will know it, and we will be on the moral \nhigh ground. We will have the whole world back in our hands, and we can \nmove forward with the world community, just as my friend pointed out \nhappened in 1990.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I will be glad to yield to the Senator from Nevada for another \nquestion.\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate that.\n  Mr. President, I mentioned earlier and I ask the Senator if she is \naware of a new poll that came out today conducted by a nonpartisan \npublic interest group called the Pew Research Center. The Senator has \nheard of that prominent group, is that right?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I heard of the group. I do not know of the poll.\n  Mr. REID. This poll was conducted between February 12 and February \n18. As the Senator knows, 1,254 participants is a big poll. Will the \nSenator agree with that statement?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Correct.\n  Mr. REID. Is the Senator aware that when these people were asked in \nthis nationwide poll how George W. Bush is handling the economy, only \n43 percent of the people say they like the way he is handling the \neconomy, but 48 percent disapprove of the way he is handling the \neconomy?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to my friend, this does not surprise me. We are \nseeing the worst economic record of any administration in 50 years in \nterms of jobs lost, in terms of mortgages defaulted, in terms of loss \nof stock market value. We are talking $8 trillion of loss, in terms of \nfear about retirement, fear about losing health care, fear about the \ncost of health care, fear about cost of prescription drugs, fear about \nbeing able to afford to send your kids to get an education. My friend \nhas given me a number that makes eminent sense, and I say it is going \nto continue to plummet because every plan this President comes up with \nis giving tax breaks to the wealthiest among us in the hopes they will \ntrickle down to the working people. It never worked before, and it is \nnot going to work.\n  I am very worried, and that is why people also are very anxious in my \nState about the war and about the economy. It is a two-front challenge \nwe face.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will extend her usual courteousness and \nallow me to ask another question.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Absolutely.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator outlined why people likely feel the way they \ndo, but does the Senator also acknowledge the fact that we have in the \nlast 2 years seen a $7 trillion surplus evaporate? Could that be a \nconcern?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I left that out in the list of items that have gone \nwrong. A $7 trillion surplus disappeared, and we have deficits as far \nas the eye can see. The last deficit I remember under George Bush 1 was \nheaded to $300 billion. As I remember, it was up to $290 billion. We \nall pulled together and said this is an outrage. We worked hard under \nBill Clinton for 8 years and got that down to a surplus which was \nhealthy for our economy, and we had the biggest economic boom in years. \nIt\n\n[[Page S2784]]\n\nhas all been squandered. World opinion has been squandered. The surplus \nhas been squandered.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will yield, is the Senator aware that this \nsame poll, when asked how George Bush is handling tax policy, shows \nthat 42 percent of the people approve of the way he is handling tax \npolicy? And is the Senator aware that for the first time in this \nPresidency, 44 percent of the people feel he is handling it very badly; \nis the Senator aware of that?\n  Mrs. BOXER. My friend is telling me something I was not aware of. I \ndid not see the poll, but again, I think it becomes very clear to the \npeople that every policy that comes down, whether it is taxation of \ndividends, tax breaks for the people at the top of the economic ladder, \nthat we are, in essence, seeing a plan to get this economy revived \nwhich is going to do nothing but put money in the pockets of people \nwhose pockets are stuffed with money. We do not need to do that.\n  I was in California with people who were telling me: Senator, we do \nnot need a tax break. We are doing fine. Worry about homeland security. \nWorry about nuclear powerplants getting protected. Worry about the \nchemical plants being protected. Worry about the homeland security \nfirst responders.\n  I say to my friend, if, God forbid, we are attacked anywhere in our \ncountry, people are going to dial 9-1-1, they are not going to dial the \nPresident, they are not going to dial Senator Reid, Senator Boxer, or \nSenator Hatch. They are going to dial 9-1-1. Those very people are \ntelling us they have not received a penny, and it is a very sad \nsituation.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Today I told the senior Senator from Illinois about the \nvisit I had yesterday with people from Nevada. The woman I remember so \nclearly works for the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department. She has \nworked there for 27 years. For the last 20 years, she has been the \nperson in charge of the 9-1-1 center. Is the Senator aware that she, \nlike many people who work in these entities around the country--and, of \ncourse, in a State of 35 million people, I am sure California has a \nnumber of them--she told me that in Las Vegas, this big sprawling urban \ncenter we now have, that when someone calls 9-1-1 from a telephone, \nsuch as we see on the desk in the corner or such as we have in the \ncloakroom or the Senator has in her home, they know where that phone \ncall comes from.\n  They know the address, they know the location, but now when people \nuse computers for doing their telephoning in a way that is hard for me \nto understand, but I am beginning to understand it better, and cell \nphones, they have no idea where their emergency calls come from. People \nhave died around the country as a result of a call coming into the 911 \ncenter, and they do not know where it is coming from.\n  Does the Senator realize that can all be cured with money? The \ntechnology is here to correct that, but we do not have money to give \nthe State and local governments to correct that one thing to make \nhomeland security and security generally more satisfactory. Is the \nSenator aware of that?\n  Mrs. BOXER. My friend is right. As a matter of fact, the Commerce \nCommittee is holding a hearing to address this problem of people \ndialing 911 from a cell phone. We have had people who are in the midst \nof being a victim of a crime dialing 911 and the law enforcement did \nnot know where it was from. It is a crucial matter that has to be \nresolved.\n  What is amazing is this administration has money to give tax breaks \nto people at the top. The people who earn over a million dollars a year \nare going to get back, oh, gosh, an average of about $80,000 a year \njust from the dividend tax break alone, not to mention an income tax \nbreak. They have the money for that, but they do not have the money to \nhelp our homeland defense.\n  They have money to give to Turkey--they are talking turkey with \nTurkey--that is for sure. Reports of an aid package for Turkey started \noff as a few billion, then it was $6, then $10, then $16. Now I hear it \nis $26 billion. I think it was Senator Dorgan or Senator Durbin who \nsaid maybe our States should change their name to Turkey and they will \ndo better than they are doing now.\n  My friend is right. I have to use a sense of humor because you get \nupset about these things and you cannot keep being outraged.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am happy to yield before I close.\n  Mr. REID. What the Senator said in her statement--and she seems to \nagree with me, and I ask if she does--the reason we are not debating on \nthe Senate floor Senator Daschle's plan to improve the economy, the \nreason we are not debating homeland security issues, the reason we are \nnot debating environmental issues, which I know the Senator from \nCalifornia is so passionate about--no one in the Senate believes more \nin doing things to improve the environment than the Senator from \nCalifornia--and there are so many things we could be talking about \ndealing with the environment, and the multitude of other issues the \nSenator has talked about today. Is the Senator aware the reason we are \nnot doing this is that Republicans do not want us to do it, because \nthey have no plan, that this is just an excuse for them to do nothing, \nbeing hung up on this Estrada thing? Is the Senator aware of that?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am absolutely aware of this. I say to my friend, I went \nthrough the litany at the beginning of my talk about how other nominees \nhave answered a multitude of questions, and as a matter of fact some \nhave sent previously confidential opinions that they have written. All \nthe other side has to do is say to Mr. Estrada, answer the questions, \nand then there can be a vote.\n  When my friend raises the environment, I will take a minute to say \nthat we finally got a report that has been languishing in the \nadministration since June. Surprise, surprise, it was leaked to the \nWall Street Journal, and after it was leaked, then the administration \nreleased it. It has some horrific statistics about what is happening to \nyoung people and women of childbearing age in terms of ingestion of \nmercury through mercury-tainted fish, and the fact that mercury is now \nemerging as a leading cause of neurological damage and I predict will \nbecome an issue in this Senate just the way lead was an issue in other \nSenates. We finally got this report. We begged for it and then got it.\n\n  My friend is right: What could be more important than getting this \neconomy going than protecting the health of our children by bringing \nthat report up for debate and open for discussion? Senator Jeffords has \na great plan, the Clean Power Act, that will take that mercury out of \nthe air, that will save these children from getting neurological \ndamage. Let's debate it. Let's debate Senator Daschle's plan, his \neconomic stimulus plan, that gives the stimulus to the working people, \nversus the Bush plan that gives it to the people who do not even have \nto work because they live off their dividends. I would like to see that \ndebate.\n  If Miguel Estrada really wants this job, he will do what Margaret \nMorrow did, he will do what Judge Paez did, he will do what Marsha \nBerzon did, and answer the questions. There were 4 years of questions \nto Judge Paez. He answered them all. We had to break their filibuster, \nI say to my friend, and we did.\n  Senator Smith at the time was proud to launch the filibuster. Senator \nBob Smith said--and I read it into the Record--this is a filibuster \nlaunched because we need to get questions answered, and it is the right \nthing to do.\n  Mr. REID. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. I want the Senator to know that in addition to answering \nquestions--because Judges Paez and Berzon had a judicial record that \ncould be reviewed.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Correct.\n  Mr. REID. He has none. In addition to answering the questions, we \nasked that he submit the memos he wrote when he was at the Solicitor's \nOffice. The Senator will agree with that?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I did. I said it. I said there was precedent, and I read \noff the five cases where previously confidential memos were released. I \nnamed the gentlemen--they happened to be all men--who were willing to \nrelease it in order to get a vote on their confirmation.\n  So there is adequate precedent for that. There is adequate precedent \nfor\n\n[[Page S2785]]\n\nanswering the questions, and if the Senate has any respect for our work \nand for the Constitution of the United States, which we have been sworn \nto uphold, then we will not roll over when any President, this one or \nany future President, sends a nominee down who cannot even tell if \nthere is one Supreme Court case, in all the hundreds of years, that he \ndisagrees with, cannot even name what jurist he would most emulate. It \nis beyond the pale, the questions Mr. Estrada refused to answer, \nbecause clearly he has been told and trained not to answer any \nquestions.\n  I was proud to come to this Chamber, after my diligent staff went \nback through the Record and got the quotes of Bob Smith who helped lead \nthe filibuster, who got the quotes of Senator Sessions who then said we \nshould have, after we broke the filibuster, yet another vote to \nindefinitely delay a vote.\n  It is extraordinary what has happened. In the Record tonight, for all \nwho will read, we have the quotes of Senator Hatch, who called what \nhappened to Paez a filibuster, who called what Senator Sessions tried \nto do unprecedented. We have the quotes of Senator Smith who said: All \nI am doing is asking questions to get answers, and now let the people \ndecide.\n\n  They are going to run some kind of ads in my State saying: Barbara \nBoxer, shame; she does not like Hispanic nominees.\n  Do you want to know something? To say that is like saying I do not \nsupport women's rights and there is going to be a backlash on that. I \nam the person who recommended the first Mexican-American to sit on a \ndistrict court in Los Angeles, the person who stood on her feet day \nafter day trying to get Richard Paez his seat.\n  They can do all they want because I think the American people \nunderstand we are standing on a principle. If I were the only one on my \nfeet, I would stay on my feet because I think it is wrong to stonewall \nthe Senate and members of the Judiciary Committee who in good will have \napproved, by the way, an enormous number of judges--and who were just \nsimply saying: Answer the questions; give us the memos; we do not know \nwho you are; we want to have a record; we want to make an informed \ndecision. This is the right thing to do.\n  I dare say to my constituents--and I did when I was home; I said: You \nmay be hearing about this, but I want you to know that you sent me here \nnot to be part of the wallpaper behind me--that is pretty easy--not to \ngo along to get along, but to stand up and do my job as a Senator, and \nthat is not to vote on a judicial nominee who has refused to hand over \ndocuments, who has refused to answer questions, who has absolutely no \nrecord on which to judge what he is going to do. Once we have that \ninformation, I am happy to have a vote and let the chips fall where \nthey may.\n\n\n                                  Iraq\n\n  On Iraq, I make a rhetorical plea to the administration: You had the \nwhole world in your hand on 9/12; you don't have it in your hand now. \nLet's get back to being a true leader. Lay out a path for peace. That \nis an American value, to lay out a path for peace. Lay out a path for \npeace, not just the path for war.\n  Get this man disarmed, Saddam Hussein, in a way that does not lead to \nthe loss of life and blood of our people and innocent people. And if we \ndo that, we will be back to where we were on 9/12. If we pay attention \nto other problems in the world, we will be back to where we were on 9/\n12.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. We were elected to take an oath of office to uphold the \nConstitution, defend the Constitution from enemies, foreign and \ndomestic. That is the oath each member takes very seriously. It is an \noath that puts on each of our shoulders the responsibility to decide \nwhat that means.\n  Our distinguished Senator from West Virginia, Robert Byrd, presented \nme with a Constitution when I arrived here. I have learned a great deal \nabout this document, about what it says and means. I have learned about \nthe intentions of the Founders of the country. This document is the \ngospel which each member is required to follow. It says the President, \nby and with the advice and consent of the Senate--it does not say that \nthe Senate shall approve or how the Senate shall consider. It says the \nSenate will be an equal partner with the President. The President will \nmake a nomination, and it is for the Senate to decide, 100 Senators to \ndecide, according to their own values and according to their own \nbackground experience and according to whatever they want to bring to \nbear on that matter how they will decide.\n  I have listened to a lot of these debates in the last couple of weeks \non this matter. I am not a lawyer. I am not on the Judiciary Committee. \nI take very seriously my responsibility to weigh someone's career, \nweigh someone's character, to try to assess whether this is the kind of \nperson I want to support to put on a court where he will be presiding, \nif he chooses, for the rest of his life; where he will be making \ndecisions that will affect millions of people, whether someone has the \nright to housing or whether someone has the right to be protected from \ndiscrimination, whether some schoolchildren can go to school under \nbetter conditions. I don't know what kind of decisions this man will \nface, but I know they will be important. I know they will last for a \nlong time and last beyond his own lifetime.\n\n  In effect, we are making a decision about someone who will be \nimpacting the lives of Americans for two or three generations. That is \nthe only time this person will be evaluated by his fellow citizens \nbefore that decision is made, unlike all of us who face our electorate \nevery 6 years, or the House Members every 2 years, and the President \nhimself every 4 years. This man will be appointed to the bench for \nlife. I believe I am within my rights as one of the 100 who will make \nthat decision to have sufficient information that I can make an \ninformed judgment.\n  It is not for me to say to the administration the criteria they \nshould use in making this kind of appointment. But I would be \nsurprised, frankly, that out of all the vast numbers of highly \nqualified people in the country there would be someone chosen for the \nsecond highest court in the country without any previous judicial \nexperience. If that is the case, I believe we have a special need to \nhave information provided, to give each of us the information we seek \nand need to make that determination. That is not forthcoming, either.\n  We are told we can have certain information and we cannot have other \ninformation. I received a note from the White House counselor saying \nMr. Estrada would meet with me, and I appreciate the gesture. I don't \nwant to go back into my office off the record and have a conversation. \nI want to know on the record. This man does not have a judicial record. \nWe have to find other means of obtaining that information. I am \nwondering why it is that somebody with no judicial record, no series of \ndecisions that we can look to, writings we can look to for guidance as \nto his views, why he would not feel, and why the nominator would not \nfeel a special obligation to provide that information.\n  If I went before the voters of Minnesota and refused to answer some \nof the questions Mr. Estrada refused to answer before the Judiciary \nCommittee, I would be laughed out of the election. Certainly no one \nshould vote for me if I would not give voters any information to allow \nthem to understand my philosophy, what I value or not, what decisions I \nagreed with or disagreed with in the past, just basic information which \nwe do not have about this man because he has no judicial record because \nhe has never been a judge.\n  We have elected people in Minnesota who have not had prior \nexperience, and it is fashionable to say they are not a career \npolitician. In fact, we have a Governor who just departed who had that \nview, that was the right kind of qualification.\n  If I got on an airplane and the pilot said this is going to be a \ndifferent kind of flight; I have never flown a commercial airline \nbefore, I would not feel more confident. I would be pretty worried. If \nsomebody says they are taking their child in for surgery, and someone \nsaid that doctor had never performed that kind of surgery before, I \nwould be very concerned. I would want to know some information about \nthat individual. I would want to know that person's qualifications. I \nwould want to\n\n[[Page S2786]]\n\nknow if that person had the training and skills to approach that matter \nbefore I trusted my life or the life of one of my children with that \nperson. And we are entrusting the lives of unknown, not-yet-identified, \nvery real people, very real Americans who will have to go before that \ncourt, where that court will review decisions that are made that are \ntheir last course. If justice is not served, justice will be forever \ndenied them and that will be a tragic injustice they will suffer for \nthe rest of their lives.\n\n  We cannot foresee all of that. We cannot prevent all of it. We have a \nresponsibility to the Constitution of the United States which we swore \nto uphold and defend, which our Founders thought so important that they \ndid not even talk about the country; they talked about the \nConstitution. That was our responsibility. Senator Byrd says that our \nresponsibility is to uphold the Constitution. That is our \nresponsibility. That is the responsibility of each of us.\n  I might want something different in terms of information or \nbackground than other of my colleagues. For some of my colleagues, the \nfact that the President made this nomination, he is of their political \nparty, that is all the information they need, well, that is the \nabsolute right of all of my colleagues who decide that way.\n  I don't question someone else's right to make their decision however \nthey determine based on that, the same way I don't want anyone to \nquestion my right to have the information that I probably need, just \nbasic information so I can know the background, qualifications, \njudicial philosophy, and views of this person. I don't believe any \nelectorate in any State in this country would elect somebody who wanted \nto serve in a high office--Governor, Senate, member of the House--who \nhad no prior political record, no prior involvement in public life, and \nwent before the electorate and said: I want to be elected and I am not \ngoing to tell you where I stand or what I believe or what I do or what \nI agreed with in the past or who I like or do not like. I don't think \nanywhere in America there would be positive reaction to that.\n  I don't believe there would be a board of directors in corporate \nAmerica that would hire somebody for an important position--chief \nexecutive officer, chief operating officer, the No. 2 position--that \nwould even consider someone who would not provide the basic information \nthat we are asking for here.\n  To me this gets into the realm of just being ludicrous, that we are \nin a position of being questioned for taking the particular position \nthat says we want information.\n  I agree with my colleague from California. If we get the information, \nthen there will be a vote. If we get information so those of us who \nhave these reservations--and really, in my case, I have not come to a \nfinal decision because I do not have the information with which to do \nso. But I am not going to make that decision, I am not going to agree \nto this matter coming before this body, if I can help it, until I have \nthat information. That is just the way it is. That is the position I \nhave taken. Again, that is my right to do so and that is the right of \nany one of my colleagues in this situation.\n  We are spending an awful lot of time here, way too much time, on this \nmatter, given what is going on in the country today. We ought to be \nsetting this nomination aside, giving the nominee the opportunity to \npresent in writing the information we have requested. Either do so or \nnot. We can assess it accordingly. We ought to turn the attention of \nthis body to matters that, when I was in Minnesota last week, certainly \nconcerned every one of the citizens I talked and listened to. It was \nnot the nomination of Miguel Estrada, important as that is. It is about \nthe war in Iraq that is looming. It is people's fears of whether we \nwere going in; what is the right thing to do. The fact that the week \nbefore they were told to go out and buy plastic and duct tape, go out \nand buy bottled water and food. They are not very reassured in \nMinnesota about the ability of their Government to protect them. They \nare not really sure.\n  I must say, based on information I have received, what I have heard \nexpressed from local law enforcement officials in Minnesota, that what \nwe passed in Congress has not gotten out to these first responders--\nresources, training, information.\n  I had the sheriff of the largest county in Minnesota, Hennepin \nCounty, in my office today. He cannot get information about what \nhappened with the raising of the national security alert. He said he \nfound out about it on CNN. He is a sheriff. He is part of the network \nof emergency responders for the city of Minneapolis, the largest city, \nlargest county. He does not have any source of information from the \nFederal Government to tell him even that such a code has been \nestablished, much less what the reasons are, much less what some of the \ncircumstances might be.\n  He said he tried to find out from the FBI, with which he has a very \ngood working relationship, what the circumstances were. They didn't \nknow either. They hadn't gotten any prior word. That certainly \nastonished me.\n  On the Governmental Affairs Committee and I sat through the hearings \nwhere this was being discussed. It was my clear understanding that the \nnew Department of Homeland Security was going to be in constant \ncommunication with the FBI and CIA, that information was going to be \nshared, and they would all have that information. I also understood, \nbecause we certainly provided the funding and we certainly made it \nclear in the hearings on the floor that we intended for that Department \nto be communicating, providing resources, providing training, providing \nexpertise and getting that out to the Hennepin counties of Minnesota--\nand America.\n\n  Lo and behold, he doesn't know. The FBI district office in \nMinneapolis, MN, doesn't know. So he is watching CNN. He was not very \nconfident about how well this administration has done its job to get \nthis country prepared for what may lie ahead.\n  The citizens of Minnesota, as I said, are certainly alarmed. I \nbelieve they have an absolute right to expect that this body, this \ninstitution of the Senate would be turning its attention to these \nmatters of concern.\n  So I say again, respectfully, to the majority leader, the time has \ncome to set this nomination aside to give Mr. Estrada the opportunity \nto respond in writing to the questions which I and others have said \nclearly, again and again, we must have answered to make an informed \njudgment, which is my constitutional obligation to the country and to \nthe Minnesota people who elected me. I don't think that is much to ask \nat all. Anyway, it is what I am going to ask and require before I am \ngoing to proceed.\n  Then I ask the majority leader, as I wrote 2 weeks ago in a letter, \nthat I and the rest of us turn our attention on this Senate floor to \nthese matters of war and peace, whether the United States of America is \ngoing to commit itself to an invasion of another country, a preemptive \nstrike, something that is going to have profound consequences for our \ncountry--for our world for years to come.\n  Our silence here, as again the distinguished senior Senator from West \nVirginia, Mr. Byrd, said the other day, is just profoundly deafening, \nthe silence here in the Senate, the absence of debate, the absence of \n100 different views on what we are doing, what we propose to do, what \nmight we do.\n  Of course the real tragedy, in my view, and the real embarrassment to \nthis institution, great as it is, and to the House of Representatives, \nis that this document, the Constitution of the United States, states \nvery clearly and definitively that Congress and only Congress shall \ndeclare war. Not the President. No one else. Just Congress.\n  This was very clearly the intention of those who drafted the \nConstitution, whose wisdom and foresight is something I find \nunbelievable, that a group of people back over 200 years ago could \nhave, on their first attempt--not that they didn't have drafts, but \nthat they could put together a document that would be as brilliantly \nforesighted as this turned out to be, and anticipatory of just these \nkinds of matters: Where the temptation is to let it go somewhere else; \nwhere the pressures are from some person or groups of people to forget \nsomething or overlook something or circumvent something. They made the \nPresident of the United States the Commander in Chief of all the Armed \nForces--back then of the militia. For that very reason they didn't want \nhim, they didn't want any\n\n[[Page S2787]]\n\none person--it is not just this President; it is any President--they \ndidn't want that one person making the decision to commit this Nation \nto war or keep us in peace. Boy, were they ever right. Did they ever \nunderstand why that should be a decision made by an elected group such \nas the Congress.\n  We didn't declare war back in October. The President was not at that \npoint himself--and I gather not even today is it appropriate--ready to \nmake that final, fateful decision. That was 4 months ago, before we \neven got to this point. We didn't declare war. What we said is we will \ngive the President the authority to do whatever he determines needs to \nbe done, including the use of force. That is one of those euphemisms \nwe use to hide our true intent, which means if he wants to have a war, \nhe starts one. We will preapprove it and he can proceed. That is not \nanywhere near what the Constitution says, nor what was intended it say, \nnor how it was intended to be followed.\n\n  Before this Nation is committed to a war, before American men and \nwomen are sent across our border to fight and some of them to die, \nbefore possibly people in this country might suffer those grotesque \nexperiences, they have the right that their elected officials will give \nthis matter their most serious consideration for a length of time that \nis appropriate. It will not take as long as has the squabble over Mr. \nEstrada, but it ought to take a while, because this decision is \nprofound.\n  The fact that we are here on the Senate floor now, the third day we \nare back from our recess--the fact we had a recess at all last week \nrather than being here debating these issues of war and peace--the fact \nthat we are doing something now that, as I said earlier, has its own \nsignificance, has its own place, but pales in comparison with war and \npeace and the enormity of those decisions about the preparation of the \ncountry and the Department of Homeland Security, the preparedness of \nthis Government to protect all of its citizens--those are the matters \nthat concern the people of Minnesota almost to the exclusion of \nanything else; even to the exclusion of the problems with the economy \nwith all those difficulties. Those are the matters which we should be \nreviewing on the Senate floor.\n  If the President believes we should commit our forces to invade \nanother country, to launch a preemptive attack, to start a war against \nanother country--which is almost unprecedented in our Nation's history, \nand is certainly unprecedented in the context of leaping forward to cut \noff a threat which is not imminent, not immediate, but rather one which \nwe believe would materialize, and probably would if certain lines were \ncrossed, to remove the Government, the leader of another country--these \nare decisions which are so enormous in their scope immediately and \nwhich are going to have such consequence for this world for decades to \nfollow that it is wrong for us to turn the other way, for us to refuse \nto fulfill our constitutional responsibility. What we should do is \nbring these matters to the Senate floor and say, Mr. President, that \nwas the 107th Congress, this is the 108th Congress, we are a different \nbody, we want to recertify that constitutional responsibility that \nCongress and only Congress shall declare war.\n  No President is authorized by the Constitution to commit any forces \nin such a way until that decision has been made and voted on by the \nCongress. That is what we ought to be doing here. The American people \nhave a right. They elected us, and they sent us here, and they expect \nno less of us and will hold us in the highest reproach if we fail to \nfulfill that responsibility, if we fail to even bring the matter up, or \nif we fail to direct our attention and declare ourselves one after \nanother on the record for or against. We owe that to the people who \nfounded this country, who sustained this document--many at the cost of \ntheir own lives. We owe that to the courageous Americans--men and \nwomen--who are amassed on the borders halfway around the world who will \nhave to carry out that decision, if it is made, to proceed to fight. \nSome will be wounded and maimed. Some will lose their lives because of \nthat decision.\n  We owe them nothing less than to fulfill our responsibility here in \nthe Senate at this time or as soon as the President determines that \nmatter should be brought to our attention.\n  Two weeks ago, think of what we went through. Our citizens were told \nto go out and buy duct tape and plastic sheets and not even told really \nwhat to do with them. In Minnesota, we are well aware of that. We are a \ncold-weather State. We have quite a bit of experience putting up \nplastic sheeting and filling up drafts around doors and windows. It is \nnot something you can do lightly. You can increase the concentration of \nradon in the rooms by closing them up too tightly. The information \nwasn't even in necessarily the best interests and the best health of \npeople who would be doing it. They are entitled to a lot more from \ntheir Government than that. They are entitled to know a lot more than \nto go out and get bottled water or canned food and duct tape and \nplastic sheets, and, good luck and God help us. They deserve a lot more \nthan that. That is why on the floor of the Senate we should be bringing \nup homeland security and discussing what more needs to be done and the \nresources that are needed.\n  I want to bring forth the voice of the sheriff of Hennepin County, \nMN, and his concerns. I want to know why he wasn't told the country was \ngoing through the second highest security level and why he had to find \nout about it from television rather than from the Department of \nHomeland Security which was established by this body to provide that \nkind of information--supposedly provide that kind of coordination, \nservices, and resources. God forbid that something would happen to \nHennepin County and they wouldn't have the benefit of that information; \nthey would not know what to expect, what it might be, where it would be \ncoming from.\n  These are critical life-and-death responsibilities that I know the \nFederal Government and Secretary Ridge take very seriously. I have \nnothing but the highest respect and regard for him and the monumental \ntask he is undertaking. I hold nothing but the highest respect for the \nsheriff of Hennepin County. The two of them ought to be working and \ncoordinating. The sheriff ought to have the resources we provided last \nAugust in this body. It was vetoed by the President. There is more \nforthcoming from the 2003 appropriations. We want to make sure that \nthose resources are getting out to local government first responders \nall over the United States of America so that they have that ability to \ntrain, to prepare, and to be equipped to respond as much as possible.\n  Again, we hope and pray it will never happen. But if it should \nhappen, they will have to be brought into action. Every second is going \nto count. Every person is going to have to make the right decision. \nLife depends on how well we help them be prepared.\n\n  I commend the majority leader's request that this nomination of Mr. \nEstrada be set aside and that he be given the time and the opportunity \nto respond in writing to the questions of those of us who do not have \nthe information that we believe we need to make the decision--that he \nprovide that information to us; that we take a period of time then to \nfocus on what is a life-and-death and most urgent concern of every \ncitizen in Minnesota whom I met with and heard from last week. Even if \nthere was another topic of conversation, they wanted to know about \nIraq. They wanted to express their own views and own concerns. They see \nus on C-SPAN doing nothing but talking about the nomination, and the \nsame the next night and the next night.\n  I shudder to think what they must think about our sensibilities and \nour priorities. It is wrong. We owe it to those citizens to do our best \nin everything we stand for to bring this body back to focusing on the \nmost critical time of our Nation--the pending war, the decision there, \nthe responsibility of the Congress to declare war. And only Congress \ncan declare war. Those of us who voted for resolution last fall \nabdicated to the President. It doesn't absolve our responsibility and \nwhat we must do now to stand up and take that responsibility back and \nmake that decision and be held accountable by the people of America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Talent). The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I am a new Senator. I am aware of the\n\n[[Page S2788]]\n\ntraditions of the Senate, one of which is that a new Senator is not \nexpected to say much--at least throughout the year is not expected to \nsay much--to begin with until they have something of importance to say. \nSo I have not said much.\n  I had been planning to make my first remarks on this floor next \nTuesday on the issues I care most about, which are the education of our \nchildren and putting the teaching of American history and civics back \nin its rightful place in our schools so that our children can grow up \nknowing what it means to be an American. I planned on doing that next \nTuesday. But I have decided to make some remarks today--earlier than \nexpected because I am disappointed in what I have heard in the debate \nabout Miguel Estrada.\n  Like my friend from Missouri, I have had the opportunity to preside \nin the last few days. That is one of the honors that are accorded new \nMembers of the Senate. I have been listening very carefully. My \ndisappointment has increased with each of these 10 days as the debate \nhas continued.\n  I am disappointed first because I believe our friends on the other \nside of the aisle are being unfair to Miguel Estrada. I am most \ndisappointed in them because I believe if the direction of this debate \ncontinues as it is going--and I heard the comments of my friend from \nMissouri yesterday on this same matter--if we continue in the same \ndirection, we run the risk of permanently damaging the process by which \nwe select Federal judges and by which we dispense justice in the United \nStates. I am disappointed because this is not what I expected when I \ncame to the Senate.\n  I may be new to the Senate, but I know something about judges. I am a \nlawyer. I once clerked for a U.S. Attorney General. His name was Robert \nKennedy. I once clerked for a great Federal appellate judge. His name \nwas John Minor Wisdom of New Orleans. I once worked in this body 36 \nyears ago for Senator Howard Baker, a great lawyer. I watched this body \nas it considered and confirmed men and women to the Federal courts of \nthis land. As Governor of Tennessee for 8 years, I had the \nresponsibility of appointing--and did appoint--nearly 50 men and women \nto judgeships all the way from chancellorships to the supreme court.\n  I know pretty well the process we have followed in the Senate and in \nthis country for the last couple of centuries.\n  It is fairly simple. It can be expressed in plain English. The \nExecutive nominates, the Senate considers, and then confirms or rejects \nthe nomination; and in doing so, what the Senators have always looked \nfor, mainly, has been good character, good intelligence, good \ntemperament, a good understanding of the law and the duties of a judge, \nand whether a nominee seems to have courtesy for those who may come \nbefore him or her. And it has always been assumed that it is \nunnecessary--and, in fact, it is unethical by the standards of most of \nthe judicial canons in this country--for the nominee to try to say how \nhe or she would decide a case that might come before him or her.\n  Then, after all that examination is done in the Senate, there is a \nvote. And under our constitutional traditions, the majority decides.\n  I have been listening very carefully, and that is not what is \nhappening. The other side has simply decided that it will not allow the \nSenate to vote on the nomination of Miguel Estrada. In doing so, it is \ndoing something that has never been done for a circuit court of appeals \njudge in our Nation's history.\n  In those hours that I have presided over this body in the last few \ndays, I have been listening very carefully to see what reasons our \nfriends on the other side could give for coming to such an \nextraordinary conclusion about whom I have come to learn is an \nextraordinary individual, Miguel Estrada.\n  I have been listening carefully for the answers, especially to these \nthree questions: No. 1, what is wrong with Miguel Estrada? What is \nwrong with him? No. 2, why can't we vote on Miguel Estrada, after 10 \ndays of debate? And, No. 3--most importantly--why should we change the \nconstitutional tradition that a majority of the Senate will decide \nwhether to confirm Miguel Estrada? Because what they are saying, \nreally, is that he will need to get 60 votes--60 votes--instead of 51.\n  I have had the privilege of listening to each of their arguments. As \nmy friend from Missouri knows, they first try one argument, and it does \nnot go so well. Then they move to another argument, and it does not \nstand the light of day. And then they move to another one.\n  But let me tell you what I have heard as I have listened to the \ndebate.\n  First, they said--it would be hard to imagine that anyone could say \nthis with a straight face, but we had many straight faces on the other \nside of the aisle saying this--that he was not qualified to be a \nFederal appellate judge.\n  You do not hear that argument very much anymore because that is \nalmost a laughable comment if it were not such a serious matter.\n  But let's go over this. This man isn't just qualified; if this were \nsports, he would be on the Olympic team, and he would be getting an \naward for ``American Dream Story of the Year.''\n  Here is a man who came to this country at age 17 from Honduras. He \nhad a speech impediment. He spoke very little English. And within a \nshort period of time, he was attending Columbia University, one of the \nmost prestigious universities in America.\n  Then he went to Harvard Law School. Now, it is really hard to get \ninto Harvard Law School. It has great competition. Everyone who is \napplying to a law school around the United States of America this \nyear--and I know a great many of them--think about it. This young man, \nin a few years, was admitted to Harvard Law School. And not only that, \nhe became an editor of the Harvard Law Review and graduated magna cum \nlaude.\n\n  This a dream resume, but it is not even over.\n  Then he went to the Second Circuit as a law clerk. Then he became a \nclerk for a Supreme Court Justice. By now he was in the top 1 percent \nof 1 percent of all law school students in the country, with the kind \nof resume for a lawyer every law firm in the country would want to \nhire. He has a record that almost everyone would admire.\n  Then he went to the Southern District of New York, one of the most \ncompetitive places, to be hired for training there.\n  Then he was in the Solicitor General's Office. To those who are not \nlawyers or who do not keep up with this sort of thing, just being in \nthe Solicitor General's Office might not sound like such a big deal, \nbut those are the plum positions. The way I understand that office, \nthere are a couple of political appointees there--the Solicitor General \nand his Deputy--and there are about 20 career lawyers. Miguel Estrada \nwas one of those lawyers. They are there because they are not just \ngood, they are the best in America. They have the best resumes. They \nhave been the clerks to the Supreme Court Justices. They are going to \nbe the greatest lawyers. It is the most competitive position in which \nyou can be.\n  And there he is, Miguel Estrada, coming here at age 17, barely \nspeaking English, making his way into there. He worked there for the \nClinton administration and the Bush administration.\n  Then he went to one of the major law firms of America. And he has \nargued 15 cases before the Supreme Court of the United States.\n  That is an incredibly talented record. There is almost no one who has \nbeen nominated for any judgeship in our country's history who has a \nsuperior record. For anyone to have even suggested for 15 minutes that \nMiguel Estrada is not superbly qualified to be a member of the United \nStates Court of Appeals--for anyone to even suggest that--it is \ndifficult to see how one could do that with a straight face.\n  Little has been made about what he did in the Solicitor General's \nOffice. I think it is worth talking about that. These talented young \nmen and women have the job of helping the Solicitor General make \ndecisions about what to do in cases in which the United States is a \nparty. That means they review all the decisions that come against us, \nthe United States of America. They are the lawyers for us, the United \nStates of America.\n  They write memoranda and they write opinion and they must argue back \nand forth. And they must argue about every side of every issue. And\n\n[[Page S2789]]\n\nour friends on the other side have come up with straight-face argument \nNo. 2, which is that somehow Mr. Estrada, who does not even have all \nthose memoranda, should be penalized because the U.S. Government does \nnot want to hand those memoranda, that were exchanged back and forth \nbetween the various Solicitor General's assistants, over to the Senate.\n  We have never done that. There are seven living former Solicitors \nGeneral of the United States, and seven--all of them--have written a \nletter to this body saying that has never been done, and it never \nshould be done, for obvious reasons. If it were done, you would never \nhave any straightforward memoranda left in that office. It protects us, \nthe United States. And that never should even be considered to be held \nagainst Mr. Estrada.\n\n  So is he qualified? It is hard to imagine someone who is better \nqualified. I consider it a great privilege to come to the Senate and \nfind a President who discovered such an extraordinary person to \nnominate for the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. \nSuch a story should give inspiration to men and women all over America, \nthat this is the country to which you can come, regardless of race or \nbackground or whatever your condition, and dream of being admitted to \nthe best universities, finding the best jobs in a short period of time, \nand being nominated by the President of the United States for such a \ncourt.\n  What a wonderful story. And what an embarrassing event it is to have \nour friends on the other side to even take the time of this Senate \ntrying to suggest such a person is not qualified. So let's just throw \nthat argument away and put it in the drawer.\n  Since that argument did not fly, they then moved to argument No. 2, \nwhich is equally difficult to offer with a straight face, if I may \nrespectfully say so. They said he has no judicial experience.\n  Now, this argument is still being made. I heard the distinguished \nSenator from New York, last night, in an impassioned address, right \nover on the other side, say he has never been a judge, and we don't \nknow what his opinions are. Never been a judge--Miguel Estrada cannot \nbe a judge because he has never been a judge.\n  Well, I am awfully glad that was not the standard that was applied to \nJustice Felix Frankfurter when President Roosevelt nominated him. He \nwould never have been a judge before he was a Justice of the Supreme \nCourt.\n  I am glad it was not the standard that was applied to Louis Brandeis \nbefore he was nominated to the Supreme Court. I am glad it was not the \nstandard that was applied to Thurgood Marshall, the first African \nAmerican who was ever appointed to the Supreme Court of the United \nStates. He had never been a judge. And so should Thurgood Marshall have \nnever been a Justice because he had never been a judge?\n  When I graduated from New York University Law School, the dean came \nto see me and said I had a chance to be a messenger down in New Orleans \nfor a man that my dean, Bob McKay, said was one of the three or four \nbest Federal judges in the country. His name was John Minor Wisdom, a \ngreat man and a great lawyer. He had never been a judge before \nPresident Eisenhower appointed him. Neither had Albert Tuttle from \nAtlanta or John Brown from Texas. The three of them became three of the \ngreatest judges in the South. They presided, having been appointed by a \nRepublican President, over the desegregation of the southern U.S. They \nwere among the greatest judges we have ever had, and they had never \nbeen judges.\n\n  Of 108 Supreme Court Justices who have been appointed, 43 of those \nhave never been a judge. I have a list somewhere here of judge after \njudge after judge. Earl Warren; Byron White; Justice Powell; Justice \nRehnquist; Justice Breyer; Judge Wisdom's favorite friend on the second \ncircuit, Henry Friendly of New York. He had never been a judge before. \nCharles Clark; Jerome Frank; John Paul Stevens; Warren Burger; Harold \nLeventhal; Spottswood Robinson; Ruth Bader Ginsberg, who had never been \na judge before she was a Justice. Does that mean she wasn't qualified \nto sit on this Court?\n  Why would the other side be taking up the time of the Senate at a \ntime when we are concerned with war with Iraq and the economy is \nhurting, by making that kind of argument? They would be asked to sit \ndown in any respectable law school in America if they gave that answer. \nYet they are here in the Senate trying to persuade us that it makes a \npoint.\n  In 1980, I appointed George Brown of Memphis as the first African \nAmerican justice in the history of the State of Tennessee. If George \nBrown had to be a judge before he had become a justice, I could never \nhave appointed an African American justice, because there were no \nAfrican American judges at that time. Even today, given the paucity of \nHispanics and African Americans and women who are judges, if we were to \nsay that in order for someone to be a judge, before he or she becomes a \njudge, we would have a terrible, invidious discrimination against men \nand women who should not be discriminated against, and I am sure my \nfriends on the other side don't want to see that happen.\n  So even though we have spent days arguing that Miguel Estrada should \nnot be considered because he has never been a judge, that argument has \nno merit to it whatsoever. We hear it less and less now that it is on \nthe tenth day.\n  Well, those two arguments didn't fly because here is a superbly \nqualified person. So they said he didn't answer the questions.\n  I just had the privilege of hearing the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia and the distinguished Senator from Minnesota spend a long \ntime talking about that, saying he hasn't answered questions. Well, Mr. \nPresident, I am not a member of the Judiciary Committee, but I know \nthey had hearings and I know Members on the other side were in charge \nof the Senate when they had the hearings. I know the hearings could \nhave gone on as long as they wanted them to because they were in \ncharge. If I am not mistaken, the distinguished Senator from Utah was \nhere. I believe they went on all day long. The hearings were unusually \nlong. Miguel Estrada was there and he answered their questions. Every \nSenator on the committee had the opportunity to ask followup questions \nin writing, and two did. The Senator from Massachusetts and the Senator \nfrom Illinois did that. Mr. Estrada gave those answers in writing. He \nhas now said to Members of the Senate that he is available for further \nquestions. He will be glad to visit with them.\n  What does he have to do to answer the questions? Why is there a new \nstandard for Miguel Estrada? Why do we say to him, for the first time, \ntell us your views in a particular case before we will confirm you? We \nhave tradition rooted in history that it is even unethical to do that. \nI appointed 50 judges, as I said, when I was Governor. When I sat down \nwith these judges, I didn't ask: How would you rule on TVA and the rate \ncase, or how would you rule on partial-birth abortion, in the abortion \ncase; or what would you do about applying the first amendment to the \nissue of whether to take the Ten Commandments down from the courthouse \nin Murfreesboro, TN, or how do you feel about prayer in the schools, or \nif somebody says a prayer before a football game?\n\n  I didn't do that because I didn't think it was right to ask a judge \nto decide a case before the case came before him, which has been the \ntradition in this country. We are not appointing legislators to the \nbench, or precinct chairmen, or think-tank chairmen, or Senators; we \nare appointing judges. They are supposed to look at the facts and \nconsider the law and come to a conclusion. But they say he didn't \nanswer the questions.\n  Mr. President, the only way I know to deal with that--because this \nside says one thing and that side says the other, and since I am not on \nthe Judiciary Committee--is to read the questions and the answers. I \nwanted to see whether he was asked some questions and whether he gave \nsome answers.\n  These are the questions and answers, Mr. President. This is the \nrecord of the hearing of Miguel Estrada, plus a long memorandum of \nquestions from the Senator from Massachusetts and the Senator from \nIllinois that he also answered. I will not take the Senate's time to \nread all of the questions and answers, but since they keep saying he \ndidn't answer the questions, let me give some examples.\n\n[[Page S2790]]\n\n  The chairman of the committee says:\n\n       Mr. Estrada, we have heard you have held many strongly-held \n     beliefs. You are a zealous advocate. That is great. You know, \n     lawyers who win cases are not the ones who say ``on the one \n     hand, this, on the other hand, that.'' They are zealous. But \n     you also have to make sure, if you are going to enforce the \n     laws, that your personal views don't take over the law. \n     Senator Thurmond has asked every single nominee I have ever \n     heard him speak to--Republican or Democrat--to speak to that \n     effect. What would you say is the most important attribute of \n     a judge, and do you possess that?\n\n  A very good question.\n  Answer:\n\n       The most important quality for a judge, in my view, Senator \n     Leahy, is to have an appropriate process for decisionmaking. \n     That entails having an open mind, it entails listening to the \n     parties, reading their briefs, going back behind the briefs \n     and doing the legal work needed to ascertain who is right in \n     his or her claims. In courts of appeals court where judges \n     sit in panels of three, it is important to engage in \n     deliberations and give ears to the views of colleagues who \n     may have come to different conclusions. In sum, to be \n     committed to judging as a process that is intended to give us \n     the right answer and not a result. I can give you my level \n     best solemn assurance that I firmly think I have those \n     qualities, or else I would not have accepted the nomination.\n\n  ``Does that include the temperament of the judge?'', asked the \nchairman.\n  Mr. Estrada said:\n\n       Yes, that includes the temperament of a judge. To borrow \n     somewhat from the American Bar Association, the temperament \n     of a judge includes whether he or she is impartial and \n     openminded, unbiased, courteous, yet firm, and whether he \n     will give ear to people who have come into his courtroom and \n     who don't come in with a claim about which the judge may at \n     first be skeptical.\n\n  The chairman said:\n\n       Thank you.\n\n  I submit that is a good answer. I appointed 50 judges and I would \nhave listened to that question. I would give him an A-plus on that.\n  Here is the Senator from Iowa:\n\n       Before I make some comment, I want to ask three basic \n     questions.\n\n  This is in the hearing with Mr. Estrada. This is the man who the \nother side says doesn't answer questions.\n  The Senator from Iowa:\n\n       In general, Supreme Court precedents are binding on all \n     lower Federal courts, and circuit court precedents are \n     binding on district courts within a particular circuit. Are \n     you committed to following the precedents of the higher \n     courts faithfully, giving them full force and effect even if \n     you disagree with such precedents?\n\n  Mr. Estrada:\n\n       Absolutely, Senator.\n\n  How could you make a better answer than that? You could either say \nyes or no. He said yes.\n  The Senator from Iowa:\n\n       What would you do if you believed the Supreme Court or \n     court of appeals had seriously erred in rendering a decision? \n     Would you, nevertheless, apply that decision, or would you \n     use your own judgment on the merits, or the best judgment of \n     the merits?\n\n  Mr. Estrada:\n\n       My duty as a judge, and inclination as a person and as a \n     lawyer of integrity would be to follow the orders of the \n     highest court.\n\n  The Senator from Ohio:\n\n       And if there were no controlling precedent dispositively \n     concluding an issue with which you were presented in your \n     circuit, to which sources would you turn for persuasive \n     authority?\n\n  Mr. Estrada:\n\n       When facing a problem for which there is not a decisive \n     answer from a higher court, my cardinal rule would be to \n     seize aid from any place I could get it. Depending on the \n     nature of the problem, that would include related case law \n     and other areas higher courts had dealt with that had some \n     insights to teach with respect to the problem at hand. It \n     could include history of the enactment, in the case of a \n     statute, legislative history. It could include the custom and \n     practice under any predecessor statute or document. It could \n     include the view of academics to the extent they purport to \n     analyze what the law is instead of prescribing what it ought \n     to be, and, in sum, as Chief Justice Marshall once said, to \n     attempt not to overlook anything from which aid might be \n     derived.\n\n  I give him an A plus for that. That was a good question, and he gave \na superb answer, just the kind of answer I think an American citizen \nwho wants to appear before an impartial court in this country would \nhope to hear. I do not think we want to hear: Welcome to the court, \nMr./Ms. Litigant. We have here your Democratic court; we have here your \nRepublican court. If your views are all right, you might get the right \nhearing. You would want a judge who said what Mr. Estrada said.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts, who has been extremely critical of \nMr. Estrada, asked a more detailed question. Mr. President, you may be \nwondering why I am going into such detail when this is available to the \nwhole world, including the Senators on the other side. The problem is \nperhaps someone has not bothered to offer this book to our friends on \nthe other side because they keep coming down here while you and I are \npresiding day in and day out for 10 straight days and saying Mr. \nEstrada has not answered the questions. My suggestion is he has \nanswered question after question, and he has done a beautiful job of \nanswering the questions.\n  Let me take a few more minutes and give examples of answering \nquestions.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts:\n\n       Now, Mr. Estrada, you made the case before the court that \n     the NAACP should not be granted standing to represent the \n     members. As I look through the case, I have difficulty in \n     understanding why you would believe the NAACP would not have \n     standing in this kind of case when it has been so \n     extraordinary in terms of fighting for those--this is the \n     NAACP--and in this case was making the case of intervention \n     because of their concern about the youth in terms of \n     employment, battling drugs, and also voting.\n\n  In other words, Mr. Kennedy was saying: Mr. Estrada, how can you do \nthis when the NAACP is on the other side?\n  Mr. Estrada's answer:\n\n       The laws that were at issue in that case, Senator Kennedy, \n     and in an earlier case, which is how I got involved in the \n     issue, deal with the subject of street gangs that engage in \n     or may engage in some criminal activity. I got involved in \n     the issue as a result of being asked by the city of Chicago--\n     --\n\n  The last time I checked, the mayor of the city of Chicago was a \nDemocrat, a good mayor, but just so I would not want anyone to think \nthis was a partisan comment----\n\n     which had passed by similar ordinance dealing with street \n     gangs. And I was called by somebody who worked for Mayor \n     Daley when they needed help in the Supreme Court in a case \n     that was pending on the loitering issue. I mention that \n     because after doing my work in that case, I got called by \n     the attorney for the city of Annapolis, which is the case \n     to which you are making reference. They had a somewhat \n     similar law to the one that had been at issue in the \n     Supreme Court. Not the same law. They were already in \n     litigation, as you mentioned, with the NAACP. By the time \n     he called me--\n\n  This is the lawyer for the city--\n\n     he had filed a motion for summary judgment making the \n     argument that you outlined. And he had been met with the \n     entrance into the case by a prominent DC law firm on the \n     other side. He went to the State and local legal center and \n     asked: Who can I turn to to help? And they sent him to me \n     because of the work I had done in the Chicago case. Following \n     that, I did the brief, and the point on the standing issue \n     that you mentioned is that in both Chicago and in the \n     Annapolis ordinance, you were dealing with types of laws that \n     had been passed with significant substantial support from the \n     minority communities. I have always thought that it was part \n     of my duty as a lawyer to make sure that when people go to \n     their elected representatives and ask for those type of laws \n     to be passed to make the appropriate arguments that a court \n     might accept to uphold the judgment of the democratic people. \n     In the context of the NAACP, that was relevant to a legal \n     issue because one of the requirements we argued for \n     representational standing--\n\n  Those who might be listening may think this is awfully detailed, \nawfully specific, awfully long. Mr. President, that is my point. \nSenator Kennedy asked an appropriate and very detailed question about \nan issue involving street gangs in Chicago where Mayor Daley asked Mr. \nEstrada to help, and Mr. Estrada gave Senator Kennedy a very detailed, \ncourteous, respectful, specific answer that has taken me 3 or 4 minutes \nto read, and I am not through yet.\n  The point is, the other side keeps saying he has not answered \nquestions when he has answered the questions. Not only has he answered \nthem, he has answered them in a way a superbly qualified lawyer with \nhis background might be expected to answer.\n  The Senator from Alabama:\n\n       Mr. Estrada, if you are confirmed in this position, and I \n     hope you will be, how do you see the rule of law, and will \n     you tell us, regardless of whether you agree with it or not, \n     you will follow binding precedent?\n\n  Mr. Estrada:\n\n       I will follow binding case law in every case. I don't even \n     know that I can say whether I concur in the case or not \n     without actually having gone through all the work of doing it \n     from scratch. I may have a personal, moral,\n\n[[Page S2791]]\n\n     philosophical view on the subject matter, but I undertake to \n     you that I would put all that aside and decide cases in \n     accordance with the binding case law and even in accordance \n     with the case law that is not binding but seems instructive \n     in the area, without any influence whatsoever from any \n     personal view that I may have about the subject matter.\n\n  What Mr. Estrada was saying to the Senator from Alabama was: Mr. \nSenator, with respect, I may not decide this case the way you would \nlike for it to be decided because I will look at the case law and I \nwill follow the case law, and I might even decide this case the way my \npersonal view would decide it if the case law is different than my \npersonal view. In other words, I think Mr. Estrada is giving the answer \nthat most Americans want of their judges, regardless of what party they \nare in.\n\n  I will give a couple more examples, and I do this because this has \ngone on now 10 days. All I hear from the other side is he will not \nanswer the questions, he is not answering the questions, when, in fact, \nthere is a book full of questions and answers to which I believe law \nprofessors in the law school I attended would give a very high grade.\n  Here is the Senator from Wisconsin:\n\n       With that in mind, Mr. Estrada, I would like to know your \n     thoughts on some of the following issues. Mr. Estrada, what \n     do you think of the Supreme Court's effort to curtail \n     Congress' power which began with the Lopez case back in 1995, \n     the Gun-Free School Zone Act. That was a very controversial \n     case. I remember my own view on that. I would have voted \n     against it, even though, obviously, I am for gun-free school \n     zones, but almost every Senator voted for it because they did \n     not want to sound like they were against gun-free school \n     zones, I guess, or whatever the reason might have been, but \n     it was a controversial issue and a hard issue to vote \n     against.\n\n  Mr. Estrada:\n\n       Yes, I know the case, Senator. As you may know, I was in \n     the Government at the time, and I argued a companion case to \n     Lopez that was pending at the same time and in which I took \n     the view that the United States was urging in the Lopez case \n     and in my case for a very expansive view of the power of \n     Congress to pass statutes under the commerce clause and have \n     them to be upheld by the court. Although my case, which was \n     the companion case to Lopez, was a win for the Government on \n     a very narrow theory, the court did reject the broad theory I \n     was urging on the court on behalf of the Government.\n\n  In other words, Mr. Estrada was sticking up for the very people who \nare saying he will not answer their questions. He was there. That was \nhis view, and he talks about it, and he answered the question:\n\n       Even though I worked very hard in that case to come up with \n     every conceivable argument for why the power of Congress \n     would be as vast as the mind could see, and told the court so \n     at oral argument, I understand I lost on that issue in that \n     case as an advocate, and I will be constrained to follow the \n     Lopez case.\n\n  Here we are, Mr. President. Mr. Estrada took a position that I would \nhave voted against. I think he is wrong, but he really did not take a \nposition that I would vote against him. He argued a case before the \ncourt that made the very best argument he could make, arguing two lines \nof opinions. What our friends on the other side are saying is, when he \nwrites a brief or argues a case on behalf of the United States, that \nsomehow that reflects the point of view with which they disagree. I \ndisagree with his brief. I would not consider voting against him or \nanybody else based on that kind of reason, a very complete answer.\n  Then if I may, I will state two more. Again, I would not normally \nthink it was necessary for me to read the questions and read the \nanswers, except that virtually every Senator from the other side who \nhas come in has said he has not answered the questions, so I want the \nAmerican people and my colleagues to know that if they want to know \nwhether he has answered the questions all they need to do is go to the \nhearing record and read the question and read the answer.\n  Here is a tough one from the Senator from California:\n\n       Do you believe that Roe v. Wade was correctly decided?\n\n  There is no more a difficult question for a judge who comes before \nthe Senate, because that is a terribly difficult issue about which we \nall have deeply held moral beliefs, and for all of us almost there is \nonly one right way to answer the question, unless one believes that \nwhat judges are supposed to do is to interpret the law and apply the \nlaw to the facts.\n  Mr. Estrada's answer:\n\n       My view on that judicial function, Senator Feinstein, does \n     not allow me to answer that question.\n\n  Then he goes on to explain what he meant.\n\n       I have a personal view on the subject of abortion, as I \n     think you know. But I have not done what I think the judicial \n     function would require me to do in order to ascertain whether \n     the Court got it right as an original matter. I have not \n     listened to the parties. I have not come to an actual case or \n     a controversy with an open mind. I have not gone back and run \n     down everything that they have cited. And the reason I have \n     not done any of those things is that I view our system of law \n     as one in which both me as an advocate and possibly, if I am \n     confirmed, as judge have the job of building on the wall that \n     is already there and not to call it into question. I have had \n     no particular reason to go back and look at whether it was \n     right or wrong as a matter of law, as I would if I were a \n     judge that was hearing the case for the first time. It is \n     there. It is the law, as has been subsequently refined by the \n     Casey case, and I will follow it.\n\n  That is a complete answer to the most difficult question that could \nbe asked of a nominee for a Federal judgeship.\n\n       Senator Feinstein: So you believe it is settled law?\n       Mr. Estrada: I believe so.\n\n  As I mentioned, if I understand the committee's rules, every Senator \non the committee has the ability to ask followup questions. I know when \nI was confirmed by the committee they asked me many followup questions \nand I worked hard answering the questions 10 or 12 years ago when I was \nin the first President Bush's Cabinet. These are serious questions and \nserious answers.\n  Here I think is a revealing question, and one which may give us some \nidea of why we are in the 10th day of debate on one of the most \nsuperbly qualified candidates ever nominated for the court of appeals, \na man who exemplifies the American dream. The Senator from \nMassachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, asked this question:\n\n       Mr. Estrada, do you consider yourself a ``conservative'' \n     lawyer? Why or why not? Why do you believe that you are being \n     promoted by your supporters as a conservative judicial \n     nominee? Do you believe that your judicial philosophy is akin \n     to that of Justices Scalia and Thomas? Why or why not?\n\n  What Senator Kennedy is looking for is to find out is this a \nconservative lawyer. Is the suggestion that we may want conservative \ndecisions or liberal decisions? I thought we wanted fair decisions, \nbased on precedent, based on fact. I thought we wanted judges who it \nwould be impossible for us to tell where they were coming from before \nthey were coming.\n\n  The response from Mr. Estrada is very interesting. He said to the \nSenator from Massachusetts:\n\n       My role as an attorney is to advocate my client's position \n     within ethical bounds rather than promote any particular \n     point of view, conservative or otherwise.\n\n  A-plus for that, I would say.\n  Mr. Estrada says:\n\n       I have worked as an attorney for a variety of clients, \n     including the United States Government, State and local \n     governments, individuals charged with criminal activity.\n\n  Are we going to say criminal lawyers cannot be confirmed because they \nrepresented people who murdered people and that makes them murderers?\n\n       Large corporations, indigent prisoners seeking Federal \n     habeas corpus, in those cases I have advocated a variety of \n     positions that might be characterized as either liberal or \n     conservative.\n\n  Remember, this is from a career employee in the U.S. Solicitor's \nOffice in the Clinton and Bush administrations. This is Miguel Estrada:\n\n       While I am grateful for the wide ranging and bipartisan \n     support that my nomination has received, I have no knowledge \n     of the specific reasons that might cause a particular \n     supporter of my nomination to promote my candidacy for \n     judicial office. As a judge I would view my job as trying to \n     reach the correct answer to the question before me without \n     being guided by any preconceptions or speculations as to how \n     any other judge or justice might approach the same issue.\n\n  If all of the Senators would take the time to read Miguel Estrada's \nanswers, some of them might end up in a textbook of appropriate \nanswers, if they believe a judge's job is to apply precedent and \nconsider the facts and come to a fair decision.\n  Miguel Estrada is qualified, and he is not just qualified, he is one \nof the most qualified persons ever nominated for\n\n[[Page S2792]]\n\nthe Federal court of appeals. If he, by his very candidacy, represents \nthe American dream that anything is possible, coming here from Honduras \nat age 17 and making his way through such a distinguished series of \nappointments, if he has answered the questions in what I would argue is \na superior way, the way most nominees would be capable of answering the \nquestions, and I have read just a few of them--I can come back and take \nanother 2 or 3 hours and read more because there are hours of questions \nand answers--and if a majority of Members of the Senate have signed a \nletter saying they would vote to confirm him, then why can we not vote \non Miguel Estrada?\n  The only reason can be that our Democratic friends want to change the \nway judges are selected. They want to say it takes 60 votes instead of \n51, and they want to say the criteria for winning those votes is to \nanswer the questions the way they want.\n  That will give us a Federal judiciary filled with partisans, or an \nempty Federal judiciary because we will be debating night after night \nbecause we cannot agree on whom to nominate and confirm. Such a \nprocess, if carried on in subsequent Congresses, will diminish the \nexecutive. It will diminish the judiciary. It will reduce the \nlikelihood that facts will be considered and that binding precedent \nwill apply. In other words, it will reduce the chance that justice will \nbe done. It will reduce respect for the courts because it will be \nassumed that if partisan views on the case are what it takes to get \nconfirmed by the Senate, then partisan views are what it takes to win a \ncase before the court.\n\n  It reminds me of the story we tell at home about the old Tennessee \njudge. He was in a rural county up in the mountains and the lawyers \nshowed up for a case one morning. He said: Gentlemen, we can save a lot \nof time. I received a telephone call last night. I pretty well know the \nfacts. All you need to do is give me a little memorandum on the law.\n  We do not want a judiciary where those who come before it believe the \njudges got their political instructions when they were confirmed and \nthat there is really no need to argue the case.\n  So Miguel Estrada is superbly qualified. Miguel Estrada has answered \nquestion after question, and he has done it very well. A majority of \nthe Senate has signed a letter saying they are ready to vote today to \nconfirm Miguel Estrada, and never in our history have we denied such a \nvote by filibuster to a circuit court judge. It is time to vote.\n  Before I finish my remarks, I make this pledge. I may be here long \nenough, and I hope it is a while, before I have an opportunity to cast \na vote for a nominee for a Federal judgeship that is sent over by a \nDemocratic President, but I can pledge now how I will cast my vote. It \nwill be the same way I appointed 50 judges when I was Governor. I look \nfor good character. I look for good intelligence. I look for good \ntemperament. I look for good understanding of the law and of the duties \nof judges. I will look to see if this nominee has the aspect of \ncourtesy to those who come before the court. I will reserve the right \nto vote against some extremists, but I will assume that it is \nunnecessary and unethical for the nominee to try to say to me how he or \nshe would decide a case that might come before him or her. When it \ncomes time to vote, when we finish that whole examination, I will vote \nto let the majority decide.\n  In plain English, I will not vote to deny a vote to a Democratic \nPresident's judicial nominee just because the nominee may have views \nmore liberal than mine. That is the way judges have always been \nselected. That is the way they should be selected.\n  I conclude in equally plain English, and with respect, I hope my \nfriends on the other side of the aisle would not deny a vote to Miguel \nEstrada just because they suspect his views on some issues may be more \nconservative than theirs.\n\n  These are the most serious times for our country. Our values are \nbeing closely examined in every part of the world. Our men and women \nare about to be asked, it appears, to fight a war in another part of \nthe world. How we administer our system of justice is one of the most \nimportant values they are defending. We need to constrain our partisan \ninstincts to get them under control. We need to avoid a result that \nchanges the way we select judges. In my view, we permanently damage our \nprocess for selecting Federal judges.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Before the Senator from Vermont is recognized, \nthe Chair congratulates the Senator from Tennessee for his initial \nspeech in this body.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I was about to congratulate the junior \nSenator from Tennessee on the same thing.\n  I am sorry that my good friend from Tennessee--whom I admire greatly; \nwe worked together when he was in the President's Cabinet; we worked on \nmany different things--I am sorry it happens to be a speech where he \nand I are on different sides. It was done with his usual care and \ncogency. He spoke to his experience, both as a former Governor with a \ndistinguished record, a former Cabinet member with a distinguished \nrecord, one who served in business with a distinguished record. I \nappreciate having him here.\n  Sometimes debate can get rancorous and personal. To hear someone who \ntakes a position, albeit different from mine, who does it with care, \nreflecting his past experience--I compliment the Senator from \nTennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we have heard a lot about Mr. Estrada and \nwhether he has or has not answered questions. Obviously, I believe he \nhas not. The President of the United States again today asked the \nSenate to do something that no President of either party should ask \nfor. He asked the Senate to vote without having straightforward answers \nfor a nominee for a lifetime position as a Federal judge on one of the \nmost significant courts of this country.\n  That is not something that would help the Federal judiciary, but \ninstead would set a dangerous precedent that would lessen the \nindependence of the Federal judiciary. When a nominee does not answer \nbasic questions, the Senate clearly has a constitutional responsibility \nto ask for the answers.\n  Mr. Estrada will not answer basic questions about his judicial \nphilosophy, yet he has asked the Senate to confirm him to a lifetime \njob to the second highest court in the land where that judicial \nphilosophy will determine, in many instances, which way that court will \nrule. That court affects every single American in countless ways \nthrough its decisions on everything from clean air and water to the \nrights of working men and women, from voting rights to all other civil \nrights law that protect minorities.\n  Becoming a Federal judge for a lifetime is a privilege, not a right. \nNo nominee should be rewarded for stonewalling the Senate and the \nAmerican people. The Constitution directs Senators to use their \njudgment in voting on judicial nominees, not to rubberstamp them.\n  The Democratic-controlled Senate confirmed a record 100 of President \nBush's judicial nominees, acting faster and more fairly than the \nRepublicans did with President Clinton's nominees. We began the process \nof the first hearing within 10 minutes of the time I became chairman of \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  But President Bush has also proposed several controversial nominees, \nsuch as Miguel Estrada, who divide the American people and the Senate. \nThe President can end this impasse. I hope he will act to give Senators \nthe answers they need to make informed judgments about this nomination. \nThe President can also help by choosing mainstream judicial nominees \nwho can unite instead of divide the American people. The White House \nknows very well how easily and quickly they can bring this matter \nforward for a vote. They would rather make a political statement than \nto have a vote on a nomination.\n  Especially at a time when we have so many other issues before us--it \nhas been said a record number of Americans are out of work--when a \nrecord number of jobs are being lost in this country, when more jobs \nare being lost under the President than any President, certainly in my \nlifetime, we are going to spend week after week in the Senate regarding \nan extremely highly paid lifetime job for one person.\n  It would seem a little bit more fair to those who do not have \nlifetime jobs, to\n\n[[Page S2793]]\n\nthose who are not paid this amount, to the millions of Americans who \nhave lost jobs during the last 2 years, to talk about ways of putting \nthem back to work. I hope the President will pay attention to that.\n  I said more people have lost jobs during his Presidency than during \nthe Presidency of certainly every President I have served with, and I \nbelieve any President in my lifetime.\n  We should be talking about preserving prescription drugs. Senator \nFeingold will introduce the Preserving Prescription Drug Discount Act \ntomorrow. I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of this important \nlegislation. It will address an issue of great concern to me and to so \nmany of the moderates. American drug companies threaten to stop doing \nbusiness with Canadian pharmacies. How does this affect us? Every one \nof us who is in a State that comes along the Canadian border is \naffected. This legislation is a response to the announcement by \npharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline to stop supplying Canadian \npharmacies that provide American consumers the same prices the \nCanadians receive.\n\n  It is a sad commentary that the richest, most powerful nation on \nEarth has so many of our citizens who are forced to choose between \nbuying necessities such as food and heat and the prescription drugs \nthey need to live healthy, productive lives. Many Vermonters in these \ndifficult circumstances cross the border into Canada to purchase \nprescription drugs at dramatically lower prices, sometimes saving up to \n80 percent. There is a need for lower cost prescription drugs. It is \nunconscionable that at a time when pharmaceutical industry profits are \nsoaring, a company such as Glaxo targets the most vulnerable consumers \nin order to protect what is for them a very large bottom line.\n  When we have 45 million Americans, most of them working Americans, \nwho do not have medical insurance in this country, we have millions out \nof jobs and who have lost their jobs in the last 2 years, we ought to \nat least stand up and tell this pharmaceutical giant: Do not cut off \nthis lifeline.\n  Vermont is so often at the forefront of developing innovative \nstrategy to combat high health care costs, including announcing a \npartnership with Michigan and Wisconsin to buy prescription drugs in \nbulk. This will save the residents of these three States millions of \ndollars, and it is a step in the right direction toward making \nprescription drugs more affordable for our citizens.\n  Unfortunately, for the same consumers, Glaxo's new proposal \nrepresents a giant step backward. Both chambers of the Vermont State \nLegislature responded swiftly and passed a resolution regarding Glaxo's \ntroubling plan, urging the company to reverse its policies. The Vermont \nlawmakers even went so far as to suggest it may consider requiring all \nof Glaxo's prescriptions to be considered through a review process \nbefore they could be prescribed to State-funded programs.\n  The Preserving Prescription Drug Discounts Act that my friend, \nSenator Feingold, will introduce tomorrow, goes one step further than \nthe Vermont House's recommendation.\n  Under this bill, companies that discriminate against Canadian \npharmacies that pass along discounts to American consumers would not be \nallowed to deduct expenses related to research and development from \ntheir taxes.\n  Glaxco's policy would punish American consumers. There is no other \nway to describe it. It is not a policy that American taxpayers should \nsupport with Government benefits such as tax credits when they openly \nact to punish American consumers. We American consumers are also \nAmerican taxpayers and should not have to give them even further \nbenefits.\n  I hope the quick passage of this measure will prompt Glaxco to \nreconsider its policy. It is a wrong policy. It is a mean policy. It is \nan irresponsible policy. I hope other companies will think twice before \ncopying such a mean and irresponsible policy.\n  We have a responsibility to take the steps necessary to ensure that \nour citizens have access to health care, including prescription drugs \nthey need and deserve.\n  I have worked over the years to ease access to generic drugs, to \nensure privacy for individuals' medical records, and to continue to \nwork to ensure that our seniors and individuals with disabilities would \nsoon have a voluntary prescription drug benefit as part of Medicare.\n  The health care challenges facing our Nation are complex. The \nsolutions are not easy. It may take some time to find the necessary \nsolutions to these challenges. In the meantime, we must embrace the \nissues we can promptly address. That is what the Preserving Description \nDrug Discounts Act will do. I hope other Senators will join in \nsupporting Senator Feingold.\n  Mr. President, as I said, I think it is unfortunate. This matter \ncould easily be resolved. The White House is uninterested in doing \nthat.\n  The President's Counsel almost derisively dismissed a suggestion made \nby one of the respected senior Republicans in this body for resolving \nthis issue. It makes me think they do not want to bring this to a vote. \nThey would rather talk about bringing this to a vote. That does very \nlittle for either the independence of the Federal judiciary, and \ncertainly the question of the independence of the Senate.\n  At times I get the impression the White House considers the Senate \nsome kind of a constitutional nuisance to be ignored. It is almost as \nthough they issue marching orders, and the Senate should fall in line, \nfrom how we should organize on through.\n  Presidents come and go. I respect all the Presidents and admire their \nwillingness to lead our great country. But the Senate stays here long \nafter any individual President. We either fulfill our obligations of \nadvice and consent or we become a rubberstamp. Prior to my becoming \nchairman, for 6 months the Republican majority of that time did not \nhold a single hearing on any of President Bush's judicial nominees. In \n17 months I held hearings on 103, we confirmed 100, and voted down 2. \nThat is on top of hundreds upon hundreds of other nominees for \neverything from U.S. Marshals to the Director of the INS to the head of \nthe Drug Enforcement Agency to the U.S. attorneys. It was pretty \nproductive.\n  When I listen to some of the statements being made by my friends on \nthe other side, you would think we did nothing. Maybe they are thinking \nof the months upon months upon months when they would not move any \njudges for President Clinton and do not want to look at the fact that \nwe were moving them almost every week. We had to, during 17 months. \nDuring those 17 months we had recesses, adjournments, anthrax attacks, \nthe Senate being closed down after September 11. We kept turning out \nthese judges.\n  Many were controversial. Most were conservative. We kept turning them \nout. Maybe to obscure the fact that we were moving President Bush's \njudges much faster than the Republicans moved President Clinton's, when \nwe actually dared vote against one, the attacks that came. We were \nmisquoted for our reasons. We had a judge who was defeated basically on \nquestions of competence and willingness to follow the law. The \nDemocrats who voted against him had all kinds of motives ascribed to \nthem. We were told we called him a racist, even though I heard \nDemocratic Senator after Democratic Senator say they did not consider \nhim that. We had the religion of the majority of Members, Democratic \nMembers in the Senate, attacked--including high officials of the \nRepublican Party attacked the religious backgrounds of at least 8 \nmembers of the 10 members, Democrats in the Senate Judiciary Committee. \nBut nobody, nobody wanted to discuss the fact that this particular \njudge was voted down because he was not qualified to be a circuit court \nof appeals judge.\n  These are the kinds of things. It is almost like no good deed will go \nunpunished. The Democrats moved through judges much faster for \nPresident Bush than Republicans did for President Clinton, and we are \nthe ones being called obstructionists.\n  Mr. Estrada's short legal career has been successful. By all accounts \nhe is a good appellate lawyer and legal advocate who has had a series \nof prestigious positions and is professionally and financially \nsuccessful. As the grandson of immigrants, as a son, a father and \ngrandfather, I know that no matter the\n\n[[Page S2794]]\n\ncountry of origin or economic background, a family takes pride in the \nsuccess of its children. Mr. Estrada's family has much to be proud of \nin his accomplishments, regardless of the outcome of this nomination.\n\n  Mr. Estrada, who is now 41 years old, has a successful legal career \nat a prominent corporate law firm, which was the firm of President \nReagan's first Attorney General William French Smith and that of \nPresident Bush's current Solicitor General Ted Olson. I am told that \nMr. Olson, along with Kenneth Starr have been among Mr. Estrada's \nconservative mentors. At his relatively young age, Mr. Estrada has \nbecome a partner in the law firm of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher having \npreviously worked with the Wall Street law firm of Wachtell, Lipton, \nRosen & Katz. While in private practice his clients included major \ninvestment backs and health care providers. Mr. Estrada's financial \nstatement, which Senator Hatch inserted into the Congressional Record, \nsays that he earned more than $500,000 a year two years ago and makes \nhim look like a millionaire. At his hearing, Mr. Estrada testified: ``I \nhave never known what it is to be poor, and I am very thankful to my \nparents for that. And I have never known what it is to be incredibly \nrich either, or even very rich, or rich.'' I will let his financial \nstatement speak for itself on that point.\n  Mr. Estrada appears to be a highly successful and well-compensated \nlawyer in a first-rate law firm. As I say, his family and friends \nsurely take pride in this success, and rightly so.\n  In the almost six years he has been with Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, \nwith its thriving appellate court practice and the successful Supreme \nCourt practice developed by his senior partner Ted Olson, who was \nconfirmed to be Solicitor General in June 2001, Mr. Estrada has \napparently had only one argument before the Supreme Court, however. \nThat was in connection with a habeas petition on which he worked pro \nbono when he first came to the firm. This is also one of the only pro \nbono cases he has taken in his entire legal career.\n  I would also note his role developing legal arguments and writing \nbriefs on behalf of Governor Bush following the 2000 election that \nresulted in a 5 to 4 majority of the United States Supreme Court's \nintervention to halt the counting of ballots in Florida and resulting \nin the selection of President George W. Bush. This information failed \nto make it into Mr. Estrada's Judiciary Committee questionnaire and \nlist of top 10 legal matters. We know about his involvement in that \ncase because the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education asked him \nabout it and included reference to it in their extensive report on this \nnomination.\n  Much has been said of Mr. Estrada's time working in the Office of the \nSolicitor General at the Department of Justice. I understand he was \nhired for that role by Kenneth Starr when he was the Solicitor General \nfor the first President Bush in 1992. It was in that government post \nwhich Mr. Estrada continued during the first term of the Clinton \nadministration in which he had 14 opportunities to argue before the \nSupreme Court. Of course, one of the principal functions of the \nSolicitor General's Office is to argue for the Government in behalf of \nthe Supreme Court, and in fact argues more than anybody else. So it is \nno surprise when attorneys do so.\n  But there comes the rub. Mr. Estrada's supporters make much of his \nfour and a half years in the Solicitor General's Office and say this \nqualifies him to an appointment to the DC Circuit. The work that he \ndid, according to the supporters in the Solicitor General's Office, \nipso facto qualifies him for appointment to the District of Columbia \nCircuit. But when we ask, Can we see the work he did? Oh, no, no. Take \nour word for it.\n  Interestingly enough, when I asked Mr. Estrada during the first \nmeeting we had whether he had any objection to turning over the \nmaterial and the work he did, he said no. He would be glad to. He is \nproud of it. It reflected his views. He would be glad to turn it over. \nWhen he was asked during the hearings whether he would be willing to \nturn it over, he personally would be willing to do so. He was under \noath and he said certainly. But the administration says no.\n  The Administration is seeking to have it both ways: Credit Mr. \nEstrada with the experience while forbidding the Senate from reviewing \nfor itself what he did in that government job. Given the public \ncomments of a former Deputy Solicitor General and Mr. Estrada's direct \nsupervisor at the Office of Solicitor General, as well as the lack of a \nwritten record of Mr. Estrada's views and judicial philosophy and Mr. \nEstrada's failure at his hearing to satisfy Senators by responding to \ntheir questions, there is ample basis on which to request the \nproduction of government work papers from the time during which Mr. \nEstrada was in the Solicitor General's Office. There is also ample \nprecedent for such papers being shared with the Senate in the past.\n  It makes you wonder why they won't show us Mr. Estrada's paperwork. \nThe same paperwork that was made available during the Carter \nadministration. It was made available during the Reagan administration. \nIt has been made available actually every time the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee has asked for it.\n  The Democratic leader pointed out the way to resolve the stalemate in \nhis February 11, 2003, letter. It is curious. We asked for materials of \ncases long since decided. We are not asking for material on a pending \ncase. Certainly, if there is material on a pending case, I would be \nwilling to listen to an argument to hold that back. But how can we \nargue to hold back on material on a case long decided?\n  When similar requests were made of material written by William \nRehnquist, it was forthcoming. When similar requests were made for \nmaterial written by Robert Bork, it was forthcoming. When similar \nmaterial was requested written by Benjamin Civiletti, who became \nAttorney General, it was forthcoming. When similar material was \nrequested for the nomination of William Bradford Reynolds, it was \nforthcoming. When similar material was requested for the nomination of \nSteven Trott, it was forthcoming. But then when it is requested of Mr. \nEstrada--and this is the only time I can remember such a request being \nturned down--it is turned down.\n\n  Again, you have to ask why. What is in there that they don't want us \nto see?\n  Take the public comments of a former Deputy Solicitor General, Mr. \nEstrada's direct supervisor at the Office of Solicitor General, as well \nas the lack of a written record of Mr. Estrada's views and judicial \nphilosophy and Mr. Estrada's failure during hearings to satisfy \nSenators by responding to their questions, then there is ample bases on \nwhich to request products of Government workpapers during the time in \nwhich Mr. Estrada was in the Solicitor General's Office--papers put \ntogether and being paid for by the taxpayers in a job which the \nadministration now says shows why he is entitled to be in this lifetime \nposition. There is ample precedent for such papers being shared with \nthe Senate in the past.\n  I cannot think of a time when the papers were requested when the \nadministration turned them down.\n  Professor Bender, Mr. Estrada's supervisor at the Office of the \nSolicitor General, indicated that when he was supervising Mr. Estrada \nhe did not view Mr. Estrada as reading the law fairly. He viewed Mr. \nEstrada as one whose personal views and desires colored his readings \nand presentations of the law, and as someone who might well be an \nideologue to be appointed to the bench.\n  I would think if Senators are going to be fair about this nomination, \nwhether they are Republicans or Democrats, they would want to know the \nanswer to that before they put somebody in a lifetime position.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I would prefer not to until I finish these comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Thank you.\n  But the reason we say this, if this work is what qualifies him, then \nwe ought to know what he did in this work.\n  Now, Professor Bender, Mr. Estrada's supervisor, is reported to have \nstated that Mr. Estrada was so ``ideologically driven that he couldn't \nbe trusted to state the law in a fair, neutral way.'' He stated that he \n``could not rely on [Mr. Estrada's] written work to be a neutral \nstatement of the law.'' He also\n\n[[Page S2795]]\n\nindicated that he viewed Mr. Estrada as ``smart and charming, but he is \na right-wing ideologue'' and one who ``lacks judgment.''\n  Now, this is somebody who has actually seen his work. Unlike those of \nus who are not allowed to see it, he has seen it.\n  Veteran Supreme Court lawyer Carter G. Phillips has also noted that \nMr. Estrada, while ``extremely self-confident'' is a ``more strident \npersonality'' than the other current nominee for this court, John \nRoberts.\n  In fact, when Professor Bender ventured these honest opinions, he \nsuffered partisan attacks by Republicans. Similar to what happened to \nthose of us on the Democratic side on the Judiciary Committee, who had \nour religion attacked by Republican officeholders because we dared to \nvote against one of President Bush's nominees, Professor Bender was \nattacked because he dared to question one of President Bush's nominees.\n  He was maligned for serving as the general counsel to a commission \nappointed by President Nixon. He was maligned for legal positions taken \nby the Clinton administration. Republicans have chosen character \nassassination and demonization of Professor Bender. Their approach is \nto deny access to Government records and to seek to destroy anyone who \nwould raise a concern about Mr. Estrada's ideology affecting his legal \nwork.\n  To his credit, Professor Bender was not intimidated by these personal \nattacks. He wrote to Chairman Hatch reaffirming his views just days \nago. He also did this because he found that he was being misquoted time \nand time again on the floor of the Senate, and he wanted us to know \nexactly what his views are.\n  Contrast this to what the Senate Democrats are trying to do. We would \nlike to get to the merits of the matter. The administration has \nresponded by stonewalling our request. They have attacked us for our \nattempts to reach a fair resolution of this matter.\n  I would like to have the papers. I would like to have a hearing where \nwe could ask questions from the papers, where we actually know what is \nin these things that they say substantiate the reason for Mr. Estrada's \nnomination.\n  The administration wants to have it both ways. They say, if you saw \nthese brilliant writings, then you would want him to be a judge. So we \nsay: Fine, let's see the writings. They say: Oh, no, you can't see \nthem. Take our word.\n  You can't really have it both ways. If this is what shows he is \nqualified to be a judge, then let us see what is in it and then let us \nmake up our own minds. Then Senators can vote for or against, but at \nleast they will know what it is based on.\n  One major person in his department says he is not qualified. We are \nnot relying on that. We would like to see the papers and make up our \nown mind.\n  One of the significant questions raised by this nomination is whether \nMr. Estrada will be a fair judge without a political agenda. To \nascertain that, let's review his work when he was serving in a position \nof trust for the United States, paid for by the American taxpayers.\n  I believe it is fair to explore whether Mr. Estrada stated the law in \na fair and neutral way while asked to do so in the Solicitor General's \nOffice. Remember, the Solicitor General is not just an advocate before \nthe U.S. Supreme Court. The Solicitor General is that unique person, in \narguing before the U.S. Supreme Court, who is expected--by the Court \nand by the American people--to state the law objectively.\n\n  I have heard the Solicitor General before the U.S. Supreme Court--in \nyears past, and even from my days in law school--saying things to the \neffect: Here is the law that would uphold the position of the \nGovernment, but the Court should be aware that there is another body of \nlaw on the other side. They are supposed to state it fairly and \nimpartially so the Court can rely on them.\n  Having said that, we have somebody in the Solicitor General's Office \npreparing this material so that the Supreme Court can be given an \nobjective, fair, and evenhanded view of the law. Isn't it fair game to \nask whether that person fulfilled their duty in the Solicitor General's \nOffice? Isn't it fair to ask, when they prepared such material, whether \nthey did it in a fair, evenhanded fashion? Or did they do it in an \nideological manner? Did they do it to carry out an agenda?\n  I think it is a particularly significant question. We are faced with \na nominee for a lifetime appointment to a Federal court, and to a \nFederal court as important as the D.C. Circuit. Usually when somebody \nis being nominated to such an important court, they have been a judge, \nthey have been a district court judge, they have had a position where \nyou have been able to see how they interpret the law and how they use \nit, and whether they did so fairly.\n  That is not the case here. Here we have one place--one place--where \nby law, custom, and practice he is required to state the law in an \nevenhanded fashion, not ideologically driven but impartially driven. \nAnd the one place where we can ask whether he did that or not, the \nadministration says: Trust us. He did, but we will not show you.\n  I remember that wonderful saying that President Reagan made up, to \nthe great surprise of the Russians, because he said it was a Russian \nsaying it; but, still, it is a wonderful saying, where he said: Trust \nbut verify. Well, I am tied at the hip with former President Reagan on \nthis one. I will trust, but I would like to verify. I would like to \nverify.\n  I think Senators should have the opportunity to review for themselves \nthe documents Mr. Estrada wrote and make their own independent \njudgments about Mr. Estrada's writings and his ability to apply the law \nwithout regard to strongly held personal beliefs.\n  Objectivity and openmindedness are crucial to appellate deliberations \nand decisionmaking. This is an area where we could answer that \nquestion. We can answer the question. In the Office of the Solicitor \nGeneral there is a requirement to be objective, not ideological, a \nrequirement to be straightforward and not political. But we are not \nallowed to see whether he fulfilled that requirement. Don't you think \nwe should at least ask if it was there?\n  If he had been a district judge before, and had written opinions, \nwhich would show whether he was objective and evenhanded, wouldn't we \nsay, let's read them? I cannot imagine any Republican or Democrat \nsaying we would not read them before we made up our mind.\n  Well, he was not a district judge. But he was in a position where he \nwas required to be nonideological, where he was required to be honest, \nwhere he was required to be straightforward, where he was required to \nbe nonpolitical, and we are not allowed to see that record.\n  Let's see the record. Let us ask questions about it, especially in \nthis case, where one of the people who has looked at the record--one of \nhis supervisors--questions whether he was objective. Isn't that \nsomething we should determine? In a job where he was required by law, \nby practice, and by custom to be objective and nonideological, and \nintellectually honest, if you have somebody who says he was not, so \nshouldn't we know that? Because if that is the case--when he is there \njust for a term--how much worse will it be if it is a lifetime \nposition?\n  Let's have those papers. Let's ask the questions. Then let Senators \nmake up their minds. I am never going to vote for a judge if I cannot \nhave the answers. I remember when President Clinton had nominees held \nup here for 2, 3, 4 years. My friends on the Republican side asked \nquestion after question. Some were legitimate, some were not. I \nremember one being asked how she voted on a secret ballot in a State \nelection. I think we can all agree that is a question nobody should be \nasked--how they vote in an election in a State. But we waited year \nafter year, and they said they must have these answers. Shouldn't we?\n  I heard that Mr. Estrada was editor of the Harvard Law Review. Some \nhave gone so far as to make it seem as if he was editor in chief or \npresident of the review. That would be pretty impressive. Actually, he \nwas one of 70 student editors working at the Harvard Law Review in \n1986. That should be impressive enough. I think most law students would \nsay that is pretty darn impressive. But you don't have to embellish it, \nas some of his supporters have, and make it far more than what it was. \nI am impressed that he was 1 of 70. You don't have to embellish it to \nsay he was the No. 1 editor in chief.\n\n[[Page S2796]]\n\n  We have a lot of people who fall into that category. Claire Sylvia, \nwho worked for a time at our Senate legal counsel's office, was one of \nthose editors. I never remember her claiming to be the editor in chief.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Did I hear the Senator right that all these statements I \nhave heard on the Senate floor that he was the editor--in fact, he was \none of 70 editors?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Yes, 70.\n  Mr. REID. That is a distinction, but it is not the editor in chief.\n  Mr. LEAHY. That is what I am saying. We have had a lot of people who \nworked for the Senate and for our committees and worked for various \nSenator's offices who have been one of those 70. It is a proud \nachievement. I keep worrying when we are seeing somebody gilding the \nlily on this person, when we see his background and his history change \nconstantly to make it better and better. Well, he has things to be \nproud of, but you wonder why his supporters have to constantly change \nit and embellish it.\n  Jeff Toobin, who has become a journalist, author, and legal \ncommentator, was a student editor there that year. Actually, the \nsupervising editor, who had a far more significant position, was none \nother than Elena Kagan. I mention this because my friends on the other \nside said that Mr. Estrada's being one of the 70 editors is reason to \nbe on the court. Elena Kagan was a supervising editor. Now, that is \nreally significant. Professor Kagan is a Harvard law professor. \nProfessor Kagan served as Mr. Estrada's supervising editor, got the \nhighest qualification by the ABA; and based on those qualifications, \nPresident Clinton nominated her to the DC Circuit.\n  I mention this because so much has been made by those on the other \nside, who say even if you are one of the 70 editors, and got a high \nqualification from the ABA, that should be enough. Elena Kagan was a \nlaw professor and was a supervising editor. She was nominated by \nPresident Clinton, but guess what happened. The Republicans never \nallowed her to even have a hearing, to say nothing of a vote. She was \nhumiliated, not even allowed to have a hearing, to say nothing about a \nvote.\n  I worry when I hear Mr. Estrada's supporters talk about his family \nhistory. I was impressed when talking to him about his family. But I \nremember the first stories, and you have heard them repeated here. You \nalmost thought he was a barefoot immigrant coming to America, unable to \nspeak English, and so on and so forth. Actually, he grew up in a \nrelatively wealthy and privileged household. His parents sent him to \nprivate school in Honduras, where the annual cost was almost the same \nas the annual per capita income for most Hondurans during that period.\n\n  According to news accounts, his late father was a prominent and \npolitically conservative lawyer who helped found the country's first \nprivate university and was also a bank vice president.\n  I recall that the Honduran Ambassador took time out from his busy \nschedule last fall to attend a Judiciary Committee hearing, which made \nme think about the rumors that had circulated that Mr. Estrada's family \nincluded relatives who had been on the country's diplomatic corps. I \nunderstand his mother was a successful accountant in her own right. She \nshould be proud of that. She is the daughter of a teacher-diplomat. Mr. \nEstrada completed 12 years of primary and secondary education at a \nprivate academy and at a university where he studied English. These are \nall commendable things--but a lot different than the image we are \ngiven.\n  Again I ask, why not just tell the story as it is? Why not tell the \nstory straightforward and show us the papers straightforward? Why do \nyou have to constantly embellish things? That is why when I am told by \nthe administration: Just trust us, we have looked at the papers and he \nwas objective and honest and nonideological, take our word for it--I \nhaven't been able to take their word for much in this case so far. Why \nshould I take it for something that they don't want me to see?\n  We do know some things about him. According to news accounts, after \none of his mentors, Kenneth Starr, left the Office of the Solicitor \nGeneral, he said Estrada was ``left working for a Justice Department \nwhose views he didn't always agree with.''\n  While at the Solicitor General's Office, Estrada did argue 14 cases \nbefore the Supreme Court, primarily criminal matters, but sometimes in \nthe area of banking law. It is worth noting that Seth Waxman was not \nlisted as Solicitor General on the briefs of any of those cases and, \napparently, did not directly supervise his work.\n  When he joined Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher and worked with Ted Olsen, Mr. \nEstrada gave interviews in which he defended Ken Starr's investigation \nof President Clinton. He has a right to do that. Some of us would \nquestion the $75 million to $100 million that was wasted on the \ninvestigations, but Mr. Estrada felt they were well worthwhile. He \nhelped on then-Governor George Bush's litigation over the election \nresults in Florida. He went on to the Justice Department transition \nteam.\n  I outline this personal history because some partisans have taken \nliberties with Mr. Estrada's personal and professional background in \norder to try to make his case more compelling. There is no doubt that \nMr. Estrada is a rising star in conservative legal circles. He is a \nFederalist Society member and has been mentored by Kenneth Starr and \nTed Olson.\n  Certainly, he has a right to be involved with the Federalist Society. \nThere is nothing wrong with that. In fact, he should probably use the \nmembership.\n  One judicial nominee at his hearing was honest and said he hadn't \nreally heard of the Federalist Society. But he was told if he wanted to \nbe a judge with this administration, he better go join it. He did and \nhe is a judge. It worked for him. In this case, it has served him well, \nas it has a number of other executive branch nominees.\n  This organization is sometimes mischaracterized as a mere debating \nsociety, and, as I said, one nominee was very honest while under oath \nand said: Yes, he was told to join it.\n  They say about themselves:\n\n       The Federalist Society for Law and Public Policy Studies is \n     a group of conservatives and libertarians interested in the \n     current state of the legal order.\n\n  They state one of their goals is the ``reordering of priorities \nwithin the legal system'' and its objective ``requires restoring the \nrecognition of the importance of lawyers, judges, and law professors.''\n  I am not sure how Mr. Estrada plans to reorder priorities and values \nif he is confirmed as a judge, but we know he has strongly held views \nhe will not share with us. Again, we go back to the one area where he \nis required to be objective, not ideological, and nonpolitical, and \nthat it in the Office of the Solicitor General. But those writings we \nare not allowed to see. Those writings would show if he is able to be \nnonideological, nonpolitical, and straightforward because he is \nrequired to in the Solicitor General's Office, but they will not show \nus what he wrote.\n  What worries me is that a man who has had so many embellishments made \non his record by his supporters, when his supporters question \neverything from the religion to the biases of those who dare question \nhim, it makes one wonder why do they hide this.\n  In his hearing testimony, Mr. Estrada did admit ``having made some \npretty ruthless assessments and the legal views of some [government] \nagencies which I'm glad to say were sometimes vindicated in the courts \nlater. . . .\n  He did not tell us what those assessments were. He did not say which \ncases vindicated his views. We are left to wonder whether given the \nawesome power of a lifetime appointment as a Federal judge that he \nwould act on his own ``ruthless assessments'' or on the facts, the \nlitigants, and the law before him.\n  His friends and supporters acknowledge that Mr. Estrada has strong \nconservative views. In fact, they acknowledge far more than Mr. Estrada \nhimself. His classmate Arturo Corrales, a former Presidential candidate \nin Honduras, said Mr. Estrada's socially conservative views were \nalready evidenced when he was a teenager, including his opposition to \nabortion. Other colleagues acknowledge his strong views as well. His \nformer law school classmate, Ron Klain, supports him even though Mr. \nEstrada is ``politically conservative'' and ``has passionate views\n\n[[Page S2797]]\n\nabout legal policy.'' His former colleague Robert Litt supports Mr. \nEstrada's confirmation, even though he disagrees with his ``legal \nphilosophy.''\n  They do so, however, with the luxury of knowing what Mr. Estrada's \nviews of the Constitution are. That is a luxury that 100 Members of \nthis body do not have. Mr. Estrada refused to share those views with \nthose entrusted by the Constitution with determining whether he should \nbe accorded the power of a lifetime Federal judicial appointment. The \nSenate wants to know before making that decision whether he can be \ntrusted to apply the law fairly and impartially without regard to his \ndeeply held ideas and views, whatever they may be. It is hard to \nimagine that he would freely cast his views aside and be objective in a \ncourt when he will not even tell us what they are.\n  Members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus who met with him noted \nthat Mr. Estrada ``did not demonstrate a sense of inherent `unfairness' \nor `justice' in cases that have had a great impact on the Hispanic \ncommunity.''\n\n  They noted that, in their view, the ``appointment of a Latino to \nreflect diversity is rendered meaningless unless the nominee can \ndemonstrate an understanding of the historical role courts have played \nin the lives of minorities in extending equal protections and rights.''\n  Similar concerns have been raised by the Latino Vermonters and many \nothers. For example, the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education \nFund--this is a national civil rights organization concerned with \nadvancing the civil and human rights of the Latino community, also \nsubmitted a strong statement of opposition, and they reviewed all his \navailable writings.\n  They conducted dozens of interviews with individuals who have studied \nand worked with Miguel Estrada, and well as those who lived in the same \ncommunities with him. They also surveyed news reports and public \nmaterials concerning Mr. Estrada.\n  They also interviewed Mr. Estrada. They noted that ``a number of his \ncolleagues have said unequivocally that Mr. Estrada has expressed \nextreme views that they believe to be outside the mainstream of legal \nand political thought.''\n  They go further to say that he has ``made strong statements that have \nbeen interpreted as hostile to defendants' rights, affirmative action, \nand women's rights.''\n  They also expressed concern about his temperament. They interviewed \npeople who described him as ``arrogant and elitist'' and that he \n``harangues his colleagues'' and ``doesn't listen to other people.'' In \ntheir interview, Mr. Estrada was not even tempered and was \n``contentious, confrontational, aggressive and even offensive in his \nverbal exchanges'' with them.\n  After a thorough review, the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education \nFund concluded that Mr. Estrada was not sufficiently qualified for a \nlifetime seat on the Nation's second highest court, and then the PRLDEF \nsaid ``that his reportedly extreme views should be disqualifying; that \nhe has not had a demonstrated interest in or involvement with the \norganized Hispanic community or Hispanic activities of any; and that he \nlacks the maturity and judicial temperament necessary to be a circuit \njudge.''\n  Similarly, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund, \nMALDEF, and California La Raza Lawyers, CLRL, have expressed ``serious \nconcerns about whether Mr. Estrada would fairly review issues that came \nbefore him. MALDEF and CLRL said:\n\n       [I]t is unclear whether he would be fair to Latino \n     plaintiffs as well as others who would appear before him with \n     claims under the first amendment, the fourth amendment, the \n     fifth amendment, and due process clauses in the U.S. \n     Constitution. Further, we found evidence that suggests he may \n     not serve as a fair and impartial jurist on allegations \n     brought before him in the areas of racial profiling, \n     immigration, and abusive or improper police practices where \n     those practices are adopted under a ``broken window theory'' \n     of law enforcement. We have concerns about whether he would \n     fairly review standing issues for organizations representing \n     minority interests, affirmative action programs, or claims by \n     low-income consumers. We are also unsure, after a careful \n     review of his record, whether he would fairly protect labor \n     rights of immigrant workers or the rights of minority voters \n     under the Voting Rights Act.\n\n  These are leading Latino organizations that say that about him.\n  We have heard from numerous chamber of commerce-related organizations \nand Republican organizations expressing support, the same Republican \norganizations able to send five people to Vermont to talk about him. \nThey were really silent when other Latinos were nominated to the court \nby President Clinton. There are Latino judges out there; 80 percent of \nthe Latinos on the courts of appeals now were appointed by President \nClinton. There actually would have been several more, but they were \nblocked by the Republicans. They were not allowed to have hearings, \nthey were not allowed to have votes, and none of these Republican \norganizations that are suddenly concerned about the plight of Latinos \ncame forward when one after another was blocked by the Republicans \nduring the Clinton administration.\n  The spokesperson for the newly minted Coalition for a Fair \nJudiciary--I love these terms--explains that organization is made up of \n70 or more conservative organizations, arose from a similar group \ncalled Americans for Ashcroft and is supportive of President Bush's \njudicial nominees because of their ideology.\n  We are not allowed to question ideology, but the supporters say \nbecause of their ideology they should be confirmed.\n  Diversity is one of the great strengths of our Nation, and that \ndiversity and background should be reflected in our Federal courts. I \nonly wish some of these same conservative organizations suddenly \navailable today were interested in diversity when President Clinton's \nminority women nominees were being delayed and derailed by Senate \nRepublicans between 1996 and 2001. They were nowhere to be found or \nworse yet, arguing for delay, obstruction and defeat of those qualified \nHispanic, African-American and female nominees.\n\n  Race or ethnicity and gender are, of course, no substitutes for the \nwisdom, experience, fairness, and impartiality that qualify someone to \nbe a federal judge entrusted with a lifetime appointment. White men \nshould get no presumption of competence or entitlement. Hispanic and \nAfrican American men and women should not be presumed to be \nincompetent. All nominees should be treated fairly.\n  When one gets down to the bottom line, the burden of proof of \nsuitability for lifetime appointment rests on the nominee and the \nAdministration. We must carefully examine the records of all nominees \nto high offices, but we know the benefits of diversity and how it \ncontributes to achieving and improving justice in America. As Antonia \nHernandez wrote in the Wall Street Journal: ``The fact that a nominee \nis Latino should not be a shield from full inquiry, particularly when a \nnominee's record is sparse, as in Mr. Estrada's case. It is vital to \nknow more about a nominee's philosophies for interpreting and applying \nthe Constitution and the laws.'' Members of the Congressional Hispanic \nCaucus has said much the same thing.\n  Our freedoms are the fruit of too much sacrifice to fail to assure \nourselves that the judges we vote to confirm have a commitment to \nupholding the Constitution, following precedent, and listening to \nclaims without fear or favor. When a President is nominating \nindividuals to tip the balance, stack the deck, or to pack the courts \nwith ideologues, the Senate would be abdicating its responsibilities to \nignore the very criteria that led to selection of such a nominee.\n  So, when some organizations come forward and say they are supporting \na nominee because of their ideology, they cannot at the same time say \nwe should not ask about that ideology. When the supporters come forward \nand say his brilliant writings in the Solicitor General's Office \nqualify him to be a judge, they cannot then in the next breath say, but \nyou cannot see what those brilliant writings were, you have to take our \nword for it.\n  Under our Founders' design, the political branches share the power of \nappointment: the President has the power to nominate or propose judges, \nbut the Senate has a corresponding power to confirm or reject those \nnominations. That is one of the ingenious checks and balances of our \nfederal system. If a nominee's record, or lack of a record, raises \ndoubts, these are matters for\n\n[[Page S2798]]\n\nthorough scrutiny by the Senate, which is entrusted to review all of \nthe information and materials relevant to a nominee's record relating \nto fairness, impartiality, bias, experience, or other matters.\n  Unlike elected officials, these are lifetime jobs, so the Senate \nJudiciary Committee must undertake an inquiry to be assured that a \nnominee should be confirmed to high office. When there is no judicial \nexperience to look to, it is all the more critical that the Committee \ninquire fully into a nominee's experience, record, views and \nunderstanding of our fundamental rights.\n  Now, Chairman Hatch is saying precisely the same thing I am saying. \nThe difference is, he said this speaking to the Federalist Society. He \nsaid this when President Clinton was nominating the judges, not when \nPresident Bush was nominating them.\n  In 1997, he told the Utah Chapter of the Federalist Society that \n``the Senate can and should do what it can to ascertain the \njurisprudential views a nominee will bring to the bench in order to \nprevent the confirmation of those who are likely to be judicial \nactivists. Determining who will become activists is not easy since many \nof President Clinton's nominees tend to have limited paper trails . . . \n. Determining which of President Clinton's nominees will become \nactivists is complicated and it will require the Senate to be more \ndiligent and extensive in its questioning of nominees' jurisprudential \nviews.'' In the case of Mr. Estrada, however, the nominee has refused \nto provide us many answers at all about the types of jurisprudential \nviews referenced by Chairman Hatch.\n  Sauce for the goose, Mr. Chairman, sauce for the gander. You were \nright then. I take the same position today. I am right.\n  The difference is, President Clinton's nominees turned over those \npapers.\n  Most Americans want nominees who will be fair and impartial judges. \nAn independent judiciary is the people's bulwark against a loss of \ntheir freedoms and rights. I think the rights at stake are simply too \nimportant to take a chance on a lifetime appointment to this high \ncourt, to make a decision we cannot reverse, if Mr. Estrada were to \nturn out to be the activist and ideologues that many of those who have \nheard him speak candidly. What little record we have calls into \nquestion whether he would be neutral referee or an advocate and \nactivist from the bench.\n  In closing, he had a job in which he was required by law, by custom, \nby practice, to be impartial and nonideological. He wrote extensively \nin that taxpayer-funded job where he was required to be nonideological, \nimpartial, straightforward, but he will not show what he wrote.\n  We are told by the administration, trust us. We have looked at it. He \nis impartial. We say, then let us see it. Ah, you say, well, then you \nare a racist, or you have a religious bias, or whatever might be the \nreason of the day. We have heard so many misstatements from the other \nside about Mr. Estrada, let's go to the one thing that can be looked at \nobjectively: His writings.\n  It can be done. A distinguished member of the other party has \nsuggested that it be done. The White House ought to listen to him and \nthey should stop saying opposition to the nomination of Miguel Estrada \nis anti-Hispanic. We have risen in this Chamber day after day to \ndemonstrate why this is false, referring to, among other things, the \nnumbers of well-known and well-respected Latino organizations who also \noppose this nomination.\n  We have introduced into the record letters from organizations such as \nthe Mexican American Legal Defense Fund, opposed to Mr. Estrada; the \nSouthwest Voter Registration and Education Project, opposed to Mr. \nEstrada; the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund, opposed to \nMr. Estrada; a letter from 52 Latino labor leaders, opposed to Mr. \nEstrada; the Puerto Rican Bar Association of Illinois, opposed to Mr. \nEstrada. Each one of these explain their thoughtful and principled \nopposition to Mr. Estrada's nomination.\n  Today we received another letter from another Latino organization \nexpressing its opposition to the Estrada nomination. The Hispanic Bar \nAssociation of Pennsylvania has written that it, too, opposes Mr. \nEstrada's confirmation to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit. \nThe Hispanic Bar Association of Pennsylvania did not come to this \ndecision lightly.\n\n  As the letter says, they created a special committee on judicial \nnominations. They developed a process to review candidates for the \nFederal judiciary. They examined Mr. Estrada's record. They considered \na variety of factors in their evaluation. They even asked Mr. Estrada \nto come meet with them. In the end, they conclude they must oppose him. \nI respect what must have been a difficult decision, but I think letters \nfrom the Hispanic Bar Association of Pennsylvania and all these other \nLatino organizations in opposition to him show that the opposition is \nnot just because he is Hispanic.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter be made a part of the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                      Hispanic Bar\n\n\n                                  Association of Pennsylvania,\n\n                               Philadelphia, PA, January 28, 2003.\n     Re nomination of Miguel A. Estrada.\n\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Dirksen Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Honorable Sir: I am writing on behalf of the Hispanic \n     Bar Association of Pennsylvania (HBA) to inform you that we \n     oppose the appointment of Miguel Angel Estrada to the United \n     States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. \n     For the reasons that follow, we urge you to vote against Mr. \n     Estrada's confirmation.\n       The HBA recognizes that Mr. Estrada's nomination was \n     pending for some time prior to his hearing before the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee on September 26, 2002. Nevertheless, it \n     was the Hispanic National Bar Association's public \n     endorsement of this candidate that prompted our organization \n     to initiate its own evaluation of Mr. Estrada.\n       To that end, the HBA created a Special Committee on \n     Judicial Nominations to develop a process for reviewing and \n     potentially endorsing not only Mr. Estrada, but also all \n     future candidates for the Judiciary. As part of the process, \n     we contacted Mr. Estrada, asked to interview him, and invited \n     him as a guest of the HBA to meet the members of our \n     organization. Mr. Estrada, for stated good cause, declined \n     our invitations. Notwithstanding Mr. Estrada's non-\n     participation, the Committee completed its work and reported \n     its findings to the HBA membership on November 14, 2002. \n     Following the Committee's recommendation, the membership \n     voted not to support Mr. Estrada's nomination.\n       The HBA recognizes and applauds Mr. Estrada for his \n     outstanding professional and personal achievements. Indeed, \n     the HBA adopts the American Bar Association's rating of \n     ``well-qualified'' with regard to Mr. Estrada's professional \n     competence and integrity. However, employing the ABA's seven \n     established criteria for evaluating judicial temperament, the \n     HBA finds Mr. Estrada to be lacking. Our organization could \n     find no evidence that Mr. Estrada has demonstrated the \n     judicial temperament required by a nominee for such an \n     important and sensitive judicial position. In addition, the \n     HBA seeks to endorse individuals who have ``demonstrated \n     awareness and sensitivity to minority, particularly Hispanic \n     concerns.'' Sadly, we also could find no evidence of this \n     quality in Mr. Estrada.\n       The HBA shares the concern of the President of the \n     Judiciary Committee that only the best-qualified and most \n     suitable individuals be appointed to the federal bench. \n     Furthermore, the HBA appreciates the efforts, as evidenced by \n     Mr. Estrada's nomination, to consider and promote members of \n     the rapidly growing Latino population to positions of high \n     visibility and importance. However, we believe that there are \n     a myriad of other well-qualified Latinos whose integrity, \n     professional competence, and judicial temperament would be \n     beyond reproach and who would therefore be better suited for \n     this position.\n       The Hispanic Bar Association of Pennsylvania regrets that \n     it cannot support the nomination of Mr. Estrada to the United \n     States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. \n     We respectfully request that you oppose the confirmation of \n     his nomination.\n           Respectfully submitted,\n                                        Arlene Rivera Finkelstein,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I see my good friend, the distinguished chairman, on the \nfloor. I hope he has had a chance to go out and get a bite to eat, as \nwe have been doing. He certainly deserves it.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Leahy pertaining to the introduction of S. 459 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent that the distinguished Senator \nfrom\n\n[[Page S2799]]\n\nOhio speak next for 15 minutes, the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma \nspeak after that for 5 minutes, and then I be yielded the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf of the \nnomination of Miguel Estrada to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals. I had \nintended to finish my remarks this evening by reading an editorial from \nthe Washington Post. I have listened patiently to the distinguished \nSenator from Vermont, and I would like very much to quote from the Post \neditorial because it is looked upon as one of the most objective papers \nin the United States of America. Some of my colleagues think it has a \nliberal tilt to its editorial policies. This is a February 18th \neditorial from the Washington Post:\n\n       The Senate has recessed without voting on the nomination of \n     Miguel Estrada to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. \n     Circuit. Because of a Democratic Filibuster, it spent much of \n     the week debating Mr. Estrada, and, at least for now, enough \n     Democrats are holding together to prevent the full Senate \n     from acting. The arguments against Mr. Estrada's confirmation \n     range from the unpersuasive to the offensive. He lacks \n     judicial experience, his critics say--though only three \n     current members of the court had been judges before their \n     nominations. He is to young--though he is about the same age \n     as Judge Harry T. Edwards was when he was appointed and \n     several years older than Kenneth W. Starr was when he was \n     nominated. Mr. Estrada stonewalled the Judiciary Committee by \n     refusing to answer questions--though his answers were similar \n     in nature to those of previous nominees, including many \n     nominated by Democratic presidents. The administration \n     refused to turn over his Justice Department memos--though no \n     reasonable Congress ought to be seeking such material, as a \n     letter from all living former solicitors general attests. He \n     is not a real Hispanic and, by the way, he was nominated only \n     because he is Hispanic--two arguments as repugnant as they \n     are incoherent. Underlying it all is the fact that Democrats \n     don't want to put a conservative on the court.\n       Laurence H. Silberman, a senior judge on the court to which \n     Mr. Estrada aspires to serve, recently observed that under \n     the current standards being applied by the Senate, not one of \n     his colleagues could predictably secure confirmation. He's \n     right. To be sure, Republicans missed few opportunities to \n     play politics with President Clinton's nominees. But the \n     Estrada filibuster is a step beyond even those deplorable \n     games. For Democrats demand, as a condition of a vote, \n     answers to questions that no nominee should be forced to \n     address--and that nominees have not previously been forced to \n     address. If Mr. Estrada cannot get a vote, there will be no \n     reason for republicans to allow the next David S. Tatel--a \n     distinguished liberal member of the court--to get one when a \n     Democrat someday again picks judges. Yet the D.C. Circuit--\n     and all courts, for that matter--would be all the poorer were \n     it composed entirely of people whose views challenged nobody.\n       Nor is the problem just Mr. Estrada. John G. Roberts Jr., \n     Mr. Bush's other nominee to the D.C. Circuit, has been \n     waiting nearly two years for a Judiciary Committee vote. \n     Nobody has raised a substantial argument against him. Indeed, \n     Mr. Roberts is among the most highly regarded appellate \n     lawyers in the city. Yet on Thursday, Democrats invoked a \n     procedural rule to block a committee vote anyway--just for \n     good measure. It's long past time to stop these games and \n     vote.\n\n  We all know of Mr. Estrada's illustrious background. I will not \nrehash his stellar credentials. We have already heard many of our \ncolleagues come to the floor and tell what I refer to as the ``only in \nAmerica'' story about Estrada's unprecedented rise from his home in \nHonduras to his current position as a partner with one of Washington's \ndistinguished law firms.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle have leveled many \ncomplaints against Mr. Estrada, including that he has not had enough \njudicial experience. I note the following: 26 circuit judges had no \njudicial experience when they were nominated by President Clinton; they \nwere all confirmed. Of the 108 individuals who have served on the \nSupreme Court, 43 had no judicial experience at all. In fact, in the \nentire history of the Supreme Court of the United States, 8 of the 16 \nchief justices in America's history had no prior judicial experience. \nOf those justices appointed in the last 50 years, Justices William \nRehnquist, Lewis Powell, Jr., Abe Fortas, Arthur Goldberg, and Byron \nWhite had no prior judicial experience when appointed to the Supreme \nCourt.\n  On the circuit court to which Mr. Estrada has been nominated, five of \nthe eight judges had no previous judicial experience before taking the \nbench, including two Clinton nominees and one Carter nominee.\n  On the other hand, Miguel Estrada has a combined level of appellate \nand trial experience that far exceeds that of the average court of \nappeals nominee. Mr. Estrada's experience even exceeds that of many \nSupreme Court nominees. He has argued 15 cases before the U.S. Supreme \nCourt, both criminal and civil. He has tried 10 cases as a prosecutor, \nargued 7 cases before the U.S. court of appeals for the second \ndistrict, as assistant U.S. attorney for the southern district of New \nYork.\n  I emphasize to my colleagues the American Bar Association has rated \nEstrada well qualified, a rating that my colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle have called the gold standard. I heard before: Your \nnominees, Mr. President, are going to have to reach the gold standard \nof the American Bar Association. Judge Estrada has met the gold \nstandard of the American Bar Association.\n  My colleagues have also launched criticism at Mr. Estrada for not \nturning over documents--I heard that this evening several times--that \nhe worked on while he was employed by the Office of the Solicitor \nGeneral. What they do not mention is that these documents are \nconfidential. These confidential memos were not requested of the seven \nprevious nominees to the court of appeals who had worked in the \nSolicitor General's Office.\n  In addition, and I think this is very important, every living \nSolicitor General, both Democrat and Republican, signed a joint letter \nto former Judiciary Committee chairman, Senator Leahy, stating that \nfulfilling this request would have a debilitating effect on the ability \nof the Department of Justice to represent the United States before the \nSupreme Court.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. This is a very bad time to delay the appointment of \njudicial nominees. Our Federal courts are in crisis. The U.S. courts of \nappeals are currently 15 percent vacant, even as case filings in those \ncourts reached an all-time high in 2002. Chief Justice Rehnquist has \nwarned that this high vacancy level, coupled with the rising caseload, \nthreatens the proper functioning of the Federal courts.\n  Currently, there are 14 courts of appeals pending nominees, 12 of \nwhom were nominated in 2001 and have been waiting for over a year for a \nvote in the Senate. The most egregious example is the Sixth Circuit, \nwhich includes Ohio, where 6 of the 16 seats are open and classified as \njudicial emergencies. Of these six vacancies, two, Jeff Sutton and \nDeborah Cook, have been pending since May 2001, nearly 2 years, and \nthree others have been pending since November 2001, over 2 years. The \nfact is, we do have a crisis in the judiciary in the United States of \nAmerica.\n  Now, let's look at the record. When Senator Hatch was chairman during \nthe Clinton administration, he considered more than one circuit nominee \nat 11 different hearings. But not once during the 107th Congress did \nthe Democrats hold a hearing on more than one circuit court nominee at \na time. The result is we fell behind in the confirmation of circuit \nnominees.\n  Presidents Clinton, Reagan and the former President Bush all received \nconfirmations for their first 11 circuit nominees well within 1 year of \nthe nominations. This is in stark contrast with the treatment afforded \nto President George W. Bush. Only 3 of his first 11 circuit nominees \nwere confirmed within 1 year of their nomination. And only 5--fewer \nthan half--were confirmed during the entire 107th Congress. That's \nterrible.\n  My friend Senator Hatch is an extraordinary man. After so much \nrepetition of the same arguments, I'm amazed that he can even stand up.\n  As Senator Hatch has highlighted in the past, during Democrat control \nof the Senate in 2001-2002, only 17 Bush circuit court nominees reached \nthe floor for votes. In three of the cases in which they did go to the \nfloor--the nominations of Julia Smith Gibbons, Richard B. Clifton, and \nLavenski R. Smith--cloture motions were filed and the motions easily \ncarried.\n  However, and this is very important, none of those cloture votes was \nin response to a genuine effort to filibuster a nominee. Rather, \ncloture petitions were filed as a Senate time-management device.\n\n[[Page S2800]]\n\n  If the Estrada nomination is permanently blocked by a filibuster, the \npolitical baseline shifts forever.\n  To understand just how extraordinary the current situation is, one \nonly needs to examine the Senate's record of judicial confirmations. \nThe first filibuster of a judicial nominee that resulted in a cloture \nvote was in 1968. Since then, the Senate has confirmed approximately \n1,600 judicial nominations--the vast majority of these, nearly 1,500, \noccurred without even a roll call vote, as most are confirmed by \nunanimous consent.\n  Indeed, of those 1,600 judicial nominations confirmed by the Senate \nsince 1968, only 14 were subject to a cloture vote. And with the \nexception of the bipartisan 1968 filibuster of Abe Fortas' nomination \nto be Chief Justice of the United States, the Senate has never blocked \nby filibuster a judicial nominee to any court--Never.\n  The rejection of Abe Fortas to serve as Chief Justice of the United \nStates marked the first and only time the Senate has rejected a \nPresident's judicial nominee by way of a filibuster. Yet Miguel Estrada \npresents none of the concerns that caused a bipartisan coalition of \nSenators to block Justice Fortas' elevation to chief justice.\n  Given the Senate's historical unwillingness to filibuster nominees--\neven Supreme Court nominees--it is not surprising that the Senate has \nnever blocked by filibuster a nominee to any lower court. Furthermore, \nthe Senate has never blocked--by a partisan filibuster--any judicial \nnominee. As I noted, the only rejection-by-filibuster was the case of \nJustice Fortas, which was bipartisan. There is no precedent in the \nSenate of a filibuster conducted solely by one Party to deny the \nPresident his judicial nominee.\n  The stakes here are much greater than the fate of a single judicial \nnominee. At issue is whether the Senate should reinterpret its \nconstitutional advise and consent obligation to require 60 rather than \n51 votes to confirm a judicial nominee. This is a position the Senate \nhas never taken in the context of lower court nominees, and one which \nRepublicans have avoided.\n  To adopt a new standard would fundamentally alter the balance of \npower between the administration and the Senate in the judicial \nconfirmation process. It also would seriously erode the comity that has \nexisted between the two branches in the past.\n  In effect, we're playing games with the administration of justice, \nacting without regard for the problems of the Judiciary. If Senators \nfilibuster Mr. Estrada's nomination to the DC Circuit, and if that \nfilibuster results in the rejection of the nomination, Democrats will \nhave forced a permanent change to the political and constitutional \nlandscape. This in essence, would create a completely new process and \nwould, in effect, allow Senators to deny any judicial nominee their \nright to a vote.\n  Due to the numerous delays in the Estrada vote, the crisis in the \nFederal courts continues and the Senate can't attend to our pressing \nlegislative business. Our country has serious problems today and they \nrequire serious and thoughtful consideration in the Senate. The \nstalling games that are being played here are really hurting the \njudicial process and to a larger and greater extent the Nation itself.\n  While we wait for the minority to make up its mind, we cannot \naccomplish any meaningful debate on the country's pressing problems. \nThese are hard times for Americans and my constituents ask me: Do you \nguys in Washington get it? Do you get it? Do you understand what is \ngoing on?\n  We are involved in a war on terrorism abroad and at home. The economy \nis sputtering. The President of the United States has more on his plate \nthan perhaps any President in my memory. Some say he has more on his \nplate than FDR, some say Abraham Lincoln. Our constituents believe we \nare behaving like Nero, fiddling around while Rome was burning. They \ncontinue to ask, don't you get it? Is the Emperor wearing any clothes?\n  All of us in this body have priority concerns, yet during this \nstalemate, no one's legislation is moving ahead. Consideration of \nurgent matters that I would like to be addressed, such as prescription \ndrugs/Medicare reform, medical lawsuit abuse reform, asbestos \nlitigation reform, human capital, the energy bill at a time when the \ncost of natural gas is skyrocketing, or the accelerating deficit.\n  I know I am not the only Senator who is concerned about these issues \nand I know some of my colleagues have other priority concerns. At \npresent, no one is winning anything by this stalemate and the important \nconcerns of the American people are being held hostage.\n  This is bigger than a delayed vote on Miguel Estrada. As U.S. \nSenators we need to act like adults. We need to come together and \ncreate a unanimous consent agreement on how we will handle the approval \nof judges from now on. We have to find a way to reach agreement.\n  If my colleagues on the other side of the aisle persist in opposing \nMr. Estrada, they will have a hard time explaining to their \nconstituents why they voted against him since he has met, and I dare \nsay surpassed, the ``gold standard'' they asked for by the American Bar \nAssociation. They also would be hard-pressed to explain why his \nnomination has been held up for so long without a vote.\n  I've been receiving letters from my constituents who think the U.S. \nSenate is holding up this vote because Mr. Estrada is Hispanic. My \nHispanic constituents think he is being used as the whipping boy and \nthey are furious. I don't think some of my colleagues realize what this \nmeans to a minority community. In Ohio, I appointed Jose Feliciano as \nthe first Hispanic police commissioner because he was the best \ncandidate, but the Hispanic community was very proud and excited. The \nHispanic community was so proud that one of their boys made it. Can you \nthink of what an impact it had on the young people that a Hispanic made \nit to be the police commissioner.\n\n  I remember when I appointed Ken Blackwell to be the treasurer of the \nState of Ohio, the first African American to serve as the treasurer of \nthe State of Ohio, a constitutional office, and how much it meant to \nAfrican Americans in our State that someone could hold a constitutional \noffice. They had an inspiration. I came up during the years of Carl \nStokes, the first African American mayor of the city of Cleveland, and \nI remember the impact it had on young people in Cleveland and all over \nAmerica that an African American could be a mayor of a major city. I \nremember Frank Lousche, who was the mayor and Governor of the State of \nOhio, and Senator, who was a Slovenian--when I was 12 years old, how \nmuch it meant to me to see Frank Lousche, Slovenian, get to be mayor, \nand then Governor. By that time he wasn't even a Senator. But it \ninspired me and other people of my nationality to say if he can do it, \nI can do it.\n  There is more to it here. In this case I think my colleagues should \nunderstand, particularly my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, \nthis is a good man. He has the qualifications. There is not any reason \nwhy we should not allow a vote on this particularly wonderful human \nbeing who will make a difference if he has a chance to serve on the \nbench here in the DC District.\n  In addition to that, it will mean so much to Hispanics all over the \nUnited States that one of our boys made it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nOklahoma has 5 minutes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I can relate to the remarks of the Senator \nfrom Ohio. He and I had the honor of sharing the same position of mayor \nof a major city. It happens I started--maybe you did--the first \nHispanic commissioner in the city of Tulsa. We had a sister city in \nMexico, Ciudad de San Luis Potosi. They would come up there once a year \nfor this big exchange program. I can remember standing there in front \nof all of our citizens, our Hispanic citizens of Tulsa, saying: Como \nAcalde de la ciudad de Tulsa, yo quiero decir Bien venidos, bien \nvenidos a la ciudad. Creemos la Ciudad de San Luis Potosi es la ciudad \nmas hermosa de todas las ciudades del mundo.\n  Their faces shined and they realized we were participating in their \nculture and they in ours. They asked me the question last week, and I \nasked the distinguished Senator from Utah, What do we say to them when \nwe go back and talk to them? Why won't they give us a chance, give one \nHispanic a chance at a high office?\n  They asked me that question and I did not have a very good answer for\n\n[[Page S2801]]\n\nthem. But they said, You know, there are a lot of us out here who \nreally do care. They said, Why don't you kind of visit with us a little \nbit.\n  Muchos Hispanos estan eschuchando ahora. . . Y Yo Quiero Decir.\n  Por desgracia, hay personas en el senado que no quieren escuchar a ni \nuna palabra de la verdad.\n  Yo invito a la comunidad hispana para llamar a sus senadores para \ninsistir en los derechos de Miguel Estrada y en la confirmacion de \nMiguel Estrada como juez.\n  Llame los senadores, todos los senadores, especialmente los \nsenadores, de los estados de CA, FL, NY, LA, AR y NM. Llame ahora y \npreguntalos,  Es su mision. Llame \nahora! Los Estados Unidos necesitan un hispano . . . y eso hispano es \nMiguel Estrada.\n  Vaya, vaya a llamar imediamente. Los hispanos quien estan escuchando \nahora pueden hacer la diferencia.\n  Gracias Mis Amigos.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Warner). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Utah has the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have been here 27 years. I have been on \nthe Judiciary Committee 27 years. I have literally seen 1,500, 1,600 \njudges confirmed--most all of them without even a debate, just by \nunanimous consent. I have seen very few judges given a rough time and \nhardly anybody given the rough time that Miguel Estrada is being given \nhere on the floor. I have never seen anybody in the history of the \nSenate--in all of my studies of the history the Senate--filibuster a \ncircuit court of appeals nominee--never, not once. I have never seen \neven where there have been cloture votes for management purposes or \nwhatever else--certainly not a filibuster purpose--I have never seen a \ncircuit court of appeals nominee pulled down because of a filibuster--\nnever.\n  Why this double standard? Why is Miguel Estrada, with all his \ncredentials--and on the other side of the aisle they admit he has \nexceptional credentials, including their gold standard, the American \nBar Association's most well qualified standard, the highest rating \nanybody can possibly have--why is it that this double standard is being \nused against this Hispanic nominee to one of the most important courts \nin the country, this Hispanic nominee who is by all intents and \npurposes and by all measure the embodiment of the American dream?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. I would be delighted to without losing my right to the \nfloor.\n  Mr. FRIST. Is the Senator from Utah aware of any argument against the \nconfirmation of Mr. Estrada that he does not have the academic \ncredentials to suggest that he will be a fine judge?\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Of course not. They could not. Mr. Estrada graduated magna \ncum laude from Columbia University after coming from Honduras. He was 4 \nyears old when his parents divorced in Honduras. He was 17 when he came \nto this country, speaking very little English. He taught himself \nEnglish. He graduated magna cum laude from Columbia University, and \nthen he graduated magna cum laude from Harvard where he was an editor \nof the Law Review--one of the highest positions you could have in the \nlaw school. Of course not. There is no way they can say he doesn't have \nthe academic credentials to do this job.\n  Mr. FRIST. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes, without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the Senator from Utah has been reviewing \nthe records of judicial nominees for 27 years. Does the Senator know of \nmany lawyers who have argued 15 cases before the Supreme Court, as has \nMr. Estrada?\n  Mr. HATCH. Of course not. Few lawyers have. Few nominees for \njudgeships have in the history of this country. That is what makes me \nso livid--to see lesser legal minds writing partisan letters suggesting \nhe is not a qualified nominee. It drives me nuts, to be honest with \nyou. Few lawyers in America have argued 1 case before the Supreme \nCourt, let alone 15.\n  By the way, Miguel Estrada has a handicap. He has a disability. He \nhas a speech impediment. Yet he has risen to the top of the legal \nprofession in appellate advocacy and oral advocacy with a speech \nimpediment. Nobody can match that.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, will the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes, without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. FRIST. We know in fact that the American Bar Association has \ngiven Mr. Estrada its highest rating--in fact, unanimously well \nqualified. Does the Senator know if the Senate has ever obstructed a \nvote on any nominee recommended to the Senate by the Judiciary \nCommittee who has received an ABA rating of unanimously well qualified?\n  Mr. HATCH. I do not recall anyone who has had this difficulty--in \nfact, anyone with that type of a rating who has not gone through the \nSenate once reported by the Judiciary Committee, and the fact that the \nDemocrats are doing this now is outrageous.\n  Mr. FRIST. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes, without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. FRIST. Will the Senator agree that the opposition mounted against \nMr. Estrada is not about his qualifications?\n  Mr. HATCH. No. How could it be?\n  Mr. FRIST. If the Senator will yield for a question----\n  Mr. HATCH. Without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. FRIST. Is the Senator aware that it has been suggested a double \nstandard is being applied to this nominee with requests being made that \nhave never been applied to any other nominee? Does the Senator have any \nexplanation for this?\n  Mr. HATCH. I agree with the distinguished majority leader that there \nis a double standard being applied to Miguel Estrada. I don't want to \nparticularly conjecture at this point as to the motive. But a double \nstandard is generally being applied, and it is not fair.\n  Mr. FRIST. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. Without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. FRIST. The chairman of the Judiciary Committee is a \nconstitutional law scholar and knows the rules and the practices of the \nSenate. My question is, Has he ever seen a filibuster used against an \nappellate court nominee?\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Not a true filibuster. There have been cloture votes as a \nSenate management device but not a true filibuster. There has never \nbeen a true filibuster used against a circuit court of appeals nominee, \nno, and certainly not against a circuit court of appeals nominee to the \nCircuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.\n  Mr. FRIST. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes, without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. FRIST. Does the Senator from Utah share my concern that what they \nare doing in filibustering Miguel Estrada is harmful to the institution \nof the Senate and its advise and consent responsibilities?\n  Mr. HATCH. I have never been more concerned. We are in danger of \nactually breaking the system. We are in danger of doing lasting harm to \nthe Senate, its procedures, and to the President of the United States, \nand to the judiciary; to the executive branch because, if this \nfilibuster goes through, that means that on controversial nominees--and \nmy colleagues on the other side treated all of the Bush circuit court \nnominees as controversial--that means you have to have 60 votes. That \nwould apply to both sides of the floor should they get the Presidency. \nIt is a very dangerous thing and something we just definitely should \nnot allow to come to fruition.\n  Mr. FRIST. Will the Senator yield for one last question?\n  Mr. HATCH. Without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the Washington Post has repeatedly and \nemphatically called on the Democratic leadership to stop these demands \nfor confidential memoranda. I was wondering if the Senator had seen the \nWashington Post editorial from last September that said, ``Seeking Mr. \nEstrada's work product as a government lawyer is beyond any reasonable \ninquiry into what sort of judge he would be. Nor is it fair to reject \nsomeone as a judge because that person's decision to practice law \nrather than write\n\n[[Page S2802]]\n\narticles or engage in politics makes his views more opaque.''\n  Does the Senator agree that these demands go beyond any reasonable \ninquiry and are instead a gimmick and an attempt to prevent this \nnominee from ever getting a vote?\n  Mr. HATCH. Absolutely. The tactic is to demand documents that they \nknow the administration cannot give because the precedent would be so \nearthshaking because these are privileged documents, and then \nfilibustering and claiming they are filibustering because they can't \nget the documents. And when they don't get them--it is just typical of \nwhat they have been doing--they flaunt what really is proper procedure.\n\n  Then they have not only asked for documents but his record, Miguel \nEstrada's recommendations while at the Solicitor General's Office for \nappeals, certiorari matters, and amicus curiae matters.\n  Never in the history of this country has anyone given those documents \nout of the executive branch to the Senate or to anybody else. And they \nshould not, because it would deter and affect and, in many respects, \ndestroy the work of the Solicitor General, the attorney for the people \nof this country.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, will the Senator from Utah yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes, without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. DeWINE. It is my understanding there is substantial opportunity, \nfollowing hearings, to submit followup questions in writing. I wonder \nif the Senator from Utah would tell me whether that is correct or not.\n  Mr. HATCH. Absolutely. Not only did they hold one of the longest \nhearings in history for a circuit court appeals nominee--conducted by \nthem, which they said was fair, where they had the privilege of asking \nevery question they wanted or even extending the hearings if they did \nnot believe they got answers to those questions--but afterwards they \nhad a right to submit written questions.\n  And, by the way, only two people did, the distinguished Senator from \nIllinois and the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Durbin \nand Mr. Kennedy.\n  By the way, I do not believe Senator Durbin was even there during the \nhearings to ask questions. And yet I have seen, time after time, the \ndistinguished Senator from Illinois take the floor and talk about the \nnonanswers that were supposedly given.\n  I refer all of my colleagues to the speech made earlier by the \ndistinguished Senator from Tennessee Senator Alexander. He blew that \ncontention that Miguel Estrada did not answer these questions into \noblivion. I recommend everybody in this country read that speech \nbecause he actually showed the A-plus answers that Miguel Estrada gave \nto Democrat and Republican questions. And they were thorough. They were \nanswers that would make anybody proud. They were answers that any \njudicial nominee would be proud to do. And, frankly, he answered them \nbetter than almost any judicial nominees I have seen in the last 27 \nyears.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, will the Senator from Utah yield for an \nadditional question?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes, without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. DeWINE. So would the Senator from Utah agree, if a Senator \nthought that he or she did not have enough information at the hearing \nabout Mr. Estrada, or had additional questions that he or she wanted to \nhave answered, they could have submitted additional questions?\n  Mr. HATCH. No question about it. They were given the right to submit \nadditional written questions, and only two Senators did.\n  By the way, the administration has even gone further than that. They \nsaid: Look, we will present Miguel Estrada to any Democrat Senator who \nwants to ask him questions in their personal office on a personal \nbasis. They have gone to great lengths for this wonderful nominee.\n  Why is it--I ask my distinguished friend and all others who are \nlistening--that this Hispanic nominee is being given the business like \nhe is? Why is it that we have this double standard? It is one of the \nmost difficult things for me to see. It is one of the most difficult \nthings to understand.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I say to my distinguished colleague from \nUtah, I wonder if you would yield for an additional question.\n  Mr. HATCH. Without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I want to make sure I understand. I ask my colleague \nwhether or not Mr. Estrada did, in fact, answer the questions?\n  Mr. HATCH. He answered the questions. Now, he may not have answered \nthem the way some of my colleagues wanted him to. It was apparent they \nwere trying to get him ensnarled. It reminds me of the Biblical days \nwhen the pharisees would try to ensnarl Jesus Christ. They would ask \nthese questions, trying to ensnarl Him and make Him look ridiculous in \nfront of the people.\n  It was almost that bad in committee. He answered every question. \nUnfortunately, for them, he answered them precisely the way most \nDemocrat nominees did; and that is, instead of going into how he would \nrule on matters that would come before him later in the court, he \nbasically said: I will obey the law. I will sustain the law. I will \nfollow the law regardless of my own personal views.\n  That is what the Democrat nominees have said. And that is a correct \nanswer. And it is a very good answer. His answers were more literate, \nmore scholarly, more persuasive, in many of the questions that were \nasked than I have seen in most nominees.\n  Again, I ask, why the double standard in this case? Why don't we \nrecognize how great this young man is and allow him the same privileges \nthat we have given to countless Democrats during the Clinton years when \nwe confirmed 377 Clinton nominees to the Federal court--the second all-\ntime highest confirmation rate in history, only 5 below the highest, \nand that was Ronald Reagan, who had 382?\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, will my distinguished colleague from Utah \nyield for an additional question?\n  Mr. HATCH. Without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. DeWINE. It is my understanding that the ABA conducted its own \nvery thorough investigation of Mr. Estrada before they decided to give \nhim their highest possible rating, well qualified.\n  Could the Senator from Utah tell me whether or not that is correct?\n  Mr. HATCH. That is correct.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I wonder if my colleague will yield for an \nadditional question.\n  Mr. HATCH. Without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Now, the ABA has expressly stated it does not evaluate a \nnominee's ideology because it ``restricts its evaluation to issues \nbearing on professional qualifications.'' But the ABA does investigate \na nominee's openmindedness and freedom from bias.\n  Could the Senator from Utah tell me whether it seems unreasonable to \nbelieve that the ABA would have unanimously given Mr. Estrada its \nhighest rating if it thought he would use his judicial role to advance \nhis personal ideology?\n  Mr. HATCH. There is no way they would have, no way in this world. In \nfact, there are plenty of Democrats, and I might add, partisan \nDemocrats, who do not act in a partisan way--and neither do the \nRepublicans--on that standing committee. In fact, if I recall it \ncorrectly, there are more Democrats on the committee than Republicans. \nAnd they all unanimously gave Miguel Estrada the highest rating that \nthe American Bar Association can possibly give.\n\n  Keep in mind, my colleagues on the other side of the floor said that \nthe American Bar Association rating is the gold standard, it is the \nthing that makes the difference as to why they will vote for people. \nAnd ``qualified'' is normally enough to vote for anybody. Here is a man \nwho has been rated unanimously ``well qualified'' by both Democrats and \nRepublicans on the standing committee, who I think are doing a good job \non that committee.\n  I have been critical of the committee in the past, but I think during \nthe last few years of the Clinton administration, and up to today, that \nthey have been doing a good job.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I wonder if my distinguished colleague \nwill yield for an additional question.\n  Mr. HATCH. Without losing my right to the floor.\n\n[[Page S2803]]\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Can the Senator from Utah tell me whether I am correct in \nunderstanding that, despite the assurances of those who have worked \nwith Mr. Estrada, and the unanimous affirmation of the ABA, some of our \ncolleagues continue to be unconvinced that Mr. Estrada would be an \nunbiased interpreter of the law?\n  Mr. HATCH. I do not see how any colleague could remain unconvinced of \nthat. He will be. He will follow the law. He has said he will follow \nthe law. He said he would uphold precedent. He said he would do what is \nright regardless of his own personal beliefs.\n  That is all you can ask of any of these nominees. And he has answered \nthose questions absolutely accurately, the way the Clinton nominees \nanswered those questions.\n  Why--again, might I ask--is there a double standard with regard to \nthis Hispanic nominee? Why is there? I cannot see any reason for it.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I wonder if my colleague will yield for \none additional question.\n  Mr. HATCH. Without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I have really tried to understand where some of our \ncolleagues are coming from with their adamant opposition to this \nextraordinarily well-qualified nominee. The most common criticism has \nbeen that there is some concern about whether they know what his \npersonal views are.\n  I wonder if the Senator from Utah could address that and perhaps \nremind us again of what Mr. Estrada's supervisors at the U.S. Solicitor \nGeneral's Office have said about Mr. Estrada's ability to separate his \npersonal views from his analysis of the law.\n  Mr. HATCH. Well, he worked for both the Clinton administration and a \nRepublican administration. And he got the highest raves and performance \nevaluations by both administrations, meaning that he worked in a \nbipartisan way with both administrations. Unfortunately, in order to \ncreate a red herring issue that they can hide behind, our colleagues on \nthe other side have demanded his recommendations while at the Solicitor \nGeneral's Office--the attorney for the U.S.A., for us citizens, the \nprivate, privileged memoranda, his recommendations on appeals on \nmatters involving certiorari and on matters involving amicus curiae. \nThere has never been such a move. To my knowledge, the Justice \nDepartment, the Solicitor General's Office has never--nor will it \never--give up those documents because they are privileged executive \nbranch documents.\n\n  I cannot help but believe our colleagues on the other side know as \nmuch about that as I do. They know that is absolutely accurate, and I \nam just suggesting this is a red herring issue so that they can hold up \nthis nominee with a filibuster, of all things--the first in history.\n  Let me just go further on that because it is a very important issue, \nthe only issue they seem to have. I hate to say it, but some of our \nfriends in the media ignore the fact that the seven living former \nSolicitors General wrote a letter to Chairman Leahy that says this:\n\n       We write to express our concerns about your present request \n     that the Department of Justice turn over appeal \n     recommendations, certiorari recommendations, and amicus \n     recommendations that Miguel Estrada worked on while in the \n     Office of the Solicitor General.\n       As former heads of the Office of--\n\n  By the way, of these seven former Solicitors General--the only living \nones--four of them, or better than 50 percent, are Democrats. Three he \nworked for. They said:\n\n       As former heads of the Office of the Solicitor General \n     under Presidents of both parties, we can attest to the vital \n     importance of candor and confidentiality of the Solicitor's \n     decisionmaking process.\n\n  I will read a couple other thoughts here:\n\n       It goes without saying that when we made these and other \n     critical decisions, we relied on frank, honest, and thorough \n     advice from our staff attorneys, like Mr. Estrada. Our \n     decisionmaking process required the unbridled, open exchange \n     of ideas, an exchange that simply cannot take place if \n     attorneys have reason to fear that their private \n     recommendations are not private at all, but vulnerable to \n     public disclosure. Attorneys inevitably will hesitate before \n     giving their honest, independent analysis if their opinions \n     are not safeguarded from future disclosure.\n       High-level decisionmaking requires candor, and candor, in \n     turn, requires confidentiality.\n\n  Remember, four of these seven are Democrats. The other three are \nRepublicans. All of them are together in this, though.\n\n       Any attempt to intrude into the office's highly privileged \n     deliberations would come at the cost of the Solicitor \n     General's ability to defend vigorously the United States \n     litigation interest, a cost that also would be borne by \n     Congress itself. Although we proudly respect the Senate's \n     duty to evaluate Mr. Estrada's fitness for the Federal \n     judiciary, we do not think that the confidentiality and \n     integrity of internal deliberations should be sacrificed in \n     the process.\n\n  This is signed by Seth B. Waxman, on behalf of himself, Walter \nDellinger, Drew Days--three Democrats--Kenneth Starr, Charles Fried, \nand Robert H. Bork, all Republicans, and Archibald Cox, of course, a \nDemocrat--four Democrats and three Republicans. That speaks for itself. \nI hope it puts to bed this phony red herring argument that has been \nlodged by the other side. It is phony, wrong, and should not be given \nthe time of day. I call on the media to start being responsible with \nregard to these matters.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, will the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. I will, without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the Chicago Tribune has strongly condemned \nthe filibuster the chairman is speaking to tonight. So has the Chicago \nSun-Times. Those papers don't agree on a lot of things, but one thing \nthey are now agreeing on is that a filibuster is a bad idea. The \nTribune said, regarding this confidential memo request that you have \njust referred to:\n\n       Anyone who wants a glimpse into Estrada's thinking can \n     scrutinize the briefs he wrote and the oral arguments he \n     made.\n\n  The Sun-Times wrote:\n\n       Our legal system cannot and must not be held hostage to \n     political nitpicking.\n\n  It agrees with President Bush that this would be a shameful event.\n  Now, I know the Senator from Illinois is not in the Chamber now, but \nas you referenced him a moment ago, he has been in the Chamber quite \noften demanding these briefs be turned over. You are the chairman of \nthe committee. At the time you were the ranking member and were there--\nI was not, as I am a new member of the Judiciary Committee. I was not \nthere during the core investigation and questioning of Miguel Estrada. \nCan you tell me if the Senator from Illinois was there and if he asked \nany questions at the time? He seems not to know about this man.\n  Mr. HATCH. My recollection is that he was not at the hearing and he \ndidn't ask any questions. He and every Democrat had a right to do it, \nand it went all day long. Yet the Senator seems to be trying to give \nthe impression that he knows everything that went on at the hearings. \nTrue, he could have read the transcript, but he had every chance to ask \nquestions. Why wasn't he there? Why didn't he ask the questions? Why is \nhe in the Chamber criticizing Miguel Estrada and criticizing the \nprocess and using this phony excuse with regard to the confidential, \nprivileged memoranda of the Justice Department along with his \ncolleagues?\n  I don't blame any one person. They are all to blame for using these \nkinds of phony arguments. I think the media is to blame--some of them. \nI have 57 different editorials, 50 of which are for Mr. Estrada.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. Not just yet. You mentioned the Chicago Sun-Times. My \nstaff just gave me that. You know, it is interesting--I will quote a \ncouple lines.\n\n       Who can look at the spectacle of the 108th Congress and not \n     believe that justice and the basic operation of the Nation is \n     being sacrificed on the altar of ugly obstructionist, \n     partisan politics?\n\n  That is the Chicago Sun-Times, which is not known as a conservative \nnewspaper, to my knowledge.\n  Let me give one other. I am quoting a couple sentences. I will put \nthe whole editorial into the Record, if I can. I ask unanimous consent \nthat this be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S2804]]\n\n              [From the Chicago Sun-Times, Feb. 14, 2003]\n\n         Wheels of Justice Caught in Washington Gridlock, Again\n\n       ``The time has come for the U.S. Senate to stop playing \n     politics with the American judicial system. So bad has the \n     situation become that some Americans wonder whether justice \n     is being hindered. . . '' So began an editorial on this page \n     five years ago, during the now-distant days of the Clinton \n     administration, when Senate Republicans were stonewalling \n     judicial nominees from a Democratic president.\n       We mention it because the party in power tends to scream \n     about efficient government, while the party out of power \n     complains about failure to follow procedure. To quote \n     Shakespeare, ``A plague on both their houses.'' The only \n     update we'd make in the opening quote is to change ``some \n     Americans'' into ``many Americans'' or even ``most \n     Americans.'' For who can look at the spectacle of the 108th \n     Congress and not believe that both justice and the basic \n     operation of the nation is being sacrificed on the altar of \n     ugly, obstructionist, partisan politics?\n       After dragging their feet on shifting committee \n     chairmanships and the routine operations of the nation's \n     business, Senate Democrats, though in a minority, are \n     threatening to filibuster over the confirmation of Miguel \n     Estrada, a Washington lawyer who seems eminently qualified \n     for the federal appeals bench in every way except for his \n     alacrity to answer questions about his opinions on legal \n     matters that have not yet been presented to him, such as the \n     issue of abortion.\n       The entire idea behind disabling the business of the nation \n     is so that the blame for whatever bad situation we find \n     ourselves in come election 2004 can be laid at the feet of \n     the Republicans, since they are in power. But the Democrats \n     forget that, if they manager to torpedo the Republican \n     agenda, then the republicans are not really fully in power, \n     and whatever problems are certain to come are the fault of \n     both parties. And obstructionism hurt Democrats in last \n     November's voting.\n       President Bush called the Democratic approach ``shameful \n     politics.'' We are not revealing a bias when we agree--the \n     nation needs good judges, from both parties, of both \n     conservative and liberal outlooks. Our legal system cannot \n     and must not be held hostage to political nitpicking. Estrada \n     deserves to be the first Hispanic on the U.S. Court of \n     Appeals for the District of Columbia,and if his nomination in \n     some way helps to break the political deadlock keeping \n     critical judgeships from being filled, that will be just \n     another accomplishment to add to his record.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. ``Our legal system could not and cannot be held hostage to \nthe political nitpicking''--which is exactly what is going on here. I \nadmit that my distinguished colleague from Illinois did take the time \nto submit questions. None of the others did, except Senator Kennedy. \nAll of them are complaining that he didn't answer the questions. I will \nsay that my friend and colleague from Illinois did take the time to \nsubmit written questions. He deserves credit for that. But as far as I \nknow, I don't believe he asked any questions at the hearing.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, will the Senator yield further for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes, without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I know the Senator is now in the Chamber. I have \nreferenced these two articles. Those papers have condemned the \nfilibuster, and they have condemned the strategy being used here to try \nto pry well beyond the oral arguments and briefs of Mr. Estrada.\n  I want to also ask, was the Senator also aware that the Freeport \nJournal-Standard, the oldest news source in northwest Illinois, has \neditorialized that this demand for Solicitor General memos would do \nserious damage to the ability of any member of the Justice Department \nto participate in its deliberative process, and that the same paper \nconcluded Democrats are free to vote against him if they want, but vote \nthey must; to do otherwise is an outrageous abuse of power.\n  The question then: Was the Senator aware that this story had reached \nour heartland and that now newspapers all over America are reacting? \nAnd was he aware that they are speaking to this kind of injustice?\n  Mr. HATCH. I am. Many editorials are complaining and pointing out \nthat this is terrible politics. It is a terrible thing to do. It is a \ndouble standard. You quoted the Freeport Journal-Standard. Let me quote \none paragraph:\n\n       If there is one example today of the worst in American \n     politics, it is the decision by Senate Democrats to \n     filibuster the nomination of Miguel Estrada to the U.S. Court \n     of Appeals for the District of Columbia. President Bush's \n     description of the move as ``shameful politics'' is generous. \n     It is a downright repugnant abuse of the Constitution.\n\n  The rest of the editorial is good as well. I ask unanimous consent \nthat it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          [From the Freeport Journal Standard, Feb. 20, 2003]\n\n               Senate Dems Showing Worst Side of Politics\n\n       The issue: Judicial nominations.\n       Our view: For Senate Democrats to filibuster the nomination \n     of Miguel Estrada is an outrageous abuse of power.\n       If there is one example today of the worst in American \n     politics, it is the decision by Senate Democrats to \n     filibuster the nomination of Miguel Estrada to the U.S. Court \n     of Appeals for the District of Columbia. President Bush's \n     description of the move as ``shameful politics'' is generous. \n     It is a downright repugnant abuse of the Constitution.\n       The chief reasons Democrats give is Estrada, an American \n     success story who went from Honduran immigrant to graduating \n     Harvard magna cum laude to Supreme Court clerk and beyond, is \n     a ``stealth conservative,'' whatever that means. They say his \n     responses to questions at committee hearings on his \n     nomination did not sufficiently reveal his political opinions \n     and demand that confidential memoranda written by Estrada \n     when he was an assistant solicitor general be turned over. \n     This is unprecedented, and if allowed, would do serious \n     damage to the ability of any member of the Justice Department \n     to participate in its deliberative processes.\n       Clearly, Democrats are fearful of conservative jurists. But \n     for eight years, Bill Clinton nominated liberal jurists to \n     the bench, including three Supreme Court justices. This is \n     called democracy. The proper recourse is not to bottle up \n     every nomination on the basis of some asinine political \n     litmus test, but to win the presidency. If this continues, we \n     can expect Republicans to use the same tactic and the result \n     will strangle our justice system.\n       The Senate has a Constitutional duty to vote on the \n     president's judicial nominees. By all accounts, Estrada is a \n     brilliant scholar, distinguished public servant and \n     outstanding lawyer, rated by the American Bar Association as \n     ``highly qualified.''\n       Democrats are free to vote against him if they want, but \n     vote they must. To do otherwise is an outrageous abuse of \n     power.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for yielding for \nquestions.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. I will be happy to yield for a question without losing my \nright to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to ask the Senator--I was off the floor in \nthe cloakroom--it is my understanding my name was raised during the \ncourse of the debate.\n  Mr. HATCH. It was raised in a question to me.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator. I ask the Senator, is he aware of \nthe fact that I was present for the questioning of Miguel Estrada? I \ncame to the hearing room on several occasions and, unfortunately, \nbecause of the timing of the schedule, I was never called for questions \nand forced to go to other committee hearings and submitted written \nquestions to Miguel Estrada?\n  Mr. HATCH. I will take the Senator's word on that. There is no \nquestion the distinguished Senator did submit written questions which \nwere answered, but I also answer the Senator that this hearing went on \nall day. It was an extraordinarily long hearing, and if the Senator had \nany questions that he wanted to ask, I think it was his duty and his \nobligation to get there and ask them, by the way, because we can all \nfind time during the complete day's hearing to come to the committee.\n  I am not trying to find fault. What I am saying is that it is one \nthing to be able to speak from personal experience of having been there \nand asked questions; it is another thing to continually come to the \nfloor and berate Mr. Estrada for not answering questions when, if you \nrefer to the remarks of the distinguished junior Senator from Tennessee \nearlier this evening, that just is not true. The fact is, he answered \nthe questions.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. HATCH. I will say this--and I compliment my dear colleague from \nIllinois--my colleague from Illinois did submit written questions, but \nthere were answers to those written questions as well. I have to say, \nmy colleague from Illinois was 1 of 2 out of 9 Democrats--actually 10 \nat the time--who submitted questions. All of a sudden to come here with \ncrocodile tears----\n\n[[Page S2805]]\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me finish my remarks and, of course, I will. But to \ncome here with crocodile tears and tell us that he just did not do \nenough and he did not answer the questions when he did, in fact, do so, \nand to misrepresent, as some have done--I am not saying the \ndistinguished Senator from Illinois because I have not heard all of his \nremarks; people will have to judge that for themselves. But to come \nhere and make those kinds of accusations when this man had one of the \nlongest hearings, answered many more questions than almost any Clinton \ncircuit court of appeals nominee had to answer when I was chairman, and \nto act like he does not deserve to have an up-or-down vote on the \nSenate floor, which we gave to every Clinton nominee, I think is a \nlittle bit beyond the pale, and I think that is what has been happening \naround here.\n  Personally, I resent it, on behalf of the United States of America \nand on behalf of this Hispanic nominee who has all of these \nqualifications which I believe even the Senator from Illinois has \nacknowledged.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. Without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. During the course of the hearing on Miguel Estrada, we \nusually have rounds where Senators ask questions. Does the Senator from \nUtah recall the length of the rounds of the questions that each Senator \ncould ask of Miguel Estrada?\n  Mr. HATCH. I recall that they were lengthy, and I recall that Senator \nSchumer from New York chaired the hearing. I did not chair the hearing. \nHe could have set up any kind of rounds he wanted to, and, as I \nunderstand it, everybody had a full opportunity to ask the questions \nthey wanted, both Democrats and Republicans.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will allow me to ask a question----\n  Mr. HATCH. If I can just continue, the Senator himself said Mr. \nEstrada has not answered any questions, and the Senator from Illinois \nat least implied that from time to time.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Since my name has been brought up in debate--it becomes a \ndebate over the Senator from Illinois rather than Estrada--I hope the \nSenator from Utah will give me a chance to respond.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has the floor and the \nChair requests that the Senator from Illinois address his questions to \nthe Chair.\n  Mr. HATCH. I am not accusing my colleague from Illinois of anything \nother than based upon whatever he said on the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator allow me to ask a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. What I do want to make clear is I believe the \ndistinguished Senator from Illinois and others have been saying that \nMr. Estrada did not answer the questions. Let me recall, in case it \nmight have slipped the mind of the distinguished Senator, ``Follow-up \nQuestions for Miguel Estrada, Senator Richard J. Durbin, Senate \nJudiciary Committee.'' Let me read a few of these.\n  One:\n\n       During your nominations hearing, Senator Edwards asked \n     whether you consider yourself a ``strict constructionist'' \n     when it comes to interpreting the Constitution. You described \n     yourself instead as a ``fair constructionist.'' How do you \n     distinguish these two concepts? In what ways are they \n     similar? In what ways are they different?\n\n  That is an intelligent question. I commend my colleague.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. HATCH. The response:\n\n       I do not believe that a legal text, such as the \n     Constitution, should be construed ``strictly'' (i.e., \n     grudgingly) or ``loosely'' (i.e., without careful regard to \n     the text's language so as to achieve a meaning beyond that \n     which the text will fairly bear). In my view, the \n     Constitution, like other legal texts, should be construed \n     reasonably and fairly, to give effect to all that its text \n     contains. Although the phrase ``strict construction'' is \n     often used to reflect a legal philosophy that simply gives \n     appropriate consideration to the text of the Constitution, \n     the phrase is also sometimes used in a pejorative fashion to \n     describe an approach to interpretation that does not fairly \n     reflect the meaning that the words, history, and background \n     of the text will fairly bear. For that reason, I avoided \n     using that phrase in response to Senator Edwards' question.\n\n  The distinguished Senator from Illinois asked if the current members \nof the Supreme Court--this is written because he did not ask oral \nquestions during the hearing:\n\n       Of the current members of the Supreme Court, who would you \n     characterize as a strict constructionist? Who would you \n     characterize as a fair constructionist? How would you \n     characterize the remaining Justices?\n\n  Response:\n\n       Although the current members of the United States Supreme \n     Court sometimes emphasize different interpretive tools--\n     giving, for example, greater or less prominence to text, \n     history or precedent in a particular case--I believe each of \n     them attempts in good faith to give a fair reading to the \n     constitutional provisions that come before the Court. For \n     that reason, I would characterize each member of the current \n     Court as a ``fair constructionist.''\n\n  The question again from the distinguished Senator from Illinois:\n\n       In terms of judicial philosophy, please name several \n     judges, living or dead, whom you admire and would like to \n     emulate on the bench.\n\n  This is what Mr. Estrada responded:\n\n       There is no judge, living or dead, whom I would seek to \n     emulate on the bench, whether in terms of judicial philosophy \n     or otherwise. If I am fortunate enough to be confirmed, I \n     hope to seek aid from whatever legal materials may shed light \n     on the problem before me, and thus to reach the correct \n     answer to that problem to the best of my abilities, without \n     any preconception about how some other judge might approach \n     the question.\n       I have been fortunate to know several great judges and \n     justices in my lifetime. I admire Judge Amalya Kearse and \n     Justice Anthony Kennedy, for whom I was a law clerk. During \n     my time as a law clerk for Justice Kennedy, I also got to \n     work with retired Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr., for whom I \n     developed a great deal of affection and admiration.\n\n  Amalya Kearse was a Carter appointee to the Second Circuit Court of \nAppeals. In other words, this man has admired a Democratic judge. \nAnthony Kennedy is, of course, considered a moderate conservative on \nthe Supreme Court. He served him as a clerk, and admires him. Then he \nadmires Lewis F. Powell, Jr., who is considered one of the leading \nmoderate judges during his lifetime on the Court.\n  I could read all of these questions and answers, and I think any fair \nperson would say he gave some very good answers that would pass almost \nany professorial, jurisprudential, legal, or other analysts' reviews.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the followup questions for Miguel \nEstrada by Senator Richard J. Durbin and his answers be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nFollow-up Questions for Miguel Estrada From Senator Richard J. Durbin, \n                       Senate Judiciary Committee\n\n       (1) During your nominations hearing, Senator Edwards asked \n     whether you consider yourself a ``strict constructionist'' \n     when it comes to interpreting the Constitution. You described \n     yourself instead as a ``fair constructionist.''\n       (a) How do you distinguish these two concepts? In what ways \n     are they similar? In what ways are they different?\n       Response: I do not believe that a legal text, such as the \n     Constitution, should be construed ``strictly'' (i.e., \n     grudgingly) or ``loosely'' (i.e., without careful regard to \n     the text's language so as to achieve a meaning beyond that \n     which the text will fairly bear). In my view, the \n     Constitution, like other legal texts, should be construed \n     reasonably and fairly, to give effect to all that its text \n     contains. Although the phrase ``strict construction'' is \n     often used to reflect a legal philosophy that simply gives \n     appropriate consideration to the text of the Constitution, \n     the phrase is also sometimes used in a pejorative fashion to \n     describe an approach to interpretation that does not fairly \n     reflect the meaning that the words, history and background of \n     the text will fairly bear. For that reason, I avoided using \n     that phrase in response to Senator Edwards' question.\n       (b) Of the current members of the Supreme Court, who would \n     you characterize as a strict constructionist? Who would you \n     characterize as a fair constructionist? How would you \n     characterize the remaining justices?\n       Response: Although the current members of the United States \n     Supreme Court sometimes emphasize different interpretive \n     tools--giving, from example, greater or less prominence to \n     text, history or precedent in a particular case--I believe \n     each of them attempts in good faith to give a fair reading to \n     the Constitutional provisions that come before the Court. For \n     that reason, I would characterize each member of the current \n     Court as a ``fair constructionist.''\n       (c) In terms of judicial philosophy, please name several \n     judges, living or dead, whom you admire and would like to \n     emulate on the bench.\n       Response: There is no judge, living or dead, whom I would \n     seek to emulate on the bench,\n\n[[Page S2806]]\n\n     whether in terms of judicial philosophy or otherwise. If I am \n     fortunate enough to be confirmed, I hope to seek aid from \n     whatever legal materials may shed light on the problem before \n     me, and thus to reach the correct answer to that problem to \n     the best of my abilities, without any preconception about how \n     some other judge might approach the question.\n       I have been fortunate to know several great judges and \n     justices in my lifetime. I admire Judge Amalya Kearse and \n     Justice Anthony Kennedy, for whom I was a law clerk. During \n     my time as a law clerk for Justice Kennedy, I also got to \n     work with retired Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr., for whom I \n     developed a great deal of affection and admiration.\n       (2) In an attempt to learn more about your judicial \n     philosophy, several of my colleagues asked for your opinion \n     about constitutional questions that are now settled law and \n     that are unlikely to come before you as an appellate court \n     judge. For example, Chairman Leahy asked for your views on \n     Romer v. Evans, a Supreme Court opinion striking down a state \n     constitutional provision that prohibited municipalities from \n     passing gay rights ordinances. You responded: ``the question \n     as framed is inherently unknowable for somebody in my \n     position who has not sat through the case, listened to the \n     arguments, conferred with the colleagues, and done all of the \n     legwork of investigating every last clue that the briefs and \n     the arguments offer up.''\n       Likewise, in response to questioning from Senator Schumer, \n     you stated: ``The only time that I will feel comfortable in \n     opining whether the Court got it right would be if I had done \n     everything that the Court had to do in order to actually \n     issue their ruling.''\n       (a) In your role as an Assistant to the Solicitor General, \n     I am sure you read many of the Supreme Court's decisions. \n     Have you ever expressed any opinion on the merits of a \n     Supreme Court decision, to your colleagues or friends, when \n     you had not read the briefs and watched the oral argument in \n     the case? For example, have you ever told anyone that you \n     thought the Romer v. Evans was rightly or wrongly decided?\n       Response. During my tenure at the Solicitor General's \n     office, it was not uncommon for lawyers in the office to \n     discuss issues then pending, or recently decided, by the \n     Supreme Court. Such discussions were generally informal \n     (often at the lunch table, since it was the practice of the \n     attorneys in the office to lunch together in the Department's \n     cafeteria) and did not purport to reflect a considered \n     judgment that a particular decision was objectively ``right'' \n     or ``wrong'' based on an appraisal of all briefing, argument, \n     and primary materials--the type of judgment that a sitting \n     judge would have to make in deciding the case. It was \n     probably the case that neither my Justice Department \n     colleagues nor I had read every brief filed in a particular \n     case or attended argument. Generally, my colleagues and I \n     would speak of a particular decision in terms of whether it \n     served the Government's programmatic interests and/or whether \n     the majority opinion set forth better reasons for the outcome \n     than did the dissenting opinion (i.e., whether one of the \n     opinions was a better piece of legal reasoning and writing). \n     I do not have any recollection that I or any of my colleagues \n     ever described any particular decision (including Romer) as \n     ``wrong,'' but it is possible that remarks such as that were \n     made in informal conversations--as shorthand for whether a \n     decision accorded with the Government's interest in an area \n     or whether the outcome urged by a dissenting opinion was \n     advocated better than the result reached by the Court's \n     majority.\n       (b) You and I met privately before your hearing, and I \n     asked you for your views on Roe v. Wade. You indicated that \n     you considered the answer to that question to be private \n     matter. But your answer suggested that you do have an \n     opinion. Do you have an opinion on the merits of Roe v. Wade? \n     If so, have you read the briefs and a transcript of the oral \n     argument?\n       Response: I stated during our meeting that, like many \n     Americans, I have personal views on the subject of abortion, \n     which views I consider a private matter that I was unprepared \n     to share or discuss with you. I also stated that I do not \n     harbor any personal views of any kind that, if I were a \n     judge, would preclude me from applying controlling Supreme \n     Court case law in the area of abortion. I did not state that \n     I have private views on whether the case of Roe v. Wade was \n     correctly decided. As I stated during my hearing, it would \n     not be appropriate for me to express such a view without \n     doing the intensive work that a judge hearing that case would \n     have to under take--not only reading briefs, and hearing the \n     arguments of counsel, but also independently investigating \n     the relevant constitutional text, case law, and history.\n       (3) You serve on the National Board of Directors for a non-\n     profit foundation called the Center for the Community \n     Interest, or CCI. According to CCI's website, the group's \n     goal is ``to make communities and neighborhoods safe places \n     to live and raised children and to make the public spaces of \n     our cities secure and inviting places for all by helping to \n     identify common sense, balanced solution to crime and \n     quality-of-life problems and to defend those policies against \n     unreasonable legal attacks.''\n       (a) How did you become associated with CCI? For how long \n     have you served on the Board of Directors?\n       Response: In the Fall of 1998, Eliot Spitzer was elected \n     Attorney General of New York. Mr. Spitzer was a Board member \n     of CCI (and, through his family foundation, was and is an \n     important financial supporter of CCI). As a result of his \n     election, Mr. Spitzer had to resign his Board position. I was \n     invited to join the board, and fill the ensuing vacancy, by \n     another Board member, Scott Muller has long been involved in \n     CCI, and I knew him as a highly respected attorney who \n     practices in Washington, D.C.and New York City; he was \n     recently confirmed by the Senate as General Counsel of the \n     CIA. I have served on the Board since my election in late \n     1998/early 1999.\n       (b) As a director, what role do you plan in the management \n     of the organization? How frequently does the Board meet?\n       Response: CCI has a full-time staff that deals with day-to-\n     day matters. The Board deals with major policy issues and the \n     general direction and management of the organization.\n       It has been a goal of the current Board to increase the \n     number of times we meet. When I first joined the Board, we \n     met only twice a year. We now try to meet three or four times \n     a year. Meetings of the Board may be conducted if a quorum of \n     a majority of the directors is present. Although I try to \n     attend every meeting personally or by telephone, I have not \n     participated in every meeting of the Board that has been held \n     since I joined the Board.\n       (4) Although the organization purports to defend ``common \n     sense'' government policies ``against unreasonable legal \n     attacks,'' CCI has adopted some very controversial positions \n     over the last few years. For example, in Dickerson v. United \n     States, CCI filed an amicus brief urging the Supreme Court to \n     overturn the landmark Miranda decision, which ensures that \n     criminal suspects have adequate notice of their legal rights.\n       As you know, the position favored by CCI in Dickerson was \n     rejected by a decisive seven member majority of the Supreme \n     Court, in a decision authored by Chief Justice Rehnquist. The \n     only dissenters in the case were Justices Antonin Scalia and \n     Clarence Thomas.\n       (a) As a Director of CCI, did you participate in \n     deliberations or play any other role in the group's decision \n     to file an amicus brief in Dickerson?\n       Response: Yes. I was one of the Board members who voted on \n     the question whether CCI should file a brief in the case.\n       (b) Do you support the group's position in that case? Why \n     or why not?\n       Response: I voted in favor of filing an amicus brief in the \n     case. As I saw it, the case primarily involved an important \n     unsettled legal issue that hinged on the constitutionality of \n     an Act of Congress, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3501, rather than the \n     issue whether Miranda should be superseded because of any \n     disagreement that the current Supreme Court might have with \n     that decision.\n       As is widely known, the Supreme Court in Miranda required \n     that certain warnings be given to suspects during custodial \n     interrogations. It is less widely known that, in announcing \n     that ruling, the Supreme Court also stated (384 U.S. at 467): \n     ``It is impossible for us to foresee the potential \n     alternatives for protecting the privilege which might be \n     devised by Congress or the States in the exercise of their \n     creative rule-making capacities. Therefore we cannot say that \n     the Constitution necessarily requires adherence to any \n     particular solution for the inherent compulsions of the \n     interrogation process as it is presently conducted. Our \n     decision in no way creates a constitutional straitjacket \n     which will handicap sound efforts at reform, nor is it \n     intended to have this effect. We encourage Congress and the \n     States to continue their laudable search for increasingly \n     effective ways of protecting the rights of the individual \n     while promoting efficient enforcement of our criminal \n     laws.''\n       In 1968, in the wake of that decision and in reliance on \n     the Court's suggestion, Congress enacted 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3501. \n     That statute required federal courts to admit into evidence \n     all voluntary confessions, after assessing the issue of \n     voluntariness in light of all the facts and circumstances \n     surrounding the confession--including whether the suspect \n     received the warnings required by the Miranda case.\n       Although some lower courts had assumed that Section 3501 \n     was not constitutional, as a CCI Board member I supported the \n     filing of an amicus brief that supported the \n     constitutionality of the statute. I believed that a law duly \n     passed by both Houses of Congress and signed by the President \n     should not be ignored by the lower courts without an \n     authoritative resolution of the constitutional question by \n     the Supreme Court of the United States.\n       (c) Do you think that the defendant's challenge of the \n     Fourth Circuit's decision in Dickerson was an unreasonable \n     legal attack?\n       Response: No.\n       (d) Chief Justice Rehnquist's decision in Dickerson invoked \n     the doctrine of stare decisis. Do you agree with the \n     application of that doctrine in this case? When is it \n     appropriate for the Supreme Court to overturn its own \n     precedents?\n       Response: Dickerson reflects a reasonable application of \n     the doctrine of stare decisis. In my view, it is rarely \n     appropriate for the Supreme Court to overturn one of its own \n     precedents. The circumstances that bear on the \n     appropriateness of such a course were summarized by the Court \n     in Agostini v. Felton, 521 U.S. 203, 235-37 (1997), and by \n     the plurality opinion in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern \n     Pa. v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, 854-55 (1992).\n       (5) Dickerson was an alarming case to many of us because \n     the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, on its own initiative, \n     determined\n\n[[Page S2807]]\n\n     that Miranda was no longer binding law. They reached this \n     conclusion even though the Supreme Court continued to apply \n     Miranda to criminal cases in both the federal and state \n     systems; and despite the fact that neither the government nor \n     the criminal defendant was willing to argue that Miranda did \n     not apply. The Fourth Circuit's ruling in Dickerson strikes \n     me as a prime example of the conservative judicial activism \n     we sometimes see today.\n       (a) What assurances can you give the Committee that you \n     will follow Supreme Court precedent unless and until the \n     Court explicitly overrules itself?\n       Response: I can absolutely assure the Committee that I will \n     follow binding Supreme Court precedent until and unless such \n     precedent has been displaced by subsequent decisions of the \n     Supreme Court itself.\n       (b) If confirmed to the D.C. Circuit, can you assure us \n     that you will faithfully apply the Supreme Court's ruling in \n     Miranda? What about the Supreme Court's decision in Bakke, \n     which upheld the constitutionality of affirmative action \n     programs in certain circumstances?\n       Response. I can assure the Committee that I would \n     faithfully apply the Miranda decision as I would any other \n     Supreme Court case that has not been superseded by the Court. \n     With respect to Bakke specifically, in which there was no \n     majority opinion by the Court, there is arguably a division \n     among the courts of appeals on the question whether the \n     various opinions issued by the individual Justices who \n     participated in the case set forth a rule of law that lower \n     courts are required to follow. Compare Hopwood v. Texas, 78 \n     F.3d 932, 944 (5th Cir. 1996), and Johnson v. Board of \n     Regents of Univ. Georgia, 263 F.3d 1234, 1247-50, 1261 (11th \n     Cir. 2001), with Smith v. University of Washington Law Sch., \n     233 F.3d 1188, 1199-1200 (9th Cir. 2000), and Grutter v. \n     Bollinger, 288 F.3d 732, 738-42 (6th Cir. 2002). As I stated \n     during my appearance before the Committee, because that issue \n     might come before me as judge, I do not believe I should \n     express any views on it.\n       (6) Let me ask you about two other controversial positions \n     that CCI has adopted in the last few years. In United States \n     v. Knights, CCI argued as an amicus party that warrantless, \n     suspicionless searches of probationers and parolees are \n     constitutional. Likewise, in Department of Housing and Urban \n     Development v. Rucker, CCI defended HUD's so-called ``One-\n     Strike'' policy, which permitted automatic eviction of an \n     entire household from public housing if any resident or guest \n     was involved in a drug-related crime.\n       (a) As a Director of CCI, did you participate in \n     deliberations or play any other role in the group's decision \n     to file an amicus brief in Knights or Rucker?\n       Response. I do not have any recollection of participating \n     in any Board deliberations concerning these two cases. I have \n     made inquiry of the CCI staff, and I have been advised that \n     neither case came before the Board during my tenure as a \n     Board member. In the case of Rucker, it appears that CCI \n     became involved in the litigation while the case was pending \n     in the lower federal courts, and thus the issue whether to \n     participate in the litigation came before the Board before I \n     became a Board member. In the case of Knights, I have been \n     advised that CCI's position echoed the view taken by CCI in a \n     1997 case that presented a similar issue. I am advised that \n     because the issue already had been addressed by the Board in \n     connection with that 1997 case, the Executive Committee of \n     the Board (of which I was not a member) authorized the filing \n     of the brief without further input from other Board members.\n       (b) Do you support the group's position in either of these \n     cases? Why or why not?\n       Response. I have not made a sufficient, independent study \n     of the issues and briefing in each case to know whether I \n     agree with the positions espoused by CCI in these cases. I \n     would note, however, that each case resulted in a unanimous \n     opinion by the Supreme Court that appears to vindicate the \n     position urged by CCI.\n       (7) It is difficult to find a news account about your \n     nomination that fails to mention your status as a potential \n     nominee of President Bush to the Supreme Court. Frankly, I \n     think this speculation is very premature. You do not have any \n     judicial record yet, so it is hard to know what kind of judge \n     you will be on the Court of Appeals.\n       (a) Have you given any thought to whether you might like to \n     serve on the Supreme Court someday? What are your aspirations \n     at this point in your career?\n       Response. During the pendency of my nomination, my wife and \n     I occasionally have received from friends, acquaintances and \n     well-wishers copies of the types of newspaper articles to \n     which your question refers. I have seen some of those \n     articles in our local newspapers as well. Of course, any \n     lawyer would be honored to be viewed as someone who some day \n     might be considered for a position on the Supreme Court. \n     However, beyond discussing with friends and acquaintances the \n     contents of such press articles, I have not carefully \n     considered the issue. As your question points out, it would \n     be premature for me to do so. My aspirations at this point \n     are to be confirmed as a United States Circuit Judge, and to \n     discharge the duties of that position to the best of my \n     abilities.\n       (b) Has anyone from the White House or the Justice \n     Department ever discussed with you the prospect of serving on \n     the Supreme Court someday? If so, what did he or she tell \n     you?\n       Response. No one from the White House or the Justice \n     Department has discussed with me the prospect of serving on \n     the Supreme Court of the United States.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I do not want to read them all, but I will \nif I have to, and I think the distinguished Senator from Illinois ought \nto be fair.\n  These answers are very competent, good answers by a very competent, \nwell-qualified, terrific nominee for the Circuit Court of Appeals for \nthe District of Columbia, the first Hispanic nominee in the history of \nthis country. I suggest you read your own answers to your own \nquestions, and I think you will be pretty impressed with him.\n  (Mr. ENSIGN assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. Without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Would the Senator concede it is virtually impossible to \nconduct a debate in this format where every question I ask is \nquestioned? Will the Senator be willing to enter into a unanimous \nconsent agreement for the next half hour, equally divide the time \nbetween us, and then return the floor to the Senator from Utah so we \ncan have a real debate rather than a contrived attempt to ask questions \nand to make rebuttals to statements made on the floor?\n  Mr. HATCH. Of course I will not. First, I have the floor and I am \nretaining the floor because I have questions from both sides. I am \nwilling to take questions from your side. I am not ignoring those. It \nis about time the American people hear the truth. We have heard enough \nrubbish. Now we should hear the truth. In all honesty, that is what we \nare going to do this evening.\n  I have heard a lot of ridiculous remarks over there that do not \nreally deserve listening to. So we are going to hear some remarks \ntonight that deserve being listened to, and we are going to get the \nfacts. This unmitigated bullcorn that he has not answered questions is \nexactly that.\n  I think the distinguished Junior Senator from Tennessee tore the hide \noff the Democrats tonight. I was so doggone impressed, I want to \ncompliment my colleague. But he was not the only one. I have had \ncolleague after colleague stand up over here and tell the truth, and I \nhave had colleague after colleague over there hide behind these phony \nissues they have raised. They are phony, and it is a double standard. I \nam ashamed of some of the arguments that have been made over there, \nabsolutely ashamed, and every Hispanic in America ought to be ashamed \nthat they would stoop to this level against a qualified nominee. But \nnot just every Hispanic, every American who wants a great judiciary \nought to be outraged by what is happening.\n  I have never seen this type of treatment of anybody who has been \nnominated to a circuit court of appeals. I have seen some pretty shabby \ntreatment in my day for some of the people who have been appointed by \nRepublican Presidents, but nobody has had to endure the calumny and the \ndownright despicable comments that this Hispanic nominee, with all \nthese qualifications in the world, has had to endure. It is disgusting.\n  I know there are people on the other side who have clear thinking who \nought to be disturbed by this, and I hope they will rise up in that \ncaucus and say, we have had enough of this. We should not be treating \nany American this way, let alone somebody like this Hispanic.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Utah yield for a \nparliamentary inquiry?\n  Mr. HATCH. Not at this point. I would like to finish what I am \nsaying.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President.\n  Mr. HATCH. Without losing my right to the floor, I am happy to yield \nfor a parliamentary inquiry.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would ask the Chair to determine if the \nword ``despicable'' relating to the remarks that we have been making \nfor 10 days----\n  Mr. HATCH. I withdraw the word. I ask unanimous consent that that \nword be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S2808]]\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Even though I think it was probably the right word to use.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Virginia without \nlosing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. ALLEN. I ask the Senator from Utah to yield for a question.\n  Mr. HATCH. Without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, Senator Warner, who was presiding earlier, \nknows the Senator from Utah is not alone in the feelings he is \nexpressing. We see it in Virginia. In fact, we see it all the way \nacross the Nation, from the San Diego Tribune to all the papers in \nVirginia that have taken a stand on this issue. They state the \nDemocrats are creating a new double standard that applies only to the \nnomination of Miguel Estrada. Editorials are unanimous in Virginia, \nwhether it is the Fredericksburg Free Lance-Star, the Richmond Times-\nDispatch, even the Winchester Star out in the Shenandoah Valley. They \nall say, stop filibustering, take a stand and confirm this highly \nqualified nominee. The Winchester Star in particular--and, by the way, \nthat is a newspaper that is owned by a former colleague of some of our \nMembers, Senator Harry Byrd, and they wrote in particular that the \nrequest for the Solicitor General memoranda is outrageous and that to \naccede to it would compromise that body's ability to properly defend \nthe Government's interests.\n  Is the Senator from Utah aware that even editorial writers in this \nfine community in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia found this \nDemocratic request so improper?\n  Mr. HATCH. I was not aware of that. But I have to say, I served with \nSenator Harry Byrd. He is a marvelous human being. He was an \nIndependent who voted mainly with the Democrats, but a very fair, \nhonorable, decent man, one of the finest people who ever served. I \nagree with the editorial 100 percent.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. HATCH. Without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Could the Senator share with us what the historical \npractices are as far as the deliberative memoranda are concerned? Have \nthey ever been asked for in confirmation hearings? We are talking about \nthis double standard. They are asking for something, but what is the \nrecord? Has this ever been asked for before?\n  Mr. HATCH. No one before this nominee, to my knowledge--and I believe \nI am accurate, and we have checked it--no one has ever asked for appeal \nrecommendations, certiorari recommendations, and amicus curiae \nrecommendations. The reason they never have is that it is--I will use \nthe term--despicable to ask for them because they know they cannot be \ngiven; that no self-respecting Attorney General or President would \nallow that to happen because that is a direct intrusion into the \ndeliberative process of the Solicitor General's Office, the attorney \nfor the people. Nobody else has ever done that before.\n  So we have to ask, why is it being done? And why would seven former \nSolicitors General, four of whom are Democrats, come out and say this \ncannot be done? Because they are right and my colleagues on the other \nside are wrong. They know they are wrong. I think that was geared to \ntry to create a red herring issue so they could say, oh, my goodness, \nwe do not know enough about him.\n  It took them 505 days to hold a hearing. I presume in that 505 days, \nknowing how the Judiciary Committee works--and I really know how it \nworks--every Democrat staffer assigned to that was going through every \ndocument this man has ever had anything to do with. They scrutinized \nhim like they scrutinize any criminal, and certainly he is not that. \nBut they scrutinized him. That is not a bad thing. I am not criticizing \nthem for that. They know everything about Miguel Estrada that is \nknowable, and there is a lot. The transcript of the hearing is that \nbig. Gee whiz, they act like there were not any questions or answers. \nAre you kidding? I think they think sometimes they can say these things \nand the American people are just going to buy it. Well, we are going to \nmake sure they do not buy it because it is not true. That is what is \nkilling me, is that my colleagues are saying things that just simply \nare not true if one looks at the Record.\n\n  Never before have those three areas of recommendations been asked \nfor. They cite Robert Bork. They cite Justice Rehnquist. Those \nmaterials that were given were very limited. They were not anywhere \nnear as sensitive as these. They were not necessarily privileged, \nalthough I believe some of them were given just because they were very \nlimited requests. These are broad requests of documents that literally \nshould never be given to any other branch of government, if we want a \nfunctioning Solicitor General's Office.\n  This is a game being played. It is a double standard and very unfair \nto this nominee. I think my colleagues are pointing that out in no \nuncertain terms.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, will the Senator from Utah yield for a \nfinal question?\n  Mr. HATCH. Without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. ALLEN. I ask the Senator from Utah if he saw the responses that \nall of us were seeing, as this filibuster drags on, this unfair \nconsideration of Miguel Estrada, whom Senator Warner and I introduced \nto the committee nearly a year and a half after the President nominated \nhim back in September--is he aware as more and more people read about \nthis and hear about it that he is getting more support?\n  Our senatorial committee Web site has had over 20,000 petitions in \nsupport of President Bush's nomination of this outstanding hero. Is the \nSenator aware that Miguel Estrada is the American dream, the American \ndream being born these days--not in the days of Horatio Alger, but \nindividually came to this country with his own hard work, studiousness, \nand efforts, rose to lead the Law Review at Harvard, and other \npositions in government. Is he aware that support is building by the \nhour for Miguel Estrada and also in opposition to these obstructionist \ntactics denying this man a fair up-or-down vote?\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I have talked to a wide variety of people today and every \nday. I have been on radio shows talking about this. I have been on \nHispanic radio shows, Latino radio shows. They are getting very angry. \nAnd they should.\n  I am calling upon all Democrats, Independents, and Republicans, as \nwell, to come out of the woodwork and let our friends on the other side \nof the floor know this will not last. They resent this. There is a \nprice to be paid for this type of obstruction, which is what it is. \nThis is unfair obstruction that we did not do to their nominees.\n  I cannot understand for the life of me why they are doing it to this \nHispanic nominee with all these credentials, with the gold standard \nhighest rating of the American Bar Association--their gold standard by \ntheir own definition. I do not understand it personally. I cannot see \none reason to do it. People are getting very upset. I am getting \nthousands of calls saying: Hang in there; do not let them get away with \nthis or the whole judiciary will be hurt; the whole judiciary will be \nhurt if this continues.\n  If we have a filibuster that continues like this, our colleagues on \nthe other side are risking the complete breakdown of this process, the \ncomplete breakdown of the judicial nominating process, something that \nwe have never done on our side.\n  Even when there have been cloture votes where they were not true \nfilibusters but still cloture votes, their nominees got votes up and \ndown.\n  If that is what they are about, I will shut up and not say much more. \nThat is all we are saying. Just vote. All this complaining. Yesterday, \nI saw the minority leader come on the floor and say we should be \ngetting about all the important business of the country. There is \nnothing more important in this country than having a fair judiciary. It \nis the judiciary that has saved the Constitution through all these \nyears. This is a very important nominee and a very important court. If \nwe do not do what is right, everything else that is important might not \nbe as important in the future because we will not have a Constitution \nto abide by and live by that has kept this country free. This is very \nimportant.\n  To come from that side, when last year for the first time since the \nBudget Act was enacted, they did not pass a\n\n[[Page S2809]]\n\nbudget because they had to face what we always did--it is tough to do \nit. They were not willing to put up with it and do the tough things, \nnor did they pass the majority of the appropriation bills. We had to \nwait until we became the majority, and we did it in an omnibus after \nthe first of the year, but only after delays caused by the other side.\n  It was something I could hardly believe. I said if you want to get to \nthe other important things which we do, too, have a vote up and down \nlike we did for all of your nominees. Why treat this man differently? \nWhy obstruct this nominee? Why play the politics of obstruction? Why be \nso unfair and why have this double standard?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I am happy to yield to the distinguished Senator from \nNorth Carolina, and then I will yield to--\n  Mr. REID. I object. This is not proper procedure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has the floor and may \nyield.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield to the distinguished Senator from North Carolina \nfor a question, without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, in North Carolina the Kinston Free Press \nand the Winston-Salem Journal have called on Democrats to stop this \nfilibuster. Even a student writer for the University of North Carolina \nschool paper took the time to write about it and criticize the \nfilibuster. This obstructionism is being noticed and people are angry.\n  On this question of the Solicitor General's memos, the Winston-Salem \nJournal wrote: ``Congress should not be asking for such material.''\n  Does the Senator from Utah agree with the journal that ``if Democrats \nhave a substantive reason for opposing Estrada's nomination, it is past \ntime to produce it. If not, they should let the Senate vote.''\n  Does the Senator agree?\n  Mr. HATCH. I sure do agree with that. There has not been one \nsubstantive argument against this man other than the phony arguments \nlike getting these privileged documents that everyone knows the \nadministration cannot get. There are two reasons for that: They want to \nembarrass the administration by trying to make the administration look \nlike they are trying to withhold documents that they should give, when \nthey should not give them; and they are trying to defeat Miguel Estrada \non what is really a red herring issue.\n  That particular editorial of the Winston-Salem Journal said: The \ntruth is, the Democrats oppose Estrada because they believe he is too \nconservative; an unsavory implication is that they believe Hispanics \nshould be liberal.\n  I think the editorial got it right on the money.\n  Another truth is, as the Senator said: The Constitution gives \nPresidents the right to nominate judges and the Presidents usually \nchoose nominees they believe share their political views. If Democrats \nhave a substantive reason for opposing Estrada's nomination, it is past \ntime to produce it. If not, they should let the Senate vote.\n  I ask unanimous consent the Winston-Salem Journal article be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the Winston-Salem Journal, Feb. 20, 2003]\n\n                            Choosing Judges\n\n       Democratic and Republican senators have taken turns for \n     years behaving badly when it comes to federal judicial \n     nominees. Now Democrats have taken the unproductive battles \n     to a new low in their refusal to allow a vote on the \n     nomination of Miguel Estrada to the U.S. Court of Appeals for \n     the District of Columbia.\n       It's true that Senate Republicans are guilty of \n     considerable hypocrisy. They bottled up many of President \n     Clinton's nominees in the Judiciary Committee and kept even \n     moderate nominees from having hearings on the Senate floor. \n     Then when President Bush began sending along nominees, \n     Republicans urged Democrats to abandon partisanship and vote \n     for judicial nominees on their merits, not their views.\n       But Democrats haven't helped matters any by their \n     determination to get revenge. The result is more delays in \n     filling court vacancies and more harm to the federal judicial \n     system.\n       President Bush stoked the fire by nominating some \n     controversial figures, most notably U.S. District Judge \n     Charles Pickering of Mississippi for the 5th Circuit Court of \n     Appeals, while Democrats held their slim majority in the \n     Senate. Pickering was a controversial choice largely because \n     of his record on race. Democrats voted down his nomination in \n     the Judiciary Committee. Their opposition to him was probably \n     justified, but they should have allowed a vote. The entire \n     Senate, not just the members of the Judiciary Committee, are \n     supposed to have the right to confirm a president's judicial \n     choices.\n       Now Republicans are back in control of the Senate. \n     Democrats' refusal to allow a vote on Estrada's nomination is \n     worse than their opposition to Pickering, because Estrada \n     does not have any blots on his record comparable to \n     Pickering's. His is an inspiring success story of a Honduran \n     immigrant who became editor of the Harvard Law Review and a \n     clerk for U.S. Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy. He was \n     an assistant solicitor general under Clinton. He's been rated \n     ``highly qualified'' by the American Bar Association.\n       Democrats have come up with a variety of objections to \n     Estrada, none of them convincing. They question his youth and \n     lack of judicial experience, but other appeals court judges \n     have been confirmed with similar qualifications. They have \n     demanded that he turn over confidential papers from his years \n     as solicitor general. Congress should not be asking for such \n     material, as all living solicitors general have said in a \n     letter.\n       Democrats have said that Bush nominated Estrada just \n     because he is Hispanic.\n       The truth is that Democrats oppose Estrada because they \n     believe that he is too conservative. An unsavory implication \n     is that they believe Hispanics should be liberal.\n       Another truth is that the Constitution gives presidents the \n     right to nominate judges, and that presidents usually choose \n     nominees who they believe share their political views. If \n     Democrats have a substantive reason for opposing Estrada's \n     nomination, it's past time to produce it. If not, they should \n     let the Senate vote.\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Utah, I have \nread an editorial from the Riverside Press Enterprise in California \nwhich said in response to this fishing expedition on the confidential \nmemoranda that the Democrats claim they want to review Mr. Estrada's \nlegal views: One suspects that is not the role the Democrats have in \nmind for their memoranda. They probably hope to expose Mr. Estrada's \nconservative views, which no one doubts he holds, in hopes of defeating \nthe nomination or at least scoring some political points.\n  Does the Senator agree that is the reason they are doing what they \nare doing, trying to score political points?\n  Mr. HATCH. I don't see how they score political points by \nfilibustering the first Hispanic nominee ever nominated to the court of \nappeals for the District of Columbia. That is a heck of a way to score \npolitical points, unless it is with their really far left people who \nseem to be in domination of that party right now. They are pleased.\n  People for the American Way, you have to really be on the left to be \nwith them. In fact, their biggest support comes from Hollywood. Not \nthat we should decry our Hollywood stars as experts on everything. I \ndon't think we should always find them not to be. I am sure they are \nexperts on some things, but they seem to not fully understand what is \ngoing on here.\n  The Press Enterprise, Riverside, CA, editorial says: The Democrats \ntactic employed last week of filibustering the nomination of Miguel A. \nEstrada to be the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia \nCircuit is an anything-goes strategy that ought to be abandoned.\n  And then later: A first step would be to not filibuster nominations \nlike this one.\n  They say: ``Parties need to deescalate.'' I agree with that.\n  A first step would be to not filibuster nominations like this one of \na well-qualified nominees. He's distinctly an American success story, \nhaving immigrated from Honduras, gone to Columbia and Harvard, and \nserved as a clerk to a Supreme Court Justice.\n  I ask unanimous consent the Press Enterprise editorial be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       [From the Press-Enterprise (Riverside, CA) Feb. 18, 2003]\n\n       The process of filling a vacancy in the federal judiciary \n     is a political one. The Founding Fathers placed it into a \n     political area. The president nominates and the Senate \n     confirms--or doesn't--but that doesn't mean anything goes.\n\n[[Page S2810]]\n\n       The Democrats' tactic employed last week of filibustering \n     the nomination of Miguel A. Estrada to the U.S. Court of \n     Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is an anything-\n     goes strategy that ought to be abandoned. However, with 49 \n     Democratic senators, they are likely to be able to muster the \n     41 votes needed to maintain a filibuster.\n       What makes the filibuster inappropriate is that it is \n     rarely used to block a judicial nominee, and Mr. Estrada \n     hardly qualifies as a target for such a big gun. Yes, he was \n     not completely open with members of the Judiciary Committee \n     when he appeared, and Democratic senators are frustrated by \n     the White House's refusal to release to them memoranda he \n     wrote as solicitor general.\n       But in the best of times, such a request would be out of \n     line, and these are closer to the worst than to the best for \n     the nomination process. If the memoranda were to be used as \n     an honest beginning to a discussion of Mr. Estrada's legal \n     views, there might be some justification for releasing the \n     documents that would normally be considered privileged.\n       One suspects that's not the role the Democrats have in mind \n     for the memoranda. They probably hope to expose Mr. Estrada's \n     conservative views, which no one doubts he holds, in hopes of \n     defeating the nomination or at least scoring some political \n     points.\n       The two parties have been allowing their political battles \n     over judicial nominees to escalate since Robert H. Bork's \n     nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1987. One suspects \n     that Republicans, if they were in the minority, would have \n     done the same with the Estrada nomination. The parties need \n     to de-escalate.\n       A first step would be to not filibuster nominations like \n     this one of a well-qualified nominee. He's distinctly an \n     American success story, having immigrated from Honduras, gone \n     to Columbia and Harvard and served as a clerk to a Supreme \n     Court justice.\n       Democrats, or Republicans when they are in the minority, \n     may fairly make things tough on a nominee in committee or on \n     the Senate floor, in order to fashion nominations more to \n     their liking. But the process has to stop at some point. It's \n     one of advice and consent, not advise and confront.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. Without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The Senator, as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, \ndisclosed the Department of Justice has declined to produce these \ninternal memoranda. I ask the Senator this: Is it a fact those \nmemoranda belong to the U.S. Department of Justice and under the \nattorney-client rule they are not Miguel Estrada's and he has no \nability whatsoever to produce these documents?\n  Mr. HATCH. I certainly agree. I have heard the distinguished Senator \nfrom Illinois say that he should have produced these documents. He has \nno right to produce them. He personally said I am proud of my work. If \nthey can give it up, I would be proud to have it given up. But he knows \nthey cannot. I believe the distinguished Senator from Illinois knows \nthey cannot give up these documents. Everybody knows that. That is why \nit is such a phony red herring issue, but it is the only one they \nreally have.\n  They started off with he has not had any judicial experience. That is \nthe phoniest thing of all, because that means virtually every Hispanic \nlawyer doesn't have a chance to be on the Federal bench because they \nhave no judicial experience, in spite of the fact that five of the \neight judges on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals had no judicial \nexperience before they went on the court.\n  Why the double standard? Why is it we are requiring this of Miguel \nEstrada but not of them? Why is it when Republicans ran the committee \nwe didn't have that difficulty? We never raised that phony issue. Why \nis it raised now?\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. Without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Chairman Hatch, I know you chaired the committee and \nyou conducted many hearings, both in your recent chairmanship and prior \nto that when you were chairman of the committee. But isn't it a fact \nthat the hearing of Miguel Estrada was conducted when the Democrats \nwere in control of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Leahy was the \nchairman, and they held the committee hearing as long as they chose and \ncould have held even longer hearings had they had any further questions \nto ask?\n  Mr. HATCH. It is a fact that they were in control. They chaired the \nhearings. Senator Schumer chaired the hearing at the direction of \nChairman Leahy, the chairman. It was one of the longest hearings for a \nCircuit Court of Appeals nominee I can recall. They asked every \nquestion they wanted to. He answered them, and he answered them fairly \nand well, as I have been showing here tonight, and as the distinguished \nJunior Senator from Tennessee, I think, showed in detail earlier in the \nevening. I commend him and ask everybody to read that.\n  In all honesty, they controlled the whole doggone process. They even \nsaid on the floor, even during this debate, that the hearing was fair--\nbecause they conducted it. If it was fair, that means they covered all \nthe questions they wanted answered.\n  Then we have these phony arguments that he didn't answer the \nquestion. Read the remarks of the distinguished Senator from Tennessee, \nSenator Alexander, this evening and read the transcript. Read the \nanswers to these written questions. I only read a few of them because \nit more than blew away those phony arguments. Why the double standard? \nWhy the obstruction? Why are we going through this?\n  I said I would yield to my friend and colleague from Nevada, without \nlosing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I would say to my friend, I would respectfully submit, you \ndon't need to say ``without losing your right to the floor.'' You have \nthe floor. You don't have to say that.\n  Anyway, I ask my distinguished friend from Utah, the neighboring \nState to Nevada: It is true, is it not, whether you agree or not, we \nhave asked that the Justice Department, the administration, release the \nmemos written by Miguel Estrada when he worked for the Solicitor's \nOffice? You would agree with that?\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I agree Senator Leahy sent a letter to the Department of \nJustice asking for these privileged matters that have never been given \nup before, and will not be given up, and should not be given up; \nknowing, I think, deep down, that they would not be given up.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator, of course, is aware----\n  Mr. HATCH. I think it is a political game, if you want to know.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator has stated in answer to the question of the \ndistinguished Senator from Alabama that Miguel Estrada has no ability \nto have these released, is that true?\n  Mr. HATCH. That is correct. He doesn't control the Justice \nDepartment. He is no longer an employee of the Justice Department. Nor \nshould he ask the Justice Department for these records.\n  Mr. REID. I further ask the Senator, it is true, however, that the \nadministration, whether through the counsel's office of the President, \nthe President himself, or the Attorney General, could release those \nmaterials?\n  Mr. HATCH. No, it isn't true. I don't believe the Attorney General \ncould. I don't think any responsible Attorney General could release \nthose. If you are saying is it theoretically possible for somebody to \ndisobey the law, the rules, to not live up to the privileged and \nconfidential information, to ignore every aspect of the executive \nbranch of Government--I suppose somebody could say yes. But I can't. I \ndon't think he would have--I don't think the Attorney General has that \nprivilege; no, I don't.\n  Mr. REID. Let me ask the Senator this question. Are you saying on the \nfive occasions we know of, there could be more, when the Attorney \nGeneral released memoranda from the Solicitor's Office relating to \nRehnquist, Bork, Civiletti, and others, that they were violating the \nlaw when they released those documents?\n  Mr. HATCH. They were completely different documents. They had nothing \nto do with recommendations for appeals, certiorari petitions, or amicus \ncuriae matters. No. They have never, ever been asked for before, to my \nknowledge, and they have never, ever been given, nor would they.\n  By the way, there have been some limited documents given by the \nJustice Department in some nomination matters, none of them related to \nwhat were requested by the Senate Democrats in this matter. And there \nare only a couple of cases where the Attorney General did allow that.\n  The other cases, they appeared to have been leaked by friends of \nDemocrats at the Justice Department. So they were not given up by the \nJustice\n\n[[Page S2811]]\n\nDepartment. We have more than made that case throughout this debate. \nThere is no question about it. And it is just another phony argument. I \ndo not blame my colleague from Nevada for not knowing that. But I think \nit is time to learn it.\n  Mr. REID. Could I ask the Senator another question?\n  Mr. HATCH. Sure.\n  Mr. REID. I don't mind the Senator commenting on my intelligence.\n  Mr. HATCH. I think the Senator is very intelligent.\n  Mr. REID. Let me just complete my question. The Senator has knowledge \nthat on occasions there have been memos released from the Solicitor \nGeneral's Office relating to matters before the Senate. I ask the \nquestion of the Senator from Utah, does that mean on those occasions \nwhen they were released, a law was violated?\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I am sorry, I missed that.\n  Mr. REID. We have established in the dialog between the Senator from \nUtah and the Senator from Nevada that there have been occasions where \nthe Solicitor's memos have been given to the Senate. The Senator says \nthey have been on rare occasions, two occasions, I think the Senator \nfrom Utah said. We say five. But on those occasions, does the Senator \nbelieve that the law was violated, and those people who released those \nmemos should have been prosecuted in some way?\n  Mr. HATCH. They were not the same papers, they were not privileged, \nconfidential documents of the order of magnitude that these are.\n  Let me add, the Clinton nominee--this is a Caucasian, by the way, not \na Hispanic. The Clinton nominee, William Bryce, who was confirmed to \nthe Federal circuit in 1994, was an assistant Solicitor General, just \nlike Miguel Estrada. But nobody asked for his memoranda from his time \nin the Solicitor General's Office. He is one of eight former Solicitor \nGeneral Office attorneys who have been confirmed at circuit courts \nwithout disclosure of their memoranda.\n  Why the double standard? Why do we do this to the only Hispanic who \nhas ever been nominated for the Circuit Court of Appeals? And why are \nthe Democrats doing this to this Hispanic man? Why are they being so \nunfair? We never did it. We wouldn't dare do it. The fact of the matter \nis, I don't think anybody who understands the nature of the Solicitor \nGeneral's Office, and apparently some on your side don't seem to \nunderstand that----\n  Mr. REID. If my friend will yield for one final question?\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me just finish my remarks and I will go to your final \nquestion.\n  Why the double standard? Is there a specific allegation that my \ncolleagues are concerned about for which they want to review these \nhighly confidential documents? If there is, I would like to know what \nit is. I don't want a fishing expedition, even if we could give them. I \ndon't think there is a good explanation as to why they want these \ndocuments. I think that is why everyone who looks at this in fairness \nviews it as nothing but a fishing expedition, which is exactly what it \nis.\n  We couldn't get Miguel Estrada any other way, so why don't we go fish \nthrough all these documents and find just something to pin our \nantagonism towards him on, so we do not look so doggone bad? Frankly, I \nthink the arguments on the other side look terrible.\n  Mr. GREGG. Point of order.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a final question?\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me yield for one final question by the distinguished \nminority whip, and then I will yield to someone on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada has the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to the distinguished Senator from \nUtah----\n  Mr. HATCH. I want to do this in fairness.\n  Mr. REID. Bork, Civiletti, Rehnquist, and two others, none of whom \nare Hispanics--and I think a person's ethnicity has nothing to do with \nthe point we have made. The point we have made is on other occasions, \nmemos from the Solicitor General's Office have been made public in this \nbody.\n  Mr. HATCH. Can I correct the Senator? They were not Solicitor General \nmemoranda. They had nothing from the Solicitor's Office.\n  Mr. REID. I would respectfully submit we have in the Record, admitted \nyesterday, letters exchanged with Senator Biden and the Solicitor \nGeneral at that time, Bolton, who was Solicitor General, that laid out \nin some detail the materials that were obtained, and in addition to \nthat we have other materials obtained from the Solicitor General's \nOffice that were memoranda. They are either legal or they are not.\n\n  I have to ask the Senator this question: If these memos were \nrelevant--I repeat that they were. It is in the Record. We have dates \non the letters of when they were exchanged between the Solicitors \nGeneral and Senator Biden, who was chairman of the committee at that \ntime. I respectfully submit to my friend they are not legal. The \ndecision made by the administration is that they are not going to \nrelease these documents.\n  Mr. HATCH. Does the Senator have a question for me?\n  Mr. REID. Was not a decision made by this administration that they \nare not going to release these documents even though they have in the \npast?\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me answer in this way. Nobody has previously asked for \nappeal recommendations in the Solicitor General's Office--some of the \nmost important work that is done; certiorari recommendations in the \nSolicitor General's Office; some of the most important work done by \nthat office; or amicus curiae recommendations, some of the most \nimportant work done in that office.\n  Let me read from the letter from the Department of Justice about what \nit has to say about this in response to this type of allegation by the \nDemocrats.\n\n       Of the seven cited nominees--\n\n  Remember. We hear all about all of these people who got Department of \nJustice materials. Let us look at the facts. I hope my colleague will \nlisten to some. I hope my other colleagues will listen because we have \nhad these false arguments made day in and day out. So I am going to put \nthem to bed right now.\n\n       Of the seven cited nominees, the hearings of only two, \n     Judge Bork and Judge Easterbrook, involved documents from \n     their service in the Office of the Solicitor General. Senator \n     Schumer placed into Mr. Estrada's hearing record a single, \n     two-page amicus recommendation memorandum that Judge \n     Easterbrook authorized as an Assistant to the Solicitor \n     General. The official record of Judge Easterbrook's \n     confirmation hearing contains no references to this document \n     and based on a comprehensive review of the department's files \n     we do not believe that the department authorized its release \n     in connection with Judge Easterbrook's nomination. Senator \n     Schumer's possession of this memorandum does not suggest that \n     the department waived applicable privileges and authorized \n     its disclosure in connection with Judge Easterbrook's or any \n     other nomination.\n\n  In other words, someone leaked that document illegally. And my \ncolleagues have an illegal document leaked. At least that seems to be \nthe glaring thing that happened here.\n  The Justice Department goes on to say:\n\n       The hearing record of Judge Bork's nomination to the \n     Supreme Court demonstrates that the committee received access \n     to a limited number of documents related to three specific \n     subjects of heightened interest to the committee, two of \n     which were related to Judge Bork's involvement in Watergate-\n     related issues and triggered specific concerns by the \n     committee.\n\n  We have not had specific concerns here. All we have is a fishing \nexpedition. These are with specific concerns.\n  Let us go further with what the Justice Department says:\n\n       The vast majority of memoranda authored or received by \n     Judge Bork when he served as Solicitor General were neither \n     sought nor produced. And the limited category of documents \n     that were produced for the committee did not reveal the \n     internal deliberative recommendations or analysis of \n     assistants to the Solicitor General regarding appeal, \n     certiorari, or amicus recommendations in pending cases. The \n     remaining five nominations cited at the hearings similarly do \n     not justify the disclosure of deliberative material authored \n     by Mr. Estrada. None of the limited documents disclosed in \n     the hearings for these five nominations involved deliberative \n     memoranda from the Office of Solicitor General. The \n     committee, with respect to these five nominations, requested \n     specific documents primarily related to allegations of \n     miscondcut or malfeasance identified by the committee. \n     Moreover, as noted before with respect to the nomination of \n     Judge Trott, the committee requested documents wholly\n\n[[Page S2812]]\n\n     unrelated to Judge Trott's service at the department.\n\n  Again, a vast majority of deliberative memoranda authored or received \nby these nominees were never sought nor received by the committee.\n\n       In sum, the existence of a few isolated examples where the \n     executive branch on occasion called for very specific \n     information does not in any way alter the fundamental and \n     long-standing principle that memoranda from the Office of the \n     Solicitor General and deliberative Department of Justice \n     materials more broadly must remain protected in the \n     confirmation context so as to maintain the integrity of the \n     executive branch's decision-making process.\n       In conclusion, we emphasis that the Department of Justice \n     appreciates and profoundly respects the Judiciary Committee's \n     legitimate need to evaluate Mr. Estrada's qualification for \n     the Federal bench. We again suggest, however, that the \n     information currently available is more than adequate to \n     allow the committee to determine whether Mr. Estrada is \n     qualified to be a Federal judge.\n\n  I might just add again that this is more than adequate. This is more \nthan has been asked of any nominee in history. Why the obstruction? Why \nthe unfairness? Why are we so unfair to this Hispanic man who has all \nthese qualifications that normally would blow people's minds--and do \nblow people's minds he is so qualified. Yet here he is being \nfilibustered by my colleagues.\n  I call on my colleagues of goodwill to quit playing games and start \ndoing what is right.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield to the distinguished Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, there have been several editorials \nwritten by newspapers in my State that are very critical of the \nDemocrats for the obstructionist attitude and filibustering of this \nparticular nomination of Miguel Estrada. One of those editorials was \nwritten by the Atlanta Constitution, which is extremely critical of the \nprocess the Democrats are going through tonight as they have for the \nlast 3 weeks. The Atlanta Constitution is one of the most liberal \npapers in the United States of America.\n  Mr. HATCH. That has been my experience.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. With respect to this issue of the memoranda that they \nhave requested be produced by Mr. Estrada or by the Justice Department, \nI note that the Savannah Morning News in Savannah, GA, has written that \nthe ``request is unprecedented''--that ``the Democratic leadership \nwants to continue trolling further and further from shore in a \ndesperate attempt to find something--anything--they can hang an \naccusation on.''\n  They even write that perhaps they could subpoena a list of videotapes \nthat Mr. Estrada rented as they did for Supreme Court nominee Robert \nBork.\n  Does the Senator from Utah agree that this is a true fishing \nexpedition as he has previously alluded, and if the Democratic \nleadership doesn't like what they have so far they can still vote \nagainst Mr. Estrada?\n  Mr. HATCH. I have been an attorney for a long, long time. I know a \nfishing expedition when I see one. I have been a Senator for 27 years. \nI have seen fishing expeditions before but never one as blatantly as \nthis one, or exploiting a red herring issue like they are trying to do \non this one.\n  I compliment the Senator. Let me read from the editorial in the \nSavannah Morning News just a couple of paragraphs.\n\n       The Democrats are upset because they haven't found a \n     ``gotcha'' moment in Mr. Estrada's testimony or scholarship \n     that would embarrass or contradict him, and thus provide them \n     ammunition to defeat his nomination.\n\n  Then they went on to quote saying what the Senator from Georgia \nquoted.\n\n       They want to continue trolling further.\n\n  This is trolling like you have never seen before.\n  Then the next paragraph says:\n\n       The problem is, they've already had ample opportunities. If \n     they weren't happy with his answers at his hearing last \n     September, Democrats could have demanded another hearing. \n     They did not. Nor did they take full advantage of normal \n     procedure and submit written follow-up questions to Mr. \n     Estrada after the hearing--only two of the 10 committee \n     Democrats did so.\n       Because they lack the votes to defeat the nomination on the \n     Senate floor they have resorted to manipulating the process \n     by any means necessary--not, mind you, because they have \n     evidence to oppose him, but because they don't.\n\n  Boy, I agree with that editorial.\n  Then they conclude by saying:\n\n       Mr. Estrada's nomination deserves an up-or-down vote in the \n     Senate and not be held hostage by bipartisan parliamentary \n     games.\n\n  I tell you, that sentence: Because they lack the votes to defeat the \nnomination on the Senate floor, they have resorted to manipulating the \nprocess by any means necessary, not, mind you, because they have \nevidence to oppose him, but because they don't.\n  This editorial writer and these writers get it accurately. They have \nnot laid a glove on Miguel Estrada. Here we are in the third week of a \nfilibuster against the only Hispanic nominee in the history of the \ncountry nominated to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of \nColumbia.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Savannah Now editorial be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the Savannah Morning News, Feb. 13, 2003]\n\n                         Democrats Hold Hostage\n\n       Miguel Estrada is President Bush's nominee to serve on the \n     federal appeals court for the District of Columbia, regarded \n     as the second-highest court in the land behind the U.S. \n     Supreme Court.\n       He's young (41), a Hispanic immigrant success story (he was \n     born and raised in Honduras before moving to the United \n     States at age 17 and learning English) and generally \n     conservative. That, and the fact that the D.C. appeals court \n     is widely viewed as a stepping stone to the Supreme Court, \n     makes Mr. Estrada public enemy No. 1 to Senate Democrats.\n       That a majority of Democrats would oppose putting Mr. \n     Estrada on the bench is not surprising. That they would \n     resort to unprecedented tactics to block a Senate vote to \n     confirm him, however, is appalling overkill and partisan \n     politics at its worst.\n       Democrats have threatened to mount a filibuster to prevent \n     a floor vote they know they would lose--all 51 Republicans \n     are believed to support Mr. Estrada's nomination, as do a \n     handful of Democrats (including Georgia's Zell Miller). But \n     the number of supporters apparently falls just short of the \n     60 needed to end debate and force a vote, so Minority Leader \n     Tom Daschle is prepared to talk the nomination to death.\n       A filibuster has never been deployed against a lower-court \n     nominee in the history of the Senate. It's akin to waging \n     nuclear war over Bosnia. So why is one needed now to save the \n     republic from Miguel Estrada?\n       Democrats argue that he is a ``stealth'' candidate of whom \n     they know too little about his legal views. For example, they \n     complain that during Judiciary Committee hearings on his \n     nomination that he failed to answer questions about which \n     Supreme Court cases he disagreed with.\n       But it would be improper for a potential judge on an \n     appeals court to bias himself against cases he might hear. \n     The lower court is obligated to apply the legal precedents \n     set by the Supreme Court, whether the jurists agree or \n     disagree with them. An appeals judge who issues a ruling that \n     reflects his stated bias could be accused of conflict of \n     interest. Judges must follow the law, not their hearts.\n       Democrats also are demanding that the Bush administration \n     provide confidential papers Mr. Estrada wrote when he worked \n     in the U.S. Solicitor General's Office. The Justice \n     Department has refused on the grounds that those documents \n     are ``highly privileged.''\n       Like the filibuster, that, too, is a Democratic tactic that \n     is virtually unprecedented. Indeed, the Bush administration's \n     position is supported in a letter signed by all seven living \n     former solicitors general, who served in both Republican and \n     Democratic administrations.\n       The Democrats are upset because they haven't found a \n     ``gotcha'' moment in Mr. Estrada's testimony or scholarship \n     that would embarrass or contradict him, and thus provide them \n     ammunition to defeat his nomination. They want to continue \n     trolling further and further from shore in a desperate \n     attempt to find something, anything they can hang an \n     accusation on. Perhaps they could subpoena the list of \n     videotapes Mr. Estrada rented, as they did with Supreme Court \n     nominee Robert Bork.\n       The problem is, they've already had ample opportunities. If \n     they weren't happy with his answers at his hearing last \n     September, Democrats could have demanded another hearing. \n     They did not. Nor did they take full advantage of normal \n     procedure and submit written follow-up questions to Mr. \n     Estrada after the hearing (only two of the 10 committee \n     Democrats did so).\n       Because they lack the votes to defeat the nomination on the \n     Senate floor they have resorted to manipulating the process \n     by any means necessary--not, mind you, because they have \n     evidence to oppose him, but because they don't.\n       Is that really how Democrats want to go on record opposing \n     the first Hispanic American nominated to the influential D.C. \n     court of appeals?\n\n[[Page S2813]]\n\n       Mr. Estrada's nomination deserves an up-or-down vote in the \n     Senate, and not be held hostage by partisan parliamentary \n     games.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. ALLARD. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. Without losing my right to the floor, I yield to the \nSenator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, is the Senator aware that the two largest \nnewspapers in Colorado--the Rocky Mountain News and the Denver Post--\nhave both called for the Democrat leadership not to filibuster this \njudicial nominee?\n  Mr. HATCH. I am aware.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Is the Senator aware that the Denver Post, which endorsed \nAl Gore in the 2000 Presidential election, wrote: ``To use a filibuster \nis to impose a new requirement that judges be confirmed by a \nsupermajority''?\n  And is the Senator aware that the Rocky Mountain News wrote in an \neditorial: ``Keeping others from voting their conscience on this \nparticular matter is simply out of line''?\n  Mr. HATCH. I am aware of those editorials. And I am also aware, and I \nwant my colleagues to know, that there are more than 50 editorials \nthroughout the country expressing the same matters.\n  I hold in my hand this binder of editorials in favor of Miguel \nEstrada--just editorial after editorial after editorial, saying how \nunfair this process really is, how unfair my colleagues on the other \nside have been, how they have ignored principles of just plain common \ndecency, how they are obstructing--obstructing, in an unfair way--of \ncourse, obstruction, I guess, is always unfair--but how they have been \nobstructing this nominee. Why? Because, as the editorial writers say, \nthey do not have anything on him.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I thank the Senator from Utah for yielding.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask if the Senator from Utah will yield for a question.\n  Mr. HATCH. Without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. I think the point that has been made by the Senator from \nColorado is an appropriate one, citing the editorial from the Denver \nPost, I guess it was. And it raised a constitutional issue which is an \nissue that has not been discussed here very much.\n  Knowing that the Senator is one of the leading authorities in the \nSenate, and really in the Nation, on the issue of constitutional law, I \nwould be interested in his interpretation of article II, section 2, of \nthe Constitution, which says--and I will simply read it--\n\n       He--\n\n  Referring to the President--\n\n     shall have Power, by and with the Advice and Consent of the \n     Senate, to make Treaties, provided two-thirds of the Senators \n     present concur; and he shall nominate, and by and with the \n     Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, \n     other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the Supreme \n     Court, and all other Officers of the United States. . . . The \n     implication being that it does not take two-thirds to appoint \n     a judge but, rather, a majority.\n\n  Is that your interpretation of the Constitution? And what is the \nimplication of moving to a 60-vote majority in order to appoint a \njudge?\n  Mr. HATCH. The Senator is absolutely right. In the very same part of \nthe Constitution, it mentions that there is a supermajority vote \nrequired for treaties. By implication, the Senator is correct, advice \nand consent means a vote up and down on the Senate floor. It certainly \ndoes not mean we should have to have a supermajority vote of 60, which \nis what the Democrats are insisting upon in this body, in order to \nconfirm a circuit court of appeals nominee.\n\n  And why is the reason for that? Because the Constitution also talks \nin terms of the coequal branches of Government: the executive, the \nlegislative, and the judiciary. All are supposed to be coequal, have \ncoequal powers. If we require--because the Democrats will not end the \nfilibuster against Miguel Estrada--60 votes before we can confirm any \njudge to a position in the judiciary, that diminishes the coequal power \nand status of the President. It also diminishes the coequal power and \nstatus of the judiciary, while increasing and augmenting the power of \nthe legislative branch.\n  That is unconstitutional. And my colleagues are acting in a highly \nunconstitutional manner. And they are creating a constitutional crisis \nby refusing to end the filibuster and the obstructive tactics in this \nvery important area of Constitutional law. And I have to tell you, \nthere is a way around this, but I prefer that they end these \nobstructive tactics and that we, once and for all, decide that nobody \nis going to filibuster judicial nominees because the President does \ndeserve, through his nominating power, a vote up and down--a vote up \nand down--on these judicial nominees.\n  That is as far as I am going to go this evening. But I have to say \nthat my colleagues are asking for the world to see that the system is \nbroken. If they break the system, then no holds barred, if they break \nthe system, we have to uphold the Constitution on our side, and we are \ngoing to do it.\n  Now, all I can say is this. We have a clear majority of Senators who \nwant to see Miguel Estrada confirmed. And a minority is obstructing--\nobstructing--O-B-S-T-R-U-C-T-I-N-G--did I spell it right?--obstructing \nhim from being a judge, and obstructing us from exercising our advice \nand consent powers the Constitution provides.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. I am delighted to yield to my colleague from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to ask the Senator the following question: \nHas he not stated during the course of the day that the memoranda which \nwe are seeking, namely, memoranda prepared to the Office of the \nSolicitor General----\n  Mr. HATCH. The fishing expedition you are asking for?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Pardon me?\n  Mr. HATCH. You mean, the fishing expedition you want to have?\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator may characterize it as he chooses.\n  Mr. HATCH. I do characterize it as such.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Have you said the memoranda we are seeking in order to \nunderstand the jurisprudential philosophy of this nominee has not been \nproduced except in those instances where it has been leaked or other \ninstances where we have questions related to ethical considerations?\n  And is the Senator not aware of the fact that I am holding in my hand \na memorandum from Frank Easterbrook to the Solicitor General relative \nto the Bork nomination, produced for the Senate Judiciary Committee, \nrelating not to an ethical case but rather to a civil rights case, and \nthat it is in a category that the Senator from Utah has said, \ncategorically, this evening, has never been produced; namely, a \nrecommendation for an amicus brief participation?\n  Is the Senator from Utah aware that the very brief and memorandum \nwhich he said has never been produced was, in fact, produced to the \nSenate Judiciary Committee during the Bork nomination? And I hold a \ncopy in my hand.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I do not think the Senator knows that came from the Bork \nmatter. I don't think you can make that claim.\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is exactly where it came from.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me answer the question, and let me address some of the \nspecific examples my Democratic colleagues have represented as \nprecedent for their demand.\n  One, of course, is Frank Easterbrook, who is a judge on the Seventh \nCircuit Court of Appeals, which the Senator is raising. The Democrats' \nmere possession of a single memorandum--a 2-page amicus recommendation \nthat Mr. Easterbrook wrote as an assistant to the Solicitor General--\ndoes not suggest that the Justice Department waived any privileges or \nauthorized it to be disclosed. It did not.\n  The official record of the Easterbrook confirmation hearing contains \nno references to this document. There is nothing in the hearing that \nshows a reference to it, at least as far as I know. And I am quite sure \nabout that.\n  After comprehensively reviewing its files, the Justice Department \nconcluded that it never authorized the document's release.\n  Now, last fall, I sent a letter to Senator Schumer, and then to \nSenator Leahy, specifically asking for information about how the \nDemocrats obtained this memorandum that the Senator has been waving \nhere, with impunity, by the way. To this day, I have not received a \nresponse to my question.\n\n[[Page S2814]]\n\nThere is probably a very good reason for it because he should not have \nthat memorandum. I do not know how they got it.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. Not yet.\n  That single document provides no precedent for the Democrats' \nsweeping request for every document Mr. Estrada ever prepared on appeal \nrecommendations, certiorari recommendations, and amicus \nrecommendations.\n  Now, let me take a clear look at this. The Justice Department has no \nrecord; the hearing has no record. How is it that the Democrats have \nthat? I can guarantee you they don't have it legally--at least I think \nI can guarantee that. That is the reason why I have not received a \nreasonable response. I haven't received any response. I would think if \nthey had it legally, they would give me a response on it.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. I asked for it and, as ranking member of the committee, I \nwas entitled to it. They ignored my request.\n  The Senator made a couple other remarks I find particularly \noffensive. I will get into those other remarks later. The Senator had \nanother question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a further question?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes, without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator is taking exception to this memorandum that \nthe Solicitor General produced during the Bork nomination relating to \nan amicus. I hold in my hand a copy of the transcript of the hearings \nof the Committee on the Judiciary relating to the nomination of William \nBradford Reynolds to be Associate Attorney General of the United \nStates. And written within the committee hearings, you will find on \npage 983 a copy of a memorandum to the Solicitor General, sent by Mr. \nReynolds relating to the recommendation on an amicus brief. I ask the \nSenator from Utah, would he like to at least modify his earlier \nstatement that the Department of Justice has never produced a \nmemorandum to the Solicitor General relating to amicus briefs in light \nof the fact that it is part of the official transcript of his \ncommittee?\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me answer that question. The Senate sought and \nreceived materials in the course of pursuing specific allegations that \nMr. Reynolds, while Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights failed \nto enforce the Voting Rights Act and Civil Rights Act--as with Mr. \nCiviletti, by the way. The Department's disclosure was limited to \nspecific cases of alleged misconduct--limited.\n  The sweeping request by the Democrats in this matter is completely \ndifferent. There have been no allegations that Mr. Estrada engaged in \nany improper behavior or failed to discharge his duties. Significantly, \nalthough Mr. Reynolds previously had served as an assistant to the \nSolicitor General, the Senate never suggested--never--that his appeal, \ncertiorari, or amicus recommendations should be divulged. Never.\n  Let's just be honest here. With regard to specific allegations, if \nthe Senators have them, bring them out, instead of asking for a fishing \nexpedition into what could be thousands of documents that are \nprivileged down at the Department of Justice in the Solicitor General's \nOffice. No self-respecting Attorney General or President of the United \nStates is going to give you those documents. How you got some of these \ndocuments, I cannot say. I am not suggesting that my colleagues have \ndone wrong in getting these documents, but somebody gave them to them \nwho didn't have the authorization to do it. The Justice Department did \nnot authorize the giving of whatever documents you have. I don't care \nthat you have them. It doesn't mean anything to me, except that it is \nphony in my eyes to use them and try to say we ought to have this \nsweeping demand for maybe thousands of documents that we don't know \nwhat is in there, but we want to be able to fish through them and see \nif we can find something against Mr. Estrada.\n  I hope one of these days my Democratic colleagues will wake up and \nrealize how ridiculous they look on these arguments. These are terrible \narguments, phony arguments, if you will.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes, without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. CORNYN. The Senator from Utah is well versed in the law of \nattorney-client privilege. I believe that earlier I asked--and I am \nasking for clarification now--whether even if Mr. Estrada wanted to \nproduce the memos that the Democratic minority wishes to receive, \nwhether he has custody of those, or whether it is the client's \nprivilege to waive or not to waive, and the client--in this case, the \nDepartment of Justice--decided not to waive any claim to the privilege \nthey may have on these documents.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. Estrada said he is proud of the work he did. He would \npersonally have no real problem. He also recognizes there is a good \nreason not to give those documents based upon law and confidentiality \nand upon client-attorney work product.\n  This is the attorney for the American people. If we start giving his \ninternal documents out, he cannot function--he or she, whoever it is. \nSo, yes, I am aware of that.\n  I was interested that over the last weekend, the Senator from New \nYork, who has been very vocal in his opposition to Mr. Estrada--the \nconservative party of New York said they didn't know enough about him--\nthe same arguments the Democrats are using--by the way, this is almost \n2 years they have been examining Mr. Estrada, going through everything \nthey possibly can--Supreme Court briefs, all of his arguments, briefs \nin other cases, all kinds of other matters. They have had a full solid \nday of testimony and they asked written questions. Now they are \ncomplaining they don't know enough.\n  The conservative party of New York, as I understand it, wrote a \nletter to Senator Schumer and said: We don't know enough about you. How \nabout giving us your internal documents with regard to these matters? \nMaybe he will do that. I don't know. In all honesty, no self-respecting \nattorney who understands this--and this includes the Solicitor General \nand the Attorney General--would give up his work product that he or she \nhas been doing for clients. It would be unethical to do so. In this \nparticular case, according to seven former Solicitors General--the only \nliving ones to my knowledge--it would be a travesty to do it. It would \nundermine the very work of the Solicitor General's Office. Four of \nthose were Democrats, three of whom I think he served.\n  So these arguments are really red herring, phony arguments. I don't \nknow how they have the brazenness to keep bringing them up.\n  Mr. CORNYN. If the Senator will yield for a further question, in my \nState of Texas, as in other States that we have heard from here \ntonight, there is overwhelming editorial support for Mr. Estrada's \nnomination. Six separate newspapers have called on the Democratic \nleadership to stop this filibuster, including papers from Waco, El \nPaso, Dallas, Austin, Fort Worth, Victoria, and I believe there is \nanother one I saw from Tyler in east Texas.\n  Yet we hear that Democrats come to the floor and say, in effect, that \nnobody cares about this issue. And in the case of the senior Senator \nfrom New York, who earlier today indicated that Democrats really should \nnot pay much attention to this, or worry about paying a political price \nbecause no one is paying attention--well, I would like to tell you that \nis not true in Texas.\n  Let me ask the Senator from Utah, would he agree with me that whether \nor not people are paying attention, is that the standard we have come \nto expect from this institution and Members of the Senate when it comes \nto doing the right thing and discharging our constitutional \nresponsibilities, when it comes to advice and consent for judicial \nnominees?\n  Mr. HATCH. That is an excellent question. There is no question that \npeople are paying attention to this. I have been overwhelmed by \nHispanic concerns, just today, all over the country. They are starting \nto awaken to this. One of the Hispanic nominees--most all of them will \nsay he should not be on the court just because he is Hispanic. We would \nnot support him just for that, but he is qualified. He made the grade. \nHe ought to be treated like everybody else. He will make a great judge. \nThese are Democrats speaking,\n\n[[Page S2815]]\n\nand Independents, and Republicans speaking. But editorial writers all \nover the country are speaking as well.\n  The Senator raised the Dallas News. In an editorial entitled ``Rush \nto Judgment: Estrada nomination has been blocked too long''--we are in \nthe third week of this--let me read a paragraph or two:\n\n       Democrats by now are in full filibuster. Senate \n     proceedings, as carried on C-SPAN, resemble the film \n     Groundhog Day, where the main character has to relive the \n     same day over and over again. Every day, it's the same thing. \n     Democrats get up, march over to the podium, and shuffle \n     papers and recite their main complaint with Mr. Estrada--that \n     he is conservative, unconventional, and unapologetic. That \n     when he had the chance to hand them the rope with which to \n     hang him during his hearing before the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee, he refused to hold up his end.\n\n  I think that is pretty good. Then they say:\n\n       And so they have talked and talked, in hopes that \n     Republicans will back down. They won't. Nor should they.\n\n  I might add, in the El Paso Times, which the Senator noted--let me \nread one line in that:\n\n       Set politics aside, confirm a well-qualified nominee, and \n     work for the good of the country rather than the party.\n\n  In the Austin American Statesman, to mention three Texas newspapers:\n\n       If Democrats have something substantive to block the \n     confirmation of Miguel Estrada's confirmation to the U.S. \n     Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, it's \n     past time they share it. Estrada's nomination was announced \n     in May--\n\n  They should have said 2001, almost 2 solid years ago--\n\n     and has been held hostage since by Senate Democrats who have \n     yet to clearly articulate their objections to it.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that these three editorials be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows\n\n             [From the Dallas Morning News, Feb. 21, 2003]\n\n     Rush to Judgment: Estrada Nomination Has Been Blocked Too Long\n\n       There is a time for talking and a time for voting. The time \n     is past for the U.S. Senate to talk about Miguel Estrada's \n     nomination to the federal Court of Appeals for the District \n     of Columbia circuit. It's time to vote.\n       Having emigrated from Honduras as a teenager unable to \n     speak much English, Mr. Estrada went on to graduate magna cum \n     laude from Columbia University and Harvard Law School, to \n     clerk for a Supreme Court justice, to serve two \n     administrations in the U.S. solicitor general's office, to \n     win more than a dozen cases in the Supreme Court. In short, \n     the 42-year-old lawyer is talented. Who knew that talent \n     would extend to tying the Senate in knots for days on end.\n       Democrats by now are in full filibuster. Senate \n     proceedings, as carried on C-SPAN, resemble the film \n     Groundhog Day, where the main character; has to relive the \n     same day over and over again. Every day, it's the same thing. \n     Democrats get up, march over to the podium, shuffle papers \n     and recite their main complaint with Mr. Estrada--that he's \n     conservative, unconventional and unapologetic. That when he \n     had the chance to hand them the rope with which to hang him \n     during his hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, he \n     refused to hold up his end.\n       Democrats haven't liked Mr. Estrada from the beginning. \n     Part of that is due to his ideology--which is decidedly not \n     Democratic. But part of it also has to do with the fellow who \n     nominated him. Democrats don't relish giving President Bush \n     one more thing to brag about when he goes into Hispanic \n     neighborhoods during his re-election campaign next year. They \n     are even less interested in putting a conservative Republican \n     in line to become the first Hispanic justice on the Supreme \n     Court.\n       And so they have talked and talked, in hopes that \n     Republicans will back down. They won't. Nor should they.\n       Republicans certainly stalled their share of appointments \n     during the Clinton administration. But Democrats are being \n     shortsighted in seeking retaliation. It is precisely these \n     sorts of narrowly motivated temper tantrums--from both sides \n     of the political aisle--that turn off voters and make cynics \n     of the American people. When that happens, it doesn't matter \n     which nominees get confirmed or rejected. Everybody loses.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From the El Paso Times, Feb. 8, 2003]\n\n    Stop the Partisan Delay; Judicial Nomination Should Be Based on \n                             Qualifications\n\n       Senate Democrats, led by Minority Leader Tom Daschle from \n     South Dakota, aren't likely to be cited for obstruction of \n     justice. But that's in effect what they're doing by blocking \n     Senate confirmation of Miguel Estrada for the District of \n     Columbia-based federal appeals court. There were even hints \n     of a filibuster.\n       Playing politics to keep a well-qualified nominee from \n     being confirmed is as common as it is often destructive. And \n     it's not peculiar to Democrats; Republicans do the same \n     thing.\n       But this time it happens to be Democrats threatening to \n     block the confirmation of an eminently qualified judicial \n     nominee, keeping an important position from being filled in a \n     court system that is in dire need of qualified judges.\n       Thankfully, threats of a filibuster don't seem to have \n     universal support even among Senate Democrats. Sen. John \n     Breaux, D-La., said that Estrada is ``uniquely qualified.''\n       Democrats oppose Estrada because they believe he is too \n     conservative. Political philosophy can certainly be germane \n     when talking about politicians and political parties, but it \n     shouldn't really have any bearing on the fair administration \n     of justice.\n       As Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah and chairman of the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee, said, ``I believe (Estrada) to be \n     moderate to conservative, but I don't know. The important \n     thing is he's qualified, and he ought to be approved.''\n       That's what needs to happen now. Set politics aside, \n     confirm a well-qualified nominee, and work for the good of \n     the country rather than the party.\n                                  ____\n\n\n          [From the Austin American-Statesman, Feb. 21, 2003]\n\n        Approve Estrada Nomination or Don't--Just Get on With It\n\n       If Democrats have something substantive to block Miguel \n     Estrada's confirmation to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \n     District of Columbia, it's past time they share it. Estrada's \n     nomination was announced in May and has been held hostage \n     since by Senate Democrats who have yet to clearly articulate \n     their objections to it.\n       Those unschooled in Washington-think--that would be most of \n     us--are bewildered why Estrada, who worked in the Clinton \n     administration, is now deemed unworthy to sit on the bench. \n     So instead of clear reasons, we are treated to a sideshow \n     involving the nominee's ethnicity. Estrada was born in \n     Honduras, immigrated to the United States as a teenager and \n     graduated from Harvard Law School in 1986.\n       Democrats and their supporters hint that Estrada may not be \n     ``Hispanic enough''--whatever that means--while his \n     Republican supporters note that the nominee's opponents are \n     ``anti-Latino.'' Though vaguely amusing, the arguments have \n     nothing to do with whether Estrada has the intellectual \n     ability and temperament to become a judge on the second most \n     influential court in the nation.\n       Competence, ability and commitment to the law are what \n     should matter, but don't, in winner-take-all ideology fights. \n     In any event, Democrats appear to be the same kind of \n     ideology-driven obstructionists they accused Republicans of \n     being when President Clinton's nominees hit confirmation \n     roadblocks.\n       Though partisans may not quite see it, what is really \n     imperiled by this judicial hostage-taking is confidence in \n     the American court system. What we're seeing here is an ugly \n     legal brawl in which the participants use big words instead \n     of bottles to hit the opponents on the head.\n       Enough is enough. We don't expect the partisan brawl over \n     judicial appointments to ever end, but Estrada has clocked \n     enough time as a punching bag for Democrats. Call the vote.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, let me say more to my distinguished \ncolleague who I think has raised some pretty important issues here. It \nis absolutely astounding to me, because I have heard the same comments: \nWe Democrats are not worried about this; nobody is paying attention to \nit; we are not going to pay a political price; we do not care what we \ndo to this Hispanic man, even though he is highly qualified--and I \nheard a number of Democrats admit he is highly qualified--we are just \ngoing to do this.\n  I call them my colleagues. Look, I have used some pretty tough \nlanguage here tonight. I do not want to apologize for it because I feel \ndeeply, but I will apologize. I feel deeply about this issue. I am \nfighting for this man, as all of us Republicans are. Every one of us is \nconcerned. Every one of us wants this man to be confirmed. Every one of \nus wants to see justice here. Every one of us wants to stop the \nobstructive tactics. Every one of us wants to do what is right here. So \nif I have been too enthusiastic this evening, I apologize. I feel so \npassionate about this, so deeply about this that I can hardly stand it.\n  I have never seen, other than in Supreme Court nominations, this type \nof shabby treatment. I have never seen it before. I think I have a \nreputation for fairness around here. I think I have a reputation for \nknowing what is going on in the Judiciary Committee. I think I have a \nreputation for putting through the Clinton judges. I see this shabby \ntreatment, and I cannot help but get emotionally disturbed by it. I do \nnot know how any honest, decent person would not feel the same way.\n  I tell you, I feel like I am Hispanic. I am the chairman of the \nHispanic task\n\n[[Page S2816]]\n\nforce on our side. For 13 years I have done that, long before some \nbelieve the Hispanic people in this country were a political force. I \nhave fought for Hispanics every day I have been in the Senate. I \nparticularly resent this treatment. I particularly resent the fishing \nexpeditions where they cannot come up with one reason for even wanting \nthese privileged papers. They have not listed a specific reason. They \njust say: Let us cast our line out there and let us see what we can \nfind because we do not have anything on this man and we do not want him \non the court because he is appointed by a Republican President and he \nis a Republican himself, and he is a conservative, a Hispanic. We do \nnot want those kinds on the Federal bench.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. That, in essence, is what this argument is all about.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. Without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Is the Senator aware that on August 24, 1987, John Bolton, \nthe Republican Assistant Attorney General, wrote a letter to Chairman \nBiden, among other things saying:\n\n       Accordingly, we have decided to take this step of providing \n     the committee access to responsive materials we currently \n     possess except those privileged documents specifically \n     described. Of course, our decision to produce these documents \n     does not constitute a waiver of any future claims of \n     privilege concerning other documents the committee requests \n     or waiver of any claim over these documents with respect to \n     the entities or persons other than the Judiciary Committee.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Of course, Senator Leahy put that in the Record I believe \non February 25. Let me answer. This is a letter to Senator Thurmond.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Biden.\n  Mr. HATCH. The one I have is a letter to Senator Thurmond. I also \nhave attached to that two letters to Senator Biden. I have a number of \nletters here. I understand all of these letters the distinguished \nranking member of the committee has put in the Record.\n  I point out to the distinguished Senator from Nevada that all of \nthese letters are from the Office of Legal Counsel, not the Solicitor \nGeneral's Office. They refer to--\n  Mr. REID. But the Senator would agree the Attorney General released \nmemos from the Solicitor General's Office in this letter. That is what \nit does. That is what the letter is about. Is the Senator aware of that \npoint?\n  Mr. HATCH. These were responses to specific allegations--let me ask \nthe Senator on my time, without losing my right to the floor, is the \nSenator aware of any specific allegations justifying the request for \nthese records from the Solicitor General? Just answer my question. Are \nyou aware of any specific allegations that need to be investigated from \nthe Solicitor General's Office? If you are, I would like to know about \nit rather than have a fishing expedition trying to find something to \nmurder this guy with.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Utah made a statement on this floor this \nevening that it is illegal to release documents relating to memos in \nthe Solicitor General's Office, and the record is very clear it has \nbeen done before on more than one occasion.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, if he has a question, I will be happy to \ntake it. Gratuitous comments are not fair.\n  Mr. REID. You asked me a question, and I was answering.\n  Mr. HATCH. I will go with that. The fact is I have not said that. At \nleast I do not believe I said that. I said that these documents are not \ngiven. I said we have never given appeal recommendations and certiorari \nrecommendations that were fairly requested except in cases where there \nwere specific allegations, and then in a very limited way.\n  These letters are responding to Senator Biden's August 6 request for \ncertain additional materials referred to in the documents from the \nOffice of Legal Counsel, and I have not said that the Attorney General \nwill act illegally if the Attorney General gives up documents. I \nsuppose the Attorney General can theoretically do anything he wants to \ndo, but he will not be acting responsibly if he gives up privileged \ndocuments that should not be given up by the executive branch.\n  I suspect and said earlier theoretically I suppose the Attorney \nGeneral can do that if he wants to. He would not be responsible to do \nit under these circumstances.\n  Mr. REID. That is what Senator Durbin and I have been trying to show \nall night. It has been done in the past.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me just make another comment. Is it your desire here \nto trip me up in a multihour debate, or is it your desire to really \nfind out something about Miguel Estrada you specifically know exists? \nIf that is it, maybe I can accommodate you, I don't know. But the fact \nis, this is just a job of who got whom. I gotcha, Miguel Estrada, \nbecause I got a complaint that there may be in thousand of documents \nsomething that might destroy his nomination.\n  Am I on trial here? Is that what the Senator is doing? I will be \nhappy to say to the Senator, I do make mistakes sometimes. But let me \ntell you something. Give me a reason that really is specific why the \nJustice Department should give you access to these thousands of pages \nof privileged documents that they have never given before except in \nspecific requests and then in this case, the Office of Legal Counsel \nmatters, not the Solicitor General.\n  Come on, let's be fair here. Is there a substantive reason for all of \nthis blather on the Senate floor? Is there a substantive reason? Do we \nhave a substantive reason to obstruct this man? Do we have a \nsubstantive reason? I have not seen an argument against him since the \ndebate began other than the phony argument that he did not answer the \nquestions, which the distinguished Senator from Tennessee, Senator \nAlexander, blew away tonight.\n  I think that has been blown away by other Senators as well. My gosh, \nwhat is fair is fair.\n  Mr. REID. Could I respond to the question the Senator asked me \nwithout losing his right to the floor?\n  Mr. HATCH. I will recognize the Senator from North Carolina right \nnow--excuse me, South Carolina.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator asked me a question.\n  Mr. HATCH. I did not ask the Senator a question. Well, I suppose I \ndid, theoretically.\n  I would like the Senator to think about the answer.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who is seeking recognition?\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Will the Senator from Utah yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. HATCH. Without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, it is fair to say, like \nmany other States, this nomination has not gone unnoticed by the media \nin my State of South Carolina--I have been called worse things than \nbeing from North Carolina. Both the Spartanburg Herald Journal and Post \n& Courier of Charleston have called for an end to this filibuster, and \nthere is one aspect of the Spartanburg Herald Journal editorial I would \nlike to ask the senior Senator from Utah about, and it goes as follows:\n\n       No reasonable Congress ought to be seeking such material--\n\n  And talking about legal memorandum written by a lawyer to a client--\n\n     as a letter from all living former Solicitors General \n     attests. . . . They don't want those lawyers to be worrying \n     about how their memos will impact future attempts to win \n     judicial seats.\n\n  Does the Senator from Utah agree that if we start taking memos \nprepared by lawyers to their clients and bring those memos out in a \nfashion as to whether or not a person is qualified to serve one day in \nthe future in the judiciary that it may change work product and it will \nbe very bad for the Justice Department lawyers to have to be thinking \nabout those things? Does the Senator agree this is a road none of us \nshould want to go down?\n  Mr. HATCH. Seven former Solicitors General agree, four of whom are \nDemocrats and three of whom he served with, three of whom understand \nwhatever he did, why don't my colleagues ask them? I am sure they have \nin their quest to find some fish around here, and apparently they do \nnot have any specific reasons for asking for this huge fishing \nexpedition. But even if they did, what responsible attorney would give \nup his work product?\n  Now, let's suggest there is a Democrat President and one of our body \nis invited to be a member of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia, he decides he is sick and tired\n\n[[Page S2817]]\n\nof the Senate, mainly because of obstructive tactics like this, I am \nsure, and we, as Republicans, then say we are not going to let him \nserve until we get all of his internal memoranda while he was a \nSenator. Do my colleagues think he is going to give that up? He would \nbe nuts, because we would then be able to find all kinds of rotten fish \nin there to use against him or her. Do my colleagues see the point?\n  I hope our side would not stoop to that level, and I would fight to \nmake sure we did not stoop to that level. So I ask, where are the \nspecific allegations? They must have talked to at least their four \nDemocrat former Solicitors General and said, is there not something \nthere? By the way, those Solicitors General are for Miguel Estrada, at \nleast have said that he handled himself very well and is ethically \nresponsible, and his performance recommendations that they signed are \nthe highest form of recommendations. They have all said he has done \nthat in the highest sense of the Solicitor General's Office.\n\n  So, yes, the Senator is absolutely right. Seven former Solicitors \nGeneral, four of whom are Democrats, three of whom he worked with in \nthe Clinton administration and the Bush administration.\n  I would like to share with my colleagues an editorial cartoon which \nreally sums it up well. It shows one of two Democrat caricatures \nstating:\n\n       The makeup of the judicial system should look like America, \n     including blacks, Asians and Latinos.\n\n  Then the other asks: What about Estrada? These are two donkeys.\n  The other tellingly replies: That is different. He is not a liberal.\n  That is what this is all about. He is not a liberal. How could we \nhave the temerity to choose a Hispanic nominee for the Circuit Court of \nAppeals for the District of Columbia? How could this President do this \nsince he is not a liberal? That is what is involved.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. Without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I will ask the Senator from Utah--I \nfirst would say how effective I think he has been tonight in indicating \nthere are no reasons to oppose this nomination. I would note that the \nMobile Register in my State has a fine editorial page, and they wrote:\n\n       All precedent indicates that a filibuster against judicial \n     nominations for any reason but one concerning the nominee's \n     very integrity is essentially dirty pool.\n\n  My question is: Has this nominee's integrity ever been questioned and \ndoes the Senator agree that this filibuster is dirty pool?\n  Mr. HATCH. This nominee's integrity has never been in question. I \nthink my colleagues on the other side have acknowledged that. His \nintegrity is totally intact. He is an honest, decent, honorable man \nwho, in spite of a disability, a speech impediment, has risen to the \ntop of the legal world, who is a partner in one of the major law firms \nin this country, who has the highest rating of the American Bar \nAssociation, unanimous, well-qualified rating. This man's integrity has \nnever been called into question, to my knowledge, and I would be very \nashamed of anybody who tried to call his integrity into question.\n  I have been very passionate this evening, and I apologize to my \ncolleagues if I have offended anybody, but I have to say this is really \nimportant stuff. We cannot allow this type of treatment to go on. We \nare talking about a breakdown in the Senate, if a filibuster for the \nfirst time in history is maintained to defeat a nominee, any nominee, \nlet alone the first Hispanic ever nominated to the Circuit Court of \nAppeals for the District of Columbia. I have not wanted to antagonize \nor offend any of my colleagues, and I apologize if I have, but what I \nhave said tonight is true.\n  I have to say, I am really disturbed by the obstructive tactics that \nare being used. I would be equally upset if they were used on our side, \nbut they have not ever been used in this fashion on our side.\n  I see the majority leader is in the Chamber, but first I forgot to \nput these letters in earlier, my letter to Senators Leahy and Schumer, \nwith regard to the Easterbrook document. I ask unanimous consent that \nthey be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 1, 2002.\n     Hon. Charles E. Schumer,\n     U.S. Senate, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Schumer: Thank you for chairing last \n     Thursday's hearing on the nomination of Miguel Estrada to the \n     United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia \n     Circuit. I write to seek your clarification on a matter which \n     you raised at the hearing.\n       You reiterated your belief that the Department of Justice \n     should turn over certain appeal, certiorari and amicus \n     recommendations that Mr. Estrada authored when he served as \n     an Assistant to the Solicitor General. As precedent for this \n     request, you noted that during the nomination of Judge Frank \n     Easterbrook to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, similar \n     memos were turned over to the Committee. You produced those \n     documents and placed them into the hearing record. When \n     Republican staff requested copies of the documents, only one \n     of the three documents we received appeared to pertain to \n     Judge Easterbrook. That document consists of a two-page \n     memorandum referencing another memorandum prepared by someone \n     else.\n       At the hearing, you did not explain whether the Committee \n     had ever formally requested this document, or the other two \n     documents, from the Department of Justice, or whether the \n     Department of Justice consented to their disclosure. The \n     written record of Judge Easterbrook's hearing contains no \n     such documents, or even a mention of them. So that the record \n     of Mr. Estrada's hearing is as complete as possible, please \n     advice whether you have any information that the Committee \n     requested these documents from the Department of Justice and \n     whether the Department consented to their disclosure to the \n     Committee. If the documents were neither requested of nor \n     produced by the Department of Justice, please indicate the \n     manner in which the Committee came to possess them.\n       Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. I look \n     forward to your response.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Ranking Republican Member.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 10, 2002.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy: On October 1, I sent a letter to \n     Senator Schumer seeking clarification of questions about \n     certain documents that he submitted for the record at Miguel \n     Estrada's confirmation hearing. These documents consisted of \n     memoranda that Senator Schumer stated were provided to the \n     Committee by the Department of Justice during the nomination \n     of Judge Frank Easterbrook to the Seventh Circuit. Senator \n     Schumer cited these documents as precedent for your request \n     that the Department release to the Committee appeal, \n     certiorari and amicus recommendations that Mr. Estrada \n     authored when he served as an Assistant to the Solicitor \n     General.\n       When Republican staff requested copies of these documents, \n     however, only one of the three documents provided appeared to \n     pertain to Judge Easterbrook. That document consists of a \n     two-page memorandum referencing another memorandum prepared \n     by someone else. The written record of Judge Easterbrook's \n     hearing contains none of the three documents, or even a \n     reference to them.\n       Enclosed is a copy of my letter to Senator Schumer, which \n     seeks clarification of whether the Committee requested these \n     documents from the Department of Justice in connection with \n     Judge Easterbrook's confirmation and whether the Department \n     consented to their disclosure to the Committee. It also asks \n     for an explanation of the manner in which the Committee came \n     to possess the documents in the event that they were neither \n     requested of nor produced by the Department of Justice.\n       Yesterday, Senator Schumer's office advised my staff that \n     the full Committee provided him with the documents at issue \n     and, for this reason, he is deferring to you for a response \n     to my letter. I look forward to hearing from you, \n     particularly in light of the October 8 letter of Assistant \n     Attorney General Dan Bryant, which stated the Department's \n     conclusion that it did not authorize the release of the \n     Easterbrook memorandum.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Orrin G. Hatch,\n                                        Ranking Republican Member.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have a unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. FRIST addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. REID. I have a unanimous consent to make and ask if the majority \nleader would yield for that unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. FRIST addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader has the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Of course he does.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, as we have for the past 3 weeks, my \nRepublican\n\n[[Page S2818]]\n\ncolleagues, as we can see from the Chamber now, and I have stood ready \nto debate the Estrada nomination. Few of our Democrat colleagues have \nbeen present tonight, although we clearly stand ready to vote on this \nnomination. It appears that most of our colleagues in the minority are \nprepared neither to debate nor to vote on Miguel Estrada. Tonight my \ncolleagues have shed light on the immense reaction from newspapers all \nover the country to the obstruction of this nomination. Tonight my \ncolleagues have shed light on the fact that the peculiar and truly \nunprecedented obstruction the minority is pursuing is founded upon a \ndouble standard which is being applied to this particular nominee. \nTonight we have made clear once again that obstruction is being played \nout in the Senate by a minority that appears far from the mainstream of \nopinion throughout this country.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the vote occur on the confirmation of \nthe nomination of Miguel Estrada at midnight tonight, provided further \nthat the time between now and then be equally divided between the \nchairman and ranking member or their designees, and that at midnight \nthe Senate proceed to a vote on the confirmation of the nomination with \nno intervening action or debate.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the request \nmade by the majority leader be modified to include that the Justice \nDepartment provide the requested documents relative to Mr. Estrada's \nGovernment service, first requested in May of 2001; that the nominee \nthen appear before the Judiciary Committee to answer the questions \nwhich he failed to answer in his confirmation hearing, and any \nadditional questions that may arise from such documents.\n  Mr. FRIST. Reserving the right to object to that request for \nmodification, let me cite a sample of editorials and what they say \nabout my distinguished friend's request with regard to these memoranda. \nJust a couple.\n  From the Redding Record Searchlight in California from February 15: \nThe administration won't hand over memos he wrote when he was in the \nSolicitor General's Office, say the Senate Democrats. It apparently \ndoes not matter to them that publicizing them could rob future memos of \ntheir candor and that every former Solicitor General of either party \nhas said the Democrats seek too much.\n  Just one other from the Detroit News, February 11, 2003: Democrats \nalso demanded that he produce his memos and recommendations while he \nwas in the Solicitor General's Office, which had never been done for \nany other candidate who had been an assistant in that office. The \ndemand was rejected not only by Estrada but by every former Solicitor \nGeneral still living, including those who served Democratic Presidents.\n  I reject the request for modification.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Then I object, as well.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. FRIST. As I said, tonight my colleagues have addressed all the \nmany obstacles that have been put forward by the minority one by one by \none by one through a series of questions handled so ably by our \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, a nomination that the President of \nthe United States sent to this Senate 2 years ago. Thus, I modify my \nrequest so that each Member on the other side of the aisle would be \npermitted to speak for up to 1 hour on the nomination prior to a vote.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I again ask unanimous consent that the \nrequest made by the majority leader be modified to allow for the \ndocuments requested by the Judiciary Committee members be provided as a \npart of the hearing record and that additional questions proposed by \nJudiciary Committee members be included in the Record at that time.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in response to the motion, let me cite \nanother sample editorial. Again, it has been fascinating to watch the \neditorials over the last 2 weeks.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there an objection?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will ask for regular order. We can \ndebate this if the majority leader wishes, but this is a unanimous \nconsent request.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there an objection?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I object to the request for the \nmodification.\n  Mr. President, I have tried, as you can see, on numerous occasions to \nreach an agreement for something very simple, and that is an up-or-down \nvote on this qualified nominee. Once again, there has been an objection \nfrom the other side of the aisle. It is time to allow the Senate to \nwork its will on this nomination, the will of the Senate.\n  We are here, as you can see, ready to vote.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I was under the impression I made the objection, but of \ncourse if I did not, I do it again.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. FRIST. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll, and the \nfollowing Senators entered the Chamber and answered to their names:\n\n                           [Quorum No. 2 Ex.]\n\n     Allard\n     Bayh\n     Daschle\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Frist\n     Hutchison\n     Leahy\n     Lugar\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. A quorum is not present. The clerk will \ncall the names of absent Senators.\n  The assistant legislative clerk resumed the call of the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST.

Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is on agreeing to the motion \nof the Senator from Tennessee. The yeas and nays were ordered, and the \nclerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST.

The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, once again we were unable to reach an \nagreement on the vote for the confirmation of the nomination of Miguel \nEstrada. I want to thank all of the Members who have participated \ntonight in what is an important debate. We have had constructive debate \nthrough the evening and Members have made themselves available to vote \non the Estrada nomination. Unfortunately, given the objections from the \nother side of the aisle, we will not be allowed to vote on this \nnomination at this time. Therefore, there will be no further rollcall \nvotes tonight.\n  I know a number of my colleagues have statements they wish to make, \nand I encourage them to remain in the Chamber and continue to debate \nthis evening, even though the hour is late. I do want to notify our \ncolleagues that we will convene at noon tomorrow and will continue to \ndebate the Estrada nomination at that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, anybody who might have been watching the \ndebate this evening has to come to the realization that we are in a \nfilibuster. Personally, I am very concerned about the kind of precedent \nit is going to set for this body as we move forward in future years. I \nthink that forcing 60 votes in order to get to a vote up or down on a \njudicial nominee is a very difficult position to put this body in. I am \ndisappointed that we were not able to get a straight up-or-down vote \nthis evening on Miguel Estrada to the Court of Appeals for the District \nof Columbia.\n  I realize that watching the Senate on television is probably not the \nmost popular pastime for many Americans, but it should come as no \nsurprise to any of my colleagues or students of Congress that the \ncurrent debate and unprecedented filibuster over the confirmation of \nMiguel Estrada, President George W. Bush's nominee to the DC Circuit \nCourt, has citizens from across the country tuning in and paying close \nattention. From California to Colorado to New York and beyond, \nAmericans have closely watched the DC Circuit Court confirmation, \nbecause they realize that justice is not issued by an individual court \nor judge, but rather collectively, the integrity of the law depending \non the ability of each court to function within the whole.\n  In the midst of the Democrat-led filibuster, the Senate finds its \nbusiness completely disrupted, unable to proceed to other important \nissues such as prescription drugs and economic relief. The Constitution \ncommands that Federal judges are to be appointed with the advice and \nconsent of this body. Yet today, thanks to the obstructionist tactics \nof the Democratic leadership, we face a very real possibility of \nshifting this authority in a manner the Framers never intended, \nfundamentally altering the amount of votes required to confirm judicial \nnominations.\n\n  It is clear that the obstructionists are not interested in an up-or-\ndown\n\n[[Page S2820]]\n\nvote on this nomination. Instead, they prefer to hold the majority and \nthe American people hostage to an unacceptable game of entrenchment and \npolitics. Their reasons to prolong debate may be enough to justify a \nvote against Miguel Estrada, but I am still waiting for a reason that \nis sufficient to deny a vote entirely.\n  Television programs, talk show radio, and newspaper editorials across \nthe United States are demanding that the Democrats allow a vote on \nMiguel Estrada, that they proceed to a simple up-or-down vote.\n  The media is simply echoing the statement of an outraged public. They \nhave rejected this tyranny of the minority, and their demand for a vote \nmust be acknowledged. The call for a vote has reached the editorial \npages of both major newspapers in Colorado. The Rocky Mountain News, in \nan editorial entitled ``Democrats Turn Ugly on Estrada,'' states the \nfilibuster is irresponsible. Their editorial also undermines many of \nthe various arguments that are being used to prolong the confirmation, \nsaying the arguments that we do not know enough about Miguel Estrada is \nimplausible because he has a well-known and rather amazing life story. \nEstrada immigrated to this country from Honduras, graduated with honors \nat Columbia College, and was editor of the Law Review at Harvard Law \nSchool. Then he was a clerk to a Supreme Court Justice and argued \nbefore the Supreme Court 15 times. He received the highest possible \nrecommendation of the American Bar Association.\n  The editorial concludes:\n\n       The Democrats have no excuse . . . keeping others from \n     voting their consciences on this particular matter is simply \n     out of line.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article by the Rocky Mountain News \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Rocky Mountain News, Feb. 14, 2003]\n\n                     Democrats Turn Ugly on Estrada\n\n       Miguel Estrada is--oh--a conservative, and if that makes \n     your heart pound with fear you may very well be a U.S. Senate \n     Democrat. Then you may also be among those trying to thwart \n     the Senate's majoritarian decision-making with a filibuster.\n       It's irresponsible, this hysteria being acted out to keep \n     Estrada from serving on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \n     District of Columbia. But Democratic senators do have their \n     excuses, each more petty than the next.\n       One excuse is that they don't know enough about Estrada--\n     implausible because there's a well-known and rather amazing \n     life history here: Estrada immigrated to this country from \n     Honduras, graduated with honors at Columbia College, was \n     editor of the Law Review and Harvard Law School, a clerk to a \n     Supreme Court justice, argued before the Supreme Court 15 \n     times, and received the highest possible recommendation of \n     the American Bar Association.\n       Opponents of Estrada are piqued because he stayed true to a \n     widely endorsed tradition of refusing to indicate how as a \n     judge he might decide cases that could come before him. \n     Instead, Estrada merely said he would be an impartial judge \n     loyal to the law.\n       The Democrats have no excuse (although it's clear they fear \n     Estrada would be in line for a Supreme Court nomination if he \n     gets this other judgeship first). If liberals in the Senate \n     think conservative will spell the end of civilization if they \n     become judges, they can vote against Estrada. But keeping \n     others from voting their consciences on this particular \n     matter is simply out of line.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. The News is not the only newspaper to decry the treatment \nof the President's nominee. The Denver Post, which, by the way, \nendorsed Al Gore over George W. Bush for President, in an article \ncaptioned, ``Give Estrada His Day in Court,'' states those Senators who \nthink Estrada is too conservative should vote no. Those who think he \nwas unresponsive should vote no. The key point is there should be a \nvote. To do otherwise, to use a filibuster, is to impose a new \nrequirement that judges be confirmed by a supermajority.\n  The paper agrees the Constitution never intended such a requirement \nand that an up-or-down vote is in order.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Denver Post editorial be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Denver Post, Feb. 13, 2003]\n\n                     Give Estrada His Day in Court\n\n       Something quite unprecedented is taking place on the floor \n     of the U.S. Senate. The Democratic minority is staging a \n     filibuster against the nomination of Miguel Estrada to the \n     D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.\n       It is the first time in the history of the Senate that a \n     filibuster has been used against a circuit court nominee.\n       Under Senate rules, at least 70 senators must agree to shut \n     off debate, and the Democratic leadership says it has \n     sufficient votes to keep the Estrada nomination from being \n     voted upon.\n       Judicial nominations have always been controversial, and \n     Senate Democrats have said they harbor resentments over the \n     way Republican-controlled Senates of the past treated \n     nominees of Democratic presidents.\n       The debate on the Senate floor this time clearly indicates \n     this is more than a case of tit for tat. The acrimony in the \n     debate over Estrada suggests the Democrats think they have a \n     winning issue in opposing him on grounds that he is too much \n     of an unknown quantity, that he failed to properly answer \n     their questions and that he may just be ``too conservative'' \n     for the D.C. Circuit. They are willing to risk the criticism \n     that they are opposing a highly qualified Hispanic attorney \n     who is a picturebook example of an immigrant pursuing the \n     American Dream.\n       There is no question that Estrada is an attractive nominee. \n     His academic and legal credentials are outstanding, and \n     although he lacks judicial experience, so too did a majority \n     of those now sitting on the D.C. circuit.\n       The key issue is whether a filibuster should ever be \n     employed to defeat a judicial nominee. We think not. Those \n     senators who think Estrada is too conservative should vote \n     no. Those who think he was unresponsive should vote no. Those \n     who have a beef with the Bush administration for whatever \n     reason should vote no.\n       The key point is that there should be a vote. To do \n     otherwise, to use the filibuster, is to impose a new \n     requirement that judges be confirmed by a supermajority. The \n     Constitution has no such requirement. It simply says that \n     judges are appointed with the advice and consent of the \n     Senate. That implies an up-or-down vote. A filibuster should \n     play no part in the process.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Another article that appeared in the Denver Post was \nwritten by Al Knight, which states that if the obstructionists succeed, \nthere will only be two kinds of nominees in a Republican \nadministration: Those who can be opposed because they have said \nsomething suspect about a touchy topic, and known conservatives who \nhave not said anything inappropriate. The second category can be \nopposed, however, precisely because they have not furnished their \nopponents with a basis for opposing their nomination. The article \nconcludes that the Estrada filibuster is a lamentable departure from \nthe past.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Al Knight article be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Denver Post, Feb. 16, 2003]\n\n                   Confusing Politics With Principle\n\n                             (By Al Knight)\n\n       Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle claims he and his \n     Democratic colleagues are compelled by principle to torpedo \n     the nomination of Miguel Estrada to the D.C. Circuit Court of \n     Appeals.\n       No one who has closely followed recent events could \n     possible believe him. What has been happening in the U.S. \n     Senate is not about principle; it is about one-issue \n     politics, specifically the politics of abortion.\n       For the first time in history, a filibuster is being used \n     to stop the nomination of a circuit court judge.\n       The use of a filibuster for this purpose is especially \n     pernicious because it effectively imposes a supermajority \n     requirement on the Estrada nomination whereas the U.S. \n     Constitution requires only a simple majority.\n       Daschle and others of like mind have done everything to \n     avoid discussing this simple fact. Not one of the Democrats \n     opposing the Estrada nomination has bothered to address the \n     question of why his defeat is worth greatly politicizing \n     every future court nomination. They instead have taken to the \n     Senate floor to talk about every topic under the sun except \n     that one.\n       To the degree that a central theme has developed, it is \n     this: Miguel Estrada has failed to provide his opponents with \n     a sound basis on which to oppose his nomination. Think about \n     that! Under this method of judicial confirmation, there will \n     be only two kinds of nominees in a Republican administration: \n     those who can be opposed because they have said something \n     suspect about abortion or some other touchy topic and known \n     conservatives who have not said anything inappropriate. This \n     second category can be opposed, however, precisely because \n     they haven't furnished their opponents with a basis for \n     opposing their nomination.\n       Recent viewers of C-SPAN know just how ugly this fight has \n     become and how it may yet poison the ability of the two major \n     parties to cooperate on other matters.\n       The truth is that Estrada's great crime is he has refused \n     to worship at the altar of the Roe vs. Wade decision and has \n     simply said that he recognizes it as law.\n       That, it is now apparent, is not good enough for the \n     Democrats. Daschle has essentially said the party cannot \n     permit a\n\n[[Page S2821]]\n\n     nomination to go forward for someone who refuses to cooperate \n     in his own mugging.\n       Democrats continue to insist that there is something \n     extraordinary about the Justice Department's refusal to make \n     available a wide variety of internal memos written by Estrada \n     during his five years in the solicitor general's office. The \n     fact that all seven living solicitors general oppose the \n     release of such confidential documents seems not to matter. \n     The Democrats have seized upon this issue as though it were \n     the only lifeline available, but it is a very slim reed, \n     indeed.\n       Republicans--and at least one Democrat, John Breaux of \n     Louisiana--have said over and over again that if a Democratic \n     senator doesn't like Estrada and thinks he would be a poor \n     addition to the federal bench, the proper thing to do is to \n     vote ``no.'' The Constitution, it has been pointed out, \n     anticipates a Senate vote on all nominations.\n       The GOP, which is nowhere near as good as the Democratic \n     Party in a streetfight, is obviously hoping that it will \n     become apparent to the public over time that it has the best \n     of this argument and that the use of a filibuster to defeat a \n     judicial nominee would be a terrible precedent.\n       That hope can only be realized, however, if the American \n     public takes proper notice of this fight and recognizes what \n     is at stake. But some of the coverage it has attracted is \n     simply inaccurate. The New York Times, for example, said the \n     filibuster resembles those of the past.\n       That characterization, which makes matters sound more \n     romantic than they are, is exactly backwards. The Estrada \n     filibuster, in fact, is a lamentable departure from the past. \n     That is why this is a fight the GOP had better win.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, challenging times are at hand. While I \nbelieve a full and fair debate of Presidential nominees is of paramount \nimportance, obstructing an up-or-down vote fails the public trust and \nis a disservice to our system of justice. The Senate must resist \ntemptations to alter the basic tenets of the Constitution. Instead, the \nSenate must move forward with the business of the Nation and can start \nby voting on the nomination of Miguel Estrada.\n  Again, we ought to look at the chart and remind ourselves of the key \npoint in the editorials. The Denver Post said: The key point is that \nthere should be a vote. . . . A filibuster should play no part in the \nprocess.\n  The Rocky Mountain News says: The Democrats have no excuse for \nkeeping others from voting their consciences on this particular matter. \nIt is simply out of line.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. CRAIG). The Senator From Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I watched with great interest the debate \ntonight. Senator Hatch answered every question relating to this \nnominee. It reminds me of the times when I was a Federal prosecutor \nyears ago. You would go through a contentious trial and the defendant \nattacked the prosecutor, would attack the police, and attack the \nwitnesses. But at the end of the trial, the evidence would be clear and \nyou would have a real fine moment to stand up and challenge the \ndefendant to produce any credible evidence that would justify his \nposition.\n  Senator Hatch repeatedly challenged our colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle. He urged them and pleaded with them to state a legitimate \nbasis to reject this fine nominee, Miguel Estrada. They have failed to \ndo so. They came up with the weakest, most pitiful, sorry explanation; \nthat is, they want memorandums, every memorandum he ever wrote in the \nJustice Department.\n  That is so weak, so baseless, so wrong. That is something he cannot \ngive. It is not within his power to give. And he should not do it if he \nhad the power to do so. The memorandums he produced for the Department \nof Justice belong to the Solicitor General, to the Department of \nJustice, to the people of the United States. The United States of \nAmerica was his client. He has no ability whatsoever to produce those \ndocuments.\n  He said they can have them as far as he is concerned. But as a good \nlawyer, he knows the Department of Justice should not and must not \nproduce those documents. And they have never done that absent a \nspecific showing of a specialized need.\n  It is sad to me to see us get to this point, to see this kind of \nobstructionism. This is what we have seen. It is not fair to this \nnominee. It is not fair to the judicial system.\n\n  I call on my colleagues across the aisle, and I urge them not to make \nthis historic step, not to head down this road of filibuster. It is \nsomething we have not done before, we should not do now, and by all \nmeans we should not do this to a nominee who has not the slightest bit \nof a challenge to his integrity, not the slightest challenge to his \nlegal ability, not any objection by the American Bar Association. In \nfact, they rated him the highest possible rating they can give and \nunanimously gave him that rating. It is really a sad day.\n  If Senator Hatch was frustrated, so are a lot of us. What has been \ngoing on here is not right. It is not right. We need to stop it. The \nConstitution of the United States provides that confirmations are \nadvice and consent of the Senate, article II, section 2, by a majority \nvote. That is what it has always been. Now we are trying to convert \nthat to a supermajority of 60 votes. It is something we have not done \nbefore.\n  They say: You held up President Clinton's nominee. Let me state \nplainly, we did not unfairly hold up any nominees. We confirmed, under \nPresident Clinton's tenure as President, 377 of his nominees. One of \nthose nominees was voted down on this floor; 377 confirmed. Not once \nwas there a filibuster held. In fact, when people talked about that a \nfew times, Senator Hatch said no, that is not the right thing to do. We \nought not to filibuster. That did not occur. We went on anyway and \nconfirmed those judges. There were only 41 nominees left when President \nClinton left office of those he nominated who were not confirmed; \nwhereas when former President Bush left office there were 54 nominees \nunconfirmed by the Democratic Congress. So compared to those two \nCongresses, there is no doubt that the Republican Congress under \nSenator Hatch as chairman did a much more favorable job to President \nClinton's nominees than the Democratic Senate did to President Bush's \nnominees. That cannot be disputed.\n  It is amazing we are carrying on and suggest otherwise. Sure, the \nSenate is not a rubberstamp. Sure, it has a right to ask questions and \ndemand information that is legitimate. But they are not required and \nshould not ask for information that is not legitimate.\n  How did we get into this circumstance? How did we get to this point \nwhere the ground rules have changed, that we are into an obstructionist \ntactic, an unfair procedure? What happened? After the last election \nwhen President Bush was elected, the New York Times reported that the \nDemocrat majority, the Democratic Senators at that time early in \nPresident Bush's administration had a retreat at some location unknown \nto me, and they heard at that time from three liberal law professors, \nLawrence Tribe, Cass Sunstein, and Marcia Greenburger. These liberal \nprofessors at this private retreat told the Democrats at that time, \nthey should change the ground rules for nominations. They should \nratchet up the pressure and they should alter the historic rules of \ncourtesy, the historic presumptions in the Senate, and they should \nchange how nominees are treated. They said: You have the power to do \nit. Do it, Democrats. Stand up and block these nominees. Do not accept \nthe nominees from President Bush, like this Republican Senate accepted \nPresident Clinton's nominees. Fight every step of the way. That is \napparently what has happened.\n  Shortly after that, when the majority in the Senate changed, I served \non the Administrative Oversight and the Courts subcommittee. Senator \nSchumer chaired that subcommittee. He held hearings. He held hearings \nto argue the point that the burden of proof for a confirmation of a \njudge should change and it ought to be on the judge to prove he is \nqualified. That has never been done before in the history of this \ncountry. We had Lloyd Cutler, former Counsel to the White House of \nDemocrat Presidents. We had others testify. They testified that it \nwould be wrong to shift the burden to the nominee, it was not the right \nthing to do. Then he had hearings to say we ought to just consider your \npolitics, your ideology, as he said, and we can consider somebody's \npolitics, and we can reject them if we do not agree politically.\n  If you happen to be pro-life, you are out. Pro-life, no. No such \njudge gets confirmed here, I suppose that means. So we went through \nthose hearings. Lloyd Cutler and Boyden Gray headed up a national \ncommission that studied this and the commission rejected this \ncontention. They both said this would\n\n[[Page S2822]]\n\nnot be the right thing to do; they said no, this would politicize the \njudiciary.\n  Most of the people who serve here who are lawyers may not regularly \nhave practiced law. I had the opportunity and the honor for almost 12 \nyears to represent the United States of America as U.S. attorney, \npracticing in Federal court before Federal judges. I practiced before \nDemocratic judges. I practiced before Republican judges. It did not \nmatter to me which one it was. You presented the law and the facts \nconsistently and you would expect them to rule justly. That is what we \ntry to do.\n  We knew when we researched the law that we were going to win--we \nthought. If we had the right law, we would expect to win. Politics does \nnot enter into it. That is the ideal of American justice, that there is \nequal justice under law. It is on the Supreme Court wall here, on the \nfacade of the Supreme Court across the street, ``Equal Justice Under \nLaw.''\n  So I am really frustrated that we would suggest we ought to get into \na person's politics.\n  Of course, with regard to Estrada, to my knowledge, he never \ncampaigned for a candidate. To my knowledge, he has never run for \noffice. It appears he is a Republican and he has conservative political \nviews, but as he has explained, they do not affect his abilities and \nhis decision-making process once he puts on that robe and gets in the \ncourtroom. That is not the way he does business, and that is not the \nway a judge should do business.\n  I think we are doing something here that is quite historic and is \nvery wrong.\n  I will say one more thing before I refer to some of the comments that \nwere made earlier about Solicitor General memoranda. Remember, Miguel \nEstrada is a highly qualified nominee. He graduated magna cum laude \nfrom Columbia University after having come to this country at age 17 \nfrom Honduras. He went on to Harvard Law School. He finished at the top \nof his class there, magna cum laude, and was chosen an editor of the \nHarvard Law Review.\n  Those of us who are lawyers and those of us who know much about the \nlegal business know that being an editor of a law review at a good law \nschool is one of the highest honors a graduating senior can have. To be \nan editor of the prestigious Harvard Law Review is one of the great \nhonors any student can have.\n  After graduating from college, he clerked for a Federal appellate \njudge in the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, one of the great courts \nof appeals in America. He did that, served his tenure there. Let me \nsay, those are very competitive positions. You are not chosen to be a \nlaw clerk for a court of appeals judge or even a Federal district judge \nunless you have extraordinary ability and are perceived to be a person \npeople can get along with, pleasant to work with, and have great \nability. So he did that.\n  Remember, he is being nominated for a Federal court of appeals judge. \nHe will do the very same work on the Court of Appeals for the DC \nCircuit as he would did at the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in New \nYork, as he did there. So he has had great experience sitting at the \nright hand of a Federal circuit judge, helping him write the opinions \ndealing with the Federal issues that come before him. I think that is \nimportant.\n  After that, he became an assistant U.S. attorney in the Southern \nDistrict of New York, a very prestigious U.S. attorney's office, the \none in which Rudy Guiliani was U.S. Attorney and ran that office. By \nthe way, Rudy Guiliani has written a very vigorous editorial supporting \nMiguel Estrada.\n  He performed superbly there and was taken to the Department of \nJustice. He was asked to serve as a deputy in the Solicitor General's \nOffice of the United States Department of Justice. The Solicitor \nGeneral is often referred to as the people's lawyer. The Solicitor \nGeneral has been called the greatest lawyer's job in the world. The \nSolicitor General of the United States of America represents the United \nStates of America in court before the Supreme Court of the United \nStates of America. Most lawyers can think of no greater honor, nor can \nI, than to be able to represent the United States of America before \nAmerica's greatest Court.\n  He served there. He came in the tail end of 1992, in the Bush \nadministration, and stayed for 5 years in the Clinton administration. \nDuring that time the Clinton administration evaluated his performance. \nIn every possible evaluation, they gave him the highest possible \nrating. It was not President Bush's administration, not some other \nRepublican administration; the Clinton administration Department of \nJustice gave him the highest possible performance evaluation.\n  Then he left there and went to a great law firm, one of America's \ngreatest law firms. He has argued 15 cases before the United States \nSupreme Court. Let me tell you, I asked a lawyer earlier tonight, we \nwere sitting at a round table, and I said, How many lawyers in America \ndo you think have argued 15 cases before the Supreme Court?\n  He said, You know, I bet they could all sit at this table. I suggest \nto you, you could count on your fingers the names of the practicing \nlawyers today, in practice today, who actually have argued that many \ncases. Arguing a case before the Supreme Court is a great honor. Very \nfew people get selected. It is big time law business. Only the best are \nasked to do that. And he has done that 15 times.\n  That shows that in private practice he has the ability and the \nrespect to carry on weighty matters before the Nation's highest Court.\n  So the American Bar Association comes along. They are asked to \nevaluate this nominee, to see how well the lawyers and bar members and \nall, evaluate his performance. They talk to lawyers who have practiced \nwith him. They talk to the lawyers who have opposed him in his biggest \ncases. They talk to judges before whom he has practiced. They talk to \nlawyers for whom he has worked. And they ask people confidentially, \nalso, to express their opinion if they know of anything that affects \nhis integrity, legal ability, temperament, and those kinds of matters. \nThey take it very seriously. They particularly take a court of appeals \nnomination very seriously.\n  So they did all that for Miguel Estrada. They checked his background. \nThey probably talked to his law professors and the judges he worked for \nand lawyers he litigated against as well as with. They evaluated him, \nand 15 or so of them came together and voted, and they unanimously gave \nhim their highest possible rating. This doesn't happen to most \nnominees. Far fewer than 50 percent of the nominees for this court get \na ``well qualified'' rating. And even fewer get a unanimous vote of \n``well qualified'' by the lawyers who evaluate them.\n  So then he came before the Senate. President Bush nominated him in \nMay, 2 years ago. Quickly--by that time, the Democrats have taken back \ncontrol of the Senate when Senator Jeffords switched parties. So they \nchaired the Judiciary Committee. They refused to give him a hearing. \nThey had all his records and all his files. I am sure they were looking \nat him very closely because they heard he was a conservative Republican \nHispanic, and somebody even said, You know, he might be a good Supreme \nCourt nominee. He could be a real good nominee. Maybe we better beat \nthis guy up a little bit.\n  As a matter of fact, the more I studied his record, I saw his \ntestimony, I think he would be a great Supreme Court nominee. He has \nthe background, the academics, the integrity, the judgment, the record \nof accomplishment that would make a great Supreme Court Justice. There \nis no doubt about it in my mind.\n  Whatever the reason is, they decided to block him, so they would not \ngive him a hearing. Finally, after almost 2 years, a year and a half or \nso, they have a hearing. Remember now, they conduct the hearing. \nSenator Leahy is the chairman of the committee. Senator Schumer \npresided over the hearing. It went almost all day long. They could have \nhad 3 days worth of hearings if they chose. They got to ask any \nquestions they wanted to. He answered question after question after \nquestion. I thought he answered the questions brilliantly. I thought it \nwas interesting tonight that Lamar Alexander, Senator Alexander, went \nback and read his answers. Far from agreeing with those on the other \nside who said he did not answer the questions, he thought he answered \nthem brilliantly. He thought he answered them exactly the\n\n[[Page S2823]]\n\nway a judge should answer them. And he did.\n  I saw him do that, and he was a great witness. He does have a speech \nimpediment, but he handled it with such grace. He testified with such \nsmoothness and so much judgment and wisdom. I remember distinctly him \nbeing asked. You know President Bush said he wanted a strict \nconstructionist on the bench.\n\n  That is a layman's term for a judge who follows the law and doesn't \nmake up law--not an activist the way people talk around the country.\n  They asked Estrada: Are you a strict constructionist? He said: Well, \nI wouldn't say that. He said: I would call myself a fair \nconstructionist. I think you should give a fair meaning to the language \nof the statute and Constitution that we deal with. That is what I will \ntry to do.\n  They later asked him written questions how he would evaluate Justices \non the Supreme Court--all of them. Some of them are liberal and some \nare conservative. He said in his view they all try to be fair \nconstructionists and he respects all of them but may differ on a few \nthings but fundamentally they are in agreement.\n  So we had the hearing. He testified well. There were no complaints \nagainst him. There were suggestions that he had acted in a politically \nhostile or partisan way. There was no suggestion that he had any lack \nof integrity. In fact, his integrity has never been challenged. They \nnever challenged his legal ability or scholarship.\n  They said he didn't have enough experience. That is just \nfundamentally false. I don't see how anybody on this floor can stand up \nand say he is not qualified by background and training and experience \nto be a court of appeals judge. That is ludicrous. He has one of the \nfinest backgrounds any person I have seen for a court of appeals judge. \nHe clerked for a court of appeals judge. He clerked for Anthony Kennedy \non the Supreme Court, which I failed to mention, and he served in the \nSolicitor General's Office and the appellate division of the Attorney \nGeneral's Office of the Southern District of New York--unbelievably \ngood experience for this kind of a position.\n  So now, tonight, when we moved to go forward and end the obstruction \nand just vote, what kind of objection do we hear? Well, the objection \nwas he didn't turn over his memoranda when he was an attorney in the \nSolicitor General's Office. He wrote internal memoranda, and we want to \nsee what he said. He might have said something that we can get him on. \nSo, Mr. Estrada, you won't turn over your memos, we will not confirm \nyou.\n  Let us be truthful about this thing. They are not his memos. He has \nno authority whatsoever to turn over the Department of Justice \nmemoranda--absolutely none. The Department of Justice says these are \nwork products of the Department of Justice. Seven former Solicitors \nGeneral--three of them Democratic Solicitors General--have said they \nmust not be turned over; it is the wrong thing to do; we do not need to \nencroach on the executive branch's deliberating procedures. We don't \nneed to chill free debate in the Solicitor General's Office. They must \nnot be turned over. The Attorney General is not going to turn them \nover. So, therefore, they say: ``We gotcha.'' OK. Now we have an excuse \nnot to vote for Estrada.\n  What is the excuse? He won't turn over the memoranda? They are not \nhis to turn over. They are the Department of Justice memos. It is an \nunfair charge. He is being treated unfairly. The burden of proof is \nbeing put on him. They are accusing him of some ideological bent, but \nthey never explain what it is they are unhappy with. Not one political, \nnot one philosophical, not one theological position have I heard them \ncriticize him for. It is absolutely baseless--just absolutely wrong to \nsay he must turn over those memoranda. They are not his to turn over. \nHe can't turn them over, and the Attorney General would violate high \nstandards of ethics if he did. Oh, well, they said, you know, they \nturned them over for other people. You heard that argument.\n\n  Let me mention this first. Let us stop and slow down a minute and \ntalk about some of the people who served as Solicitor General under \nDemocratic administrations. The Solicitor General is a great lawyer \nposition, as I stated before. But also the Solicitor General must be \ncompatible with the President's philosophy and must advocate the views, \ninsofar as he is able, that the President supports. The Solicitors \nGeneral are attuned to their President.\n  Let me read what some Democratic Solicitors General said about Miguel \nEstrada.\n  Seth Waxman, former Solicitor General, Democrat, well respected \nthroughout the country said:\n\n       During the time Mr. Estrada and I worked together--\n\n  They worked together when he was Solicitor General--\n\n     he was a model of professionalism and competence.\n\n  And he added:\n\n       In no way did I ever discern that the recommendations Mr. \n     Estrada made or the analyses he propounded were colored in \n     any way by his political views.\n\n  What a compliment from a Democratic Solicitor General for whom he \nworked.\n  By the way, they want these memoranda. To whom are they written? They \nwere written to Seth Waxman, Democratic Solicitor General under \nPresident Clinton.\n  What does Mr. Waxman say, Mr. Clinton's Attorney General?\n\n       In no way did I ever discern that the recommendations Mr. \n     Estrada made or the analyses he propounded were colored in \n     any way by his personal views. During the time Mr. Estrada \n     and I worked together he was a model of professionalism and \n     competence.\n\n  I am telling you that there is no basis to object to this nominee.\n  Drew Days, another former Solicitor General under a Democratic \nadministration and an African American, he wrote in support of Mr. \nEstrada:\n\n       I think he is a superb lawyer.\n\n  When he worked for Drew Days, Mr. Days' signature was on his \nperformance reviews giving Mr. Estrada the highest possible rating each \nyear--the outstanding rating in every category on the evaluation sheet.\n  In the Department of Justice where I served, you have an evaluation \nform. Every supervisor has to fill it out and you can give them the \nrating. The highest rating is outstanding. In every category of rating \nMr. Estrada got ``outstanding'' in the Clinton Department of Justice.\n  How can this man be an extreme person, some stealth candidate out of \nthe right wing of America who can't be trusted on the bench? That is \nbogus and false and wrong. It is just unfair.\n  Robert Litt in the Department of Justice, former Deputy Assistant \nAttorney General, was considered by most people to be one of the more \npartisan members of the Department of Justice, a capable attorney, \nhowever, and certainly a Democrat. Mr. Litt said this:\n\n       I have never felt that the arguments he made were in any \n     way outside the scope of legitimate legal analysis.\n\n  Randolph Moss, former Assistant Attorney General, another Democrat:\n\n       He has a near encyclopedic knowledge of the law.\n\n  Isn't that wonderful? Think of it.\n\n       He has a near encyclopedic knowledge of the law, a powerful \n     intellect and an ability to bring coherence to even the most \n     complicated legal document.\n\n  I am telling you that is what a judge does. A judge must be able to \nbring coherence to complex legal matters to get to the heart of the \nmatter, to get it to the simplest bases and make a just decision. I \nthink that is an extremely high compliment.\n  I don't know what the Democratic Senators would look for in this \nnominee. It is beyond my comprehension how this man who is so qualified \nand with such a compelling life story would be blocked here. It really \nis stunning to me.\n  I have a lot of other things that I could say at this time. I will \nnot go into all of them. I want to make the point about the certain \nmemoranda that have been produced or have leaked out of the Department \nof Justice with regard to previous nominees.\n  Now, first, even if a prior Attorney General, at some moment of \nweakness, unwisely just produced all the memoranda and the work product \nof some nominee, that would not mean, to me, that we ought now to \ncontinue to violate an absolutely clear principle.\n  But, as I have seen the facts--and we have looked at them--not one \nAttorney General in history has responded to the\n\n[[Page S2824]]\n\nfishing expedition set forth here. This is clearly a fishing \nexpedition. They don't say there is one thing they want for a specific \nreason. What do they say? They say: We want everything you ever wrote. \nAnd it is not going to happen. It is not going to happen--nada.\n  What about Easterbrook? They said they found a two-page memo he wrote \nwhen he was in the Department of Justice. Well, the official record of \nthe Easterbrook hearing contains no reference to this document at all. \nThe Department of Justice cannot find any records they ever authorized \nreleasing this document. I am not sure how the people on the other side \ngot it. The Justice Department said they did not release it. So \nsomething is fishy about that fishing expedition.\n  As for the documents on Robert Bork, I was here, and one of my \ncolleagues across the aisle said: Oh, the documents have been given \nbefore. And he went on and on. He did not mention Judge Bork's name, \nand he waved around this document, that he was going to introduce it \ninto the Record.\n  I have been in courtrooms a little bit. He said he was going to \nintroduce it, but he never did. So I said: Are you going to introduce \nit into the Record? He said: Yes, yes, he would. So he introduced it \ninto the Record. And I went and got it. I like to read these things.\n  Well, some can still remember--I don't know if the Presiding Officer \nwas here when the Bork matter was before this body, but I think he was \nhere. He remembers some of the intensity of the debate over the Bork \nmatter.\n  He was the then-Solicitor General. You had the Attorney General and \nthe deputy, and they would not fire Archibald Cox, the special \nprosecutor. The Attorney General quit, and the Deputy Attorney General \nquit, and it fell to Robert Bork; he fired Archibald Cox on behalf of \nPresident Nixon. There were all kinds of allegations that there were \nsecret agreements and that Bork had done all kinds of corrupt things. \nAnd it was at the height of Watergate, so they demanded all kinds of \ndocuments, but they were specific.\n  Look, this is the document request. They wanted documents generated \nduring the period from 1972 through 1974--not every year he was there--\nand constituting, describing, referring or relating in whole or in part \nto the so-called Watergate affair.\n  Well, people were concerned about Watergate. They were alleging \neverybody in the Government was a crook. So Bork was in there, and he \nfired Archibald Cox. They had some specific reasons, and they got some \nof these documents. I don't think they got them all. They wanted any \ncommunications between Robert Bork and any person or entity relating in \nwhole or in part to the Office of Watergate Special Prosecution Force.\n  They wanted any documents related to the dismissal of Archibald Cox, \nthe abolition of the Office of Watergate Special Prosecution Force, and \nso on, the designation of Leon Jaworski as Watergate Special \nProsecutor, the enforcement of the subpoena at issue in Nixon v. \nSirica, and those kinds of matters.\n  So that is a specific request. At least it had some colorable basis \nbecause people were concerned about Watergate. And Mr. Bork had been in \nthe center of a very controversial decision that history records as one \nof the most controversial matters ever to come before the Department of \nJustice. So maybe they had a basis for that. And they got that. But \nthey did not ask for everything he wrote. And the Department of Justice \ndid not give it.\n\n  Well, I will just say this to my colleagues. I do not believe this \nhas been lost on my colleagues. I think they know that this request is \nunprecedented. How could they not know that? How could they not know?\n  They come and say: Well, here is a memorandum that was produced. And \nthey don't show it may have been, and was, in fact, in every instance, \na reference to a specific allegation of misconduct or wrongdoing. So \nthat is an argument without basis. It has been demonstrated by Senator \nHatch. It has been demonstrated by the facts.\n  Anybody who is fair and objective, and will listen, will know there \nis no basis whatsoever for demanding that Miguel Estrada produce these \ndocuments. And that is what the distinguished Democratic leader \nobjected on. His basis for objection was solely that Miguel Estrada \nwould not produce the memoranda he wrote while he was in the Department \nof Justice.\n  This is a big time principle. It is a major issue. It is not an itty-\nbitty thing. The Department of Justice is not going to give them, and \nMiguel Estrada has no power whatsoever to give them because they are \nnot his. They are the work product he made for his client. His client \nwas the United States of America. The United States of America is \nentitled to the best efforts of its assistants and Assistant Solicitors \nGeneral, and they ought to be able to express their opinions to their \nsupervisors, as they wish.\n  So, Mr. President, I think we have had enough time on this \nnomination. He has waited almost 2 years. The hearing was conducted by \nthe Democrats, and it was a long hearing. They followed up with further \nquestions. He has agreed to meet with any single Senator to answer any \nquestions they have.\n  He is a man of extraordinary talent, incredible achievement, a man \nwho came here, and he has lived the American dream. I am exceedingly \nproud of Miguel Estrada. I think he is indeed qualified to be on the \nSupreme Court. He ought to be confirmed for this Court of Appeals \nposition without any further debate whatsoever. And he ought to be, I \nhope, one day considered for the Supreme Court. He is certainly that \nqualified.\n  I hope we will avoid this filibuster, move forward in this Senate \nback in accordance with our traditions of comity and respect and \ncourtesy, in which nominees are presumed to be confirmable unless \nsomething is shown to be wrong, and that the President is able to move \nnominees forward, because we need them on the bench today.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, this will be a tough act \nto follow. The Senator from Alabama has done a wonderful job going \nthrough the nuances of where we find ourselves and explained the career \nof Miguel Estrada better than I could possibly do and has talked about \nthe factors that bring us here at 1:10 in the morning.\n  All I can add to it is that I am new to the body. I was hoping my \nfirst engagement with the Senate would be about Social Security and \ntalking about saving that system. But I find myself in the middle of \nsomething very historic; that is the filibustering of a circuit court \nof appeals judge--apparently, the only time in the history of our \nNation such tactics have been employed. And you ask yourself, Why? What \nhas gotten us here? Why have they chosen to do this?\n  One thing about being a Presiding Officer of the Senate is you get to \nlearn a lot and hear a lot. One thing I have learned is that in the \npast the abuses of the judicial nomination process have sometimes been \nstriking, and apparently both sides have engaged in some practices that \njust really do not seem right.\n  There are all kinds of cases where judges were never given a chance \nto be voted on and left in committee for years. And people did not like \none judge, and they decided to make sure they never got a vote. And \nthey were in the majority. It goes on and on and on. I guess that is \npolitics. I do not suggest that the Republican party, in the past, has \nnot done some things that were probably unfair to people, too.\n  But what we are about to engage in will become the mother of all \nabuses. It will take the country in a direction that it need not go in \nterms of judicial nominations. And the country, I hope, will wake up \nand listen a little closer to what we are doing over time. Editorial \nwriters are beginning to write, and they are beginning to understand \nwhat is at stake. And from a Republican point of view, it is very \nunusual to have all these papers siding with us and criticizing our \nfriends on the other side. That is normally not the case. What we are \ndoing does affect the future of the country in a very dramatic way.\n\n  A courtroom--unlike the business of politics that we all chose to \nengage in--is a place for quiet reflection. All of us here as Senators \nhave something in common. Our goal is to get 50 plus one vote, or 50 \npercent of the vote plus one. We engage in a business that is\n\n[[Page S2825]]\n\nloud, expensive, nasty, and sometimes unpleasant but very important and \nvery rewarding. Our objective, when it comes to election years, is to \nconvince people to vote for us, call attention to what we have done, to \nhow we are different from our opponent, and that we are better for your \nfamily and your business than the other person running. We have a big \ndeal made about it, and we spend a lot of money, and we beat each other \nup, and the public votes and they get to express themselves. The \nmajority wins.\n  Well, the courtroom is a different place. Our Founding Fathers \nunderstood that. There has to be someplace in a democracy where \nsomebody who feels they have been wronged by a large group has a place \nto go other than the ballot box, because the ballot box sometimes is \nnot the best place to ensure that justice is done in an individual \ncase. So in our system the weak can sue the strong. They can go to a \ncourt, be judged by a jury of their peers, and the case will be \npresided over by somebody with a lifetime appointment, who doesn't have \nany polls to worry about, or any particular constituency to please. The \nonly person to be pleased is Lady Justice.\n  The appeals process sends the case forward, and the courtroom itself, \nin terms of a trial, can be a pretty loud place, because you have \nwitnesses, and a lot of testimony, and a lot of cross-examination. It \ncan be a very flamboyant place. But whether or not that case will \nwithstand scrutiny is determined by a panel of judges at the appeals \nlevel. And there is no quieter place in our legal system than the \ncourts of appeals and the Supreme Court itself. People who are there \nfor life listen to very well-constructed arguments by lawyers, who look \nat the precedents involved in the case, look at the Constitution, and \ntry to render a fair verdict.\n  Our Founding Fathers understood that the judiciary needs to be an \nindependent, separate branch of Government, immune, as much as it can \nbe, from popular opinion, so that the unpopular may have a just \nverdict, or they may not get one otherwise.\n  Unfortunately, in this particular instance, the political trends to \nbe set, if this filibuster is successful, will do great damage to the \nprocess of trying to pick qualified men and women to serve in this \ncapacity in the future. The Constitution recognizes that the \nindependent judiciary also needs a check and balance. Our judges at the \nFederal level are nominated by the President, the executive branch, and \nthe Constitution has conferred upon this body the advise and consent \nrole, a check and balance to the executive branch.\n  The Constitution envisioned supermajority votes of the Senate in a \nvery few cases, and confirming a judge is not one of them. The \nConstitution envisions that nominees of any particular President will \ncome to this body, and the Constitution envisions that a majority vote \nwill determine the fate of that nominee.\n  The Senate rules, over time, have allowed the minority to be able to \nstop any particular matter, unless the majority can gather 60 votes. \nThat is not part of the Constitution; that is part of the way the \nSenate works. For some reason, our friends on the Democratic side have \nchosen to filibuster a circuit court of appeals nominee for the first \ntime in the history of our country. They have chosen Miguel Estrada for \nsome reason. Well, I am not privy to their caucus conversations, but I \nhave a feeling this goes back to last year's election. The Republican \nparty picked up seats in last year's senatorial election that even we \ncould not have envisioned as a party 2 years ago. Something happened in \nthe 2002 election that allowed us to get 51 seats.\n\n  For every Member of the body, there is probably a different opinion \nas to what did happen in 2002. I argue to my friends on the other side \nthat 100 years from now people will not write much about the 2002 \nelection; they really won't care to know why Lindsey Graham got elected \nwith nine other Republican freshman Senators. Unless I can do the \nSenator Thurmond thing, I will be long gone myself. But they will care \nand they will write about what happened to our country if we filibuster \ncontroversial judicial nominees as a matter of political practice. That \nwill have taken us down a road that no one, so far, has gone down.\n  I am afraid that road would be a very unpleasant journey for our \nNation. I think our friends on the other side of the aisle lost seats \nin 2002 because we had a popular Republican President, serving right \nafter one of the most horrific events of our time--the tragedy of 9/\n11--a President Americans liked and trusted to make hard decisions. He \nwas able to make the case to enough American voters in the 2002 \nelection that the Senate in the hands of our Democratic colleagues was \nnot producing in an appropriate fashion.\n  Now, I know people will disagree with that analysis, but that is what \nI believe. In my campaign, we talked about a homeland security bill \nthat was held up because of special interest labor union politics. We \ntalked about an antiterrorism insurance bill that would allow people to \nbuild buildings without having to absorb the risk of a terrorist attack \nby themselves because of legal provisions that trial lawyers wanted.\n  Also, we talked about judges who could not get a vote on the Senate \nfloor. I am convinced that resonated, that after 9/11 people wanted us \nto work together and, rightly or wrongly, enough people in the country \nbelieved the Democratic-controlled Senate was not working as an \nefficient body and helping a President the public liked and wanted to \nbe successful.\n  Right after the election in November, we had a special election in \nLouisiana in December. Our friends on the other side of the aisle were \nable to hold a seat. I argue that the momentum of the 2002 election was \na moment in time, and that those in the Democratic Party who believe \nthey must stand up to George W. Bush at every turn and take him on \npersonally with every agenda he has control of must understand there is \na limit to that strategy. The limit to that strategy has to be the \ncommon good. I argue that we have gone into an area where the common \ngood is not being served. That the filibustering of Miguel Estrada's \nnomination to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals is not only \nunprecedented, I believe it is part of an overall strategy. I believe--\nand I hope I am wrong--that we will see this happen time and again this \nyear; that this is part of a strategy by our friends on the other side \nto further obstruct the ability of the President to move judicial \nnominees through the system.\n\n  By employing this tactic, they have set a course that will be hard to \nturn. Politics being what it is, people have long memories, and there \nwill come a day when a Democrat will occupy the White House and the \nRepublican Party will be in the minority in the Senate, and it will be \ntalked about: Remember what they did to Miguel Estrada.\n  There is a certain part of politics that appeals to our basic \ninstincts, not the common good, and I hope, and I literally pray, that \nour friends on the other side of the aisle will find a different tactic \nto take to make their points of view known about President Bush's \nagenda, including judges, rather than engaging in a tactic that will \nbasically supplant the constitutional role of confirming judges by \nrequiring Senates of the future to have to gather 60 votes to confirm a \ncontroversial judicial nominee.\n  This tactic will hurt us all. This tactic will belittle and demean \nthe judicial nomination process. This tactic will change the \nconstitutional process we have lived with for well over 200 years in \nconfirming judges. This tactic will allow a bitter minority of the \ngreatest body in democratic history to act in a way that will make it \nvery hard for good men and women to serve. And that bitter minority one \nday may be a Republican minority.\n  I hope that reason will prevail; that we can reach a compromise of \nsome sort that will allow everybody to walk away from this in good \nfaith and say they fought the good fight and that Miguel Estrada will \nhave a vote up or down, and that this tactic of filibustering, \nrequiring a supermajority vote for judicial nominees, will give way for \nthe sake of the common good.\n  It has been amazing to me to see the transformation of the arguments \nagainst Miguel Estrada and how they have changed over time. Being a \nmember of the Judiciary Committee, I can recall being shocked by \nhearing the phrase from someone--and I cannot remember who--``he's not \nHispanic\n\n[[Page S2826]]\n\nenough.'' Obviously, I am not Hispanic, and I do not know what being \n``Hispanic enough'' means. It was a phrase that just really did not \nsound nice, was not befitting of the experience we are all in, and was \nused to explain the fact that Miguel Estrada, by going to a private \nschool, somehow did not share the Hispanic experience. That sounded \noffensive, and it was offensive. Nobody says it anymore, and that is \nthe good news.\n  When the Hispanic groups that came out against Mr. Estrada's \nnomination first rallied around this cause, they were pretty hard on \nhim as a person. Once one understands who he is and what he has gone \nthrough, it really is unfair to be hard on him as a person because he \nis a good person and he has overcome obstacles that everybody should be \nproud of, that I could only imagine.\n  He truly has lived the American dream. He made something of himself \nin the most difficult of circumstances. We do not hear much about that \nanymore. As a matter of fact, we hear from our friends on the other \nside of the aisle that this has nothing to do with his ethnic \nbackground. Good. Because it should not. It should be about who is \nqualified. We should enjoy and relish the fact that diversity is part \nof the American dream, and that for the first time, we will have a \nHispanic member on the Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of \nColumbia, the second highest court in the land. That would be a good \nthing for America, and we should rejoice in it if it does happen.\n\n  Then the attacks moved to a different level: He has never been a \njudge. When I first heard that, it made me wonder. To be on the circuit \ncourt of appeals, maybe it is a good thing to be a judge before you get \npromoted. Then I learned that Justice Rehnquist and untold numbers of \nmen and women serving in the Federal judiciary were promoted to very \nimportant positions without ever having any previous judicial \nexperience, which makes sense because being a judge is a cocktail of \nseveral items: Temperament, intellect, the ability to understand human \nbehavior, the ability to reason and to have a kind and compassionate \ndisposition. That is what I am looking for, and people can bring those \nqualities to the table without ever having worn a robe.\n  That argument, that he has never been a judge, fell by the wayside \nwhen the untold numbers of judges who never had any experience before \ncame forward. So he is like so many others. It makes no sense to say no \nbecause of that.\n  The next argument is he is ideologically driven; that there is \nsomething about this man that would not allow him to look at my case or \nyour case or anyone else's case fairly because he is so driven by his \nideology that he cannot see justice, that he cannot see facts, and he \ncannot see prior decisions. I am assuming this ideology is one of some \nextreme view of the law that only a radical conservative could have; \nthat he is ideologically not equipped to serve in such an important \njob.\n  That has to be analyzed in terms of the man's life. It is easy to say \nsomething, but it should be a requirement that it be true. I will just \noffer one fact for people to consider. If he is so ideologically driven \nthat he cannot fairly render justice, how in the world could he have \nworked for the Bill Clinton administration? I would argue that any \nideologically driven conservative would have had a hard time working \nfor Bill Clinton. Not only did Miguel Estrada work in the Clinton \nadministration's Justice Department, he performed in an outstanding \nmanner.\n  One of the gentlemen who accused him of being ideologically driven \nhappened to be the person who rated his performance, and during the \nreporting periods involved, he said he was an outstanding lawyer who \nalways applied the law and the facts based on reason and not personal \nagendas.\n  The idea that Miguel Estrada is some right-wing ideologue makes \nabsolutely no sense, and he is being supported by the people who know \nhim the best--by Democrats and Republicans who understand that he is a \nman of great credentials. I will assure my colleagues of one thing, if \nyou do not believe anything else I have said, that the American Bar \nAssociation is never going to unanimously support somebody who is an \nideologue on the conservative side, and he received a most highly \ncoveted rating, well qualified, by the American Bar Association. That \nargument that he is an ideologue that cannot see reason is stupid.\n\n  The next one is: We do not know enough about him and the only way we \nare only going to know about him is for us, our friends on the other \nside, to have access to all the memoranda he has ever written as a \nlawyer when he worked for the Department of Justice.\n  There is a reason that all the Solicitors General have come out \nunanimously against the idea of producing legal memorandum in that \nDepartment to the Congress. Nobody would want the lawyers who worked \nfor them, who advise them with written or oral opinions, to have that \nwork product disclosed to the public in a fashion that would change \npeople's opinions and change the way they would advise. If it ever \nbecomes the law of the land, if this case results in internal memos \nwritten by lawyers to clients, if that becomes part of how a judge is \nchosen, then I would argue that Government lawyers who have any \naspirations of being a judge are going to find themselves in a very \ndifficult circumstance.\n  There is a reason that every Solicitor General living today has said \nthat the memos requested by our friends on the other side should not be \nreleased. What I find most astonishing is that the last administration, \nand some who know me understand that I was probably not their biggest \nfan, time and time again used privilege after privilege, mostly made \nup, to protect everything they touched. I thought they abused the \nprivilege doctrines, but here is something we should all be able to \nagree upon: That when a lawyer writes a memo to a client, that should \nstay between the client and the lawyer. And if the client does not want \nthe memo released, for the good of us all, for the sake of the \nattorney-client privilege, for the sake of good government, that \nrequest should be denied. We do not know enough about him because we \nreally have not had a chance to talk to him.\n  I was in the Judiciary Committee. The man was there all day. There is \na volume that was produced from the hearings. He has been around for a \nyear and a half. He has answered questions. I think he has given good \nanswers. This is not about not knowing enough about him, not being able \nto answer the questions that were not properly asked, because the \npeople who want this information are going to vote no anyway.\n  This is about conservative versus liberal. This is about politics. \nThis is about trying to rectify the losses in 2002. I am convinced that \nour friends on the other side of the aisle have decided that the only \nway they can get back into the game is to oppose President Bush. \nInstead of learning from the 2002 elections that obstruction was not \nthe way to a majority, I think they have blinders on now in that they \nhave engaged in a political dynamic that not only will not allow them \nto regain the majority of this body but could do irreparable damage to \nour country in the future.\n  I know that each and every one of them believes that there is a high \npurpose for what they are doing; they love their country as much as I \ndo and would disagree with my assessment. But this I am sure of: if \nthis filibuster is successful, 100 years from now we will have changed \nthe way business is done in the Senate in regard to confirming \ncontroversial judicial nominees. And 100 years from now, people, if \nthey could, would come back to each and every one of us and say: Why \ndid you do that? I wish you would have not done that. We are paying a \nprice for your desire to get a political advantage that you could not \neven envision.\n  I am hopeful that over time there will be Members on the other side \nof the aisle sufficient enough in number who will say: I will not \nengage in this practice to the point that I am legitimizing a \nfilibuster of a circuit court nominee that will set in motion forces of \nthe future that will change the way the Constitution works.\n  I am hopeful we will eventually get enough votes not to confirm \nMiguel Estrada but to allow a vote to be had to confirm Miguel Estrada. \nIf that vote is had, he will win, I am convinced. For the sake of the \nfuture of this country, I hope that some time in the near future this \ntempting practice of making\n\n[[Page S2827]]\n\nit hard for President Bush to get forward any judicial nominee our \nfriends on the other side do not like will be abandoned because I am \nconvinced they will look back in their political career with great \nregret that they ever did this.\n  Several of them are on record of having said in the past, just give \nhim a vote. I will never engage in a filibuster of a judge because I \nthink it is wrong, I think it is bad for the country. When Senator \nLeahy said it, he was right. When Senator Kennedy said it, he was \nright. When Senator Feinstein said it, she was right. At the time they \nsaw very clearly the consequences of what could happen.\n  We are too close to the 2002 election for some of our friends on the \nother side of the aisle to see clearly. All they see is a majority lost \nand a real desire to get it back. Please reflect, please do not be \nblinded by the political moment. Please do not take our country down a \nroad that we will all regret.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to explain again my reasons for \nsupporting a filibuster on the nomination of Miguel Estrada. At the \noutset, let me state that my opposition to bring his nomination to a \nvote is not a decision I have reached causally or without serious \nreflection. Our power to extend debate on a nomination should only be \nundertaken in extraordinary circumstances, when we have no other \nchoice. We have reached that unfortunate state of affairs today.\n  In the case of Mr. Estrada, we are presented with a nominee for a \nlifetime appointment to our Nation's second most powerful court. This \nnominee has refused to answer our questions regarding his views and \njudicial philosophy, and indeed has obstructed our efforts to evaluate \nhis fitness to serve on the D.C. Circuit. His repeated evasions subvert \nour solemn constitutional duty to advise and consent to judicial \nnominations. We should not permit a vote on a judicial nominee who has \nso fundamentally attempted to obstruct our confirmation process in this \nway.\n  I am aware of the criticism that our action is unprecedented. This is \nsimply not true. While such a step is not--and should not--be done \nroutinely, filibusters of judicial nominations have been undertaken \nunder the leadership of both parties several times in recent years. \nAccording to the Congressional Research Service, the Senate has \nattempted to invoke cloture in response to extended debate on judicial \nnominees 13 times since 1968. Indeed, cloture was sought after extended \ndebate in response to Republican-led opposition to no fewer than four \nof President Clinton's judicial nominees.\n  These statistics do not take into account the silent filibuster known \nas a ``hold''--often anonymous--which permits one objector to block \nconsideration of a judicial nominee. President Clinton's nominees were \nroutinely defeated by anonymous holds. And those holds only defeated \nthe nominees who were lucky enough to even get a hearing and a \ncommittee vote. It seems that the same forces complaining about the \n``unfairness'' of extended debate on the Estrada nomination were \nenthusiastic in blocking President Clinton's nominees without any \ndebate just a few short years ago.\n  I also am distressed at the false and misleading charges and \naccusations that Mr. Estrada's supporters have leveled during this \ndebate. The most outrageous is the cynical charge that our opposition \nto Mr. Estrada is somehow motivated by the fact that he is Hispanic. \nNothing could be further from the truth. Our opposition to him is \nsolely based on his consistent obstruction of our review of his \nnomination and his unwillingness to provide us with the information \nneeded to evaluate his fitness.\n  No observer can doubt that we support and indeed make diversity a \npriority in our courts, including appointing Hispanic Americans to fill \nthese positions. And let's remember that the confirmation of at least \nthree highly qualified appellate court nominees of Hispanic origin \nnominated by President Clinton--two for the Fifth Circuit and one for \nthe Ninth Circuit--were blocked by the same people who complain today \nabout our opposition to Mr. Estrada. One thing is perfectly clear: This \nnomination has nothing to do with ethnicity and everything to do with \nduplicity.\n  When Mr. Estrada refuses to candidly share his views with us, we are \nleft with his record. And this record leaves us with grave concerns \nabout confirming him to this crucial judgeship. A few examples from Mr. \nEstrada's career highlight these concerns. Mr. Estrada devoted \nsubstantial time and energy to defending, on behalf of pro bono \nclients, anti-loitering statutes, laws which often result in the \narrests of a disproportionate number of African-Americans and Latinos. \nThese laws have been repeatedly struck down for violating free speech \nrights. On the other hand, Mr. Estrada has argued on behalf of the \nFirst Amendment rights of a large pharmaceutical company charged with \nengaging in a deceptive advertising campaign. These two cases make it \nappear that Mr. Estrada is more comfortable with asserting the First \nAmendments rights of giant corporations than average citizens. He has \nalso argued in Federal court against the standing of civil rights \norganizations to vindicate the constitutional rights of their members.\n  When one reviews Mr. Estrada's professional record, then, there \nappears to be little to rebut the opinion offered by Paul Bender, his \nsupervisor for three years at the Solicitor General's office, that Mr. \nEstrada is a ``right-wing ideologue'' who ``lacks [the] judgment . . . \nto be an appeals court judge.'' This view, from the one person at the \nSolicitor General's office who knew his work best, is damning.\n  Of course, if we had access to Mr. Estrada's memorandums and opinions \nat the Solicitor General's office, we could evaluate for ourselves \nwhether Mr. Bender's opinion is unduly harsh or not. But we do not have \nsuch access. If Mr. Estrada was willing to candidly discuss his views \nand judicial philosophy with us, our concerns about whether he was \noutside the mainstream might be assuaged. But this he is also not \nwilling to do so. We have no choice but to rely on his record, and this \nrecord convinces us that he does not warrant confirmation to the D.C. \nCircuit.\n  Anyone who reviews my record on judicial nominations knows that I \nhave not reached my decision to support extended debate here--indeed my \ndecision to oppose Mr. Estrada's confirmation--lightly. In my entire 14 \nyears in the Senate, I have voted to oppose the confirmation of \njudicial nominations only seven times. But this nominee's evasions and \ngross disrespect for our nomination process, when combined with the \ndisturbing evidence from his public record of his extreme ideology, \nleave me no choice.\n  One of the most important tasks we perform is our constitutional duty \nto ``advise and consent'' on judicial nominations. Once their \nnominations are confirmed by the Senate, these men and women serve \nlifetime appointments, unanswerable to Congress, the President, or the \npeople. They will become the guardians of our liberties, of our \nConstitution, and of our civil rights. Our duty to ``advise and \nconsent'' is the only check we will ever have on the qualifications and \nfitness of those chosen to serve as Federal judges.\n  When a nominee subverts and impedes this vital process by declining \nto answer our questions so that we cannot evaluate his fitness to \nserve, he has disqualified himself for consideration by this body. We \nsimply cannot vote up or down on a nominee who both has no judicial \nrecord and refused to provide us with the information necessary for us \nto gain even the most basic understanding of his opinions, his outlook, \nor judicial philosophy. For these reasons, I oppose his confirmation.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina). Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, as majority leader, I have not taken the \nopportunity today to discuss the nomination of Miguel Estrada, although \nI did have the opportunity to participate in the debate and the \ndiscussion that we had earlier this evening.\n  Of course it always on my mind, because the filibuster that is being \nmaintained is very troubling.\n  Well, I wanted to find some time and it is now 1:45 in the morning \nhere in\n\n[[Page S2828]]\n\nWashington, and this time works for me.\n  As we have heard tonight, the leading obstacle to Miguel Estrada's \nconfirmation are unprecedented requests by the minority of documents \nwritten by Mr. Estrada when he worked for the Clinton Reno Justice \nDepartment.\n  Well, since we have time, I would like to read at length from a \nletter just released, this will be the first time anyone has heard this \nletter to my colleague the Senator from New York from Alberto Gonzales, \nPresident Bush's White House Counsel, and like Miguel Estrada, a fine \nlegal mind.\n  The letter is dated February 24, 2003, and it begins:\n\n       Dear Senator Schumer: Based on your public comments \n     yesterday, I am concerned that you may have inaccurate and \n     incomplete information about Miguel Estrada's qualifications \n     and about the historical practice with respect to judicial \n     confirmations. Therefore, I write to respectfully reiterate \n     and explain our conclusion that you and certain other \n     Senators are applying an unfair double standard--indeed, a \n     series of unfair double standards--to Miguel Estrada.\n       First, your request for confidential attorney-client \n     memoranda Mr. Estrada wrote in the Office of Solicitor \n     General seeks information that, based on our review, has not \n     been demanded from past nominees to the federal courts of \n     appeals. We are informed that the Senate has not requested \n     memoranda such as these for any of the 67 appeals court \n     nominees since 1977 who had previously worked in the Justice \n     Department--including the seven nominees who had previously \n     worked in the Solicitor General's office.\n       Nor have such memoranda been demanded from nominees in \n     similar attorney-client situations: The Senate has not \n     demanded confidential memoranda written by judicial nominees \n     who had served as Senate lawyers, such as memoranda written \n     by Stephen Breyer as a Senate counsel before Justice Breyer \n     was confirmed to the First Circuit in 1980. Nor has the \n     Senate demanded confidential memoranda written by judicial \n     nominees who had served as law clerks to Supreme Court \n     Justices or other federal or state judges. Nor has the Senate \n     demanded confidential memoranda written by judicial nominees \n     who had worked for private clients.\n       The very few isolated examples you have cited were not \n     nominees for federal appeals courts. Moreover, those \n     situations involved Executive Branch accommodations of \n     targeted requests for particular documents about specific \n     issues that were primarily related to allegations of \n     malfeasance or misconduct in a federal office. We \n     respectfully do not believe these examples support your \n     request. Our conclusion about the general lack of support and \n     precedent for your position is buttressed by the fact that \n     every living former Solicitor General (four Democrats and \n     three Republicans) has strongly opposed your request and \n     stated that it would sacrifice and compromise the ability of \n     the Justice Department to effectively represent the United \n     States in court. In short, the traditional practice of the \n     Senate and the Executive Branch with respect to federal \n     appeals court nominations stands in contrast to your request \n     here and supports our conclusion that an unfair double \n     standard is being applied to Miguel Estrada. (Also, contrary \n     to your suggestion yesterday, please note that no one in the \n     Executive Branch has reviewed these memoranda since President \n     Bush took office in January 2001.)\n       Second, you suggested that ``no judicial nominee that I'm \n     aware of, for such a high court, has ever had so little of a \n     record.'' I respectfully disagree. Miguel Estrada has been a \n     very accomplished lawyer, trying cases before federal juries, \n     briefing and arguing numerous appeals before federal and \n     state appeals courts, and arguing 15 cases before the Supreme \n     Court, among his other significant work. His record and \n     breadth of experience exceeds that of many judicial nominees, \n     which is no doubt why the American Bar Association--which you \n     have labeled the ``gold standard''--unanimously rated him \n     ``well-qualified.'' In noting yesterday that Mr. Estrada's \n     career had been devoted to ``arguing for a client,'' you \n     appeared to imply that only those with prior judicial \n     service (or perhaps ``a lot of [law review] articles'') \n     may serve on the federal appeals courts. But five of the \n     eight judges currently serving on the D.C. Circuit had no \n     prior judicial service at the time of their appointments. \n     Indeed, Supreme Court Justices Rehnquist, White, and \n     Powell--to name three of the most recent--had not served \n     as judges before being confirmed to the Supreme Court. And \n     like Mr. Estrada, two appointees of President Clinton to \n     the D.C. Circuit (Judge David Tatel and Judge Merrick \n     Garland) had similarly spent their careers ``arguing for a \n     client,'' but were nonetheless confirmed.\n       Now the letter goes on to quote from the Chief Justice:\n       As the Chief Justice noted in his 2001 Year-End Report, \n     moreover, ``[t]he federal Judiciary has traditionally drawn \n     from a wide diversity of professional backgrounds.'' The \n     Chief Justice cited Justice Louis Brandeis, Justice John \n     Harlan, Justice Byron White, Judge Thurgood Marshall (as \n     nominee to the Second Circuit), Judge Learned Hand, and Judge \n     John Minor Wisdom as just a few examples of great judges who \n     had spent virtually their entire careers ``arguing for a \n     client'' before becoming Supreme Court Justices or federal \n     appeals court judges.\n\n       As these examples show, had the ``arguing for a client'' \n     standard been applied in the past, it would have deprived the \n     American people of many of our most notable appellate judges. \n     Based on our understanding, this standard has not been \n     applied in the past. This further explains why we have \n     concluded that an unfair double standard is being applied to \n     Miguel Estrada.\n       Third, you stated that ``when you went to those hearings, \n     Mr. Estrada answered no questions.'' The record demonstrates \n     otherwise. Mr. Estrada answered more than 100 questions at \n     his hearing, and another 25 in follow-up written answers. He \n     explained in some detail his approach to judging on many \n     issues, and did so appropriately without providing his \n     personal views on specific legal or policy questions that \n     could come before him--which is how previous judicial \n     nominees of Presidents of both parties have appropriately \n     answered questions. Indeed, at his hearing, Mr. Estrada was \n     asked and answered more questions, and did so more fully, \n     than did President Clinton's appointees to this same court. \n     Judge David Tatel was asked a total of three questions at his \n     hearing. Judges Judith Rogers and Merrick Garland were each \n     asked fewer than 20 questions. The three appointees of \n     President Clinton combined thus answered fewer than half the \n     number of questions at their hearings that Mr. Estrada \n     answered at his hearing.\n       What is more, like Mr. Estrada, both Judge Rogers and Judge \n     Garland declined to give their personal views on disputed \n     legal and policy questions at the hearing. Judge Rogers \n     refused to give her views when asked about the notion of an \n     evolving Constitution. And Mr. Garland did not answer \n     questions about his personal views on the death penalty, \n     stating that he would follow precedent. In short, we believe \n     that your criticism of Mr. Estrada's answers at his hearing \n     reveals that another unfair double standard is being applied \n     to Mr. Estrada.\n       Fourth, you stated that the Founding Fathers ``came to the \n     conclusion that the Senate ought to ask a whole lot of \n     questions'' of judicial nominees. We respect the Senate's \n     constitutional role in the confirmation process, and we agree \n     that the Senate should make an informed judgment consistent \n     with its traditional role and practices. But your \n     characterization of the Senate's role with respect to \n     judicial nominations is not consistent with our reading of \n     historical or traditional practice.\n       Alexander Hamilton explained that the purpose of Senate \n     confirmation is to prevent appointment of ``unfit characters \n     from State prejudice, from family connection, from personal \n     attachment, or from a view to popularity.'' The Federalist \n     76. The Framers anticipated that the Senate's approval would \n     not often be refused unless there were ``special and strong \n     reasons for the refusal.'' Id. Moreover, the Senate did not \n     hold hearings on judicial nominees for much of American \n     history, and the hearings for lower-court nominees in modern \n     times traditionally have not included the examination of \n     personal views that you have advocated. (My letter of \n     February 12, 2003, to Senators Daschle and Leahy contains \n     more detail on this point.) Indeed, just a few years ago, \n     Senator Biden made clear, consistent with the traditional \n     practice, that he would vote to confirm an appeals court \n     judge if he were convinced that the nominee would follow \n     precedent and otherwise was of high ability and integrity.\n       In short, it appears that you are seeking to change the \n     Senate's traditional standard for assessing judicial \n     nominees. We respect your right to advocate a change, but we \n     do not believe that the standard you seek to apply is \n     consistent with the Framers' vision, the traditional Senate \n     practice, or the Senate's treatment of President Clinton's \n     nominees. Rather, we believe a new standard is being devised \n     and applied to Miguel Estrada.\n       Fifth, you stated yesterday that a ``filibuster'' is not an \n     appropriate term to describe what has been occurring in the \n     Senate. We respectfully disagree. Democrat Senators have \n     objected to unanimous consent motions to schedule a vote, and \n     they have indicated that they will continue to do so. That \n     tactic is historically and commonly known as a filibuster, \n     and is a dramatic escalation of the tactics used to oppose \n     judicial nominees. Indeed, in 1998, Senator Leahy stated:\n       I have stated over and over again on this floor that I \n     would refuse to put an anonymous hold on any judge; that I \n     would object and fight against any filibuster on a judge, \n     whether it is somebody I opposed or supported; that I felt \n     the Senate should do its duty. If we don't like somebody the \n     President nominates, vote him or her down. But don't hold \n     them in this anonymous unconscionable limbo, because in doing \n     that, the minority of Senators really shame all Senators.'' \n     144 Cong. Rec. S6522 (June 18, 1998). In\n\n[[Page S2829]]\n\n     our judgment, the tactics now being employed again show that \n     Miguel Estrada is receiving differential treatment.\n       Now Judge Gonzales Concludes this way, addressing himself \n     to Senator Schumer:\n       As I have said before, I appreciate and respect the \n     Senate's constitutional role in the confirmation process. You \n     have expressed concern that you do not know enough about Mr. \n     Estrada's views, but you have not submitted any follow-up \n     questions to him. We respectfully submit that the Senate has \n     ample information and has had more than enough time to \n     consider questions about the qualifications and suitability \n     of a nominee submitted more than 21 months ago. Most \n     important, we believe that a majority of Senators have now \n     concluded that they possess sufficient information on Mr. \n     Estrada and would vote to confirm him. We believe it is past \n     time for the Senate to vote on this nominee, and we urge your \n     support.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Alberto R. Gonzales\n                                          Counsel to the President\n\n  Now as we heard earlier an enormous number of editorials, over 60 \neditorials all over the country have opposed the Democrat filibuster \nand support Miguel Estrada. Only eight have taken the Democrat view of \nthings--only eight.\n  It is clear to anyone that what the minority is doing in \nfilibustering Miguel Estrada's nomination is far from the mainstream of \nwhat thoughtful people are thinking across this country.\n  Mr. President, I will read from just a few of these:\n  First, on the question of the Solicitor General memos:\n  Boston Herald, 2/14/03:\n\n       The latest [bad argument] has to do with the White House's \n     refusal to release memos and documents written by Estrada \n     during his tenure in the solicitor general's office. Now all \n     of the living former solicitors general--four Democrats and \n     three Republicans--happen to agree with the White House \n     position. There is such a thing as attorney-client privilege, \n     even for the solicitor general.\n\n  South Carolina's Spartenburg Herald Journal, 2/14/03:\n\n       The administration refused to turn over his Justice \n     Department memos--though no reasonable Congress ought to be \n     seeking such material, as a letter from all living former \n     solicitors general attests. They have asked the White House \n     to release internal legal memos he wrote while working for \n     the Solicitor General's Office. These are documents that are \n     usually kept within the White House. In fact, every living \n     former solicitor general, four Democrats and three \n     Republicans, are against releasing the memos. Presidents rely \n     on the Solicitor General's Office to give them legal advice. \nThey don't want those lawyers to be worrying about how their memos will \nimpact future attempts to win judicial seats. The White House has \nrefused to release the documents.\n\n  California's Redding Record Searchlight, 2/15/03:\n\n       Well, but the administration won't hand over memos he wrote \n     when he was in the solicitor general's office, say the Senate \n     Democrats. It apparently does not matter to them that \n     publicizing them could rob future memos of their candor and \n     that every former solicitor general of either party has said \n     the Democrats seek too much.\n\n  Rhode Island's Providence Journal-Bulletin, 2/14/03:\n\n       [Democrats] have demanded not only supplementary detailed \n     responses to political inquiries, but also Mr. Estrada's \n     confidential memoranda written while he was an assistant \n     solicitor general. Every living solicitor general, Democratic \n     and Republican, has gone on record to oppose this unwarranted \n     intrusion into the deliberative process in the Justice \n     Department. And the Bush administration has been correct to \n     resist Democratic demands.\n\n  Chicago Tribune, 2/10/03:\n\n       The Justice Department has refused to release Estrada's \n     memos, noting that such documents have always been regarded \n     as confidential. Every living former solicitor general, \n     Democratic and Republican, has publicly endorsed that \n     position. They say making the documents public would \n     discourage government lawyers from offering candid advice. \n     Anyone who wants a glimpse into Estrada's thinking can \n     scrutinize the briefs he wrote and oral arguments he made.\n\n  Detroit News, 2/11/03:\n\n       Democrats also demanded that he produce his memos and \n     recommendations while he was in the solicitor general's \n     office--which had never been done for any other candidate who \n     had been an assistant in that office. The demand was rejected \n     not only by Estrada, but by every former solicitor general \n     still living, including those who served Democratic \n     presidents.\n\n  Tampa Tribune, 2/10/03:\n\n       Yet the Democrats claim they don't know enough about \n     Estrada. They have demanded to see copies of his work in the \n     Justice Department, intentionally seeking papers they knew to \n     be confidential. Because Estrada did not turn them over, they \n     have attempted to crucify him, this despite letters from \n     former solicitors general complaining that their demand \n     amounted to legislative overreach and that acceding to it \n     would set a dangerous precedent.\n\n  St. Louis Post-Dispatch, 2/7/03:\n\n       Mr. Estrada is an immigrant from Honduras who went to \n     Harvard Law School, clerked on the Supreme Court and worked \n     in the Solicitor General's office. Democrats, frustrated by \n     the absence of a paper trail, and Mr. Estrada's sometimes-\n     evasive answers on issues such as abortion, tried to get \n     legal memos that Mr. Estrada wrote while in the Solicitor \n     General's office. But both Democratic and Republican \n     solicitors general have urged that the memos be kept private \n     so that future solicitors general receive candid views from \n     their staff. In short, the Democratic position doesn't \n     justify a filibuster.\n\n  Washington Post, 2/5/03:\n\n       Mr. Estrada's nomination in no way justifies a filibuster. \n     The case against him is that he is a conservative who was \n     publicly criticized by a former supervisor in the Office of \n     the Solicitor General, where he once worked. He was not \n     forthcoming with the committee in its efforts to discern his \n     personal views on controversial issues--as many nominees are \n     not--and the administration has (rightly) declined to provide \n     copies of his confidential memos from his service in \n     government.\n\n  Also from the Washington Post, September 29 of last year:\n\n       Democrats are still pushing to see confidential memos Mr. \n     Estrada wrote in the solicitor general's office and \n     trumpeting criticism of him by a single supervisor in that \n     office--criticism that has been discredited by that same \n     colleague's written evaluations. Seeking Mr. Estrada's work \n     product as a government lawyer is beyond any reasonable \n     inquiry into what sort of judge he would be. Nor is it fair \n     to reject someone as a judge because that person's decision \n     to practice law, rather than write articles or engage in \n     politics, makes his views more opaque. And it is terribly \n     wrong to demand that Mr. Estrada answer charges to which \n     nobody is willing to attach his or her name.\n\n  The Press-Enterprise, Riverside, CA, entitled ``Advice and \nFilibuster,'' 2/18/03:\n\n       Democratic senators are frustrated by the White House's \n     refusal to release to them memoranda he wrote as solicitor \n     general. But in the best of times, such a request would be \n     out of line, and these are closer to the worst than to the \n     best for the nomination process. If the memoranda were to be \n     used as an honest beginning to a discussion of Mr. Estrada's \n     legal views, there might be some justification for releasing \n     the documents that would normally be considered privileged. \n     One suspects that's not the role the Democrats have in mind \n     for the memoranda. They probably hope to expose Mr. Estrada's \n     conservative views, which no one doubts he holds, in hopes of \n     defeating the nomination or at least scoring some political \n     points.\n\n  Winston-Salem Journal, 2/20/03:\n\n       [Democrats] have demanded that [Mr. Estrada] turn over \n     confidential papers from his years as solicitor general. \n     Congress should not be asking for such material, as all \n     living solicitors general have said in a letter.\n\n  Mr. President, as I said, over 60 editorials share this view. Only 8 \nhave expressed an opposite view.\n  Mr. President, the hour is late, or early, depending on how you see \nit. I hope that my friends on the other side of the aisle will see \ndifferently tomorrow in the light of day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/26/senate-section/article/S2829-1", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2829]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following \npaper, ``Race-sensitive Admissions: Back to Basics,'' by William G. \nBowen, president emeritus of Princeton University, and Neil L. \nRudenstine, president emeritus of Harvard University, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       The controversy (and confusion) surrounding the White \n     House's recent statements on the use of race in college and \n     university admissions indicate the need for careful \n     examination of the underlying issues. The Justice Department \n     has filed a brief with the U.S. Supreme Court urging it to \n     declare two race-sensitive policies at the University of \n     Michigan unconstitutional; however, the brief does not rule \n     out ever taking\n\n[[Page S2830]]\n\n     race into account, but argues that institutions should first \n     exhaust all ``race-neutral'' alternatives. Secretary of State \n     Colin Powell has publicly said that he supports not just \n     affirmative action, but also the Michigan policies. National \n     Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice says she opposes the \n     specific methods used by Michigan, but recognizes the need to \n     take race into account in admissions.\n       As the Supreme Court prepares to hear oral arguments in a \n     case that will shape college admissions processes in the \n     coming decades, those of us who believe that such processes \n     should be permitted to include a nuanced consideration of \n     race must speak out clearly as well as forcefully. Too often, \n     we fear, the key issues have been oversimplified or \n     overlooked. Having been personally involved with this highly \n     contentious subject for more than 30 years, we would like to \n     try to frame the discussion by offering a set of nine \n     connected propositions about race and admissions that derive \n     from core human values and substantial empirical research.\n       1. The twin goals served by race-sensitive admissions \n     remain critically important.\n       The debate over race-sensitive admissions has relevance \n     only at public and private institutions of higher education \n     that have to choose among considerably more qualified \n     candidates than they can admit. Essentially all of these \n     ``academically selective'' colleges and universities have \n     elected to take race into account in making admissions \n     decisions, a fact that, in itself, has considerable import. \n     Race-sensitive admissions programs are intended to serve two \n     important purposes:\n       To enrich the learning environment by giving all students \n     the opportunity to share perspective and exchange points of \n     view with classmates from varied backgrounds. The recognition \n     of the educational power of diversity led many colleges and \n     universities--well before the mid-1960s, when the term \n     affirmative action began to be used--to craft incoming \n     classes that included students representing a wide variety of \n     interests, talents, backgrounds, and perspectives. The Shape \n     of the River, written by William Bowen and Derek Bok, \n     provides abundant evidence that graduates of these \n     institutions value educational diversity and, in general, are \n     strong supporters of race-sensitive admissions. Survey \n     responses from more than 90,000 alumni of selective colleges \n     and universities show that nearly 80 percent of those who \n     enrolled in 1976 and 1989 felt that their alma mater placed \n     the right amount of emphasis--or not enough--on diversity in \n     the admissions process. That same survey also found that \n     there is much more interaction across racial lines than many \n     people suppose. In the 1989 entering cohort, 56 percent of \n     white matriculants and 88 percent of black matriculants \n     indicated that they ``knew well'' two or more classmates of \n     the other race.\n       To serve the needs of the professions, of business, of \n     government, and of society more generally by educating large \n     numbers of well-prepared minority students who can assume \n     positions of leadership--thereby reducing somewhat the \n     continuing disparity in access to power and responsibility \n     that is related to race in America. Since colonial days, \n     colleges and universities have accepted an obligation to \n     educate individuals who will play leadership roles in \n     society. Today, that requires taking account of the clearly \n     articulated needs of business and the professions for a \n     healthier mix of well-educated leaders and practitioners from \n     varied racial and ethnic backgrounds. Professional groups \n     like the America Bar Association and the American Medical \n     Association, and businesses like General Motors, Microsoft, \n     and American Airlines (among many others), have explicitly \n     endorsed affirmative-action policies in higher education. \n     Leading law firms, hospitals, and businesses depend heavily \n     on their ability to recruit broadly trained individuals from \n     many racial backgrounds who are able to perform at the \n     highest level in settings that are themselves increasingly \n     diverse. A prohibition on the consideration of race in \n     admissions would drastically reduce minority participation in \n     the most selective professional programs. Does it make any \n     sense to resegregate, de facto, many of the country's most \n     respected professional schools and to slow the progress that \n     has been made in achieving diversity within the professions? \n     We don't think so.\n       2. Private colleges and universities are as likely as their \n     public counterparts to be affected by the outcome of this \n     debate.\n       The fact that litigation over affirmative action has, thus \n     far, centered on public universities should not lead that \n     private institutions will be unaffected. The 1996 federal-\n     court ruling in Hopwood v. Texas, banning race-sensitive \n     admission policies in Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi, has \n     been understood to cover Rice University as well as public \n     universities such as the University of Texas. Title VI of the \n     Civil Rights Act of 1964 subjects all institutions that \n     receive federal funds to any court determinations as to \n     what constitutes ``discrimination.'' Because many private \n     colleges and universities have invested substantial \n     resources in creating diverse entering classes, they might \n     well be more dramatically affected by any limitation on \n     their freedom to consider race than would most public \n     institutions. That is especially true because they are, in \n     general, smaller and more selective in admissions than \n     their public counterparts.\n       It matters that minority applicants have access to the most \n     selective programs, at both undergraduate and graduate \n     levels, in both private and public institutions. The argument \n     that they will surely be able to ``get in somewhere'' rings \n     hollow to many people. As one black woman quoted in The Shape \n     of the River observed wryly to a white parent: ``Are you \n     telling me that all those white folks fighting so hard to get \n     their kids into Duke and Stanford are just ignorant? Or are \n     we supposed to believe that attending a top-ranked school is \n     important for their children but not for mine?'' That \n     interchange was not just about perceptions. Various studies \n     show that the short-term and long-term gains associated with \n     attending the most selective institutions are, if anything, \n     greater for minority students than for white students, and \n     that academic and other resources are concentrated \n     increasingly in the top-tier colleges and universities.\n       3. Race-sensitive admissions policies involve much \n     ``picking and choosing'' among individual applicants; they \n     need not be mechanical, are not quota systems, and involve \n     making bets about likely student contributions to campus life \n     and, subsequently, to the larger society.\n       Contrary to what some people believe, admissions decisions \n     at academically selective public and private colleges and \n     universities are much more than a ``numbers game.'' They \n     involve considerations that extend far beyond test scores and \n     GPAs. Analysis of new data from leading private research \n     universities for the undergraduate class entering in 1999 \n     (reported in the forthcoming Reclaiming the Game, by William \n     G. Bowen and Sarah A. Levin) indicates that a very \n     considerable number of high-scoring minority students were \n     turned down. For instance, among male minority applicants \n     with combined SAT scores in the 1200-1299 range (which put \n     them well within the top 10 percent of minority test-takers \n     and the top 20 percent of all test-takers, regardless of \n     race), the odds of admission were about 35 percent: that is, \n     roughly two out of three of these minority applicants were \n     denied admission. At the very top of the SAT distribution (in \n     the 1400-plus range), nearly two out of five were not \n     admitted. Public universities are larger and somewhat less \n     selective, but they also turn down very high-scoring minority \n     candidates. At two public universities for which detailed \n     data are available, one out of four minority candidates in \n     the 1200 to 1399 SAT range was rejected.\n       In short, admissions officers at both private and public \n     universities have been doing exactly what Justice Powell, in \n     the landmark 1978 decision, Regents of the University of \n     California v. Bakke, said that they should be allowed to do: \n     pursuing ``race-sensitive'' admission policies that entail \n     considering race among other factors. They have been weighing \n     considerations that are both objective (advanced-placement \n     courses taken in high school, for example) and subjective \n     (indications of drive, intellectual curiosity, leadership \n     ability, and so on). And they have been selecting very well. \n     According to all the available evidence, minority students \n     admitted to academically selective colleges and universities \n     as long ago as the mid-1970s have been shown to be successful \n     in completing rigorous graduate programs, doing well in the \n     marketplace, and, most notably, contributing in the civic \n     arena out of all proportion to their numbers.\n       Minority candidates are, of course, by no means the only \n     group of applicants to receive special consideration. \n     Colleges and universities have long paid special attention to \n     children of alumni, to ``development cases,'' to applicants \n     who come from poor families or who have otherwise overcome \n     special obstacles, to applicants who will add to the \n     geographic (including international) diversity of the student \n     body, to students with special talents in fields such as \n     music, and, especially in recent years, to athletes. Some \n     readers may be surprised to learn from Reclaiming the Game \n     that recruited athletes at many selective colleges are far \n     more advantaged in the admission process (that is, are much \n     more likely to be admitted at a given SAT level) than are \n     minority candidates.\n       A related topic deserves some emphasis, and that is the \n     issue of ``quotas.'' There is not space here to discuss the \n     subject in detail, but one point is important to clarify. The \n     fact that the percentage of minority students in many \n     colleges and universities does not fluctuate substantially \n     from year to year is in no sense prima facie evidence that \n     quotas are being used. Anyone familiar with admissions \n     processes--and with their basic statistics--knows that \n     percentages for virtually all subgroups of any reasonable \n     size are remarkably consistent from year to year. That is \n     because the size of the college-going population does not \n     change significantly on an annual basis, nor do the numbers \n     and quality of secondary schools from which institutions draw \n     applications, nor does the number of qualified candidates. \n     All of these numbers are very stable, and it is therefore not \n     at all surprising that incoming college classes should change \n     very little in their composition from year to year. (For \n     example, we suspect that the fraction of an entering class \n     wearing eyeglasses is remarkable consistent from year to \n     year, but that would hardly persuade us that an eyeglass \n     quota is being imposed.)\n       4. Selectivity and ``merit'' involve predictions about on-\n     campus learning environments and future contributions to \n     society.\n       One of the most common misconceptions is that candidates \n     who have scored above some level or earned a certain grade-\n     point average ``deserve'' a place in an academically \n     selective institution. That ``entitlement'' notion\n\n[[Page S2831]]\n\n     is squarely at odds with the fundamental principle that, in \n     choosing among a large number of well-qualified applicants, \n     all of whom are over a high threshold, colleges and \n     universities are making bets on the future, not giving \n     rewards for prior accomplishments. Institutions are meant to \n     take well-considered risks. That can involve turning down \n     candidate ``A'' (who is entirely admissible but does not \n     stand out in any particular way) in favor of candidate ``B'' \n     (who is expected to contribute more to the educational milieu \n     of the institution and appears to have better long-term \n     prospects of making a major contribution to society). All \n     applicants, of course, deserve to be evaluated fairly, which \n     means treating them the same way as other similarly situated \n     candidates; but, in the words of Lee Bollinger, president of \n     Columbia University and former president of the University of \n     Michigan, ``there is no right to be admitted to a university \n     without regard to how the overall makeup of the student body \n     will affect the educational process or without regard to the \n     needs of the society . . . ``Merit'' is not a simple concept. \n     It has certainly never meant admitting all the valedictorians \n     who apply, or choosing students strictly on the basis of test \n     scores and GPAs.\n       An elaborate admissions process, which focuses on the \n     particular characteristics of individuals within many \n     subgroups--and on those of the entire pool of applicants--is \n     designed to craft a class that will, in its diversity, be a \n     potent source of educational vitality. Colleges use a variety \n     of procedures to take account of race, and it is essential \n     that differences of opinion concerning the wisdom (or even \n     the legality) of any single approach not lead to an outcome \n     that precludes other approaches.\n       5. Paying special attention to any group in making \n     admissions decisions entails costs; but the costs of race-\n     sensitive admissions have been modest and well-justified by \n     the benefits.\n       The ``opportunity cost'' of admitting any particular \n     student is that another applicant will not be chosen. But \n     such choices are rarely ``head-to-head'' decisions. For \n     example, there is no reason to believe--as reverse-\n     discrimination lawsuits generally assume--that if a \n     particular minority student had not been accepted, his or her \n     place would have been given to a complainant with comparable \n     or better test scores or grades. The choice might, instead, \n     have been an even higher-scoring minority student who had not \n     been admitted, a student from a foreign country, or a lower-\n     scoring white student from one of several subgroups that are \n     given extra consideration in the admissions process. Making \n     hard choices on the margin is never easy and always--\n     fortunately--involves human judgments made by experienced \n     admissions officers. It is, in any case, wrong to assume that \n     race-sensitive admissions policies have significantly reduced \n     the changes of well-qualified white students to gain \n     admission to the most selective colleges. Findings reported \n     in The Shape of the River, based on data for a subset of \n     selective colleges and universities, demonstrate that \n     elimination of race-sensitive policies would have increased \n     the admission rate for white students by less than two \n     percentage points: from roughly 25 percent of 26.5 percent.\n       It should be emphasized that taking race into account in \n     making admissions decisions does not appear to have two kinds \n     of costs often mentioned by critics of these policies.\n       First, there is no systemic evidence that race-sensitive \n     admissions policies tend to ``harm the beneficiaries'' by \n     putting them in settings in which they are overmatched \n     intellectually or ``stigmatized'' to the point that they \n     would have been better off attending a less selective \n     institution. On the contrary, extensive analysis of data \n     reported in The Shape of the River shows that minority \n     students at selective schools have, overall, performed well. \n     The more selective the school that they attended, the more \n     likely they were to graduate and earn advanced degrees, the \n     happier they were with their college experience, and the more \n     successful they were in later life.\n       Second, the available evidence disposes of the argument \n     that the substitution of ``race-sensitive'' for ``race-\n     neutral'' admissions policies has led to admission of many \n     minority students who are not well-suited to take advantage \n     of the educational opportunities they are being offered. \n     Examination of the later accomplishments of those students \n     who would have been ``retrospectively rejected'' under race-\n     neutral policies shows that they did just as well as a \n     hypothetical reference group that might have been admitted if \n     GPAs and test scores had been the primary criteria (which is, \n     itself, a questionable assumption). There are no significant \n     differences in graduation rates, advanced-degree attainment, \n     earnings, civic contributions, or satisfactions with college. \n     In short, the abandonment of race-sensitive admissions would \n     not have removed from campuses a marginal group of mediocre \n     students. Rather, it would have deprived campuses of much of \n     their diversity and diminished the capacity of the \n     academically selective institutions to benefit larger numbers \n     of talented minority students.\n       6. Progress has been made in narrowing test-score gaps \n     between minority students and other students, but gaps \n     remain.\n       A frequently asked question is: Are we getting anywhere? \n     Data on average test scores in Reclaiming the Game are \n     encouraging. At a group of liberal-arts colleges and \n     universities examined in 1976 and 1995, average combined SAT \n     test scores for minority students rose roughly 130 points at \n     the liberal-arts colleges and roughly 150 points at the \n     research universities. Test scores for other students rose, \n     too, but by much smaller amounts (roughly 30 points at the \n     liberal-arts colleges and roughly 70 points at the research \n     universities). Test-score gaps narrowed over this period, and \n     the average rank-in-class of minority students on college \n     graduation improved even more than one would have predicted \n     on the basis of test scores alone. As anyone who has studied \n     campus life can attest, there are also many impressionistic \n     signs of progress. Minority students are more involved in a \n     wide range of activities, and increasing numbers of children \n     of minority students of an earlier day are now reaching the \n     age where they are beginning to enroll as ``second \n     generation'' college students. Graduates are also \n     increasingly making their presence known in the professions \n     and business world.\n       Still, test-score gaps remain (of roughly 100 to 140 points \n     in the private colleges and universities for which we have \n     data), and so there is still more progress to be made. That \n     is hardly surprising, given the deep-seated nature of the \n     factors that impede academic opportunity and achievement \n     among minority groups--including the fact that a very large \n     proportion of such students continue to attend primary and \n     secondary schools that are underfinanced, insufficiently \n     challenging, and often segregated. It would be naive to \n     expect that a problem as long in the making as the racial \n     divide in educational preparation could be eradicated in a \n     generation or two.\n       7. There are alternative ways of pursuing diversity, but \n     all substitutes for race-sensitive admissions have serious \n     limitations.\n       Many of us have a strong appetite for apparently painless \n     alternatives, and it is natural to look for ways to achieve \n     ``diversity'' without directly confronting the emotion-laden \n     issue of race. Several alternatives to race-sensitive \n     admissions have been suggested. For example, colleges and \n     universities have been urged to:\n       Focus on the economically disadvantaged. The argument is \n     that, since racial minorities are especially likely to be \n     poor, racial diversity could be promoted in this way (an \n     approach sometimes referred to as ``class-based affirmative \n     action''). The results, however, would not be what some \n     people might expect. Several studies have shown that there \n     are simply very few minority candidates for admission to \n     academically selective institutions who are both poor and \n     academically qualified.\n       Adopt a ``percentage plan'' whereby all high-school \n     students in a state who graduate in the top X percent of \n     their classes are automatically guaranteed a place in one of \n     the state's universities. In states like Texas, where the \n     secondary-school system is highly segregated, that approach \n     can yield a significant number of minority admissions at the \n     undergraduate level (although the actual effects, even at the \n     undergraduate level, have been shown by the social scientists \n     Marta Tienda and John F. Kain to be more limited than many \n     have suggested). Moreover, the process is highly mechanical. \n     Students in the top X percent are not simply awarded \n     ``points,'' as the undergraduate program at the University of \n     Michigan does. Rather, they are given automatic admission \n     without any prior scrutiny, and without any consideration of \n     the fact that some high schools are much stronger \n     academically than others.\n       Even if one considered the top-X-percent plan to be viable \n     at state institutions, it could not work at all at private \n     institutions, which admit from national and international \n     pools of applicants and are so selective that they must turn \n     down the vast majority who apply--including very large \n     numbers of students who graduate at or near the top of their \n     secondary-school classes. Private institutions could not \n     conceivably adopt a policy that would automatically give \n     admission to students in the top X percent of their class at \n     the hundreds and hundreds of schools--worldwide--from which \n     they attract applicants.\n       The top-X-percent plan is also entirely ineffective at the \n     professional and graduate-school level, because (like \n     selective undergraduate colleges) these schools have national \n     and international applicant pools, with no conceivable \n     ``reference group'' of colleges to which they could possibly \n     give such an admission guarantee. Even if there were a set of \n     undergraduate colleges whose top graduates would be \n     guaranteed admission to certain professional schools, the \n     result would not represent any marked degree of racial \n     diversity. For example, if the top 10 percent of students in \n     the academically selective colleges and universities studied \n     in Reclaiming the Game were offered admission to a \n     professional school (an unrealistically high percentage given \n     the intensely competitive nature of the admission process), \n     only 3 percent of the students included in that group would \n     be underrepresented minorities--and, of course, only some \n     modest fraction of those students would be interested even in \n     applying to such programs. If we are examining a top-5-\n     percent plan, the minority component of the pool would be \n     about one-half of 1 percent. Without some explicit \n     consideration of race, professional schools that ordinarily \n     admit a significant number of their students from selective \n     colleges would simply not be able to enroll a diverse student \n     body.\n       Other troubling questions include: Do we really want to \n     endorse an admissions approach that depends on de facto \n     segregation\n\n[[Page S2832]]\n\n     at the secondary-school level? Do we want to impose an \n     arbitrary and mechanical admissions standard--based on fixed \n     rank-in-class--on a process that should involve careful \n     consideration of all of an applicant's qualifications as well \n     as thoughtful attention to the overall characteristics of the \n     applicant pool?\n       Place heavy weight on ``geographic distribution'' and so-\n     called ``experiential'' factors, such as a student's ability \n     to overcome obstacles and handicaps of various kinds, or the \n     experience of living in a home where a language other than \n     English is spoken. The argument here is that, if special \n     attention were given to these and analogous criteria, then a \n     sizable pool of qualified minority students would \n     automatically be created.\n       But, as we have mentioned, colleges have been using \n     precisely such criteria for many decades, and they have \n     discovered--not surprisingly--that there are large numbers of \n     very competitive ``majority'' candidates in all of the \n     suggested categories. For example, if a student's home \n     language is Russian, Polish, Arabic, Korean, or Hebrew, will \n     that be weighted by a college as strongly as Spanish? If not, \n     then the institutions will clearly be giving conscious \n     preference to a group of underrepresented minority students--\n     Hispanic students--in a deliberate way that explicitly takes \n     ethnicity (or, in other cases, race) into account.\n       Similar issues arise with respect to other experiential \n     categories, as well as geographic distribution. There is no \n     need to speculate about (or experiment with) such approaches, \n     because colleges have already had nearly a half century of \n     experience applying them, and there is ample evidence that \n     the hoped-for results, in terms of minority representation, \n     are not what many people now suggest or claim. Moreover, \n     insofar as such categories were to become surreptitious \n     gateways for minority students, they would soon run the risk \n     of breeding cynicism, and almost certainly inviting legal \n     challenges.\n       All of the indirect approaches just described pose serious \n     problems. Nor can they be accurately described as ``race-\n     neutral.'' They have all been proposed with the clear goal \n     (whether practicable or not) of producing an appreciable \n     representation of minority students in higher education. In \n     some cases, they involve the conscious use of a kind of \n     social engineering decried by critics of race-sensitive \n     admissions.\n       Surely the best way to achieve racial diversity is to \n     acknowledge candidly that minority status is one among many \n     factors that can be considered in an admissions process \n     designed to judge individuals on a case-by-case basis. We can \n     see no reason why a college or university should be compelled \n     to experiment with--and ``exhaust''--all suggested \n     alternative approaches before it can turn to a carefully \n     tailored race-sensitive policy that focuses on individual \n     cases. The alternative approaches are susceptible to \n     systematic analysis, based on experience and empirical \n     investigation. A preponderance of them have been tested for \n     decades. All can be shown to be seriously deficient. Indeed, \n     if genuinely race-neutral (and educationally appropriate) \n     methods were available, colleges and universities would long \n     ago have gladly embraced them.\n       8. Reasonable degrees of institutional autonomy should be \n     permitted--accompanied by a clear expectation of \n     accountability.\n       As the courts have recognized in other contexts (for \n     example, in giving reasonable deference to administrative \n     agencies), a balance has to be struck between judicial \n     protection of rights guaranteed to all of us by the \n     Constitution and the desirability of giving a presumption of \n     validity to the judgments of those with special knowledge, \n     experience, and closeness to the actual decisions being made. \n     The widely acclaimed heterogeneity of the American system of \n     higher education has permitted much experimentation in \n     admissions, as in other areas, and has discouraged the kinds \n     of government-mandated uniformity that we find in many other \n     parts of the world. Serious consideration should be given to \n     the disadvantages of imposing too many ``do's'' and \n     ``don'ts'' on admissions policies.\n       The case for allowing a considerable degree of \n     institutional autonomy in such sensitive and complex \n     territory is inextricably tied, in our view, to a clear \n     acceptance by colleges and universities of accountability for \n     the policies they elect and the ways such policies are given \n     effect. There is, to be sure, much more accountability today \n     than many people outside the university world recognize. \n     Admissions practices are highly visible and are subject to \n     challenge by faculty members, trustees and regents, avid \n     investigative reporters, disappointed applicants, and the \n     public at large. Colleges and universities operate in more of \n     a ``fishbowl'' environment than the great majority of other \n     private and public entities. Nonetheless, we favor even \n     stronger commitments by colleges and universities to monitor \n     closely how specific admissions policies work out in \n     practice. Studies of outcomes should be a regular part of \n     college and university operations, and if it is found, for \n     example, that minority students (or other students) accepted \n     with certain test scores or other qualifications are \n     consistently doing poorly, then some change in policy--or \n     some change in the personnel responsible for administering \n     the stated policy--may well be in order.\n       That point was made with special force by a very \n     conservative friend of ours, Charles Exley, former chairman \n     and CEO of NCR Corporation and a onetime trustee of Wesleyan \n     University. In a pointed conversation that one of us (Bowen) \n     will long remember, Exley explained that he held essentially \n     the same view that we hold concerning who should select the \n     criteria and make admissions decisions. ``I would probably \n     not admit the same class that you would admit, even though \n     I don't know how different the classes would be,'' he \n     said. ``You will certainly make mistakes,'' he went on, \n     ``but I would much rather live with your errors than with \n     those that will inevitably result from the imposition of \n     more outside constraints, including legislative and \n     judicial interventions.'' And then, with the nicest smile, \n     he concluded: ``And, if you make too many mistakes, the \n     trustees can always fire you!''\n       9. Race matters profoundly in America; it differs \n     fundamentally from other ``markers'' of diversity, and it has \n     to be understood on its own terms.\n       We believe that it is morally wrong and historically \n     indefensible to think of race as ``just another'' dimension \n     of diversity. It is a critically important dimension, but it \n     is also far more difficult than others to address. The \n     fundamental reason is that racial classifications were used \n     in this country for more than 300 years in the most odious \n     ways to deprive people of their basic rights. The fact that \n     overt discrimination has now been outlawed should not lead us \n     to believe that race no longer matters. As the legal scholar \n     Ronald Dworkin has put it, ``the worst of\n     the stereotypes, suspicions, fears, and\n     hatreds that still poison America are color-coded . . .''\n       The after effects of this long history continue to place \n     racial minorities (and especially African-Americans) in \n     situations in which embedded perceptions and stereotypes \n     limit opportunities and create divides that demean us all. \n     This social reality, described with searing precision by the \n     economist Glenn C. Loury in The Anatomy of Racial Inequality, \n     explains why persistence is required in efforts to overcome, \n     day by day, the vestiges of our country's ``unlovely racial \n     history.'' We believe that it would be perverse in the \n     extreme if, after many generations when race was used in the \n     service of blatant discrimination, colleges and universities \n     were now to be prevented from considering race at all, when, \n     at last, we are learning how to use nuanced forms of race-\n     sensitive admissions to improve education for everyone and to \n     diminish racial disparities.\n       The former Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach draws a \n     sharp distinction between the use of race to exclude a group \n     of people from educational opportunity (``racial \n     discrimination'') and the use of race to enhance learning for \n     all students, thereby serving the mission of colleges and \n     universities chartered to serve the public good. No one \n     contends that white students are being excluded by any \n     college or university today simply because they are white.\n       William G.

Mr. President, today the Commission on Opportunity in \nAthletics sent Secretary Rod Paige their recommendations to change the \nlandmark gender equity law--Title IX.\n  Two members of the Commission--Julie Foudy and Donna de Varona--\ndecided not to sign the report and instead submitted a minority report \nbecause they found the final report slanted, incomplete, and failing to \nacknowledge that discrimination against women in education still \nexists. I am very disappointed the Commission did not write a more \nbalanced report, which all members would have felt comfortable signing.\n  Since its passage more than 30 years ago as part of the Education \nAmendments of 1972, Title IX has played a monumental role in the \nadvancement of equality for women throughout America. This landmark \nlegislation has opened the doors to colleges, universities and sports \nteam locker rooms for our sisters, daughters and friends. Women's \nparticipation in sports has dramatically increased so that women now \nmake up about 40 percent of all college athletics, compared with 15 \npercent in 1972. Studies have shown that women who participate in \nathletics learn important values such as, teamwork, leadership, and \ndiscipline--values that stay with them throughout their lives.\n  On January 29, Senators Daschle, Snowe, Kennedy, Specter, Murray\n\n[[Page S2833]]\n\nand I wrote to Education Secretary Rod Paige urging him to defend and \nstrengthen the enforcement of current Title IX policies and \nregulations. Today, I joined those same Senators in a letter urging \nPresident Bush to reaffirm the current policies under Title IX and to \nreject the changes to those policies proposed by the Commission.\n  Over the past 30 years, Title IX has been a good and fair law and it \nshould not be weakened in any way. I urge President Bush and Education \nSecretary Rod Paige to give as much consideration to the report filed \nby Julie Foudy and Donna de Varona as they do to the majority report \nand to ultimately reject any efforts to weaken Title IX and its goal to \naddress widespread sex discrimination in athletics and all other \naspects of education.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/26/senate-section/article/S2833-1", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2833]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. In the last Congress Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Act, a bill that would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence \nof any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred in March 2001 \nin Portage, WI. A gay man was found murdered in an apartment. The \nassailant, Darrin Grosskopf, was drinking with the victim, Keith Ward, \nand claimed that Ward made sexual advances toward him. Grosskopf told \npolice that he thought Ward was a homosexual. When police found Ward's \nbody in the apartment, he was naked and had a stab wound in his chest.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/26/senate-section/article/S2833-2", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2833-S2834]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     RULES OF THE SENATE: PERMANENT SUBCOMMITTEE ON INVESTIGATIONS\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, Senate Standing Rule XXVI requires each \ncommittee to adopt rules to govern the procedure of the Committee and \nto publish those rules in the Congressional Record not later than March \n1 of the first year of each Congress. On February 26, 2003, a majority \nof the members of the Committee on Governmental Affairs' Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations adopted subcommittee rules of procedure.\n  Consistent with Standing Rule XXVI, I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record a copy of the rules of the Permanent Subcommittee \non Investigations.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n108th Congress Rules of Procedure for the Senate Permanent Subcommittee \non Investigations of the Committee on Governmental Affairs as Adopted--\n                           February 26, 2003\n\n       1. No public hearing connected with an investigation may be \n     held without approval of either the Chairman and the Ranking \n     Minority Member or the approval of a majority of the Members \n     of the Subcommittee. In all cases, notification to all \n     Members of the intent to hold hearings must be given at least \n     7 days in advance to the date of the hearing. The Ranking \n     Minority Member should be kept fully apprised of preliminary \n     inquiries, investigations, and hearings. Preliminary \n     inquiries may be initiated by the Subcommittee majority staff \n     upon the approval of the Chairman and notice of such approval \n     to the Ranking Minority Member or the minority counsel. \n     Preliminary inquiries may be undertaken by the minority staff \n     upon the approval of the Ranking Minority Member and notice \n     of such approval to the Chairman or Chief Counsel. \n     Investigations may be undertaken upon the approval of the \n     Chairman of the Subcommittee and the Ranking Minority Member \n     with notice of such approval to all members.\n       No public hearing shall be held if the minority Members \n     unanimously object, unless the full Committee on Governmental \n     Affairs by a majority vote approves of such public hearing.\n       Senate Rules will govern all closed sessions convened by \n     the Subcommittee (Rule XXVI, Sec. 5(b), Standing Rules of the \n     Senate).\n       2. Subpoenas for witnesses, as well as documents and \n     records, may be authorized and issued by the Chairman, or any \n     other Member of the Subcommittee designated by him, with \n     notice to the Ranking Minority Member. A written notice of \n     intent to issue a subpoena shall be provided to the Chairman \n     and Ranking Minority Member of the Committee, or staff \n     officers designated by them, by the Subcommittee Chairman or \n     a staff officer designated by him, immediately upon such \n     authorization, and no subpoena shall issue for at least 48 \n     hours, excluding Saturdays and Sundays, from delivery to the \n     appropriate offices, unless the Chairman and Ranking Minority \n     Member waive the 48 hour waiting period or unless the \n     Subcommittee Chairman certifies in writing to the Chairman \n     and Ranking Minority Member that, in his opinion, it is \n     necessary to issue a subpoena immediately.\n       3. The Chairman shall have the authority to call meetings \n     of the Subcommittee. This authority may be delegated by the \n     Chairman to any other Member of the Subcommittee when \n     necessary.\n       4. If at least three Members of the Subcommittee desire the \n     Chairman to call a special meeting, they may file in the \n     office of the Subcommittee, a written request therfor, \n     addressed to the Chairman. Immediately thereafter, the clerk \n     of the Subcommittee shall notify the Chairman of such \n     request. If, within 3 calendar days after the filing of such \n     request, the Chairman fails to call the requested special \n     meeting, which is to be held within 7 calendar days after the \n     filing of such request, a majority of the Subcommittee \n     Members may file in the office of the Subcommittee their \n     written notice that a special Subcommittee meeting will be \n     held, specifying the date and hour thereof, and the \n     Subcommittee shall meet on that date and hour. Immediately \n     upon the filing of such notice, the Subcommittee clerk \n     shall notify all Subcommittee Members that such special \n     meeting will be held and inform them of its dates and \n     hour. If the Chairman is not present at any regular, \n     additional or special meeting, the ranking majority Member \n     present shall preside.\n       5. For public or executive sessions, one Member of the \n     Subcommittee shall constitute a quorum for the administering \n     of oaths and the taking of testimony in any given case or \n     subject matter.\n       Five (5) Members of the Subcommittee shall constitute a \n     quorum for the transaction of Subcommittee business other \n     than the administering of oaths and the taking of testimony.\n       6. All witnesses at public or executive hearings who \n     testify to matters of fact shall be sworn.\n       7. If, during public or executive sessions, a witness, his \n     counsel, or any spectator conducts himself in such a manner \n     as to prevent, impede, disrupt, obstruct, or interfere with \n     the orderly administration of such hearing, the Chairman or \n     presiding Member of the Subcommittee present during such \n     hearing may request the Sergeant at Arms of the Senate, his \n     representation or any law enforcement official to eject said \n     person from the hearing room.\n       8. Counsel retained by any witness and accompanying such \n     witness shall be permitted to be present during the testimony \n     of such witness at any public or executive hearing, and to \n     advise such witness while he/she is testifying, or his legal \n     rights, Provided, however, that in the case of any witness \n     who is an officer or employee of the government, or of a \n     corporation or association, the Subcommittee Chairman may \n     rule that representative by counsel from the government, \n     corporation, or association, or by counsel representing other \n     witnesses, creates a conflict of interest, and that the \n     witness may only be represented during interrogation by staff \n     or during testimony before the Subcommittee by personal \n     counsel not from the government, corporation, or association, \n     or by personal counsel not representing other witnesses. This \n     rule shall not be construed to excuse a witness from \n     testifying in the event his counsel is ejected for conducting \n     himself in such a manner so as to prevent, impede, disrupt, \n     obstruct, or interfere with the orderly administration of the \n     hearings; nor shall this rule be construed as authorizing \n     counsel to coach the witness or answer for the witness. The \n     failure of any witness to secure counsel shall not excuse \n     such witness from complying with a subpoena or deposition \n     notice.\n       9. Depositions.\n       9.1 Notice. Notices for the taking of depositions in an \n     investigation authorized by the Subcommittee shall be \n     authorized and issued by the Chairman. The Chairman of the \n     full Committee and the Ranking Minority Member of the \n     Subcommittee shall be kept fully apprised of the \n     authorization for the taking of depositions. Such notices \n     shall specify a time and place of examination, and the name \n     of the Subcommittee Member or Members or staff officer or \n     officers who will take the deposition. The deposition \n     shall be in private. The Subcommittee shall not initiate \n     procedures leading to criminal or civil enforcement \n     proceedings for a witness' failure to appear unless the \n     deposition notice was accompanied by a Subcommittee \n     subpoena.\n       9.2 Counsel. Witnesses may be accompanied at a deposition \n     by counsel to advise them of their legal rights, subject to \n     the provisions of Rule 8.\n       9.3 Procedure. Witnesses shall be examined upon oath \n     administered by an individual authorized by local law to \n     administer oaths. Questions shall be propounded orally by \n     Subcommittee Members or staff. Objections by the witness as \n     to the form of questions shall\n\n[[Page S2834]]\n\n     be noted for the record. If a witness objects to a question \n     and refuses to testify on the basis of relevance or \n     privilege, the Subcommittee Members or staff may proceed with \n     the deposition, or may, at that time or at a subsequent time, \n     seek a ruling by telephone or otherwise on the objection from \n     the Chairman or such Subcommittee Member as designated by \n     him. If the Chairman or designated Member overrules the \n     objection, he/she may refer the matter to the Subcommittee or \n     he/she may order and direct the witness to answer the \n     question, but the Subcommittee shall not initiate procedures \n     leading to civil or criminal enforcement unless the witness \n     refuses to testify after he/she has been ordered and directed \n     to answer by a Member of the Subcommittee.\n       9.4 Filing. The subcommittee staff shall see that the \n     testimony is transcribed or electronically recorded. If it is \n     transcribed, the witness shall be furnished with a copy for \n     review pursuant to the provisions of Rule 12. The individual \n     administering the oath shall certify on the transcript that \n     the witness was duly sworn in his presence, the transcriber \n     shall certify that the transcript is a true record of the \n     testimony, and the transcript shall then be filed with the \n     Subcommittee clerk. Subcommittee staff may stipulate with the \n     witness to changes in this procedure; deviations from this \n     procedure which do not substantially impair the reliability \n     of the record shall not relieve the witness from his \n     obligation to testify truthfully.\n       10. Any witness desiring to read a prepared or written \n     statement in executive or public hearings shall file a copy \n     of such statement with the Chief Counsel or Chairman of the \n     Subcommittee 48 hours in advance of the hearings at which the \n     statement is to be presented unless the Chairman and the \n     Ranking Minority Member waive this requirement. The \n     Subcommittee shall determine whether such statement may be \n     read or placed in the record of the hearing.\n       11. A witness may request, on grounds of distraction, \n     harassment, personal safety, or physical discomfort, that \n     during the testimony, television, motion picture, and other \n     cameras and lights shall not be directed at him. Such \n     requests shall be ruled on by the Subcommittee Members \n     present at the hearing.\n       12. An accurate stenographic record shall be kept of the \n     testimony of all witnesses in executive and public hearings. \n     The record of his own testimony whether in public or \n     executive session shall be made available for inspection by \n     witness or his counsel under Subcommittee supervision; a copy \n     of any testimony given in public session or that part of \n     the testimony given by the witness in executive session \n     and subsequently quoted or made part of the record in a \n     public session shall be made available to any witness at \n     his expense if he/she so requests.\n       13. Interrogation of witnesses at Subcommittee hearings \n     shall be conducted on behalf of the Subcommittee by Members \n     and authorized Subcommittee staff personnel only.\n       14. Any person who is the subject of an investigation in \n     public hearings may submit to the Chairman of the \n     Subcommittee questions in writing for the cross-examination \n     of other witnesses called by the Subcommittee. With the \n     consent of a majority of the Members of the Subcommittee \n     present and voting, these questions, or paraphrased versions \n     of them, shall be put to the witness by the Chairman, by a \n     Member of the Subcommittee or by counsel of the Subcommittee.\n       15. Any person whose name is mentioned or who is \n     specifically identified, and who believes that testimony or \n     other evidence presented at a public hearing, or comment made \n     by a Subcommittee Member or counsel, tends to defame him or \n     otherwise adversely affect his reputation, may (a) request to \n     appear personally before the Subcommittee to testify in his \n     own behalf, or, in the alternative, (b) file a sworn \n     statement of facts relevant to the testimony or other \n     evidence or comment complained of. Such request and such \n     statement shall be submitted to the Subcommittee for its \n     consideration and action.\n       If a person requests to appear personally before the \n     Subcommittee pursuant to alternative (a) referred to herein, \n     said request shall be considered untimely if it is not \n     received by the Chairman of the Subcommittee or its counsel \n     in writing on or before thirty (30) days subsequent to the \n     day on which said person's name was mentioned or otherwise \n     specifically identified during a public hearing held before \n     the Subcommittee, unless the Chairman and the Ranking \n     Minority Member waive this requirement.\n       If a person requests the filing of his sworn statement \n     pursuant to alternative (b) referred to herein, the \n     Subcommittee may condition the filing of said sworn statement \n     upon said person agreeing to appear personally before the \n     Subcommittee and to testify concerning the matters contained \n     in his sworn statement, as well as any other matters related \n     to the subject of the investigation before the Subcommittee.\n       16. All testimony taken in executive session shall be kept \n     secret and will not be released for public information \n     without the approval of a majority of the Subcommittee.\n       17. No Subcommittee report shall be released to the public \n     unless approved by a majority of the Subcommittee and after \n     no less than 10 days' notice and opportunity for comment by \n     the Members of the Subcommittee unless the need for such \n     notice and opportunity to comment has been waived in writing \n     by a majority of the minority Members.\n       18. The Ranking Minority Member may select for appointment \n     to the Subcommittee staff a Chief Counsel for the minority \n     and such other professional staff members and clerical \n     assistants as he/she deems advisable. The total compensation \n     allocated to such minority staff members shall be not less \n     than one-third the total amount allocated for all \n     Subcommittee staff salaries during any given year. The \n     minority staff members shall work under the direction and \n     supervision of the Ranking Minority Member. The Chief Counsel \n     for the minority shall be kept fully informed as to \n     preliminary inquiries, investigations, and hearings, and \n     shall have access to all material in the files of the \n     Subcommittee.\n       19. When it is determined by the Chairman and Ranking \n     Minority Member, or by a majority of the Subcommittee, that \n     there is reasonable cause to believe that a violation of law \n     may have occurred, the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member \n     by letter, or the Subcommittee by resolution, are authorized \n     to report such violation to the proper State, local and/or \n     Federal authorities. Such letter or report may recite the \n     basis for the determination of reasonable cause. This rule is \n     not authority for release of documents or testimony.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/26/senate-section/article/S2834-1", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2834]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          EXPLANATION OF VOTE\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of Democratic \nLeader Daschle's request to bring before the Senate the Economic \nRecovery Act of 2003, S. 414, which includes legislation I introduced \nlast month: the First Responders Partnership Grant Act of 2003. I \nregret that Republicans objected to proceeding to these important \nmatters when Senator Daschle requested we move to it yesterday.\n  I thank the Democratic leader for authoring this important economic \nstimulus package. In seeking to improve homeland security, I am proud \nthat he saw fit to include the First Responders Partnership Grant Act--\non which he, Democratic Whip Reid and Senator Breaux join me as \ncosponsors. This legislation will supply our Nation's first responders \nwith the support they so desperately need to protect homeland security \nand prevent and respond to acts of terrorism.\n  I want to begin by thanking each of our Nation's brave firefighters, \nemergency rescurers, law enforcement officers, and other first \nresponder personnel for the jobs they do for the American public day in \nand day out. Our public safety officers are often the first to respond \nto any crime or emergency situation. On September 11, the Nation saw \nthat the first on the scene at the World Trade Center were the heroic \nfirefighters, police officers and emergency personnel of New York City. \nThese real-life heroes, many of whom gave the ultimate sacrifice, \nremind us of how important it is to support our State and local public \nsafety partners.\n  But while we ask our Nation's first responders to defend us as never \nbefore on the front lines against the dark menace of domestic \nterrorism, we have failed to supply them with the Federal support they \nneed and deserve to protect us, as we expect and need them to protect \nus.\n  Since February 7, 2003, the Federal Homeland Security Advisory System \nhas kept State and local first responders on Orange Alert, a ``high'' \ncondition indicating a high probability of a terrorist attack and when \nadditional precautions by first responders are necessary at public \nevents.\n  Since then, counterterrorism officials have warned that the threat of \nterrorist attacks on U.S. soil is at a higher level than in previous \nmonths due to the possibility of impending military action against \nIraq. This is the second time since September 11, 2001, that the \nnational warning level has been at Orange Alert--from September 10 to \nSeptember 24 last year, Attorney General Ashcroft declared our country \nat Orange Threat level.\n  From March 12, 2002, until this month, we were at Yellow Alert, an \n``elevated'' threat level declared when\n\n[[Page S2835]]\n\nthere is a significant risk of terrorist attacks, requiring increased \nsurveillance of critical locations.\n  Counties, cities and towns in my home State of Vermont and across the \nU.S. find themselves overwhelmed by increasing homeland security costs \nrequired by the Federal Government. Indeed, the National Governors \nAssociation estimates that States incurred around $7 billion in \nsecurity costs over the past year alone.\n  As a result, the national threat alerts and other Federal homeland \nsecurity requirements have become unfunded Federal mandates on our \nState and local governments. Rutland County Sheriff R.J. Elrick, \npresident of the Vermont Sheriffs' Association, recently wrote to me, \n``We are in dire need of financial support to keep our personnel \ntrained and equipped to meet the challenges here as home as we continue \nour vigilant commitment to fight terrorism.''\n  When terrorists strike, first responders are and will always be the \nfirst people we turn to for help. We place our lives and the lives of \nour families and friends in the hands of these officers, trusting that \nwhen called upon they will protect and save us.\n  Just how, without supplying them with the necessary resources, do we \nexpect our Nation's first responders to realistically carry out their \nduties?\n  Our State and local law enforcement officers, firefighters and \nemergency personnel are full partners in preventing, investigating and \nresponding to terrorist acts. They need and deserve the full \ncollaboration of the Federal Government to meet these new national \nresponsibilities.\n  Washington is buzzing about the literally hundreds of billions of \nadditional dollars the President plans to ask Congress to provide for \nour military services to fight the war on terrorism abroad. The same \ncannot be said for helping security here at home, which is shamefully \noverlooked.\n  For a year and a half I have been working hard to remedy that, with \nallies like our distinguished Democratic leader and assistant \nDemocratic leader, and New York Senators Schumer and Clinton. As former \nchair and now ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, I have made it \na high priority to evaluate and meet the needs of our first responders.\n  For these reasons, I commend the Democratic leader for including in \nthe homeland security section of his economic stimulus package the \nFirst Responders Partnership Grant Act, which will give our Nation's \nlaw enforcement officers, firefighters and emergency personnel the \nresources they need to do their jobs. This legislation will establish a \ngrant program at the Department of Homeland Security to provide $5 \nbillion nationwide for current fiscal year to support State and local \npublic safety officers in their efforts to protect homeland security \nand prevent and respond to acts to terrorism.\n  Similar to the highly successful Department of Justice Community \nOriented Policing Services (COPS) and the Bulletproof Vest Partnership \nGrant Programs, the First Responder Grants will be made directly to \nState and local government units for overtime, equipment, training and \nfacility expenses to support our law enforcement officers, firefighters \nand emergency personnel.\n  The First Responder Grants may be used to pay up to 90 percent of the \ncost of the overtime, equipment, training or facility. In cases of \nfiscal hardship, the Department of Homeland Security may waive the \nlocal match requirement of 10 percent to provide Federal funds for \ncommunities that cannot afford the local match.\n  In a world shaped by the violent events of September 11, day after \nday we call upon our public safety officers to remain vigilant. We not \nonly ask them to put their lives at risk in the line of duty, but also, \nif need be, given their lives to protect us.\n  If we take time to listen to our Nation's State and local public \nsafety partners, they will tell us that they welcome the challenge to \njoin in our national mission to protect our homeland security. But we \ncannot ask our firefighters, emergency personnel, and law enforcement \nofficers to assume these new national responsibilities without also \nproviding new Federal support.\n  The First Responders Partnership Grant Act will provide the necessary \nFederal support for our State and public safety officers to serve as \nfull partners in the fight to protect our homeland security.

Mr. President, today, thousands of American \nathletes are training for the ultimate goal of participating in the \n2004 summer Olympic Games in Athens Greece. Americans will have to wait \nuntil next summer to applaud their efforts, but we can start applauding \nanother Olympic star today--Nadia Weinberg.\n  A Michigan native, Ms. Weinberg is a member of the Orchestra of \nAthens and she deserves a gold medal for her beautiful voice and her \ncommitment to helping those who are less fortunate than she.\n  In order to celebrate the games' return to Greece, the Orchestra of \nAthens and Ms. Weinberg will conduct a world tour including a 15-city \ntour in America. They will visit New York City, Washington D.C., \nBoston, and Detroit to name a few. Each concert will benefit a number \nof charitable organizations: children's abuse centers, college \nscholarship funds, soup kitchens, homeless shelters, and children's \nhospitals. Ms. Weinberg and the Orchestra of Athens are using their \ngift of music to help spread the goodwill of the Olympic Games here in \nAmerica and around the world.\n  We can all be proud that Ms. Weinberg is representing her country \nwith such grace. She has performed in music halls around the world, \nimpressed audiences in Carnegie Hall, the Kennedy Center, and filled \nthe Rotunda of the Capitol with her voice. Each performance shows that \nthe arts have always been a bridge of understanding between cultures.\n  I can think of no finer American--one who is dedicated to helping \nothers, committed to the arts, and determined to encourage goodwill \naround the world--than Ms. Weinberg. We are proud of her \naccomplishments and her participation in this endeavor with the \nOrchestra of Athens, and we are honored that she is representing the \nUnited States around the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/26/senate-section/article/S2835-3", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2835-S2836]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HONORING MARION HIGH SCHOOL\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, on April 26, 2003, more than 1,200 \nstudents from across the United States will visit Washington, DC to \ncompete in the national finals of the We the People: The Citizen and \nthe Constitution program, the most extensive educational program in the \ncountry developed specifically to educate young people about\n\n[[Page S2836]]\n\nthe Constitution and the Bill of Rights. Administered by the Center for \nCivic Education, the We the People program is funded by the U.S. \nDepartment of Education by act of Congress.\n  I am proud to announce that the class from Marion High School will \nrepresent the State of South Dakota in this national event. These young \nscholars have worked conscientiously to reach the national finals by \nparticipating at local and statewide competitions. As a result of their \nexperience they have gained a deep knowledge and understanding of the \nfundamental principles and values of our constitutional democracy.\n  The 3-day We the People national competition is modeled after \nhearings in the United States Congress. The hearings consist of oral \npresentations by high school students before a panel of adult judges on \nconstitutional topics. The students are given an opportunity to \ndemonstrate their knowledge while they evaluate, take, and defend \npositions on relevant historical and contemporary issues. Their \ntestimony is followed by a period of questioning by the judges who \nprobe the students' depth of understanding and ability to apply their \nconstitutional knowledge.\n  The We the People program provides curricular materials at upper \nelementary, middle, and high school levels. The curriculum not only \nenhances students' understanding of the institutions of American \nconstitutional democracy, it also helps them identify the contemporary \nrelevance of the Constitution and Bill of Rights. Critical thinking \nexercises, problem-solving activities, and cooperative learning \ntechniques help develop participatory skills necessary for students to \nbecome active, responsible citizens.\n  The class from Marion High School is currently preparing for their \nparticipation in the national competition in Washington, DC. It is \ninspiring to see these young people advocate the fundamental ideals and \nprinciples of our government, ideas that identify us as a people and \nbind us together as a nation. It is important for future generations to \nunderstand these values and principles which we hold as standards in \nour endeavor to preserve and realize the promise of our constitutional \ndemocracy. I wish these young ``constitutional experts'' the best of \nluck at the We the People national finals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/26/senate-section/article/S2836-1", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2836]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HONORING ALBERT W.

Sisk of Hopkinsville, KY. \nEarlier this month, Mr. Sisk was honored as Kentucky's nominee for the \n2003 TIME Magazine Quality Dealer Award at the National Automobile \nDealers Association convention.\n  Mr. Sisk is the president and dealer principle of Sisk Auto Mall \nlocated in Hopkinsville. One of the most distinguishing features of Mr. \nSisk's business philosophy is his commitment to family. Mr. Sisk is a \nsecond-generation car dealer and he contributes his success to the \nknowledge he gained from working alongside his father, a torch he now \npasses to his son who is General Manager of Sisk Auto Mall.\n  Mr. Sisk is certainly no stranger to community involvement. Aside \nfrom his current service in the private sector, Mr. Sisk once served \nhis country as a member of the United States Army upon graduation from \nthe University of Kentucky in 1965. Now he focuses his attention on \nhelping young adults excel in academics and their future careers. He is \nan active member of the YMCA, Rotary Club, First Christian Church and \nthe Elizabeth Stone Educational Fund Advisory Board.\n  Business and personal honors aside, Mr. Sisk cites having the \nopportunity to work with his father the most rewarding aspect of his \ncareer. It is not often we have the chance to honor such a \ndistinguished business man, community member, and family man. Please \njoin me in congratulating Mr. Albert W.

KILLEY\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to express my \nprofound appreciation for the work MG Philip G. Killey has provided as \nthe adjutant general for the South Dakota National Guard. General \nKilley has announced that he will be retiring after 40 years of \nservice, and I would like to take this opportunity to thank him for the \nextraordinary work he has done for this country and for the South \nDakota National Guard.\n  General Killey reports that South Dakota has continued its high \nrankings in terms of readiness of its National Guard units. South \nDakota's units also excel in the quality of its new recruits. I commend \nthe South Dakota National Guard for its continued excellence, and \nGeneral Killey for his leadership, which has led to the maintenance of \nthis high standard. National rankings only confirm the quality that has \ncome to be expected of the National Guard of a great State.\n  Most South Dakotans know at least 1 of the 4,500 current members of \nthe South Dakota National Guard or the thousands of former guardsmen. \nSometimes, the connection is even more direct. My oldest son Brooks was \na proud member of the South Dakota Army National Guard in Yankton prior \nto his active duty service with the U.S. Army.\n  Every community in my State benefits from the work of these \nguardsmen. Following the tradegies of September 11, guardsmen were \ncalled to assist in the campaign against terrorism and performed \nsecurity duties at airports around the State. From Aberdeen to Yankton, \nthe Guard is a key member of the South Dakota community.\n  In addition to the support the National Guard provides to South \nDakota, it has also supported overseas operations including those in \nCentral America, the Middle East, Europe, and Asia. Units around the \nState have been activated this year, deploying to military bases across \nour country and around the world.\n  These latest activities, and the professionalism that our South \nDakota National Guardsmen have shown, are a testimony to the leadership \nof General Killey. Before becoming the adjutant general in 1998, \nGeneral Killey served with distinction in both the active duty and in \nthe South Dakota National Guard.\n  General Killey received his commission in 1963 through Officer \nTraining School, at Lackland AFB in Texas. He served a tour in \nSoutheast Asia in 1967-1968 flying the F-4 with the 8th Tactical \nFighter Wing at Ubon Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand. He left \nactive duty in 1969 and joined the Air National Guard in 1970. He held \nvarious positions with the South Dakota Air National Guard before \nbecoming the adjutant general. He was recalled to active duty as \ndirector of the Air National Guard from 1988 until 1994. General Killey \nwas the first guardsman to serve as commander, 1st Air Force, Air \nCombat Command, and Continental United States North American Aerospace \nDefense Command Region, Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida, from 1994 \nuntil 1998.\n  I enthusiastically commend General Killey for his many years of \nservice, and thank him for all that he has done for this Nation and for \nour great State of South Dakota. I wish him and his wife Ellen all the \nvery best as they move on to new challenges and opportunities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/26/senate-section/article/S2836-3", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2836-S2837]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO KING DAVID HOLMES, SR.\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the late \nKing David Holmes, Sr., a life-long resident and civil rights leader \nfrom the city of Waterbury, CT.\n  ``King David,'' as he was affectionately known, was born and raised \nin Waterbury. After graduating from Crosby High School in 1940, he \nserved in the Army during World War II. Returning to Waterbury after \nhis tour of duty, King David worked at Scoville Manufacturing for 30 \nyears, retiring as a shop foreman. He also spent 11 years working for \nthe former Connecticut Department of Human Resources, now known as the \nDepartment of Social Services.\n  As the civil rights movement came to its own in the late 1950s and \nearly 1960s, King David quickly became a local leader in advocating the \nneeds of Waterbury's African-American community. He organized marches \nand protests against businesses and schools in the city practicing \ndiscrimination. He also founded the Waterbury Black Democratic Club and \nchaired New Opportunities for Waterbury, Inc., which\n\n[[Page S2837]]\n\nsuccessfully financed the construction of new housing for low-income \nindividuals and families in North Square.\n  As a member of the Waterbury Democratic Town Committee, King David \nsought to organize the city's African-American community politically. \nHe strongly promoted local and State African-American political leaders \nand worked on the Senatorial campaigns of Abraham Ribicoff and my \nfather, Thomas Dodd, both of whom fully supported equal rights. In this \nregard, I am pleased to say that my family has greatly cherished the \nfriendship and support of this fine man and his family.\n  King David was known for his open mind and willingness to work with \nall people for a better Waterbury and a better America. He will be \nsadly missed. But his social and political contributions will have a \nlasting impact for many years to come.\n  King David was predeceased by his daughter, Muriel. He is survived by \nthree children, Patricia, Maria, and King David, Jr., by Erlynde Holmes \nDePina, and by ten grandchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/26/senate-section/article/S2837-1", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2837]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 3:53 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \nagreed to the following concurrent resolution, in which it requests the \nconcurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.

Instead, \nFederal budget experts now predict a deficit of more than $2 trillion \nfor those years, the worst fiscal reversal in our history.\n  Where did the money go?\n  Obviously, the current economic slowdown has had an impact insofar as \nit has caused a drop in Federal receipts. However, much of the surplus \nwas lost to an enormous tax bill that contained mostly tax breaks for \nthe largest companies and most affluent individuals, which was enacted \nduring the spring of 2001.\n  And now, to make matters worse, the President is calling for more tax \nbreaks, again, mostly to be enjoyed by the wealthy, which Federal \nbudget experts estimate will cost $1.5 trillion over the next decade.\n  At the same time, the President has proposed to severely weaken our \nNation's efforts on behalf of families and children, particularly poor \nfamilies with children.\n  I listened to the President call for a more compassionate America in \nhis State of the Union Address. Little did I expect that he was calling \nfor others to be compassionate so that he would not have to be.\n  The budget that we received from the President earlier this month is \nthe worst I have seen for families with children in decades.\n  Despite the fact that millions of parents struggle with the cost of \nchild care, that the majority of States have long waiting lists, and \nthat we vastly need to improve the quality of care, the President \nproposes to freeze child care assistance in each of the next five \nyears.\n  At the same time, the President proposes to increase the number of \nhours that parents on welfare are required to work and increase the \noverall number of parents on welfare who are required to work. All of \nthis is without a dime more for child care.\n  Who is going to watch these children? It is an undeniable fact that \nadditional work requirements will cause an increase in the amount of \nchild care parents need. And, additional hours of child care cost \nmoney.\n  The risk is that States will rob Peter to pay Paul. They will shift \nchild care assistance from the working poor, many of whom might be \nformer welfare recipients, to help those on welfare meet their child \ncare costs. This makes no sense.\n  For Head Start, the President proposes a modest increase, barely \nenough to cover inflation despite the fact that Head Start reaches only \n60 percent of eligible 3- and 4-year-old children and only 3 percent of \neligible infants and toddlers.\n  In lieu of a real expansion in the program, the President proposes \ngiving current Head Start funds used by community programs to States. \nThis would mean that after 38 years of success, Head Start would no \nlonger be a national program, with national performance standards, \noffering comprehensive services to our Nation's poorest children--those \nmost likely to be struggling once in school.\n  Head Start works. Study after study shows the gains Head Start \nchildren make. Since Head Start graduates make up only 8 percent of \nincoming kindergarten students, it makes no sense to raid the Head \nStart money to reach the other 92 percent of children who are not in \nHead Start. And yet, that could very well be the result of the \nPresident's proposal.\n  What we know in our country is that many of our young people need a \nsafe place to go after school, particularly at-risk youth who would \notherwise be likely to go home alone, where in the absence of adult \nsupervision, they are more likely to smoke, drink, have sex, or engage \nin crime. And yet, the President proposes to cut the 21st Century \nafter-school program by $400 million. That cut would cause some 570,000 \nchildren to be discharged next year from after-school programs across \nAmerica.\n  The President proposes deep cuts in Federal housing assistance, \nallowing States to receive foster care as a block grant instead of \nindividual payments based on children actually in foster care, and \npotentially eliminating health insurance for millions of children \nthrough a block grant of Medicaid and the State Children's Health \nInsurance Program.\n  At the same time, according to the National Governor's Association, \nState economies are on the whole in the worst shape since World War II. \nStates are operating with billions of dollars in the red with State \nconstitutional requirements to balance their budgets.\n  It is clear what is going on here.\n  Instead of providing more resources to help States during these tough \ntimes, the President is raiding poverty programs for children and using \nthat money to help pay for tax benefits for those who are at the very \ntop of the income scale. This reckless policy only worsens the budget \nshortfalls facing so many States.\n  Children are one-quarter of our population. But, they are 100 percent \nof our future. It makes no sense to shortchange our investment in \nchildren.\n\n[[Page S2841]]\n\n  America's children today are living under some staggering challenges. \nNearly 12 million children live in poverty; over 9 million children \nhave no health coverage; about 7 million children go home alone each \nweek after school; and, nearly 1 million children are abused and \nneglected.\n  We can do better for our children. We should do better for children. \nWe don't need another tax break for America's wealthiest citizens. What \nwe need is a sound investment in our Nation's children.\n  The legislation we are introducing today is called, ``An Act to Leave \nNo Child Behind.'' We are committed to this one principle beyond all \nothers. Not just a slogan, but as a means to define an urgent national \npriority.\n  We need to make sure that we not only talk about leaving no child \nbehind, but that we actually take steps to do so. Introducing this bill \nis the first such step.\n  Every word on every page is focused on the same purpose--lifting our \nchildren up, giving each child an opportunity, helping each child to \nhave a safe and rewarding life.\n  Under the Act to Leave No Child Behind, every child in America would \nhave health coverage. No child in America would go to bed at night \naching from hunger. We would use our tax code to lift millions of \nchildren out of poverty--not provide more hand-outs for the most \nwealthy in this country.\n  It's time to ensure that every American child has an opportunity to \nattend Head Start, Pre-K, or quality child care to begin a lifetime of \nlearning. It's time to ensure that every American child can read by 4th \ngrade, and read at grade level. And, it's time to take dramatic new \nsteps to address the needs of children who are abused and neglected \nevery year.\n  Budget experts predict that the President's tax plan will give \nmillionaires an average tax break of $88,800 each. For that same amount \nof money, we could fully fund Head Start and provide health insurance \nto every one of the 9 million uninsured children.\n  We have the resources. If we can afford to give $88,800 on average to \nevery millionaire, then the question is really about priorities and \npolitical will--not resources.\n  If we join together, we can transform this Nation and give each and \nevery child his God-given right to grow and flourish to all he can be, \nto his or her fullest potential so that all children can realize their \ndreams.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have a summary of the bill printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    The Act to Leave No Child Behind\n\n       The Act to Leave No Child Behind is a comprehensive bill \n     that will benefit every child in America. The measure \n     represents a vision of what we can do for children if we \n     really want to move beyond talking about leaving no child \n     behind to taking steps to actually leave no child behind. \n     Each of the bill's twelve titles seeks to improve the lives \n     of children so that they can reach their fullest potential.\n\n\n               Title I: Every Child Needs a Healthy Start\n\n       Over 9 million children throughout America have no health \n     insurance today. Under the Act to Leave No Child Behind, all \n     uninsured children would receive health care coverage.\n\n\n     Title II: Parenting--Supporting Children's Healthy Development\n\n       Too many parents throughout America struggle to balance \n     work, family, and the needs of their children. Under the Act \n     to Leave No Child Behind, the Family and Medical Leave Act \n     would be expanded to cover more employees, create pilot \n     demonstrations to offer paid leave, and allocate grants to \n     states to provide parenting support and education.\n\n\n             Title III: Child Care, Head Start, & Education\n\n       Research on brain development during the first three years \n     of life makes clear the need for quality early childhood \n     development. Yet, only one out of every seven eligible \n     children receives child care assistance and the quality of \n     child care that children receive needs to be vastly improved. \n     Head Start reaches only 60 percent of eligible 3 and 4 year \n     olds and only 3 percent of infants and toddlers. Full funding \n     for child care and 3 & 4 year-olds in Head Start would ensure \n     that all children eligible for assistance can receive it.\n       Title IV: Tax Relief for Low-Wage Working Families; Title \n     V: Moving Out of Poverty\n       Tax relief under current law is limited for low income \n     families. The Act to Leave No Child Behind will increase the \n     child tax credit, expand the Earned Income Tax Credit and the \n     Dependent Tax Credit, and reduce the marriage penalty for low \n     income families. Nearly 12 million children live in poverty \n     in America today; about 78 percent of them live in working \n     families. The Act to Leave No Child Behind includes supports \n     for hard working parents to remain employed and to help lift \n     themselves and their children out of poverty.\n\n\n Title VI: Getting Enough to Eat; Title VII: Affording a Place to Live\n\n       The Department of Agriculture estimates that nearly 13 \n     million children live in families not getting enough to eat, \n     including nearly 3 million children who regularly go hungry. \n     The Act to Leave No Child Behind will expand food assistance \n     to low income families with children. The fastest growing \n     group among those with ``worst case housing needs'' includes \n     families with children. The Act to Leave No Child Behind will \n     increase the means for states to ensure that families with \n     children have a decent, affordable place to live.\n\n\n               Title VIII: Every Child Needs a Safe Start\n\n       Every day, nearly 8,000 children are reported to public \n     child protection agencies as suspected victims of child \n     abuse. In too many states, the child protection system is \n     stretched to its breaking point. The Act to Leave No Child \n     Behind will help to ensure that more children are in safe, \n     nurturing, and permanent families.\n\n\nTitle IX: Successful Transitions to Adulthood--Youth Development; Title \n                          X: Juvenile Justice\n\n       Nearly 7 million children go home alone unsupervised each \n     week after school. The Act to Leave No Child Behind will \n     provide increased funding for after-school and youth \n     development programs. While juvenile crime rates have been \n     declining since 1994, still too many children come into \n     contact with the law. The Act to Leave No Child Behind will \n     provide funding for delinquency prevention programs and will \n     enable more at-risk youth to become productive, law-abiding \n     adults.\n\n\n                          Title XI: Gun Safety\n\n       The most recent annual data shows that over 3,300 children \n     and teens in America were killed by gunfire, including about \n     one-third who committed suicide. The Act to Leave No Child \n     Behind will close existing loopholes in our nation's gun law \n     and promote child safety.\n\n\n    Title XII: Every Child Needs the Support of the Entire Community\n\n       The Act to Leave No Child Behind will establish a blue-\n     ribbon commission to identify family-friendly practices that \n     the private sector can replicate and promote.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. HUTCHISON:\n  S. 449. A bill to authorize the President to agree to certain \namendments to the Agreement Between the Government of the United States \nof America and the Government of the United Mexican States Concerning \nthe Establishment of a Border Environment Cooperation Commission and a \nNorth American Development Bank; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text \nof the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 449\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for \nresearch on, and services for individuals\n\n[[Page S2842]]\n\nwith, postpartum depression and psychosis; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Melanie \nStokes Postpartum Depression Research and Care Act along with Senator \nFitzgerald and Senator Clinton.\n  My legislation is named after a Chicago native who struggled \nunsuccessfully against postpartum psychosis following the birth of her \ndaughter. While fighting this debilitating mental condition Ms. Stokes \nhas been in and out of hospitals several times, stopped eating and \ndrinking, and wouldn't swallow pills. Despite medical assistance and \nthe support of her family and friends, Mrs. Stokes was ultimately \nunable to overcome her condition, and jumped to her death from a 12-\nstory window ledge.\n  Studies indicate that 50 to 75 percent of all new mothers experience \nthe ``baby blues,'' a feeling of moderate emotional distress following \nchildbirth. Serious postpartum depression on the other hand, affects \nbetween 10 and 20 percent of women. In Illinois alone there are at \nleast 180,000 births a year. Even using the conservative estimate that \n10 percent of mothers will suffer from postpartum depression, this \nsuggests that over 18,000 women, in the State of Illinois alone will \nexperience the devastating symptoms of this disorder each year. Women \nsuffering from serious postpartum depression may worry excessively or \nfind themselves exhausted. They may experience sadness, feelings of \nguilt, apathy, phobias, or sleep problems sometimes for as long as 3 to \n14 months. Understanding this disorder more fully and developing new \ntreatments should be a top priority.\n  The most severe form of mental illness that can affect women \nfollowing childbirth is postpartum psychosis. Although this condition \nis more difficult to recognize since it occurs less frequently than \npostpartum depression, the consequences of allowing postpartum \npsychosis to go untreated are serious. Postpartum psychosis is \ncharacterized by hallucinations, hearing voices, paranoia, severe \ninsomnia, extreme anxiety and depression and women suffering from the \ndisorder are at increased risk for suicide or harming others.\n  Even though many new mothers will experience some form of postpartum \ndepression or the ``baby blues,'' few research studies are carefully \nexamining the causes of this mental condition at present. In addition, \nthere is currently no standard treatment for women suffering from \npostpartum depression. The Melanie Stokes Postpartum Depression \nResearch and Care Act would develop a coordinated approach for \nunderstanding and treating this devastating illness.\n  Specifically, my legislation authorizes the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services to organize a series of national meetings that focus on \ndeveloping a consensus research and treatment plan for postpartum \ndepression and psychosis. The Melanie Stokes Postpartum Depression \nResearch and Care Act also encourages the Secretary to implement the \nconsensus research and treatment plan generated via the national meting \nseries in a timely fashion. Finally, the bill makes grant funding \navailable through the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services \nAdministration to aid in the delivery of treatment services for \npostpartum depression to women and their families.\n  I am pleased that Senator Fitzgerald and Senator Clinton have joined \nme in introducing this important legislation. Congressman Rush has \ntaken the lead in the House of Representatives. I am anxious to work in \na bipartisan, bicameral fashion to coordinate our approach toward \nunderstanding postpartum depression by passing this legislation in \nremembrance of Melanie Stokes and all the women who have suffered from \npostpartum depression and psychosis.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE:\n  S. 451. A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to increase the \nminimum Survivor Benefit Plan basic annuity for surviving spouses age \n62 and older, to provide for a one-year open season under that plan, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nwill correct an injustice being visited upon the survivors of our \nservicemembers killed in action and military retirees under the current \nmilitary Survivor's Benefit Plan, or SBP.\n  As the program currently operates, the widows or widowers of those \nwho have ``borne the battle'' receive an annuity equal to 55 percent of \nthe servicemember's retirement pay. That is, until they turn 62. At \nthat time, under current law, a surviving spouse's SBP benefits must be \nreduced either by a Social Security offset, or a reduction in payments \nto 35 percent of retired pay--a drop of almost 40 percent--simply \nbecause they have reached the age of 62.\n  For example, let's take the widow of a Navy chief petty officer or E-\n7 who had served 20 years before retiring. Before she reaches 62, this \nwidow will receive $771 per month, but on her 62nd birthday, that \nbenefit drops to only $491 per month--a loss of $3,360 per year.\n  For a retired O-5, say a Marine Corps lieutenant colonel, the widow's \nbenefit would drop by $6,960 a year as soon as she turns 62. Some \nbirthday gift.\n  But the inequities don't stop there. For example, the military \nSurvivor Benefit Plan does not measure up to the Federal Survivor \nBenefit Plan in terms of benefits paid to survivors. Survivors of \nFederal civilian retirees under the original Civil Service Retirement \nSystem receive 55 percent of their spouse's retired pay for life--with \nno drop in benefits at age 62. Under the newer Federal Employee \nRetirement System, survivors still receive 50 percent of retired pay \nfor life, again with no drop at age 62.\n  Yet another reason that we should adopt this legislation is that \nmembers of the military pay more than their share of Survivor Benefit \nPlan program costs, as compared to their Federal civilian counterparts.\n  Originally, the Congress intended the government to subsidize 40 \npercent of the cost of military Survivor Benefit Plan premiums--similar \nto the government's contribution to the Federal civilian plan. Over the \nlast several decades, however, there has been a significant decline in \nthe government's cost share, and Department of Defense actuaries advise \nthat the government subsidy is now down to less than 17 percent. This \nmeans that military retirees are now paying more than 83 percent of \nprogram costs from their retired pay versus the intended 60 percent.\n  Contrast this to the Federal civilian SBP, which has a 52 percent \ncost share for those under the Civil Service Retirement System and a 67 \npercent cost share for those employees, including many of our own \nstaff, under the Federal Employees Retirement System. While it is true \nthat there are differences between the civilian and military premium \ncosts, with Federal civilians paying more, it is also true that \nmilitary retirees generally retire earlier than their Federal civilian \ncounterparts, and as a result, pay premiums for many more years.\n  This legislation is intended to raise, over a five year period, the \npercentage of the retirement annuity received by the survivor from 35 \npercent to 55 percent after age 62. The first year, 2004, will be an \nopen season to allow new enrollees to sign up for the program in order \nto reduce retired pay outlays by increasing deductions of SBP premiums \nfrom retired pay, thus offsetting part of the cost of the survivor \nbenefit increase.\n  Beginning on Oct. 1, 2004, the second year, the age-62 SBP annuity \nwould increase to 40 percent of retired pay, followed by an additional \nincrease to 45 percent in 2005, 50 percent in 2006 and 55 percent in \n2007 after which all survivors would receive the 55 percent of the \nannuity.\n  Once again, I ask my colleagues to support our Nation's military \nwidows and widowers. In the National Defense Authorization Act of 2001, \nwe included a Sense of the Congress on increasing the military SBP \nannuity. This year, we have a chance to carry out this intent by \nenacting this important measure, and I ask my colleagues to join with \nme in support of this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for himself and Mr. Ensign):\n  S. 452. A bill to require that the Secretary of the Interior conduct \na study to identify sites and resources, to recommend alternatives for \ncommemorating and interpreting the Cold War,\n\n[[Page S2843]]\n\nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Cold War was the longest war in United \nStates history. Lasting 50 years, the Cold War cost thousands of lives, \ntrillions of dollars, changed the course of history, and left America \nthe only superpower in the world. Because of the nuclear capabilities \nof our enemy it was the most dangerous conflict our country ever faced. \nThe threat of mass destruction left a permanent mark on American life \nand politics. Those that won this war did so in obscurity. Those that \ngave their lives in the Cold War have never been properly honored.\n  Today I introduce with Senator Ensign a bill that requires the \nDepartment of the Interior to conduct a study to identify sites and \nresources to commemorate heroes of the Cold War and to interpret the \nCold War for future generations.\n  Our legislation directs the Secretary of the Interior to establish a \n``Cold War Advisory Committee'' to oversee the inventory of Cold War \nsites and resources for potential inclusion in the National Park \nSystem, as national historic landmarks, or other appropriate \ndesignations.\n  The Advisory Committee will work closely with State and local \ngovernments and local historical organizations. The committee's \nstarting point will be a Cold War study completed by the Secretary of \nDefense under the 1991 Defense Appropriations Act Obvious Cold War \nsites of significance include: Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles, \nflight training centers, communications and command centers, such as \nCheyenne Mountain, Colorado, nuclear weapons test sites, such as the \nNevada test site, and strategic and tactical resources.\n  Perhaps no other state in the Union has played a more significant \nrole than Nevada in winning the Cold War. The Nevada Test Site is a \nhigh-technology engineering marvel where the United States developed, \ntested, and perfected a nuclear deterrent which is the cornerstone of \nAmerica's security and leadership among nations. The Naval Air Station \nat Fallon is the Navy's premiere tactical air warfare training \nfacility. The Air Warfare Center at Nellis Air Force Base has the \nlargest training range in the United States to ensure that America's \npilots will prevail in any armed conflict.\n  The Advisory Committee established under this legislation will \ndevelop an interpretive handbook on the Cold War to tell the story of \nthe Cold War and its heroes.\n  I would like to take a moment to relate a story of one group of Cold \nWar heroes. On a snowy evening in November 17, 1955, a United States \nAir Force C-54 crashed near the summit of Mount Charleston in central \nNevada. The doomed flight was carrying 15 scientific and technical \npersonnel to secret Area 51 where the U-2 reconnaissance plane, of \nFrancis Powers fame, was being developed under tight security. The men \naboard the ill-fated C-54 helped build the plane which critics said \ncould never be built. The critics were wrong--the U-2 is a vital part \nof our reconnaissance force to this day.\n  The secrecy of the mission was so great that the families of the men \nwho perished on Mount Charleston only recently learned about the true \ncircumstances of the crash that took the lives of their loved ones. My \nlegislation will provide $300,000 to identify historic landmarks like \nthe crash at Mount Charleston.\n  I'd like to thank Mr. Steve Ririe of Las Vegas who brought to light \nthe events surrounding the death of the fourteen men who perished on \nMount Charleston nearly a half century ago, and for the efforts of \nState Senator Rawson who shepherded a resolution through the Nevada \nlegislature to commemorate these heroes.\n  A grateful Nation owes its gratitude to the ``Silent Heroes of the \nCold War.'' We urge our colleagues to support this long overdue tribute \nto the contribution and sacrifice of those Cold War heroes for the \ncause of freedom.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. HUTCHISON (for herself, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Cochran, and \n        Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 453. A bill to authorize the Health Resources and Services \nAdministration and the National Cancer Institute to make grants for \nmodel programs to provide to individuals of health disparity \npopulations prevention, early detection, treatment, and appropriate \nfollow-up care services for cancer and chronic diseases, and to make \ngrants regarding patient navigators to assist individuals of health \ndisparity populations in receiving such services; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation \ntoday that will reduce barriers to health care for millions of patients \nacross the country, particularly those from medically underserved and \nminority communities. The Patient Navigator, Outreach, and Chronic \nDisease Prevention Act will create programs which direct individuals to \naffordable and accessible prevention, detection and treatment services \nfor cancer and other chronic diseases. The bill will also establish \npatient navigator programs to assist patients make their way through \nthe often complex health care system.\n  This year alone, more than 80,000 Texans will be diagnosed with \ncancer and nearly 35,000 Texans will die of the disease. Cancer is the \nmost expensive illness in the United States. It cost Texas $13.9 \nbillion in one year due to medical costs and loss of productivity in \n1998.\n  Despite the tremendous progress that has been made in cancer and \nchronic disease prevention, detection, and treatment, not all Americans \nare benefitting. Cancer survival rates of those living in poverty are \nten to fifteen percent lower than other Americans, and African American \nmen have the lowest rate of cancer survival. Cancer and chronic disease \ncontinue to disproportionately impact minorities and medically \nunderserved communities. The consequences of inadequate access to these \nservices mean that diseases like cancer are often diagnosed at later \nstages when the illness is more advanced and options for treatment are \ndecreased.\n  In my home State of Texas, ensuring access to health care is a \nprofound challenge, particularly along the Texas-Mexico border. The \nproblem is in part due to lack of insurance coverage, as forty-nine \npercent of the Texas Hispanic population does not have health \ninsurance, but it is also attributable to an uneven distribution of \nhealth professionals and hospitals, inadequate transportation, and a \nshortage of bilingual health information and providers.\n  The legislation I am introducing today will eliminate barriers by \ncutting through red tape and increasing access to affordable prevention \nand care for people from all walks of life.\n  The bill accomplishes its goals by reaching patients in the \ncommunities in which they live--through community health centers, rural \nhealth clinics, community hospitals, cancer centers, tribal and urban \nIndian organizations, among others, and by ensuring that there is a \ndoctor or nurse, who, while speaking in a language people can \nunderstand, will provide patients with prevention screenings and \nfollow-up treatment.\n  Patients will be provided with a trained patient navigator from their \nown community, who can help with scheduling and keeping appointments \nand referrals for prevention and treatment. They can also ensure \ndoctor's instructions are followed and funds to pay for treatment or \narranging transportation to a specialist are obtained. They may also \nprovide a service as simple as helping out with the paperwork.\n  This legislation is modeled after successful programs such as the \nHarlem Navigator Program at Harlem Hospital in New York City operated \nby Dr. Harold Freeman, and the local Washington, D.C. Hospital Cancer \nPreventorium directed by Dr. Elmer Huerta. Through implementation of \nthe Harlem patient navigator program, diagnosis of breast cancer at an \nearly stage has improved. In 1989, only 1 out of 20 breast cancer \ndiagnoses were made at an early stage. Now, through the navigator \nprogram, 4 out of every 10 diagnoses are identified early. Furthermore, \nthe program has reduced the time between diagnosis and treatment to ten \ndays.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass the critically \nimportant Patient Navigator, Outreach and Chronic Disease Prevention \nAct.\n\n[[Page S2844]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 453\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Patient Navigator, Outreach, \n     and Chronic Disease Prevention Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Despite notable progress in the overall health of the \n     Nation, there are continuing disparities in the burden of \n     illness and death experienced by African Americans, Latinos \n     and Hispanics, Native Americans, Alaska Natives, Asian and \n     Pacific Islanders and the poor, compared to the United States \n     population as a whole.\n       (2) Many racial and ethnic minority groups suffer \n     disproportionately from cancer. Mortality and morbidity rates \n     remain the most important measures of the overall progress \n     against cancer. Decreasing rates of death from cancer reflect \n     improvements in both prevention and treatment. Among all \n     ethnic groups in the United States, African American males \n     have the highest overall rate of mortality from cancer. Some \n     specific forms of cancer affect other ethnic minority \n     communities at rates up to several times higher than the \n     national averages (such as stomach and liver cancers among \n     Asian American populations, colon and rectal cancer among \n     Alaska natives, and cervical cancer among Hispanic and \n     Vietnamese-American women).\n       (3) Regions characterized by high rates of poverty also \n     have high mortality for some forms of cancer. For example, in \n     Appalachian Kentucky the incidence of lung cancer among white \n     males was 127 per 100,000 in 1992, a rate higher than that \n     for any ethnic minority group in the United States during the \n     same period.\n       (4) Major disparities for other chronic diseases exist \n     among population groups, with a disproportionate burden of \n     death and disability from cardiovascular disease in racial \n     and ethnic minority and low-income populations. Compared with \n     rates for the general population, coronary heart disease \n     mortality was 40 percent lower for Asian Americans but 40 \n     percent higher for African-Americans.\n       (5) Minority populations are disproportionately impacted by \n     diabetes and other chronic diseases. Hispanics are twice as \n     likely to have diabetes as non-Hispanic whites; diabetes is \n     the fourth leading cause of death among Hispanic women and \n     elderly. African Americans are 1.7 times as likely to have \n     diabetes as the general population. More than 15% of the \n     combined populations of Native Americans and Alaska Natives \n     have diabetes.\n       (6) Culturally competent approaches to chronic disease care \n     are needed to encourage increased participation of racial and \n     ethnic minorities and the medically underserved in chronic \n     disease prevention, early detection and treatment programs.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to remove the limitation on the use of funds to \nrequire a farm to feed livestock with organically produced feed to be \ncertified as an organic farm; to the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I am proud to introduce with Senator \nSnowe a bipartisan bill that will repeal a rider in the Omnibus \nAppropriations Conference Report. After the Conference Committee met \nand behind closed doors, this special interest rider gutted the organic \nstandards just recently enacted by U.S. Department of Agriculture. \nThirty four Senators, and counting, from both parties are joining me to \nrepeal this special interest provision and restore credibility to the \nUSDA organic standards.\n  I understand this special interest provision was inserted into the \nbill on behalf of a single producer who essentially wants to hijack the \n``organic'' certification label for his own purposes. He wants to get a \nmarket premium for his products, without actually being an organic \nproduct.\n  This provision will allow producers to label their meat and dairy \nproducts ``organic'' even though they do not meet the strict criteria \nset forth by USDA, including the requirement that the animals be fed \norganically grown feed. This approach was considered and outright \nrejected by USDA last June. The entire organic industry opposed this \nweakening of the organic standards. If beef, poultry, pork and dairy \nproducers are able to label their products as ``organic'' without using \norganic feed, which is one of the primary inputs, then what exactly is \norganic about the product?\n  This provision is particularly galling because so many producers have \nalready made the commitment to organic production. For most, this is a \nhuge financial commitment on their part. I have already heard from some \nlarge producers--General Mills, Tyson Foods--as well as scores of \nfarmers from Vermont and around the country who are enraged by this \nspecial loophole included for one company that does not want to play by \nthe rules.\n  My legislation strikes this rider from the Omnibus Appropriations Act \nand I hope to move it through Congress quickly before it does gut the \norganic meat and dairy industry. We need to send a message to all \nproducers that if you want to benefit from the organic standards \neconomically, you must actually meet them. When I included the ``The \nOrganic Foods Production Act'' in the 1990 farm bill, it was because \nfarmers recognized the growing consumer demand for organically produced \nproducts, but needed a tool to help consumers know which products were \ntruly organic and which were not. The Act directed USDA to set minimum \nnational standards for products labeled ``organic'' so that consumers \ncould make informed buying decisions. The national standard also \nreassured farmers selling organically produced products that they would \nnot have to follow separate rules in each state, and that their \nproducts could be labeled ``organic'' overseas.\n  The new standards have been enthusiastically welcomed by consumers, \nbecause through organic labeling they now can know what they are \nchoosing and paying for when they shop. This proposal to weaken the \norganic standards would undermine public confidence in organic \nlabeling, which is less than a year old.\n  Getting the organic standards that are behind the ``USDA Organic'' \nlabel right was a long and difficult process, but critically important \nto the future of the industry. Along the way, some tried to allow \nproducts treated with sewer sludge, irradiation, and antibiotics to be \nlabeled ``organic.'' The public outcry against this was overwhelming. \nMore than 325,000 people weighed in during the comment period, as did \nI. The groundswell of support for strong standards clearly showed that \nthe public wants ``organic'' to really mean something. Those efforts to \nhijack the term were defeated and this one should be too.\n  Consumers and producers rely on the standard. I hope more members \nwill cosponsor my bill and send a message to special interests that \nthey cannot hijack the organic industry through a rider on the spending \nbill. We need to fix this mistake and restore integrity to our organic \nstandards.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mrs. Hutchison, and Mrs. Boxer):\n  S. 458. A bill to establish the Southwest Regional Border Authority; \nto the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nalong with Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison that will help raise the \nstandard of living for hundreds of thousands of Americans who live near \nthe U.S.-Mexico Border. The ``Southwest Regional Border Authority Act'' \nwould create an economic development authority for the Southwest border \nregion, charged with awarding grants to border communities in support \nof their local economic development projects.\n  The need for a Regional Border Authority is acute: the poverty rate \nin the Southwest border region is 20 percent--nearly double the \nnational average; unemployment rates in Southwest border counties often \nreach as high as five times the national unemployment rate; per capita \npersonal income in the region is greatly below the national average; \nand lack of adequate access to capital has made it difficult for \nbusinesses to start up in the region.\n  In addition, the development of key infrastructures--such as water \nand wastewater, transportation, public health, and telecommunications--\nhas not kept pace with the population explosion and the increase in \ncross-border commerce.\n  The counties in the Southwest border region are among the most \neconomically distressed in the nation. In fact, there are only a few \nsuch regions of economic distress throughout the country--almost all of \nwhich are currently served by regional economic development \ncommissions. These commissions, which are authorized by Congress, \ninclude the Appalachian Regional Commission, the Delta Regional \nAuthority, and the Denali Commission. In order to address the needs of \nthe border region in a similar fashion, I propose the creation of a \nregional economic development authority for the Southwest border.\n  My bill, which is modeled after the Appalachian Regional Commission, \nis based on four guiding principles. First, it starts from the premise \nthat the people who live in the southwest border region know best when \nit comes to making decisions that affect their communities. Second, it \nemploys a regional approach to economic development and encourages \ncommunities to work across county and state lines when appropriate. All \ntoo often, past efforts to improve the Southwest border region have hit \nroadblocks as a result of poor coordination and communication between \ncommunities.\n  Third, it creates an economic development entity that is \nindependent--meaning it will be able to make decisions that are in the \nbest interest of border communities, without being subject to the \npolitics of Federal agencies. Finally, it brings together \nrepresentatives of the four Southwest border States and the Federal \nGovernment as equal partners, all of whom will work to improve the \nquality of life and standard of living for border residents.\n  This is not just another commission, and it is certainly not just \nanother grant program. I believe the Southwest Regional Border \nAuthority not only will help leverage new private sector funding, but \nalso will help better target Federal funding to those projects that are \nmost likely to achieve the desired outcome of increased economic \ndevelopment.\n  The legislation accomplishes this through a sensible mechanism of \ndevelopment planning. Under the bill, communities in each of the four \nborder States will work through ``local development districts'' to \ncreate development plans that reflect the needs and priorities specific \nto each locality. These local development plans then go to the State in \nwhich the communities are located, where they become the basis for a \nState development plan. The four State development plans, in turn, from \nthe basis for a regional development plan, which is put together by the \nAuthority. The purpose of this planning process is to ensure that local \npriorities are reflected in the projects funded by the Authority, while \nalso\n\n[[Page S2850]]\n\nproviding flexibility to the Authority to fund projects that are \nregional in nature.\n  This process has several advantages. First, by ensuring that Federal \ndollars are targeted to projects that have gone through thorough \nplanning at the local level, we will greatly improve the probability of \nsuccess for those projects--thereby increasing the Federal Government's \nreturn on its investment. Second, local development plans are essential \nto attracting private sector funding. Increased private investment \nmeans less need for Federal, State, and local public sector funding. \nThird, combining resources in such a way will help communities get more \nfunding then they can currently get from any one program. This is \nparticularly important now as we in Congress grapple with how to fund \nthe needs of the border in the current budget climate.\n  I believe there are additional benefits to be derived from the Border \nAuthority. As the only independent, quasi-Federal entity charged with \neconomic development for the entire Southwest border region, the \nAuthority will become a clearinghouse of sorts on all the funding \navailable to the border region. This will enable the Authority to help \nborder communities learn which programs are best suited to their needs \nand most likely to achieve the goals of their local development plans. \nAnother benefit is its focus on economically distressed counties. Under \nthe bill, the Authority can provide funding to increase the Federal \nshare of a federal grant program to up to 90 percent of the total cost. \nThis is particularly helpful to the many communities that are often \nunable to utilize federal funding because they can't afford the \nrequired local match.\n  For far too long the needs of the Southwest Border have been ignored, \noverlooked, or underfunded. I am confident that the creation of a \nSouthwest Regional Border Authority not only will call attention to the \ngreat needs that exist along the border, but also provide resources to \nlocal communities where the dollars will do the most good. I urge the \nSenate to move swiftly on this legislation, and I ask my colleagues for \ntheir support.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to ensure that a public safety officer who suffers a \nfatal heart attack or stroke while on duty shall be presumed to have \ndied in the line of duty for purposes of public safety officer survivor \nbenefits; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I proudly rise today to introduce the \nHometown Heroes Survivors Benefits Act of 2003. I thank Senators Graham \nof South Carolina, Collins, Jeffords, Sarbanes, Schumer, Durbin, \nLandrieu, Nelson of Florida, Clinton and Snowe for joining me as \noriginal cosponsors of this multi-partisan legislation that will \nimprove the Department of Justice's Public Safety Officers' Benefits, \nPSOB, Program by allowing families of public safety officers who suffer \nfatal heart attacks or strokes to qualify for Federal survivor \nbenefits.\n  I want to begin by thanking each of our Nation's brave firefighters, \nemergency medical rescuers and law enforcement officers for the jobs \nthey do for the American public day in and day out. Our public safety \nofficers are often the first to respond to any crime or emergency \nsituation. On September 11, the Nation saw that the first on the scene \nat the World Trade Center were the heroic firefighters, police officers \nand emergency personnel of New York City. These real-life heroes, many \nof whom gave the ultimate sacrifice, remind us of how important it is \nto support our state and local public safety partners.\n  I commend Congressmen Etheridge, Weldon, Hoyer and Oxley for their \nleadership and fortitude during the last Congress on an identical bill \nin the House. I look forward to working with them again during the \n108th Congress on this important legislation.\n  Last year, both the House and Senate versions of this legislation \nreceived the endorsement of the Fraternal Order of Police, National \nAssociation of Police Organizations, Congressional Fire Services \nInstitute, International Association of Arson Investigators, \nInternational Association of Fire Chiefs, International Association of \nFire Fighters, National Fire Protection Association, National Volunteer \nFire Council, North American Fire Training Directors, International \nFire Buff Associates, National Association of Emergency Medical \nTechnicians, American Ambulance Association, the American Federation of \nState, County and Municipal Employees, along with over 50 additional \nnational organizations. I thank all of these organizations for their \nunwavering support for this legislation.\n  Public safety officers are among our most brave and dedicated public \nservants. I applaud the efforts of all members of fire, law \nenforcement, and rescue organizations nationwide who are the first to \nrespond to more than 1.6 million emergency calls annually whether those \ncalls involve a crime, fire, medical emergency, spill of hazardous \nmaterials, natural disaster, act of terrorism, or transportation \naccident without reservation. They act with an unwavering commitment to \nthe safety and protection of their fellow citizens, and are forever \nwilling to selflessly sacrifice their own lives to provide safe and \nreliable emergency services to their communities. Sadly, this \ndedication to service can result in tragedy, as was evident by the \nbravery displayed on September 11, 2001, when scores of first \nresponders raced to the World Trade Center and the Pentagon with no \nother goal but to save lives.\n  Every year, hundreds of public safety officers nationwide lose their \nlives and thousands more are injured while performing duties that \nsubject them to great physical risks. And while we know that PSOB \nbenefits can never be a substitute for the loss of a loved one, the \nfamilies of all our fallen heroes deserve to collect these funds.\n  The PSOB Program was established in 1976 to authorize a one-time \nfinancial payment to the eligible survivors of Federal, State, and \nlocal public safety officers for all line-of-duty deaths.\n  Two years ago, Congress improved the PSOB Program by streamlining the \nprocess for families of public safety officers killed or injured in \nconnection with prevention, investigation, rescue or recovery efforts \nrelated to a terrorist attack. We also retroactively increased the \ntotal benefits available by $100,000 as part of the USA PATRIOT Act.\n  The PSOB Program currently provides approximately $262,000 in \nbenefits to the families of law enforcement officers, firemen, \nemergency response squad members, and ambulance crew members who are \nkilled in the line of duty.\n  Unfortunately, the issue of covering heart attack and stroke victims \nin the PSOB Program was not addressed at that time.\n  When establishing the PSOB Program, Congress placed only three \nlimitations on the payment of benefits. No award could be paid, first, \nif the death was caused by the intentional misconduct of the officer or \nby such officer's intention to bring about his own death; second, if \nvoluntary intoxication of the officer was the proximate cause of such \nofficer's death; or, third, to any person otherwise entitled to a \nbenefit if such person's action was a substantial contributing factor \nto the death of the officer.\n  In years following, however, the Justice Department began to \ninterpret the Program's guidelines to exclude from benefits the \nsurvivors of public safety officer who die of a heart attack or stroke \nwhile acting in the line of duty, arguing that the attack must be \naccompanied by a traumatic injury, such as a wound or other condition \nof the body caused by external force, including injuries by bullets, \nsmoke inhalation, explosives, sharp instruments, blunt objects or other \nphysical blows, chemicals, electricity, climatic conditions, infectious \ndiseases, radiation, and bacteria. Barred are those who suffer from \noccupational injuries, such as stress and strain.\n  Service-connected heart, lung, and hypertension conditions are silent \nkillers of public safety officers nationwide. The numerous hidden \nhealth dangers dealt with by police officers, firefighters and \nemergency medical personnel are widely recognized, but officers face \nthese dangers in order to carry out their sworn duty to serve and \nprotect their fellow citizens.\n  Our multi-partisan bill would effectively erase any distinction \nbetween traumatic and occupational injuries. The Hometown Heroes bill \nwill fix the loophole in the PSOB Program to ensure that the survivors \nof public safety officers who die of heart attacks or strokes in the \nline of duty or within 24 hours of a triggering effect while on duty \nregardless of whether a traumatic injury is present at the time of the \nheart attack or stroke are eligible to receive financial assistance.\n  I was serving my first term in the Senate when this program was \nestablished, and I firmly believe that this is what Congress meant for \nthe survivors of our Nation's first responders to receive through the \nPublic Safety Officers Benefits Program.\n  Heart attack and cardiac related deaths account for almost half of \nall firefighter fatalities between 45-50 deaths and an average of 13 \npolice officer deaths each year. Yet the families of these fallen \nheroes are rarely eligible to receive PSOB benefits.\n  In January 1978, special Deputy Sheriff Bernard Demag of the \nChittenden County Sheriff's Office in Vermont suffered a fatal heart \nattack within two hours of his chase and apprehension of an escaped \njuvenile whom he had been transporting. Mr. Demag's family spent nearly \ntwo decades fighting in court for workers' compensation death benefits \nall to no avail. Clearly, we should be treating surviving family \nmembers of officers who die in the line of duty with more decency and \nrespect.\n  Public safety is dangerous, exhausting, and stressful work. A first \nresponder's chances of suffering a heart attack or stroke greatly \nincrease when he or she puts on heavy equipment and rushes into a \nburning building to fight a fire and save lives. The families of these \nbrave public servants deserve to participate in the PSOB Program if \ntheir loved ones die of a heart attack or other cardiac related \nailments while selflessly protecting us from harm.\n\n[[Page S2856]]\n\n  First responders across the country now face a new series of \nchallenges as they respond to millions of emergency calls this year. \nThey do this with an unwavering commitment to the safety of their \nfellow citizens, and are forever willing to selflessly sacrifice their \nown lives to protect the lives and property of their fellow citizens. \nIt is time for the Senate to show its support and appreciation for \nthese extraordinarily brave and heroic public safety officers by \npassing the Hometown Heroes Survivors Benefit Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 459\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I have long worked with my colleagues from \nArizona and other border states to address issues, from health care to \ncrime, that are associated with illegal immigration. In the 107th \nCongress, I joined Senator Feinstein, Senator Kyl, and a bipartisan \ngroup of Senators to reauthorize the State Criminal Alien Assistance \nProgram, SCAAP, to ensure that the Federal Government reimbursed States \nfor the costs wrongly borne by local communities for the incarceration \nof undocumented immigrants. That bill was based on the premise that \ncontrol of illegal immigration is principally the responsibility of the \nFederal Government.\n  Last November, that legislation was incorporated into the 21st \nCentury Department of Justice Authorization Act. Despite its enactment, \nStates and local governments continue to disproportionately bear the \ncosts associated with incarcerating illegal immigrants. As undocumented \naliens take increasingly desperate measures to cross our border with \nMexico, the burden borne by States along the Southwestern border \ncontinues to grow.\n  The Federal Government's attempt to stem illegal immigration in Texas \nand California has made it increasingly difficult to cross the border \nin these States. Unfortunately, these actions have created a funnel \neffect, giving Arizona the dubious distinction of being the location of \nchoice for illegal border crossers. Reports suggest that at least one \nin three of the illegal border crossers arrest traversing the U.S.-\nMexico border are stopped in Arizona. Last year approximately 320 \npeople died in the desert trying to cross the border. Additionally, the \nnumber of attacks on National Park Service Officers has increased in \nrecent years. Property crimes are rampant along the border, leaving \nArizona with the highest per-capita auto theft rate in the nation. \nTimes have gotten so desperate that vigilante groups have begun to form \nwith the goal of doing the job the Federal Government is failing to do.\n  The situation along our Southwestern border has reached a crisis. I \nwill continue to support legislative initiatives aimed at addressing \nthe problems that stem from illegal immigration. However, I strongly \nbelieve that the Federal Government desperately needs innovative \nlegislation to address the source of this problem through a guest \nworker program. In the absence of guest worker legislation, we must \ncontinue supporting important programs, such as SCAAP, that assist the \nborder States where the Federal Government has failed.\n  Covering the cost of incarcerating illegal immigrants is yet another \nunderfunded Federal mandate thrust upon struggling State governments. \nLess than two weeks ago, States were struck an enormous blow when the \nfunding for SCAAP was cut in half by the FY 2003 Omnibus appropriations \nbill signed into law by the President. For my own State of Arizona, \nthis means that rather than the $24 million reimbursement Arizona \nreceived in FY 2002--which barely covered one third of the actual cost \nborne by the State--at best Arizona can hope to receive half that \namount. Even more disconcerting are recent suggestions that this \nprogram should be cut completely, because it does not fit within the \nmission of the Department of Justice.\n  I believe that SCAAP is absolutely necessary for all States, \nparticularly those that line our Nation's Southern border. For that \nreason, Senator Feinstein and I are today introducing the State \nCriminal Alien Assistance Program Reauthorization Act of 2003. I am \ngrateful for the opportunity to work with Senator Feinstein, Senator \nKyl, and Congressman Kolbe, who has introduced the companion to this \nbill in the House of Representatives, to correct this problem. The bill \nwe are introducing today will extend the authorization of SCAAP through \n2010 and to authorize increased funding levels to ensure that States \nare not shortchanged and funding for this important program continues \nto increase.\n  At a time when most states are experiencing the worst budge \nshortfalls since the Great Depression, the Federal Government must stop \nshirking the cost for what is truly a Federal responsibility. It is \ntime for us to step up to the plate and reimburse states and local \ncommunities for the costs of our failure to adequately address illegal \nimmigration.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DORGAN (for himself, Mr. Lieberman, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. \n        Kerry, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Conrad, and Mr. Akaka):\n  S. 461.

A bill to provide grants to ensure full and fair \nparticipation in certain decisionmaking processes of the Bureau of \nIndian Affairs; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise with our colleague Senator Lieberman \ntoday to reintroduce two pieces of legislation intended to improve the \nprocess by which the Federal Government\n\n[[Page S2864]]\n\nacknowledges the sovereign rights of American Indians and their tribal \ngovernments. The first bill is called the Tribal Recognition and Indian \nBureau Enhancement Act, or the TRIBE Act. The second bill I am \nintroducing is a bill to provide assistance grants to financially needy \ntribal groups and municipalities so that those groups and towns can \nmore fully and fairly participate in certain decision-making processes \nat the Bureau of Indian Affairs.\n  I offer these bills with a renewed sense of hope, knowing that they \nwill contribute to the larger national conversation about how the \nFederal Government can best fulfill its obligations to America's native \npeoples. Senator Campbell and Senator Inouye have provided invaluable \nleadership on this issue. The bills I am reintroducing were the subject \nof a hearing before the Indian Affairs Committee last fall. While \nneither bill was reported out of Committee before the end of the last \nCongress, I hope that the Indian Affairs Committee will continue its \nwork on these and related bills--including Senator Campbell's recently \nintroduced tribal recognition bill--and will see fit to address the \nproblems that currently plague the recognition process.\n  Currently, there are some 200 petitions pending at the Bureau of \nIndian Affairs by groups from throughout our Nation seeking Federal \nrecognition as Indian tribes. Nine of these are in the State of \nConnecticut. These are in addition to the two tribes already recognized \nin our State: the Mashantucket Pequot tribe and the Mohegan Tribal \nNation.\n  I want to emphasize that as a State, Connecticut has embraced its two \nestablished and federally recognized tribes--the Mashantucket Pequot \ntribe and the Mohegan Tribe. They have generated thousands of jobs for \nConnecticut residents--primarily in the gaming industry. In fact, \nFoxwoods Casino, owned by the Mashantucket Pequot Tribe, is the largest \ngambling casino in the world. Both tribes have delivered hundreds of \nmillions of dollars into the treasuries of our State and towns dollars \nthat have been used to help meet needs in housing, health care, \neducation, and transportation for people throughout the State.\n  Like any large enterprise, these casinos have placed significant \ndemands on the roadways, water systems, and police and fire \ndepartments. By some estimates, an average of 20,000 to 40,000 people \nvisit these two casinos every day, seven days a week, 365 days a year.\n  Clearly, Federal recognition is an important legal status that can \nprofoundly change both Indian and non-Indian communities. Our \nexperience in Connecticut has taught us that Federal recognition is too \nimportant to be treated lightly.\n  I would not be back before the Senate to address this issue if I did \nnot believe that there are serious defects in the process for tribal \nrecognition. This is a significant issue for Connecticut, but it is \nalso a matter of concern for the entire country. The tribal recognition \nprocess is broken. And the process is harming communities and tribes \nacross the country.\n  The problems with the current recognition process have been well \ndocumented and I do not intend to restate all that has been said and \nwritten about the subject in recent years. Suffice it to say that it is \nwidely recognized that the process is failing both tribal groups and \nother interested parties. The General Accounting Office, in a highly-\ncritical study released in November 2001, summarized the problem when \nit concluded that ``because of weaknesses in the recognition process, \nthe basis for BIA's tribal recognition decisions is not always clear \nand the length of time involved can be substantial.''\n  Senator Campbell, Chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee, has \neloquently pointed out the irony that descendants of native peoples who \nhave lived in North America for thousands of years are the only \nAmericans that must be ``documented'' to prove their status. How much \nmore bitter that irony has become now that a process established to be \nfair and considerate toward native peoples is, in many ways, working \nagainst them. Let me share with our colleagues some compelling facts, \nwhich I have referenced here on the floor of the Senate before.\n  Decisions on tribal petitions do not take months to make. They \ntypically take years--and sometimes decades, thanks to understaffing \nand the demands of complying with FOIA requests and litigation. At its \ncurrent pace, it will take well over 100 years for BIA to clear just \nits existing backlog of tribal recognition petitions. Can you imagine \nany group of Americans having to wait years or decades to have their \nlegal rights vindicated? We would not and do not tolerate those kinds \nof delays in other areas of federal administrative law. Yet they are \ncommonplace with respect to groups seeking Federal tribal status.\n  Tribes, towns, and other interested parties have often had their \nevidentiary submissions ignored. During consideration of two recent \npetitions, the BIA decided it would no longer accept evidence submitted \non the petitions--but the agency failed to tell interested parties for \neleven months. In the meantime, neighboring parties and other \ninterested parties had spent large sums of time and money to submit \nvoluminous additional evidence bearing on whether or not the petitions \nshould have been granted.\n  In some cases, the seven mandatory criteria for recognition have been \nselectively ignored by BIA. In the case of the Eastern Pequot and \nPaucatuck Eastern Pequot petitions, two of the seven criteria for \nrecognition were waived by the then-Assistant Secretary for Indian \nAffairs. According to published reports, he effectively ignored the \nrecommendations of the historians and genealogists on his staff who had \nfound that those criteria had not been met. In another case, there was \na 70-year period during which a petitioner could produce no evidence \nthat it continuously existed as a distinct community exhibiting \npolitical authority. The BIA's technical staff concluded that a 70-year \ngap was too long to support a finding of continuous existence. Despite \nthe lack of evidence, the Assistant Secretary decided that continuous \nexistence could be presumed, and so he went on to deem this criterion \nto be met and to recognize the tribe.\n  Again, the bottom line is that the recognition process is broken. \nLast year, one of our colleagues--a long-time champion for American \nIndian causes--called the current recognition process a ``scandal.'' I \nagree and I think it's bad public policy to allow Federal agencies to \ncontinue to make decisions when their decision-making procedures are so \nflawed.\n  The current process is arcane, burdensome, time consuming, difficult \nto understand, and too easily manipulated for political purposes. The \nevidence is overwhelming that the rules of recognition are being \napplied strictly for some and bent or ignored altogether for others. \nThat's wrong. That's unfair. The Chairwoman of the Duwamish Tribe of \nWashington State has said she and her people ``have known and felt the \neffects of 20 years of administrative inaccuracies, delays and the \nblase approach in . . . handling and . . . processing the Duwamish \npetitions.'' Because the process is so complicated and so different \nfrom other, more familiar, administrative procedures, it is hard for \npeople to have confidence in the BIA's decisions--especially when the \nBIA appears to be applying the rules differently in different cases.\n  The reforms proposed by the TRIBE Act are modest. The TRIBE Act will \npermit any Indian group in the continental United States that desires \nto be acknowledged as an Indian Tribe to file a petition with the BIA. \nIf the group can satisfy the mandatory criteria for federal \nacknowledgment, then the group would be recognized.\n  The legislation simply requires better notice to Indians and non-\nIndian groups. It provides for better fact-finding and it requires the \nSecretary to publish a complete explanation of final decisions \nregarding documented petitions. The bill improves the recognition \nprocess in the following specific ways: first, it would authorize $10 \nmillion per year to better enable the Bureau of Indian Affairs to \nconsider petitions in a thorough, fair, and timely manner. Second, it \nwould provide for improved notice of a petition to key persons who may \nhave an interest in a petition, including: the governor and attorney \ngeneral of the state where a tribe seeks recognition; other tribes; and \nelected leaders of towns in the vicinity of a tribe seeking \nrecognition, third, it would require that a petitioner meets each of \nthe seven mandatory criteria for federal recognition\n\n[[Page S2865]]\n\nspelled out in the current Code of Federal Regulations, and fourth, it \nwould require that a decision on a petition be published in the Federal \nRegister, which would include a detailed explanation of the findings of \nfact and of law with respect to each of the seven mandatory criteria \nfor recognition.\n  I want to emphasize what this legislation would not do. It would not \nrevoke or in any way alter the status of tribes whose petitions for \nfederal recognition have already been granted. It would not restrict in \nany way the existing prerogatives and privileges of such tribes. Tribes \nwill retain their right to self-determination consistent with their \nsovereign status. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the TRIBE Act \nwill not dictate outcomes or micro-manage the agency.\n  As I have often said, I believe that every tribal Government that is \nentitled to recognition should be recognized and should be recognized \nin an appropriately speedy process. But I also think we have to make \nsure that the BIA's conclusions are accurate so there won't be endless \nquestions and disputes over the Bureau's decisions. Every recognition \ndecision carries with it a legal significance that should endure \nforever. Each recognition decision made by the BIA is a foundation upon \nwhich relationships between tribes and States, tribes and towns, \nIndians and non-Indians will be built for generations to come. We need \nto make sure that the foundation upon which these lasting decisions are \nbuilt is sound and will withstand the test of time. We as a Nation \ncannot afford to build relationships between sovereigns on the shifting \nsands of a broken bureaucratic procedure.\n  Let me close with a word about the second bill I am introducing. This \nbill will provide grants to allow poor tribes and municipalities an \nopportunity to effectively participate in important decision-making \nprocesses. When the Federal Government, through the Bureau of Indian \nAffairs, makes decisions that will change communities, it is only right \nthat the government should provide a meaningful opportunity for those \ncommunities, whether tribal or non-tribal, to be heard.\n  As we consider how best to reform the process for tribal recognition, \nwe ought to be guided by the firm principles embedded in the bills I am \noffering here today: fairness, openness, respect, and a common interest \nin bettering the quality of life for all Americans. I look forward to \ndiscussing these and other ideas with Chairman Campbell, Senator \nInouye, and my colleagues here in the Senate, tribal leaders, and \nothers who believe the time for reform has come.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the \n``Tribal Recognition and Indian Bureau Enhancement Act.'' I am proud to \njoin the senior Senator from Connecticut in reintroducing this \nlegislation.\n  Senator Dodd and I are interested in making the tribal recognition \nprocess a more fair and open process. I am aware of another bill \nintroduced last month by Chairman Campbell that also seeks to reform \nthe Bureau of Indian Affairs' recognition process. While I am concerned \nwith several aspects of the Senator's bill, I am nonetheless gratified \nto see that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle recognize that the \ncurrent BIA process is fraught with problems.\n  I know that both Chairman Campbell and Vice Chairman Inouye want to \nreform the broken tribal recognition process at the BIA. I look forward \nto working together with both Chairman Campbell and Vice Chairman \nInouye to craft and pass legislation to fix a process that Vice \nchairman Inouye last year called a ``scandal.''\n  I would first like to reiterate my support for the recognition of our \nhistoric Indian tribes. Unfortunately, this important recognition \nprocess is not operating as it should--in particular, the decisions are \nmurky on the criteria for recognition when, and how, they may be \nsatisfied--and those shortcomings are undermining the legitimacy of the \nentire process.\n  The lack of public confidence in the tribal recognition process is of \ngrave concern to me. In my home State of Connecticut, public interest \nin the recognition process has increased because of the ability of \nrecognized tribes to open large casinos. Senator Dodd and I introduced \nboth of these bills in the 107th Congress in an effort to reinvigorate \nthe process and redeem the BIA program for future generations. Our bill \nwill codify existing recognition criteria and require the BIA to \nprovide notice of pending petitions to various interested groups--\nsomething that will benefit both the tribes and the communities that \nsurround them. The companion bill Senator Dodd and I have introduced \ntoday will and provide the resources that stakeholders of limited means \nrequire to meaningfully participate in the process. As a whole, our two \npieces of legislation move towards a stronger recognition system in \nwhich all interested persons are able to participate, and participate \nmeaningfully.\n  In particular, the ``Tribal Recognition and Indian Bureau Enhancement \nAct'' is intended to ensure that recognition criteria are satisfied and \nall affected parties, including affected towns, have a change to fairly \nparticipate in the decision process. It ensures that: affected parties \nbe given proper notice; that relevant evidence from petitioners and \ninterested parties, including neighboring town, is properly considered; \nthat a formal hearing may be requested, with an opportunity for \nwitnesses to be called and with other due process procedures in place; \nthat a transcript of the hearing is kept; that the evidence is \nsufficient to show that the petitioner meets the seven mandatory \ncriteria in federal regulations; and that a complete and detailed \nexplanation of the final decision and findings of fact are published in \nthe Federal Register.\n  Having created these new procedures, our second bill is intended to \nensure that all stakeholders are able to participate in them. It would \nprovide grants to local governments and needy tribes to allow them to \nhire genealogists, lawyers, and other professionals necessary to \nparticipate in proceedings. Grants would be available to assist \neligible parties in BIA proceedings regarding the recognition of a \ntribe as well as proceedings regarding whether to place land into trust \nfor a tribe. We view these bills as working in tandem: we can't make \nthe recognition process stronger and more transparent without giving \nparticipants the appropriate professional resources. Together, these \nbills insist on systemic reform while investing in ore legitimate \nresults.\n  I want to stress that these bills do nothing to affect already \nrecognized federal tribes or hinder their economic development plans. \nNor do they change existing Federal tribal recognition laws. It is \nstill my hope that tribes could support these reforms, so as to \nbuttress the legitimacy of their recognition rulings.\n  I again want to express my commitment to working with members from \nboth sides of the aisle to craft a more fair and effective tribal \nrecognition process for the BIA. The tribal recognition process is an \nimportant issue not only for Connecticut, but for many States \nthroughout this great Nation of ours. The process, unfortunately, is \nbroken, and we should come together to fix it for the benefit of all \ninvolved. I look forward to working with Senators Dodd, Chairman \nCampbell, and Vice Chairman Inouye on legislation to create a better \nrecognition process.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/26/senate-section/article/S2865-1", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2865-S2871]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 66--AUTHORIZING EXPENDITURES BY COMMITTEES OF THE \n   SENATE FOR THE PERIODS MARCH 1, 2003, THROUGH SEPTEMBER 30, 2003, \n   OCTOBER 1, 2003, THROUGH SEPTEMBER 30, 2004, AND OCTOBER 1, 2004, \n                       THROUGH FEBRUARY 28, 2005.\n\n  Mr. LOTT (for himself and Mr. Dodd) submitted the following \nresolution; which was submitted and read:\n\n                               S.
