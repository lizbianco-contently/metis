Mr. President, on December 15, 2004, my office \nreleased a white paper entitled ``Data Dearth in Offshore Outsourcing: \nPolicymaking Requires Facts.'' This white paper is closely linked to a \nprevious white paper entitled ``Offshore Outsourcing and America's \nCompetitive Edge: Losing Out in the High Technology R and Services \nSectors.'' The latter was released by my office in May 2004. A summary \nof that report appeared in the Record on May 21, 2004.\n  A key conclusion of the May paper was the absence of reliable data to \nmeasure and assess the offshore outsourcing phenomenon. We do not have \ngood data on the offshoring problem, and the data we have are general \nin nature. Estimates vary widely on the number of jobs moving overseas, \nand the lack of reliable data contributes to incorrect conclusions \nabout the impacts of offshore outsourcing, which can result in flawed \npolicy responses. We need data to understand what we are facing so we \ncan chart a sure and steady course for the future. There is enough \nanecdotal data about job losses to spark debate and, in some cases, \nresult in policies which may provide a short-term fix but which do not \nproduce longer term solutions to preserve U.S. innovation and ensure \nU.S. competitiveness. Comprehensive and balanced data on both job gains \nand job losses resulting from offshore outsourcing are essential. This \ndata must be assembled by U.S. Federal Government agencies, including \nthe Department of Commerce and the Department of Labor, where data-\ngathering capabilities are extensive and research methodologies are \ntransparent.\n  The lack of data is critical because the issues raised in the May \nwhite paper are so important. The white paper was designed to stimulate \na deeper review of the long-term implications for our policy responses \nand to change the terms of the debate on offshore outsourcing. The \npaper looked at rising global competition and the challenges posed to \nAmerica's competitive advantage. Globalization is our current and \nfuture reality; there is no escaping it. The U.S. economy is \ninextricably linked to the rest of the world; our fortunes rise and \nfall depending on our performance with our trading partners and our \ncompetitors. Our strength and success with China, India, and other \nemerging markets is as important to future U.S. economic and national \nsecurity as the competition with Japan and Europe was to U.S. growth \nover the last 50 years. The offshore outsourcing phenomenon is one of \nthe challenging manifestations of globalization.\n  The May white paper found that it was not just manufacturing jobs \nthat are subject to global outsourcing--where 2.7 million jobs have \ndisappeared since 2000--but service sector and high-end R jobs are \nalso being hit by offshore outsourcing. And it is not just call \ncenters, data entry facilities, and other entry-level service jobs that \nare impacted by offshore outsourcing. Higher skill professional jobs--\nfrom engineering, computer chip design to nanotechnology R \nbeginning to go overseas, and with these jobs, we may be losing key \nparts of the talent and technology which fueled the record growth and \nprosperity of the 1990s. Fundamental changes are facing us, as key \ncomponents of our innovation infrastructure--knowledge, capital, labor, \ntechnology and facilities--are increasingly mobile. Offshore \noutsourcing of labor, capital, and technology not only hurts workers \nbut threatens our knowledge-based economy. If engineering, design, R, \nand services follow manufacturing abroad, U.S. competitiveness is \nweakened, and our economic prosperity and national security are \nthreatened.\n  What is at stake is the ability of the United States to remain a \nglobal leader in innovation, to maintain good-paying jobs, and to \nexpand our global market share. We must rethink long-term strategies on \ncompetitiveness, innovation, R, trade policy, and enforcement, as \nwell as education and investments in human capital. However, we cannot \nbegin to develop effective solutions until we have an understanding of \nthe scope of the offshore outsourcing phenomenon. The need for data on \noffshore outsourcing is paramount.\n  Lord Kelvin, the 19th century Belfast-born physicist said:\n\n       When you can measure what you are speaking about and \n     express it in numbers, you know something about it; but when \n     you cannot measure it, when you cannot express it in numbers, \n     your knowledge is of the meager and unsatisfactory kind.\n\n  That was in a May 3, 1883 lecture to the Institute of Civil \nEngineers.\n  By improving U.S. Government data collection, we can ensure that our \nknowledge of offshore outsourcing is neither meager nor unsatisfactory, \nbut informed and balanced. With improved data and analysis, we will \nbuild constructive and lasting solutions to address the challenges \nposed by offshore outsourcing.\n  I would like to thank Sara E. Hagigh of my staff and Mary Jane Bolle \nof the Congressional Research Service for their hard work in \nresearching and preparing this report.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have excerpts from the \nwhite paper printed in the Congressional Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n                   Excerpt 1, Summary of White Paper\n\n       The issue of offshore outsourcing has been at the center of \n     many key political and public debates over the last few \n     years. The term ``outsourcing'' has become part of our \n     everyday lexicon, gracing the covers of news magazines, \n     television broadcasts, and playing a central role in \n     Congressional debates during an election year. Most Americans \n     are aware of the issue of offshore outsourcing, but few of us \n     have an understanding of the full dimensions of the problem.\n       To develop a better understanding of offshore outsourcing, \n     my office released a white paper in May 2004 entitled \n     ``Offshore\n\n[[Page S12090]]\n\n     Outsourcing and America's Competitive Edge: Losing Out in the \n     High Technology R and Services Sectors.'' The white paper \n     found that it is not only manufacturing jobs that are being \n     outsourced overseas, where 2.7 million jobs have disappeared \n     since 2000. Offshore outsourcing has also begun to hit high-\n     end services and R jobs, and there is evidence that it is \n     not just call centers, data entry and other entry-level \n     service jobs that are impacted by offshoring. We are \n     beginning to send higher skill professional jobs overseas--\n     including engineering, computer chip design and \n     nanotechnology R, and with these jobs, we may be losing the \n     talent and technology that created the growth of the 1990s. \n     The white paper concluded that offshore outsourcing of high-\n     end services and R jobs could threaten our innovation \n     infrastructure, and therefore our economic prosperity, and \n     our national security.\n       A key conclusion of the white paper was the absence of \n     reliable data to measure and assess the offshore outsourcing \n     phenomenon. Estimates vary widely on the number of jobs \n     moving overseas, and the lack of reliable data contributes to \n     incorrect conclusions about the impacts of offshore \n     outsourcing. The result is flawed and ineffective policy \n     responses. In order to develop effective policies to address \n     the many facets of the offshore outsourcing challenge--\n     including investments in education and human capital, greater \n     investments in Federal, industrial, and services R, and \n     better enforcement of our trade agreements--we must have \n     better, more reliable data.\n       This paper provides a review and assessment of Federal data \n     on offshore outsourcing:\n       1. It begins by identifying a series of questions that \n     would produce useful data to measure offshore outsourcing. \n     These questions address information about job ``losses'' as \n     well as job ``gains'' from offshore outsourcing so we can \n     arrive at a balanced assessment of the impacts of offshore \n     outsourcing.\n       2. The report then surveys ten existing U.S. government \n     data sets, from the Departments of Labor and Commerce, \n     measuring aspects of offshore outsourcing. The report \n     enumerates strengths and weaknesses of each of the ten data \n     sets in measuring offshore outsourcing and identifies which \n     federal agency data best answer the questions posed in Table \n     1 of the report--Useful Data to Measure Offshore Outsourcing. \n     The report also contains Table 2 (Aspects of Offshore \n     Outsourcing Potentially Measurable with Existing Data), Table \n     3 (Legislative Recommendations for Improving Federal Agency \n     Data on Offshore Outsourcing), Appendix A (Federal Agency \n     Data's Strengths and Weaknesses for Measuring Offshore \n     Outsourcing) and Appendix B (Major U.S. trading partners).\n       3. Finally, the report makes five legislative \n     recommendations for improving Federal agency data to provide \n     a more useful measure of offshore outsourcing. The five \n     recommendations (summarized in Table 3, Legislative \n     Recommendations for Improving Federal Agency Data on Offshore \n     Outsourcing) are:\n       a. Extend the Trade Adjustment Assistance Program;\n       b. Require the Office of Trade Adjustment Assistance to \n     report data;\n       c. Require Bureau of Labor Statistics to make changes to \n     Mass Layoff data program;\n       d. Require the Commerce Department to publish annual \n     multipliers; and\n       e. Link Bureau of Economic Analysis and Bureau of Labor \n     Statistics data sets.\n       This report represents a beginning, not the end. We must \n     develop reliable and comprehensive data-gathering \n     capabilities at U.S. government agencies to measure \n     employment and economic effects of offshore outsourcing. \n     Without a better understanding of the scope of the problem, \n     effective policy solutions to offshore outsourcing cannot be \n     developed.\n       This is the fifth major white paper in a recent series on \n     U.S. economic growth my office has released. The four \n     previous papers are:\n       1. ``Offshore Outsourcing and America's Competitive Edge: \n     Losing Out in the High Technology R and Services Sectors,'' \n     May 11, 2004.\n       2. ``Making America Stronger: A Report with Legislative \n     Recommendations on Restoration of U.S. Manufacturing,'' \n     September 2003.\n       3. ``National Security Aspects of the Global Migration of \n     the U.S. Semiconductor Industry,'' June 2003.\n       4. ``Broadband: A 21st Century Technology and Productivity \n     Strategy,'' May 2002.\n\nExcerpt 2, Data We Would Like To Have: Useful Data To Measure Offshore \n                              Outsourcing\n\n       In a perfect world, data on offshore outsourcing and its \n     impact on the U.S. economy would be available to answer \n     questions about job losses from offshore outsourcing and \n     counterbalancing job gains. An assessment of the impact of \n     offshore outsourcing on U.S. employment levels and the \n     overall economy must balance both job gains and job losses. \n     Table 1 on p. 12 sets out these questions together with \n     short-hand answers on where the data can be found to respond \n     to each question. This report will then analyze and assess \n     all Federal agency data on offshore outsourcing.\n       In prioritizing data needs, it would be most important to \n     have data to answer the questions in Part A and Part B of \n     Table 1--a total of 10 questions. Part A includes 6 questions \n     on job losses from offshore outsourcing and Part B poses 4 \n     questions on counterbalancing job gains. If data were \n     available to answer all of the questions in Parts A and B in \n     Table 1, the result would be a reasonably good picture of the \n     positive and negative effects of offshore outsourcing on the \n     U.S. economy, as well as on industries, States, and \n     localities, and their workers. After data in Parts A and B \n     are gathered, it would be useful to have the data in Part C \n     of Table 1, which address 7 specific questions including the \n     role of visa programs in offshoring operations and the impact \n     of offshore outsourcing on career choices of U.S. students.\n       Table 1 shows that almost no data are being made available \n     at this time to provide answers to any of the questions in \n     Table 1. Much of the data is either unpublished or not being \n     collected. Some data relating to U.S. exports and U.S. \n     foreign direct investment (both foreign and domestic) are \n     gathered by the Department of Commerce, but for the more \n     detailed questions relating to offshore outsourcing (listed \n     in Part C of Table 1), no U.S. government agency collects the \n     data. The unavailability of basic data to answer the \n     questions in Parts A and B (job losses and job gains from \n     offshore outsourcing) is in sharp contrast to the \n     comprehensive data that were available to answer similar \n     questions related to Mexico and Canada under the North \n     American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). These data were \n     available between 1994 and 2003 but are no longer being \n     published.\n\n                       Excerpt 3, Recommendations\n\n       The next section outlines five legislative recommendations \n     that might be taken to produce data that would offer some \n     estimates of the extent and nature of offshore outsourcing. \n     These recommendations range from amending existing \n     legislation to increasing Federal agency reporting \n     requirements.\n\n\n recommendation 1: extend the trade adjustment assistance (taa) program\n\n       One recommendation is to extend the TAA program to cover \n     two groups of workers not presently covered who lose their \n     jobs to offshore outsourcing: a) all service sector workers; \n     and b) workers producing ``articles'' who are currently not \n     covered under Sec. 113 of Title I of the Trade Act of 2002 \n     (P.L. 107-210). Sec. 113 provides TAA benefits to workers if \n     they lose their jobs due to shifts in production to certain \n     countries, primarily countries with which the United States \n     has a trade agreement or a trade preference program (see \n     footnote 29 for a list of these 72 countries).\n       On the first issue of covering all displaced service sector \n     workers, there are a number of benefits in making this change \n     to the legislation authorizing the TAA program. Aside from \n     issues of equality in having the Trade Adjustment Assistance \n     Program cover all workers who lose their jobs to offshore \n     outsourcing, extending the program would result in data \n     covering virtually the complete range of jobs lost to \n     offshore outsourcing. From these data, analysts could \n     estimate the effects of offshore outsourcing on the Nation as \n     a whole, on individual industries, and on States and \n     localities. One drawback of expanding the TAA program to \n     provide benefits to services workers whose jobs are lost to \n     offshore outsourcing is that the program would cost more. No \n     estimate has been made on additional costs to the TAA program \n     resulting from covering services workers who lose their jobs \n     due to offshore outsourcing.\n       Legislation has been introduced in the 108th Congress to \n     extend the TAA program to cover service sector workers. \n     Senator Lieberman co-sponsored ``The Services Workers \n     Fairness Act'' (S. 2143), introduced by Senator Durbin, to \n     ensure that services workers losing their jobs to offshoring \n     are eligible for TAA benefits. Senator Lieberman also \n     supported an amendment to the Senate version of the Foreign \n     Sales Corporation-Extraterritorial Income Act bill (S. 1637) \n     introduced by Senators Wyden, Coleman, and Rockefeller to \n     extend the TAA program to cover services workers. While \n     the amendment failed to pass, Congress must continue \n     efforts to extend TAA benefits to all Americans who lose \n     their jobs due to offshoring, including services workers.\n       The second change to the TAA program would extend the TAA \n     program to cover workers producing articles whose job \n     relocates to any country. This provision was included in the \n     Senate-passed version of the TAA reauthorization, included in \n     the Trade Act of 2002, however it was yielded in the \n     Conference committee [See Trade Act of 2002, Conference \n     Report 107-624, July 26, 2002, p. 122.]. Under existing law, \n     TAA benefits go to workers who lose jobs when their firms \n     have shifted production to a country which: a) has a free \n     trade agreement with the United States; b) is a beneficiary \n     country under the Andean Trade Preference Act, the African \n     Growth and Opportunity Act, or the Caribbean Basin Economic \n     Recovery Act; or c) is likely to be an increase in imports to \n     the United States of articles like or directly competitive \n     with those the job loser produced. (Sec. 113, P.L. 107-210).\n       A review of the Department of Labor-Employment and Training \n     Agency's website on the TAA program shows that there are 72 \n     countries that meet these requirements for shifts in \n     production (see footnote 29 of this report for the list of \n     countries). Yet, there are 148 members of the World Trade \n     Organization, and important trading partners and\n\n[[Page S12091]]\n\n     key outsourcing destinations--like China and India--are not \n     on the list for shifts in production. This is a significant \n     limitation in the TAA program. At a minimum, the list of \n     eligible countries for production shifts should be expanded \n     to include all WTO members--currently 148 countries.\n\n\nrecommendation 2: require the office of trade adjustment assistance to \n                              report data\n\n       A second recommendation is to require the Office of Trade \n     Adjustment Assistance to report data which it is already \n     collecting on applications for TAA certification. A database \n     for such reported data could include the following categories \n     of information for certified workers: Name of company, \n     location of business, products produced and North American \n     Industry Classification System (NAICS) industry code, place \n     to which production has shifted, or from which new imports \n     are being sourced, reason for the offshore outsourcing \n     (imports or production shift) and number of workers affected.\n       Publishing data of this type would not be new for the TAA \n     Office. Under the NAFTA-TAA program the office made available \n     data on certifications: a) By number of workers affected; b) \n     by industry code; c) by State and locality of the job losers; \n     and d) by country source of the job loss (i.e., the country \n     which was the source of imports or the target of the \n     production shift). These data are potentially the best, most \n     complete data available because: a) They are a direct count \n     of the estimated number of workers potentially affected by \n     the various offshore outsourcing events; and b) they are \n     required, not voluntary, on the part of applicants for \n     certification.\n       Despite these benefits, TAA data are an imperfect measure \n     of the total jobs lost to offshore outsourcing. They do not \n     measure service-producing jobs outsourced offshore (with a \n     few minor exceptions), and they do not measure all goods-\n     producing jobs outsourced offshore. Other imperfections are \n     that: a) They measure potential, not actual job loss, some of \n     which may not actually have occurred; and b) they fail to \n     measure tertiary jobs lost (e.g., independent service sector \n     jobs which support goods-production operations outsourced \n     offshore, such as those in stores in areas hit by closures).\n\n\n   recommendation 3: require bls to make changes in mass layoff data \n                                program\n\n       Three requirements could improve data being reported by the \n     Bureau of Labor Statistics on the Extended Mass Layoffs \n     Associated with Domestic and Overseas Relocations Survey: 1) \n     Reduce survey size to businesses with 25 layoffs; 2) \n     disaggregate (separate into component parts) data on movement \n     of work; and 3) report data annually instead of quarterly.\n       (1) Reduce Survey Size to Businesses With 25 Layoffs. The \n     Extended Mass Layoff Survey, which contains a question on \n     movement of work, could be conducted on businesses which lay \n     off 25 or more workers instead of businesses which lay off 50 \n     or more workers as is currently the case. A reduction in the \n     size of the companies surveyed would capture more layoff \n     events and increase the share of offshore outsourcing \n     instances reported.\n       BLS officials estimate that expanding the Mass Layoff \n     Survey to layoffs of 25 workers or more would allow the \n     program to identify more than double the number of potential \n     layoff events requiring a telephone interview. BLS officials \n     estimate that such an expansion in the MLS survey program \n     will require $3.3 million in additional funds, including 3 \n     full time equivalent employees. Of this total, $2.7 million \n     would go to States for the MLS employer interview and related \n     activity. The remaining $600,000 would support BLS data \n     collection, analysis, and publication activities.\n       Reducing the size of the business surveyed in the Extended \n     Mass Layoff Survey does not alter the weaknesses of such data \n     and survey methods, namely that the survey is voluntary and \n     the quality of results depends on who in the organization \n     responds to the survey and their knowledge of the causes of \n     jobs going offshore. BLS officials also raised concerns about \n     extra reporting burdens by reducing the size of business \n     surveyed.\n       (2) Disaggregate Data on Movement of Work. BLS could be \n     required to disaggregate (separate into component parts) and \n     report separately detailed data on the two categories of \n     ``movement of work''--movement of work to another location \n     inside the United States versus movement of work to another \n     location outside the United States. Detailed data to be \n     reported could include distribution of layoffs by industry or \n     region of the country affected by the layoff.\n       Many believe that disaggregating the data is the only way \n     to make the data on movement of work useful. In its current \n     form, data on offshore outsourcing are imbedded in data on \n     movement of work within the United States, thus the data are \n     not useful for measuring offshore outsourcing except for a \n     few summary numbers.\n       Even with greater data disaggregation, the Extended Mass \n     Layoff Survey remains voluntary. It is widely believed that \n     companies are reluctant to reveal data on offshore \n     outsourcing, although BLS reports a better than 90 percent \n     response rate in the Extended Mass Layoff Survey in each of \n     the first three quarters of 2004. As previously noted, the \n     quality of survey responses depends on the company contact \n     person who may not readily have answers about whether the \n     ``movement of work'' is to an offshore location or to another \n     location in the United States. Companies will likely argue \n     that providing this level of detail presents additional \n     burdens, both from a personnel and a financial point of view.\n       (3) Report Data Annually. The Department of Labor-Bureau of \n     Labor Statistics could be required to report the Extended \n     Mass Layoff Survey data annually instead of quarterly. Annual \n     reporting would enable more detail to be published, since \n     privacy rules prohibit the reporting of survey data which \n     represents a sample size of fewer than three businesses.\n       Annual reporting of data would not solve the survey's \n     limitations, namely that reporting is voluntary, results \n     depend on who responds to the survey, and the additional \n     reporting burdens placed on businesses. However, we could \n     gain very helpful data if this recommendation was \n     implemented.\n\n\n      Recommendation 4: Require DOC to Publish Annual Multipliers\n\n       The Department of Commerce should be required to publish \n     annual ``multipliers'' showing for goods and services \n     separately and combined, the number of jobs supporting a \n     billion dollars worth of exports in each category. The \n     product of the multipliers and the value of exports can then \n     yield an estimate of the total number of U.S. jobs producing \n     for export. Comparing the number of workers producing for \n     export across years yields an estimate of job ``gains'' from \n     exports over time. These job gain estimates could provide an \n     important context for estimates of job losses and are \n     necessary to provide a full assessment of the effects of \n     offshore outsourcing.\n       Some updating of the model used to prepare the job gains \n     from trade estimates would likely be required in order to \n     produce these data on an annual basis.\n\n\n              Recommendation 5: Link BEA and BLS Data Sets\n\n       The Department of Commerce-Bureau of Economic Analysis and \n     the Department of Labor-Bureau of Labor Statistics should be \n     required to link their data sets, which could provide \n     synergies. BEA could link its data on multinational \n     corporations with relevant BLS data--including occupational \n     data and movement of work data in the Extended Mass Layoff \n     Survey. Both BEA and BLS would be required to be transparent \n     regarding their data collection methodologies. While there \n     may be some value in sharing data and identifying greater \n     detail on wages, occupation and skill level of jobs going \n     overseas, there is no certainty that providing these data \n     links will improve the quality of data on offshore \n     outsourcing. Such data linkages may be more valuable after \n     BEA and BLS improve their individual agency's data collection \n     on offshore outsourcing, by implementing the recommendations \n     in this report and any other suggestions to be developed. \n     However, data linkages could provide important additional \n     perspectives.\n\n                         Excerpt 4, Conclusion\n\n       If all of these legislative recommendations are followed, \n     Congress would have available more accurate data on the \n     phenomenon of offshore outsourcing. This could include better \n     estimates of how many jobs--both goods-producing jobs and \n     services producing jobs--are being outsourced to other \n     countries. From the Trade Adjustment Assistance database, \n     that would be equivalent to the data available between 1994 \n     and 2002 under NAFTA. Data would be available for the United \n     States as a whole and by State, on how many jobs were being \n     ``lost'' by industry, by city, by cause (imports or \n     production shifts), and by country to which jobs were being \n     transferred. Congress would also have available estimates on \n     U.S. jobs ``created'' to balance jobs lost to offshore \n     outsourcing.

Last week the Senate lost one of its most dedicated \npublic servants. Stan Kimmitt was deeply devoted to this great body and \nto his beloved country. He never forgot his humble beginnings and \nstrong Montana roots. Stan devoted his life to public service, always \ndefending democracy and decency whether it was on the dangerous \nbattlefields of War World II Europe or in the Halls of the U.S. \nCapitol, he always held true to his core values.\n  Born James Stanley Kimmitt on April 5, 1918, to wheat farmers in \nLewistown, MT, the 1920s drought forced the family to move to Great \nFalls where he was raised. After graduating from the University of \nMontana in Missoula in 1940, Stan immediately enlisted to serve his \ncountry in World War II. He fought as a tireless combat commander often \nvolunteering to lead the most dangerous missions. Stan was eventually \npart of the first U.S. division to occupy Berlin and he was honored for \nhis service by receiving the Silver and Bronze Stars. Stan would later \nheroically fight in the Korean war and his accomplishments were \nrecognized when he was inducted into the Field Artillery Officer \nCandidate School Hall of Fame. Stan's exemplary military career served \nas a great building block for what lay ahead for his career.\n  When he returned to the States, Stan sought other ways to serve his \ncountry. One presented itself when Mike Mansfield was elected to the \nU.S. Senate from Montana. As Senator Mansfield's chief of staff, Stan \nwas able to honor his roots and work on the issues important to his \nbeloved home State. When Senator Mansfield became majority leader, his \nright-hand man, Stan Kimmitt, became his secretary of the majority. For \n11 years, Mike and Stan worked quietly behind the scenes reaching \nacross party lines to provide support to move the country forward. \nKimmitt's long tenure represented a deep desire to work behind the \nscenes with both sides to provide support to move the country forward. \nIt is clear that both sides respected this commitment.\n  Stan's leadership and ability to move opposing forces forward made \nhim the perfect choice to become Secretary of the Senate, which he \nserved as from 1977 to 1981. In this role Stan became a very \ninfluential member of the Senate. He was never elected but many \nSenators used to affectionately refer to him as the 101st Senator or \nthe third Senator from Montana.\n  After Stan left the Secretary of the Senate position, he continued to \nbe involved in governmental affairs. He sat on the board for the \nDemocratic Leadership Council in 1985. The DLC was instrumental in \nintroducing then-Governor Bill Clinton in 1985 to a wider public. Stan \nrepresented the same ideals that Bill Clinton ran on in 1992. He wanted \nto find politicians that would represent a new energetic vitality in \nthe Democratic Party as Bill Clinton promised to do.\n  In spite of Stan's own notoriety, he continued to value his Montana \nroots. In 1983, he founded the Maureen and Mike Mansfield Foundation. \nThe Maureen and Mike Mansfield Foundation was a tribute to his former \nboss but to Montana as well. The foundation is part of Mansfield's \nlegacy and the causes he advocated during his time in the Senate. The \nfoundation sponsors exchanges, dialogues, and publications to create \nnetworks or partnerships between U.S. and Asian leaders. The foundation \nprovides excellent educational opportunities through fellowships to \nJapan for government employees.\n  Throughout the early 1990s Stan continued political activism that had \nbeen the trademark of his life. In 1991, Stan founded a political \nconsulting firm now known as Kimmitt, Senter, Coates and Weinfurter.\n  Stan brought to politics and his time in the Senate a strong sense of \ndeep moral principles and convictions. He believed that government \ncould and should be a force for good. Stan was very much the idealist \nand did not see bitter division in the Senate only as ideological \ndisagreements. To Stan, the Senate was one big family with all the \ncharacteristics of a family.\n  Stan lived his political life by three principles: First was to hold \ntrue to your conviction; second, be grateful for what is given to you \nand the opportunities you are given; and third, never give up unless \nyou can make it better. The other value Stan saw as important in his \npolitical life was ``to thine own self be true.''\n  Stan started his professional life as a public servant. It seems only \nfitting that the last day of his life he started the morning in the \nSenate cloakroom on the Democratic side talking with former colleagues \nand friends. That night he attended an event honoring retiring \nLouisiana Democratic Senator John Breaux. Stan died honoring a fellow \ncolleague who shared his beliefs and deeply felt convictions. He died \ndoing what he loved best, which was very appropriate, very fitting.\n  Stan, you will be deeply missed in the Senate, but you will not soon \nbe forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/12/20/senate-section/article/S12092-2", "month": "12", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12092-S12093]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HONORING J. STANLEY KIMMITT\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, as the Senate family knows, one of our \nformer Secretaries of the Senate, J. Stanley Kimmitt, passed away \nsuddenly on December 6, 2004. I recently received a note from William \nF. Hildenbrand, another former Secretary of the Senate, concerning Mr. \nKimmitt, and I would like to have its contents printed in the \nCongressional Record. On a historical note, Mr. Hildenbrand had \nsucceeded Mr. Kimmitt as Secretary. This was occasioned by the \nDemocrats losing the majority of the Senate in the elections of 1980. \nIt is clear that admiration of Mr. Kimmitt extends across the aisle.\n  The material follows:\n\n\n[[Page S12093]]\n\n\n       William F. Hildenbrand: It was with great sadness that I \n     learned of the passing of my predecessor, the Honorable J. \n     Stanley Kimmitt. Stan was one of the shining lights in the \n     Senate's illustrious history. He was the twenty-second \n     Secretary of the Senate in its history. We did not know at \n     the time of our meeting that we both had served in the 78th \n     Infantry Division in World War II, and both had crossed the \n     Rhine at Remagan. On the anniversary of that crossing we were \n     honored by the then-mayor of Remagan and invited to attend \n     the ceremonies. Our Senate duties precluded our attendance \n     but Stan managed to have a flag flown over the Capitol and he \n     had it presented to the mayor on behalf of both of us to be \n     flown on the day of the ceremony.\n       Stan was truly a Senate man and the Senate will not see his \n     like again. Vaya con dios, Mr. Secretary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/12/20/senate-section/article/S12093-1", "month": "12", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12093]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO SENATOR ERNEST ``FRITZ'' HOLLINGS\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, with the retirement of Senator Fritz \nHollings, the Senate is losing its fourth most senior member, an \nextraordinary and important repository of institutional history. The \npeople of South Carolina are losing an outspoken and respected \nspokesperson for their needs and concerns. All of us who have served \nwith him are losing an effective colleague, a wise counselor, and a \ngood friend.\n  Friz Hollings has spent well over half a century in public service, \nbeginning with nearly 3 years of military service during World War II \nin the North African and European theaters. He returned to civilian \nlife, received his law degree at the University of South Carolina, and \nin 1948 was elected to the South Carolina House of Representatives, \nwhere he served three terms, two of them as the House speaker pro \ntempore. In 1954 he was elected lieutenant governor, and 4 years later \nhe was elected Governor. He was then 36 years old--the youngest \ngovernor of South Carolina in the 20th century.\n  Over many years and on many issues, Fritz Hollings has shown himself \nto be a public servant with solid common sense. He is also a visionary. \nVery early he foresaw the need for technical education, and as Governor \nnearly 50 years ago, he established South Carolina's system of \ntechnical colleges. In the late 1950s, when other Governors in the \nSouth were setting out plans to preserve legal segregation \nnotwithstanding the Supreme Court's decision in Brown v. Board of \nEducation, the young Governor of South Carolina rallied the people of \nSouth Carolina to comply with the law. ``He managed the peaceful \nintegration of Clemson University back when other Southern Governors \nwere fighting to keep their universities all-white,'' Mike Wallace has \nobserved.\n  The people of South Carolina, the Members of this body, and people in \nevery corner and region of the United States have seen Fritz Hollings' \nforceful combination of common sense and vision at work on issues like \nhunger, the environment, jobs, and fiscal policy. Soon after coming to \nthe Senate, he helped focus the Nation's attention on hunger; WIC, the \nWomen, Infants and Children's Special Supplemental Food Program, was \nmodeled on a pilot program in South Carolina. For more than three \ndecades he has played a major part in the vital movement first to \nestablish, then to maintain and strengthen the legislative framework \nfor protection of the natural environment. It was Fritz Hollings who \nwrote this Nation's first land-use law to protect coastal wetlands. \nAdmiral James Watkins, USN (Ret.), who chairs the U.S. Commission on \nOcean Policy, recently recognized his efforts saying: ``Senator \nHollings' tireless work on behalf of this Nation's ocean and coasts \nwill help preserve and protect our precious marine and coastal \nresources for generations to come. . . . (including) his work to \nestablish the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) \nover 30 years ago. . . .''\n  It was his concern for jobs in South Carolina that led him to \nestablish the State's technical colleges while Governor, and in recent \nyears has made him a forceful critic of policies that facilitate \noutsourcing. ``In South Carolina,'' according to the Chief Justice of \nthe State Supreme Court, Jean Toal, ``we have heard him talk about the \ndebt and outsourcing jobs for 30 years, and all of that is now what the \nAmerican public is so focused on. He was always ahead of his time.''\n  Fritz Hollings believes in the good that government can accomplish. \nIn a recent interview on ``Sixty Minutes,'' he said: ``We believe in \nfeeding the hungry, and housing the homeless, and educating the \nuninformed and everything else like that . . . in `We the people' in \norder to form a more perfect Union.'' In his many years of service to \nthe people of South Carolina and of this Nation, Fritz Hollings has \nfaithfully honored that principle. His common sense, his vision, and \nhis great humor will be missed, but surely not forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/12/20/senate-section/article/S12093-2", "month": "12", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12093]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO SENATOR JOHN BREAUX\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, with the adjournment of the 108th \nCongress, Senator John Breaux is retiring. With his departure Louisiana \nloses a vigorous and effective advocate, the Nation loses a dedicated \nand skillful legislator, and the Members of this body, on both sides of \nthe aisle, lose a trusted and respected colleague and a dear friend.\n  John Breaux has spent 35 years serving the people of Louisiana in one \ncapacity or another. In 1969, as a recent law school graduate, he came \nto Washington for the first time to become a legislative assistant to \nthe Representative from Louisiana's Seventh Congressional District. \nWhen the seat became open 3 years later, John ran for Congress himself, \nand won. He was then 25 years old. From 1973 until 1977, we served \ntogether in the House of Representatives. John continued serving the \nHouse for another 5 years, before being elected to the first of three \nterms in the Senate, in 1986.\n  The decision to come to Washington was a very major decision for the \nBreaux family, so much so that one child prayed: ``Good-bye God. We are \nmoving to Washington.'' For the people of Louisiana and the Nation, it \nhas proved to be a most fortunate decision.\n  John Breaux's accomplishments over 18 years in the U.S. Senate are \nlegion. He has served on the Finance Committee; the Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation Committee; and the Rules Committee. He has chaired \nthe Special Committee on Aging. For 8 years he served his Senate \nDemocratic colleagues as Chief Deputy Whip. He has left his mark on \nvirtually every piece of legislation that passed through the committees \non which he has served. He has been a tireless advocate for older \nAmericans, and a proponent of universal health care.\n  Above and beyond any specific issue, John Breaux has sought to make \ngovernment work. He has won the respect and affection of his \ncolleagues--and, time and again, their attention--with what Charlie \nCook, in ``The Cook Report,'' described as ``his moderation, \npersonality, manner and legislative style.'' In commenting on John's \ndecision to retire, The Shreveport Times called him ``a Louisiana \nnatural resource'' and ``the bridge-builder in an era of burning \nbridges.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/12/20/senate-section/article/S12093-3", "month": "12", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12093-S12094]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO SENATOR JOHN EDWARDS\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, in 1998, John Edwards was elected to the \nU.S. Senate from his home State of North Carolina to fill the seat once \nheld by Senator Sam Ervin. He had never before run for, or served in, \npublic office. From the time he received his law degree in 1977 until \nhe entered the Senate, he was an attorney in private practice. For two \ndecades John represented in court North Carolinians who had been \ngrievously injured or disabled and had no one to speak up for them. He \nquickly made the transition from the courtroom to the Senate Chamber, \nhowever, because in both he has been guided by the same unwavering \nprinciple: putting to work his formidable talents and energy, along \nwith his training, on behalf of ``the people I grew up with.''\n  John Edwards grew up in Robbins, NC. Robbins was a mill town. John's \nfather spent nearly four decades working in textile mills; his mother \nworked in a number of jobs as well. As David Broder once put it, his \nparents and their friends and coworkers were people who ``earn their \nbread by the sweat of their brow.''\n  John was the first person in his family to go to college. For the \nmillions of Americans who were the first in the\n\n[[Page S12094]]\n\nfamily to receive a college education--and I count myself among them--\nthis has very special meaning. He worked his way through school in 3 \nyears, finding summer jobs in the mills. He went on to study law at the \nUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, one of the Nation's \nranking law schools, and there he met, and soon married, a fellow \nstudent, Elizabeth Anania. In his book, ``Four Trials,'' which was \npublished just this year, John pays tribute to the men and women who \nhave played some part in his life, but none is more moving than his \nrichly deserved tribute to Elizabeth: ``I have spent many years trying \nto live up to what she believed I could be, and I am the better for \nit.''\n  In the 108th Congress, John served on the Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions Committee; the Judiciary Committee; the Small Business \nCommittee; and the Intelligence Committee--and also for a while on the \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, where we first had an \nopportunity to work together. These are formidable, wide-ranging \njurisdictions. In every assignment he undertook, John fought for \npolicies, as he has put it, that ``reward work--not just wealth, work--\nand (to) ensure that the American dream stays alive and available to \nevery single American, no matter where they live or who their family is \nor what the color of their skin.''\n  Together with the senior Senator from Massachusetts and the senior \nSenator from Arizona, John Edwards led the successful effort in the \nSenate to pass landmark patients' rights legislation, only to see the \nbill falter in the face of implacable opposition from the White House. \nJohn has been a forceful advocate for the thousands of North \nCarolinians, and indeed Americans, who ``did everything right,'' but \nwere still powerless to prevent their jobs from being swept overseas.\n  When the 109th Congress convenes in January, John Edwards will no \nlonger represent his beloved State of North Carolina in the U.S. \nSenate. He will be home in the State he loves--``the place that made me \nlove America to begin with''--with the family he loves so dearly. \nWhether in the Nation's Capital or in North Carolina, however, we know \nthat John will continue to do what he has always done so well, fighting \n``for those who do not have a voice, to make sure that ``no one--no \none--is lost in America, that that dream is everlasting.'' He will be \nsorely missed in this Chamber.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/12/20/senate-section/article/S12094-1", "month": "12", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12094]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO SENATOR BOB GRAHAM\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, with the adjournment of the 108th \nCongress, Bob Graham completes about 40 uninterrupted years of \ndedicated service to the people of Florida as an elected public \nofficial. Floridian's first elected him to their State house of \nrepresentatives in 1966, where he served two 2-year terms. In 1970 they \nelected him to the State senate, where he served two 4-year terms. In \n1978 Floridians across the State chose him for their Governor; no one \nfrom south Florida had ever before been elected. He served in that \noffice with great distinction for two terms, until in 1986 Floridians \nsent Bob Graham to the first of three terms in the U.S. Senate.\n  Bob Graham has not only worked for the people of Florida; he has \nworked with them. While a State senator, he established a workday \nprogram for himself that regularly took him out of the halls of \ngovernment and into literally dozens of different jobs. Since coming to \nthe Senate, Bob has made time for 214 workdays, which means that \nroughly once a month, for 18 years, he has worked alongside his \nconstituents, all the time learning from them.\n  Bob began his workdays while a State senator, teaching a semester of \ncivics at a Miami high school. Over the years, though, he has not \nlimited himself to a single form of employment: on the contrary, he has \nbeen an agricultural worker, a factory worker, a construction worker; \nhe has worked in the public sector as a policeman and as a trash \ncollector. Writing in the Washington Post on May 4, 2003, Michael \nGrunwald observed that the regular, wide-ranging workdays became ``a \nremarkable window'' for Bob Graham's political education. Working as an \nauto mechanic, Bob Graham learned first-hand that ``Florida auto \ninspections were a joke. He learned at a nursing home that orderlies \nearned only $17 a day. He learned as a parking attendant that tiny curb \ncuts changed the lives of disabled workers.'' Bob used the workday \nprogram to learn directly from his own observation and experience, and \nnot simply from the reports of others.\n  Florida is an extraordinarily diverse State in its demography, its \nenvironment, and its economy. In many ways it encapsulates the broad \nrange of challenges that we confront not just in our States, but in the \nNation at large. Senator Bob Graham brought to the great debates in the \nCongress over education, health care, the economy, environmental \nstandards, and many other issues, domestic and foreign, his substantial \nexperience as a State legislator and Governor. The legislation enacted \nin 2000 to restore the Florida Everglades was built around a program \nthat Governor Bob Graham had established in 1983. It was not only his \nState that benefited, it was our Nation; for the Everglades are a \nprecious national resource. As chairman of the Intelligence Committee \nin the 107th Congress, Bob Graham provided vigorous and clear-headed \nleadership in the aftermath of the attacks of September 11.\n  Broadly experienced in public governance as Bob is, he has had the \nwisdom to remain a student of government. The U.S. Senate is both a \nplace to protect and advance the needs and concerns of constituents, \nand also a place to learn; as he put it in his remarks in this Chamber \non December 7: ``The Senate is our country's best graduate school.'' He \nleaves the Senate with an abiding and profound concern for programs to \nkeep our country safe, improve our children's schools, improve our \nhealth care, and strengthen employment opportunities, among many \nothers. Above and beyond these programs, however, as he observed on \nDecember 7, is the very institution of the Senate itself, with a \n``unique role'' to play ``in balancing our Government in order to avoid \nexcessive power falling into the hands of any one person or \ngovernmental institution.''\n  For over 18 years Bob has worked to ensure that this body does indeed \nhonor its unique role among our institutions of government. The Senate \nis stronger for having Bob Graham as a Member.
