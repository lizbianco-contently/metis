That cloture vote will occur tomorrow \nmorning. We expect cloture to be invoked; therefore, we hope to finish \nthat conference report at an early time on Friday.\n  In addition, as everyone is aware, we continue to await completion of \nthe Omnibus appropriations bill. It is still our hope and desire to \nfinish our work on Friday, if at all possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/18/senate-section/article/S11442-3", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11442]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             BIPARTISANSHIP\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, after this month's historic election, \na lot of political pundits are ardently trying to figure out what the \nresults may have meant. I have been in politics for a period of time, \nso I would like to share my point of view on the matter.\n  Obviously, people on our side of the aisle are pleased that the \nelectorate has returned President Bush for a second term, and obviously \nwe are equally pleased that the larger Republican majority in both \nHouses of Congress will be available to work with the President next \nyear. The last time a reelected President returned to office with \nlarger majorities of his party in both the House and the Senate was \nback in 1936 when President Roosevelt was running for reelection the \nfirst time. If the American people suddenly speak louder than they have \nin 70 years, I think it is clear that they would like to see some \naction.\n  The voters didn't send any of us Republicans or Democrats up here \njust to sit in these chairs. They sent us here to get things \naccomplished. Republicans can't and shouldn't do that alone. We will \nneed to cooperate with our colleagues across the aisle to produce \nresults, which is what we were sent here, of course, to do.\n  Soon Republicans will fill 55 seats in this Chamber. That is a nice \nnumber but it is not 60. And it often takes 60, as we all know. \nFrequently--actually most of the time--it takes 60 to get results in \nthe Senate.\n  So to our Democratic friends on the other side, let me say we want to \nwork with you. The voters expect us to work in a bipartisan manner to \nmake our country more secure, our economic opportunities more \nplentiful, and our common values more respected. To do that, we need \nyour support, and we will work to earn it.\n  Last week, Senator Lieberman, a good friend of mine and a good friend \nof many of us in the Senate, came to my hometown of Louisville, KY, \nwhere he spoke at the University of Louisville, my alma mater, where he \ngave an outstanding speech. In it he said:\n\n       It is critically important that we put first things first, \n     and national interests ahead of our party interests.\n\n  I commend the Senator from Connecticut for his exemplary spirit of \ngoodwill. I think that is a good guidepost for all of us as we begin \nthe 109th Congress in January.\n  I say to my Democratic friends that we are all willing to work with \nthem in that same spirit which Joe Lieberman outlined. Together, we are \ngoing to accomplish great things of which this body can truly be proud.\n  We will have hard tasks ahead of us. The Social Security system is a \nspeeding train heading for a brick wall and really must be set right \nfor future generations. The tax system is burdensome and unfair and \nmust be reinvented to fit our 21st century economy. We have to finish \nthe job in Iraq so we can bring our troops home safely and with honor.\n  We have tackled tough challenges before. Working together--\nRepublicans and Democrats--successfully reformed the welfare system and \nput millions of Americans on the path to self-reliance and financial \nstability. Working together--Republicans and Democrats--projected \nAmerican power into the former Yugoslavia to halt the killing of \ninnocents and provide humanitarian aid. Working together--Republicans \nand Democrats--we moved the brutal Taliban regime from Afghanistan and \nstruck a fatal blow against al-Qaida.\n  Now we have a chance to make history again. Republicans are not \nlikely to accomplish much alone. The same is true for our Democrat \ncolleagues. This Senate should heed America's call for action. The \nvoters of our States didn't send us here to simply mark time. They sent \nus here to build a better America for our sons and daughters, and \nfuture generations yet to come.\n  As we move forward, this new Congress must be prepared to get to \nwork, and to get to work on a bipartisan basis.\n  I yield the floor. what\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/18/senate-section/article/S11442-4", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11442]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, first, let me say that it is this \nSenator's personal desire, following the comments the Senator from \nKentucky has so ably given, that we came here to try to make things \nbetter for the world in the years beyond and for our children. So much \nof what he talk about--whether it is Social Security or the Tax Code or \nour needs and in foreign policy--does require that we work together.\n  I commend the Senator for his comments. We do have to work together \nas we go forward.\n  In fact, one of the things I want to talk about, and why I came to \nthe Senate, one of the areas is where bipartisanship and joint effort \nhas been fundamental to raising an issue, framing it, and getting it in \nfront of the American people. I come to the Senate today to talk about \nthe genocide in Darfur, Sudan, and what we, the United States of \nAmerica, are going to be doing about it.\n  Today, the U.N. Security Council is meeting in Nairobi, Kenya, to \ndiscuss Sudan and to seek the end of the civil war between the north \nand the south. This is a good thing and I congratulate Ambassador \nDanforth, in particular, for his personal efforts in making this \npossibility real and tangible.\n  Multilateral diplomacy is critical. Peace between north and south is \nan important component of an overall political solution for the Sudan. \nAt the end of the day, if we do not stop the killing in Darfur--which \nis independent in many ways from the north-south issue--if we do not \nstop the genocide, then we fail.\n  Members will hear me say repeatedly words are important; deeds are a \nreality. Lives are at stake. What greater moral imperative can we have \nthan to stop genocide? What greater moral failure can there be than \nallowing genocide to occur? The death toll is mounting in Darfur with \nall kinds of estimates--70,000, over 100,000, 125,000.\n  The issue is stark: life or death. Deeds, not words, are what \nmatters. History will judge us based on whether we actually stop this \ngenocide--not whether we gave great speeches or\n\n[[Page S11443]]\n\npassed great resolutions or made statements, but what have we done to \nstop it.\n  The words have all been said. In July, this body unanimously passed a \nbipartisan resolution introduced by Senator Brownback and myself, \ndeclaring that the atrocities in Darfur were genocide. On the same day, \nthe House passed a similar resolution. In September, Secretary Powell \nmade the same declaration for the administration. We all welcomed the \nannouncement.\n  Since then, the situation has only deteriorated. The death toll may \nhave already gone over, as I suggested, 100,000 human beings. Armed \nmilitias continue to rape women and girls with impunity. Civilians are \nbeing driven from their homes by the hundreds of thousands. Now the \nrefugees are being driven from one camp to another camp, or even out of \nthe camps altogether. The displaced population in Darfur is over 1.5 \nmillion. That is what is confirmed.\n  In the last few weeks, Janjaweeds have attacked these IDP camps, the \nrefugee camps, destroying shelters, beating civilians, and forcibly \nmoving people from one location to another.\n  The escalating violence preventing humanitarian organizations from \nreaching needy people is also occurring. Already, nearly one-quarter of \nthe children under the age of five in Darfur are certifiably \nmalnourished and close to half of the families do not have enough food.\n  Recently, food convoys have been attacked and large areas of Darfur \nare now effectively closed to the humanitarian organizations that are \ndistributing food, medicine, and other elements. Hundreds of thousands \nof needy refugees cannot be reached.\n  Before this wave of violence--even before it--World Food Program \nreported that it served 175,000 fewer people in October than September. \nGet that: Statistics for our program serving the needy are going down, \n175,000 fewer people in October than in September.\n\n  When I visited Darfur in August, the conditions were grim. The one \nray of hope was the pressure from the international community, \nincluding a threat of sanctions that forced the Government in Khartoum \nto allow access by humanitarian organizations. Humanitarian workers \nwere overwhelmed by the number of refugees, but they were working hard \nand saving lives. As a result, estimates of the death toll, which could \nhave gone as high as a million, were scaled back after that. With the \nviolence intensifying and humanitarian organizations again restricted \nin their movements, we sadly revisit our gravest fears.\n  The other recent development is the disintegration of order in the \nregion. Anger and resentment are on the rise among the displaced, and \ncivil war between Khartoum and the rebels is escalating. All the \nconditions are in place for a complete collapse, for long-term \ninstability and an indefinite humanitarian crisis.\n  As Jan Pronk, the U.N. Special Representative for Sudan, warned on \nNovember 4:\n\n       Darfur may easily enter a state of anarchy; a total \n     collapse of law and order.\n\n  Permitting such a thing to happen is not only immoral, it is \nantithetical to our national security interests. Remember, Sudan is the \ncountry that once harbored Osama bin Laden. The prospects of becoming a \nterrorist breeding ground are real. This is something that needs to be \naddressed now.\n  This has not happened since the administration declared genocide was \ntaking place. Whatever the message that declaration sent, it was \nclearly not enough and may even have sent the wrong message that the \nUnited States may declare that genocide is existing and then not act to \nstop it.\n  Words without deeds violates the moral and legal obligation we have \nunder the genocide convention but, more importantly, violates our sense \nof right and wrong and the standards we have as human beings about \nlooking to care for one another. Words without deeds is an affront to \nthe principle that guides our Nation and makes a mockery of the values \nwe as public servants claim to love. The American people know this, \nwhich is why people of faith, of all religions and denominations and \ncivic groups throughout the country, call for concerted, resolute, \neffective action.\n  Details matter. What will it actually take to stop this genocide? In \nSeptember, this body passed by voice vote an amendment offered by \nmyself and Senator DeWine to provide $75 million for an expanded \nAfrican Union force in Darfur. The funding is now being negotiated with \nthe House of Representatives in the so-called Omnibus bill but has had \nlittle if any support from the administration and some in the Senate.\n  Senator DeWine and myself offered the amendment after the U.N. \nSecurity Council passed a resolution calling for assistance to the AU \nand after Secretary Powell testified the current United States \ncontribution of $20 million would not be enough. Get that, $20 \nmillion--not billions, trillions, which we normally are talking about.\n  An expanded African Union force of 3,000 will cost roughly $220 \nmillion. The European Union recently pledged half that amount would be \nforthcoming. We can afford to pay for the rest. We cannot afford to \nwalk away from our moral obligation. Madam President, $75 million is \nless than half of what the administration sought for waste disposal in \nIraq. It is insignificant compared to the costs of the wars that are \nwaging around the globe. What we cannot afford is to provide anything \nless. Shortchanging AU troops or delivering only incremental assistance \nmay be worse than doing nothing. They do need helicopters, vehicles, \ncommunication equipment, and housing to patrol Darfur. We are moving \nforces into Darfur, but we do not give them the tools they need to be \nable to do what they are there for and we are setting them up for \nfailure. We risk undermining the very credibility of a burgeoning \nability to deal with some of these crises that happen all across \nAfrica, and not just in Darfur. It is precisely now when we need to \ngive them the resources to be able to succeed.\n\n  We should not kid ourselves about the effectiveness of the AU force. \nThey are responsible for monitoring the April cease-fire. There was an \nagreement reached November 9 that includes a no-fly zone that the AU \nforce must enforce. To quote the current AU chair, Nigerian President \nObsanjo, these agreements ``won't be worth the paper they're written on \nif they are not scrupulously implemented on the ground.'' His words are \nright. Words without deeds, without resources, is meaningless.\n  The potential for the situation to overwhelm the AU force is real. \nThe region is enormous and every day as the violence gets worse, the \nchallenge grows. The answer is not to dismiss the AU force but to do \nwhatever it takes to make it effective. If 3,000 troops is not enough, \nwe should consider others and more. If $220 million is not enough, we \nshould, along with our allies, push to have additional resources. \nHundreds of thousands of lives are at stake. If the AU cannot set up \ncommand-and-control communications or intelligence right away, we \nshould help them do it.\n  In the end, the only test is whether we stop the killing. The same \ntest applies to sanctions. This week's efforts to reach a north-south \nagreement are important, but we must not weaken in any way the pressure \non Khartoum with regard to Darfur. Only consistent, strong, credible \ninternational pressure has ever changed Khartoum's behavior. I heard \none senior administration official say that when their lips are moving, \nthey are lying. This means we need to apply pressure. This means an \nembargo, seizing assets, restricting travel of government officials \nand, yes, going after Sudanese oil and gas companies that deal in the \nfinances that allow this tragedy to continue to unfold. We should be \nworking with our allies to put in place effective sanctions. If members \nof the U.N. Security Council are not amenable, we should work with the \nEU. We also have leverage through our own capital markets. The test is \nwhether we are prepared to stop genocide, something we have all \ndeclared exists, something the administration has declared.\n\n  How can we be discussing these options? We should be acting. There is \nno more critical moment than now. The pieces are in place.\n  Today, the U.N. Security Council is meeting in Nairobi preparing to \nissue another resolution on Sudan, although I hear the discussion is \nvery limited with regard to actions they will take with regard to \nKhartoum. The United States has rightfully called this genocide. The \nU.N. Security Council has\n\n[[Page S11444]]\n\nagreed on paper that sanctions should be imposed if Sudan does not stop \nthe violence. That violence has not stopped.\n  The Security Council has called on member states to support an \nexpanded AU force, and the African Union, 2 years old, has stepped up. \nIts leadership is committed to preventing another genocide if we will \nhelp. We are the world's only superpower. Genocide is happening and we \nmust act. President Bush campaigned on a platform of acting wherever \nnecessary to protect our interests overseas regardless of world \nopinion.\n  With all that has happened in the last few years, how can we claim to \nbe constrained in this situation with this action taking place against \nthe human race? We are the world's superpower. If we do everything that \nwe should do, history will judge that we acted. But they will judge us \nharshly if we do not step up to save these lives that will be lost in \nthe years and the months and the days ahead. If we hesitate now, if we \nmake excuses, most of us think we will have a hard time forgiving \nourselves for what we did not do. Rwanda is burned in our memory. We \nshould not allow hundreds of thousands of people to die. We will have \ndoomed the AU to ineffectual operations on the ground, and we will have \ndamaged its credibility and its underlying ability to respond to crises \nin the future.\n  I hope we will act. I hope we will not turn the pages of this omnibus \nfinancing without giving the resources to act. Words are not good \nenough; deeds are required. I hope we will not have failed our people \nand our values we hold dear.\n  I thank you, Madam President.

Madam President, I rise this morning to pay tribute to \na very special friend of mine and a friend of Georgia's and a friend of \nthe United States of America. We are in what we think are our last \ncouple of days of the 108th session. That being the case, this will be \nthe last few days that Senator Zell Miller will be in Washington in his \ncapacity as the senior Senator from our great State of Georgia. I want \nto take a minute just to talk about this man who has been such an \ninspiration to any number of politicians and others in my State \nrelative to his public service to our State and to our country.\n  Zell Miller was born in a little town called Young Harris, GA, which \nis in the mountains of north Georgia, one of the most beautiful parts \nof our State. His father, unfortunately, died when he was 17 days old, \nso he was raised by his mother, whom he has repeatedly talked about in \nthe books he has written as well as in his speeches. His mother Birdie \nwas the most influential person in his life. She did a heck of a job \nwith Zell Miller as a young man and remained an inspiration to him \nthroughout his adult life, and particularly in his life as a public \nservant to our State.\n  Zell did one of the best things any man can do; and that is, he \nmarried way over his head early in his life. He married his sweetheart, \nShirley. Before he went into the Marine Corps, he tells the story about \nleaving for boot camp and he was afraid when he got back she might not \nmarry him, so while they were in the mood they ran over to South \nCarolina, which is not far away from his hometown of Young Harris, and \ngot married; and they have had decades of glorious years together. They \nhave two wonderful sons and four grandchildren and now four great-\ngrandchildren whom the two of them have enjoyed. Now he will have even \nmore of an opportunity to spend time with them and enjoy them even \nmore.\n  Zell entered the Marine Corps at an early age. Again, as he has \nrepeatedly said in his books, as well as in his speeches, it is the \nbest thing he ever did in his life from the standpoint of straightening \nhim out. All of us go through difficult times in our early years, and \nthere are specific instances that make us what we are and sort of chart \nthe course for where we are going to be in future years. Zell has been \nvery open about the fact that the Marine Corps is the institution that \nreally put his mind in the right frame that it needed to be for his \nadult years.\n  Zell began his educational career at Young Harris College following \nhis tenure in the Marine Corps, and then ultimately graduated from the \nUniversity of Georgia, which happens to be the same institution of \nwhich I graduated. Again, having a colleague such as Zell to look to as \na fellow alumnus is a great privilege.\n  Zell then began a teaching career, and also very shortly entered a \npublic service career. He served two terms as a State senator from his \nhome county area of Young Harris. I think that was the foundation for \nwhat was going to ultimately become an outstanding career for him in \npublic service. Like all of us, he suffered defeat as well as victory. \nHe ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. House of Representatives twice. \nHaving run for Congress myself, and lost the first time, I know it is \nnot much fun, but you also find out it is the greatest experience of \nyour life. You meet the nicest people in the world, and you get a real \nsense of the fact that there are just literally thousands and thousands \nof people in that congressional district who have the same beliefs and \nphilosophy that you do, so you want to continue to make a difference.\n  Even though Zell lost those races when he ran twice, that did not \ndeter him from continuing in public service. He served as our \nLieutenant Governor for four terms, 16 years. He just did a masterful \njob. The Lieutenant Governor in Georgia has a little more power than \nsome of the Lieutenant Governors in other States around the country. He \npresided over the State senate, and in that capacity had the obligation \nand the power to appoint committee chairmen and to be involved in \nlegislation from a direct standpoint. He did an outstanding job as \nLieutenant Governor.\n  Following those four terms, he ran for Governor and, in 1990, was \nelected Governor of our State for the first of his two terms. In 1990, \nhe campaigned on the fact that if we were going to have a State \nlottery--that was one of the hot issues on the ballot that year--that \nif we were going to have a State lottery, he wanted to make sure the \nfunds that were generated by that lottery were used for one purpose, \nand one purpose only, and that was to improve the quality of education \nin our State.\n  I have to say if there is any one man who is responsible for the \nimprovement of the quality of education in my State of Georgia, it is \nZell Miller because he not only campaigned on doing that, he made \nabsolutely certain all the funds generated from that State lottery went \nto improve the quality of education.\n  He is the father of the HOPE Scholarship. It is kind of interesting, \nin every campaign now, every statehouse campaign and gubernatorial and \nlieutenant gubernatorial race now, those folks who have been involved \nin State politics for a while who are running for those races all claim \nresponsibility for the HOPE Scholarship. But everybody knows that the \nfather of the HOPE Scholarship, the person who was responsible for its \npassage and implementation, is Zell Miller.\n  The HOPE Scholarship is a provision in our law which says, if you \ngraduate from a high school in Georgia and you have a B average, you \ncan go to any State institution that you are successful in applying to \nand getting into, and your tuition will be paid for. As long as you \nmaintain a B average, that tuition will be paid for throughout your \ncollege career. It has been one of the best things we have ever had \nhappen in our State.\n\n[[Page S11445]]\n\n  We have been successful keeping our top students at home and \nattending our State universities. One of the main reasons is the HOPE \nScholarship. We have kids who might otherwise go to a school in the \nNortheast or the West Coast that has a much greater national \nreputation, but they do not give the scholarships like the HOPE \nScholarship to all their students who maintain those averages.\n  So Zell Miller has been primarily responsible for keeping an awful \nlot of the top kids graduating from our public institutions as well as \nour private institutions in Georgia at our State institutions. As a \nresult of that, we have seen the average SAT scores at the University \nof Georgia, for example, rise every single year since the HOPE \nScholarship went into effect. I do not know what the exact number is \nfor the entering class this year, but I have confidence in saying the \naverage SAT score for the entering freshmen class at the University of \nGeorgia this year is well in excess of 1250, probably closer to \nsomething in excess of 1300. At Georgia Tech it is higher than that. \nAnd in other institutions we have seen the same impact. We are simply \ngetting the brightest and the best because of Zell Miller and his \ncommitment to the people of Georgia and his commitment to increasing \nthe quality of education in our State.\n  As Governor, he put into effect a voluntary pre-K program for 4-year-\nold kids. All of us know that the earlier we involve our children in \nthe education process, the more likely they are to come out, at the end \nof the day, with a better education. It is one of the best things we \never did from the standpoint of putting our kids in touch with the \nschool system at an early age. And it has worked.\n  I could go on and on talking about the things that Senator Miller did \nas Governor, but I want to sum it up with two anecdotes.\n  First, again, education-wise, he was committed to ensuring that the \neducation of the children of our State improved every year he was in \npublic service. I will never forget his last 4 years--and I know this; \nI remember specifically because my wife was a teacher in the public \nschool system at that point in time. We were ranked 49th out of 50 with \nrespect to the average teacher salaries. Zell Miller put into place--\nand he made a commitment to the teaching community and made a \ncommitment to the legislature that they were going to have to abide by \nthis. He was going to provide a 6-percent increase in teacher salaries \nevery year for his last 4 years, about a 25-percent increase for \nteacher salaries across the board. He not only made the commitment, but \nhe did it. We went from 49th in average teacher salaries to somewhere \nin the high twenties over the 4 years of Zell Miller's last tenure as \nGovernor of our State.\n  He also made a commitment to the people of Georgia that if you elect \nme for 4 more years, then I am not going to be just your average \nGovernor and put it on cruise control and go out as a popular guy--and \nhe had every opportunity to do that.\n  I will never forget riding back up here on an airplane after one \nweekend, and I happened to sit beside Zell. This was several years \nafter he had left the Governor's office, but I was a Member of the \nHouse. I said: Zell, I guess if there is anything about you, and I were \nto remember one thing over everything else, it is the fact that in your \nlast 4 years you did what you thought was right, irrespective of the \nfact that you could allow the legislature to pass whatever they wanted \nto and you could sign it into law. A lot of the legislation were very \npopular bills with the people back home, but they simply were not the \nright thing to do. He would veto them. He would veto them, not because \nhe had anything against the issue or the people promoting the bill, but \nit was the right thing to do. It was not in the best interest of all \nGeorgians.\n  A lot of people ask me today, Why has Zell Miller changed? Zell \nMiller has never changed. In his heart, he believes we live in the \ngreatest country in the world. He believes in his heart that he and I \nlive in the greatest State in this great country. He is totally \ncommitted to doing what he thinks is right. He did it then when he \nvetoed a lot of popular bills, and he didn't have to do that; it would \nhave been easy not to do that. That is why today when he speaks it is \nfrom his heart because he is doing what he thinks is right.\n  As he closes out his career, he and I are both mindful every day of \nthe fact that Zell Miller didn't want to be here. It was not his wish \nthat he serve in the Senate when he was asked to serve. He ran for the \nSenate in 1980 and was not successful. But he had no intention of \ncoming back to the Senate. Unfortunately, Paul Coverdell, who was his \nvery close friend and one of my political mentors, passed away in 2000, \nand our Democratic Governor, Roy Barnes, went to Zell Miller and said: \nYour State needs you, your country needs you, and I need you to fill \nthe unexpired term of Paul Coverdell. So Zell, after much thought about \nit, decided to leave the mountains of north Georgia and his hometown of \nYoung Harris and go back into public service, to come to Washington. He \nand Shirley have been here since July of 2000, when he was appointed to \nfill that unexpired term. He ran in 2000 and was elected to the \nremainder of the unexpired term. So it wasn't his desire to come back, \nbut, as always, when he has been called upon to fill a void and to be a \npublic servant for his State and his country, he has answered that \ncall--not unlike when he joined the Marine Corps.\n  As he leaves this great institution at the end of this term in \nanother 6 or 8 weeks, this man is going to be missed by those who have \nlooked up to him from a political perspective. He has been a person \nthat all of us in politics admire because he has always operated in a \nbipartisan way and made sure he reached across the aisle and brought \nRepublicans into his Democratic administration when he served as \ngovernor. Probably one of the highlights of that is the man who is \nreplacing him in the Senate, my good friend Johnny Isakson, who has \nbeen a longtime Republican in our State.\n\n  In Zell's second term as governor, he knew that with education being \na priority he needed a top-flight person to head up our State board of \neducation. He reached out to Johnny Isakson, who was then out of \npolitics, and brought him into his administration to chair the State \nboard of education. Johnny did a terrific job. As a result of that, he \ncame on to the House to replace Newt Gingrich, and now he will be \nreplacing Zell Miller in the Senate. That is simply the kind of guy \nZell Miller is.\n  So it wasn't politics; it was what was in the best interest of our \nState, what could he do to continue to improve the quality of the \neducation of our kids. He just did the right thing. It is the same as \nhe did in supporting our Republican President. He knew it was the right \nthing to do. That is why he was so vocal about it. Irrespective of the \nconsequences politically, he did what in his heart he thought was the \nright thing to do.\n  So now as Zell goes back to Young Harris, I fully expect him to stay \nengaged in the process. He is not the kind of guy who is going to wilt \naway, but he will not be as active as he has been for the last three \ndecades. He will be sitting on his front porch with his two dogs, Gus \nand Woodrow, playing with his grandchildren, and enjoying his family. I \nam sure his mind will, at times, wander back to his times in Atlanta at \nthe State capital, and to the days he spent in this institution, and he \nwill have some great memories. But those of us who have had the \nprivilege and the opportunity to serve with him are going to have even \nbetter memories.\n  Zell Miller is a great American, a great Georgian, and he is somebody \nall of us are going to miss in the day-to-day world of politics. But he \nis somebody who, when we look back and say, you know, if I charted my \ncourse the way he did, I can leave this institution with a great \nfeeling knowing that I have done what was in the best interest of my \nState and in the best interest of my country. So to Zell Miller and to \nShirley, I say thank you. Julianne and I have a great appreciation for \nyou and a great friendship with you. We look forward to continuing that \nfriendship. We will miss you here in the U.S. Senate. God bless you.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, it seems that several things \nhave happened with regard to questions of matters of faith and what \nsome would call cultural issues that seem to be upside down in America.\n  Just in the last few days, we have seen several ABC stations across \nthe country that have had a fear of being fined by the Federal \nCommunications Commission for showing the award-winning movie, ``Saving \nPrivate Ryan,'' because of some of the language that is used in this \nextraordinarily heroic film that is one of the most accurate portrayals \nof the fog and heat of war that has ever been made.\n  At the same time, we find that ABC, in its leading up to Monday Night \nFootball, has fostered an advertisement to promote one of its nightly \nnetwork prime time shows in which a risque kind of setting is displayed \nfor an audience that would inappropriately include children, \nparticularly, who are watching at around 6 o'clock in the Pacific time \nzone of this country. On the one hand, ABC stations are taking off the \nair a movie that really has a great deal of portrayal of the strength \nof this country and all of its patriotic values and, at the same time, \nthe network, ABC, is then promoting what some would find questionable.\n  It seems to me we have lost our sense of balance, our sense of \ndirection, that it is entirely upside down as to what we should be \ndoing.\n  So, too, I have noted in a Washington newspaper today the fact that \nSecretary of Defense Rumsfeld is urged to defend the Boy Scout \nmovement, the title of the headline, and of which critics are pointing \nout that a settlement by the Department of Defense of an ACLU suit back \na few years ago is going to continue to drive, to force the military to \ncut off all taxpayer support to the Boy Scouts of America which, in \nthis case, uses military bases for meetings and events, such as their \nannual Boy Scout jamboree that is held on a Virginia military base.\n  It seems that we have it, again, upside down, for if the objection is \nthat the Boy Scouts of America have, as part of their oath, an \nallegiance to God, and if that is the reason for the suit, might I \nremind the Members of the Senate that when we took the oath of office, \nit said at the end of the oath, ``so help me God.''\n  But isn't it interesting that the U.S. military has taken a position \nin a settlement which, if taken to its logical conclusion, would keep \nthe Boy Scouts of America off a military facility when, in fact, every \nmilitary officer in the U.S. military, including this former officer of \nthe U.S. Army, took an oath that said the following:\n\n       That I will support and defend the Constitution of the \n     United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that \n     I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I \n     take this obligation freely without any mental reservation or \n     purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully \n     discharge the duties of this office upon which I am about to \n     enter, so help me God.\n\n  That is the part of the oath every U.S. military officer takes, and \nit is the one I took decades ago when I entered as an officer of the \nU.S. Army.\n  It seems to me there is a great deal of inconsistency then that the \nU.S. Department of Defense would take a position where every one of its \nofficers has sworn to uphold their oath, and at the end of that oath \nstate, ``so help me God,'' and yet they are moving to a position to \nknock the Boy Scouts out of being able to use public facilities--in \nthis case, military facilities--because they have a similar oath.\n  I come back to my opening comments. We have something that is upside \ndown. There is not a Senator here who does not passionately believe in \nfreedom of expression, freedom of speech, and freedom of belief in what \nany person chooses to believe, but are we getting so mixed up that we \nlose sight of what are the accepted ways in which we conduct ourselves \nand the respect we have for one another in our respective beliefs?\n  Really, is there anyone who wants to kick the Boy Scouts out of their \nannual jamboree on a Virginia military facility? Of course there isn't.\n  In this week that has just passed where we see the ABC network saying \nto some of these stations that we are not going to allow ``Private \nRyan'' because it has bad words in it, and at the same time promoting a \ncommercial that certainly has questionable viewing characteristics for \nyoung children at the 6 o'clock timeframe on the west coast of this \ncountry, and where today's news is bringing us to the point at which \nour own Department of Defense is taking a position that ultimately \nwould lead to kicking off the Boy Scouts because the Boy Scouts believe \nin God, then I think this country has gone too far. It is time to stand \nup and speak out about common sense and principles that were set in \nplace for this country by its Founding Fathers of a belief in Divine \nProvidence and a respect for that belief.\n\n  So what I will be doing is offering a resolution to the Senate today, \nand that resolution will conclude that:\n\n       It is the sense of the United States Senate that the \n     Department of Defense should continue to exercise its \n     longstanding statutory authority to support the activities of \n     the Boy Scouts of America, in particular the periodic \n     national and world Boy Scout jamboree.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns).

Mr. President, the late Senator Paul Coverdell was a \ngreat Senator and dear friend of many of us in this body. His untimely \npassing left a great hole in our hearts. But it also took from Georgia \nand from America a great leader.\n  At the time, none of us had any idea how we would ever manage without \nhim. I remember when we were doing tributes to him after his death. \nThere was great emotion on the floor of the Senate. I remember Senator \nPhil Gramm tearfully giving Senator Coverdell a farewell. We all felt \ngreat affection for him.\n  So when the Governor of Georgia, Governor Barnes, needed someone to \nstep into Paul Coverdell's place to be the voice for Georgia, he called \nupon a fellow whom I had not previously met but had heard of for some \ntime, former Gov. Zell Miller.\n  Happily retired and without personal ambition for further public \noffice, Zell Miller responded to the call of duty. And what a \ndifference he has made in this body. In a time of turmoil, a time of \nterrorist attacks, of economic challenge, of foreign war, when America \nneeded somebody to lead, Providence blessed America with a great \nSenator, Zell Miller.\n  During his short tenure here, this old marine has been critical to \nour efforts to obtain economic opportunity, homeland security, and \nnational security for this Nation. I can say with total certainty that \nPaul Coverdell would be proud--proud--of the accomplishments of Zell \nMiller. They have been good for Georgia, and they have been good for \nAmerica.\n  A review of every major battle this administration had in the last 4 \nyears shows that Zell Miller was in the middle of each one and the \nlinchpin to each success. Zell Miller was instrumental to the economic \nrecovery our Nation now enjoys. Zell Miller was the key to the homeland \nsecurity our Nation has attained. Zell Miller was one of the strongest \nvoices to harden our Nation's resolve to fully wage the war against \nterrorism. On these, the most critical issues upon which history will \njudge this Nation, this President, and this Congress, it was Zell \nMiller whose vote and voice made the difference.\n  Zell made the difference when the numbers didn't add up to victory. \nLike our mutual friend, Phil Gramm, apparently being outnumbered was \nnever a cause for concern to Zell. Zell served in the proud line of \nTruman Democrats. Like Harry Truman, he called for unity during a time \nof war and, like\n\n[[Page S11447]]\n\nHarry Truman, gave hell to anybody who played games with our national \nsecurity.\n  Like John Kennedy, he knew that tax cuts were not just good for the \neconomy but they were good for the take-home-pay of workers and their \nfamilies. But from Zell we didn't just hear the thoughts of old-school \nDemocrats, we also rediscovered the truths of our Nation. He showed us \nthat integrity still matters, that nation comes before party, and that \nthinking first of our children and grandchildren is the right and \nproper way to judge national policy. Any time Zell looked for his \nbearings, he gazed to those fixed stars of his favorite constellation: \nHis wife Shirley, his children, his seven grandchildren, and two great-\ngrandchildren. This internal compass served him well because no one \ncould ever accuse Zell of being confused about what he believed in and \nwhy.\n  So Zell Miller heads back to the Appalachian Mountains of north \nGeorgia, whence he came. He returns with his wife Shirley back to the \nbase of Double Knob Mountains, where the ravines flow to the Brasstown \nCreek and then the Hiawassee River and on to the Gulf of Mexico. He \nreturns to the dirt roads he walked as a lad, where he worked with his \nmother, to haul stones from a nearby field to build a rock-walled house \nwith no rafter, no subfloor, and a ladder for a staircase in which he \nwas raised.\n  From such modest beginnings, and such a modest man, the world is \nbetter because of his leadership. He stands as a lesson for all and for \nall time. Because of Zell Miller, I can say, be you a Senator, a \ncollege graduate, a single mother, or an elementary school student, \nnever, never, never doubt the impact a single person with clear vision \nand a strong heart can make for your family, your community, your \nnation, and, yes, your world--not just for now but for generations to \ncome.\n  So, Senator Miller, we will miss you around here.\n  Mr. President, we have had the privilege over the last 4 years to \nserve with a truly great American who has made a difference in a body \nin which it is very difficult for an individual Senator to frequently \nmake a difference. Farewell, Senator Miller. We look forward to seeing \nyou in the coming years.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina). The Senator \nfrom Alabama.\n\n\n                              Zell Miller\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the assistant majority leader \nfor his fine words. I certainly agree with those about Zell Miller. \nDemocracies in general, America in particular, seem blessed that in \ntimes of turmoil, leaders do step forward and give us the guidance we \nneed. During a time of war and economic challenge, America got such a \nleader in Zell Miller. It is not too much to say that he was the key, \nthe very hinge upon which much of the fate of the agenda of the last \nseveral years swung. For the goals of President Bush, from homeland \nsecurity to economic growth to the war on terrorism, Zell Miller has \nbeen the difference between victory and defeat, the gap between almost \nand barely.\n  I think part of the willingness of Senator Miller to step forward, \nbreak ranks, and support President Bush came because he is a man of \nexperience and judgment and integrity. He got to know President Bush. \nHe looked into his heart, he examined his policies, and he believed \nhim. He had a particular belief in this man at this point in history, \nbased on his study of history, his writing, and his experience, and he \nwas willing to step forward in an unusual degree and take a lot of \ngrief for it, to stand up for what he believed was right.\n  When President Bush proposed a tax cut to get the economy moving in \n2001, and things were not going well, Zell Miller was the first \nDemocrat to support that plan. He cosponsored the bill with Phil Gramm \nof Texas, a great Senator. When they teamed up I thought of that slogan \nin the Alabama football network. Bear Bryant would have a TV show every \nweek to talk about the game. He promoted Coca-Cola from Georgia, I \nguess, and Golden Flake potato chips, and the slogan was: ``Great Pair \nSays the Bear.'' So when Zell Miller and Phil Gramm joined forces, it \nwas indeed a great pair. When it came time to protect the homeland \nagainst terrorist attacks, it was Zell Miller who stood with the \nPresident in 2002 to make sure we had a Department that functioned more \nlike the Pentagon than the post office in protecting the lives of \nAmerican citizens. After 4 months and 11 votes and a national election, \nfinally it took. We passed the Homeland Security bill that has \nsucceeded in keeping us safe, since 9/11, at least--a feat not many \nwould have predicted possible at the time.\n  I would just say this: Senator Miller understood the importance of \nthat issue. I believe he called three press conferences. He urged those \nwho were blocking the Homeland Security bill for some sort of internal \ngovernmental union-type politics, not on the real merits--he warned \nthem that this was bad. It was bad for America, and it was bad \npolitically for those who blocked it.\n  They didn't listen. I think they wished they had. Certainly, after \nthe election they were quite willing to pass the bill they had been \nblocking before the election.\n  When the economy slowed down due to the attacks and the corporate \nscandal, and it came time to accelerate the tax cuts in 2003, once \nagain it was Zell Miller who made the economic incentive plan the law \nof the land.\n  On the question of judges for America, Zell Miller had the classical \nview of the role of a judge consistent with his good friend, the \nwonderful Judge Griffin Bell, who was a court of appeals judge and also \nAttorney General of the United States under President Jimmy Carter. He \nfollows that philosophy. As a matter of fact, he analyzed each nominee \nwho came forward and I believe saw fit to support the nominees, \nconsistently, that President Bush sent forward--not because of politics \nbut because he believed those judges would follow the law, not make \nlaw. They would be constructionists, not activists.\n\n  Oftentimes, on each one of these issues it came down to this one man \nmaking the difference, either taking the lead or casting the key vote \non those issues. He taught us once again that nation, family, faith, \nheritage, and principle are more important than politics and party. In \nthis he reaffirmed the belief that government for, of, and by the \npeople can work.\n  When he spoke, people listened. I will tell you why people listened. \nI asked him how he found time, how he did his speeches. He personally \nwrites his speeches. It is not written by staff. It is not generated by \nsome computer. It is not regurgitated from some document or some \nmemorandum or some summary somewhere. It comes from his heart, his \nexperience, his head, and his understanding of this great Republic of \nwhich we are blessed to be a part. That is why people listen to his \nspeeches.\n  Most of us recall his speech in New York at the convention, where he, \nin Trumanesque fashion, blasted those who play games with our national \ndefense. They squalled and thought it was hell. He was just telling the \ntruth, I suggest.\n  It was clear, passionate, and powerful and helped change the course \nof the national debate. It changed the course of the national debate \nbecause it was true. What he said was important. It had to do with \nwhether this Nation would have leadership committed to a strong \nAmerica. He also had some very fine words right here on the floor of \nthe Senate.\n  On the Energy bill, he rose in ``defense of that great American \nworkhorse,'' in his words, the pickup truck. He told a story of meeting \na guy who was a PHD--that is a post hole digger--who said:\n\n       If you really want to know when times are bad, take notice \n     of the number of people having to sell their pickups. Look at \n     the ads in the paper and the ``for sale'' signs in the yards. \n     The more you see, the worse it is because pickups are the \n     very symbol of the working man. As the pickup goes, so does \n     the working man and the very heart of this country.\n\n  He added:\n\n       Pickups are as essential to the carpenter as his hammer; as \n     essential to the painter as his paintbrush. So we must leave \n     this American workhorse, the pickup truck, alone. Don't pick \n     on the pickup.\n\n  Then he shared with us a tune called ``Talking Pickup Truck Blues.'' \nHe spared us the agony of singing it, but he did share one verse.\n\n\n[[Page S11448]]\n\n\n       Sure, an SUV is classy travel, but it ain't much good for \n     hauling gravel, or hay or bovine feces. So please do not make \n     my pickup truck an endangered species.\n\n  That is not often heard on the floor of this Senate--words of \neloquence that bring a smile to us all but more than that drives home a \ntruth about real people who serve America day after day in pickup \ntrucks.\n  So this man knows America. Given all the good he has done in so \nlittle time--he has given so much to it--he leaves much too soon. He \nhas done a great job for this Nation and for Georgia in replacing the \ndeparted Paul Coverdell who we all loved and admired. He has been a \ngreat leader and a great Senator, and the Senate will miss the presence \nof this old Marine sergeant.\n  I can say without contradiction I believe that few Senators in the \nhistory of this Republic have in one short term contributed so much to \nthe health and welfare of our Nation and made such a tremendous impact \non it.\n  It is because he put his Nation first; he stood for what we believe \nin. He was true to his raising.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, I have listened with a grateful heart to \nthe generous words of my colleagues, the Senator from Kentucky and \nearlier this morning the Senator from Alabama. I will remember and \ncherish those words as long as I am on this Earth. I thank each of them \nfor their friendship.\n  I see my good friend from Montana on the floor. I thank him, a fellow \nmarine, for his friendship.\n  This means more to me than I have words to express. I did not come to \nthis Senate expecting events to unfold as they have. I guess I am \nliving proof that politics is not an exact science.\n  In Shakespeare's ``Hamlet,'' his friend Laertes is going off to \ncollege and his father Polonius is giving him the usual advise that you \ngive when your sons go off to college. After all the words of caution \nthat I hope fathers still give their sons, Polonius ended with these \nwords:\n\n       This above all: to thine ownself be true,\n       And it must follow, as the night the day,\n       Thou canst not then be false to any man.\n\n  I have always believed that and I have tried to live that.\n  I have had a most blessed personal life--personal and political. \nSince 1959, voters in Georgia have been putting me in one office or \nanother, and I am deeply grateful to them.\n  God has richly blessed my personal life. My wife Shirley has been the \nperfect partner for over 50 years. She has been my companion, my \ncritic, my crutch. We have two wonderful sons, Murphy and Matthew, and \nour daughters-in-law and our grandchildren and our great-grandchildren. \nWe are very blessed.\n  If he had lived, Paul Coverdell would be ending his second 6-year \nterm. As I told some of my colleagues last night, not a day has gone by \nsince I have been here that I have not thought of this good man who \nleft us so suddenly and so tragically.\n  My most fervent hope during these 4\\1/2\\ years has been that Paul \nwould be pleased with the way I have served and finished out his term. \nI know Paul is pleased, as I am, that our mutual friend Johnny Isakson, \none of the finest public servants I have ever known, will soon be our \nsuccessor in this great body.\n  I also wish to say what an honor it has been to serve the last 2 \nyears with my colleague from Georgia, Senator Saxby Chambliss.\n  Now as this page turns on the final chapter of my career as a public \nservant, I cannot help but remember how it was in that first chapter of \nmy life. Growing up in a remote Appalachian valley, we lived in a house \nmade of rocks my mother gathered from a nearby creek with only an open \nfireplace for heat, no indoor plumbing, no car, no phone, and no \nfather.\n  On summer nights before the TVA dammed up the Hiawassee River and \nbrought electricity to that Appalachian valley, after the Moon had come \nup over the mountain, the lightning bugs were blinking, while the frogs \ncroaked down at the creek and the katydids sang, every once in a while \na whippoorwill's lonesome cry could be heard.\n  I remember after my mother had finally quit working and was getting \nus quiet and ready to go to bed, we would play a game. The game would \nstart when the headlights of that rare car would penetrate the \ndarkness, maybe once every half hour or so on that narrow strip of \nasphalt across a big ditch in front of our house. We would stare at the \nheadlights of the car as it made its way around the steep curves and \nfinally over Brasstown Mountain. We would count and see how long it \ntook from the time it went by our house until its taillights would \ndisappear through that distant gap and was no longer a part of that one \nand only world I knew.\n  It was often at this time my mother would laugh and say, ``You know \nwhat's so great about this place? You can get anywhere in the world \nfrom here.''\n  That world has turned many times since I first traveled that narrow \nroad through that gap and out of that valley. It has been a long road \nwith many twists and turns, ups and downs, bumps, and, yes, a few \nwrecks, a road that twice carried me to the highest office of the ninth \nlargest State in this Nation, to all the continents and famous cities \nof the world and, finally, to the Senate.\n\n  So I leave this Senate, knowing that once again my mother has been \nproved right. One could get anywhere in the world from that little \nmountain valley and back again. Everywhere I have ever been really was \non my way back home.\n  I thank all of you. I thank my family. I thank my very special staff \nwho has stayed with me through thick and thin. I thank my friends and \nespecially my God. It has been one heck of a ride.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I wish to say a few words about my friend \nfrom Georgia, Senator Miller, who preceded my remarks.\n  I was raised in the Midwest. We both come out of an era of rural \nAmerica. It was a different life. I remember when we did not have \nelectricity. We did not live on a gravel road. We did not have running \nwater in the house. In fact, the water bucket froze on cold winter \nnights. We didn't have the best clothes in the world. But they were \nclean. And I have never gone to bed hungry.\n  I have an idea my mother was kind of like Mrs. Miller. A home full of \nlove on a badlands farm made up of two rocks and one dirt, trying to \nhang on to it, coming out of tough times called the Depression of the \ndirty 1930s. It shaped a lot of character. It put a lot of fiber in a \nlot of people who went on to love this country and would serve her and \nour States at any cost.\n  The highest compliment one could pay to any person we meet in this \nbody, comes from the West in an expression that says: We'll not say \ngoodbye; we'll just say so long because you are welcome to sit at my \nfire anytime.\n  That is my feeling toward this old marine. I only have one \ndisappointment, that we never did get a trip to the Pacific to visit \nIwo Jima. I have been there but he never got to go. We tried every way \nin the world. We had a couple trips scrubbed because of business in the \nSenate. We never did make it, but we are not going to give up.\n  So we say so long to Zell Miller, a good friend, a good Senator, a \ngreat representative of Georgia, and a great representative of this \ncountry.\n  I came down here today to talk about other men who will be leaving \nthis Senate, including Senator Hollings from South Carolina. He was \nchairman of the Commerce Committee when I first came here in 1988 and \n1989. I was up to my eyes in confusion, trying to drink out of a fire \nhydrant to take it all in. My former chairman of the Commerce Committee \nwas part of my education, a very important part of it, in understanding \nthe work done in the committees and this business of setting policy \nthat conforms to the wants and desires of our States and what is good \nfor the country.\n  One time I offered a little amendment that had a far-reaching effect \nin the debate of regulating the cable industry. I didn't want to do \nthat but I wanted to give him a little competition to make them better. \nI offered an amendment without telling anybody on the committee, \nwithout telling a soul.\n  I will tell the Presiding Officer I know what it is like to sit way \ndown at the end of the committee because when I came here my seniority \nwas S100.\n\n[[Page S11449]]\n\n  I remember the chairman, Mr. Hollings, saying, I've never heard of \nanything like that. It was pretty obvious we were going to have to go \nto a vote. He didn't know if he had enough votes to defeat it and I \ndidn't know if I had enough votes to pass it. An instance such as that \ncalls for a little backroom sit-down, talk about this, and see what it \ndoes to the issue.\n  I was right there with him. Senator Inouye from Hawaii was also in \nthe meeting. One can start to learn the ways of the Senate especially \nin the areas of committee work.\n  I will miss Ernest Hollings because he has been an institution here \nserving from the 89th through the 108th Congress. That is a great \ntradition.\n\n  The Presiding Officer knows and understands Ernest Hollings. We may \ndisagree on philosophy but we did not disagree on America.\n  Don Nickles will leave this Senate in this year, having arrived in \n1980 with President Ronald Reagan. The real voice of conservatism, a \nfiscal conservative, who stood in this Senate and fought wasteful \nspending and did it with grace, did it with knowledge, a leader among \nall.\n  There again, he being 8 years ahead of me, he was a mentor and \nsomeone I could look to, study and learn from.\n  In 1987 or 1986, Tom Daschle came to the Senate. A neighbor from \nSouth Dakota from Aberdeen, SD, we both learned a little bit here. He \nwas much more successful than I, reaching into leadership of his party. \nWe had a lot of common friends in South Dakota. I will be sorry to see \nTom Daschle leave the Senate. But he has left big tracks here. There \nare fond memories on issues that we agreed on and issues that we did \nnot agree, but we did not do it being disagreeable.\n  Bob Graham from Florida I learned was in the Angus business and he \nleaves this year.\n  John Breaux from Louisiana. I worked with him on the Commerce \nCommittee regarding energy issues. His wisdom will be missed.\n  I am afraid I took much more from these men than I could ever return \nto them.\n  I served only one term with John Edwards and Peter Fitzgerald. They, \ntoo, will be missed in the Senate. Their contribution was huge.\n  Ben Nighthorse Campbell served from the 103rd to the 108th Congress. \nBut my, the knowledge he has had and the experiences he has had.\n  It seems as if he has always ridden dangerous things, including old \nbroncs and horses, which are unpredictable, and, you might say, not the \nsafest things. What a great thrill being the cover Senator for Harley \nDavidson. He, too, has lived a great life. He, too, understands the \nWest. He is also a member of the Northern Cheyenne Tribe. The \nreservation is in my State of Montana.\n  We campaigned together, learned from each other. Now he will be \nreturning back to his Colorado, back to the High Country. He is looking \nforward to that.\n  Peter Fitzgerald comes from Illinois. As to all of these men, I want \nto say you do form relationships here, and there is a certain bond that \nattracts us all, as we learn that even though you may be on the same \nside of the aisle or the opposite side of the aisle, one could always \nagree or disagree without being disagreeable. That is what makes the \nSenate a special place.\n  We will miss all of these men, but I am looking forward to those who \ntake their place as, there again, new relationships will be developed, \na new bond dealing with the old challenges of a free society, with \nthose who love the Constitution and love this country who were prepared \nto die for it and would if asked to do so today. No one doubts the \ndepth of their patriotism nor their service to their country. We \nwelcome them as we say goodbye to old friends, old relationships that \nwill never be forgotten.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak for up to ten minutes in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is in morning business. The Senator \nfrom Tennessee is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/18/senate-section/article/S11449-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11449-S11453]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         1989 EDUCATION SUMMIT\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, right after the election, on November \n3, 2004, I went to the Miller Center at the University of Virginia. The \npurpose of the occasion was a discussion of the 1989 Education Summit. \nIt had been 15 years since the President of the United States and the \nNation's Governors--all of our chief executives--gathered in \nCharlottesville, VA, to establish the first ever national education \ngoals for our country.\n  It is astonishing to me that 15 years have gone by since then, and it \nwas to most other governors who were there. It was important to look \nback on what had happened in 1989, to see how it happened, and to think \nabout what happened since then.\n  The summit at the University of Virginia had gone remarkably well. \nPresident George H.W. Bush had convened it. Terry Bransted, the \nGovernor of Iowa, was chairman of the National Governors Association \nthat year. He had appointed the Governor from Arkansas, Bill Clinton, \nwhose library is opening today, and Carroll Campbell of South Carolina \nas the lead Governors. Working with the President's representatives, \nthey came up with those first national education goals. There had been \na long prelude to all of this activity in 1989. I was a part of that \nprelude, and I saw a lot of it happen.\n  In 1978, when I was elected Governor and Bill Clinton was elected \nGovernor of Arkansas, and Dick Riley of South Carolina, and our \ncolleague, Bob Graham, who was Governor of Florida, we were all faced \nwith the same issues. Our States were behind; the world was changing, \nand we needed a better education system, particularly at the elementary \nand secondary level. So that by 1983, when the report of the U.S. \nDepartment of Education, called ``A Nation at Risk,'' came out saying \nwe were greatly at risk because of the mediocrity of the education \nsystem, it was into that environment that it came.\n  The Governors in 1985 and 1986 all worked for a year on education. I \nwas chairman of the NGA that year, and Bill Clinton was the vice \nchairman. It was the first time in the history of the governors \norganization that we all focused for a year on one subject. Then, by \n1989, we had a President of the United States, George H.W. Bush, who \nbecame the first of three consecutive Presidents to say he wanted to be \nan education President. The goals that the governors adopted with the \nPresident in 1989 were very straightforward.\n  No. 1, all children in America will start school ready to learn.\n  No. 2, high school graduates will increase to 90 percent.\n  No. 3, American students will leave the fourth, eighth, and twelfth \ngrades having demonstrated competency in math, science, English, \nhistory, and geography.\n  No. 4, America would be first in the world in math and science.\n  No. 5, adult Americans would be literate.\n  No. 6, every school would be free of drugs and violence.\n  Those were the goals. You might say after a decade of unprecedented \nschool reform and concern, America backed into its goals for reform. \nThat was 15 years ago. A lot has happened since then.\n  When I became Education Secretary in 1991, we created something \ncalled America 2000, which was to try to move America community by \ncommunity toward those national education goals. Governor Clinton \nbecame President Clinton, and he changed the name to Goals 2000 and \ntried his brand of moving us in that direction.\n  Now we have another President, the son of the man for whom I worked, \nwho has, through No Child Left Behind, working in a bipartisan way, \ntried to set from Washington accountability standards that will help \nmake sure that all children are learning. I rise to talk about this \ntoday only for this reason: That the national summit of governors and \nthe President, on its 15th anniversary, should not go by without \nmentioning it on this floor.\n  There has never been anything like it before. One of the most \nimportant\n\n[[Page S11450]]\n\nparts of it was that members of Congress were not involved. A lot of \nmembers of Congress--it was a Democratic legislature at that time--were \nnot very happy about that. But I think that was the correct decision \nbecause, in my view, elementary and secondary education is a national \nconcern, central to almost everything important that we do, but it is \nnot necessarily a Federal Government concern.\n  The fact that the governors and the President, the chief executives \nof our country, met together to establish these goals and begin to move \nus toward those goals was, I think, the correct way to do that.\n  I would like to salute the University of Virginia's Miller Center for \nholding this celebration. It included former Education Secretary Dick \nRiley, Rod Paige, the current Education Secretary, and I was there as \nwell. It also included John Sununu, a former Governor of New Hampshire, \nwho was at the education summit and who was Chief of Staff at the White \nHouse at the time it was organized, and Jerry Baliles, the former \nGovernor of Virginia, who was Governor of Virginia at the time the \neducation summit was held.\n  I thought Governor Baliles' remarks were especially interesting and \nuseful. He talked about the political context of the times and how the \ngovernors were able to do this without interference from Congressmen \nand Senators in Washington, DC. He talked about the competitiveness of \nour country and the world, and how we are driven to realize that better \nschools meant better jobs and that most of our standard of living \ndepends upon the research, the inventions, and technology that we have \nat our great system of colleges and universities in the world. And, he \ntalked about where we had come in the last 15 years.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record, following my remarks, \nthe full remarks of the Honorable Gerald L. Baliles, the former \nGovernor of Virginia, which he made at the Miller Center of Public \nAffairs and the Curry School of Education in Charlottesville on \nNovember 4, 2004.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I think it is worthwhile, in addition \nto this, to give a little credit to former President George H.W. Bush. \nI still believe that when the dust settles and history books are \nwritten, President Bush's leadership in education will be among his \nmost significant and lasting contributions.\n  His tour of duty was interrupted by the voters in 1992, so he was not \nable to finish the job. But his America 2000 community effort had a \nvariety of initiatives which set the agenda for American education in \nthe 1990s. They included a new set of national standards in core \ncurriculum subjects, including science, history, English, geography, \narts, civics, and foreign languages. It included a national voluntary \nexamination system geared to those new standards. They included new \ngeneration, thousands of start-from-scratch, ``break-the-mold \nschools.'' We call them today charter schools, but then there were only \nperhaps ten such charter schools. It included giving teachers more \nautonomy and flexibility in their classrooms by waiving federal rules \nand regulations, something Congress eventually did more of later. It \nalso included a GI bill for children, to give middle and low-income \nfamilies $1,000 scholarships to spend at any lawfully operated school \nof their choice, thereby giving those parents more of the same choices \nthat wealthy parents already had.\n  That was an excellent agenda in the early 1990s. It is still a good \nagenda today. The summit on education, the national education goals \ncreated in 1989, need to be remembered, and so does the leadership of \nPresident George W. Bush on education.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n  The Remarks of The Honorable Gerald L. Baliles, Former Governor of \n Virginia and Partner, Hunton & Williams, before the Miller Center of \n  Public Affairs and The Curry School of Education, The University of \n         Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia, November 4, 2004\n\n\n               the 1989 education summit: a reevaluation\n\n       At the beginning of the 1992 Vice Presidential debate, Ross \n     Perot's running mate, Admiral Stockdale, opened the debate by \n     looking into the camera and saying, ``Who am I and why am I \n     here?''\n       Today, I am here because 15 years ago I, along with the \n     rest of the nation's governors, met with the first President \n     Bush and his cabinet for an unprecedented Education Summit \n     here at the University of Virginia.\n       I am a strong believer in the importance of context; in the \n     notion that to truly understand an event or a series of \n     events, one must understand the times in which those events \n     occurred. And that is my role here today.\n       The agenda is filled with Education Secretaries, educators \n     and others who have played a critical role in how the results \n     of the Summit were implemented. They have been on the front \n     lines of education in the fifteen years since the Summit, \n     while I retired from public office just three and-a-half \n     months after the Summit's conclusion. I look forward to their \n     assessments of the progress made and the challenges that \n     confront us.\n       1 believe that former New Hampshire Governor and White \n     House Chief of Staff John Sununu and I are the only ones here \n     who actually attended the Summit, and all of its meetings, as \n     principal participants. So it is that the Miller Center has \n     asked me to provide some context, to discuss what was going \n     on at the time, why the meeting was held, what battles were \n     going on behind the scenes, and what our expectations were \n     for the Summit.\n       I am delighted to be here today to share the program with \n     Governor Warner, Secretary Paige and so many others who have \n     advanced the cause of education in our country.\n       I just mentioned John Sununu. 1 served as Vice Chair of the \n     National Governors Association under John and then succeeded \n     him as Chairman. Not long after that, John joined President \n     Bush in Washington as his Chief of Staff. One of the best \n     things about that 1989 summit was the opportunity to see and \n     work with John again, and I am delighted he is here today for \n     this retrospective event.\n       It is also a pleasure to be here with my former colleagues \n     Dick Riley and Lamar Alexander. I remember well my first \n     National Governors' Association Meeting, in August, 1986, \n     hosted by Governor Dick Riley at Hilton Head, South Carolina \n     and chaired by a Tennessee Governor named Lamar Alexander. \n     The major theme of the meeting was education; the NGA had \n     done a great deal of work on education reform during Governor \n     Alexander's chairmanship and the results were being released.\n       Lamar Alexander and Dick Riley, through their work as \n     Governors and later as U.S. Secretaries of Education, have \n     done more than any two people I can think of to advance the \n     cause of quality education in the United States over the past \n     quarter century. We all owe them a tremendous debt.\n       Now to the task at hand.\n       You might recall that the 1989 Summit was greeted with \n     equal measures of anticipation and cynicism, hope and \n     skepticism. Many noted at the time that Americans \n     periodically make brave and impressive noises about \n     education, but that we frequently fail to achieve the \n     necessary breakthroughs to give education the priority it \n     merits.\n       No question, some expected the Charlottesville Summit to be \n     little more than a variation on disappointing earlier \n     efforts. But others--and I counted myself among them--\n     believed that something different and important could happen \n     here, something which might foretell a favorable turning \n     point in our national commitment to education.\n       The day before leaving Richmond to come to Charlottesville \n     for the Summit, I made the following observation at a press \n     conference: ``While it seems unlikely to me that fundamental \n     solutions to the problems of education will emerge out of a \n     meeting that will last little more than 24 hours, the Summit \n     could well be the start of a significant national effort.''\n       Fifteen years later, I believe the Summit was not only the \n     start of a significant national effort, but in many ways was \n     a seminal event; nationalizing the importance of educational \n     policy, sharpening the focus on results, and making executive \n     political leadership more important.\n       To understand why, and to understand the context in which \n     the Summit was held, I want to focus on three factors in \n     particular:\n       First, I want to focus on the political context of the \n     time. Much of the media and public reaction to the Summit \n     centered around political questions--especially in the days \n     leading up to the Summit. How much of the Summit was designed \n     to cater to the President's political needs? How did Congress \n     view the Summit? What did the Governors expect? What tensions \n     existed between the different levels of government? Those \n     questions were being posed at the time, and it is important \n     to examine them.\n       Second, I want to look at the substantive context of the \n     time. There was consensus across the political spectrum in \n     1989 that the United States faced a challenge, almost a \n     crisis, of international competitiveness. While people of \n     various political stripes disagreed sharply on specific \n     remedies, it had become conventional wisdom that, by a \n     variety of international measures, including educational \n     achievement, the United States was not as competitive as most \n     of its trading partners and competitors in the global \n     economy, and was falling further behind. This may be \n     difficult to comprehend today, but the fact is that the \n     competitiveness issue\n\n[[Page S11451]]\n\n     permeated most political debates of that time, and much of \n     the educational reform effort in the Nation was fueled by \n     competitiveness concerns.\n       Finally, I want to look at the debate over the Federal role \n     in education. In 1989, the very idea of a Federal role in \n     education was still an open question. Today, we largely argue \n     over what form the Federal role should take and how much it \n     will cost. Very few will question the Federal role. We do not \n     challenge the need for national standards or a national \n     approach to educational policy. Back then, things were quite \n     different, and the Summit played a major role--perhaps THE \n     major role--in settling the basic question of whether there \n     should be a Federal role in education.\n       I want to focus on those three factors of politics, \n     competitiveness and the Federal educational role because they \n     really laid the foundation for much of what has followed, \n     both at the State and Federal levels. And, yes, that includes \n     Virginia's ``Standards of Learning'' and the Federal ``No \n     Child Left Behind'' legislation.\n\n\n                                politics\n\n       Let's begin with the political dimension.\n       It is well known that during the 1988 campaign, the then-\n     Vice President Bush had proclaimed that he'd like to be known \n     as the ``Education President.'' There was a belief, I think, \n     that this would not only allow him to compete for voters the \n     Democratic nominee was taking for granted, but that it would \n     also allow the Vice President to set himself apart from \n     President Reagan whose rhetoric and budgets, especially in \n     the early years, demonstrated opposition to Federal \n     involvement in education.\n       If that was President Bush's strategy, it worked. His \n     opponent in 1988, Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis, \n     took the education issue somewhat for granted and the Vice \n     President was able to use it to his advantage. For those who \n     feared a replay of Reagan-era proposals to eliminate the \n     Department of Education, the new President's words assuaged \n     their worries.\n       When President Bush talked of a ``kinder, gentler'' \n     administration, many believed that he was talking about \n     education. Yet, when President Bush went on to observe, in \n     his inaugural address, that the U.S. Government had ``more \n     will than wallet'' in the face of mounting needs AND mounting \n     deficits, many worried that he would walk away from his \n     commitment to education.\n       Indeed, the first several months of the Bush administration \n     saw little or no action in the education area. This was \n     understandable. A new administration was getting organized, \n     momentous things were beginning to happen in Eastern Europe \n     and the Soviet Union, and pro democracy demonstrators spent \n     the spring of that year camped out in Tianamen Square in \n     Beijing.\n       In addition, hostages were being taken in the Middle East. \n     The budget deficit was increasing rapidly. There were many \n     serious international priorities. That nothing was happening \n     on education should not have been a surprise, though the fact \n     did give rise to some grumbling and increased pressure on the \n     Bush Administration to do something.\n       When President Bush came to Chicago in August, 1989 to \n     address the annual meeting of the National Governors \n     Association, there was much to talk about--in fact, the major \n     story in the news the day he visited concerned the death of a \n     U.S. hostage taken in the Middle East.\n       Indeed, the President broke the news of the hostage's death \n     to the public at the beginning of his speech to the \n     Governors. But during the course of his remarks, he announced \n     that he would meet with the Governors in a ``Summit'' \n     sometime that fall to discuss education. It would be only the \n     third time a President would meet in a specially-called, \n     Summit-type, meeting with Governors, and the first time that \n     the subject would be education. The exact time and place had \n     not then been determined, nor had the University of Virginia \n     been selected as the site of the Summit.\n       Naturally, there were pundits who believed that the meeting \n     would be nothing more than a photo opportunity; a chance for \n     the President to quiet criticism of himself for not spending \n     as much time on education as some people wanted. It was \n     summertime, Congress was out of session, and after the \n     National Governors' Association meeting there was little hard \n     news for the press to focus on, at least in the domestic \n     arena. So, people were free to speculate about the \n     President's motives for holding the Summit, and about the \n     agenda for the meeting.\n       About two weeks after the President had proposed the \n     meeting, the White House announced that the Summit would be \n     held here at the University of Virginia, and that it would be \n     held at the end of September, about a month later. The fact \n     that we now had a specific set of dates, and a location, only \n     raised the intensity of the debate, as well as the political \n     temperature.\n       To begin with, Congress was unhappy about being excluded \n     from the discussion. Up until 1989, Federal education policy \n     was primarily a congressional concern. Presidents might \n     express opinions but otherwise were reduced mostly to signing \n     bills passed by Congress. Here was a President who had \n     proposed to alter that balance, who made it clear that the \n     Summit was limited to himself and the 50 State Governors \n     and the Governors of the territories.\n       Congressional leaders, particularly the chairmen of the \n     education committees, were outraged--and not just at the \n     President. Relations between Congress and the Governors were \n     a little frayed at the time, particularly between Democratic \n     Governors and Democratic members of Congress.\n       At that Chicago NGA meeting that I chaired, 49 of the 50 \n     Governors signed a letter to congressional leaders asking for \n     a moratorium on new Medicaid mandates. Continued expansion of \n     Medicaid was exacting a major toll on State budgets around \n     the country, and the Governors were asking for a brief \n     moratorium on new mandates in order to find ways to fully \n     fund what was already in the pipeline.\n       Congressional leaders were incensed. Congressman Henry \n     Waxman, who chaired the subcommittee in charge of Medicaid, \n     wrote to all Democratic Governors accusing them of a variety \n     of sins for their position in support of a moratorium on new \n     Medicaid mandates. Things were especially tense between the \n     gubernatorial wing of the Democratic party and the \n     congressional wing (in those days, Democrats controlled both \n     houses of Congress).\n       So, there was the fear that congressional prerogatives were \n     being stripped away and anger at Governors, particularly \n     Democratic Governors, for being complicit in upsetting this \n     balance.\n       Congressional leaders found an ally in the then-Governor of \n     New York, Mario Cuomo. Governor Cuomo, who was also the only \n     Governor not to sign the Medicaid mandate letter, began \n     working with Senator Kennedy, Chairman of the Senate Human \n     Resources Committee, and Congressman Hawkins, his House \n     counterpart. They wanted Congressional leaders to participate \n     in the Summit since Congress would have to fund any Federal \n     initiatives, and they were also urging Democratic Governors \n     to go to the Summit with an agenda demanding full Federal \n     funding of a variety of programs, and the creation of several \n     new Federal programs as well.\n       Many of the Democratic Governors believed this approach to \n     be misguided, that if the Governors' conversation with the \n     President on education simply mirrored Washington's fights \n     over formulas and funding, then the public would view the \n     meeting skeptically, and we would lose an important \n     opportunity to articulate a national commitment to education.\n       Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton was the Lead Democratic \n     Governor for Education, and he and I worked together to \n     convince our Democratic gubernatorial colleagues of this \n     point of view. It was a difficult challenge and the outcome \n     was uncertain. Attempts were made by some to convince \n     individual Democratic Governors, and their staffs, that the \n     Summit was a clever trap devised by the administration to \n     ensure that no new resources would go into education.\n       In the end, we convinced most of the Democratic Governors \n     that the best way forward was an approach that focused on a \n     set of challenging goals and standards; stringent enough that \n     the goals could not be reached without a major financial \n     commitment at all levels of government.\n       We believed that if we just asked for more money, we would \n     lose the public debate; that people would not support money \n     divorced from results; that both needed to go hand-in-hand.\n       We believed, in short, that the best way to obtain \n     additional resources for education was to set goals that \n     could not be achieved without those new resources.\n       So, if one is looking for a reason why the major result of \n     the Summit was a commitment to develop national goals, this \n     is a good place to start.\n       In the meantime, the Republicans were having their own \n     discussions. Most of them also revolved around funding, with \n     the administration being wary of calls simply to provide more \n     Federal money. Congressional Republicans largely agreed with \n     the new administration in opposing more money, with some even \n     wanting to make cuts in education spending. Republican \n     Governors wanted to be supportive of their President in \n     holding the line against demands for major new cash \n     infusions, but they also realized that more resources were \n     required. Some of the most conservative Republicans were \n     concerned that the Summit would all but enshrine a Federal \n     role in education that they opposed.\n       In the end, Republican Governors came to a very similar \n     conclusion as their Democratic counterparts--that national \n     goals would be the best way forward. My impression was that \n     they were under much less pressure from their congressional \n     counterparts than the Democratic Governors were from \n     congressional Democrats; the pressure Republican Governors \n     faced came more from an administration not wanting to be \n     pressured into major new infusions of Federal money. But \n     Governors of both parties ultimately came to similar \n     conclusions prior to the Summit.\n       In today's partisan political climate, this bipartisan \n     consensus seems almost impossible to believe. There were many \n     reasons for this bipartisan convergence in thinking.\n       Perhaps it is because Governors have always been--or at \n     least were then--better able to work across Party lines than \n     members of Congress.\n       Perhaps it is because Governor Clinton and South Carolina \n     Governor Carroll Campbell, who was the Lead Republican \n     Governor for Education, got along so well or because Iowa \n     Governor Terry Brandstad and Washington Governor Booth \n     Gardner, the new Chairman\n\n[[Page S11452]]\n\n     and Vice Chairman respectively, of the National Governors \n     Association got along so well, or because we all got along \n     with John Sununu, who as White House Chief of Staff played a \n     major role in Summit preparations. Who knows?\n       The fact is, however, that the political needs and desires \n     of both Democratic and Republican Governors happened to \n     coincide in an important way at that time, and the Governors \n     went in to the Summit pretty much united over the need for \n     fairly aggressive national goals. It was, to resurrect a \n     phrase, a time of harmonic convergence.\n       And what about the White House? As I mentioned earlier, the \n     main political worry from the White House was that the Summit \n     would lead to intense pressure for a major infusion of new \n     Federal dollars. I remember, very specifically, that this was \n     the one non-negotiable demand from the White House--the \n     Summit would not be allowed to focus solely on discussions of \n     new Federal money.\n       Some on the White House staff wanted little more than a \n     statement saying that the President and Governors shared a \n     common commitment to education. Others believed that such a \n     result would be seen as inadequate and would merely confirm \n     the suspicion many had that the entire Summit was pure \n     politics.\n       I want to state, by the way, that my belief has always been \n     that President Bush was sincere in his desire to chart a new \n     way forward in education. This view was confirmed by what I \n     observed at the Summit and by conversations I had with the \n     President in the months and years after the Summit--including \n     a visit to Camp David a couple of years later. In this, he \n     had the effective assistance of John Sununu and, later, Lamar \n     Alexander. But there were some in the administration in \n     September, 1989, who advocated a minimalist approach, to say \n     the least.\n       But others at the White House, echoing the President, \n     believed that we had the opportunity to achieve more than a \n     ``Mom and Apple Pie'' joint statement on the value of \n     education. They were no more interested in committing the \n     administration to major new Federal spending than the \n     minimalists, but they did believe that we had a golden \n     opportunity to focus the country's attention on the need for \n     a shared national goal of education excellence.\n       Thus was the consensus born that the Summit would attempt \n     to articulate a set of national educational goals, or at \n     least begin a process in which such goals could be developed.\n       So, yes, politics was critically important to how the \n     Summit unfolded and concluded. But as my UVA friend Larry \n     Sabato likes to say, ``politics is a good thing.'' And in \n     this case, politics led to a shared approach and a \n     constructive outcome for educational reform.\n\n\n                             competiveness\n\n       Let me turn now to my second point, the substantive \n     international policy concerns of late 1989.\n       It is hard to remember now, with most of Europe and Japan \n     stuck in a decade-long economic funk, but in the late 1980's \n     the major issue hanging over the education debate--permeating \n     debates over everything in fact--was competitiveness. At the \n     time, the best way to get attention for one's issue was to \n     link it to the effort to make the American economy more \n     competitive on a global basis. The book shelves were filled \n     with tomes written by academics, journalists, politicians, \n     sports coaches and others about competitiveness.\n       Education was a major issue affected by the competitiveness \n     debate. The changes that so challenged the Nation--the \n     changes that inspired the Education Summit--were as much \n     external as they were internal. And they were viewed as quite \n     real, even threatening.\n       The case for viewing education in this light was first made \n     with the 1983 publication of ``A Nation at Risk.'' That \n     report completely transformed the education reform issue; it \n     began to nationalize the issue, and it placed education \n     firmly in the middle of the competitiveness debate.\n       Listen to the language in the opening paragraphs of that \n     report: ``[America's] once unchallenged preeminence in \n     commerce, industry, science, and technological innovation is \n     being overtaken by competitors throughout the world. . . . \n     [T]he educational foundations of our society are presently \n     being eroded by a rising tide of mediocrity that threatens \n     our very future as a Nation and as a people. . . . We have, \n     in effect, been committing an act of unthinking, unilateral \n     educational disarmament.''\n       Tough stuff. Of course, the intent of the words was to jolt \n     the public, the press and our political institutions out of \n     their complacency and remove the inertia of the status quo. \n     The fact that the report came from a panel created by \n     President Reagan's Secretary of Education, Terrell Bell, made \n     the words all the more powerful.\n       Well, if the intent was to jolt, it worked. Within just one \n     year of the report's release, 41 States had toughened high \n     school graduation requirements in line with the report's \n     recommendations. Thirty-five States had raised teacher \n     certification standards, twenty States had increased \n     instructional time and nineteen had improved school \n     discipline policies.\n       In 1986, the National Governors' Association released ``A \n     Time for Results.'' This report proposed a series of actions \n     to be completed by 1991--to strengthen teaching, increase the \n     use of technology and raise the level of local educational \n     standards. This report was to be updated each year in a \n     series called ``Results in Education.''\n       Also in 1986, the Southern Governors Association Advisory \n     Council on International Education released a report calling \n     for improvements in the teaching of languages, geography and \n     other international subjects. The report stated: ``By every \n     measure, Americans are not prepared to compete and to \n     participate in the international marketplace.'' The report \n     continued: ``We, as a nation, as constantly surprised by \n     world political and economic events. They occur in places we \n     never heard of, for reasons we do not understand.'' The title \n     of the report?\n\n\n                       Cornerstone of Competition\n\n       In 1987, the National Governors Association launched a \n     year-long initiative called ``Jobs, Growth and Competition'' \n     which focused on a variety of issues, including education, \n     that were deemed important to improving our international \n     competitiveness. In 1989, the National Governors' Association \n     launched an initiative during my chairmanship called \n     ``America in Transition, the International Frontier.'' The \n     final report was entitled ``A Competitive Nation.'' A \n     series of earlier reports had focused on a variety of \n     issues, including education.\n       But, this competitiveness concern wasn't just for \n     Governors. Congress and the President got in on the act as \n     well.\n       Congress created the Competitiveness Policy Council and \n     charged it with reporting yearly on a series of actions that \n     the nation could take to enhance its competitiveness in \n     transportation, technology, trade, fiscal policy and \n     education.\n       The White House created a Competitiveness Council, chaired \n     by the Vice President. So, this topic was a concern at every \n     level of government.\n       At the 1989 Education Summit's opening press conference, I \n     noted that: ``We increasingly cannot compete with overseas \n     nations. . . . The problem is that successful state and local \n     programs are not enough; we need national educational \n     excellence, and a national commitment to obtain it.''\n       So, the competitiveness issue permeated the political \n     landscape, it impacted everything else. There was consensus \n     across the land that we had a ``competitiveness problem'' And \n     education was a part of that problem--and solution.\n       What did this mean?\n       It meant that education could no longer be strictly a local \n     or state issue. For if we had a national problem of \n     competitiveness, then we needed national solutions. We could \n     not leave it to chance that every State and locality would \n     properly educate their young people; after all, our \n     competitors had not. We needed a national conversation about \n     education, we needed national results. We needed--voila--\n     national goals, just like our competitors had. That's why the \n     Joint Statement issued by the President and Governors at the \n     conclusion of the Summit began with these words: ``The \n     President and the nation's Governors agree that a better \n     educated citizenry is the key to the continued growth and \n     prosperity of the United States. . . . Education has always \n     been important, but never this important because the stakes \n     have changed: Our competitors for opportunity are also \n     working to educate their people. As they continue to improve, \n     they make the future a moving target.''\n       And in the introduction to the National Education Goals \n     agreed to five months later by the President and the \n     Governors, you will find these words: ``America's educational \n     performance must be second to none in the 21st century. \n     Education is central to our quality of life. It is at the \n     heart of our economic strength and security, our creativity \n     in the arts and letters, our invention in the sciences, and \n     the perpetuation of our cultural values. Education is the key \n     to America's international competitiveness.''\n       The need to fit education into a national competitiveness \n     strategy, combined with the political conclusions arrived at \n     by Governors of both parties and the White House, forced a \n     focus on national goals as the way forward.\n\n\n                              federal role\n\n       Finally, let me focus on my third point: the concern in \n     1989 over Federal involvement in education.\n       If the political mood and economic imperative seemed to be \n     converging on the idea of national education goals, there was \n     still an unease many people felt about Federal involvement in \n     education. This had been the subject of considerable debate a \n     decade earlier when the U.S. Department of Education was \n     created during the Carter Administration. It was the topic of \n     campaign rhetoric on the campaign trail in 1980, and it was \n     certainly argued in the halls of Congress on an annual basis \n     in the early to mid-1980's when President Reagan proposed \n     eliminating the department in his proposed budgets.\n       Among those most uncomfortable with the idea of an \n     Education Summit were those who were ideologically opposed to \n     the very idea of Federal involvement in education. Many \n     writers, including William Safire, warned explicitly that the \n     Bush Administration was setting the stage for a large \n     expansion of the Federal role in education and for \n     nationalizing the issue.\n       They were right.\n       In fact, I would argue that the major achievement of the \n     1989 Education Summit was to settle, once and for all, the \n     argument over a Federal role in education; whether education \n     would be a national issue. The\n\n[[Page S11453]]\n\n     President and the Governors, by agreeing to the need for \n     national education goals and agreeing on a strategy for \n     developing those goals, had agreed upon a framework. There \n     WOULD be a Federal role; education WOULD be a national issue, \n     addressed with national solutions.\n       It meant that educational decisions would no longer be \n     settled solely at the local level. It meant that legislative \n     deliberations at the State and Federal levels would become \n     relatively less important, and executive decision and vision \n     relatively more important. That's what happens when results \n     are required; when speeches, money and programs are just not \n     enough.\n       This all seems like conventional wisdom today, but we can \n     easily forget it was not always so. The 1989 Summit had a \n     real impact, far beyond the imagining of those of us \n     privileged enough to have participated. It fundamentally \n     changed the balance of political power on education issues, \n     and it nationalized education policy in a way few would have \n     conceived just a few years earlier.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n       When the President called for a Summit with the Nation's \n     Governors to discuss education, many observers may not have \n     known what to expect. I don't recall any of the Governors \n     believing beforehand that, while we agreed on the need for \n     national goals, we would settle the argument over Federal \n     involvement in education, or that we would shift the Federal \n     focus on education from one end of Pennsylvania Avenue to the \n     other.\n       I do recall a great deal of skepticism and criticism from \n     outside observers, especially Congress and the press. But I \n     do not recall anything but the most constructive attitude \n     being expressed by any of the principal participants. And, by \n     the way, this was a meeting of principals, very few staff \n     aides were permitted much of a role at all.\n       It is worth noting, by the way, that the participants--\n     despite all of the good will and convergence of thinking on \n     the value of setting national goals--did not settle on \n     specific goals at the Summit. We agreed on the need for \n     goals, and, in general, what those goals should address. The \n     actual goals themselves, however, were not developed until \n     several months later.\n       But, for the first time, the President and Governors were \n     discussing on a national level a series of important \n     questions. Many of these had long been discussed and debated \n     in the States, and particularly in the Southern Regional \n     Education Board states. These questions included, among \n     others:\n       Intervention: Could we do a better job of preparing \n     children for first grade?\n       Dropout rates: Could we slow the tide?\n       Adult literacy: Could we put a dent in it, even eliminate \n     it?\n       Teacher quality: Could we motivate and inspire it?\n       Decentralized management: Could it produce better results?\n       And, parental choice: Could this be a workable technique or \n     just the latest fad?\n       In the end, it was a focus on such questions that formed \n     the basis of the goals and the national education policy that \n     we know today.\n       I believe the Education Summit was, to paraphrase Winston \n     Churchill, the ``beginning of a new beginning'' in education \n     policy. I believe the way we think, as a Nation, about the \n     goals and objectives of education began to change in \n     September, 1989. Unsurprisingly, we did not find all the \n     answers at the Summit. But we were asking the right \n     questions--and for the first time, we were asking them as a \n     Nation.\n       In one sense, this should not have been all that \n     surprising, because throughout our national history, \n     educational reform has been a vital and characteristic part \n     of the American impulse. We have always believed that we can, \n     by the force of our own imagination and determination, \n     improve tomorrow by improving ourselves and our children.\n       But, never has it been more important that our traditional \n     convictions give rise to deliberate action.\n       If ignorance is the enemy of democracy, in an international \n     economy, ignorance could well be an invitation to national \n     decline. In 1989, it was clear and apparent that the time had \n     arrived for us to put ourselves on the spot, That was the \n     message I heard in Charlottesville,\n       Accountability and the measurement of student performance, \n     we declared, must be an integral part of our educational \n     process. Indeed, Charlottesville portended a significant \n     shift in our approach to education: From here on, we said \n     that we are going to be increasingly measured by more than \n     the resources we invest. Instead, we declared that we are \n     going to be questioned and examined on the progress our \n     students achieve--or fail to achieve.\n       Frankly, I think that is how it should be--for there is too \n     much at stake for it to be otherwise.\n       In 1989, the President and the governors joined efforts to \n     ensure that America becomes a Nation resolved to using \n     education as the best means for shaping the future. The \n     reason we are here today is to assess our national \n     performance since 1989. Where are the benchmarks of progress? \n     Where are the guideposts for confronting the challenges?\n       Our speakers and panelists today are here to help us make \n     those assessments. I share your interest in their opinions of \n     how far we have come, and I am confident that they will focus \n     our attention on the significant challenges at hand.\n       Today, as in 1989, we recognize that we have a lot of work \n     to do, and we should always keep in perspective that all of \n     our educational goals, commitments and resources come down to \n     two fundamental points:\n       First, education's role as a transmitter of civilization's \n     knowledge and values must not be diminished. It is part of \n     the glue that binds together the fabric of our society.\n       Second, education is, also, increasingly, the engine that \n     drives the American economy--our economic future depends upon \n     our ability to compete, but our ability to compete depends \n     upon our ability to educate. It is just that simple.\n       Thank you. I look forward to the rest of the Conference.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded and I be recognized to speak in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/18/senate-section/article/S11453-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11453-S11454]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTES TO RETIRING SENATORS\n\n\n                              Tom Daschle\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, it is with great sadness that I rise to \nbid official farewell to one of my best friends and to one of the \ngreatest Senators ever to grace this body, Tom Daschle of South Dakota.\n  Unsurprisingly, I am sure I have known Tom longer than anyone here. I \nvividly remember his first campaign for Congress in 1978, the same year \nI ran for the South Dakota House of Representatives for the first time. \nWe were two young candidates, almost the same age, recent graduates, \nthe same year, of South Dakota colleges. While we were running for very \ndifferent offices, I felt an immediate bond with him at that time.\n  Tom's first race for Congress was in many ways predictive of the \ncareer that would follow. He was then, and still is, the hardest \nworking, most focused person I have ever met in any sphere of my life. \nThat year he knocked on more than 40,000 doors, personally asking South \nDakotans for their vote. I can tell you, knocking on 40,000 doors in \nthe middle of a South Dakota winter is a real challenge.\n  Tom looked so young he was once mistaken as the paperboy at one of \nthose doors--a woman asked how much money she owed him. I have a photo \nI cherish to this day of Tom and me together during that first \ncampaign, both of us looking like we were 14 years old. It makes you \nwonder how anyone voted for either of us at that time.\n  I remember watching the election returns coming in for Tom's campaign \nthat evening and it didn't look very good, frankly. In fact, when I \nwent to bed that night I was almost certain he had lost. It was only \nwhen I woke up that I found Tom was only behind by 50 votes with a \nrecount certain, and as it turned out, he was certified the winner \nofficially by 14 votes out of 130,000 votes cast. Who would have \ndreamed that such a close victory in South Dakota would have been the \nbeginning of such a distinguished career?\n\n  In the intervening years, I watched with admiration while Tom's \ncareer advanced in the House of Representatives. He was a natural \nleader, and I do not believe that many who knew him were surprised, in \n1986, when he decided to run for the Senate, taking on the same man \nwho, 6 years previously, defeated Senator George McGovern, an \ninstitution in our State.\n  It was far from an easy race, but Tom prevailed in the end, and his \nleaving his House seat opened it for my election that year as well. It \nwas the culmination of those two elections which led to an extremely \nclose working relationship but also to a very close friendship.\n  I have spent the last 18 years working side by side with Tom Daschle. \nI cannot imagine a better partner with whom to work. He is, as I \nmentioned earlier, the hardest working person I have ever known. He is \nalso the most patient person I have ever known, as well as unfailingly \ngenerous--qualities that served him very well as Senate Democratic \nleader, an extremely demanding job.\n  There have been fewer than 2,000 Senators who have served our Nation \nin\n\n[[Page S11454]]\n\nthis body, but there never has been one who cared as much or worked as \nhard for his home State as Tom Daschle. I can list his many and varied \naccomplishments but I would be here for hours and that would not serve \nthe purpose of this farewell. It was the Greek philosopher Plato who \nsaid, ``The measure of a man is what he does with power.'' And it is \nthat test that so clearly shows the character and the humanity and the \nvalues of Tom Daschle. Tom never used the power that he had attained \nfor self-aggrandizement. He used it to build a better South Dakota, and \na stronger America.\n  He has always realized that our country works best when people have \nan opportunity to live up to their own potential, when our children are \nnot shackled by poverty and lack of education, when our people who need \na helping hand are given one, and when our older Americans are able to \nlive out the balance of their lives with dignity. The truth is, if it \nweren't for Tom Daschle and his untiring work, there are children who \nwould not be educated and families who would not be housed and \nvulnerable people who would be uncared for.\n  Tom Daschle's priorities and values have been the priorities and \nvalues of his strong family and his devout faith.\n  It was Jesus Christ who said:\n\n       Inasmuch as ye have done unto one of the least of these, my \n     brethren, ye have done it unto Me.\n\n  And no matter what level of accomplishment and power Tom Daschle \nattained, he never forgot the ``least of the people'' who Christ \nreferenced.\n  While we will no longer have Tom Daschle to lead us in this body, we \nare both instructed and warmed by the example he gave us during his 26 \nyears in his congressional career. He and his wife Linda have made an \nextraordinary team and will always be among the closest of friends to \nmy wife Barbara and me. I will never serve with a man I admire more \nthan Tom Daschle, and it is with very great sadness that I say goodbye \nto his presence in this body. But more than anyone I have ever served \nwith, or ever will serve with, he has given glory and meaning to the \nterm ``United States Senator.''\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/18/senate-section/article/S11454-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11454]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          COUNTRY-OF-ORIGIN LABELING FOR MEATS AND VEGETABLES\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, in recent days there have been news \nreports about our colleagues on the other side of the Capitol Building \ndeciding that they would like to get rid of something called country-\nof-origin labeling for meats and vegetables. This is a law that has \nbeen previously enacted by the Congress saying that consumers have a \nright to know where their meat and vegetables come from. So a Member of \nthe House and the Speaker of the House and the majority leader of the \nHouse have indicated they would like to find a way, in these waning \ndays, perhaps in the Omnibus appropriations bill, to repeal the \nrequirement to establish country-of-origin labeling for meat and \nvegetables.\n  Country-of-origin labeling is now the law of the land. The Secretary \nof Agriculture has been dragging her feet for some long while in \nimplementing it. While she was dragging her feet, the Congress decided \nto extend the time for implementation, so that time was extended over \nthe objection of many of us. My colleagues, Senator Daschle, Senator \nJohnson, and many others here in the Chamber objected to that. But, \nnonetheless, it was done last year in one of these omnibus bills.\n  If those who are making decisions about what to put in omnibus bills \nthese days decide they want to repeal the country-of-origin labeling \nlaw in an omnibus bill this year, they will do a great disservice to \nAmerican consumers. They will pull the rug out from under farmers and \nranchers in our country. Why? Because the fact is, we produce the \nhighest quality food in the world.\n  Consumers want to know where their food comes from. Almost any \nconsumer in this country can take a look at his or her T-shirt or their \nshoes, and on the label it will say: Made in the U.S.A. Made in China. \nYou will find out exactly where it was made. We know where shirts come \nfrom, and we know where shoes come from because it is all labeled. But \nmeat is not labeled. The law requires it to be, but it is not at this \npoint. So the question is, Will this law remain, and will it, in fact, \nbe implemented, or will it not?\n  We had a U.S. Department of Agriculture report about the condition of \nmeat that has been imported into this country. And I would like to just \nshow a couple of comments from that report. The report was talking \nabout conditions inside a meatpacking plant in Hermosillo, Mexico. That \nplant in Mexico supplied raw beef to the American consumers. It had \nnever been inspected and was finally inspected once. Here is what they \nfound. They found:\n\n       ``Shanks and briskets were contaminated with feces.''\n\n  A U.S. Department of Agriculture official wrote of his tour of the \nplant:\n\n       ``In the refrigerator a disease-condemned carcass was \n     observed ready for boning and distribution in commerce . . . \n     Paint and condensation from dirty surfaces were dripping on \n     the meat.''\n\n  The official found that workers were literally walking on the beef \nthat was going to be approved for export to the United States. They \nfound that a side of beef approved for processing was infected with \nbacterial blood infection.\n  The problem is not limited to the Mexican plants. This is one plant \nin Mexico. Incidentally, this plant was shut down, then reopened under \nanother name, and to my knowledge has never again been inspected.\n  Mr. President, by unanimous consent let me ask to show this piece of \nbeef from a supermarket.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, no one knows where this comes from. No \nMember of the Senate will know where this originated. Did this come \nfrom the Mexican plant I just described? Does it come from a French \nplant that was also inspected and contaminated? Does this come from one \nof those plants, or does it come from a domestic source in this country \nin which inspection, we know, is rigorous? Does it come from a domestic \nsource where we have farmers and ranchers who produce the best supply \nof meat available in the world? Where does this piece of beef \noriginate? No one knows. Consumers deserve to know. They have a right \nto know.\n\n  The country-of-origin labeling requirement passed by the Congress \nwill give them the opportunity to know, but some of our colleagues \naround here, hailing the call of the big packing plants and others, \ndecide now they want to try to repeal that. Maybe, just once, this \nplace can stand up on the side of farmers and ranchers and consumers, \njust once, and ignore the call of the bigger economic interests who \nsay: Let's not do this. We clearly should do this.\n  Labeling is important. Labeling empowers consumers. Labeling protects \nAmerican producers who are producing the best quality food at the \nlowest disposable income of any country in the world. So my message to \nthose who are now sauntering around the Chambers watching this Omnibus \nappropriations bill be put together is this: It would be a very foolish \nmistake to believe that the Omnibus appropriations bill should, without \nany debate, carry a provision that would repeal something Congress has \nalready done that will give people the right to understand where their \nmeat and vegetables come from, where the origination point is for the \nvegetables and the meat that is being consumed by the American people.\n  If, in fact, the majority party decides to do this--as I indicated, \none Member of the U.S. House especially is proposing it. It has been, \nit is reported, supported by the Speaker of the House and the majority \nleader of the House. If they move in this direction, it will be a very \nserious mistake, in my judgment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/18/senate-section/article/S11454-2", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11454-S11456]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      INTERNATIONAL TRADE DEFICITS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I would like to, on another subject, speak \nfor just a moment about the area of international trade.\n\n[[Page S11455]]\n\n  Yesterday, the Senate approved an increase in the debt ceiling by \n$800 billion. That is the fiscal policy debt, that is the amount of \nmoney that is spent over that which is collected in revenues. That \nmeans our kids and grandkids assume this responsibility. It is Federal \ndebt.\n  The budget deficit is the highest in history. This is a completely, \nthoroughly irresponsible fiscal policy. There is no question about it. \nOh, I know people say we have had economic slowdowns or recessions or \nwars or terrorism and this and that and the other thing.\n  Look, we have had that for a century. But we have never had the size \nof the deficits we have now had in times like this. As far as I know, \nwe have never before decided to fight a war with borrowed money and ask \ngenerations that come after us to pay for it.\n  But I want to talk about another debt that is growing, and it is \nlarger than the fiscal policy indebtedness that we have. And that is \nthe foreign debt, which arises from trade deficits. This chart goes \nback to 1998. I could go further. It shows that we have the largest \ntrade deficits in history, by far. Last month, it was $54.1 billion, \nthe third highest in history. You can see where it is going. It is \ngrowing and growing and growing.\n  Last month alone, the trade deficit with China--just one country--was \n$15 billion. Now, nobody talks about this. Nobody seems to give a rip. \nSome people apparently think this will have no consequence for this \ncountry or its long-term prognosis. But they are wrong. This trade \ndeficit is dangerous and will be debilitating to the country's economy \nunless we do something about it.\n  Month after month after month we see these reports. And on this \nchart, this red ink has everything to do with jobs, which define the \nquality of life in this country. There is no social program in this \ncountry that is as important as a good job that pays well, that gives \nsomeone an opportunity to go to work, have some security, have \nbenefits, and take care of their family and have a good life. The \nexpansion of jobs and opportunity in this country will determine what \nkind of a country we have, what kind of opportunity exists for our kids \nand our grandkids. And jobs are leaving the country.\n\n  Yesterday, I had a call from some American workers. I will not \ndescribe the company. They are workers for a company that produces a \ngreat product. They want to sell that product in China.\n  Now China has a $15 billion monthly surplus with us this past month. \nThey ship us their shirts, their shoes, their trousers, their trinkets. \nThey ship it all to us, and we buy it. But can we get our products into \nChina?\n  These workers say they've been told that to have their product be \nsold in China, it has to have a 40- to 50-percent Chinese content, \notherwise you cannot get it in. So, therefore, the workers are \nconcerned that the company is now going to begin processing operations \nin China. Why? Because China insists on it.\n  Well, look, that violates the World Trade Organization.\n  That does not come as a shock, of course. There is a systematic \nviolation all the time, by these countries that decide they want to \nship all of their products to the United States, but they want to keep \ntheir markets closed to us. That means our good jobs are leaving, not \ncoming.\n  There are a lot of reasons for it, one of which is we have had \nincompetent trade negotiators under Republican and Democratic \nadministrations, completely incompetent. They think their job is to \nnegotiate agreements, the more the better, and they don't care what's \nin them. If they don't get an agreement, they think they fail. So they \nnegotiate an agreement, and give away the store.\n  We just negotiated a bilateral trade agreement with China. Do you \nknow what our negotiators agreed to? On automobile trade, they agreed \nto this: After a phase-in, China can impose a 25-percent tariff on U.S. \nautomobiles sold in China, and we will impose a 2.5-percent tariff on \nany Chinese vehicles sold in the United States. Let me say that again. \nOur negotiators agreed with China that we would allow them to impose a \ntariff 10 times higher than the tariff we would impose on them in \nreciprocal automobile trade.\n  Now, what on earth would possess negotiations to result in that, with \na country with whom we have a very large trade deficit?\n  We know China is ramping up an automobile industry and an export \nautomobile industry, and we now have a trade agreement with them where \nour negotiators said it is all right to have an imbalance that is \ntenfold in reciprocal automobile trade.\n  What does that mean? To strip all the varnish from it, it means it is \nall right with our negotiators for American jobs to be obliterated and \nChinese jobs created on automobile trade. That might be all right with \nsome unnamed trade negotiator, but it is not all right with me. Whoever \nnegotiated that was fundamentally incompetent.\n  We have some companies these days that are not American companies. \nOh, they are American in terms of charter. They get a charter, a \ncorporate charter, that allows them to become an artificial person, be \nable to sue and be sued, and to contract and be contracted with. They \nhave all the rights of people, except they don't die. They can go \nbroke, but they will never die. These artificial people are responsible \nonly to their shareholders.\n  These companies have decided they would like to have all the benefits \nof doing business in the United States as American companies, and all \nthe protection that exists from that, except they don't want to have \nthe obligation of paying taxes in the United States. Therefore, they do \nbusiness through a mailbox in a tax haven country. They can set up a \nbusiness in the Grand Cayman Islands or the Bahamas. In some extreme \ncases, they have even decided they want to renounce their American \ncitizenship to avoid paying their tax obligation to the United States, \nin what is known as an inversion.\n  In addition to that, we now have company after company--and all you \nhave to do is open up the Wall Street Journal every day to see it--\ndoing something called outsourcing. That means taking American jobs and \nmoving them somewhere else in the world, where it is cheaper. Instead \nof doing business in America, paying American workers $10, $15 an hour, \nthey can perhaps do it in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Indonesia, or China. I \nhave described at length on the floor of the Senate the fact that Huffy \nBicycles decided to do that, and the little red wagons, Radio Flyer \nwagons--that firm was in America for 100 years. They decided to move \nproduction elsewhere. Why? Because they can pay sub-minimum wages. \nHuffy Bicycles used to pay $11 an hour to American workers. They got \nfired because they were too expensive. You can make them for 30 cents \nan hour in China, and you can work those people 7 days a week and 12 \nhours a day.\n  So we have what is called outsourcing. American companies are \noutsourcing jobs. That is a fancy term that describes the firing of \nAmerican workers, in most cases, and employing overseas workers to do \nthe same job at a fraction of the price.\n\n  What's even more nuts is that our tax code provides incentives for \noutsourcing. That's right, when a company wants to outsource, when a \ncompany wants to shut down their plant in South Carolina or in Ohio, \nand do that production in China, we say to that company: We have a \ntreat for you. Get rid of your American workers, shut down the plant, \nmove the whole thing to China and you can get a special tax break.\n  I happen to think that is absolutely nuts. What kind of a country \nprovides a tax incentive for its companies to get rid of American \nworkers and employ foreign workers? What kind of a country's tax system \ndoes that? This country's tax system does it. Yes, we voted on that. I \noffered an amendment to close that insidious loophole, that perversion \nin the Tax Code. Guess what. I lost in the Senate.\n  Here's something else. In a recent bill, the Senate Finance \nCommittee, in conference, decided that U.S. companies who have foreign \ncontrolled subsidiaries and have not repatriated their overseas \nearnings to the United States will be able to repatriate that income at \na tax rate of only 5.25 percent. Well, I have a lot of constituents who \nwould love to have that tax rate. Wouldn't that be a wonderful thing? \nIf it is good enough for the biggest companies, which outsourced jobs, \nit ought to be good enough for all Americans.\n\n[[Page S11456]]\n\n  Ma Ferguson was Governor of Texas once and was involved in a debate \nabout the English-only language back in the 1930s. She had a press \nconference and held up a Bible and she said, ``If English was good \nenough for Jesus, it is good enough for Texas.'' It is the good-enough \ntheory, I guess. The 5.25-percent tax rate is good enough for \ncorporations that moved American jobs overseas. Why is a 5.25-percent \ntax rate not good enough for people named Johnson and Olsen? Why is \n5.25 percent not good enough for everybody?\n  Why is it that this Congress, when it looks at these issues, won't \neven take a baby step in the right direction? We are hemorrhaging good \njobs in this country. This is a race to the bottom. We fought for a \ncentury about important things. We fought for a century about the right \nof workers to organize. It is a very important right in America. It was \na similar fight that lit the fuse that caused freedom all over Eastern \nEurope. Lech Walesa led that fight, the right to organize. People died \nin the streets on that issue--the right to say that we are not going to \nhave 12-year-old kids working down in a mine, or in a factory. Child \nlabor laws, safe workplace laws--a whole range of issues. We fought for \na century to create safe workplaces, child labor laws, minimum wages, \nthe right to organize, all of these issues, which have, in my judgment, \nmade this a better place.\n  The fact is, there are American companies now that simply pole-vault \nover the issues and say we don't have to worry about that, about hiring \nkids. We can hire kids, we can hire 12-year-olds, work them 12 hours a \nday, pay 12 cents an hour, and we don't have to worry. How do we do \nthat? We hire them overseas, hire them elsewhere. That means those who \nhave to compete in this new world order have to compete with countries \nthat have decided they are going to make it illegal for workers to \norganize. You have to compete with 12-year-old kids who are paid 12 \ncents an hour.\n  If you wonder whether that is happening, I can show you stories. \nThere is one about a woman named Sadisha, who is making tennis shoes \nfor 16 cents an hour. This is an hour and a half of labor in a pair of \ntennis shoes that comes to our store shelves for $80 a pair, and \nSadisha's pay is 24 cents for making the tennis shoes.\n  You think that doesn't happen? It does. I can tell you stories about \nthe kids in India who were making carpets, who came to this country and \ntestified before the Congress about the conditions in which they \nworked. The people they worked for took gunpowder and lit the gunpower \non the children's fingertips to create scarring, so these little kids \ncould be employed to sew these carpets. And the carpets were sent to \nour store shelves so we could buy them, and congratulate ourselves on \nthe low prices.\n  Is there an admission price to the American marketplace? Is there? \nAre there some basic set of standards, or is this a race to the bottom \nto have us compete with that sort of situation?\n  I held a hearing not too long ago with some young women from Honduras \nworking in a sweatshop making designer shirts, for a very prominent \nAmerican label. They were working under incredibly abusive conditions. \nThe story is the same all over.\n  People talk about this being free trade. Look, this is simply a sea \nof red ink, a trade deficit that is weakening this country, and we have \nnot paid any attention to the rules of trade that would begin to stop \nthis. We had better wake up and decide that our interest is to be \nprotective--and, yes, I use that word even though it is a pejorative \nword these days--protective of the economic interests of this country. \nWe must do that.\n  I spoke of Lech Walesa. Let me describe his speech to a joint meeting \nof the Congress, one of the most remarkable moments I recall in my \nservice here.\n  He told us about a Saturday morning in a shipyard in Gdansk, Poland, \nwhen, having been fired as an electrician in that shipyard, this \nunemployed electrician was leading a strike against the Communist \ngovernment demanding rights for the labor movement in Poland.\n  He said they grabbed him that Saturday morning and began to beat him. \nThe Communist secret police grabbed him and beat him severely and threw \nhim over the barbed wire fence at the edge of the shipyard. He laid \nthere, having been beaten severely, face down, bleeding in the dirt. He \nsaid he wondered while laying there, this unemployed electrician having \nbeen beaten severely, what to do next. Well, he picked himself up, and \nclimbed right back over the barbed wire fence, right back into the same \nshipyard, to continue the fight. Ten years later this unemployed \nelectrician was announced at the door of the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives as the President of his country, the President of \nPoland.\n  This was not an intellectual, not a scholar, not a diplomat, not a \nsoldier, but an unemployed electrician with uncommon courage. He said \nthis to us: We didn't have any guns. The Communists had all the guns. \nWe didn't have any bullets. The Communists had all the bullets. We were \narmed only with an idea, a powerful idea: People ought to be free to \nchoose their own destiny. And then he said: Ideas are more powerful \nthan guns.\n  There was a lot of applause that day, and appropriately so--applause \nof courage, the progress towards freedom and labor rights in Poland. \nBut around here, we seem to have short memories. We are trading away \nour hard-won rights.\n  The first baby step we should have taken in this Congress we decided \nnot to take. I offered an amendment, and it was defeated, to stop the \nperverse and insidious tax breaks that incentivize American jobs going \noverseas. Let's not reward companies that move our jobs overseas. Stop \nit; stop it now. It is a baby step to decide to shut down that tax \nincentive.\n  We did not get it done this time. I lost that vote. But I am \nrelentless, and I will again be on this floor the minute we return in \nJanuary demanding once again an opportunity to debate and to vote on \nthis issue. This is about American jobs. It is about hope and \nopportunity in this country. It is about expanding this great American \nexperiment, and this issue, I assure you, will not go away.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to make a couple of comments \nregarding the departure of one of our colleagues, Senator Zell Miller. \nI have had the pleasure of working with Senator Miller for the last \nseveral years and I think the world of him. He comes from a great line \nof fantastic Senators from the great State of Georgia.\n  When I was first elected, I served with Senator Sam Nunn and Senator \nMack Mattingly. Both were very good friends. Both were outstanding \nSenators. Senator Paul Coverdell, a very good, close friend of mine, \nserved in the Senate for a little over a term and, unfortunately, had a \nvery sudden illness and passed away. Zell Miller was appointed to take \nhis place.\n  I remember thinking at the time that Paul Coverdell was a great loss \nto the Senate. I believe that today. He had a great future in the \nSenate. He was actually elected to the Senate leadership, which was \nvery unusual for his first term in the Senate. Paul Coverdell was one \nof my closest friends. I really did mourn his loss.\n  I did not know his replacement appointed at that time, Zell Miller, \nbut I got to know him very quickly. I grew to know him, respect him, \nand admire him as a patriot and as a Senator. He did a fantastic job in \nservice not only to his state of Georgia but, frankly, to this country. \nHe made a valued, positive, and considerable impact on the Senate and, \nfrankly, on our country. I will talk about that for a second.\n  I remember he was a real leader in passing the Homeland Security \nlegislation. That was very tough legislation. It passed by a very \nnarrow margin. We did that in his first year in the Senate.\n  He supported efforts to enact tax reform. I was chairman of the \nCommittee on the Budget in 2003, and we passed a budget, frankly, by \none vote. Zell Miller's vote helped make it happen. We had about 80 \nsomething amendments to the budget during consideration of the budget \nprocess. Zell Miller was with me on every one. He cosponsored the \nbudget. He was my principal cosponsor of that budget.\n\n[[Page S11457]]\n\n  That budget enabled us to pass the tax relief we did later that year, \nthe economic tax reform bill of 2003. That bill made a lot of changes, \nI might add, a lot of positive changes, that would not have passed had \nit not been for Zell Miller. He cosponsored that bill with me. I was \nhonored the President asked me to sponsor it, and I was honored to ask \nZell Miller if he would cosponsor it with me, and he did.\n  We defeated a lot of amendments designed to gut the legislation, and \nwe passed the budget. Again, we passed it with the Vice President \nbreaking the tie. It would not have passed without Zell Miller's \nleadership, without his sponsoring the legislation.\n  What did that legislation do? It made a difference on every American \ntaxpayer in this country. That legislation allowed us to have a $1,000 \ntax credit per child. That legislation allowed us to expand and provide \nmarriage penalty relief. For a couple making $58,000, marriage penalty \nrelief boiled down to about $905. That passed because Zell Miller stood \nwith us on that legislation.\n  It also allowed us to reduce the capital gains tax rate from 20 \npercent to 15 percent. It allowed us to say that we would not double \ntax corporate dividends, at least not as punitively as we did before. \nWe reduced the corporate tax on dividends. Actually, the bill we passed \nin the Senate had zero double taxation. The bill that came out of \nconference was 15 percent, instead of the ordinary rates. That is a big \nand positive change because this country, unfortunately, taxed \ndistributions from corporations higher than any other country. We are \ntied with Japan at a net effective tax rate of 70 percent.\n  Why would corporations distribute earnings to their owners if the \nGovernment would get 70 percent? Many did not. They would accumulate \nearnings, hide the money, or do something different with them. We \npassed that legislation, and now people are paying dividends.\n  Microsoft announced a multibillion-dollar distribution because of \nthat legislation. We tax it now at the individual rate, 15 percent. \nWhen we started marking up that legislation, the Dow Jones was at \n7,700. Today it is over 10,500. That legislation made a difference. \nThat legislation passed because Zell Miller stood with us on the floor \nto pass that legislation.\n  It is not too often you can actually say you passed legislation that \nmade a real and positive impact. There are over two million jobs that \nhave been created in the last 14 months as a result of that \nlegislation. I believe the President signed it in June of 2003. It has \nbeen almost a year and a half now, and a couple of million jobs have \nbeen created since we passed that legislation. The economy is moving. \nRevenues are coming into the Government. The deficit is $100 billion \nless than estimated previously, 9 months ago, because, there is \neconomic revival. We do have new jobs being created. There are positive \nsigns. A lot of that happened because of the courage and conviction of \nthe Senator from Georgia.\n  I said Paul Coverdell was my friend. He has certainly been missed in \nthis Senate, and that is a fact. I will also say that Zell Miller is my \nvery dear friend and he will be missed in the Senate. He only served \nfor a few years in the Senate, but he had a great impact, a very \npositive impact, not only on taxpayers, and the country but to our body \npolitic, the body of the country. As a patriot, a former marine, former \nmayor, former State senator, former Lieutenant Governor, and as a \nformer Governor, he had enormous impact.\n  He was a speaker at the Republican National Convention. I told him \nhis speech wasn't so much that of a Democrat or Republican; his speech \nwas that of a patriot who was speaking out strong because he believed \nstrongly in this country. You could see it. You could sense it. You \ncould believe it.\n  I am very proud to have Zell Miller as my friend. He and his wife \nShirley have been a blessing to this body and a blessing to this \ncountry. I thank God for the fact I had the opportunity to serve with \nhim and the fact that he served in this body. I think our country is \nmuch better for it, and I wish him every good wish in the years ahead.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Ben Nighthorse Campbell\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I wish to make a couple of comments \nregarding my very good friend, Ben Nighthorse Campbell, who is retiring \nwith me at the end of this session. Senator Campbell is a unique \nSenator. All Senators are unique, but he is especially unique. He is a \nvery special Senator, the only Native American presently serving in the \nSenate and he is chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee.\n  He has a very distinguished career. He was in the Air Force. He \nserved in Korea. He served in the State legislature. He served in the \nHouse of Representatives. I believe he was elected in 1986. He was \nelected to the Senate as a Democrat in 1992, 12 years ago. He was \nreelected in 1998. In March of 1995, he had the courage and the \nconviction to change parties. That is not easily done. He did it and I \ngreatly respect him and admire him for that, but also for his service \nto our country.\n  He is a jewelry designer.\n  I have had the pleasure of knowing Ben Nighthorse Campbell and his \nwife, Linda, fairly well for the last 12 years. I have great respect \nfor him. He has passed a lot of legislation. A lot of people are not \naware of that. Many of his bills have become law. In many cases, he is \na quiet legislator. He is effective and he gets things done.\n  He is on the Appropriations Committee. He has had his fingerprints on \na lot of legislation. He is chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee. \nThat committee considers a multitude of issues. Some of us kind of \nmoved around and made way for him to become chairman of that committee. \nWe thought it was very special to have a Native American become \nchairman of the Indian Affairs Committee for the first time.\n  He is unique from the standpoint that he rides a Harley. He has a \ngreat love for the West.\n  I think he has made a valuable, important contribution to this body, \nthe Senate.\n  He has represented his State of Colorado very well. Colorado has had \nsome great Senators. Bill Armstrong was one of my favorite Senators and \none of my mentors. Wayne Allard is another outstanding Senator from \nColorado. Ben Nighthorse Campbell certainly falls in that role of being \nan outstanding Senator. I think he and Linda both will be missed in \nthis body, the Senate.\n  I congratulate him and Linda for their many years of service going \nall the way back to the military, to the State legislature, to serving \nin the House of Representatives, and now 12 years in the Senate. He has \ngiven a lot of public service to this country, and given it well. He \nhas served well. As the Bible says, ``Well done thou good and faithful \nservant''. He has certainly done that. He has made the State of \nColorado very proud and, frankly, the country very proud. The Senate is \nbetter off for his service. I congratulate him for his service.\n  The Senate will miss the services and the laughter of Ben Nighthorse \nCampbell. I compliment him for his service.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

HARRY FRITZ\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a distinguished man \nand educator, Montana's 2004 Professor of the Year award winner, Dr. \nHarry Fritz.\n  Harry was born in the State of Maryland, but he graduated from \nMissoula County High School in Montana in 1956. He attended Dartmouth \nCollege to earn his bachelor of arts degree. Harry's relationship with \nthe University of Montana, located in Missoula, began when he attended \nthe university to get his master of arts degree.\n\n[[Page S11458]]\n\n  After earning his Ph.D. from Washington University in St. Louis, \nHarry returned to the University of Montana, and that is where he has \nhung his hat ever since.\n  Harry is the chairman of the Department of History and a full-time \nprofessor at the University of Montana. He exemplifies the type of \nprofessor Montana has come to expect from its higher education \ncommunity. He is a first-rate guy. He is just aces. He is an educator \nwho meets the highest standards of professional excellence. And he is a \nstudent's teacher. He connects with students and draws them into our \nNation's history.\n  I might say, I first met and knew Harry Fritz back about 1972, \nsomewhere in there, when I was practicing law in Missoula, MT, and was \nrunning for the State legislature. Professor Fritz and a couple friends \nof ours would get together about every couple, three weeks and have \npizza and beer. We called ourselves the ``Beer Committee,'' and Harry \nwas head of the Beer Committee. It was a super bunch of friends. We \nwould talk about the world's problems and service and what needed to be \ndone for Montana and the Nation. It was, in many respects, the \nenthusiasm and knowledge of Harry Fritz that got me interested in \npublic service. He is that kind of a guy.\n  I might also say, he has a wonderful sense of humor. He is a tall \nman. He looks a lot like Abe Lincoln. When he puts on his beard, he \nportrays Abraham Lincoln and performs little skits. As a history \nprofessor, he is able to bring President Lincoln and lots of other \naspects surrounding President Lincoln into his classes at the \nUniversity of Montana.\n  I might say, too, his classes are always the first to be fully \nsubscribed. People want to go to Professor Fritz's history classes \nbecause he connects so much, he brings history to life so much, with a \nsense of humor, with compassion, and with insight and perception. It is \nno wonder he has been named Professor of the Year for 2004.\n  Many of us who know Harry also are reminded of all the ways he has \nserved. He not only is a history professor, a terrific professor at \nthat, but he also served in the State legislature in Montana in the \nMontana Senate and the Montana House. He wants to do what he can to \nserve the people of our State. His wife Nancy is equally active, \nequally dedicated to service. Nancy, too, was a representative in the \nMontana State legislature at one time. So they are people who exemplify \nthe best of human nature; that is, serving people.\n  I have a view that the most noble human endeavor is service. It is \nservice to community, it is service to church, it is service to \nfriends, service in whatever way makes the most sense for each one of \nus. Many of us here believe that. That is why we are here. I certainly \nknow that is why the Presiding Officer is here, who has so much \nbelieved in service in the various capacities that he has served his \nState and this Nation.\n  Harry Fritz is another who believes in service. I think it is \nimportant to honor and recognize people such as Harry, because the more \nHarry Fritzes there are in this country, in this world, by far, the \nmore quickly we are going to solve some mutual problems.\n  I again pay my highest compliments to a wonderful friend, a terrific \nman, and one of the best professors any student could ever have, \nProfessor Harry Fritz.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD.

Mr. President, the end of the 108th Congress marks the end \nof an era. It marks the end of a remarkable career of a remarkable man.\n  I will not say goodbye to Senator Hollings. His personality, his \nsense of humor, his achievements, his legacy will forever be a part of \nthis Chamber. But I do take a few minutes of the Senate's time to thank \nSenator Ernest Hollings.\n  I thank him for being an outstanding Senator. I thank him for his \nservice to our country. I thank him for being a friend. I have been \nhonored to call him my colleague for almost 40 years.\n  The man who is destined to become a legend in the political history \nof South Carolina politics was a New Year's Day baby. He was born on \nJanuary 1, 1922. After graduating from the Citadel, he served in the \nU.S. Army during World War II. This combat veteran, who served in North \nAfrica and in Europe, was awarded seven campaign stars and was \ndischarged with the rank of captain.\n  After the war, he earned his law degree from the University of South \nCarolina in 1947 and then began his extraordinary career in public \nservice in 1947. That was the year in which he earned his law degree.\n  In 1947, at the age of 26, he was elected to the South Carolina State \nLegislature where he served until 1954, while 1947 was the year in \nwhich I was sworn in at the West Virginia House of Delegates in \nCharleston, WV.\n  During his last 3 years in the South Carolina State Legislature, he \nserved as its speaker pro tempore.\n  In 1954, at the age of 32, he was elected Lieutenant Governor of \nSouth Carolina.\n  Four years later, in 1958, at the age of 36, he became one of the \nyoungest men ever elected Governor of his beloved State. From what I \nunderstand, he was an outstanding Governor. Senator Hollings would be \noutstanding in any office in which he would ever serve. He earned a \nreputation as the education Governor because he raised teachers' \nsalaries, launched new and innovative educational programs, including a \nsuperb technical training program, and set up a commission that \nimproved the State's higher education system.\n  In 1966 he was elected to the Senate. Here he has stayed for 38 \nyears. I am glad he stayed. He has been a very colorful Senator, an \noutstanding and outspoken Senator with a booming voice.\n  The stentorian voice could be heard, I am sure, throughout this \nChamber, without a public address system. When he first came here we \nhad no public address system in the Senate. When I first came here, we \nhad no public address system in the Senate, but we had Senators who \ncould be heard. It was a practice in those days for other Senators to \ngather closer to the Senator who was speaking. It was also a practice \nfor other Senators to be informed when a new Senator was going to \nspeak. New Senators did not speak the first week or the first month, \nbut only after several months did they speak. Before they spoke, the \nword went around that so and so was going to deliver his maiden speech \nor her maiden speech. In those days there was one lady in the Senate, \nMargaret Chase Smith of Maine. But we didn't have any public address \nsystem.\n\n  I recall when we started to discuss having a public address system in \nthe Senate, I was opposed to it. I wanted the Senate to remain the \nSenate of the decades that had preceded our own times.\n  But he was colorful and he was a Senator who had that booming voice \nthat could be projected and heard in the galleries, and today Senator \nHollings does not need a microphone.\n  He was from the old school of Senators who placed public interest \nover partisan politics. Oh, that we had more Senators like that, more \nSenators like Senator Hollings who put first the public's interest, the \ninterest of those people who are watching through that electronic eye \njust behind the Presiding Officer's desk; the eyes of the people come \nthrough that electronic eye, which extends the galleries beyond the \ncapacity that we see here. It extends those galleries out to the \noutermost parts of the country, north and south, out to the Pacific, \nout to the great Rocky Mountains, out to the broad prairies, out to the \nfarms, out to the hills of West Virginia, that great medium.\n  This Senator from South Carolina, unlike so many Senators of today, \nplaced the public interest over partisan politics. And he still does. \nHe never hesitated to criticize a President of his own political party \nas well as the opposition party when he knew in his heart and in his \nconscience that President\n\n[[Page S11459]]\n\nwas wrong. If it were a President of his own party, let it be.\n  While in the Senate, Senator Hollings has served on the Senate's \nBudget and Appropriations Committees, served as chairman of the Senate \nCommerce Committee, served as chairman of a number of Senate \nsubcommittees. Just as he had been a loyal and proud servant of his own \nState of South Carolina, he has been a loyal and proud servant of our \ncountry. In the Senate, he has been a forceful advocate of a \nresponsible energy policy. In fact, as early as 1967, Senator Hollings \nwas warning that our country faced a future of energy crises, and he \nwas calling for a national energy policy.\n\n  He authored legislation to create the Department of Energy and the \nAutomobile Fuel Economy Act that requires the miles-per-gallon sticker \non new cars.\n  He has been a determined advocate of a cleaner and healthier \nenvironment. In this effort, he formulated legislation to protect our \nmarine environment, sponsored legislation to prevent the dumping of \npolluting materials in the ocean, and authored the Coastal Zone \nManagement Act to protect our coastal waters and tidelands. He is the \nrecognized legislative ``father'' of the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration, NOAA.\n  In the Senate, Senator Hollings continued promoting technical \ntraining as he fought to establish trade schools that specialize in \nretraining workers and offer alternatives for people who choose not to \npursue a university degree.\n  In the Senate, Senator Hollings has tenaciously opposed trade deals \nthat threaten American jobs. Oh, if there were more like him. His \nfights in this area have involved opposing Presidents, opposing \nPresidents whom he charged were ``giving away the store'' in our trade \ntreaties. He has fought to protect and increase Social Security \nbenefits for our elderly Americans.\n  Concerned about the widespread poverty across the South, in 1968, he \nundertook a series of ``hunger tours'' that highlighted the issue. He \nlater authored a powerful study, ``The Case Against Hunger: A Demand \nfor a National Policy'' that advocated programs to address the \npersistence of abject poverty in the United States. Putting his words \ninto action, he helped lead the congressional effort to establish the \nWomen, Infants, and Children--WIC--nutritional assistance program, and \nhe helped to advance the Nation's community health centers, which \nprovide primary and preventive health services in underserved \ncommunities.\n  Long before the Bush administration's record-breaking budget \ndeficits, long before today's incredible $7 trillion national debt, \nSenator Hollings was an eloquent and powerful advocate of budget \ndiscipline. I did not always agree with his efforts, such as the Gramm-\nRudman-Hollings law, but I never questioned Senator Hollings's \ndedication to trying to restore fiscal sanity to America's deficit \naddictions.\n  Although he has long been a Senator of power and influence, during \nthe great majority of his time in this Chamber, he remained the junior \nSenator from his State. Even after serving 36 years in the Senate, he \nwas still outranked by his colleague from South Carolina, Senator Strom \nThurmond, making Senator Hollings the longest serving junior Senator in \nhistory, whatever that means. I have often wondered, having been a \njunior Senator and being a senior Senator now, what we mean by ``junior \nSenator''? Well, we know what it means, but that is all.\n  It was at the age of 80 that Senator Hollings finally became the \nsenior Senator from South Carolina. He had earned it. He had earned it \njust as he has earned the respect and the gratitude of the people of \nSouth Carolina and the men and the women in this Chamber.\n  Now, unfortunately, my friend and colleague is leaving us. Again, I \nwill not say farewell to him. I will only thank him for his service and \nwish him well in his private life.\n  I will always remember and cherish our years of working together on \nthe Appropriations Committee and for the best interests of our great \ncountry.\n\n     It isn't enough that we say in our hearts\n     That we like a man for his ways;\n     And it isn't enough that we fill our minds\n     With psalms of silent praise;\n     Nor is it enough that we honor a man\n     As our confidence upward mounts;\n     It's going right up to the man himself\n     And telling him so that counts.\n\n     Then when a man does a deed that you really admire,\n     Don't leave a kind word unsaid,\n     For fear to do so might make him vain\n     Or cause him to lose his head;\n     But reach out your hand and tell him, ``Well done'',\n     And see how his gratitude swells;\n     It isn't the flowers we strew on the grave,\n     It's the word to the living that tells.\n\n  Now, unfortunately, my friend and colleague--a strong colleague on \nthe Appropriations Committee, where we two have served all these many \nyears--is leaving us. Again, I will not say farewell to Senator \nHollings. I will only thank him for his service and wish him well in \nhis private life. I will always remember and cherish our years of \nworking together.\n  I shall always remember, too, that loyal, dedicated, devoted \nhelpmate, Peatsy, who stood always at his side, always there to be his \nbest confidant. Yes, Erma and I will miss Peatsy.\n  In closing, then, let me speak just a few words from the ``Character \nof the Happy Warrior'' by William Wordsworth, because I think they \nrepresent my feelings toward Ernest Fritz Hollings:\n\n     Who is the happy Warrior? Who is he\n     That every man in arms should wish to be?\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n     'Tis, finally, the Man, who, lifted high,\n     Conspicuous object in a Nation's eye,\n     Or left unthought-of in obscurity,--\n     Who, with a toward or untoward lot,\n     Prosperous or adverse, to his wish or not--\n     Plays, in the many games of life, that one\n     Where what he most doth value must be won:\n     Whom neither shape or danger can dismay,\n     Nor thought of tender happiness betray;\n     Who, not content that former worth stand fast,\n     Looks forward, persevering to the last,\n     From well to better, daily self-surpast:\n     Who, whether praise of him must walk the earth\n     For ever, and to noble deeds give birth,\n     Or he must fall, to sleep without his fame,\n     And leave a dead unprofitable name--\n     Finds comfort in himself and in his cause;\n     And, while the mortal mist is gathering, draws\n     His breath in confidence of Heaven's applause:\n     This is the happy Warrior; this is he\n     That every man in arms should wish to be.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I am happy to yield to the Senator from \nOklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the \nconclusion of the remarks of the junior Senator from Pennsylvania, I be \nrecognized to speak as in morning business for up to 25 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise very briefly to offer another \nunanimous consent request. This is a unanimous consent request on a \npiece of legislation that Senator Mikulski and I introduced earlier \nthis year regarding Polish visa waivers.\n  A visa waiver is a provision given in law to allow people from a \ncountry with which the United States has good relationships to come \ninto this country for a temporary period of time as visitors, tourists, \nwithout having to obtain a visa. In other words, this waives the visa \nrequirement that is generally imposed on people coming from other \ncountries to America. I believe we have done this with 27 other \ncountries because of the unique relationship we have with them and the \nbond that the countries have with the U.S.\n  Poland, unfortunately, has not been granted that status. If you look \nat the continent of Europe and at the great allies that we have on the \ncontinent of Europe, obviously, the two that come to mind--in my mind \nat least--are the Brits and the Italians. But Poland has shown, since \nits release from the Soviet Union's sphere of influence, a remarkable \naffinity for the United States and has shown tremendous strides and \nadvances both in terms of democracy, economy, and in their culture. It \nis very much a country that is leaning and facing west. It is, to me, a \nreal injustice to the people of that country, who have been our \nsteadfast supporters, particularly in the most recent\n\n[[Page S11460]]\n\nconflict in Iraq, that we would not present them the opportunity we do \nvirtually every other country in Europe.\n  Senator Mikulski agrees, I think, with the statements I have made, \nand she has said so on the floor of the Senate. We have been working in \nthe past couple of months to clear this legislation so it can pass the \nSenate and be sent to the House, with the hope, at this late date, of \nbecoming law but, if not, accelerating the opportunity for it to become \nlaw next year. Even at this late date, the hope is that once the bill \nwould get to the House, there would be the kind of support we have seen \nin the Senate to pass it. The support is nearly unanimous.\n  As we all know, at this point in time in the Senate, nearly unanimous \nisn't good enough. We need unanimous consent, or all Members of the \nSenate to agree. I can speak on behalf of the Republican side of the \naisle. I have spoken to all Senators, or their offices, and every \nRepublican Senator has agreed to allow this bill to clear the Senate \nand to pass today. We were willing to pass this bill before we broke in \nOctober. We were willing to give this bill a chance to become law and \nbe signed by this President. I am hopeful that he would sign this \nlegislation.\n  But I have been informed that in spite of the good efforts of Senator \nMikulski, we may not be able to clear this legislation on the other \nside of the aisle. That is a great disappointment to me and I know to \nSenator Mikulski. I know it is a great disappointment to many Polish \nAmericans--9.3 million Polish persons. Over 100,000 Poles per year come \nto this country to visit relatives and friends. Yet we cannot extend \nthis, I argue, minimal courtesy to those who have allied with us and \nhave shown their good hand of friendship toward us.\n  Mr. President, I will ask unanimous consent, in the hopes that maybe \neven later after this consent request, which I am told will be objected \nto, others will reconsider, and perhaps we can later tonight, or \ntomorrow, or Saturday, or however long we will be here, be able to work \nthrough this problem and get unanimous consent on this vitally \nimportant piece of legislation for not just the 9.3 million Poles in \nthis country, but for all of us in America who would like to extend a \nfurther hand of friendship and accord to the people of Poland who have \nbeen such steadfast allies of our great country.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of calendar 715, S. 2844.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object. I must say \nfor the record that there are Members who strongly support this bill--\nSenator Mikulski and others. However, on behalf of others, I must \nobject. Therefore, I do object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Thank you, Mr. President. I know the Senator from \nOklahoma intends to speak.\n  At this point, I ask unanimous consent that an explanation of this \nissue be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n S. 2844--Designating Poland as a Visa Waiver Country--Calendar No 715\n\n\n                        WHAT DOES THIS BILL DO?\n\n       Designates Poland as a visa waiver country. Citizens \n     visiting the U.S. within a 90-day period would not need to \n     apply for a visa.\n\n\n                     WHY SUPPORT THIS LEGISLATION?\n\n       Since the founding of the United States, Poland has proven \n     its steadfast dedication to the causes of freedom and \n     friendship with the United States. In addition, Polish \n     History provides pioneering examples of religious tolerance.\n       The United States is home to 9 million people of Polish \n     ancestry, including 429,000 in Florida, 854,000 in Michigan, \n     240,000 in Minnesota, 576,000 in New Jersey, 433,000 in Ohio, \n     824,146 in Pennsylvania, and 497,000 in Wisconsin. Polish \n     Immigrants have contributed greatly to the success of \n     industry and agriculture in the United States.\n       Since the demise of communism, Poland has become a stable, \n     democratic nation. Poland has adopted economic policies that \n     promote free markets and economic growth.\n       Poland demonstrated its commitment to global security by \n     becoming a member of NATO. Poland also just recently became a \n     member of the EU.\n       Poland was a staunch ally to the U.S. in Operation Iraqi \n     Freedom. Poland has committed 2,300 soldiers to help with \n     ongoing peace efforts in Iraq.\n       In 1991, Poland unilaterally repealed the visa requirement \n     for U.S. citizens traveling to Poland for less than 90 days. \n     And today, more than 100,000 Polish citizens travel to the \n     United States annually.\n\n\n                        POLISH VISA REFUSAL RATE\n\n       Refusal rate can be an inaccurate measure because it is \n     based on decisions made by consular officers rather than the \n     actual behavior of non-immigrants. It does not reflect the \n     propensity of nationals from that country to overstay their \n     visas.\n       Nonetheless, Poland's visa refusal rate is declining \n     dramatically, from around 43% in FY 03 to approximately 30% \n     in FY 04.\n       Polish citizens who apply for a visa have on average, a one \n     and a half minute interview. This obviously is not enough \n     time for a consular officer to make a decision on whether or \n     not they will overstay their visas. In other western European \n     countries, the average interview is five minutes.\n       Consular Officers still have a 1980s view of Poland, a \n     country in serious economic trouble and under tyranny. This \n     is an unfair view as Poland in now a stable, democratic \n     nation that promotes free markets and economic growth.\n       Warsaw airport is in the pilot program for airport \n     screening, so most Poles who would travel to the U.S. under \n     Visa Waiver would face an INS determination of whether they \n     will be admitted before they get on a plane.\n       Poland's refusal rate does not reflect a high propensity \n     for terrorism. The State Department has given no indication \n     that the potential for terrorism in Poland significantly \n     exceeds that of the 27 countries currently participating in \n     the Visa Waiver Program.\n\n\n       IMPORTANT TO SUPPORT OUR STRONG ALLY AT THIS CRUCIAL TIME\n\n       Poland was a staunch ally to the U.S. in Operation Iraqi \n     Freedom. Poland has committed 2,300 soldiers to help with \n     ongoing peace efforts in Iraq.\n       Though a staunch ally, Poland has legitimate concerns about \n     our appreciation of their efforts. President Aleksander \n     Kwasniewski reiterated these concerns when Poland was not \n     included as an ally in Iraq during the Presidential Debate.\n       As Lech Walesa said, this would be a very symbolic gesture \n     for both the government and the people of Poland. We owe the \n     Poles our appreciation for their camaraderie and sacrifice in \n     a pivotal point in our history. This legislation would go a \n     long way in showing our appreciation for their alliance with \n     us.\n\n\n        CURRENT PARTICIPANT COUNTRIES IN THE VISA WAIVER PROGRAM\n\n       Andorra, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brunei, Denmark, \n     Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, \n     Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, New \n     Zealand, Norway, Portugal, San Marino, Singapore, Slovenia, \n     Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, as I said before, I hope we can get \nagreement. I know there are one, or maybe more, Senators on the other \nside of the aisle who have found a concern with this. I ask that while \nthis is somewhat unusual in the way we put forth this legislation, it \nis vitally important for us to send a very strong and positive signal \nto one of our strongest allies in the world that we stand with them and \naccept them as one of our closest and dearest allies, and we will treat \nthem accordingly, with respect to the visitation of Polish people who \nvisit relatives and friends in the United States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nOklahoma is to be recognized for 25 minutes.\n  The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, if the Senator from Oklahoma comes, I will \nyield the floor quickly to him. At this moment, under the current \ncircumstances, I had sought to be recognized and I do so for the \npurpose of speaking for not more than 12 minutes. I ask unanimous \nconsent that I may be recognized for no more than 12 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, there is an old Chinese curse that says, \n``May you live in interesting times.'' A Senate equivalent of that \nsaying could very well be: May you lead the Senate in interesting \ntimes. If so, the Senate leadership of Senator Tom Daschle would \ncertainly qualify. He led the Senate with a very quiet integrity during \nsome of the most difficult times in American history.\n  In 1994, Senator Daschle became Senate Democratic leader by a single\n\n[[Page S11461]]\n\nvote. No sooner had he become Democratic leader than he was forced to \ndeal with the Republican revolution of 1994, including House Speaker \nNewt Gingrich and his short-lived ``Contract With America.'' I never \nread it, never signed it, and was not a disciple of it.\n  While he served as the Democratic leader for nearly a decade, there \nwas a period of 17 months in which he went from minority leader to \nmajority leader and back to minority leader.\n  He was the Senate Democratic leader during the first impeachment of \nan American President in 131 years. He was the Senate Democratic leader \non September 11, 2001, when America experienced the worst terrorist \nattack in the history of this great land. One month later, a \nbioterrorist attack on his Senate office in the Hart Building exposed \n20 of Tom Daschle's staffers to deadly anthrax spores.\n  As the Senate Democratic leader, Mr. Daschle has had to deal with \nthree different Republican leaders. During these turbulent \ncircumstances, he remained reassuring and inspiring. Tom Daschle's \nsoothing personality and his mild-mannered demeanor were comforting \nunder very trying circumstances.\n  Looking back, it seems strange that many people once considered this \nlikable, soft-spoken young man to be too likable and too soft spoken to \nbe an effective Senate leader. I am pleased and proud to say that we \nwere wrong. I say ``we'' because many people will recall that I \ninitially opposed his candidacy for Senate Democratic leadership. But \nafter Tom Daschle was elected leader, I was impressed as I found him to \nbe an engaging man with whom to work, a most interesting man, a leader \nwho has a way of putting other people at ease, even in troubled as well \nas in pleasant times.\n  He was always working to seek a consensus. He was always listening. \nHe was one of the best listeners I have ever met during my 46 years in \nthis body.\n  Even in the Senate's darkest moments, he retained his sense of \noptimism, always preferring to see the glass as half full rather than \nhalf empty. And that optimism was infectious. Therefore, 2 years later, \nit was my pleasure to nominate Tom Daschle for reelection as Senate \nDemocratic leader. In nominating him, I announced:\n\n       I was totally wrong about this young man. He has steel in \n     his spine, despite his reasonable and modest demeanor.\n\n  As a former Senate leader myself, I can say that a Senate leader who \ncan bring together and develop a consensus on tough controversial \nmeasures must have the patience of Job and the wisdom of Solomon.\n  As a former Senate Democratic leader, I want to express my gratitude \nto Mr. Daschle for the service that he rendered to this Chamber, to our \nNation, and to our political party.\n  During the interesting times in which he led the Senate, Senator \nDaschle was always working for the common good. Because of his \nprincipled--let me say that again--because of his principled opposition \nto the Bush administration, critics denounced and demonized him as an \nobstructionist. If placing the national good over blind obedience to \nany President makes a Senator an obstructionist, then let me say that \nour democracy--indeed, all democracies--need more Tom Daschle's.\n  Senator Daschle stayed above it all, as he refused to engage in the \ngutter politics of his opponents. He always retained and maintained the \ndignity that has characterized him as a man and as a Senator. But then \nthis mild-mannered South Dakota Democrat, the only South Dakotan ever \nto be elected to the Senate leadership, has always served the people of \nhis State and the people of our Nation proudly and honorably, with \ndiligence, sincerity, and distinction.\n  His entire career in public service has been based on standing up for \nthe common good. He has been a true friend of rural America, especially \nAmerica's farmers. Among the many measures he promoted to benefit \nAmerican farmers, Senator Daschle pushed the development and the \ncommercialization of alternative agricultural products.\n\n  He was an aggressive advocate of health issues, having authored \nlegislation that expanded health services in rural areas.\n  As a veteran himself, having served as an intelligence officer in the \nStrategic Air Command of the U.S. Air Force, Tom Daschle was a powerful \nadvocate for American veterans. In 1991, he won his 11-year struggle \nfor legislation to assist Vietnam veterans suffering from exposure to \nAgent Orange.\n  I am sorry that I must now say goodbye to this decent man and this \noutstanding Senator, especially in such circumstances. And he is a \ndecent man. He was always good to me. He was always listening. He \nalways listened to whatever I had to suggest to him--always listening \nand always tried to be helpful. So many times he spoke good words \nconcerning me. He was always asking about my wife Erma: How is your \nwife? How is your wife Erma?\n  But as anyone involved in politics knows, political life has its \ndefeats as well as its victories, its sorrows as well as its joys, and \nwe must accept them as they come, always looking forward, not backward, \nand knowing that the future will present other opportunities to serve \nour Nation.\n  I hope that Senator Daschle will continue a life of public service \nbecause our Nation will always need men of his background and \nexperiences but, most importantly, his wisdom, his integrity, and his \noptimism.\n  Let me say on behalf of Erma and myself that we are so grateful to \nSenator Daschle and his lovely wife for their many courtesies extended \nto us, their many kindnesses which we will never forget. I am confident \nthat despite the happenings of November 2, Senator Daschle still sees \nthe glass as half full rather than half empty.\n  And so my wife Erma and I extend our best wishes to Senator Daschle \nand his wife Linda in all of their future endeavors.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN.

Mr. President, recently there has been a lot of \ndiscussion about, not just the role of the judiciary in our democracy, \nbut the process by which judges are selected. To me, this all boils \ndown to something that Daniel Webster once said when he opined that \n``justice is the greatest desire of man on Earth.'' It is, in fact, the \njudges, the ones who wear the black robe, the men or women who serve on \nlocal or State or Federal benches who are the ones with whom we \nidentify that common yearning for justice.\n  Unfortunately, here in the Senate over the last couple of years, we \nhave gone through an experience that not only reeks of injustice but \nalso of unfairness and, indeed, rises to the level of \nunconstitutionality when it comes to the filibuster used against \nPresident Bush's judicial nominees.\n  Never, before these last 2 years, has a nominee for a Federal court, \nwhether it is the Federal district court or circuit court or the United \nStates Supreme Court, been blocked by the use of a filibuster when \nthere was a bipartisan majority of the Senate who stood ready to \nconfirm that judge--never before the current Congress, dating back now \n2 years.\n  We all know the judiciary plays a critical role in our form of \ngovernment. As high school students, or perhaps even earlier, we learn \nthat our three branches of government play important but distinct roles \nin our constitutional democracy. It is the judiciary, which at one time \nin our Nation's history has been called the least dangerous branch, \nthat has produced some of the most dangerous decisions, at least so far \nas it concerns our right to self-government. What I mean by that is \nwhen we see courts strike down the Pledge of Allegiance because \nschoolchildren cannot say the words ``under God'' when they pledge \nallegiance to the flag; when we see county clerks, indeed, when we see \njudges themselves\n\n[[Page S11462]]\n\nauthorize the issuance of marriage licenses to same-sex couples on TV \nand across our country; and when we see courts, on the basis of \nlawsuits that have been filed, tell military bases that they cannot \ngrant access to their facilities to the Boy Scouts of America, we know \nthese are not a product of a vote of the people.\n  In each of those instances it is the act or the dictate of a judge, a \njudge that I submit has lost any tether, any sort of anchor with the \nfundamental premises upon which the power of a judge is granted.\n  We want to make sure in this country, I believe, whether we are \nDemocrats, Republicans or independents, that our judges are not \npoliticized. In other words, we want to make sure when we walk into a \ncourtroom when our case is decided that the judges have not already \nmade up their minds before hearing what the facts are. We want to make \nsure that that judge does not have some sort of political or personal \nagenda which makes it impossible for them to be fair.\n  But what we have seen over the last couple of years is a political \nsituation of the judicial selection process where good men and women \nwho are highly qualified to serve as Federal judges at the Federal \ndistrict court level and at the circuit court level have been not only \nobstructed by this unconstitutional filibuster process, which has never \nbefore been used in America history--what we have seen is also \ncharacter assassination. We have seen individuals who spent a lifetime \ncreating a reputation and developing a career as a judge totally \nsmeared by various interest groups whose desire it is to politicize not \nonly the judicial selection process but the decisionmaking process by \njudges. And that is wrong.\n  We know, in addition to the other important judicial vacancies that \nexist around this country which we have been unable to fill because of \nthe filibuster, that in all likelihood during President Bush's second \nterm of office he will have the opportunity to nominate one or more \nnominees to the U.S. Supreme Court. I am sorry to say these nominees \nwill undoubtedly be savaged by some of these same interest groups who \nare bound and determined to politicize not only the act of judging--\nthat quest for justice--but in fact the selection process itself. \nUnfortunately, these kinds of venomous politics are something we have \ncome too often to expect when it comes to selecting these important \nmembers of the judiciary.\n  I firmly believe we are a big and diverse country. We have people who \ncome from different places across the planet, who pronounce their name \nin different ways, who have different traditions, creeds, beliefs. And \nthe great thing about this country is we can all live here in this one \nplace and we can argue for what we strongly believe in. We can defend \nthose views when they are attacked. But in the end, we settle those \ndisputes--maybe not change someone's mind but we settle the dispute at \nleast for a while by having an election.\n  On November 2 of this year, 60 million people not only chose to \nreelect President George W. Bush, but I believe in part cast their \nvotes for the kind of judicial nominees this President has nominated in \nthe past and which he can be expected to nominate in the future.\n  Men and women are drawn to service in the judiciary because they \nbelieve in that quest for justice, and they want to play an important \nrole in making sure that desire for justice, that quest for justice, is \nsatisfied, at least as much as is humanly possible, in courtrooms all \nacross this country.\n  But we know--at least in the past, based on sad experience--there are \nthose who will not be satisfied with an election; that people will not \nput their grievances and their anger behind them but will continue to \npursue these policies of destruction and character assassination when \nit comes to the President's judicial nominees. Unfortunately, these \nangry individuals have not come to accept what the vast majority of \nAmericans have agreed is the way we should work; that is, we do our \nbest, we fight our best fight, we get our voters out, and then we have \nan election and we resolve those differences at the election.\n\n  We have seen time and time again how these tactics have been used \nshamelessly to smear some of the President's judicial nominees. It is \nonly logical to expect some of these same tactics, notwithstanding what \nI have said, will be used again.\n  What we have seen in this Senate--and I believe the American people \ncast a vote, at least in part, on November 2--is, as I have said, \nunconstitutional filibusters. And what I believe the American people \ncast a vote on on November 2, particularly when it came to the Senate \nminority leader race, the race in South Dakota, was a repudiation of \nobstructionism and the unconstitutional use of the filibuster to block \nthe President's nominees who, if allowed the simple dignity of an up-\nor-down vote, would have been confirmed as I speak.\n  The Constitution makes clear what the role of the Senate is. That \nrole is to provide advice and consent. Yes. The Judiciary Committee, on \nwhich I am honored to serve, has a responsibility to review the \ncredentials and background and experience, the temperament of these \nnominees to make sure they understand they are not just another branch \nof the legislature which is at liberty to enact through judicial edict \ntheir personal or political or any other agenda. Our job is to make \nsure they respect the separation of powers which makes the judiciary a \ndistinct and unique branch which is supposed to interpret the law, not \nmake the law.\n  Unfortunately, we have seen an obstinate minority in this body that \nhas denied this Congress the ability to provide that advice and \nconsent; that is, trying to elevate the de facto requirement under the \nConstitution for confirmation to 60 votes by claiming that the Senate \nrule which requires 60 votes to cut off debate trumped the \nConstitution.\n  You might ask, How is that possible? The Constitution is the \nfundamental law of the United States of America, and all other laws \npassed, including those of Congress, are inferior to that law. If the \nact of Congress is inferior to that law and when it conflicts, it must \nfall, surely a Senate rule that purports to require a supermajority \nvote of the Senate to confirm judges must fall when there is conflict \nwith the U.S. Constitution.\n  The Constitution provides that in specific but limited instances a \nsupermajority vote is required for passage, notably the ratification of \ntreaties and notably the amendment of the Constitution itself. But \nnowhere in the Constitution is it provided that to confirm a judge, \nmore than a 51-vote majority is required.\n  That is why over these last 2 years we have heard Members on this \nside of the aisle time and time again come to the Senate and say not \nonly is this filibuster unfair, but, indeed, blocking an up-or-down \nvote by a bipartisan majority of this body is, in fact, in violation of \nthe fundamental law of our land.\n  In order to be suited by virtue of temperament to serve in elected \noffice, you have to be an optimist by nature, and I am. It is my \nsincere hope, it is my sincere request and entreaty to our colleagues \non the other side of the aisle, that these tactics stop. They must stop \nnot only for the good of the Senate but out of respect to the President \nwho received almost 60 million votes on November 2 and out of respect \nfor the Constitution itself. What has happened these last 2 years is \nwrong, it is unfair, and, indeed, it is unconstitutional.\n  Should President Bush have the opportunity to nominate one or more \njudges to vacancies on the U.S. Supreme Court, it is my sincere hope we \nwill have learned something from the mistakes of the past. We will have \nalso learned there is a political penalty to be paid for obstructing \njudges, for treating them unfairly and in an unconstitutional fashion.\n  As an astute observer not only of the human condition but also of \npolitics in general, I am confident that all of my colleagues in the \nSenate, all 100, paid close attention to the verdict of the American \npeople on November 2 when it came to a referendum on whether these \nunconstitutional, unfair obstructionist tactics should continue or end. \nIt is my hope we all got the same message and that, indeed, we will \ntreat the President's nominees fairly, that we will do what the \nConstitution requires, that we ask the questions, make sure they are \nqualified by virtue of experience, education, and temperament, that \nthey understand what the role of\n\n[[Page S11463]]\n\nthe judge is, and that they are not just a legislator wearing a black \nrobe and with lifetime tenure.\n  I believe on November 2 the American people rejected the tactics of \nobstructionism and demonization of the President's nominees. Frankly, I \nworry that the good men and women who have been nominated by the \nPresident to serve in these important positions, after those behind \nthem see how they have been treated, or I should say mistreated, how \nlong can we expect other good men and women, when called by the \nPresident, will answer the call only to know they will be smeared, \nstrung out before the world and, indeed, then, obstructed by an \nunconstitutional process?\n  It is my hope we will have learned something over these last 2 years \nand to repudiate these tactics.\n  I will say something to my constituents and the people who may be \nlistening who have contacted my office in very sincere concern for what \nthey have seen played out on the Senate floor and in the judicial \nconfirmation process.\n  I say to all of them, I appreciate your passion. I appreciate your \nconcern. I appreciate your interest in the instruments of the \nGovernment that ultimately the people of this country control. We are \ngoing to need the involvement, the attention, the passion of all of the \npeople and, indeed, we are going to need to appeal to our better angels \nin the Senate and in the Senate Judiciary Committee when it comes to \nthe next nominees for the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  We all remember, whether it is the confirmation process by which \nJudge Bork was blocked, by which Clarence Thomas was ultimately \nconfirmed--after going through a process that no one should have to go \nthrough--my hope is we will have learned that is not the way the Senate \nshould conduct itself and that we will resolve among ourselves and \nresolve among the American people and to the people we represent that \nwe will treat the President's judicial nominees fairly, that we will \ntreat them with dignity, and that we will provide the up-or-down vote \nthe U.S. Constitution demands when it comes to the confirmation of the \nPresident's judicial nominees.\n\n  I am not suggesting for a minute that anyone violate their \nconscience. Indeed, any Senator with a sincere belief that an \nindividual judge should not be confirmed should come to the Senate, as \nno doubt they will, and explain to their colleagues why they feel so \nstrongly, why they conscientiously object to this nominee and invoke \ntheir conscience. Every Senator should do that, and I trust they will.\n  But no one, no Senator has the right, no group of Senators has the \nright, no minority has the right to tyrannize the majority of the \nSenate when we stand ready in a bipartisan fashion to cast a vote, up \nor down, for a judicial nominee.\n  I sincerely hope we will not have only learned from the mistakes of \nthe past when it comes to obstruction of the President's judicial \nnominees, but we will conduct ourselves with the kind of dignity the \nAmerican people have come to expect from Senators and that we will \nconduct ourselves uprightly, with fairness and dignity, and treat all \nwe come in contact exactly the same way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I intend to speak on another matter at \nsome point. I see several of my colleagues are in the Senate. Senator \nLevin, I believe, wishes to speak for a short time. I see Senator Bond \nis in the Senate, as well.\n  I will take 5 minutes to say I have deep respect for my colleague \nfrom Texas. I like him and I am pleased he is a Member of this body. I \nhave deep disagreement with what he has said, and I will take this \nmoment to respond to it.\n  There is a newfound passion, apparently, for providing votes for \nnominees for judgeships. When I say a newfound passion, let me explain \nthat I was here in the 1990s. There were 60 nominees for the Federal \ncourt that never got a vote in the Senate by a Republican-controlled \nSenate. Many of them never even got 1 day of hearings. It was \nunbelievable what went on with the majority party in this Chamber when \nthe Clinton administration was sending down nominees.\n  Contrary to what my colleague just indicated, this notion of \nobstructionism, this is a newfound technique. You create your own \nreality and debate from that reality. There was no obstructionism. This \nSenate approved 201 Federal judges; 201 of the nominations for Federal \njudgeships that were sent down here by this President. We held up about \n10 of them.\n  Now, the Constitution says something about our obligations. This is \nnot about obstruction. It is not about unconstitutional behavior. It is \nnot anything of the sort. It is about those in the Senate who \nunderstand that the Constitution says we have a responsibility when it \ncomes to putting someone on the Federal bench for a lifetime.\n  When someone sends a name to this Senate as this President did that \nsays, I want this man to serve for a lifetime on the Federal bench--by \nthe way, this person has a record of writing articles saying that his \nbelief is that women are subservient to men--I say, wait a second. It \nis not somebody I want to sit on the Federal bench for a lifetime. I \ndon't happen to think that sort of thinking represents what I want to \nput on the Federal bench.\n  We held up, I believe, 10 nominees and approved 201. We approved 93 \npercent of the President's requests. We are told this is \nobstructionism? And now we are told, today, there is a lesson in the \nSouth Dakota Senate race as a result of this? This ``obstructionism'' \ncreated a result in the Senate race in South Dakota of which we all \nneed to be mindful?\n  Let me state what the South Dakota Senate race was about. It was not \nabout obstructionism and judgeships. It was about $20 million coming \nout of the basement of the White House through various orifices and \ndevices, directed at the minority leader in the State of South Dakota \nin a campaign that in many respects, in my judgment, was shameful. But \nit was not about obstructionism. It was not about judges because the \nfact is we approved 201 Federal nominees sent to us by this President. \nWe have been extraordinarily cooperative.\n\n  Let me say again, I was here during 8 years of the Clinton \nadministration when 60 nominees were sent down here that never got a \nvote. Some of them never got one day of hearings. Let me say that on my \nbehalf I want to cooperate with this President. But my colleagues and I \nhave constitutional responsibilities with respect to putting someone on \na Federal bench for a lifetime that involves two steps: One, the \nPresident proposes a nominee; and, second, under advice and consent, \nthe Senate then makes its judgement. We have a responsibility here. It \nis a constitutional responsibility.\n  I have read and reread that Constitution. I am proud of what we have \ndone. We have been extraordinarily cooperative with this President and \nwill continue to be so. But that does not mean all of us walk to this \nChamber with ink on our shoes and become a giant rubber stamp to say: \nMe too. Yes, sign me up. OK, I am fine, I am with you. It is not our \nrole and it is not our responsibility.\n  When we approved 201 Federal nominees to the Federal court from this \nPresident, which was 93 percent of the nominees of this President, I \nthink it strains credibility to somehow call this obstructionism. And \nit certainly strains our sense of irony to hear those calling us \nobstructionists when not very long ago there were 60 nominees, some of \nwhich never got a day of hearings, and none of which got a vote on the \nfloor of the Senate.\n  Going forward, I think we ought to understand this: The so-called \nlesson we were described moments ago about the election in South \nDakota, that is all nonsense. It is not what that was about. We believe \nwe have a responsibility to cooperate. We will. We also believe we have \na constitutional responsibility to use our heads, our hearts and our \nminds to make good decisions about the future of this country. We will \ncontinue to do that as well.\n\n  Incidentally, I have in my hand a record of two votes during the \nClinton administration where there were cloture motions that were \nrequired for nominees. So this notion that somehow it is the first time \never there was a filibuster, nonsense, that's just not true.\n\n[[Page S11464]]\n\n  I have records of both votes. It has been done before. It has been \ndone by the majority party. It is just when they do not get 100 percent \nof their nominees, they do not get a rubber stamp coming out of this \nChamber, that somehow they have a problem with that. The American \npeople should not have a problem with it. The Constitution certainly \ndoes not have a problem with it, and I do not.\n  I want to be cooperative, but I do not want to sit and listen to a \nre-creation of reality that does not square with what we have done in \nthe Senate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wonder if I could ask unanimous consent \nto line up speakers. Does the Senator from North Dakota want to do \nthat? And is that agreeable to the Senator from Missouri and the \nSenator from Oklahoma that speakers be lined up by unanimous consent? \nWhen I asked Senator Dorgan to yield to me for 5 minutes, he was \nwondering if he could then be next in order. But I know Senator Bond is \nhere, too.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me follow Senator Bond.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Yes. If I could ask the Senator from North Dakota about \nhow much time will he be using?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I intended to use 20 minutes. I would be happy to follow \nthe Senator.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I would be close to that amount of time, too, so I will \ngo ahead and wait. If I could lock in after the Senator from North \nDakota, that is fine.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me suggest the Senator from Michigan \nbegin, and then be followed by the Senator from Missouri, and then \nmyself, followed by the Senator from Oklahoma. I ask unanimous consent \nthat be the order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/18/senate-section/article/S11464-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11464]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CLOTURE VOTES FOR JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, while Senator Dorgan is in the Chamber, he \nmade reference to the fact there have been cloture votes required on \njudges throughout the years. I want to expand on the Record some of the \nnames of judges where cloture votes were required, in fact, where \ncloture votes were not agreed to and led to their defeat in a number of \ninstances: Justice Fortas in 1968; now Justice Bryer but then circuit \ncourt nominee Steven Bryer in 1980, with two cloture motions; Rosemary \nBarkett, to the Eleventh Circuit in 1994; Lee Sarokin in 1994, with a \ncloture motion required; Marsha Berzon in the year 2000; Richard Paez \nin the year 2000.\n\n  Cloture is not a new phenomenon when it comes to the debate over \njudges. Yet we hear now that suddenly the requirement that there be a \ncloture vote is something that is new to this Senate. It is not. It has \nbeen historically used. It is appropriate, and it is rare.\n  As Senator Dorgan pointed out, 93 percent of the judges who were \nnominated by President Bush were confirmed when there were votes that \ncame to the floor of the Senate. Ninety-three percent of these judges \nwere confirmed. And the comparison to that of the Clinton years, where \nso many judges could not even get a hearing, where there was a \nfilibuster in the Judiciary Committee because of the refusal to grant \njudges a hearing, is quite a contrast. We do not hear much about that. \nInstead, hearing that the refusal to have an up-or-down vote and a \nrequirement for cloture is somehow labeled obstructionism is altogether \nout of line, as far as I am concerned, and inaccurate historically, \ninappropriate, and needs to be contested.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/18/senate-section/article/S11464-2", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11464]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTES TO RETIRING SENATORS\n\n\n                              Tom Daschle\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, that is not why I came to the floor, \nalthough it relates to why I came to the floor this afternoon because I \ncame here to pay tribute to a dear friend, our Democratic leader, Tom \nDaschle of South Dakota. This sadness is only tempered by the belief \nthat Tom Daschle will continue to play a vital role in our Nation's \npublic life in the future.\n  Tom Daschle has had a distinguished career as a legislator on behalf \nof the interests of the people of South Dakota and all of the people of \nour Nation. He has fought for a fair share for the farmers of his State \nand for farmers around the country. He has been in the forefront of \nrural health, veterans' health, a fair tax system, and a very broad \nrange of other issues.\n  He has been as a leader of the Democrats in the Senate, both as \nmajority leader and minority leader, through one of the most difficult \nperiods of the Senate's history where Tom Daschle has made his mark. He \nhas been a remarkable leader. As a principled and tireless advocate for \nthe issues he believes in, he has led by example. On countless \ndifficult and contentious issues, he has led by carefully listening to \nall sides. Time and time again, on complex and challenging legislation, \nhe has led by tireless negotiation and by building consensus. And, \nwhere appropriate, he has been able to organize Democrats to insist on \nour rights as a minority in the Senate.\n  It is, indeed, a bitter irony of the most recent election that Tom \nDaschle, who is a legislator to the core, and a man of compromise and \nsoft-spoken wisdom, a seeker of dialogue, solutions, and consensus, was \ncaricatured as an obstructionist. In the time-honored tradition of \nSenate leaders of both parties, he stood tall when principle required \nit. In reality, though, it was Tom Daschle's style to reach across the \naisle, time and time again, in an effort to legislate in the Nation's \nbest interest. Often he worked closely with the Republican leader in \nsome of the Senate's finest and most difficult hours.\n  In the face of a very difficult impeachment trial that tested this \nSenate, in response to the September 11 terrorist attacks, and when he \nhimself was targeted in the anthrax attack, as in countless other \ninstances, Tom Daschle demonstrated his talent for calm, inclusive, and \nwise leadership.\n  As this session of Congress ends in the next few days, the people of \nSouth Dakota will be losing a vigorous, effective, and committed \nSenator. Democrats in this body, indeed, all Senators, will be losing a \ngreat leader. And all Americans will be losing a voice of reason, \njudgment, and wisdom. I will be losing a friend and a confidante. Tom \nDaschle is a beautiful human being and a nonpareil leader. His good \nnature will enable him to overcome this momentary defeat so that the \ncontributions he makes to public life will soon flower in a different \nplace.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Shelby \nbe recognized for 10 minutes following me, and that Senator Breaux be \nrecognized for 15 minutes thereafter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am here today to talk about an old-\nfashioned virtue: doing what you said you were going to do. That is a \ntest a lot of people apply in politics. They say if you tell us what \nyou are going to do when you get elected, are you going to do it?\n  It seems to me in the intelligence field we have an example of that. \nThe reaction is somewhat surprising. We have had, I think, 128 or 130 \nhearings in the Intelligence Committee since I joined it in January \n2003. One of the lessons we learned is that, while there are many \noutstanding dedicated men and women in the CIA and throughout the \nintelligence community, the system is broken; it didn't give us the \nadequate or accurate prediction of the scope of the terrorist danger to \nthe U.S. before 9/11. We went into Iraq with the Director of Central \nIntelligence so confident of the intelligence analysis\n\n[[Page S11465]]\n\nthat we would find weapons of mass destruction that he advised the \nPresident it was a ``slam dunk.''\n  We now find out that while there was great danger in Iraq, it was \nvery different from the danger that the CIA had assessed. The estimates \nwere really faulty. We have seen this. The CIA and the intelligence \ncommunity, as I said, have outstanding, dedicated people; but they are \nnot focused properly on doing the job that the new worldwide threat of \nan unrelenting, vicious, terrorist war directed at us and all free-\nminded people presents. So everybody came to the conclusion there \nneeded to be a new direction.\n  The President nominated one of the Members of Congress who had done a \ngreat deal of oversight of the CIA and actually had served in the \nclandestine service himself, Porter Goss of Florida. Everybody said \nthey wanted change. Porter Goss told the President and the Congress in \nhis confirmation hearings that we are going to make some changes. He \nwent over to the CIA. He is making some changes. What a surprise. The \ncritics are now saying he is making changes at the CIA. I am a little \nbit confused about what they thought he was going to do. If he didn't \nmake changes at the CIA, that is when I think we should be challenging \nhim.\n\n  Something has to change. I have spoken with Director Goss, and I know \nour chairman, Senator Roberts, has. We both have confidence in his \nability, because it appears to us that Director Goss is doing exactly \nwhat he told Congress he would do, and that is to make changes in order \nto improve the CIA.\n  Why are we surprised or critical that there is a change with new \nleadership? Obviously, changing means there are going to be some people \nwho are going to be displaced. We thank them for their service and wish \nthem well. But why are we arguing over the fact that some people are \ngoing to be removed or replaced?\n  Director Goss testified at his confirmation hearing that he would \nmake changes that emphasize the CIA's missions and capability and focus \non delivering a better product to the President and Congress. That is \nbecause, as I said, we have had report after report, including the \nSenate's inquiry that we spent a lot of time putting together, that \nshows failures at many levels within the CIA, resulting in an \ninadequate product presented to us and the administration. The status \nquo is not acceptable.\n  Director Goss has a very big challenge ahead of him. We need to give \nhim room to address it. Change is tough, people don't like it, but it \nis necessary. Take two aspirins and call me in the morning. Sit back \nand take a deep breath and don't get upset because he is making \nchanges.\n  There are some critics who are going after him tooth and toenail. I \nbelieve the New York Times had a headline today that said ``New CIA \nChief Tells Workers to Back Administration Policies.'' Wait a minute. \nThat is not what he said. I have the copy of the statement Director \nGoss made. He said that we will support the administration, but he says \nwe will provide intelligence to support it. We don't come out and argue \nfor it. He said that as agency employees, we do not identify with, \nsupport, or champion opposition to the administration or its policies. \nWe provide the intelligence as we see it and let the facts alone speak \nto the policymaker. In other words, their support is by providing the \nbest intelligence estimates available.\n  Now, Michael Scheuer, who wrote that anonymous book and made \nheadlines with the ``Imperial Hubris'' book, criticized timid \nleadership at CIA. Why are we criticizing the DCI for shaking up the \nmanagement? If the Director of CIA is making mistakes, or if he is \ngoing down the wrong path, we on the Intelligence Committees here and \nin the House are going to be monitoring the situation. If we see there \nis a problem, we are in a position to call him on it or to point out \nremedies that are needed. But, so far, I see a man willing to take on \nan entrenched and some might stay constipated bureaucracy.\n  Many of the senior intelligence officials to quit have been with the \nagency for decades. It is a shame we are going to lose that experience, \nbut some would say--and I agree--new blood is needed at the CIA.\n\n  I am encouraged that Director Goss is willing to shake things up at \nthe CIA. I hope he employs the same vigor in getting the rest of the \nintelligence community to work together and share information with each \nother.\n  Some of the people who are leaving and whining, I question their \nmettle. There are thousands of soldiers and marines in Afghanistan and \nIraq, including special forces, who are yelled at every day by their \nsergeants, not to mention being shot at and living in the mud. I am \nglad they all have the fortitude to say: I am not going to quit because \nI am yelled at or somebody doesn't like what I am doing.\n  Perhaps these CIA officers should remember their mission and work \nwith the DCI as the quiet service, keep their mouths shut, and work \nwithin the system to provide the best intelligence for the \nadministration, for the Congress, and for the warfighters who need to \nrely on it and whose lives depend upon it.\n  Parochialism is one of the CIA's biggest problems. These career CIA \nofficers, while having valuable experience, also carry the baggage of \nbeing resistant to change. The status quo may be comfortable to them, \nbut it is dangerous to the country.\n  We on the Intelligence Committee have heard CIA officers say that \neverything is just fine, no changes are needed. Those people are \nclearly in a state of denial.\n  We on the Intelligence Committee take our oversight responsibilities \nseriously and will, of course, address legitimate concerns over how \nDirector Goss is running the intelligence community. We appointed and \nconfirmed him to make difficult changes, and I don't think it is \nappropriate to jump to conclusions or second-guess his management \nstyle.\n  I thank the Chair and my colleagues.

Mr. President, this morning in the newspaper we read a \nreport of that which we know, that the administration is going to \npropose a Tax Code overhaul. I think almost every American would \nbelieve that it is worth overhauling the Tax Code. The Tax Code is so \ncomplicated, and it desperately needs an overhaul.\n  The headline reads: ``Bush Plans Tax Code Overhaul. Changes Would \nFavor Investment, Growth.''\n  It says:\n\n       The Bush administration is eyeing an overhaul of the tax \n     code that would drastically cut, if not eliminate, taxes on \n     savings and investment . . . .\n\n  I want to read just for a moment an op-ed piece that appeared in the \nWashington Post. It is an op-ed piece written by I believe the second \nrichest man in the world, Warren Buffett. Warren is a charming, \ndelightful man. I had the opportunity to get to know him some. He has \nbeen incredibly successful as an American businessman. He wrote an op-\ned piece about taxes and the tax burden that I want to read into the \nRecord.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print his entire op-ed piece in the \nRecord. It is entitled ``Dividend Voodoo.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 20, 2003]\n\n                            Dividend Voodoo\n\n                          (By Warren Buffett)\n\n       The annual Forbes 400 lists prove that--with occasional \n     blips--the rich do indeed get richer. Nonetheless, the Senate \n     voted last week to supply major aid to the rich in their \n     pursuit of even greater wealth.\n       The Senate decided that the dividends an individual \n     receives should be 50 percent free of tax in 2003, 100 \n     percent tax-free in 2004 through 2006 and then again fully \n     taxable in 2007. The mental flexibility the Senate \n     demonstrated in crafting these zigzags is breathtaking. What \n     it has put in motion, though, is clear: If enacted, these \n     changes would further tilt the tax scales toward the rich.\n       Let me, as a member of that non-endangered species, give \n     you an example of how the scales are currently balanced. The \n     taxes I pay to the federal government, including the payroll \n     tax that is paid for me by my employer, Berkshire Hathaway, \n     are roughly the\n\n[[Page S11466]]\n\n     same proportion of my income--about 30 percent--as that paid \n     by the receptionist in our office. My case is not atypical--\n     my earnings, like those of many rich people, are a mix of \n     capital gains and ordinary income--nor is it affected by tax \n     shelters (I've never used any). As it works out, I pay a \n     somewhat higher rate for my combination of salary, investment \n     and capital gain income than our receptionist does. But she \n     pays a far higher portion of her income in payroll taxes than \n     I do.\n       She's not complaining: Both of us know we were lucky to be \n     born in America. But I was luckier in that I came wired at \n     birth with a talent for capital allocation--a valuable \n     ability to have had in this country during the past half-\n     century. Credit America for most of this value, not me. If \n     the receptionist and I had both been born in, say, \n     Bangladesh, the story would have been far different. There, \n     the market value of our respective talents would not have \n     varied greatly.\n       Now the Senate says that dividends should be tax-free to \n     recipients. Suppose this measure goes through and the \n     directors of Berkshire Hathaway (which does not now pay a \n     dividend) therefore decide to pay $1 billion in dividends \n     next year. Owning 31 percent of Berkshire, I would receive \n     $310 million in additional income, owe not another dime in \n     federal tax, and see my tax rate plunge to 3 percent.\n       And our receptionist? She'd still be paying about 30 \n     percent, which means she would be contributing about 10 times \n     the proportion of her income that I would to such government \n     pursuits as fighting terrorism, waging wars and supporting \n     the elderly. Let me repeat the point: Her overall federal tax \n     rate would be 10 times what my rate would be.\n       When I was young, President Kennedy asked Americans to \n     ``pay any price, bear any burden'' for our country. Against \n     that challenge, the 3 percent overall federal tax rate I \n     would pay--if a Berkshire dividend were to be tax-free--seems \n     a bit light.\n       Administration officials say that the $310 million suddenly \n     added to my wallet would stimulate the economy because I \n     would invest it and thereby create jobs. But they \n     conveniently forget that If Berkshire kept the money, it \n     would invest that same amount, creating jobs as well.\n       The Senate's plan invites corporations--indeed, virtually \n     commands them--to contort their behavior in a major way. Were \n     the plan to be enacted, shareholders would logically respond \n     by asking the corporations they own to pay no more dividends \n     in 2003, when they would be partially taxed, but instead to \n     pay the skipped amounts in 2004, when they'd be tax-free. \n     Similarly, in 2006, the last year of the plan, companies \n     should pay double their normal dividend and then avoid \n     dividends altogether in 2007.\n       Overall, it's hard to conceive of anything sillier than the \n     schedule the Senate has laid out. Indeed, the first President \n     Bush had a name for such activities: ``voodoo economics.'' \n     The manipulation of enactment and sunset dates of tax changes \n     is Enron-style accounting, and a Congress that has recently \n     demanded honest corporate numbers should now look hard at its \n     own practices.\n       Proponents of cutting tax rates on dividends argue that the \n     move will stimulate the economy. A large amount of stimulus, \n     of course, should already be on the way from the huge and \n     growing deficit the government is now running. I have no \n     strong views on whether more action on this front is \n     warranted. But if it is, don't cut the taxes of people with \n     huge portfolios of stocks held directly. (Small investors \n     owning stock held through 401(k)s are already tax-favored.) \n     Instead, give reductions to those who both need and will \n     spend the money gained. Enact a Social Security tax \n     ``holiday'' or give a flat-sum rebate to people with low \n     incomes. Putting $1,000 in the pockets of 310,000 families \n     with urgent needs is going to provide far more stimulus to \n     the economy than putting the same $310 million in my pockets.\n       When you listen to tax-cut rhetoric, remember that giving \n     one class of taxpayer a ``break'' requires--now or down the \n     line--that an equivalent burden be imposed on other parties. \n     In other words, if I get a break, someone else pays. \n     Government can't deliver a free lunch to the country as a \n     whole. It can, however, determine who pays for lunch. And \n     last week the Senate handed the bill to the wrong party.\n       Supporters of making dividends tax-free like to paint \n     critics as promoters of class warfare. The fact is, however, \n     that their proposal promotes class welfare. For my class.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. It reads:\n\n       Let me, as a member of that non-endangered species, give \n     you an example of how the scales are currently balanced.\n\n  He means with the Tax Code. Again, this is the second richest man in \nthe world.\n\n       The taxes I pay to the federal government, including the \n     payroll tax that is paid for me by my employer, Berkshire \n     Hathaway, are roughly the same proportion of my income--about \n     30 percent--as that paid by the receptionist in our office. \n     My case is not atypical--my earnings, like those of many rich \n     people, are a mix of capital gains and ordinary income--nor \n     is it affected by tax shelters (I've never used any). As it \n     works out, I pay a somewhat higher rate for my combination of \n     salary, investment and capital gains income than our \n     receptionist does. But she pays a far higher portion of her \n     income in payroll taxes than I do.\n\n  His point is that he and the receptionist pay about the same \npercentage of their income. Understand, this is the second richest man \nin the world and his receptionist in his office.\n  Then he says:\n\n       Now the Senate says that dividends should be tax-free to \n     recipients. Suppose this measure goes through and the \n     directors of Berkshire Hathaway (which does not now pay a \n     dividend) therefore decide to pay $1 billion in dividends \n     next year. Owning 31 percent of Berkshire, I would receive \n     $310 million in additional income, owe not another dime in \n     federal tax, and see my tax rate plunge to 3 percent. And our \n     receptionist? She'd still be paying the 30 percent, which \n     means she would be contributing about 10 times the proportion \n     of her income that I would to such government pursuits as \n     fighting terrorism, waging wars and supporting the elderly. \n     Let me repeat the point: Her overall federal tax rate would \n     be 10 times what my rate would be.\n\n  I read that into the Congressional Record because I thought it was a \nfascinating description by Warren Buffett, one of the richest men in \nthe world, about the issue of deciding that dividends should get \nextraordinarily preferential tax treatment. In fact, some say we should \neliminate the tax on savings and investment, therefore, exempting \ninterest, dividends, and capital gains from tax.\n  We have a lot of people who do different things. Some people work \nhard. Some people invest and clip coupons. Some people get up and \nshower in the morning. Some people work hard in difficult jobs, labor \njobs and others that require them to shower at night. Some people work \noutside. Some people work indoors. Some people have income from wages. \nSome people have income from dividends or earnings or royalties of some \ntype.\n  So the question is how should the Tax Code treat all of this? I ask \nthis question: Which is more worthy, work or investment? Or are they \nequally worthy? And if so, if work is as worthy as investment, then why \nwould one decide to treat investment income with such preferences in \nthe Tax Code? And why would one decide to tax work and exempt \ninvestment? Why would one decide to say we are going to take out this \nactivity called work and sock it with a tax, and we are going to take \nout this activity called investment and make it tax exempt? What is the \nvalue system that says let's tax work but exempt investment?\n  I think the value system, although I do not subscribe to this, is one \nthat says the most important element in this business cycle of ours, in \nthis free enterprise system, is investment.\n  Investment is very important, there is no question about that. But \nso, too, is work. Let me read something I put in the Congressional \nRecord in 1996 in the Senate. It was about a fellow who I think is a \nhero. I have only met him once. I did not know him at all at that \npoint. I read about him in the Minneapolis Tribune as I came through \nthe Minneapolis Airport one morning. His name is Robert Naegele, and \nthis relates to the point of value of work relative to value of \ninvestment.\n\n  Robert Naegele and his wife Ellis did something very extraordinary, \nsomething that surprised me when I read it in the Minneapolis Star \nTribune that morning at the Minneapolis Airport. He owned a company \ncalled Rollerblade, a very successful company, the largest company \nproducing inline skates in America, rollerblades.\n  Most people know about rollerblades. I happen to like to rollerblade. \nI enjoy rollerblading. So he owned and was chairman of this company \ncalled Rollerblade.\n  He sold the company after it was very successful, and he made an \nenormous amount of money. Just before Christmas in the year 1996, just \nafter he sold this company and made a substantial amount of money, he \ndecided he was going to return some of the profits from the sale of \nthat company to the employees who worked in that company. He did not \ntell any of the workers about it. They began opening what they thought \nwere Christmas cards from the previous owner of this company, Mr. \nNaegele and his wife.\n  It turns out it was, in fact, a Christmas card with a check. The \ncheck was computed on the basis of the number of months these people \nhad worked for the company. It was an amount of money that he wanted to \nreturn to the employees as a result of the profit he had made from \nselling this company that made rollerblades.\n\n[[Page S11467]]\n\n  The checks were as high as $20,000 to those who had worked there a \nlong period of time. He said: By the way, I have prepaid the taxes on \nthis bonus. So this is a check that is free and clear. I have paid the \ntaxes on it for you. He said: I did this because while I was very \nfortunate to run a very successful company, I understand that this \ncompany was successful because of the wonderful men and women who \nworked there. They worked in the plant. They worked in shipping. They \nworked in manufacturing. They worked in the finance area. They made \nthis company. They were this company. They helped make me successful, \nand I made a lot of money. But I want to share it with those workers.\n  I thought, what a wonderful story. What a heroic thing to do, to \nfinally recognize something that has been so lost in this country in \nrecent years: the value and the worth of the workers who perform the \nwork, who make these companies.\n  These days, employees are too often treated like a wrench: Use it, \nuse it up, throw it away; it is just another tool. Mr. Naegele \nunderstood an employee is not just another tool. An employee is a part \nof the personality and productivity of that company. The work is as \nimportant as the investment. It is workers and management. It is \nworkers and investors. All of it together makes a company and makes a \ncompany successful. Very seldom do you see that ethic exist these days \nin how people look at these companies. But I put something in the \nSenate Record on January 10, 1996, paying tribute to this fellow.\n  I tell that story today because it describes the value of work and \nthe understanding of what work contributes to this country, to the \ninnovation of its business community, and to the capability of what \nAmerica can offer its employees in the free enterprise system.\n  The question of how we tax is very important. We must build roads, we \nmust provide for our country's common defense, we must build schools \nand educate children, we must provide health care to those who cannot \nprovide for themselves--there are things we must do. So we must pay a \ntax.\n  The question of how we impose that tax burden on the American people \nis very important. And this ethic, somehow this notion, this value \nsystem that says, oh, by the way, let's tax work and exempt investment, \nis one that I think relates directly to values.\n  What is the value system that tells us work is less worthy than other \nenterprises? Work is not less worthy than other enterprises. It is an \nimportant part of what has helped build this country.\n  I do not diminish at all entrepreneurs and investors. They are an \nimportant part of this. But so, too, is the important labor force in \nthis country.\n  I taught economics for a brief period in college. Samuelson, Econ. \n101, you teach the streams of income and what generates the streams of \nincome. You teach the business cycle--all of these issues. Nothing has \nreally changed very much over the years except there is a change with \nrespect to those who want to create a new reality here, suggesting that \nsomehow there is one element of this system of capitalism that is so \nmuch more important than the others. I do not believe that is the case. \nI believe all of this fits together like the picture of a puzzle. A \nsignificant part of America's progress has been the worker and the \nethic of work and the value of work.\n  We will work together to overhaul this country's tax system. But I \nwill not be a part of a system that says let's decide to impose a \nburden on the receptionist in the office that is 10 times the burden we \nwill impose on the world's second richest man. That is not a value \nsystem that makes sense to me.\n  Oh, some will come here and say: But we have to do that to \nincentivize growth. That doesn't incentivize growth. That retards \nfairness, but it doesn't incentivize growth.\n  We have a lot to do to fix this tax system of ours. I proposed in the \npast and will again a way with respect to the current income tax system \nto remove the burden of some 70 to 80 million Americans from even \nhaving to file a tax return. We don't need to have the streets clogged \non April 15 for people to get to the post office to get their tax \nreturns postmarked. We can and should dramatically simplify this tax \nsystem. But we should not take a giant step in the direction of \ndeciding there are some who will pay a substantial amount more than \nothers, in reverse order here, with the highest amounts being paid by \nthose who are least able to afford it, and the lowest amounts being \npaid by those who are most able to afford it.\n  We are blessed to be a part of this great country. We could have been \nborn anywhere. We could live anywhere. We share this planet with 6 \nbillion people and, through God's grace, somehow we ended up here. \nThere is not another place like it. It is our job to take what we have \ninherited and make it better.\n  They say we inherit this from our folks and borrow it from our \nchildren. This great democracy of ours, including the progress over two \ncenturies now that I am very proud of, requires nurturing and constant \nattention. Yes, one of the controversial and difficult areas has always \nbeen, How do you raise the revenue to do that which is necessary in our \nGovernment?\n  We can debate about how large government should or should not be. My \ncolleague from Oklahoma will follow me today. He is working, probably \ntoday--I suspect almost every day for months and months, on this \nquestion of, How do we construct a new highway program? What amount of \nmoney is necessary? With what formula shall it be distributed? That is \nreally important work. That is an investment in the infrastructure of \nthis country that is very important.\n  When he and others get a bill that we can finally get to the floor \nand create, I hope a 6-year program--then we have to figure out how we \npay for that just as we have to pay for everything else. The question \nisn't whether there should be a tax system. There is a system by which \nwe collect taxes. The question is how should that system be constructed \nso that it is fair to all Americans.\n  I look forward to a debate this coming year in which we talk about \ntax reform and changing our tax system because I think this is a system \nthat is ripe for change. But it is critically important that we have a \ndiscussion about the tax burden and what is fair.\n  The President announced today he is going to have a commission, which \nis a good thing. I hope that all viewpoints will be involved in that \ncommission. You can get a commission to propose almost anything here in \nthis town. I saw a few of the names on that commission, and I certainly \nthink it needs some more energy and some more thought from other points \non the compass.\n\n  But I would say to the President, I think the Congress will welcome a \ndebate about overhauling the Tax Code. But if it is proposed that we \ndecide, for example, that dividends, interest and capital gains income \nshall be eliminated from the tax rolls, we will welcome that debate \nwith a very aggressive discussion about what is the value of work and \nwhy should we diminish the value of work.\n  I indicated earlier today about the ``good enough'' description, by \nMa Ferguson, the former Governor of Texas. I will not recall that story \nagain, but if a 5.25-percent tax rate is good enough for companies who \nmove their jobs overseas, why is it not good enough for all Americans? \nIf a zero-percent tax rate is good enough for those earning dividends, \nwhy is it not good enough for the wages of workers.\n  Let me just show you, if you exempt investment income from taxation, \nthe top 10 percent get most of the benefit--$463 billion in realized \ndividend, capital gain and interest income. The bottom 90 percent have \nfar less.\n  So you see, if you eliminate dividends, for example, from taxation, a \nmassive amount of the tax breaks goes to the same old corner that it \nalways goes, those who have the most.\n  Bob Wills and his Texas Playboys used to have a line in their 1930s \nsong:\n\n     The little bee sucks the blossom\n     And the big bee gets the honey.\n     The little guy picks the cotton\n     And the big guy makes the money.\n\n  Every time we focus on tax reform we find the same thing, especially \nin recent years.\n  Let me again say I am all for changing our Tax Code in ways that are \nthoughtful. We ought to simplify it. But we ought to resist efforts \nthat will make it more unfair and strive to move\n\n[[Page S11468]]\n\ntowards efforts that will make the burden fair to all Americans. That \nhas certainly not been the case in recent years. My hope is when we \nnext see a proposal dealing with America's Tax Code that we will see \nsomething that represents some semblance of fairness. Otherwise there \nis likely to be a debate breaking out in the Senate, which would be a \nvery healthy thing, in my judgment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I have a number of things to address. I \nhave been listening with great interest to my very good friend from \nNorth Dakota. I bow to his superior knowledge in economics. I was not \naware that he was a professor of economics, or taught economics. They \nsay confession is good for the soul. I will say to my friend from North \nDakota, I went to nine different colleges and universities, all of them \nnight school where I was stationed when I was in the military. I \nremember once I got out I backed a truck up to the University of Tulsa \nand shoved off all my transcripts, and they looked at it and said: You \nare an economist. So that is where I got my background in economics.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator will yield for a moment, I would say I was \nactually not a professor. I did teach economics at the college briefly, \nbut I was able to overcome that experience.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Well, good.\n  I would like to make a couple of comments. That is not what I am here \nto talk about today. But this President has a commitment to do \nsomething about our tax system. I know there is a lot of class warfare \nthat goes on and people are always talking about taxes and that the \npoor people are paying all the taxes. It is kind of interesting that \nthis President wants to make a dramatic change in the tax structure. \nWhen I go back to my State of Oklahoma, no matter where I go the people \nare all united in saying they really want to have something different.\n  The interesting thing is, I was riding yesterday with a CPA from \nOklahoma and said: If we are successful in dramatically simplifying the \nTax Code, why would you support that because you might be out of work?\n  He said: I would gladly do it. I can always find something else. It \nis unfair and it is a system that needs to be cleaned up.\n  I would only caution people who are watching what is going on in this \nChamber, when we get into a discussion of changing the Tax Code, every \ntime there is someone who suggests that you lower the marginal rates of \ntaxation, they assume that this is an unjust burden on the lower income \npeople.\n  In fact, when this President did it he was lowering the tax rate on \npeople who paid taxes. Obviously, if you don't pay taxes, you can't \nlower the rate. That is what he was faced with.\n  Also, we learned a lesson following World War I when they raised \ntaxes. It brought a lot of revenue into the system to fight World War \nI. When it was over, they decided they would go ahead and reduce the \ntaxes because they did not need the revenue anymore. They were shocked \nto find out when they reduced the taxes that the revenue increased.\n  Then again, a very smart President, one I admired very much, was the \nPresident of the United States by the name of Kennedy. When President \nKennedy was in office we were expanding a lot of the things in the \nsocial programs in this country. He said we have to have more money, \nand we have to raise more revenue to take care of these programs. John \nKennedy was a Democrat, not a Republican. He said the best way to raise \nrevenue was to reduce marginal rates. So he reduced marginal rates, and \nsure enough, that opened it up and revenue increased.\n  Another person came in the White House, Ronald Reagan, in 1980. He \nsaid the same thing. He actually reduced the top bracket rate from some \n95 percent down to about 25 percent; and all other brackets, too. \nEverybody got in on that good deal. The largest tax reduction in the \nhistory of America successfully reduced taxes and increased revenue.\n  The evidence of that, if you look at the total revenue that came from \nmarginal rates in the 1980s, was $244 billion. In 1990, it was $466 \nbillion. It almost doubled in that decade, that 10-year period. It was \nthe largest reduction of taxes in this Nation's history.\n  I hope those who will be engaging in class warfare and are going to \nbe talking about how this is unfair and how the rich need to be paying \nmore taxes keep in mind that the people who are paying the taxes are \nmiddle-income Americans. These are the people who need the relief. They \nneed to have more opportunities to do more with the money. That is how \nyou increase revenues.\n  I hear a lot of people complaining about this President and the fact \nwe have the deficit. Obviously, we have the deficit for three reasons.\n  No. 1, we had a recession. This President inherited a recession. That \nstarted in March of 2000. With the economic activity low, you have to \nuse the formula that for each 1-percent increase in economic activity \nit produces $46 billion in new revenue. So it was way down.\n  No. 2, he had succeeded President Clinton where he had cut the \ndefense spending down to the bone with the myth floating around that \nsomehow the cold war was over; we didn't need a military anymore. We \nwere down to about half the Army divisions, down in tactical airwings, \nand half in ships, down 300 from 600. Then we realized we were in a \nmore hostile world. By the time President George W. Bush had to start \nrebuilding the military, our modernization programs had stopped.\n  Then 9/11 came along. Here we are in a war.\n  I can tell you that the three factors which caused the deficit are \nfactors that we are overcoming as we are speaking. But you might as \nwell hold your breath for a while because the war is going to last a \nwhile.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/18/senate-section/article/S11468-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11468-S11469]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTES TO RETIRING SENATORS\n\n\n                              Don Nickles\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I am so pleased that I have a chance a say \na few good words about my colleague, Don Nickles. It is hard to talk \nabout Don Nickles. I remember him when he was in the State senate. I \nbelieve Don Nickles at that time was the president of the College \nRepublicans in Oklahoma. I remember going to Ponca City and giving a \nspeech at his invitation. Afterwards, he showed just an incredible \ninterest in politics. This was back in the 1970s. He ran for State \nsenate. I believe it was in 1978. And he won.\n  Midway through that term, in 1980, a seat opened and he decided he \nwas going to run for the U.S. Senate. Everybody laughed. Who is this \nkid, anyway? He was about 30 years old. He still looks like he is about \n35 years old. At that time he looked like he was about 18 years old.\n  He ran and defeated some of the real heavyweights in the State. Then \nhe came and served in the Senate.\n  I understand that in those early years they wouldn't let him ride the \nMembers' elevators because they didn't believe he was a Member. They \nthought he was a page.\n  Nonetheless, Don Nickles started proving himself. I watched him \nmature in this job. As the years went by, every time a 6-year period \nended, he would talk about dropping out. But we talked him into \nrunning.\n  Finally, he decided he needed to do something else with his life and \ndo what is in the best interests of his family.\n  But he grew with the ability to offer expertise that I haven't seen \nin the Senate since I have been here, and I have been here for 10 \nyears. I have watched Don Nickles as he matured, as he gained knowledge \nin areas and expertise in not just one isolated area but in all areas. \nWhen he stands up to talk, everybody is quiet. They want to listen to \nhim because they know he knows what he is talking about.\n  I can recall when Elizabeth Dole was first elected. We were making a \ntribute to Don Nickles about 3 months after she was here. She said: I \nhave watched him talk about the budget. I have watched him talk about \nhow you finance Government. I have watched him go through all these \nvery difficult things, and I have been here 3 months and I have to \nconfess I don't even know what he is talking about. I said: Elizabeth, \ndon't feel bad. I have been here 10 years and I still don't know what \nhe is talking about.\n\n[[Page S11469]]\n\n  Don Nickles developed that level of expertise that other people do \nnot. It is because he studies. He works.\n  He is going to be sorely missed by a lot of people around here \nbecause of what he had to offer and because of the contributions he has \nmade.\n  I am 15 years older than Don Nickles. I have been his junior Senator. \nI guess it is now time I become senior Senator.\n  I will miss his expertise, his charm, his humor, and most of all I \nwill miss him because he is my brother. I will miss him dearly. Don, it \nis going to be goodbye to you but hang around. We look forward to \nworking with you and accepting your advice because I know it will be \nthere when we need it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor Marine LCpl. Joseph \nL. Nice from Nicoma Park, OK, who made the ultimate sacrifice for his \ncountry on August 4, 2004. This fourth-generation soldier died \ndefending the freedom he enjoyed and fighting to ensure it for others.\n  Lance Corporal Nice moved to Nicoma Park, OK from Newark, NJ, in \n1998. He was a gifted young man--a musician, artist and sportsman, who \nused these gifts in the marching band and on the soccer team at Choctaw \nHigh School. From the age of 5, he had longed to follow in the \nfootsteps of his father, his grandfathers, and his uncle in serving in \nthe military. After weighing this tradition and putting on hold his \nplans to study law, Joseph Nice decided to join the Marine Corps in \nJune 2003.\n  Lance Corporal Nice was assigned to 3rd Battalion, 7th Marines, 1st \nMarine Division, I Marine Expeditionary Force stationed at Marine Corps \nAir Ground Combat Center at Twentynine Palms, CA. His unit was deployed \nto Iraq in February 2004, where Lance Corporal Nice and his fellow \nMarines faced daily attacks in the Anbar province. During one of these \nattacks on August 4, 2004, Joseph Nice was killed.\n  I represent the State of Oklahoma in paying my condolences to the \nfamily of this American hero. A friend of his said about him: ``If you \nhad a problem, he was always there for you.'' Through his service in \nIraq, LCpl Joseph Nice demonstrated his worthiness to receive this \nhighest compliment. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and \nfriends today.\n\n\n                       army spc. sonny g. sampler\n\n  Mr. President, we also pay homage to Army SPC Sonny G. Sampler from \nOklahoma City, OK, who died in the name of freedom in Iraq on 8 July \n2004. He moved to Oklahoma City from Altus, OK and began attending John \nMarshall High School.\n  Specialist Sampler saw the Army as an opportunity for focus and \ndirection and joined in 2001. He was deployed to Iraq with 1st \nBattalion, 26th Infantry Regiment, 1st Infantry Division based in \nSchweinfurt, Germany. In serving his country, Sonny Sampler did not shy \naway from his other duties. In the words of Maj. Gen. Douglas Dollar, \n``This young man was willing to go to a strange land and fight for \npeople he didn't know.'' It is the same young man who sold some \nbelongings to pay for a flight from Germany back to the United States \nat Christmas to surprise his mother. Such a family man is to be much \nvalued.\n  Specialist Sampler was tragically killed when he was searching the \nIraqi National Guard Headquarters for survivors, following an allied \nattack. When the ruins underwent an attack by insurgents, Sonny Sampler \nand five other U.S. soldiers died. He was 23 years old.\n  Our thoughts and prayers are with this American hero's family and \nfriends at this very difficult time. We should never cease to be proud \nof this man.\n\n\n                         SGT DANIEL LEE GALVAN\n\n  Mr. President, we also pay homage to Sgt Daniel Lee Galvan, who \njoined the Army to realize his childhood dream of working with \nhelicopters. Earlier this year, Sergeant Galvan made the ultimate \nsacrifice for his country--his life. Sergeant Galvan was a dedicated \ndefender of America who followed his father into the military. For this \nservice and his sacrifice, I am proud to honor him in the Senate today.\n  Daniel Galvan was born in Fort Ord, CA, but later moved to Moore, OK, \nwhere he joined the Army reserve after high school but enlisted in 1996 \nto fulfill what he saw as his calling to be a soldier. Though he knew a \ncareer in the military would enable him to provide for his family, the \npaycheck was never his primary motivation. In the words of his wife, \nSonya, ``He joined because he believed in the cause. He believed in the \nmilitary. And he was proud to wear the uniform and honored to be an \nAmerican.'' Sergeant Galvan was a helicopter crew chief with the 2nd \nBattalion (Assault), 25th Aviation Regiment, 25th Infantry Division \n(Light), based out of Schofield Barracks in Hawaii.\n  On August 12, 2004, the Black Hawk helicopter that was transporting \nSergeant Galvan and fourteen other soldiers in Afghanistan developed \nmechanical problems and crashed near the Pakistani border. The fourteen \nothers were wounded, but Daniel Lee Galvan, an honorable Oklahoman and \nexample for us all, paid the ultimate price. Sergeant Galvan left \nbehind his wife as well as two children, his daughter Audrey, 13, and \nhis son Joseph, 11. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family for \nthe loss of such a special man.\n  On behalf of the U.S. Senate, I ask that we pay tribute to Sergeant \nGalvan and the men and women like him, who know the true meaning of \nservice and sacrifice. These men and women have tasted freedom, and \nwish to ensure that freedom for those who have never experienced it. I \nhonor the memory of our sons and daughters who have died for this noble \ncause, and especially the memory of Oklahoma's son, Daniel Lee Galvan.\n\n\n                        cpl nathaniel t. hammond\n\n  Mr. President, I rise to honor the memory of a brave young American \nwho gave his life defending the Nation. He felt a call to serve his \ncountry, to be part of something bigger than himself, and for that call \nhe paid the highest price.\n  Cpl Nathaniel T. Hammond was assigned to the Marine Reserves' 2nd \nBattalion, 24th Marine Regiment, 4th Marine Division in Chicago. Nathan \nwasn't a native Oklahoman--he was born and raised in Brighton, MO, \nwhere he graduated from high school in 1998 and then joined the \nMarines, but he lived in Tulsa and had trained with the Anti-Tank \nTraining Company, a Marine Reserve unit, in Broken Arrow.\n  On November 8 in Babil province, Iraq, he was killed in an insurgent \nattack. He gave his life for the freedom of millions of Americans, and \nalso for the peace and prosperity of the Iraqi people only now \nbeginning to recover from decades under a totalitarian regime.\n  Corporal Hammond had a long-held desire to serve the military as a \nmember of the Special Forces, but even as a member of the Marine \nReserve, he was ``doing what he wanted to do and what the loved to \ndo,'' according to a childhood friend and fellow soldier. His parents \nhave described how Nathan evinced the selfless attitude toward service \nto country that is so evident in all our military men and women.\n  We are all glad Nathan Hammond was willing to serve. His loss is \ngrievous to all of us. Our thoughts are with his parents and the rest \nof his family back in Missouri. At the same time, we recognize his \nvalor and commitment. It is for men like Nathan Hammond that I am proud \nto be a part of this great country. He was a special soldier, a true \nOklahoman, and a true American.\n\n\n                        pfc nachez washalanta ii\n\n  Mr. President, I honor the memory of a courageous young Oklahoman who \ndied while defending his Nation. Marine PFC Nachez Washalanta II grew \nup in the great State of Oklahoma, went to school in Ardmore and Silo, \nand joined the Marines in April 2002.\n  The road wasn't always smooth for Wash, as his fellow Marines called \nhim. He grew up in a foster home with four other boys, and got his GED \ninstead of graduating from high school. Eventually, Private Washalanta \nfound a home with the United States Marine Corps. He was the driver of \na light-armored\n\n[[Page S11470]]\n\nvehicle, and although he sometimes complained that he joined the \nMarines to fight and not to drive, he got his chance in Iraq.\n\n  Private Washlanta was a member of the 1st Light-Armored \nReconnaissance Battalion, 1st Marine Division, I Marine Expeditionary \nForce from Camp Pendleton, CA. He paid the ultimate price. When you \nthink about these five great Oklahomans, as well as others around the \ncountry, and some 1,100 who have lost their lives, it is a shame that \nso many people in America do not understand what these soldiers \nunderstand.\n  Mr. President, I have the honor of being, I guess, the second or \nthird ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. \nConsequently, I may have made more trips over to Iraq and Afghanistan \nthan anyone else. I am always approached by these young people. They \nsay: Why is it, Senator, that the people back home don't appreciate \nwhat we are doing? These people are dedicated, and they know exactly \nwhat they are doing. Unfortunately, we have a media that tries to \ndemean everything they are doing. And I give the assurance to these \nyoung people that even though it might be that the networks, CNN, and \nthe New York Times and the Washington Post do not know and appreciate \nwhat they are doing, we do, the real people of America. And they are \nheroes.\n  I think most of our young people realize our country is facing the \ngreatest risk it has ever faced. This is not conventional warfare. This \nis not something that is predictable. Sometimes I say I look back \nwistfully at the days of the Cold War where we had two superpowers, and \nthey were predictable. We were predictable, they were predictable. This \nis totally unpredictable, but it is a war that has to be won. I pay \nhomage not just to those Oklahomans I mentioned today, but all who are \nthere and many who have paid the ultimate price for our freedom right \nhere in this country.\n\n\n                         Sgt Morgan W. Strader\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart and deep \nsense of gratitude to honor the life of a brave young man from \nBrownsburg, IN. Sgt Morgan W. Strader, 23 years old, died on November \n12. After completing his enlistment, Morgan voluntarily extended his \nservice, choosing to accompany his unit back to Iraq--a selfless choice \nthat would cost him his life. Morgan was shot while conducting combat \noperations in the Al Anbar Province of Iraq. With his entire life \nbefore him, Morgan risked everything to fight for the values Americans \nhold close to our hearts, in a land halfway around the world.\n  Before moving to Crossville, TN, Morgan attended school in \nBrownsburg. Morgan graduated from high school and followed in his \ngrandfather's footsteps by joining the military. Morgan's father, Gary, \ntold the Indianapolis Star that ``He was a Marine from the day that he \nwas born . . . His grandfather was in the Army during Korea. He latched \nonto that and loved it.'' It was clear that from a young age, Morgan \nfelt compelled to serve his country in the Armed Forces, just as his \ngrandfather had done.\n  Morgan was the thirty-seventh Hoosier soldier to be killed while \nserving his country in Operation Iraqi Freedom. He was assigned to the \nKilo Company, 3rd Battalion, 1st Marines, Regimental Combat Team-1, 1st \nMarine Division, Camp Pendleton, CA. This brave young soldier leaves \nbehind his father and stepmother, Gary and Janet; his mother and \nstepfather, Linda and Timothy; his grandparents, Onza and Estelle \nMorgan; his grandfather, William Strader; his sisters, Amber, Jessica \nand Rachel; and his brothers, Brian, Chris and Matthew.\n  Today, I join Morgan's family, his friends and the entire Hoosier \ncommunity in mourning his death. While we struggle to bear our sorrow \nover this loss, we can also take pride in the example he set, bravely \nfighting to make the world a safer place. It is his courage and \nstrength of character that people will remember when they think of \nMorgan, a memory that will burn brightly during these continuing days \nof conflict and grief.\n  Morgan was known for his dedication to family and his love of \ncountry. When looking back on Morgan's life, his father, Gary, recalled \nto the Indianapolis Star a conversation that he had with his son \nshortly before his departure for a second tour in Iraq. Gary was trying \nto convince his son that he had done his part and his service was \ncomplete. Morgan told his father upon deciding to reenlist, `` Dad, the \nguys in my unit aren't experienced in this . . . I need to help them.'' \nMorgan died in the same fashion in which he had lived by putting the \nwell-being of others before his own. Today and always, Morgan will be \nremembered by family members, friends and fellow Hoosiers as a true \nAmerican hero and we honor the sacrifice he made while dutifully \nserving his country.\n  As I search for words to do justice in honoring Morgan's sacrifice, I \nam reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the families \nof the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: ``We cannot dedicate, we cannot \nconsecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and \ndead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power \nto add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we \nsay here, but it can never forget what they did here.'' This statement \nis just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, as I am certain \nthat the impact of Morgan's actions will live on far longer than any \nrecord of these words.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Morgan W. Strader in the \nofficial record of the U.S. Senate for his service to this country and \nfor his profound commitment to freedom, democracy and peace. When I \nthink about this just cause in which we are engaged, and the \nunfortunate pain that comes with the loss of our heroes, I hope that \nfamilies like Morgan's can find comfort in the words of the prophet \nIsaiah who said, ``He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord \nGod will wipe away tears from off all faces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be \nwith all of you, as I know He is with Morgan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/18/senate-section/article/S11470-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11470-S11472]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                FAREWELL\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President and colleagues, the last time anyone does \nanything in their career or in their life, I think it is a time for a \ncertain degree of sadness and a certain degree of nostalgic remembrance \nof the times past. This evening will probably be my last opportunity to \naddress this body as a Member, as a Member of the Senate, representing \nmy great and wonderful State of Louisiana.\n  While some would say, well, it has to be a very difficult time to \nspeak for the last time on the floor of the Senate, looking back at all \nthe great memories, I look back with nothing but great pleasure over \nthe many years I have spent in the Senate as well as in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  I have been very honored to serve and be elected seven times to the \nother body, serving 14 years as a Member of the House, representing \nsouthwest Louisiana--it was a great and wonderful time--and then moving \non to the Senate 18 years ago, representing the entire State of \nLouisiana.\n  So when you look back over those years, I think a lot of people would \nsay: Well, it is your last speech, and it must be a very nostalgic \ntime, and you really are sad. I am not. I am pleased. I am happy. I am \noverwhelmed with the opportunity that was presented to me for those 32 \nyears in the Congress to serve the people of Louisiana in one capacity \nor another, both in the House, as well as in this Chamber.\n  Thirty-five years ago, I, with my wife, came to Washington for the \nvery first time as a young staff person, legislative assistant, having \njust gotten out of law school. I worked in the Seventh Congressional \nDistrict office for then-Congressman Edwin Edwards. It was a great \nlearning period for me.\n  Shortly after serving as a staff person, there was a vacancy that was \ncreated, and I ran for that vacancy as a young 28-year-old member of \nthe Bar Association in my State. I ran for Congress and had a slogan I \nremember back then, when I was 28, when I was running for Congress for \nthe first time. My slogan was: ``Experience makes the difference.''\n  Most of the people I was running against were old enough to be my \ngrandfather or grandparent, certainly old enough to be my parent. Yet I \nhad the audacity to print the slogan on a bumper sticker that \n``Experience makes the difference.''\n\n[[Page S11471]]\n\n  Of course, it aggravated the heck out of all the people I was running \nagainst because they said: How dare someone 28 years old talk about \nexperience making the difference; He has none.\n  Well, I was the only person running who ever worked in a \ncongressional office in Washington. I was the only person who had ever \nrun a congressional office in the district. And I was the only lawyer \nwho was running. I told the people in that first race that we were \nelecting someone to go to Washington and make laws, and I was the only \nlawyer running. Therefore, they should vote for me.\n  That went over fairly well for a period of time until all of my \nopponents realized 98 percent of the people were not lawyers, and about \n100 percent of them hated lawyers. So as soon as they started \narticulating that different viewpoint on the function of lawyers, I \nstarted going down in the polls, and thank goodness the election was \nonly a couple weeks later.\n\n  To make a long story short, we were elected back in 1972 and came to \nWashington. I came with my wife Lois and two very small children, John, \nJr., and Bill Breaux. I remember we had to rent a U-Haul truck to come \nto Washington. I had never had an opportunity to be up here. We came \nup, and I will always remember this: When we left Louisiana, my two \nsons did not want to go. My youngest son, the night before we left, \nwhen he was saying his prayers, said: Goodbye, God. We are moving to \nWashington.\n  My oldest son, who was about 4 or 5 at the time, ran away to a \nneighbor's house and crawled under the house. In Louisiana, the houses \nare built off the ground. He ran under the house and would not come \nout. And we had my mom Katie, my dad Ezra, my father-in-law Lloyd, and \nmy mother-in-law Doris who were all there watching us get into the U-\nHaul to go to Washington, and I had to crawl under the house and \nliterally drag John, Jr., out from under the house and make him get \ninto the U-Haul truck so we could move to Washington. I finally got him \nhere.\n  We came to Washington. I will always remember we came here on a \nSaturday. I wanted to go to see the Capitol because I knew it was going \nto be such an impressive place. I remember that night the Marine Corps \nBand was playing, how they do in the springtime. They have concerts. \nThey used to do that on the front steps. And they were having a \nconcert. I thought they were playing the concert for me.\n  We were so delighted as a family to be able to see our first \nimpressions of the U.S. Capitol, with the playing of the band on a \nwonderful evening. It was a great memory then, and it is still a great \nmemory 35 years later.\n  In those days when I was in the House, we had an arrangement, if you \nwill. In those days when I arrived here, Carl Albert was Speaker of the \nHouse. And then Tip O'Neill became the Democratic leader and Speaker of \nthe House, and Bob Michel was the Republican leader. And Tip O'Neill \nand Bob Michel probably differed as much as any two people you could \npossibly know in terms of philosophy in how Government should work. Tip \nO'Neill was an FDR liberal Democrat from Massachusetts, and Bob Michel \nwas from Peoria, IL, a middle America Republican. They did not agree on \nhow Government should work necessarily from a philosophical standpoint, \nbut they knew how to make Government work.\n  They spoke more in one day back then than some of the leaders later \non spoke in a year because the House changed to a position where now \nmany times leaders do not speak to each other. I would suggest that \ngovernment was not any worse off when you had a Tip O'Neill and a Bob \nMichel traveling together, playing golf together, drinking in the \nevening and having a cocktail together, playing golf together, betting \non sporting events together, which I know they did because they had a \nrelationship that allowed them to find out, What do we have to do to \naccomplish what we both realize is best for this country? They were \nable to do that in a way that I thought was incredibly effective.\n  Hale Boggs swore me in to the House of Representatives, a truly great \nmajority leader. I learned a great deal from him and had a great deal \nof respect for everything he taught me and taught so many.\n  That was back then. My two sons, who were crawling and saying their \nprayers before bed, are both 38 years of age. My oldest daughter, Beth, \nis 34 and is married to a wonderful person named Jeff Shepardson; and \nnow we have three beautiful grandchildren, Anna Kate, Campbell, and \nC.J. Shepardson, age 2. Also, my youngest daughter, Julie, is now 28.\n  So after you have been here a while, you wake up one day and say \nwhere has all the time gone and how fast it went. I think about that \noften, but I also think about all of the wonderful things I have been \nprivileged to witness, watch, and participate in, in those 32 years in \nCongress. It has been a real privilege and pleasure. I have had the \nhonor of serving with three great Senators, including Russell Long, \nwhen he was the senior Senator from Louisiana and I was a House Member. \nI remember coming over to see Russell when I first got into the House \nof Representatives. I wanted to come and pay my respects. I had been in \nCongress about a week. So I came over to the Senate and walked up in \nthe Senate office building to see Russell Long. I remember getting on \nthe elevator and it went up to the second floor. The door opened and \nSenator Jim Eastland from Mississippi got on. He looked at me--and I \nwas on the Members elevator, which shows you the audacity I had even \nthen. He looked at me and said, ``Hey, boy, what are you doing here?'' \nI said, ``I am a Congressman and I am going to see Russell Long.'' He \nsaid, ``You're not a Congressman.'' I said, ``Yes, sir, I am.'' He \nlooked at me and walked off the elevator. Those Members are so \nwonderful to look back on, and it is interesting to see how things have \ndeveloped.\n  I learned a great deal from Russell Long. He taught me how to work \nwith people. He could get more done in the evening over a bottle of \nbourbon than we can get done by having months and months of hearings \nand hours of debate because he knew how to bring people together. He \nhad an incredibly great personality and sense of history of where he \ncame from. And he learned from his father who also served in this body.\n  I also served with Bennett Johnston, a great person who could work \nboth sides of the aisle. He became chairman of the Energy Committee and \nsenior member of the Appropriations Committee. Bennett was outstanding. \nIt was interesting because we never had a cross word politically. A lot \nof Members, I think, have natural competition between Members of the \nsame State, particularly if they are in different parties. I have had \nthe fortune to serve only with members of the Democratic Party in the \nSenate. Bennett and I had a wonderful working relationship. He would \ntake the lead on some things, and I would try to take the lead on \nothers. It was a wonderful relationship.\n  In the last several years, it has been Mary Landrieu, who I have seen \ndevelop into one of the greatest politicians and greatest leaders of \nour State. She comes from a great tradition, a long tradition of \noutstanding public servants in the State of Louisiana, particularly in \nthe city of New Orleans. She learned from the masters, and the masters \nwere her parents, brothers and sisters. They were all involved and they \ndo a wonderful job in representing our State in so many different \ncapacities.\n  So I have had a wonderful opportunity to serve with people from my \nState who have been friends and outstanding colleagues, along with all \nof the other folks that we have had the opportunity to serve with. I \nhave looked at meeting people in Congress not just as colleagues who \nwere elected to public office, but I looked at each one of them as a \npotential friend. I learned a long time ago that you have to understand \nwhere people come from to appreciate what they are all about. I think \nmany times we take a position automatically that we don't like someone \nbecause of where they are from or what party they are in, without \ndelving into their backgrounds, why they say what they say, and who \nhelps develop those ideas.\n\n  I remember when I was in the House, I served on the Public Works \nCommittee with Bella Abzug, who many thought was the most liberal \nperson in the Congress. I remember Bella Abzug telling me, you know, \nwhere I come from, in my congressional district, they think I am too \nconservative. She\n\n[[Page S11472]]\n\nhad the type of district that encouraged her and helped her and pushed \nher to represent the people as they wanted to be represented in the \nCongress of the United States. So if you understand where people come \nfrom and understand their background and who they represent, I think it \nhelps you understand how people of different positions can be friends, \nbecause they are truly trying to represent their States the best they \ncan. It is not just because of their politics but because of where they \nare from.\n  Let me say one other thing that I think we need to pay attention to \nin this body, the Senate. That is, we should not let outside forces \ndictate to us how we treat each other and how we work together. Many \ntimes, when Democrats have a caucus lunch on Tuesday right outside this \nChamber, Republicans are having theirs separate from us at the same \ntime. Many times, we hear people call in from the outside who are in \npublic relations, PR men and women and pollsters, who spend an \ninordinate amount of time telling us how we can take actions that will \nshow how the other side is wrong and we are right. Right across the \nhall, the Republicans are hearing some of the same type of public \nrelation firms arguing to them how they can posture themselves to be \nable to blame the Democrats for failure.\n  Back in the old days, we used to do all this together. People would \nstand up and give their position, and the other side would give theirs \nand find out we are trying to accomplish the same thing, coming at it \nfrom slightly different venues and in a slightly different direction. I \nalways feel that if you only listen to yourself, you are only going to \nhear an echo and you are never going to disagree. That is why it is so \nimportant to hear the other side, listen to what the other side has to \nsay, understand what they say. You don't have to agree with them, but I \nthink you are a better person if you understand and your position \nbecomes stronger if you know what the other side is going to argue. It \nmakes your position better and stronger.\n  But you also must realize that neither party has a monopoly on the \ntruth. Both sides have good ideas. The real answer to this body and the \nHouse, and for democracies everywhere, is trying to take the best of \nwhat both sides can offer and blend them in a package that simply makes \nGovernment work for all of us. People back home are not so much \nconcerned about who wins and loses as they are about whether we are \ngetting the job done. Congress does not have to be like a Super Bowl. \nIn the Super Bowl, you have to have one team that is going to win and \none that will lose. If there is a tie, they have a playoff and go into \novertime until one team wins and one team loses. There is nothing wrong \nwith the Congress trying to find ways to reach agreement and blending \nthe best from both sides and coming up with something so that everybody \nwins. Then we can argue and fight over which team won. That way, I can \ngo back to Louisiana and tell them look what I did, and somebody from \nTexas or Illinois can go back to their State and say look what I did. \nAnd that is fine, because we can argue about success and not debate \nover failure and whose fault it was. The American people would be \nbetter served if the debate here could be a debate about how we \naccomplish something as opposed to why we didn't get anything done.\n\n  I leave with a great deal of appreciation for everybody who helped \nme, including my staff, many of whom are in the gallery. They helped me \nevery day over and above the call of duty. I also thank the people on \nthe floor with me, including Diana Bostic and so many of the friends we \nhave worked with, like Lula, who was with Senator Long before, and all \nof the other people. This has been a joint venture, to say the least. I \nleave with a great deal of optimism.\n  I am not leaving because I am unhappy or because I am mad. I have \nenjoyed every single minute of it. I have to admit that some minutes I \nhave enjoyed more than others, but by and large it has been a great and \nwonderful experience. I give nothing but the very best to my colleagues \nand wish them nothing but the very best in the future.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/18/senate-section/article/S11472-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11472-S11477]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTES TO RETIRING SENATORS\n\n\n                              John Breaux\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am fortunate enough to have been here to \nhear my colleague from Louisiana give his farewell speech. It was my \ngood fortune to have served with him both in the House and in the \nSenate. He is one of the favorites of both sides of the aisle. It is an \namazing tribute to John and his political career that he does have so \nmany friends in the Senate. From the liberal wing to the conservative \nwing, Republicans, Democrats, North, South, East and West, you like \nJohn Breaux. You like him because he is a genuine person and also \nbecause he comes from a State that is a lot of fun and he is a lot of \nfun. Some of my best memories of John are his hard work here and then \nhis hard play at home.\n  When he would invite us to New Orleans for a Democratic leadership \nconference and other meetings and show us his major city in his home \nState, it was always a treat.\n  Then occasionally he would export a little bit of Louisiana to \nWashington and to the site of the Democratic Convention, and it was \nalways a sellout event. People wanted to be there. John never let them \ndown. I saw him at the Los Angeles Convention where he gave a little \nparty--and I use that term advisedly. It was not little at all, it was \na big party. He was dressed in a costume for Mardis Gras that would \nhave put Elvis Presley to shame. It was an amazing array of gold and \nsequins, the likes of which I have never seen. He looked so much at \nhome in that outfit.\n  I said to him: How do the people back in Louisiana take to that kind \nof dress?\n  He said: You know, they would throw me out of office if I didn't do \nthese things. They expect that of me.\n  I also went down to New Orleans with him and saw him in a musical \nperformance with a zydeco band. He has musical talent most people don't \nknow about.\n  I tell you these things because people who follow the Senate, hear \nthe speeches, look at positions on issues and look at the party labels, \nforget that behind each and every one of us is a real life story.\n  I love the story of your family coming to Washington, John. It is a \nbeautiful story of packing up the kids and your first impression. Every \none of us has that story to tell. There are new Senators coming and \nsaving up those stories in their own minds for the day they stand \nbehind that desk to say what it means to be one of the few Americans \ngiven a chance to serve in this great Chamber.\n  We are going to miss John Breaux and all that he brought to the \nSenate and all he brought to this Nation. He has been a problem solver. \nHe has tried to reach across the aisle over and over to create \nbipartisan coalitions. Sometimes I was with him; sometimes I was not. \nIt did not make any difference because it was a good-faith effort on \nJohn Breaux's part to serve his State and this Nation.\n  He has had a great career in the House and the Senate. His departure \nwill leave a gap in terms of quality that many of us will work hard to \nfill. John, I am honored I could serve with you and that I could hear \nyour parting remarks this evening. I wish you and your family the very \nbest.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n\n                             Fritz Hollings\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes to talk \nabout our departing colleagues. I am going to start with the senior \nSenator from South Carolina, the senior Senator after many years of \nwaiting in the wings, and that is Senator Fritz Hollings.\n  I first got to know Fritz Hollings after I came to the Senate in \n1986. My wife Annette and I have worked with Fritz and his wife Peatsy. \nWe have traveled around the United States with them. We have been with \nthem in their home. We visited them in Charleston. We traveled around \nthe world with them.\n  He is a unique individual, to say the least, but he has had, as the \nPresiding Officer knows, a distinguished career as a State Senator in \nhis native South Carolina and then lieutenant governor\n\n[[Page S11473]]\n\nand Governor of his State before he came to the Senate I believe in \n1966.\n  He has had a distinguished career as chairman of the Commerce \nCommittee for many years and as a senior member of the Appropriations \nCommittee and chairman for many years, and ranking member now, of the \nAppropriations subcommittee dealing with State-Justice.\n  Fritz, we are going to miss you. We are going to miss your humor. We \nare going to miss your frankness. We are going to miss your wisdom. And \nwe are going to miss your wife Peatsy about whom we all care and love. \nYou have invited a lot of us to visit you in Charleston. I hope you add \nsome more rooms to that house there because a lot of us will be coming \nto see you. You have been a great American.\n  In addition to public service to his State and to the Nation, Fritz \nHollings was a young graduate of the Citadel in his hometown of \nCharleston before the Second World War, and he served with distinction \nas an officer in Europe for a long time through many battles.\n  I respect you, Fritz. I commend you for your service, and I look \nforward to visiting you both here and in Charleston in the years to \ncome.\n\n\n                              Don Nickles\n\n  One of my other colleagues we all care about and work with is Don \nNickles of Oklahoma. He came here as a very young man in 1980. He has \nbeen here 24 years. He was the whip, assistant majority leader. He was \nright here on this floor. He spent many days, many hours trying to herd \nus together as one of our leaders. He is now at the moment the chairman \nof the Budget Committee, and that is a feat in itself. He is a senior \nmember of the Finance Committee.\n  We wish you had stayed around, but you chose to leave the Senate on \nyour own volition. Don, we will see you, we will miss you, and I \ncommend you for your service to the Nation and to your great State of \nOklahoma.\n\n\n                              John Breaux\n\n  John Breaux was just on the floor a few minutes ago. I first met John \nBreaux when I came to the House of Representatives in 1978. He had \npreceded me, although he is a little younger. He was a young man in the \nHouse of Representatives. He was very involved and was one of the first \npeople I met there.\n  He tried to work with both sides, the Democrats and Republicans. He \nhas been involved in the forging of a lot of compromises--meaningful \nones--over the years. He has represented his State of Louisiana both as \na Congressman and as a Senator well, I believe, for many years. John, \nwe wish you and your wife Lois the best. We know you are not going to \ngo very far, but you have a lot of friends in the Senate on both sides \nof the aisle, and you know that.\n\n\n                              Tom Daschle\n\n  Tom Daschle will be leaving us. He served this Nation well. He served \nin the U.S. Air Force as an intelligence officer. He served as a \nstaffer, and then he was in my class in 1978 as a member of the House \nof Representatives. That is where I first met Tom and worked with him \nand respected him. Sometimes we would be on other sides of the issues, \nbut nevertheless, I always thought in his dealings with me and others \nhe was a very honorable, decent person.\n  He is a relatively young man. He served us well, I thought, as \nmajority leader. He was always fair and up front with us. He will go on \nto good things, I am sure. I wish Tom and his wife Linda the best.\n\n\n                               Bob Graham\n\n  Senator Bob Graham is a friend of mine, a Democrat, a former Governor \nof Florida for two terms. He came to the Senate in 1986 when I did. We \nworked together on many committees, but we worked closely together on \nthe committee you serve on today, Mr. President, and that is the \nIntelligence Committee.\n  I was the chairman of the committee and then he became the chairman \nwhen the Democrats got control of the Senate, and I was the vice \nchairman. I found Bob Graham to be working day in and day out, to be a \nvery upfront man, a very honorable man, a man of his word. I certainly \nwish him well in whatever he does in the future.\n\n\n                        Ben Nighthorse Campbell\n\n  My friend Senator Campbell, Ben Nighthorse Campbell, you talk about \nsomebody unique. He is a unique American. He is a Native American. He \nis proud of who he is. He has represented the State of Colorado, both \nin the House of Representatives and in the Senate, very well. I wish \nhim the very best. He will certainly not go away in the future.\n\n\n                              Zell Miller\n\n  Senator Zell Miller, the colleague of the Presiding Officer, is a \ndistinguished Senator from Georgia. He served as Lieutenant Governor of \nGeorgia, I believe, State senator, and then Governor of Georgia for at \nleast two terms. He came to the Senate and distinguished himself. He is \nsomeone for whom I have a lot of respect, for his integrity, for his \nforthrightness, for his grit, for his perseverance, and also his \nforesight.\n  Zell, we will miss you in the Senate. But we will see a lot of you. I \nhope to visit you in north Georgia. You tell me what a beautiful place \nit is, and it is not too far from my State of Alabama, so I hope you \nhave a room for us there. We will come see you, especially when the \napples are ready to pick and you are ready to show us around.\n\n\n                              John Edwards\n\n  We have also Senator Edwards from North Carolina. I first met John \nEdwards 6 years ago when he came to the Senate. He is a very \naccomplished lawyer, a very engaging person. He was the Democratic \nnominee, as we all know, for Vice President of the United States. John \nEdwards is a young man, a man with a lot of talent, and I am sure we \nwill hear from him in some respect, political or otherwise, in the \nfuture as life goes on.\n\n\n                            Peter Fitzgerald\n\n  Senator Peter Fitzgerald from Illinois is a very young man, one of \nthe youngest men to come to the Senate. He chose to serve only one \nterm. I think he has been involved in some of the big issues of the \nday. He is a man of integrity. He is a man who wants to do the right \nthing. He is always going to be involved in the issues of the day, as \nhe has been.\n  Peter, we wish you and your family the best as you go back into the \nprivate sector where you have excelled and done things so well and for \nso long.\n  We are going to miss all these Senators, on both sides of the aisle, \nbecause collectively they bring a lot of experience and a lot of wisdom \nto the Senate. They have served, as I said, with distinction and honor \nhere.\n\n\n                              TOM DASCHLE\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I want to take some time today to pay \ntribute to one of my closest and best friends in the U.S. Senate, our \nDemocratic leader, Tom Daschle.\n  It is hard to put into words how much I will miss Senator Daschle \nwhen he leaves the Senate at the end of this session. Senator Daschle \nand I were both first elected to the Senate in 1986. He immediately \nbecame a friend, and that friendship has only grown stronger over the \nyears. Senator Daschle had already served South Dakota in the House of \nRepresentatives for many years when he came to the Senate, so he was \nable to help show me the ropes when I first arrived in Washington in \n1987. His advice and counsel were given freely. But what really drew me \nto Tom were his genuine delight in seeing and greeting friends, staff \nand colleagues; his selfless passion for serving the people of South \nDakota; and, above all his wonderful, self-effacing sense of humor. Put \nsimply, Senator Daschle was able to take on issues very seriously \nwithout taking himself too seriously.\n  Over the years, we have served together on the Agriculture, Finance \nand Indian Affairs Committees. We have fought side-by-side in numerous \nbattles to serve the interests of the people of the Dakotas.\n  On the Agriculture Committee, Senator Daschle was a tireless advocate \nfor the interests of the northern plains producers we both represent. \nWe fought together for targeted farm assistance to ensure that scarce \nFederal dollars for commodity programs would most benefit average size \nfamily farms. We fought together against concentration in the \nagriculture industry. We fought together against unfairly traded \nimports of Canadian grain. We fought for disaster aid time and time \nagain. And we joined to make sure a new farm bill was enacted in 2002.\n  It is safe to say that without the active leadership and support of \nSenator\n\n[[Page S11474]]\n\nDaschle, we would not have had a new farm bill in 2002. And if we had \nnot written the bill in 2002, I firmly believe that mounting budget \npressures would have made it virtually impossible to write good \nlegislation in 2003 or 2004. So family farmers all across this country, \nmany of whom might not ever have heard of Tom Daschle, have lost a \nchampion.\n  On the Finance Committee, Senator Daschle fought passionately for \nbetter health care for all Americans. We fought together to strengthen \nthe Medicare program and improve payment rates for rural health care \nproviders. We fought to preserve the Medicaid program, which provides a \nhealth care safety net for the most vulnerable among us. We fought to \ncreate the State Children's Health Insurance Program, which expanded \nhealth coverage for children who otherwise would have no insurance. And \nSenator Daschle again and again took the lead on trying to reform our \nhealth care system to make health care affordable and accessible. So \naverage workers all across the country who worry about losing their \nhealth coverage or skyrocketing health costs have lost a champion.\n  And Senator Daschle took a special interest in working on behalf of \nNative Americans. He has fought to bring attention to the terrible \nepidemic of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome among Native Americans. And he has \nled the fight to secure increased resources for the Indian Health \nService to help end the health care rationing that occurs on too many \nreservations. He also has been a strong proponent of the tribal \ncolleges. His efforts have helped put a college education within reach \nof many Native Americans who might not otherwise get the opportunity. \nFinally, Senator Daschle stood up and gave a voice to the thousands and \nthousands of individual Indians seeking a full accounting of their \ntrust assets and fought to make sure that the Federal Government \nfulfilled its trust obligation. So Native Americans all across the \ncountry have lost a champion.\n  As Democratic leader, he continued to work on all these issues. And \nbecause he was leader, he delivered real results for real people, time \nand again. That was especially the case when it came to causes \nimportant to South Dakota. Senator Daschle tirelessly used his clout to \nensure that South Dakota's interests were protected.\n  But Senator Daschle's role as a Senator and as a leader cannot be \nsummed up in a simple listing of the causes and issues he championed, \noften without fanfare or great recognition. The job of leader has often \nbeen compared to herding cats. It is not easy, but Senator Daschle did \nan outstanding job. Senator Daschle was a strong leader--and a great \nSenator--because he didn't just listen to people, he heard their \nconcerns. He didn't just propose compromises, he built consensus. It \ntook enormous patience, great flexibility, strong persuasive skills--\nand a liberal dose of good humor and humbleness. It also meant that \nmuch of what Senator Daschle accomplished was done quietly behind the \nscenes. Too often, he did not get the public credit he deserved for the \npainstaking hours he spent building consensus and moving issues forward \nto benefit the American people. Instead, he quietly stepped back and \nlet others take credit.\n  You cannot be successful as a Senator, and especially as a leader, if \nother Senators cannot trust you. Senator Daschle may at times have left \nour colleagues on the other side of the aisle frustrated by his mastery \nof Senate rules and political tactics. But they always knew he was \nsomeone they could deal with in good faith. They always knew they could \ntrust his word. And they always knew he would work hard to achieve the \nresult he had committed to.\n  At the end of the day, that is the ultimate measure of Senator \nDaschle's values--the values he and I learned growing up in the \nDakotas. He was honest, fair and hard working. He gave credit to \nothers. And he genuinely respected his colleagues and enjoyed their \ncompany. South Dakota, the Senate, and the Nation are losing a true \nchampion, in every sense of the word.\n  As Senator Daschle goes on to other things, my wife Lucy and I wish \nall the best to Tom and his wife, Linda.\n\n\n                               bob graham\n\n  Mr. President, as the 108th Congress draws to a close, the Senate \nwill lose one of its most distinguished and accomplished members, \nSenator Bob Graham. Few Senators have had such an outstanding career in \npublic service. Bob Graham served as a Florida State legislator between \n1967 and 1978; as Governor between 1978 and 1982; and as U.S. Senator \nfrom 1987 to 2004. I am honored that Senator Graham and I were in the \nsame class following our elections to the Senate in 1986.\n  Throughout his years in public service, Senator Graham has taken a \nleadership role in protecting our environment, advocating on behalf of \nseniors and children for adequate health care, working to make certain \nthat our children achieve their highest potential in schools, and \nmaking certain that our country lives up to its obligations to veterans \nand active duty military personnel.\n  Early in his career as Governor of Florida, Senator Graham launched \none of our Nation's most significant efforts to protect the environment \nthrough the Save Our Everglades Program. In 2000, Senator Graham \nachieved his goal of restoring the Florida Everglades through an \nunprecedented partnership among Federal, State, and local officials \nalong with private industries. This initiative was a significant step \nto ensure protection of a critical wetland environment, the Florida \nwater supply and endangered species. Senator Graham's efforts were key \nto preservation of one of America's most important and environmentally \nsensitive natural treasures.\n  Throughout his career in public service, Senator Graham has also \ntaken a leadership role on behalf of public education. Long before the \nenactment of the No Child Left Behind Act, Senator Graham worked to \nimprove Florida public schools by making certain that children have the \nhighest quality public education system. He advocated on behalf of \nrigid student testing for competency in academic courses, worked to \nreduce class size, to improve the learning environment through new \nschool construction and to provide more opportunities for higher \neducation assistance for college students.\n  Through our years together in the Senate, I was privileged to work \nwith Senator Graham closely on health care and Social Security issues. \nAs a colleague for 10 years on the Senate Finance Committee, I noted, \nwith admiration, his concern for the health care needs for the elderly, \nespecially the need to strengthen Medicare and provide a prescription \ndrug benefit for the elderly. Senator Graham authored Medicare reform \nlegislation to provide a prescription drug benefit and other \npreventative health care benefits. His Medicare Prescription Drug, \nImprovement and Modernization Act of 2003 was cosponsored by one third \nof the Senate.\n  When it came to Social Security and Medicare, Senator Graham took a \nlong view. He missed no opportunity to urge all of us to make a \npriority of ensuring the long-term solvency of these two crucial \nprograms. His concern was not just the current needs of his Florida \nconstituents, but the importance of these programs for the income and \nhealth security of generations to come.\n  Last, Senator Graham assumed a leadership role on behalf of our \nNation's veterans and active duty military personnel in his capacity as \nRanking Member of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs. While he \nfocused considerable attention to the needs of our aging veterans \npopulation, working tirelessly to increase funding for VA medical care, \nhe has also been sensitive to the needs of veterans living in rural \nAmerica. Senator Graham supported my efforts to improve access to VA \nmedical care for rural veterans and to improve the quality of care for \nveterans at the Fargo VA Medical Center and through the expansion of \noutpatient clinics in rural communities. For this understanding and \nsupport for rural veterans, North Dakotans will be forever grateful.\n  There are many achievements by Senator Graham that I could cite \nthroughout his career in public service. The few accomplishments that I \nhave noted demonstrate remarkable dedication to our country--dedication \nto improving the lives of our children, the elderly and our veterans. \nSenator Graham represents the finest example of a dedicated and \ncompassionate public servant. I hope that Senator Graham's career will \ninspire young Floridians and other young people\n\n[[Page S11475]]\n\nacross our Nation to service for our country. I have been privileged to \nserve with Senator Graham and thank him for his distinguished service \nto our country.\n\n\n                              tom daschle\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I would like to say a few words about the \nman from which I have stood across this aisle the past 2 years--Tom \nDaschle.\n  Tom, as we all know, is a good and decent man. He has a big heart for \nthe people of South Dakota, for every Member of this body, and for all \nof the American people.\n  He has devoted his life to public service--from serving as an \nintelligence officer in the Air Force to serving four terms in the \nHouse to serving three terms in the United States Senate.\n  That is seven times Tom Daschle has been reelected statewide in South \nDakota.\n  Tom has been such a successful leader, because he has always put \nothers first. This selflessness, this sacrifice is the quality that I \nadmire most about Tom.\n  Every year Tom returned to South Dakota for an ``unscheduled \ndriving'' tour. He would travel without staff or a schedule--going \nwherever the road and the people of South Dakota would take him.\n  This driving tour helped him travel to each of South Dakota's 66 \ncounties--which he did every year.\n  But, most importantly, it was his way of staying in touch with the \npeople who sent him time and time again to Washington to represent \nthem.\n  Tom has served as the Democratic Leader for 10 years now. And those \nhave been no easy 10 years for the Senate or for America.\n  The Senate itself has switched hands and back again. And we have \nhelped lead the Nation through wars and recession and the horrific \nSeptember 11th attacks.\n  But throughout this Congress and throughout his career, Tom Daschle \nhas handled his job with grace and dignity. And I have always seen in \nhim a gentle, yet stirring passion.\n  I wish Tom and Linda and their family all the best in the many years \nto come.\n\n\n                              john edwards\n\n  Mr. President, John Edwards came to the Senate just 6 years ago. Yet \nhe has won us all over as friends for his sunny disposition, his \npositive attitude, his intelligence, and his hard work.\n  John can make anyone smile. He forms a personal bond with nearly \neveryone he meets. No doubt this quality comes from the fact that he \nalways remembers his roots.\n  The first member of his family to go to college, John grew up the son \nof two textile workers, moving from town to town.\n  This upbringing shaped John Edwards. It instilled in him a burning \ndesire to improve the world and a strong commitment to populist values.\n  He became a lawyer. And with ardent trial advocacy, hard work, and \ngenuine concern for others, he scored astounding success.\n  A terrible tragedy--the death of a child--marked a deciding point in \nhis life. He did not let it destroy him. Never forgetting the terrible \npain, John turned tragedy into triumph.\n  He set out to change America for the better. A political unknown, he \nfaced long odds, but he overcame them.\n  In the halls of the Senate, John has won new laws to protect \npatients, increased funding for public schools, and improvements to our \nbanking system.\n  He and Elizabeth, Catherine, Emma Claire, and Jack have been \ndelightful additions to our Senate family.\n  And our prayers are with them as they strive to overcome the \ndifficulty of Elizabeth's recent diagnosis of breast cancer.\n  John Edwards has already played a vital role in American public life. \nAnd whatever he chooses to do next, we wish him and Elizabeth and their \nentire family all the best for a bright future.\n\n\n                              don nickles\n\n  Mr. President, Senators follow many different paths on their way to \nthis Chamber. Some come from the professions, others from a life in \npublic service.\n  Few have lived the American dream the way Don Nickles has.\n  At age 20, Don Nickles was paying his way at Oklahoma State \nUniversity, living in a trailer home, working as a janitor, and raising \nhis growing family.\n  A few years later, he returned to his hometown. There he pulled his \nfamily business from the verge of bankruptcy. Pretty soon his neighbors \nelected him to the Oklahoma Senate.\n  Then, in 1980, at the age of 31, when few expected it, he became a \nU.S. Senator.\n  Don did not let his early success go to his head. He worked hard to \nkeep our country a place where men and women can dream big and live \nthose dreams.\n  In the Senate, he has been a friend to taxpayers, an opponent of \noverbearing regulation, a voice for traditional values, and an ardent \nadvocate for Oklahoma.\n  Don Nickles has worked to keep America a land of opportunity--a place \nwhere everyone has a valued place and nobody lacks the opportunities to \nsucceed.\n  Through all of his hard work, through all of his toil, he has always \nput family first. He and Linda have been married for 36 years. And they \nhave raised four wonderful children.\n  In Don's favorite Bible chapter, Galatians 5, the Apostle Paul lists \na godly man's attributes. A godly man, says Paul, work hard and live a \nlife of ``love, joy and peace . . . kindness, goodness, faithfulness.''\n  I could not think of a better description of Don Nickles. He has had \nan amazing career--and I take comfort in that he is just hitting his \nstride.\n  We all wish Don and his family the best in what will certainly be a \nbright future.\n\n\n                             Fritz Hollings\n\n  Mr. President, Fritz Hollings is a passionate advocate for the people \nof South Carolina, a true statesman, and a fine gentleman. He is one of \nthe most senior members of our body and, to all of us, he is a friend, \na mentor and a guide. He has devoted his life to public service.\n  Fritz Hollings has always shown courage, conviction, and an ability \nto get things done. His work has touched every corner of our country \nand every American's life.\n  Fritz helped our Nation confront its spiraling budget deficits, \nmaintain a strong posture against the Soviet Union, integrate our \nschools, and create the WIC program. His work has helped protect our \ncoastal ecology, preserve our oceans, and defend our transportation \nnetworks from terrorists attack. And, when a family eats dinner without \ninterruption, free from never-ending telemarketing calls, well, we can \nall thank Fritz for that too.\n  On trade, on spending, on taxes, on military issues, and on Senate \npay, he has never been afraid to speak his mind, even when his own \nparty, or sometimes even most of the Senate, disagrees with him. In the \nend, he has always been a winner thanks to his grace and honor. A \nsummary of Fritz' legislative achievements reads an astounding eight \nsingle-spaced pages. He's always campaigned on the creed that: \n``Performance is better than promise.'' And he has lived up to it.\n  We'll all miss Fritz: His friendship, his principles, and his \nwillingness to tell it like it is. We wish fritz and Peatsy all the \nbest and want them to know that they will always have a home, a family \nand a place in the history of the United States Senate.\n\n\n                        ben nighthorse campbell\n\n  Mr. President, Ben Nighthorse Campbell is a man of many talents. He \nis an Indian chief, a Korean war veteran, a champion quarter horse \ntrainer, an Olympic judo competitor, a rancher, and a jewelry designer.\n  After his service in the military and a series of athletic victories, \nBen settled down to run his ranch and design jewelry. But, by pure \naccident, politics entered his life. Colorado, the Senate, and America \nwould never be the same.\n  In 1982, Ben attended a meeting to support a friend's bid for \nSheriff. He made a stunning impression and walked away drafted as a \ncandidate for the Colorado State legislature. Ben served the people of \nColorado there and in the House of Representatives. And 12 years ago, \nthey elected him to the Senate.\n  More than 20 years after that fateful evening, Ben has left an \nindelible mark on the Senate. He has taken the lead on critical \nagricultural issues, fought excessive spending, argued for a balanced \nbudget, and sponsored Federal drought relief for farmers. From drug\n\n[[Page S11476]]\n\npolicy to natural resources conservation, he has advocated for Colorado \ninterests, and he has brought home what the people of his State elected \nhim to do. He has also sponsored or co-sponsored 54 Indian-related \nbills that became law. And he is the first American Indian ever to \nchair the Senate Indian Affairs committee. Without him, the spectacular \nMuseum of the American Indian that graces our National Mall would not \nhave become a reality.\n  Ben is as leader who stands firm by his beliefs and works hard for \nthe people of Colorado and Americans everywhere. We wish him and his \nwife, Linda, all the best for the future.\n\n\n                              john breaux\n\n  Mr. President, the people of Louisiana first sent John Breaux to \nserve in this Capitol in 1972. He was only 28 years old. For the next \n32 years, he would serve as one of the most respected and admired \npublic servants--from both sides of the aisle--anywhere in American \ngovernment.\n  John Breaux has been a superb United States Senator. He is not \ninextricably wedded to one ideology or one party's line. He is \nthoughtful. He is independent. He is deliberative. He is experienced. \nHe always wants to do the right thing for Louisiana and for America.\n  What I admire most about John is his consensus-building skills. He \nnever gives up on bringing people together. In fact, he has helped \nbring this body together on landmark pieces of legislation over the \npast two decades--from welfare reform to health insurance reform to \nbalancing the budget.\n  I have enjoyed working with John to reform Medicare. We proposed the \nfirst Breaux-Frist reforms in 1999. And we followed up with Breaux-\nFrist II in 2001. And we toiled together on the Bipartisan Commission \non the Future of Medicare, which John so ably chaired. Breaux-Frist \nlaid the foundation for bipartisan work to come and, ultimately, the \nmost comprehensive and meaningful improvements to Medicare since the \nprogram's creation.\n  John's departure is bittersweet for me--as I am sure it is for every \nmember of this body. We will miss him as a leader we all love and all \ncan work with. But he still has many of his best years ahead--which he \nwill no doubt enjoy spending with Lois and their wonderful and growing \nfamily.\n\n\n                            Peter Fitzgerald\n\n  Mr. President, Peter Fitzgerald has devoted his life to public \nservice.\n  He first ran for office before the ink on his law degree had dried. \nAnd, in the last 6 years, we have come to know Peter as a man of \nintegrity, as a man of honor, and as a friend.\n  In the Illinois Senate, he was a staunch opponent of corruption. He \noften had to go it alone. But he still got results.\n  He continued his mission in the United States Senate--where he \narrived in 1998 as our youngest member.\n  In only 6 years, he has made his mark. He helped uncover the \ndevastating corporate fraud and accounting scandals. And he helped us \npass tough new regulations to prevent them from reoccurring.\n  He has been an ardent advocate for Illinois farmers and businesses, \nalways working to make sure that markets are open and barriers are low.\n  Whether working to appoint honest federal prosecutors or taking a \nhard look at major federally-supported projects, he has always stood \nfor doing the right thing.\n  Peter has made sure that we have tax relief that helps families and \ncreates new jobs. And he has helped protect our children with tough new \nchild safety seat laws.\n  Our Senate family will miss Peter, Nina, and Jake. They have each \nenriched our lives, their State, this Senate, and our country. And we \nwish them all the best in the future.\n\n\n                               bob graham\n\n  Mr. President, during his first campaign for the United States Senate \nin 1986, People Magazine compared Bob Graham's mind to a Florida \nthunderstorm; resolute and impossible to deflect.\n  But as a member of this body for 18 years, Bob Graham has shown that \nwhile he may have the energy of a lightning storm, his works are guided \nwith far greater purpose and direction.\n  In 40 years, Bob has never lost a statewide election. He is one of \nFlorida's most beloved politicians. And that is for good reason.\n  Always looking for ways to connect with his constituents, Senator \nGraham uses his ``workdays'' to toil alongside everyday Floridians to \nunderstand the problems they face.\n  A true American patriot, he has consistently put country before \nparty.\n  On the Senate Intelligence Committee he has helped us tackle the \nmonumental task of overhauling America's intelligence agencies. We will \nall miss his knowledge, his expertise, and his ability to clarify \ndifficult issues.\n  Bob and his wife, Adele, have been treasured members of the Senate \nfamily--as much for who they are as for what they have done. For a \ncouple who has accomplished so much in their lives together, that's \nsaying something.\n  I want to thank Senator Graham for his valued contributions to our \nbody and to our country. And we wish him and Adele the best in all \ntheir future endeavors.\n\n\n                              zell miller\n\n  Mr. President, Zell Miller commands a certain respect. He has guts. \nHe has integrity. He speaks simple truths. He is as good and honest a \nman as I know.\n  Zell is the type of leader that takes a stand and doesn't yield an \ninch of ground--no matter how hard the political winds blow.\n  America saw this first-hand with his unwavering support of President \nBush in the most recent election.\n  At the Republican Convention, Zell described the President perhaps \nbetter than anyone in our own party. He said the President is: ``a God-\nfearing man with a good heart and a spine of tempered steel.''\n  Those same words also describe Senator Miller.\n  As a former Marine, Zell has never wavered in his support of the men \nand women in uniform who defend our liberty--or the values he shares \nwith them. And he has worked hard and steadfast to end the \nunprecedented filibuster of judicial nominees.\n  More than anything, Zell loves his wonderful wife, Shirley, and their \nfamily. Of course, by family, I also include Gus and Woodrow, his two \nLabrador Retrievers.\n  Zell will always be a touchstone of good ole' common sense for this \nbody. He will forever remind us that all we need to do is what is \nright--nothing more, nothing less.\n  Zell Miller is one of the most colorful Senators ever to grace the \nhalls of this Capitol. And he and Shirley have been two of the most \nvalued members of the Senate family.\n  We will miss them both, sorely, as a special part of our daily lives.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, are we in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, we are.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, on Tuesday the President announced the \nnomination of National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice to be the next \nU.S. Secretary of State.\n  I admire Dr. Rice's obvious intellectual gifts and her communication \nskills. I also believe that the President has the right to appoint \nCabinet officers who reflect his ideology and his perspective. Barring \nserious concerns about a nominee's qualifications or ethical record, \nand in keeping with Senate practices and precedents, my inclination is \nto give the President substantial deference in his Cabinet choices.\n  But I am deeply troubled by the signal that this nomination appears \nto send--a signal suggesting that the modest moderating influence of \nthe State Department over the last 4 years will disappear, and that the \nnext 4 years will be guided even more closely by the voices that \nshouted loudest in the first term, and that led our country into \nseriously flawed foreign policies. Our country cannot afford to \ncontinue down the foreign policy path that was forged during the first \nterm of the Bush administration.\n  Over the past 4 years, we have witnessed the greatest loss of a very \nvaluable type of American power in our history: our power to lead, to \npersuade and to inspire. As Joseph Nye has pointed out, this power will \nnot convert the extremists who oppose us no\n\n[[Page S11477]]\n\nmatter what. Those people must be eliminated, pure, and simple. But it \ncan thwart their plans, by denying them new recruits, undermining their \nappeal and their message, and unifying, rather than dividing, Americans \nand the rest of the international community. Rather than bolstering \nthis asset, which has helped to make us the most powerful country on \nearth, we have squandered it.\n  In March, the Pew Research Center found that one year after the start \nof the war in Iraq, ``discontent with America and its policies has \nintensified rather than diminished'' across the world. Majorities in \nPakistan, Jordan, Morocco and Turkey believe that the U.S. is \nexaggerating the terrorist threat, doubt the sincerity of the U.S. war \non terrorism and say that it is an effort to control Mideast oil and \ndominate the world. The Center found that:\n\n       At least half the people in countries other than the U.S. \n     say as a result of the war in Iraq they have less confidence \n     that the United States is trustworthy. Similarly, majorities \n     in all of these countries say they have less confidence that \n     the U.S. wants to promote democracy globally.\n\n  Our motives are questioned, our public justifications and \nexplanations viewed with skepticism, and our post-9/11 public diplomacy \nefforts have missed the mark, substituting pop music broadcasts, \nbrochures and videos for the kind of respectful dialogue and engagement \nthat could convince generations of angry young people that their \nhumiliation is not our goal.\n  We have had over 3 years since September 11, 2001, to think \nstrategically about how to win the fight against terrorism. But we have \nlittle to show for this time.\n  We have relied upon a doctrine that fails to recognize that our \nenemies do not rely on explicit state sponsorship of terrorism. By \nfocusing almost entirely on possible state sponsors of terror, the \nadministration failed to realize that our terrorist enemies operate \neffectively in weak and failing states and without the backing of \nnational governments. This is a new enemy waging a new war against us, \nbut the administration appears still to be stuck in an old cold war \nmindset.\n  We have muddled our language and our focus by conflating other \npriorities with the fight against terrorism, costing us credibility \naround the world and shattering the unified and resolved global \ncoalition that emerged to support us in the aftermath of 9/11. By \nchoosing to fight the war in Iraq in such a divisive and astronomically \nexpensive fashion, we have diverted resources away from the fight \nagainst the terrorist networks that seek to destroy us and undermined \nour ability to win the hearts and minds of many whose support we will \nneed to succeed in the long run.\n  We have recognized the dangers of nuclear proliferation in an age of \nterrorism, but have then pursued policies that may well create \nincentives for states to develop nuclear weapons as quickly as \npossible.\n\n  We have developed essentially no measures of success or failure when \nit comes to one of our most urgent priorities, as the 9/11 Commission \nunderscored--preventing the continued growth of Islamist terrorism. In \nfact, we do not even know where we stand today in this vital struggle.\n  We have not given any serious thought to how to avoid the mistakes of \nthe cold war, when we gave a free pass to forces of repression and \nbrutality, as long as they did not come with a Communist bent. Those \nmistakes, as we all know, helped to make Afghanistan the brutally \nrepressive terrorist haven that it was on 9/11.\n  We have not made an adequate investment in bolstering our diplomatic \nresources and engagement around the world. From Northern Nigeria to \nEastern Kenya, we have virtually no presence. In Somalia, despite \nknowing that al-Qaida-linked terrorists have operated in the country, \nwe simply failed to develop any policy at all.\n  While the administration's policy was failing on all of these fronts, \nthe President's team was devoting its time and attention to selling the \nworld and the American people a war in Iraq with fundamentally flawed \nintelligence, manipulative and misleading characterizations, and rosy \npredictions that provided horribly, dangerously off-the-mark. The \nadministration's Iraq policies in the first term painted a picture of \nan American government that isn't so sure it rejects torture; that \nisn't competent and careful enough to properly vet intelligence \npresented in major speeches and briefings; that willfully rejects the \nlessons of history and advice of its own experts; that is surprised \nwhen disorder results in massive looting; that misleads taxpayers \nregarding the costs and commitments entailed in its policies; that \nspends billions upon billions without any effort to budget for these \npredictable costs; and that is willing to politicize issues fundamental \nto our national security in the ugliest possible way.\n  We deserve better. Certainly the brave men and women of the U.S. \nmilitary who are fighting every day to make this effort in Iraq work \ndeserve better. We do not honor them by accepting lousy, irresponsible \npolicy in the halls and hearing rooms of the Capitol and then leaving \nthem holding the bag on the ground, when policy collides with the hard \ntruth.\n  The administration's record of the past 4 years suggests a foreign \npolicy careening out of control, driven by ideologies who want to test \ntheir theories in the laboratory of the Middle East one minute, by \ndomestic political considerations the next, and by spiteful attempts to \npunish those who disagree with their methods the next. Where is this \ngoing? Who is in charge? No one ever seems to be held accountable for \nthe blunders, the failures, the wildly inaccurate presentations and \nprojections or the painfully ineffective initiatives.\n  Congress cannot simply accept more of the same, keep our heads down \nand hope that somehow we will muddle through. The stakes are far too \nhigh. Our national security, the stability of the world that our \nchildren will inherit, our troops--even our country's honor--are on the \nline. Congress has an obligation, not to oppose every administration \neffort, but to reassert our role in steering the ship of state wisely \nrather than recklessly. I look at our foreign policy over the past 4 \nyears, and I know that America is so much better than this.\n  I look forward to the opportunity to raise these concerns with Dr. \nRice when she testifies before the Foreign Relations Committee, and to \nreceiving some assurance that she will work with Congress to put our \ncountry's foreign policy on a better, more effective footing.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart, to mourn \nthe loss of Komninos ``Gus'' Karellas, who was known and loved by so \nmany in the community of Mexico, MO. Though cut tragically short, his \nwas a life surrounded by a strong family and a strong community, and he \nwas a great example of an immigrant who came to America and took \nadvantage of every opportunity this country gave him.\n  Gus was a native of Greece, and he ran away from home as a teenager \nwith only a few cents to his name. He emigrated to American in 1965 via \nOakland, CA, and even though he did not speak English very well then, \nhe managed to succeed against all odds. He ended up in Iowa working at \na pizza restaurant, where he met Jimmy and Angelo Aslanidis, who became \nhis good friends. They ended up moving together to Columbia, MO, where \nGus worked at the University of Missouri for a short time before the \nthree of them helped start the G Steakhouse.\n  In 1971, Gus Karellas and his wife Mary moved away to help manage a \nnew G Steakhouse in Mexico, MO. Gus bought the restaurant one year \nlater and spent nearly every single day there, becoming a familiar \nfixture to the residents of Mexico for the next three decades. His \npopularity with people led some of his family to give him the \naffectionate nickname of ``Governor Gus.''\n\n[[Page S11478]]\n\n  Guy instilled his strong work ethic in his family, and friends say \nnothing made him prouder than his children Michael, Nick, Joanna, and \nAndy, who is an aide in my office. I have come to know Andy very well \nin the two years he has worked for me, and he is an accomplished young \nman with an immense sense of pride and gratitude for his family.\n  Gus was robbed and murdered as he was leaving his restaurant several \ndays ago. Since then, hundreds of people--friends and family, regulars \nof the restaurant, or even those who just casually knew Gus Karellas--\nhave visited the restaurant, creating a makeshift memorial of flowers, \ncandles, and cards to the man they came to know and love.\n  Gus Karellas was a loving husband and dedicated father, a good \nneighbor and good friend to many. He will be missed by all who loved \nhim. May he rest in peace and may God comfort his family and friends in \ntheir grief at his loss.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Talent).

Mr. President, I rise tonight to make a quick comment \nabout a dear friend. The greatest thing about serving in the House of \nRepresentatives and the Senate is meeting the colleagues we have the \nopportunity to serve with on both sides of the aisle. As a Member of \nthe House of Representatives, I had the opportunity to get to know a \nnumber of the Members of the Senate, one of whom is retiring at the end \nof this session.\n  Don Nickles was elected to the Senate when he was too young to serve \nin the Senate. He actually had a few months after his election before \nhe was old enough, but he was old enough before he was sworn in. That \nwas back in 1980. He has now served with great distinction in this body \nfor 24 years. He leaves with a record that not many Senators are able \nto claim after serving in this Senate for whatever period of time they \nmay be here.\n  Don Nickles has been a leader in the Republican Party, but most \nsignificantly he has been a leader in the Senate. He is a man who has \nprovided strong leadership on any number of issues, whether they are \nfiscal issues as chairman of the Budget Committee and a longtime member \nof the Budget Committee, which is where I first got to know him in our \nconferences between the House and the Senate, or whether it is on \nenergy or social issues, Don Nickles possesses all the assets that \nAmerica holds dear.\n  He is a strong family man. He is a hard-working individual. He is a \nman of faith. He is a man who when he looks you in the eye and tells \nyou something, you can go to the bank with it.\n  I am going to miss Don Nickles. I will miss his quick wit. I am going \nto miss his being able to stand up in the Senate and quickly take on \nanybody on either side of the aisle with respect to whatever the issue \nmay be or whatever the rule may be that applies to the issue that comes \nup.\n\n  I marveled at his ability to, off the top of his head, take on folks \non the other side of the aisle relative to a particular issue and to \npoint out issue by issue and point by point what must be done. That is \na unique capability and something that must be studied and learned.\n  My predecessor, one of the folks who held my seat many years before I \ngot here, was the master of that. That is Richard Russell. Don Nickles \nknows the rules just as well as Richard Russell did.\n  I will miss Don in a number of respects off of this Senate floor. He \nis a close personal friend. He and his wife Linda are dear friends of \nJulianne and me. I will have to find somebody else to get money off of \non the golf course because I have known Don so long now that I have \ncome to spend the money before I play golf.\n  He is a terrific guy both in the Senate as well as outside the \nSenate. He is a man of great integrity. He is the kind of Senator who \nevery citizen of Oklahoma should and has been proud of for his 24 years \nof service to the Senate.\n  I went back to his hometown a couple of months ago, his hometown of \nPonca City, OK, a very small town in America. Don was a football hero. \nAs in my home State of Georgia and my hometown, football is huge in \nPonca City. They still remember Don as a high school fullback and \nlinebacker.\n  His old coach was there that night to talk about Don and some of the \nthings he did during his high school career. It is those foundations \nthat people all across America build upon to come to the Senate.\n  The things that were said about Don back then could still be said \nabout him today; that is, what a dedicated person he was, what a hard-\nworking person he was, and what a student of the game he was, just like \nhe has been a student of the Senate.\n  No one there was surprised at what a great job Don had done as a \nMember of the Senate and what a success he was, what a success he will \nbe once he leaves. Don had the right kind of foundation and the right \nkind of instincts and the right kind of family stability, support, and \nlove to make sure he did the right kind of job in the Senate, and he \nwill continue to be successful when he leaves here.\n  To Don and to Linda, we say thanks for the service to our country. My \nchildren and my grandchildren are going to benefit from the service of \nthe Senate of Don Nickles. That is something for which I will forever \nbe grateful.\n  Just as importantly, I have been a better Senator than I would have \nbeen otherwise because of Don Nickles. In future years, because of what \nI have learned from Don Nickles, I will be a much better Senator.\n  Don, we appreciate your service to our country. Thank you. God bless \nyou and Linda.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank my Senate colleagues for passing \nthe resolution providing advice and consent to the Protocol amending \nthe existing U.S. Tax Treaty with the Netherlands through the unanimous \nconsent procedure.\n  In spite of legislative hurdles that arose during the process, this \nProtocol will be enacted, and will bolster the economic relationship \nbetween the United States and a country that is already both a good \nfriend and a critical\n\n[[Page S11479]]\n\ntrade and investment partner. As the United States considers how to \ncreate jobs and maintain economic growth, it is important that we try \nto eliminate impediments that prevent our companies from fully \naccessing international markets. In the case of taxes, we should work \nto ensure that companies pay their fair share while not being unfairly \ntaxed twice on the same revenue. Tax treaties are intended to prevent \nthis double taxation so that companies are not inhibited from doing \nbusiness overseas.\n  As the United States moves to keep the economy growing and to \nincrease U.S. employment, international tax policies that promote \nforeign direct investment in the United States such as this Protocol, \nare critically important. I have received communications from several \ncorporate employers. The foreign entities indicate that this Protocol \nwill provide them with incentives to ``insource'' to the United States. \nThe domestic companies indicate that this Protocol will provide overall \nadvantages and benefits. For the benefit of my colleagues, I am \nattaching to my statement several of these communications.\n  I thank my colleagues again for agreeing to pass this important \nmeasure.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the material I made reference \nto be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                            National Foreign Trade\n\n\n                                                Council, Inc.,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 22, 2004.\n       Dear Senator: I am writing to express our strong support \n     for the passage of the Tax Protocol with the Netherlands and \n     to urge you to enact the agreement this year. Further delay \n     in the passage of this agreement will subject U.S. companies \n     to double taxation and adversely affect their global \n     competitiveness. Foreign trade is fundamental to the economic \n     growth of U.S. companies. Tax treaties are a crucial \n     component of the framework that is necessary to allow that \n     growth.\n       The National Foreign Trade Council, organized in 1914, is \n     an association of some 300 U.S. business enterprises engaged \n     in all aspects of international trade and investment. Our \n     membership covers the full spectrum of industrial, \n     commercial, financial, and service activities, and the NFTC \n     therefore seeks to foster an environment in which U.S. \n     companies can be dynamic and effective competitors in the \n     international business arena. To achieve this goal, American \n     businesses must be able to participate fully in business \n     activities throughout the world. As global competition grows \n     ever more intense, it is vital to the health of U.S. \n     enterprises and to their continuing ability to contribute to \n     the U.S. economy that they are free from excessive foreign \n     taxes or double taxation and impediments to the flow of \n     capital that can serve as barriers to full participation in \n     the international marketplace.\n       This is why the NFTC has long supported the expansion and \n     strengthening of the U.S. tax treaty network. The Senate has \n     an excellent record in this area; ratifying tax agreements \n     with Japan, Australia, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Sri Lanka, \n     and Barbados during this Congress. The NFTC testified in \n     support of these agreements and of the Netherlands Protocol.\n       Senator Richard Lugar, Chairman of the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations, recently sent a Dear Colleague letter encouraging \n     all Senators to support passage of the Dutch Protocol in the \n     post-election session. I hope that the full Senate can act \n     favorably on this agreement in the time that remains in this \n     session and reaffirm the historic opposition of the U.S. to \n     double taxation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               William A. Reinsch,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.,\n\n                                  Allentown, PA, October 26, 2004.\n     Re Ratification of the Protocol to the Income Tax Treaty with \n         the Netherlands.\n\n     Hon. Richard G. Lugar,\n     Chairman, Committee on Foreign Relations, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Lugar: On behalf of Air Products and \n     Chemicals, Inc., I would like to thank you and the Committee \n     for the prompt consideration and attention that you have \n     given to the proposed protocol to the income tax treaty with \n     the Kingdom of the Netherlands. This protocol is very \n     important to Air Products and the United States economy. It \n     is very important to us that the Senate ratify the protocol \n     as soon as possible.\n       Air Products is a United States company with global \n     headquarters in Allentown, Pennsylvania. It serves customers \n     in technology, energy, healthcare and industrial markets \n     worldwide with a unique portfolio of products, services and \n     solutions, providing atmospheric gases, process and specialty \n     gases, performance materials and chemical intermediates. The \n     company has annual revenues of $7 billion, operations in over \n     30 countries, and over 18,000 employees.\n       Air Products has operated in the Netherlands for over \n     thirty years, and it has substantial operations in the \n     Netherlands. Air Products also owns some of its other \n     European operations through the Netherlands. Air Products \n     generates substantial cash flow from these operations. The \n     current 5 percent withholding tax rate discourages Air \n     Products from repatriating this cash back to the U.S. This is \n     especially true because Air Products is currently in an \n     excess foreign tax credit position. The proposed protocol \n     would remove this barrier to repatriating cash. This would \n     benefit not only Air Products but the U.S. economy as a \n     whole. The protocol would remove this repatriation barrier \n     for all U.S. companies with Dutch holdings, and foreign \n     companies would have a greater incentive to invest in the \n     U.S. The sooner the Senate ratifies the protocol, the sooner \n     these benefits will begin.\n       Accordingly, we respectfully request that the Senate \n     consider ratification of the proposed protocol as soon as \n     possible.\n       If you have any questions regarding Air Products' views on \n     the proposed protocol, please contact me or Charles Stinner, \n     our International Tax Director (610-481-2978).\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Kenneth R. Petrini,\n     Vice President--Tax.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                 Sunoco, Inc.,\n\n                               Philadelphia, PA, October 26, 2004.\n     Re Ratification of Protocol to United States-Netherlands \n         Income Tax Treaty.\n\n     Hon. Richard G. Lugar,\n     Chairman, Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Lugar: On behalf of Sunoco, Inc., I am \n     writing to urge the prompt ratification of the protocol to \n     the Netherlands Income Tax Treaty signed on March 8, 2004. As \n     you are aware, the proposed protocol makes significant \n     changes to the existing income tax treaty between the United \n     States and the Netherlands. These changes include the \n     elimination of source-country withholding on certain \n     intercompany dividends, modernization of anti-treaty shopping \n     provisions, coordination of the countries' pension rules and \n     the provision of clear rules for investments using \n     partnerships.\n       The changes negotiated in the protocol are important to the \n     successful business operations of many companies, including \n     Sunoco, and a failure to promptly ratify the protocol will \n     have a detrimental impact on the conduct of business by many \n     multinational corporations. Moreover, in a report dated \n     September 30, 2004, the Joint Committee on Taxation estimated \n     that ratification of the protocol would cause a negligible \n     change in Federal budget receipts during the fiscal period \n     2005-2014.\n       Accordingly, for the reasons stated above, Sunoco believes \n     that the protocol to the Netherlands Income Tax Treaty should \n     be promptly ratified, and urges you to support its \n     ratification.\n       If you or your staff would like to discuss this issue in \n     more detail or if we can provide additional information, \n     please contact the undersigned at (215) 977-6795.

This increase in funds provides Mary \n     Kay Inc with the funds to expand its US plant, increase \n     research and development, which is accomplished in the United \n     States and hire more US based employees.\n       Please ask Senator Frist to schedule the treaty as soon as \n     possible, before time runs out.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Michael Lunceford,\n     Senior Vice President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                       Sun Microsystems, Inc.,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 2, 2004.\n     Senator Richard Lugar,\n     Chairman, Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Hart Senate \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Lugar: On behalf of Sun Microsystems, Inc., I \n     am writing to express our appreciation of your efforts to \n     seek prompt ratification of the recent Protocol to the U.S.-\n     Netherlands income tax treaty.

Compared to \n     other U.S. tax treaties with major trading partners, the \n     current treaty between the United States and the Netherlands \n     is antiquated and contains obstacles to the free flow of \n     trade between the two countries that will be eliminated by \n     the new Protocol.

A strong tax treaty network is critical for U.S. \n     businesses, such as ChevronTexaco, to compete in the global \n     marketplace. We appreciate your efforts on tax treaties \n     generally, and on this Protocol in particular.\n       We urge the Senate to ratify the Protocol before year end \n     so that it may enter into force on January 1, 2005. Delaying \n     ratification until 2005 would delay entry into force until \n     January 1, 2006 and would delay the important reductions to \n     withholding tax rates.\n       I sincerely hope that the Senate will ratify the Protocol \n     in 2005 and we appreciate your efforts to ensure this.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                Lisa B.

Richard G. Lugar,\n     Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lugar: The American Chemistry Council urges \n     ratification of the bilateral tax protocol between the United \n     States and the Netherlands.\n       The ACC represents the leading companies engaged in the \n     business of chemistry. Council members apply the science of \n     chemistry to make innovative products and services that make \n     people's lives better, healthier and safer. The business of \n     chemistry is a $460 billion enterprise and a key element of \n     the nation's economy. It is the nation's largest exporter, \n     accounting for ten cents out of every dollar in U.S. exports.\n       We commend your efforts as Chairman of the Foreign \n     Relations Committee that resulted in negotiation of the tax \n     protocol with the Netherlands. The treaty would enhance the \n     ability of U.S. companies to compete in the important Dutch \n     market, and if history is a guide, the treaty would create \n     U.S. jobs within the chemical industry and among our \n     suppliers and customers, and it would encourage foreign \n     companies to establish or expand manufacturing facilities in \n     the U.S. Moreover, the information-sharing provisions of the \n     treaty would aid the IRS and Treasury Department in \n     identifying international tax-avoidance schemes that reduce \n     federal tax receipts and impugn the motives of U.S. companies \n     whose global operations represent a major element of an \n     expanding U.S. economy.\n       Accordingly, we urge ratification of the Dutch Treaty \n     during the time remaining in the 108th Congress. Timely \n     ratification would result in early realization of treaty \n     benefits, and aid companies in capital planning and business \n     expansion.\n       Please call if we can answer questions or provide \n     additional information.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Charles W.

Biden, Jr.,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Foreign Relations, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators: On March 8, 2004, the United States and the \n     Netherlands signed the Protocol Amending the Convention \n     Between the United States of America and the Kingdom of the \n     Netherlands for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the \n     Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income. \n     We at DuPont would urge the Senate to ratify this Protocol \n     before Congress adjourns.\n       As you learned during testimony on September 24th, the \n     Protocol brings the existing Convention, concluded in 1992, \n     into closer conformity with current U.S. tax treaty policy. \n     Of particular interest to DuPont, considering the Company's \n     manufacturing sites in the Netherlands, is the elimination of \n     withholding taxes on certain types of cross-border direct \n     dividends. This element of the Protocol creates a powerful \n     tool for repatriating earnings the Company would then be able \n     to devote to our priorities in the United States. In \n     addition, the Protocol's reciprocal treatment of pension \n     funds for international employment assignees allows DuPont \n     employees to gain valuable experience through U.S.-\n     Netherlands exchanges without jeopardizing the status of \n     their retirement benefits.\n       DuPont also appreciates the benefits the new Protocol would \n     offer the U.S. government. Among them, the improved \n     communications measures between U.S. and Dutch tax \n     authorities coupled with the assistance in the collection of \n     taxes; and the modernized Limitation on Benefits article, \n     designed to deny treaty-shoppers the benefits of the \n     Convention.\n       The enhancement of economic ties between the United States \n     and the Kingdom of the Netherlands in the form of the pending \n     Protocol will promote the growth of trade and investment \n     between the two countries to the benefit of both economies. \n     As such, it is DuPont's hope that deliberations on the \n     Protocol will be completed this year.\n           Sincerely,\n     Marshall G. McClure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/18/senate-section/article/S11480-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11480-S11482]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          DEBT LIMIT INCREASE\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I speak about the vote that took place \nyesterday to raise the statutory limit of our\n\n[[Page S11481]]\n\nNation's indebtedness. It is terribly unfortunate that for the third \ntime in three years this administration has run up against the Federal \ndebt limit, thereby forcing once again an increase in the National debt \nfrom $7.384 trillion to $8.184 trillion.\n  I think it is a mistake for this body to give the administration what \nis essentially an $800 billion check to continue its irresponsible \nfiscal policies.\n  For quite some time now, the Treasury Department has been forced to \nhalt payments owed to federal retirement accounts and take other \nextraordinary measures in order to keep the government from defaulting. \nAnd now we are in a position where the Treasury Department has said \nthat Congress must increase the debt ceiling by the end of this week or \nthe government will default on its obligations. What this says is that \nthe government is living far beyond its means.\n  Just several years ago, when President Clinton was President, the \nNational debt was shrinking, not growing. In 1997, the debt held by the \npublic was $3.745 trillion. By FY2001, it decreased by more than $400 \nbillion to $3.296 trillion. Former President Clinton made it a goal to \npay off the debt by 2013, so that America would be debt free for the \nfirst time since 1835. He recognized that eliminating the debt would \nstrengthen our economy, allow investments in education and other \ncritical priorities, and ensure that Social Security could meet the \nchallenges to come when the baby boomers retire.\n  By contrast, under the Bush administration, the debt limit was raised \nby $450 billion in 2002 and $984 billion in 2003. And now, this year, \nin 2004 it will increase by $800 billion. I find it astounding that \njust four years ago we were having compelling conversations in the \nSenate Banking Committee with Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan \nabout what would happen if we paid off the debt too quickly. And now, \nhere we are about to pass another increase of $800 billion to the \nNational debt.\n  This new increase will bring the grand total to more than $2 trillion \nunder President Bush--the largest total debt limit increase recorded \nunder any President. Now instead of being eliminated, we are expecting \nthe debt held by the public to reach $6.5 trillion by 2011.\n  When President Bush first came to office he assured the nation that \nif we adopted his tax cuts, we would not only see job growth, but we \nwould still be able to eliminate the publicly held debt by 2008. \nInstead, we have seen 1.5 million private-sector jobs lost, making this \nthe first Administration since Herbert Hoover to actually lose jobs. In \njust 4 years, we have gone from a projected 10-year surplus of $5.6 \ntrillion to a 10-year deficit of over $3 trillion. And now we are about \nto once again, for the third year in a row, increase the debt.\n  If additional debt is going to be accumulated, the administration and \nthe majority could at the minimum ensure that we are adequately \ninvesting in our children's education, the country's infrastructure, \nhealth care, the solvency of Social Security, and other vital national \npriorities. But that does not appear to be the case considering that we \nare seeing across the board cuts in the upcoming omnibus bill, and this \nAdministration continues to push for policies that push us further in \nthe red without any real results.\n  The administration's reckless policies will pass the burden of paying \nfor them onto future generations, and unfortunately, the administration \nhas shown absolutely no regard for the hardship this will cause. We \noften discuss the so-called ``death tax'', this administration's \nreckless fiscal policies are forcing a ``birth tax'' on every child \nborn today.\n  What do I mean by the term ``birth tax''? Simply this: a child born \ntoday is born owing his or her country $25,000. That is that child's \nshare of the national debt. This is unconscionable. We have a \nresponsibility as lawmakers to leave our country better off tomorrow \nthan it is today. With policies like this, I am afraid that this \nadministration and its supporters are failing to meet this fundamental \nmoral responsibility to our country and to future generations.\n  Also deeply troubling is that in order to cover increased borrowing, \nthe U.S. is going deeper into debt to foreign countries. Japan, China, \nthe United Kingdom, and Caribbean Banking Centers are now the largest \nforeign holders of U.S. Treasury Debt.\n  We have borrowed over $720 billion from Japan, over $174 billion from \nChina, and even tens of billions of dollars from South Korea. During \nthe term of the President's first four years, we have seen our foreign \ndebt holdings increase 83 percent from just over $1 trillion to over \n$1.8 trillion. This is especially dangerous because these countries can \ncollect their debt when it suits them, which could potentially puts our \nnation in a very difficult economic situation.\n  I find it astounding that the administration and the majority of this \nCongress have not put forward any plan to reduce the alarming increase \nin our nation's debt--an increase largely caused by their reckless tax \nand budget policies. Indeed, their only known plans to permanently \nextend tax breaks for the affluent and drain at least $1 trillion from \nSocial Security--would only make our current problems worse.\n  I strongly believe that increasing the debt limit once again without \na plan is a big mistake. We owe it to future generations to do more to \nensure that their future is economically sound. I hope that this \nAdministration, and the majority of the Congress begin to enact more \nresponsible fiscal policies before it truly is too late.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, yesterday I voted against legislation \nthat will authorize a massive increase in the Federal debt. This bill \nhighlights the gross irresponsibility of our Nation's current fiscal \npolicies. And I hope that, in casting a negative vote along with many \nof my colleagues, we have helped send a message to the White House that \nit is long past time to change course.\n  When President Bush came to office, we were expecting to run a \nsurplus over the next ten years of $5.6 trillion. Instead, we now \nproject a deficit of $3.5 trillion. That is a reversal of more than $9 \ntrillion.\n  President Bush promised that he would not raid the Social Security \ntrust fund. But, instead, under the Bush budget, we will spend every \nlast penny of Social Security surpluses over the next 10 years, all \n$2.4 trillion. These surpluses won't be saved. They won't be used to \nhelp us keep our promise to working Americans. They will be diverted \nfor tax breaks and other spending programs. This is not what the \nPresident promised. It is the opposite.\n  In effect, the administration's policies are using payroll taxes paid \nby working Americans, and using them to finance tax breaks for the most \nfortunate among us. I think that is wrong.\n  The past few years have been marked by unprecedented fiscal \nrecklessness. The 2004 deficit, even including the Social Security \nsurplus, is $413 billion. That is a record. Last year, the deficit was \n$377 billion. That was another record. The budget is spinning out of \ncontrol, and few in the administration seem to care.\n  Unfortunately, as bad as things have been in recent years, the \noutlook for the long term is even worse. The baby boomers are about to \nretire. And by 2050, 81 million Americans will be on Social Security--\nabout double the current level. We need to prepare for that. We need to \nsave for it. Instead, we are doing the reverse. We are putting \nourselves deeper and deeper in debt.\n  In 2001, gross Federal debt stood at $5.8 trillion. By 2014, that \ndebt will have skyrocketed to almost $15 trillion.\n  With more debt, of course, comes higher interest costs. The 10-year \ncost of Federal interest payments has gone up from $622 billion in \n2001, to $2.4 trillion.\n  All this debt, and all these interest payments, have consequences. \nThey reduce the capital available for productive investment. They \nincrease interest rates. They slow economic growth. And they lower the \nstandard of living for American families.\n  Another consequence of all this debt is that our Nation is slowly \nlosing its economic independence. Foreign holdings of U.S. Treasury \ndebt has increased 83 percent under this administration. Today, the \nU.S. owes China more than $170 billion. We owe Japan more than $700 \nbillion. Increasingly, our Nation is dependent on these countries to \nbolster our economy and to maintain the value of the dollar. But if\n\n[[Page S11482]]\n\nthose countries and other foreign investors pull out in the face of \nrising fiscal imbalances, as has happened elsewhere, the consequences \nfor our economy could be very serious.\n  In my view, the current course of fiscal policy is not only unwise \nand dangerous, it is ultimately unsustainable. We can't go on like \nthis. Either our leaders here in Washington will face reality and \nreverse course, or the markets will punish us until we do. Either the \ndollar will collapse, or interest rates will rise substantially, or \ninflation will rise, or all these problems will hit at once.\n  When that might happen is anybody's guess. But you can't reverse the \nbasic laws of economics. Sooner or later, the piper gets paid.\n  So, I think we have made a mistake by increasing the debt limit so \nsubstantially. Needless to say, we must protect the full faith and \ncredit of the United States. But we do not need a debt limit extension \nof this magnitude. And we should not have approved it yesterday. \nInstead, we should have passed a much smaller increase, in order to put \nreal pressure on the Congress next year to finally get serious about \nthe need for fiscal discipline.\n  Next year we will begin perhaps the most important domestic policy \ndebate in a generation when we take up President Bush's call to \nprivatize Social Security. At that point, Congress will have to make a \ndecision. Either we will keep our promise to American workers, or we \nwill break that promise and cut earned benefits. I think we should keep \nour promise and protect benefits. But we can only afford to do that if \nwe quickly reestablish some measure of fiscal discipline.

Mr. President, I seek recognition to describe \nlegislation that I plan to introduce in the 109th Congress. I have been \nasked to pursue this legislation on behalf of the 158 families of the \nbrave servicemen who died when the terrorist faction Hezbollah--with \nthe support of the Government of Iran--sent a suicide bomber into the \nMarine Corps Barracks in Beirut, Lebanon, on October 23, 1983, killing \n241 U.S. servicemen--18 sailors, 3 soldiers, and 220 Marines.\n  This legislation will provide an explicit private right of action for \nUnited States citizens against state sponsors of terrorism in our \nFederal courts, and will ultimately allow victims of such acts to \ncollect court-ordered damages against state-sponsors of terrorism. The \nspecific provisions of the legislation have been drafted to harmonize \nexisting statutory law with the recent direction of the District of \nColumbia circuit in Cicippio-Puleo v. Islamic Republic of Iran, 353 \nF.3d 1024 (D.C. Cir. 2004), which held that ``neither 28 U.S.C. \nSec. 1605(a)(7) nor the Flatow Amendment to the Foreign Sovereign \nImmunities Act . . ., nor the two considered in tandem, creates a \nprivate right of action against a foreign government.'' 353 F.3d 1024, \n1032-33 (D.C. Cir. 2004).\n  In 1996, I supported the legislation that ultimately was enacted into \nthe statutes that I have just cited. These statutes have been \ninterpreted by the D.C. Circuit in Cicippio-Puleo to provide the \nfollowing:\n  No. 1, 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1605(a)(7) provides an exception to sovereign \nimmunity for state sponsors of terrorism and permits Federal courts to \nhear claims seeking money damages for personal injury or death against \nsuch nations and arising from terrorist acts they commit, or direct to \nbe committed, against American citizens or nationals outside of the \nforeign state's territory; and No. 2, 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1605(a)(7)(note), \nalso known as the ``Flatow Amendment,'' named for New Jersey student \nAlisa Flatow, who was killed when Palestinian Islamic Jihad bombed a \nGaza bus on which she was riding, imposes liability upon an official, \nemployee, or agent of a foreign state that is designated as a state \nsponsor of terrorism, only if that official, employee or agent is \nacting in their ``official capacity.''\n  On October 23, 2004, in Philadelphia, I was privileged to take part \nin a memorial service held in honor of the servicemen killed in the \n1983 Beirut attack. Some of the family members of those killed attended \nthe event. Their moving comments about how they have been denied the \nability to seek legal redress, despite clear findings implicating \nHezbollah and Iran in the attacks, were both poignant and persuasive. \nIt is vitally important to victims' families that they have a private \nright of action against the state sponsor itself, not just its \nofficials, employees or agents acting in their official capacity. These \nvictims and their families deserve not simply a day in court, but also \nthe ability to recover damages against terrorist states that commit, \ndirect, or materially support terrorist acts against American citizens \nor nationals. The former, in isolation, is a hollow right--in legal \nterms, a right without a remedy. The D.C. Circuit in Cicippio-Puleo \ntells us that only Congress can provide such a remedy. That is my \nintent.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the October 23, 2004, remarks by Lynn \nSmith Derbyshire, the sister of deceased Marine CPT Vincent Smith and a \nleader of the families advocating for this legislation, be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Remarks of Lynn Smith Derbyshire, Beirut Memorial Services, Oct. 23, \n                                  2004\n\n       We are here today to honor the men who died in Beirut, \n     Lebanon on this day 21 years ago. As families, we believe \n     that our first duty is to remember. Thank you for coming to \n     help us commemorate the lost.\n       As you know, in 1996 Congress passed legislation that gave \n     victims of state sponsored terrorism, and their families, the \n     right to sue those nations in a United States Court. This \n     legislation did two things: It gave us a path to pursue \n     justice and compensation, and it provided a way to hold rogue \n     nations accountable for their crimes, and thereby deter more \n     terrorism. The problem with the existing legislation, \n     however, is that it has loopholes. And the U.S. Government is \n     using these loopholes to continually torpedo the efforts of \n     the families to collect damages, and penalize terrorist \n     states.\n       On October 23, 1983--21 years ago today--Hezbollah, at the \n     behest of the government of Iran, sent a suicide bomber into \n     the Marine Corps Barracks in Beirut Lebanon, killing 241 U.S. \n     servicemen.\n       One of the young Marines who was killed that day was a \n     blond, blue-eyed, bowlegged helicopter pilot, named Captain \n     Vincent Smith. He had just turned 30. He had a wife named \n     Ana, a 3-year-old son named Ian, and dog named Whiskey. Vince \n     had a penchant for practical jokes, an infectious laugh and a \n     contagious grin. He sang in the church choir with his velvety \n     tenor voice, he loved to water-ski, and throw the football \n     with his brothers on crisp fall afternoons--like this one, \n     and have cookouts on the deck with his friends.\n       Vince was my brother. He was my protector, my confidant, \n     and my friend. And I loved him deeply. Twenty-one years after \n     his death there is still a hole in my heart and in my life, \n     and in my family. I miss him more every day.\n       I have learned over the past 21 years that one does not \n     ``get over'' the murder of a brother. Whoever said that time \n     heals wounds was an idiot--and whoever said that never had a \n     wound like this. My wound cannot completely heal, because \n     every time there is another terrorist attack, the hole in my \n     heart is ripped open again:\n       The U.S. Embassy in Beirut, the Achille Lauro, the murder \n     of Robert Stetham of TWA flight 847, Khobar Towers in Saudi \n     Arabia, the U.S.S. Cole, Madrid, and even this morning, a car \n     bomb outside of Baghdad killed 10 and wounded 42.\n       And who here can ever forget that fateful day: September \n     11, 2001.\n       One after the next, after the next, these events have \n     sliced open my scar-tissued heart, and I must grieve the \n     brother I loved so dearly over and over again. All of these \n     events bring me to my knees. And when I am on my knees I pray \n     for justice--not revenge--justice.\n       I do not want vengeance. I do not want the sisters and \n     mothers of young vibrant Iranian soldiers to have to weep at \n     the closed casket of their brothers and sons as I did, \n     knowing that his body is not even whole inside the box. I do \n     not want anyone to discover as I have that this kind of grief \n     is an incessant pain-and it hurts all over. I would not wish \n     the last 21 years of agonizing sorrow on a rabid dog. No. I \n     do not want vengeance.\n       But I do want justice. And I do want the terrorism to stop.\n       In March 2003, the Beirut families brought suit against the \n     country of Iran for the murder of our beloved brothers and \n     sons and fathers and husbands. We proved in a court of law, \n     that Hezbollah was carrying out the direct will of the \n     Iranian government. Iran is guilty of the murder of my \n     brother, and of\n\n[[Page S11483]]\n\n     Freas Kreischer's son, and Shirla Maitland's brother.\n       That day in court was a moral victory for us. There was a \n     tremendous sense of relief to finally be able to name the \n     guilty party. But it's a hollow victory if Iran is not \n     somehow held accountable. Terrorists continue to terrorize \n     because they can. We have not held them accountable for their \n     crimes, and so they laugh and build more bombs. There has \n     been no justice, so there can be no healing.\n       And it is galling that my own government continues to allow \n     Iran to get away with murder--literally.\n       It's a simple rule: one that the parent of any small child \n     can grasp. If your child hits another child with a stick, you \n     have to take the stick away, and give your child \n     consequences. If there are no consequences, the child will \n     keep hitting kids with sticks, because he has figured out \n     that it gives him power.\n       I want the cruelty and senselessness of terrorism to stop. \n     And there is only one way to do that. We have to take away \n     the stick. There must be consequences.\n       Senator Specter, thank you for introducing a bill that will \n     finally allow families like mine and Freas Kreishcher's and \n     Shirla Maitland's, to pursue rogue nations in the courts and \n     to threaten them by threatening their assets. Their Achilles \n     heel is financial. If we take away enough of their money, \n     they will not be able to afford to build more bombs. And then \n     perhaps you will be spared the agony of losing your brother \n     or your son. If that happens, perhaps this gaping, bleeding \n     wound in my heart will finally be able to heal.\n       Senator Specter, I want to thank you, on behalf of the \n     families of the Marine Corps Barracks, Beirut bombing \n     victims, for coming to our aid. Thank you for being willing \n     to champion our cause in the Congress by sponsoring this \n     bill. And Senator, I urge you to do everything in your power \n     to enact this bill into law with the utmost haste.\n       Thank you very much, sir.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/18/senate-section/article/S11483-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11483]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   COUNCIL ON OCEANS POLICY AWARENESS\n\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, recently, the U.S. Commission on Ocean \nPolicy made a series of far-reaching recommendations to help keep our \noceans viable for future generations. While the Senate as a whole will \nnot address these recommendations this Congress, I hope we may be able \nto work on these critical issues next year.\n  In the meanwhile, my home State of North Carolina has already begun \nto make real the recommendations of the Commission. For instance, North \nCarolina public schools have begun fostering formal ocean education in \nK-12 schools, after the State mandated inclusion of ocean curricula in \nmiddle school.\n  North Carolina is also leading the Nation in heeding the call for \nimproved scientific understanding of the oceans. Of particular pride is \nthe success of the Southeast Coastal Ocean Observing System, or \nSEACOOS, an umbrella organizations of institutions that is building a \nregional ocean monitoring and prediction system for the southeast \nStates of North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and Florida.\n  Through the leadership of the University of North Carolina at Chapel \nHill, SEACOOS aggregates ocean information from federal and non-Federal \nsources for display and redistribution. This information system \nsupports many uses, from search and rescue and hazardous spill response \nto providing information for recreational boaters and fishermen. This \ncollaborative effort among dozens of institutions is a model of \nteamwork that will enable rapid development of a relevant, user-driven \nmulti-purpose system.\n  As part of the larger IOOS system, SEACOOS will improve the decision-\nmaking process for coastal managers, severe weather response teams, and \nso many others in whose decisions coastal conditions are a factor. \nThrough its scientific contributions to data collection and analysis, \nSEACOOS will advance the Nation's needs in such broad areas as: marine \noperations, e.g. shipping and offshore operations like drilling and \nmining; natural hazard mitigation, e.g. storm forecasting, surge \nprediction, tsunami warning; climate change and its effects, e.g. \ninterannual variability in water temperature, salinity, nutrients, \nstorminess, plankton species and abundance, fish species and abundance; \nnational security, e.g. toxin trajectories, detection of covert \noperations; public health, e.g. unsafe biological activity, rip \ncurrents, harmful algal blooms; ecosystem health, e.g. changes in food \nweb structure; and sustainable use of marine resources, e.g. fish stock \nassessments.\n  Among so many throughout the southeast who have made SEACOOS \npossible, I especially want to note and thank Harvey Seim, Associate \nProfessor of Marine Science at UNC Chapel Hill. Professor Seim has been \nthe visionary and leader in building this collaborative initiative. His \ndedication to advancing scientific knowledge that serves the public \ninterest embodies the best spirit of higher education and the academic \nresearch enterprise that makes our nation great.\n  In keeping with the recommendations of the commission, SEACOOS is a \nmodel worthy of replicating around the country. It is consistent with \nthe Integrated Ocean Observing System that is called for in the \ncommission report. IOOS is a national, interagency program that the \ncommission recommends be fully funded and implemented to provide a \nmultipurpose ocean information system for the Nation. Legislation to \nauthorize IOOS has already been unanimously passed by the Senate, S. \n1400 and companion bills are pending in the House. I look forward to \ncontinued congressional support and continued success as we increase \nour knowledge and understanding of our oceans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/18/senate-section/article/S11483-2", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11483]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH.

Mr. President, this past September marked a devastating \nhurricane season for many States. My home State of North Carolina was \nravaged by not one, but four hurricanes this fall. Western North \nCarolina was particularly hit hard by Hurricanes Frances and Ivan, \nwhich destroyed homes, washed away roadways, and even took lives. Out \nof this ruin came the challenge of rebuilding and piecing together \nhomes, lives, and communities. As I visited the devastation in Western \nNorth Carolina, I found encouragement in the selfless hearts of North \nCarolinians who went to great lengths to help those struggling through \nthe wreckage left behind. There are many who came together during this \ncrisis. I would especially like to thank the first responders who \nanswered the call of duty. Our first responders are there for us in \ntimes of need, and they literally are on the front lines defending our \nhomeland.\n  On November 21, 2004, the Town of Clyde and the Town of Canton are \nhonoring all those who were involved in the rescue and emergency \noperations following the devastation which occurred as a result of the \nhurricane season. November 21, 2004, has officially been declared by \nthose towns as ``Haywood County Emergency Operations Appreciation \nDay.''\n  I would like to commend the efforts of these men and women who are \nmembers of the following departments who brought the community together \nafter such devastation: Haywood County Sheriffs Department, North \nCarolina Highway Patrol, North Carolina Probation and Parole, North \nCarolina Alcohol Law Enforcement, North Carolina Division of Motor \nVehicles, Waynesville Police Department, Canton Police Department, \nMaggie Valley Police Department, Haywood County Emergency Management, \nWaynesville Fire Department, Cruso Volunteer Department, Clyde Fire \nDepartment, North Carolina National Guard, Canton Fire Department, \nNorth Canton Fire Department, Maggie Valley Fire Department, Lake \nJunaluska Fire Department, Crabtree Fire Department, Fines Creek Fire \nDepartment, Jonathan Creek Fire Department, Saunooke\n\n[[Page S11484]]\n\nFire Department, Center Pigeon Volunteer Fire Department, Lake Logan \nFire Department, Enka/Candler Fire Department, Haywood County Rescue \nSquad, Haywod County EMS, Blue Ridge Paper Emergency Response Team and \nClyde Police Department.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/18/senate-section/article/S11484-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11484]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        TRIBUTE TO THE SOUTH DAKOTA STAFF OF SENATOR TOM DASCHLE\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON.

I join my \ncolleagues in providing the most heartfelt appreciation for the public \nservice career of Senator Daschle and that appreciation extends to the \nwork of his South Dakota staff.\n  The people of South Dakota have benefitted greatly over the years \nfrom the work of Senator Daschle's staff. These men and women worked \ntirelessly behind the scenes on behalf of South Dakota constituents. \nThey served as the eyes and ears for Senator Daschle, maintaining \ncontacts in South Dakota communities, attending meetings on projects \nand sitting down with individual constituents to discuss matters of \nimportance.\n  Some of Senator Daschle's staff provided over two decades of \ndedicated service to the people of South Dakota. Their long hours of \nservice, many of them spent driving on country roads, sitting in coffee \nshops or walking through drought-stricken corn and wheat fields, \nunderscored Senator Daschle's commitment to serve the people of South \nDakota.\n  Senator Daschle's South Dakota staff truly reflect the tireless work \nethic, dedication, and professionalism that he has exemplified to all \nthe citizens of our state. Whether attending economic development \noutreach meetings, sacrificing holidays and weekends to travel with \nSenator Daschle across South Dakota, or tending to the many casework \nissues facing our constituents, Senator Daschle's South Dakota staff \nhas done a superb job.\n  It is my hope that these valued members of Senator Daschle's South \nDakota staff recognize the importance of their work and the great \nappreciation that many in South Dakota hold for them for their great \nservice.\n  Senator Daschle's current South Dakota staff includes:\n  Beth Smith, Betty Daschle, Jody Jordan, Maeve King, and Virginia \nNewquist in the Aberdeen office; Ace Crawford, Armon Gaddy, Dorothy \nChristensen, Jackie Heier, Georgeann Johnson, Rose Larson, and Sheila \nLane in the Rapid City office; Bill Idema, Gene Dwyer, Jeff Wilka, Jenn \nDolan, Mark Gerhardt, Mary Peters, Michele Seaton, Nicole Deak, \nStephanie Devitt, Stephanie Koster Hoyme, Steve Dick, and Steve \nErpenbach, Senator Daschle's State director, in the Sioux Falls office.\n  The work of Senator Daschle and his staff will be remembered by South \nDakotans for many years to come.

Senator Daschle's staff \ntruly reflect the tireless work ethic, dedication, and professionalism \nthat he has exemplified to all the citizens of our State.\n  While each and every member of Senator Daschle's staff is dedicated, \ncommitted, and hard working, I think three long-serving members of his \nWashington staff should be recognized separately. Those senior staff \nmembers are Pete Rouse, who served in Senator Daschle's leadership \noffice as chief of staff, Nancy Erickson, his deputy chief of staff in \nthe Capitol, and Laura Petrou, the chief of staff in his personal \noffice.

Daschle\n\n       Whereas, Senator Tom Daschle has distinguished himself as \n     more than a reliable friend to South Dakota Farmers Union and \n     the cause of family-based agriculture, but more so as a true \n     hero to our cause; and,\n       Whereas, Senator Daschle performed his duties faithfully to \n     better the lives and opportunities of all South Dakotans, and \n     conducted exemplary public service to South Dakotans with the \n     assistance of his highly resourceful, talented and dedicated \n     staff in his offices in Washington, D.C., Sioux Falls, Rapid \n     City and Aberdeen; and,\n       Whereas, Senator Daschle championed the cause of ethanol \n     since his first campaign for the U.S. Congress, and is \n     chiefly responsible for its emergence as America's answer to \n     energy independence because of his relentless pursuit of \n     government support for its production and marketing; and\n       Whereas, Senator Daschle earned his reputation as America's \n     most important Member of Congress for the advancement of \n     legislation important to South Dakota Farmers Union, the \n     National Farmers Union and family-based agriculture because \n     of his sincere interest in promoting America's rural economy \n     and because of his generous nature and approachability to all \n     citizens seeking his assistance in Washington, D.C.; and\n       Whereas, Senator Daschle wisely used his influence and \n     leadership powers to the benefit of South Dakota, resulting \n     in unprecedented cooperation from urban states to help\n\n[[Page S11485]]\n\n     advance the causes and unique, critical needs of rural states \n     and agriculture in the form of federal funds and programs for \n     agriculture, disaster aid, health care, education, energy \n     needs, air transportation, highway maintenance, railways and \n     water development; and\n       Whereas, Senator Daschle's powerful resources and status as \n     Senate Majority Leader and Senate Minority Leader gave South \n     Dakota unprecedented influence to pass legislation which was \n     of the greatest benefit to all South Dakotans, especially to \n     rural communities, farms and ranches; and,\n       Whereas, Senator Daschle was responsible for the allocation \n     of unprecedented federal funds to South Dakota throughout his \n     tenure in the United States Congress, and that Senator \n     Daschle's last term ended with victories for South Dakota, \n     including his quest to produce $2.9 billion in disaster \n     assistance for farmers and ranchers, against the longstanding \n     resistance and indifference of the majority party in Congress \n     and the White House; and,\n       Whereas, Senator Daschle's great influence and power on \n     behalf of South Dakota and rural America will be missed in \n     the unfinished battles for a Renewable Fuels Standard, a \n     mandatory Country of Origin Labeling law, fair trade policies \n     which are not predatory to South Dakota agriculture, \n     sufficient drought relief, rural water development and a \n     progressive agricultural agenda which supports a strong rural \n     economy, as well as the fights to preserve social security \n     and Medicare, lower prescription drug costs, and make health \n     care coverage affordable and available to all Americans;\n       Now, therefore, we resolve that the Delegates of the 89th \n     Convention of South Dakota Farmers Union commends and highly \n     appreciates the lifetime dedication and service of Senator \n     Thomas A. Daschle to improve the economy and the quality of \n     life in South Dakota and throughout the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/18/senate-section/article/S11485-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11485]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TROUBLING SITUATION IN COTE D'IVOIRE\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I express my concerns about the \ntroubling situation in Cote d'Ivoire.\n  As my colleagues know, in September 2002, rebellion broke out in Cote \nd'Ivoire, eventually dividing the country between the north, where \nrebels known as the Force Nouvelle established themselves, and the \nsouth, where President Laurent Gbagbo's government continued to \nexercise its authority. The Economic Community of West African states, \nor ECOWAS, helped to negotiate a ceasefire, and in January 2003 \ninternational efforts to mediate the crisis culminated in the signing \nof the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement of early 2003, which provided for an \ninterim Government of National Reconciliation to move the country \ntoward new elections. The United Nations established a peacekeeping \nmission and over 6,000 troops from around the world deployed to monitor \nthe ceasefire and help the parties implement the peace accord--further \nevidence of international will to help the people of Cote d'Ivoire \nregain a stable footing and reestablish a just and peaceful unified \ngovernment.\n  Throughout these diplomatic efforts, 4,000 French soldiers have \nserved as the backbone of the international presence that has worked to \nguarantee the peace. Much as the United Kingdom played a pivotal role \nin stabilizing Sierra Leone, France made an admirable commitment to the \npeople of Cote d'Ivoire. And despite the friction between France and \nthe U.S. on other important global issues, we have continued to work \nclosely and cooperatively to resolve this crisis.\n  But over the many months that have passed since the Linas-Marcoussis \nAgreement was signed, progress toward implementing the accords has \nstalled, as both parties failed to take constructive steps to move the \ncountry toward lasting stability. Then, on November 4, President Gbagbo \nbroke the ceasefire agreement, and in an apparent bid to find a \nmilitary solution, launched air raids on rebel positions in the north. \nOn November 6, the Ivorian forces bombed a French position, killing \nnine French soldiers and an American aid worker, and wounding dozens \nmore. France retaliated by destroying the Ivorian air force. What \nfollowed was an orchestrated campaign, conducted largely via broadcasts \non state-controlled media outlets, to encourage citizens to participate \nin a rampage of anti-French violence and looting.\n  I am heartened by the unity and resolve of the international \ncommunity in confronting this crisis, and by the rejection of Ivorian \nefforts to justify the bombings and to vilify France. U.N. peacekeepers \nperformed bravely in trying to protect the zone of confidence during \nthe recent hostilities. South African President Thabo Mbeki moved \nquickly to reach out to all parties and open the door to dialogue that \ncould diffuse the situation, though sadly, his efforts were not \nembraced by all parties. On November 15, the United Nations Security \nCouncil unanimously adopted a resolution establishing an arms embargo \non Cote d'Ivoire, and indicating that a travel ban and asset freeze \nwill be applied to anyone from among the government or rebel ranks \nfound to be an impediment to progress on implementing the peace \naccords. I welcome this resolution and its insistence on accountability \nfrom all parties to Cote d'Ivoire's conflict.\n  In addition to accountable, constructive leadership, there is a \ndesperate need for grassroots reconciliation efforts. The tensions that \ncame to a boil in 2002 have, sadly, been simmering for some time. In \nthe 1990s, some pursued a deliberate effort to promote a divisive, \ndestructive, xenophobic brand of nationalism in the country, and if a \nlasting peace is to take hold and the people of Cote d'Ivoire are to be \nfree from fear of a return to violence and chaos, a great deal of work \nmust be done to lessen ethnic tensions and build confidence and trust \nin Ivorian communities. In recent days, French nationals have been the \ntargets of ugly invective, but in the recent past it has been northern \nIvorians, immigrants, and Muslims who have been demonized. I urge the \nadministration to make combating ethnic and regional divisions a major \nfocus of U.S. efforts in Cote d'Ivoire. Even as we work with the \ninternational community to hold leaders accountable for their actions, \nwe must also assist in laying the groundwork for peace among the people \nthemselves.\n  The downward spiral in Cote d'Ivoire is especially troubling because \nthe country had, not long ago, been a beacon of stability and important \neconomic engine in a deeply troubled region. After all of the suffering \nin Sierra Leone and Liberia, and all of the costly efforts launched to \nbring stability back to West Africa, the international community cannot \nafford to lose Cote d'Ivoire to perpetual crisis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/18/senate-section/article/S11485-2", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11485-S11486]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              PROBLEMS IN THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to express my concern over \nrecent news reports detailing turmoil inside the Central Intelligence \nAgency since the arrival of the new Director, Porter Goss, and former \nmembers of his staff in the House of Representatives.\n  As a senior member of the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs \nwith oversight responsibility for homeland security and the committee \nresponsible for drafting the legislative reform on intelligence now in \nconference, I am deeply concerned about the impact the new leadership \nat the CIA may have on our national security.\n  Since the terrorist attacks against the United States on September \n11, 2001, the Congress has been engaged as never before in efforts to \nreform our intelligence collection capability in terms of our ability \nto improve the technical means to collect and share critical \ninformation in a timely fashion. The key component to that reform is \nhuman capital. Time and time again in outside commissions, reports to \nthe Congress, and in hearings, we have been told that our intelligence \nand law enforcement communities lack sufficient qualified personnel to \ncollect and analyze information. I introduced legislation, S. 589, the \nHomeland Security Federal Workforce Act, which passed the Senate with \nbipartisan support last year and is now in the House, to help rectify \nthat problem. Other Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle have \nalso introduced legislation to improve our intelligence and law \nenforcement workforce.\n  This is why I am so disturbed by the news reports that senior members \nof the CIA are being forced to resign, are being pressured to fire \nsubordinates, and there are fears that they may even be asked to tailor \ntheir analysis to support the administration's policies, according to \nthe November 17, 2004, New York Times. I ask unanimous consent that the \narticle be printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S11486]]\n\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. AKAKA. Among those who have been forced out or retired recently \nare the Deputy Director of the CIA, the Deputy Director of Operations, \nthe second ranking member of the clandestine service, and the former \nhead of the CIA bin Laden unit. Other resignations, retirements, or \nreassignments may follow.\n  Apparently, Director Goss brought with him at least 4 former staffers \nfrom the House of Representatives and inserted them into senior \npositions at the agency where they have begun to force these \nresignations.\n  This is troubling for two reasons: First, we cannot afford to lose \nany intelligence personnel, especially seasoned officers, in the midst \nof the war on terrorism. We have so few people we cannot fully staff \nthe Terrorist Threat Integration Center, TTIC, that the President \ncreated to provide a coordinated counterterrorism response to the 9/11 \nattacks. Secondly, our intelligence staff have been working 24/7 since \nthe war on terrorism and the war in Iraq began. They need morale \nboosters, not the morale downers that come from the forced resignations \nof well-respected leaders.\n  So desperate is the personnel situation that the intelligence reform \nbill, S. 2845, now in conference, authorizes the establishment of a \nNational Intelligence Reserve Corps for the temporary reemployment of \nformer intelligence community employees during periods of emergency.\n  Some would argue that the CIA is a ``damaged agency'' that needs to \nbe reformed through ``hard love.'' Perhaps that is the case. Perhaps \nthe operations directorate needs to be given new direction. I \nunderstand that both President Clinton and President Bush, in his first \nterm, were focused on reforming the clandestine operations through the \nefforts of Director Tenet and that those reforms were yielding results. \nBut if those results are insufficient, more needs to be done.\n  If a ship needs to change course and requires a new crew, the new \ncrew needs to knows both how to pilot a ship and how to plot a course. \nSo far, the current upheaval at the Central Intelligence Agency makes \nme worry that the current new crew may not measure up to that \nchallenge. I would like to be proved wrong because our national \nsecurity depends on it.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the New York Times, Nov. 17, 2004]\n\n     New C.I.A. Chief Tells Workers To Back Administration Policies\n\n                           (By Douglas Jehl)\n\n       Washington, Nov. 16.--Porter J. Goss, the new intelligence \n     chief, has told Central Intelligence Agency employees that \n     their job is to ``support the administration and its policies \n     in our work,'' a copy of an internal memorandum shows.\n       ``As agency employees we do not identify with, support or \n     champion opposition to the administration or its policies,'' \n     Mr. Goss said in the memorandum, which was circulated late on \n     Monday. He said in the document that he was seeking ``to \n     clarify beyond doubt the rules of the road.''\n       While his words could be construed as urging analysts to \n     conform with administration policies, Mr. Goss also wrote, \n     ``We provide the intelligence as we see it--and let the facts \n     alone speak to the policymaker.''\n       The memorandum suggested an effort by Mr. Goss to spell out \n     his thinking as he embarked on what he made clear would be a \n     major overhaul at the agency, with further changes to come. \n     The changes to date, including the ouster of the agency's \n     clandestine service chief, have left current and former \n     intelligence officials angry and unnerved. Some have been \n     outspoken, including those who said Tuesday that they \n     regarded Mr. Goss's warning as part of an effort to suppress \n     dissent within the organization.\n       In recent weeks, White House officials have complained that \n     some C.I.A. officials have sought to undermine President Bush \n     and his policies.\n       At a minimum, Mr. Goss's memorandum appeared to be a swipe \n     against an agency decision under George J. Tenet, his \n     predecessor as director of central intelligence, to permit a \n     senior analyst at the agency, Michael Scheuer, to write a \n     book and grant interviews that were critical of the Bush \n     administration's policies on terrorism.\n       One former intelligence official said he saw nothing \n     inappropriate in Mr. Goss's warning, noting that the C.I.A. \n     had long tried to distance itself and its employees from \n     policy matters.\n       ``Mike exploited a seam in the rules and inappropriately \n     used it to express his own policy views,'' the official said \n     of Mr. Scheuer. ``That did serious damage to the agency, \n     because many people, including some in the White House, \n     thought that he was being urged by the agency to take on the \n     president. I know that was not the case.''\n       But a second former intelligence official said he was \n     concerned that the memorandum and the changes represented an \n     effort by Mr. Goss to stifle independence.\n       ``If Goss is asking people to color their views and be a \n     team player, that's not what people at C.I.A. signed up \n     for,'' said the former intelligence official. The official \n     and others interviewed in recent days spoke on condition that \n     they not be named, saying they did not want to inflame \n     tensions at the agency.\n       Some of the contents of Mr. Goss's memorandum were first \n     reported by The Washington Post. A complete copy of the \n     document was obtained on Tuesday by The New York Times.\n       Tensions between the agency's new leadership team, which \n     took over in late September, and senior career officials are \n     more intense than at any time since the late 1970's. The most \n     significant changes so far have been the resignations on \n     Monday of Stephen R. Kappes, the deputy director of \n     operations, and his deputy, Michael Sulick, but Mr. Goss told \n     agency employees in the memorandum that he planned further \n     changes ``in the days and weeks ahead of us'' that would \n     involve ``procedures, organization, senior personnel and \n     areas of focus for our action.''\n       ``I am committed to sharing these changes with you as they \n     occur,'' Mr. Goss said in the memorandum. ``I do understand \n     it is easy to be distracted by both the nature and the pace \n     of change. I am confident, however, that you will remain \n     deeply committed to our mission.''\n       Mr. Goss's memorandum included a reminder that C.I.A. \n     employees should ``scrupulously honor our secrecy oath'' by \n     allowing the agency's public affairs office and its \n     Congressional relations branch to take the lead in all \n     contacts with the media and with Congress. ``We remain a \n     secret organization,'' he said.\n       Among the moves that Mr. Goss said he was weighing was the \n     selection of a candidate to become the agency's No. 2 \n     official, the deputy director of central intelligence. The \n     name being mentioned most often within the C.I.A. as a \n     candidate, intelligence officials said, is Lt. Gen. Michael \n     V. Hayden of the Air Force, the director of the National \n     Security Agency, which is responsible for intercepting \n     electronic communications worldwide. The naming of a deputy \n     director would be made by the White House, in a nomination \n     subject to Senate confirmation.\n       In interviews this week, members of Congress as well as \n     current and former intelligence officials said one reason the \n     overhaul under way had left them unnerved was that Mr. Goss \n     had not made clear what kind of agency he intended to put in \n     place. But Mr. Goss's memorandum did little to spell out that \n     vision, and it did not make clear why the focus of overhaul \n     efforts to date appeared to be on the operations directorate, \n     which carries out spying and other covert missions around the \n     world.\n       ``It's just very hard to divine what's going on over \n     there,'' said Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, who said \n     he and other members of the Senate intelligence committee \n     would be seeking answers at closed sessions this week. ``But \n     on issue after issue, there's a real question about whether \n     the country and the Congress are going to get an unvarnished \n     picture of our intelligence situation at a critical time.''\n       Mr. Goss said in the memorandum that he recognized that \n     intelligence officers were operating in an atmosphere of \n     extraordinary pressures, after a series of reports critical \n     of intelligence agencies' performance in the months leading \n     up to the Sept. 11 attacks and the war in Iraq.\n       ``The I.C. and its people have been relentlessly \n     scrutinized and criticized,'' he said, using an abbreviation \n     for intelligence community. ``Intelligence-related issues \n     have become the fodder of partisan food fights and turf-power \n     skirmishes. All the while, the demand for our services and \n     products against a ruthless and unconventional enemy has \n     expanded geometrically and we are expected to deliver--\n     instantly. We have reason to be proud of our achievements and \n     we need to be smarter about how we do our work in this \n     operational climate.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/18/senate-section/article/S11486-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11486-S11487]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LIFTING HOLD ON NOMINATION OF DEBORAH MAJORAS\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, last May, I announced my intention to \nobject to any unanimous consent request for the Senate to take up the \nnomination of Deborah Majoras to be the Chair of the Federal Trade \nCommission, FTC. I did so because despite several requests, I had \nreceived no assurance from Ms. Majoras that under her leadership, the \nFTC would take any steps to address anticompetitive practices that \ndrive up gasoline prices nationwide and particularly in the Pacific \nNorthwest. Oregon consumers typically pay some of the highest gasoline \nprices in the Nation.\n  Today, I received a letter from Ms. Majoras describing how she is \nmoving forward on certain commitments she made to me concerning the \nFTC's policies for the oil and gasoline industry.\n\n[[Page S11487]]\n\nIn particular, she committed to consult with outside experts to get to \nthe bottom of the differences between the Government Accountability \nOffice, GAO, and the FTC on the impacts of the FTC oil merger policies \non gasoline prices. Ms. Majoras' letter states that she is working to \ndo this by conducting a public review of the GAO report on the Effects \nof Mergers and Market Concentration in the U.S. Petroleum Industry. \nFollowing that review, Ms. Majoras also promises to share her views \nwith me on the GAO report.\n  Ms. Majoras' letter indicates she is making a good-faith effort to \ntake a fresh look at the issues raised by the GAO report. In light of \nthis and the other actions Ms. Majoras has initiated to get to the \nbottom of the reasons why consumers in my part of the country are \npaying such high gasoline prices, I will no longer object to any \nunanimous consent request for the Senate to take up Ms. Majoras' \nnomination. I will, however, continue to closely monitor the FTC \nactions under Ms. Majoras' leadership to ensure gasoline consumers are \nnot overpaying at the pump.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this statement along with Ms. \nMajoras' letter be printed in the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     Federal Trade Commission,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 18, 2004.\n     Hon. Ron Wyden,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Wyden, In response to your recent inquiries, I \n     want to assure you that I am working to implement the actions \n     that I laid out in my letter of June 10, 2004. For example, \n     we are working on the public review by outside economic \n     experts of the findings in the GAO Report, Energy Markets: \n     Effects of Mergers and Market Concentration in the U.S. \n     Petroleum Industry and the criticisms of that report. As you \n     know, it is common for economists to submit their work for \n     peer review and discussion, and I believe that such an \n     assessment would be useful. Given your interest in the \n     report, I plan to share my views with you about the findings \n     and conclusions of this public discussion once we have \n     completed that process.\n       Here at the FTC, we are working at full throttle to protect \n     American consumers; I look forward to working cooperatively \n     with the Congress in the coming session on these efforts.\n           Sincerely,\n     Deborah Platt Majoras.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/18/senate-section/article/S11487-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11487]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     COMMENDING SECRETARY POWELL AND STATE DEPARTMENT ON MANAGING \n       INTERNATIONAL GOVERNMENTAL RELATIONS FOR U.S. TERRITORIES\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, as our colleagues on the Senate Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee will attest, it takes years of experience \nto understand some of the nuances of Federal law and policy applicable \nin American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands and \nthe U.S. Virgin Islands. Yet, our current Secretary of State has shown \nremarkable knowledge of the sometimes complex issues arising from \nofficial international activities of local territorial governments.\n  In responding to international issues arising from Federal-\nterritorial relations in the case of Puerto Rico, Secretary Powell has \narticulated sound principles that are relevant to Federal policy with \nrespect to the other territories as well. Specifically, the record \nshould reflect the success of measures adopted by the Department of \nState to ensure that local government officials in the Commonwealth of \nPuerto Rico do not take official actions inconsistent with the \nreservation of foreign relations powers to the federal government under \nthe U.S. Constitution.\n  The Department of State has tried to show flexibility and include \nterritories in international programs and activities when appropriate, \nas it does in the case of other domestic political subdivisions. \nHowever, Department of State oversight and regulation of all official \ninternational activities by local territorial governments is necessary \nto preserve the constitutional allocation of powers within the U.S. \nFederal system, especially as it relates to administration of \nterritories with a political status defined by Federal statute rather \nthan the U.S. Constitution itself. In the case of Puerto Rico, Federal \nauthority in all official international matters is consistent with the \nPuerto Rico Federal Relations Act (64 State. 319), and required by the \nstatus of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico as a territory subject to the \nauthority of Congress under Article IV, Section 3, Clause 2 of the U.S. \nConstitution. All powers of the local government remain subject to the \nsupremacy of Federal law.\n  The Department of State acted in the national interest and in the \nbest long-term interest of our fellow citizens in Puerto Rico by not \nacquiescing in actions by U.S. citizen officials of the local \ngovernment seeking international recognition and treatment for Puerto \nRico that are reserved for sovereign nations. The Department must \ncontinue to adhere to the simple rule that the Commonwealth should not \nbe permitted to act officially in the international sphere in a manner \nthat would not be permitted for other political subdivisions, whether \nState, county, city or territorial, unless otherwise specifically \nprovided by Congress.\n  By confirming the correct application of Federal law and policy in \nhis cable to our embassies, Secretary Powell has given diplomatic \nexpression to the principles of federalism that apply to Puerto Rico \nand other U.S. territories. This ``Powell Doctrine'', if you will, ends \nthe ambivalence and ambiguity that have existed about these issues for \ntoo long. The Secretary of State applied the correct legal doctrine in \nthese matters, based on the principle that the Federal Government \nconducts the foreign policy of the United States and all its citizens, \nwhich includes the U.S. citizens of Puerto Rico under its current \nstatus.\n  The actions taken by the Department of State in this matter do not \naffect the process of self-determination as to the ultimate political \nstatus of Puerto Rico. Rather, this is a matter of confirming and in a \nproper manner implementing Federal powers and responsibilities beyond \nthe realm of local politics regarding the status of the territory, \nuntil informed self-determination recognized under Federal law and \npolicy leads to status resolution. Of course, neither local government \npowers nor the terms for political status resolution can be determined \nunilaterally by local law or political processes, because in each case \nFederal law is supreme and only changes in Federal law can change the \nstatus or define the extent that local governments can exercise \nsovereignty as to local matters.\n  For making these realities clear, and doing so in an impartial and \nentirely fair way, it is appropriate to commend our Secretary of State \nand the men and women of the U.S. State Department.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/18/senate-section/article/S11487-2", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11487]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           TRIBUTE TO INTERNS\n\n  Mr. HARKIN.

Professor of English Howard \nTinberg at Bristol Community College in Fall River was named an \nOutstanding Community College Professor of the Year, and Robert Bell, \nprofessor of English at Williams College in Williamstown, was\n\n[[Page S11488]]\n\nnamed an Outstanding Baccalaureate College Professor of the Year.\n  The awards were presented by the Council for Advancement and Support \nof Education and the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of \nTeaching. Four professors were recognized at each level of higher \neducation--community college, baccalaureate, masters, and doctoral/\nresearch--for their outstanding teaching, their commitment to \nundergraduate students and their contribution to teaching as a \nprofession.\n  Howard Tinberg teaches literature and composition, and is renowned \nfor involving his students in researching the use of literacy in \nfamilies and communities. He was instrumental in the establishment of \nthe Writing Center at Bristol Community College and the Center for \nTeaching and Learning on the campus. He also serves as editor of the \nnational journal. Teaching English in the Two-Year Colleges.\n  Robert Bell's approach to teaching is grounded in his personal \nconnections to his students and the exploration of literature through \nthe details of the author's language. In 1994, he founded a mentoring \nprogram for new faculty members, the Project for Effective Teaching, \nwhich brings teachers together for weekly discussions, symposia and \nconferences.\n  The Professors of the Year Program was created in 1981 and is the \nonly national program specifically designed to recognize excellence in \nundergraduate teaching and mentoring. This year's winners were selected \nfrom a pool of nearly 300 teachers nominated by their provosts and \nacademic vice presidents and supported by colleagues, former students, \nand current students.\n  Massachusetts is proud of the national recognition earned by these \ntwo distinguished educators who have dedicated their careers to \nimproving the learning and lives of their students and colleagues, and \nI congratulate them for their impressive leadership.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/18/senate-section/article/S11488-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11488-S11489]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        HONORING AKO ABDUL-SAMAD\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I would like to call my \ncolleagues' attention to the extraordinary work of one of my Iowa \nconstituents. This year, Ako Abdul-Samad, a Des Moines-based activist, \nreceived the prestigious 2004 National Caring Award for his work with \nat-risk youth in urban areas throughout Iowa. His organization, \nCreative Visions, was founded in 1996 after gang violence killed a \nyoung woman in suburban Des Moines. By working with both community \nleaders as well as gang leaders, Ako has helped many youth overcome \ntheir troubled past.\n  I am proud to call Ako Abdul-Samad not only a fellow Iowan, but also \na friend. Since 1996, his organization has aided countless Iowa youth. \nWithout his remarkable efforts and compassion, the urban areas of Iowa \nwould not be the same. His progressive vision of today's youth places a \npositive outlook not only for the youth of today, but also the youth of \nthe future.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the following magazine article be printed \nin the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                 [From the Caring Magazine, Dec., 2004]\n\n       In 1996, a young woman from an outlying suburb of Des \n     Moines, Iowa, was killed when caught in gang crossfire--a \n     tragedy frequently played out in all too many American cities \n     and towns. The community was outraged, and many people \n     approached local activist Ako Abdul-Samad and asked what \n     could be done. He replied, ``Let's talk with the kids you're \n     talking about. Let's hear what they need.''\n       And so Chuck Johnson, president and CEO of Pioneer Hi-Bred \n     and president of the Des Moines Chamber of Commerce, and Tom \n     Glenn of the Des Moines Labor Institute met with Abdul-Samad \n     for hours along with 14 of Des Moines' top gang leaders. Then \n     Abdul-Samad met with the gang members alone, discussing an \n     idea he had to build an organization to help at-risk youth.\n       Of the 14 gang leaders who showed up that day, six bought \n     into Abdul-Samad's idea. And thus Creative Visions was born. \n     The only thing the newly birthed organization asked of the \n     six gang members who stayed on was to stop all of their \n     illegal activity. ``We didn't ask them to denounce their gang \n     or to shed their gang colors,'' says Abdul-Samad. ``And for \n     two months we all worked out of my house--with members of the \n     Crips, Bloods, Gangsta Disciples, and Vice Lords coming and \n     going, much to my neighbors' wary curiosity.\n       ``After the two months, we met again with the president of \n     Pioneer Hi-Bred, among others. The gang members walked in \n     wearing their colors, and then shortly into the meeting they \n     all got up and walked out. I kept on talking, and it seemed \n     like they weren't coming back, so I began to apologize to the \n     president and attendees. Just then, all of them walked in \n     again dressed in business suits ready to give their \n     individual presentations. Tears streamed down my face.''\n       In the eight years that have since passed, only one of the \n     six original gang members who agreed to work with Abdul-Samad \n     returned to his former ways, and now even he is starting to \n     put his life back together again.\n       From that small but powerful beginning, Abdul-Samad \n     estimates that Creative Visions has probably taken more guns \n     and drugs off the street than any other organization in the \n     Midwest. Their secret? Very simple, really. Give the so-\n     called ``lost-to-the-streets'' youth and young adults a \n     customized, holistic program of self-development, and you \n     will see them transform into self-sufficient, productive \n     citizens. The seeds for Creative Visions were planted 15 \n     years before its formal founding. ``I had a contract to visit \n     and work in the prisons statewide,'' says Abdul-Samad. ``One \n     day I was in the intake center where all the prisoners come \n     once they are sentenced. I met a 16-year-old who was about to \n     serve an adult sentence, and before I left he asked me to \n     tell his dad and uncles when I saw them that he was OK. I \n     thought he meant when I got back to Des Moines to look them \n     up. But no, he said his dad was in one state prison and his \n     uncles were in another. Then I learned that all of them had \n     been to El Dora, a well-known boys' training school that \n     supposedly helped troubled youth avoid a life of crime. \n     Obviously, we were failing to turn young lives around.''\n       Abdul-Samad began to research the problem. He resigned his \n     prison contract and went to work for a Des Moines \n     organization called Urban Dreams, where he worked with kids \n     already at El Dora. ``But I wanted to catch the kids before \n     they got to that institution,'' explains Abdul-Samad. ``And I \n     was tired of hearing people say we can fix kids. You can't \n     `fix' a child or an adult. You can provide resources for them \n     to fix themselves because if the motivation to change doesn't \n     come from their own heart, it doesn't work.''\n       It was at that time that the young woman in Des Moines was \n     killed in the crossfire, providing a catalyst to test Abdul-\n     Samad's concept. ``With Creative Visions we showed the kids \n     we were willing to give them an opportunity,'' Abdul-Samad \n     affirms. ``We gave them a new family to belong to. We gave \n     them an opportunity to have a building--that gave them \n     ownership because they put the graffiti on the walls. Every \n     young person who was here in 1996 was involved in all aspects \n     of Creative Visions. We didn't do one program without their \n     input. We would do focus groups until we got it right. And \n     they saw me walking the talk.''\n       And then came 1997 and a personal tragedy that tested \n     Abdul-Samad's faith and ability to continue to ``walk the \n     talk.'' In December his only son, ``Little Ako,'' was shot to \n     death by a young man named Rodney. ``When I went to the \n     hospital, it was full of young people waiting to see what I \n     would do,'' Abdul-Samad recalls. ``The police declared it \n     an accidental shooting. My family wanted me to press \n     charges and send the killer to jail. And the gang members \n     wanted to kill Rodney. I will tell you now that the walk \n     became very difficult for me. I worked hard at just trying \n     to think straight. Sometimes I wouldn't know what I was \n     doing.\n       ``I prayed for guidance. Within a week, I called a press \n     conference and had Rodney and his mother there. And I forgave \n     Rodney in public. I said that I've already lost my son and \n     that it would do no good to lose another young man. I said if \n     I could forgive him, who had the right not to? And then I \n     took Rodney home with me for the next four or five days.\n       ``I think this is what the fate of Creative Visions, \n     because the kids and young adults now saw me walk the talk \n     despite my personal pain. They saw I was willing to keep on \n     giving, no matter what it cost. And not only me. There was \n     another staff person whose son was shot and killed in a \n     street not far from our office. The kids could see that there \n     are people who work here that are in pain, but they keep on \n     going.'' Lest one label Abdul-Samad and his co-workers ``role \n     models,'' he is quick to correct the term: ``We don't use the \n     term `role model;' we use `goal model.' Too many times we put \n     our role models upon pedestals; we don't allow them to be \n     human, which hinders their giving. We think a `goal model' \n     allows someone to make mistakes, to learn from those \n     mistakes, and to grow. As goal models we `model' setting \n     goals, striving to reach those goals, and making those goals \n     a reality.''\n       Certainly part of what makes Creative Visions work is its \n     peer counselors--some of whom are former gang members, drug \n     addicts, and dealers themselves. They are especially able to \n     form trusting relationship with young people who know they \n     have ``been there, done that.''\n       Like many dedicated to a life of service, Abdul-Samad's \n     reward is not accolades. ``A reward is when a young street \n     person, whom everyone else had given up on, goes through our \n     program and then walks in the door one day and shows you \n     their diploma, or tells you they've gone back to school, or \n     shares\n\n[[Page S11489]]\n\n     the career path they've chose to pursue. Nothing is more \n     rewarding than to watch someone who is struggling and wearing \n     a look of despair suddenly transform. You can begin to see \n     hope in their eyes and the beginning of a smile.''\n       There are many aspects of inner-city life that are not \n     pretty. Abdul-Samad and his co-workers come face to face with \n     often grim and gritty circumstances that most people would \n     not want to even hear about, much less confront. Teen \n     pregnancies, venereal diseases, drug overdoses, stabbings, \n     are all part of the realities Creative Visions' counselors \n     face each day. Abdul-Samad credits his relationship with God \n     with helping him get through his pain. He also copes through \n     the pen--often writing poetry at 3 a.m., which relaxes him \n     and had led to the release of his first book, A Deeper Truth/\n     Relevations From the Soul.\n       Abdul-Samad has spent most of his 53 years giving to \n     others. Even as a child he tended to wounded animals or fixed \n     broken bicycles and then gave them away to neighborhood kids. \n     By the time he was 18, he was aligned with an organization \n     that fed 300 children each morning--long before the school \n     system began offering free breakfasts. ``This was all during \n     the 1960s, a good time in which to have grown up because of \n     all the consciousness-raising going on--women's rights, civil \n     rights, human rights,'' says Abdul-Samad. ``Anyone young who \n     got caught up in the counter-culture movement at that time \n     couldn't help but identify with people who were struggling.''\n       After eight years, the vision Ako Abdul-Samad conceived and \n     built is flourishing. Almost two dozen programs are now \n     operating through his center, from computer classes to 12-\n     step meetings. Since its inception, Creative Visions has \n     attracted and helped more than 6,500 men, women, and at-risk \n     children and youth. Now calls are coming in from cities \n     around the United States--and other countries including \n     Mexico, the Netherlands, and Nigeria--also interested in \n     starting similar organizations.\n       Abdul-Samad knows that many of the battles he undertakes \n     won't be won in his lifetime. But his philosophy is to plant \n     a seed, and he has planted many.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/18/senate-section/article/S11489-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11489]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REVEREND CECIL WILLIAMS\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I wish to recognize and share with \nmy colleagues the compassion and dedication of Reverend Cecil Williams \nin honor of his 40 years of community service to the San Francisco \ncommunity.\n  Reverend Williams has been Pastor of San Francisco's Glide Memorial \nChurch since the early 1960s. He has built a community congregation of \nover 10,000 members and is recognized as a national leader on the \nleading edge of social change.\n  Reverend Williams has led Glide Memorial Church to be a political \nvoice for equal rights and a safe haven for the oppressed. His \ncongregation has lent its support to those who speak out on national \nissues of importance, such as the Vietnam war, nuclear weapon \ndevelopment, affirmative action and HIV/AIDS prevention.\n  When Reverend Williams joined Glide Memorial Church in the 1960s, he \ntransformed it into a sacred space that honors diversity, expression, \nand the celebration of life.\n  I would like to share a couple examples of Reverend Williams' \ntremendous work. In the 1960s, Reverend Williams launched a free meal \nprogram at Glide that expanded in the 1980s to providing three meals a \nday to the hungry and homeless. The program currently serves over 1 \nmillion meals a year to members of the larger San Francisco community.\n  In the 1990s, feeling the need to reach out to those involved in drug \nabuse, Reverend Williams took his message against drugs into the \ncommunity, using a bullhorn in front of housing projects to call \naddicts and dealers out to recovery.\n  As Reverend Williams begins his 40th year at Glide Memorial Church, \nhe is now serving as Glide's CEO and Minister of National and \nInternational Ministries. He continues to bring forth new ideas on how \nto battle the problems inflicting the San Francisco community, \nincluding poverty, drug abuse, violence and despair. He is a respected \nand revered leader who brings together people searching for acceptance, \nsocial justice and spiritual growth.\n  I hope you will all join me in celebrating the remarkable service of \nReverend Cecil Williams for the past 40 years at Glide Memorial Church. \nI wish him many more years of rewarding experiences to the San \nFrancisco community and beyond.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/18/senate-section/article/S11489-2", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11489]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       IN TRIBUTE TO RHODE ISLAND BROADCASTING LEGEND SALTY BRINE\n\n Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I want to pay tribute to a great \nRhode Islander who passed away on Election Day: Walter L ``Salty'' \nBrine.\n  Salty Brine was a local broadcasting legend one might even say he was \nthe voice of Rhode Island. For half a century, he hosted the morning \nprogram on WPRO-AM. It was Salty's voice that thrilled three \ngenerations of schoolchildren on snowy mornings with the announcement, \n``No school, Foster-Glocester!''\n  Salty's show was the soundtrack of a Rhode Island morning. The sound \nof his voice conjures up the following scene: It is dark outside, a \nbowl of steaming oatmeal is on the kitchen table, there is a mad \nscramble to locate a missing mitten before the school bus arrives.\n  Salty would preside over the recounting of the news and the weather. \nHis wife Mickie would call in and give a report on what birds were at \nthe birdfeeder. We would be on the edges of our seats waiting for him \nto say our school was closed. I suppose it is fair to say that Rhode \nIslanders associate Salty Brine with that singular elation aroused by a \nsnow day. Salty was the ultimate bearer of good news.\n  Of course, Salty's career encompassed much more than reading the \nrollcall of school closures. From 1958 to 1968, he hosted a children's \ntelevision program called ``Salty Brine's Shack,'' which costarred his \ncollie Jack and ended reliably with the admonition, ``Brush your teeth \nand say your prayers!'' Having lost a leg in a train accident when he \nwas a boy, Salty was a firm support and wonderful example for \nyoungsters who were coping with a similar disability. Salty would \ndemonstrate how the loss of a limb really would not set them back one \nbit.\n  Many charitable endeavors benefited from Salty's talent, energy, and \ngood name. He was especially involved in the Big Brothers of Rhode \nIsland, the Muscular Dystrophy Association, and was a board member, \nappropriately enough, of Save the Bay. Cardi's Furniture for whom he \nhad recorded a trademark commercial--honored Salty for his service to \nour community just last year.\n  Born in 1918, Salty's life was framed by Red Sox World Series \nvictories. This is entirely appropriate, as Salty was an ardent and \ndevoted fan and even had aspired to be a ball player. Just last August, \non Rhode Island Day at Fenway Park, Salty Brine was given the well-\ndeserved honor of throwing out the first pitch.\n  Like the Big Blue Bug and Mr. Potato Head, Salty Brine, with his \nskipper's hat, was a Rhode Island icon, a one-of-a-kind and endearing \ninstitution that bound all Rhode Islanders together in a single fond \nexperience. He was so much a part of our landscape that the legislature \nrenamed a Narragansett State beach after him. The Salty Brine Beach \nendures as a permanent affirmation of our affection for our Salty.\n  Salty Brine was married to his first wife, Marion, known to all as \nMickie, for 56 years. She died in 2000. He is survived by his wife, \nRoseanna, and his son Wally, who co-hosts the ``Loren & Wally Morning \nShow'' on WROR-FM in Boston.\n  Rhode Island will miss him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/18/senate-section/article/S11489-3", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11489-S11490]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RETIREMENT OF VEE BURKE\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER.

She has demonstrated an enormous capacity for public \nservice and tremendous insight on social policy. In over 30 years \nworking for the CRS, Vee has proven herself to be a true expert in the \nfield of public welfare.\n  Through her hard work and dedication, Vee has provided background \nreports and thoughtful analysis of low-income programs, especially \nwelfare reform. Members need timely and clear information in order to \nmake informed policy decisions. Vee has provided such information for \nmany years. Her ability to immerse herself in the specific details of \neach program assured the completeness of her reports, and her \nconsistent presence from one year to the next was essential in \nmaintaining an overview of the larger welfare system that the \nindividual programs collectively represent.\n  At the end of this month, Vee will be retiring from CRS. While she \nwill be\n\n[[Page S11490]]\n\nmissed, she has certainly earned the right to move on to the next phase \nof her life. The legacy she leaves behind will be difficult to match. \nHaving been honored for her outstanding performance numerous times, it \nis clear that Ms. Burke has earned the respect of her colleagues within \nCRS, congressional Members and staff, and the larger research and \npolicy community as a whole. Though many of them will never know her \nname, her knowledge and commitment to public service has affected the \nlives of millions of Americans. It is with the deepest respect and \nadmiration that I thank Ms. Burke here today and wish her the best in \nall of her future ventures.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/18/senate-section/article/S11490-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11490]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 LEWIS AND CLARK NATIONAL HISTORIC PARK\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, today, on behalf of the residents of \nClatsop County, OR, I pay tribute to public servants who are usually \nreferred to here in the U.S. Senate as nameless and faceless \nbureaucrats. I express my gratitude to the dedicated staff of the \nNational Park Service staff at the newly designated Lewis and Clark \nNational Historic Park--in particular, the superintendent, Chip \nJenkins.\n  Fort Clatsop and the Lewis and Clark National Historic Park, which \nsits in the northwest corner of Oregon, serves as the exclamation mark \nto the Lewis and Clark expedition across this vast continent. \nEstablished in 1958, this unit of the national park system has grown to \nbe one of the most popular tourist attractions along the northern \nOregon Coast. For 46 years, this park has endeavored to tell the story \nof the Lewis and Clark Expedition and its impact on the settlement of \nthe Pacific Northwest.\n  In preparation for the upcoming Lewis and Clark Bicentennial \nfestivities, Chip Jenkins and his staff at the Fort have served as a \ndriving force in planning, facilitating and coordinating region-wide \nefforts to help tell the tale of Lewis and Clark in the great Pacific \nNorthwest. Along with many key members of the community, Chip's vision \nand leadership abilities have culminated in the recent passage of the \nLewis and Clark National Historical Park Designation Act, which brings \nseveral State parks from both Oregon and Washington in partnership with \nthe National Park Service to tell a comprehensive story of the Lewis \nand Clark experience at the mouth of the magnificent Columbia River. \nThis Act was recently signed into law by President Bush on October 30, \n2004.\n  Chip has made such an impact on the State of Oregon that the Oregon \nBusiness magazine recently named him one of Oregon's top 50 Great \nLeaders. Well known in his community for his role at Fort Clatsop, Chip \nstill finds time for involvement in other local organizations and \nefforts such as the Astoria Children's Museum.\n  Mr. President, I offer my words of appreciation for Chip Jenkins and \nhis staff at the Lewis and Clark National Historic Park for their \ndedication to the public good. With the peak of Lewis and Clark \nBicentennial celebrations coming in the summer of 2005, there is still \nmuch work to do. But I am confident that they will succeed and leave a \nlegacy lasting well beyond this season of celebration. While the public \nservants of our many Federal agencies are often faceless and nameless \nto us in Congress, they are considered friends and partners in the \ncommunities they serve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/18/senate-section/article/S11490-2", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11490-S11491]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     IN RECOGNITION OF RICHARD WOOD\n\n Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of \nRichard Wood, CEO of Wawa Inc., and to commend him and his company's \ncommitment and dedication to Delaware and surrounding States. As CEO of \nWawa, Richard Wood has instilled in his associates the wisdom to do the \nright thing, and this core value enables the company to place a high \npriority on local community involvement. I thank him for all that he \nand his associates have done to make Delaware a better place.\n  The company began in 1803 and was incorporated in 1865 as the \nMillville Manufacturing Company. Millville's owner, George Wood, lived \nin Philadelphia and brought his family to Wawa, a rural town in \nDelaware County, PA. The original house where his family lived had a \nred tile roof, and is now the site of Wawa's present headquarters, \nhence the name ``Red Roof'' for Wawa's corporate offices. In 1902, \nGeorge Wood took an interest in dairy farming and started a small milk \nprocessing plant in Wawa, specializing in the home delivery of milk. By \nthe 1960s, the grandson of George Wood, Grahame Wood, recognized the \nchanging economic trends and had the vision to expand by selling milk \nin convenience stores. In April 1964, the first Wawa Food Market was \nopened in Folsom, PA.\n  One of the founding principles of Wawa is a commitment to the local \ncommunities that they serve. Today Wawa's core value of ``people \nhelping people'' guides Wawa and its employees to give back to those in \nneed. Just some of Wawa's charitable causes include support for \nchildren's health, cancer research, AIDS research, domestic violence, \nheart disease and hunger. A few of the organizations benefiting from \nthe Good Neighbor program include: Food Bank of Delaware, Contact \nDelaware, AIDS Delaware, The United Way and The Salvation Army.\n  Wawa has made a tremendous difference in its efforts to raise funds \nto help eliminate Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. SIDS, the unexplained \ndeath of an apparently healthy infant, is the leading cause of death in \ninfants between one month and one year of age. This deadly syndrome has \nimpacted the lives of countless Delaware families.\n  Since 1997, Wawa and the CJ Foundation for SIDS have held Walk-a-\nThons on the second Sunday in September. Walks are held at 12 locations \nin their five trading areas: New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, \nMaryland, and Virginia. With the strong support of Wawa area managers, \nsupervisors and store personnel, Wawa has raised more than $1.5 million \nover the last 8 years. Not only have Wawa customers, vendors and \nassociates given generously of their time to make the SIDS walks an \nenormous success, but countless Wawa associates volunteer to work the \nphone banks in New York City each year for the benefit of the CJ \nFoundation for SIDS Radiothon. Howard Stoeckel, President, and Harry \nMcHugh, Senior Vice President, have both spoken on the Radiothon on \nbehalf of Wawa and their involvement in the fight against SIDS.\n  Money raised at the Wawa Walk-a-Thons is used to fund research to \nfind the cause of SIDS and to educate parents on how to reduce the risk \nof SIDS. Proceeds from the walks have helped volunteer grassroots SIDS \norganizations expand to regional professional non-profits. Thousands of \nfamilies have greatly benefited from the national ``Cribs For Kids'' \nprogram, which receives funding from the Wawa Walk-a-Thons. This \nprogram distributes cribs to low-income families to help them provide a \nsafe sleep environment for their babies.\n  Throughout all this, one steady influence has been the leadership of \nRichard Wood, Wawa's CEO, who leads by his example in defining Wawa's \nculture and values. Born and raised in Pennsylvania, Richard graduated \nin 1956 from St. Paul's School, Concord, NH. He went on to receive his \nB.S. in Commerce from the University of Virginia in 1961, and an LLB \nfrom the University of Pennsylvania Law School in 1964. After \ngraduating from law school, Mr. Wood served as a law clerk for one year \nin the Federal Court of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania for the \nHonorable Francis L. Van Dusen. He then joined the law firm of \nMontgomery, McCracken, Walker and Rhoads in Philadelphia, PA. In June \nof 1970, Mr. Wood joined Wawa, Inc. as General Counsel. He served in \nvarious capacities until becoming President in June 1977 and Chief \nExecutive Officer in January 1981. Richard and his wife Jean reside in \nWawa, PA.\n  Richard serves on several boards, including the Children's Hospital \nof Philadelphia, Greater Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce CEO Council \nfor Growth, Pardee Resources Company, and QuikTrip Corporation. He has \nserved as director for many organizations, including: Greater \nPhiladelphia First, CoreStates Bank, N.A., Sheetz, Inc., Convenience \nStore, Foundation for Education and Research, Globe Ticket Company, \nMillville Savings & Loan Association, Overbrook School for the Blind, \nThe Home of the Merciful Savior, The Philadelphia City Institute, \nPhiladelphia Charity Ball, Inc.,\n\n[[Page S11491]]\n\nCrime Prevention Association, Upland Country Day School, Board of \nManagers of the Assemblies and Ludwig Institute. Richard was also past \nBoard Chairman of the National Association of Convenience Stores, PQ \nCorporation, Riddle Memorial Hospital, and Gulph Mills Golf Club (past \nPresident).\n  Richard Wood will be retiring as Wawa's CEO at the end of 2004, and \nwill assume the position of Chairman of the Board of Wawa Inc. I rise \ntoday to recognize Richard Wood and thank him for his compassion and \nleadership, and for the tremendous contributions he and the associates \nat Wawa have made to Delaware. I thank them for their commitment to \nstrengthening all the communities that they serve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/18/senate-section/article/S11491-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11491]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           TERRY R. CARLSTROM\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I pay tribute today to Terry R. \nCarlstrom, a distinguished and respected steward of our Nation's \nnatural and cultural resources. Terry is retiring after more than four \ndecades of dedicated public service in the U.S. Department of the \nInterior, including 8 years as Director of the National Park Service's \nNational Capital Region. I want to extend my personal congratulations \nand thanks for his many years of service and contributions to \nprotecting and enhancing our national treasures.\n  Throughout his career, Terry has distinguished himself for his \nleadership and commitment to public service and to managing some of our \nNation's most precious natural and cultural resources. Beginning as a \nyoung forester at Bridger National Forest in Wyoming in the early \n1960s, Terry also served in the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the U.S. \nFish and Wildlife Service before joining the National Park Service in \n1972. He quickly advanced to positions in senior management in the \nNational Park Service including Chief of Planning for the Denver \nService Center Western Team and the Alaska Regional Office, Associate \nRegional Director for Professional Services in the National Capital \nRegion and, most recently, as Regional Director.\n  During his 22-year tenure in the National Capital Region, I had the \nopportunity to work closely with Terry and members of his staff on a \nnumber of National Park initiatives in the State of Maryland and the \nbroader Washington metropolitan region including land acquisitions at \nMonocacy Battlefield, the renovation of the Baltimore-Washington \nParkway, the restoration of historic structures in the C Canal \nNational Historical Park, at Fort Washington, and the restoration and \njoint management of Glen Echo Park in Montgomery County. Terry was also \nresponsible for the difficult task of overseeing the construction and \ndedication of the Franklin D. Roosevelt Memorial, the Korean Veteran \nWar Memorial, and the World War II Memorial, among other monuments. I \nknow firsthand the extraordinary leadership and expertise Terry brought \nnot only to the National Parks and Monuments in this region, but \nequally important, to building and encouraging one of the finest, most \nprofessional teams of Federal employees in the Nation.\n  The legacy of Terry Carlstrom's 41-year career can be seen in our \nnational parks across the country and especially here in the National \nCapital region but it can also be seen in the people who have been \nfortunate enough to come to know him. He has earned the admiration and \nrespect of his colleagues in the National Park Service as well as the \nvisitors to the parks he has worked to improve. It is my firm \nconviction that public service is one of the most honorable callings, \none that demands unwavering dedication to the citizens and country they \nserve. Throughout his career, Terry has exemplified this commitment to \nhis country and to his fellow citizens. I want to extend my personal \ncongratulations to Terry on his very distinguished career and join with \nhis friends and coworkers in wishing him well in the years \nahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/18/senate-section/article/S11491-2", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11491]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          TRIBUTE TO A DISTINGUISHED IOWA EDUCATOR, ANGIE KING\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, one of the great joys of my job as \nSenator is working closely with talented, dedicated Iowans from all \nwalks of life. I take a moment to salute one of those exceptional \npeople, one of Iowa's most distinguished public educators, Angie King.\n  Angie King has dedicated her life to children and public education, \nfirst as a classroom teacher, later as two-term president of the \n32,000-member Iowa State Education Association, and, until her \nretirement this week, as a senior staff member of that Association.\n  The fact is that, as an educator-leader, Angie King speaks with a \nspecial authority that can only come from decades of experience on the \nfront line as a classroom teacher. For 21 years, she taught elementary \nstudents in the Des Moines public schools. Of all the titles Angie King \nhas held in the course of her career, she prizes none more highly than \nthe simple title of ``teacher.''\n  Angie King, as a teacher, leader and advocate is one reason why Iowa \npublic schools are among the most respected and highest achieving in \nthe United States. The marketplace claims that you get what you pay \nfor. But in Iowa, when it comes to teachers, we get far, far better \nthan we pay for. Despite modest salaries, my state is blessed with an \nextraordinary cadre of talented teachers. And most folks in Iowa know \nthis and appreciate it. We hold our teachers in special esteem. And \nwe're grateful for the long hours--and the generous hearts that they \nbring to their jobs.\n  For many people, there is a defining moment in their careers. For \nAngie King, that moment came one day in 1972 when she missed a staff \nmeeting at her elementary school. The next day, she discovered she has \nbeen elected in absentia to serve as a local representative of the Des \nMoines Education Association. Some people are born leaders; some people \npursue leadership; and some people have leadership thrust upon them. \nThat's what happened to Angie King. But she embraced her new role and \nresponsibilities with energy and excellence.\n  As an association representative, she became more interested in the \nworld of education beyond the four walls of her own classroom. She \nbecame a tireless activist, going on to serve as vice president of the \nDes Moines Education Association, a charter member of the ISEA Women's \nCaucus, an elected member of ISEA's executive committee, and, in 1985, \nchair of the ISEA Political Action Committee.\n  In 1990, Angie King was elected to serve the first of two terms as \npresident of the Iowa State Education Association. She was one of a \nhandful of women in history to be elected ISEA president, and the first \nelementary school teacher to hold that office.\n  In her farewell address at the conclusion of her second term in 1994, \nAngie King shared one of her favorite quotes from Albert Camus: ``In \nthe midst of winter I find there is in me an invincible summer.'' \n``That simple statement,'' she told the ISEA Delegate Assembly, \n``captures the very essence of who we are and what we do. In every \nchild there is an invincible summer. It is our responsibility to \nnurture it and to foster it. And in each one of us there is, too, an \ninvincible summer. It's what keeps us going back day after day, year \nafter year, in the midst of sometimes very cold and dreary \nconditions.''\n  Since 1994, Angie King has served as the political action specialist \nfor the Iowa State Education Association. With her retirement this \nweek, she concludes a distinguished career in public education spanning \nthree and a half decades.\n  Angie King has made a real difference as a dedicated teacher, leader, \nand champion of public education. I know that she is looking forward to \nspending time nurturing the garden she has neglected while nurturing \nthe children of Iowa. I am deeply grateful for her service, and I wish \nher all the best in the years ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/18/senate-section/article/S11491-3", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11491-S11492]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT INSTITUTE\n\n Mr. TALENT.

PMI's professional \ncertification of Project Management Professional, or PMP, is highly \nrespected across numerous industries. Professionals who have earned \nthis credential are recognized daily for their value-added \ncontributions to the organizations they serve.\n  The St. Louis chapter was founded on October 14, 1994, as the 71st \nchapter of PMI. At that time, the chapter had 24 charter members. \nToday, the St. Louis chapter is recognized as one of the fastest \ngrowing national chapters with over 600 members, more than 100 of whom \nhave become certified PMPs. The chapter's board members and volunteers \nhost monthly dinner and educational meetings, and they provide ongoing \nsupport for special events including national speaker presentations and \nPMP certification workshops.\n  The members of the St. Louis chapter are working professionals from \nregional businesses that include Fortune 500 companies, Federal, State \nand local government agencies, as well as mid-to-small size companies, \nstart-ups and not-for-profits. Their efforts are important to the \noverall success of the region.

LOUIS HURLING CLUB NATIONAL CHAMPIONS\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I wish to pay special tribute to the \nSt. Louis Hurling Club on their National Championship of the North \nAmerican Gaelic Athletic Association, Junior-C Division on September 3, \n2004.\n  The St. Louis Hurling Club was founded in the Summer of 2002 by Paul \nC. Rohde, Daniel D. Lapke, and Patrick O'Connor. Their vision included \nintroducing the sport of hurling to the greater metropolitan area of \nSt. Louis, MO., creating opportunities to play the sport, and \ndeveloping strong St. Louis representation in nationwide competition.\n  In just 2 short years the St. Louis Hurling Club has expanded to a \nfour-team league, and has become the second-largest club of primarily \nAmerican-born hurlers in North America. In just the first year of \nexistence, the Gaelic Athletic Association extended the rare invitation \nto the St. Louis Hurling Club to join twenty-one other cities to the \nNorth American County Board. In September 2004, the St. Louis Hurling \nClub traveled to Colorado and returned with the National Championship \nby defeating clubs from Milwaukee and Seattle.\n  Paul Rohde, Daniel Lapke, and Patrick O'Connor are to be commended \nfor their vision, leadership, and introduction of the ancient Irish \nsport as well as the continued growth of Irish culture to St. Louis. \nMO. Again, I wish to congratulate the St. Louis Hurling Club on their \nNational Championship and wish them future success as they continue to \nevolve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/18/senate-section/article/S11492-2", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11492-S11493]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:03 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House passed \nthe bill (S. 1301) to amend title 18, United States Code, to prohibit \nvideo voyeurism in the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of \nthe United States, and for other purposes, with an amendment.\n  The message also announced that the House agreed to the amendment of \nthe Senate to the bill (H.R. 1113) to authorize an exchange of land at \nFort Frederica National Monument, and for other purposes.\n  The message further announced that the House agreed to the amendment \nof the Senate to the bill (H.R. 1284) to amend the Reclamation Projects \nAuthorization and Adjustment Act of 1992 to increase the Federal share \nof the costs of the San Gabriel Basin demonstration project.\n  The message also announced that the House agreed to the amendment of \nthe Senate to the bill (H.R. 1417) to amend title 17, United States \nCode, to replace copyright arbitration royalty panels with Copyright \nRoyalty Judges, and for other purposes.\n  The message further announced that the House agreed to the amendment \nof the Senate to the bill (H.R. 1446) to support the efforts of the \nCalifornia Missions Foundation to restore and repair the Spanish \ncolonial and mission-era missions in the State of California and to \npreserve the artworks and artifacts of these missions, and for other \npurposes.\n  The message further announced that the House agreed to the amendment \nof the Senate to the bill (H.R. 1964) to assist the States of \nConnecticut, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania in conserving \npriority lands and natural resources in the Highlands region, and for \nother purposes.\n  The message further announced that the House agreed to the amendment \nof the Senate to the bill (H.R. 3936) to amend title 38, United States \nCode, to authorize the principal office of the United States Court of \nAppeals for Veterans Claims to be at any location in the Washington, \nD.C., metropolitan area, rather than only in the District of Columbia, \nand expressing the sense of Congress that a dedicated Veterans \nCourthouse and Justice Center should be provided for that Court and \nthose it serves and should be located, if feasible, at a site owned by \nthe United States that is part of or proximate to the Pentagon \nReservation, and for other purposes.\n  The message also announced that the House agreed to the amendment of \nthe Senate to the bill (H.R. 4516) to require the Secretary of Energy \nto carry out a program of research and development to advance high-end \ncomputing.\n\n  The message further announced that the House agreed to the amendment \nof the Senate to the bill (H.R. 4593) to establish wilderness areas, \npromote conservation, improve public land, and provide for the high \nquality development in Lincoln County, Nevada, and for other purposes.\n  The message also announced that the House passed the following bills, \nwithout amendment:\n\n       S. 434.

A bill to amend section 1928 of the Social Security Act to \nencourage the production of influenza vaccines by eliminating the price \ncap applicable to the purchase of such vaccines under contracts entered \ninto by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, to amend the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 to establish a tax credit to encourage \nvaccine production capacity, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, there was a lot of hysteria a short time \nago about the flu vaccine and the fact it was not available to a lot of \npeople. There are several problems. One, the flu vaccine production \ncurrently takes approximately 6 months. I am introducing a bill that \nwill expedite that and will have the sense of the Senate to steer the \nNIH research dollars toward the development of faster technology. They \nare using egg cultures to grow this vaccine when it can be done through \nthe cells of silk moths. It will take more research to get there and we \nwill encourage them to do that.\n  Second, the bill removes price controls for the purchasing of the flu \nvaccine. This happened during the Clinton administration. We should \nhave learned during the Nixon administration that price controls in \nreality do not work. The result of this has been that we do not have \nmany companies now that are willing to get in there and take the risk \nand develop and manufacture these vaccines. As soon as they do, they \nfind out there is no profit at the other end because of price controls.\n  Lastly, we allow investment tax credits.\n  I have long been dedicated to quality healthcare for my constituents \nin Oklahoma and across America. I supported the Medicare bill of 2003 \nto give a voluntary prescription drug benefit to seniors. I have \nchampioned the rural health care providers, who received some of the \ngreatest benefits of the Medicare bill. In 1997, I was one of few \nRepublicans to vote against the Balanced Budget Act because of its lack \nof support for rural hospitals. Back then, I made a commitment to not \nallow our rural hospitals to be closed, and I am pleased we finally \naddressed that important issue in the Medicare legislation. I also \ncosponsored S. 816, the Health Care Access and Rural Equity Act, to \nprotect and preserve access of Medicare beneficiaries to health care in \nrural regions.\n  I am a strong advocate of medical liability reform and am an original \ncosponsor of S. 11, the Patients First Act, to protect patients' access \nto quality and affordable health care by reducing the effects of \nexcessive liability costs. There are solutions to alleviate the burden \nplaced on physicians and patients by excessive medical malpractice \nlawsuits, and I am committed to this vital reform.\n  I have also worked with officials from the Center for Medicare and \nMedicaid Services to expand access to life-saving Implantable Cardiac \nDefibrillators. I supported legislation to increase the supply of \npancreative islet cells for research and cosponsored a bill to take the \nabortion pill RU-486 off the market in the United States.\n  The federal government invests in improving hospitals and healthcare \ninitiatives, and I have fought hard to ensure that Oklahoma gets its \nfair share. Specifically, over the past three years, I have helped to \nsecure $5.2 million in funding for the Oklahoma Medical Research \nFoundation, the Oklahoma State Department of Health planning initiative \nfor a rural telemedicine system, the INTEGRIS Healthcare System, the \nUniversity of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, the Oklahoma Center for \nthe Advancement of Science and Technology, St. Anthony's Heart \nHospital, the Hillcrest Healthcare System, and the Morton Health \nCenter.\n  The unexpected influenza, flu, vaccine shortage beginning last month \nhighlights the need to encourage the production of flu vaccine in \nAmerica. As you know, on October 5th, Chiron, a California-based \nbiotechnology company, notified U.S. health officials that its plant in \nLiverpool, England had been shut down due to vaccine contamination. \nAlmost 50,000 doses of flu vaccine were thrown away, which created a \nsevere shortage for Americans just as the flu season began.\n  In light of the current shortage, I have examined why America found \nitself unable to accommodate the public demand for the flu vaccine. As \nwe have seen, once a vaccine shortage strikes, a rapid response is \ndifficult and often impossible. Thirty years ago, more than a dozen \nAmerican companies were in the flu vaccine business. Today only two \ncompanies make the vaccine for America, and only one in an America-\nbased company. This is no coincidence. High liability costs, tedious \nproduction, price caps, and the complicated United States tax code have \nkept the market bare.\n  In October, President Bush signed the JOBS bill, which curbed the \nbillion-dollar lawsuits that have crippled the flu vaccine industry. By \nadding flu vaccine to the list of vaccines protected by the National \nVaccine Injury Compensation Program, VICP, a no-fault alternative must \nbe used for resolving vaccine injury claims. I am encouraged with this \nprogress, but more can be done to prevent a shortage in the future.\n  My bill supports allocating a greater percentage of the National \nInstitutes of Health budget to develop faster and safer vaccine \nproduction technology. The ever-changing nature of the flu virus \nresults in a complicated production process. The dominant strain of the \nflu virus mutates each year, requiring a different vaccine for every \nflu\n\n[[Page S11498]]\n\nseason. Because harvesting the flu vaccine currently takes at least six \nmonths and requires tens of thousands of fertilized eggs susceptible to \ncontamination, this process must begin nearly a year before the flu \nseason begins.\n  Research should be focused on developing new technologies to allow us \nto produce more vaccine--in the same season--when we encounter a \nshortage. A company in Connecticut is developing a flu vaccine relying \non cell lines from silk moths. This type of innovative research \npromises to shave at least one month off of production time and \nsignificantly reduce cost.\n  My bill includes a sense of the Senate on the importance of \nallocating a greater percentage of the National Institutes of Health, \nNIH, research dollars to developing new technology in flu vaccine \nproduction. The encouragement of safer and faster flu vaccine \nproduction technology is a prudent use of existing Federal research \ndollars through the National Institutes of Health.\n\n  Furthermore, my bill removes the suffocating price controls that have \ndiscouraged companies from producing the flu vaccine. The Vaccines For \nChildren program, VFC, enacted under the Clinton administration, \nimposed a price cap on all vaccines purchased through Federal \ncontracts. From a shortsighted perspective, these regulated prices may \nexpand access to vaccines. However, in the long run this policy \ndevastates the vaccine production industry and decreases the \navailability of vaccines. This occurred in 1998 when manufacturers of \ntetanus diphtheria vaccine refused to bid on Government contracts. \nConsequently, this vaccine is no longer available to children through \nthe VFC program.\n  Similarly, the CDC purchased nearly 12 percent of the flu vaccine \nthis season, and significant quantities were purchased through the \nDepartment of Defense, the Veteran's Administration and Medicare. The \nprice controls imposed from Federal government purchasing create a \nhigh-risk, low-reward business market. Price controls destroy any \nprofit incentive. Manufacturers avoid this artificial environment and \nwill continue to as long as the government over steps its bounds.\n  The harmful effect of government price controls is especially \npronounced in the flu vaccine market because the vaccine has a single-\nseason shelf life. The difficulty of predicting the demand for vaccines \neach year exposes companies great risk. A slight drop in demand can \nforce them out of the market. Financial losses--from 7 million extra \ndoses in 2002 and 4.5 million extra in 2003--compelled Wyeth \nPharmaceutical Company to end its flu vaccine manufacturing.\n  In addition to lifting price controls, the government can loosen its \ngrip on the flu vaccine market by reforming its complicated tax code. \nFortunately, the JOBS bill made headway in simplifying the current \nUnited States international tax rules. To further offset the heavy \npenalties within the United States tax code, my bill gives a tax credit \nto companies, new and old, that construct facilities to manufacture flu \nvaccine.\n  Currently, ten American companies produce the 47 FDA-approved \nvaccines. An investment tax credit will encourage these existing \ncompanies to expand their production to cover the flu vaccine and will \ninvite start-up companies to join the industry. This will better equip \nthe United States market to prevent and deal with a shortage in the \nfuture.\n\n  Scientific experts consider vaccination to be the most effective \nmedical intervention, and we live in an age of unprecedented vaccine \ndevelopment and implementation. We cannot continue to overregulate the \nflu vaccine industry and hope companies will hang on and produce \nvaccines regardless of profit. The current national flu vaccine \nshortage reveals the need to act.\n  My bill would steer NIH research dollars towards cutting-edge \ntechnology, remove suffocating price controls, and free American \ncompanies to enter the flu vaccine industry with an investment tax \ncredit. I urge my colleagues to stand with me in supporting this vital \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INHOFE:\n  S. 2998. A bill to promote the development of the emerging commercial \nhuman space flight industry, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/18/senate-section/article/S11498-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11498-S11500]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      COMMERCIAL SPACE LAUNCH ACT\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I want to introduce two bills today. One \nof them is about a program nobody seems to know about. That is the \nspace launch program. I don't know whether it is in the State of Texas \nor where they are doing this. But in Oklahoma, in Burns Flat, we have \nbeen very active in trying to get the Commercial Space Launch Program \ngoing. This is an opportunity for people to go into suborbital launch \nvehicles using a hybrid technology of a combination rocket injection \nengine. We are doing this. There have been several of them so far.\n  I have been a commercial pilot now for almost 50 years--47 years, I \nguess. I have a natural interest in this. I have had occasion to fly an \nairplane around the world. I have watched it from all levels.\n  I see the excitement in people's faces saying, I can fly in space.\n  We have this program which nobody knows about. It is a program that \nwill allow people to get into things such as a Learjet that has a \nrocket on that will actually launch them, take them up and give them \nthe experience of travel in space.\n  There have been some problems with this, however. There are some \nproblems with people being able to do this with the company putting \nthese programs together incurring responsibilities and liabilities.\n  It is very similar to the program we have been concerned with in the \noil industry to try to expand it and keep people from being able to \nhave frivolous lawsuits. That is what we are up against here.\n  We have introduced a bill that is designed to allow participation in \nthis emerging space launching activity for a greater number of people.\n  The FAA will now have sole regulation authority for the suborbital \nhybrid vehicles. It will be appropriately considered. We are not taking \nany risk here. This is just to allow the private sector to enjoy this \ntype of thing.\n  I will be introducing today S. 2998 with the idea of making this a \nreality and giving this privilege to a lot of people and allowing us to \ndevelop technology.\n  It is interesting. A lot of people go to an event every year in \nOshkosh, WI. I have gone for 27 consecutive years. We go up there to \nsee all of the new technology, what people are putting together in \ntheir experimental aircraft, airplanes they are making in their garages \nand basements. A lot of technology we are now using in the space \nprogram was actually started right there in someone's garage. That is \nessentially what we want to get at with the Commercial Space Launch Act \nwe introduce today.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. TALENT:\n  S. 3001. A bill entitled the ``Hybrid HOV Access Act''; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n   Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I am pleased to be introducing this bill, \nwhich will allow more owners of hybrid electric vehicles, or HEVs, to \nhave access to HOV lanes on Federal highways. For all of us who have a \ndesire to lessen our dependence on foreign oil and encourage the use of \nrenewable energy, this bill represents a step forward towards achieving \nthose goals.\n  The language that is currently in the highway bills passed by the \nHouse and the Senate allows hybrid vehicles that achieve a 45 mile-per-\ngallon fuel economy highway rating to use HOV lanes. Any hybrid that \nachieves that kind of fuel economy certainly deserves to get that \nstatus, because it is a very impressive fuel economy rating and \nrepresents a substantial improvement over non-hybrid vehicles. What the \n45 mile-per-gallon standard fails to take into account, however, is \nthat many larger hybrid vehicles achieve a much larger fuel economy \nimprovement over their internal combustion engine counterparts, and \nthus save more energy, than smaller vehicles which manage to meet the \nstandard but are a less drastic improvement over their non-hybrid \ncounterparts.\n  To illustrate this, take the 2005 model Honda Civic HEV, which gets \njust over 45 miles-per-gallon. This represents less than a 40 percent \nimprovement over the comparable internal\n\n[[Page S11499]]\n\ncombustion model. The 2005 Ford Escape HEV, on the other hand, is a \ntruck, so it gets fewer miles per gallon than a Civic, between 35 and \n40. However, this is a 75 percent improvement over its internal \ncombustion engine counterpart, and in addition, the Escape HEV emits 3-\n4 tons fewer greenhouse gases every year than the non-hybrid.\n  There is no reason to discriminate against these larger, American-\nmade hybrids like the Ford Escape. They are truly engineering marvels \nand are so clearly beneficial for the environment. The bill that I have \nsponsored will give states the discretion to open up their HOV lanes to \nhybrid vehicles that achieve a substantial increase in fuel economy \nrelative to comparable gasoline vehicles, or achieve a substantial \nincrease in lifetime fuel savings relative to comparable gasoline \nvehicles. It creates a minimum standard of improvement necessary for \nhybrids, but gives states the option of increasing the requirements. \nThis bill also allows states to open HOV lanes to single occupancy \nadvanced lean burn vehicles that achieve at least a 25 percent increase \nin fuel economy relative to comparable gasoline vehicles and that are \ncertified to Clean Air Act Tier 2 standards.\n  I am hopeful that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle can agree \nthat we should do all we can to encourage the use of renewable energy \nin our country, and hybrid vehicles are an important part of that. The \npeople who drive these vehicles are doing their part to help clean up \nthe air and increase energy conservation, and we should give more \npeople an incentive to buy these vehicles by giving them access to HOV \nlanes. Thank you, Mr. President.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for himself and Mr. Ensign):\n  S. 3003. A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to convey to \nthe City of Henderson, Nevada, certain Federal land located in the \nCity, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today for myself and Senator Ensign \nto introduce the Southern Nevada Limited Transition Area Act, which \nenhances the ability of a rapidly growing community to diversify its \neconomy, gainfully employ its residents, and achieve fiscal \nsustainability.\n  The bill I am introducing today would convey 547 acres of land from \nthe Bureau of Land Management to the city of Henderson, NV, for \ndevelopment as an employment and business center.\n  BLM has designated this parcel for disposal because of its urban \nsurroundings and its isolation from other public land, which renders it \ndifficult for the agency to manage.\n  The parcel is located in a rapidly growing area of the city, but is \nimpacted by aircraft noise and overflights from the nearby Henderson \nExecutive Airport that make it unsuitable for residential use.\n  But rather than cringing from these impediments, the city of \nHenderson sees opportunity. The city's land-use planning department \nenvisions a business center that provides diverse employment \nopportunities for the region, while helping to pay for public \ninfrastructure in nearby residential areas.\n  This bill establishes the conditions to make that vision come true.\n  The bill would convey the land to the city by patent. The city would \nthen subdivide and sell lots at fair market value. As in previous \nconveyances of Federal land designated in the Southern Nevada Public \nLands Management Act for disposal, 85 percent of the proceeds from \nsales would return to the BLM's Special Account for acquiring \nenvironmentally sensitive land. Five percent of the proceeds would fund \nthe State of Nevada's general education program. And the city of \nHenderson could use the remaining 10 percent to cover expenses \nassociated with subdividing the property and providing infrastructure.\n  Henderson, NV, is a new and rapidly growing city. Its leaders are \ndedicated to making the city a national model of logical development, \ndiversified employment, and fiscal sustainability. This bill \nestablishes the conditions needed to realize that vision.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3003\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Southern Nevada Limited \n     Transition Area Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

SOUTHERN NEVADA LIMITED TRANSITION AREA.\n\n       (a) Conveyance.--Notwithstanding the Federal Land Policy \n     and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.), on \n     request of the City, the Secretary shall, without \n     consideration and subject to all valid existing rights, \n     convey to the City all right, title, and interest of the \n     United States in and to the Transition Area.\n       (b) Use of Land for Nonresidential Development.--\n       (1) In general.--After the conveyance to the City under \n     subsection (a), the City may sell any portion or portions of \n     the Transition Area for purposes of nonresidential \n     development.\n       (2) Method of sale.--The sale of land under paragraph (1) \n     shall be--\n       (A) through a competitive bidding process; and\n       (B) for not less than fair market value.\n       (3) Compliance with charter.--Except as provided in \n     paragraphs (2) and (4), the City may sell parcels within the \n     Transition Area only in accordance with the procedures for \n     conveyances established in the City Charter.\n       (4) Disposition of proceeds.--Of the gross proceeds from \n     the sale of land under paragraph (1), the City shall--\n       (A) deposit 85 percent in the Special Account;\n       (B) retain 10 percent as compensation for the costs \n     incurred by the City--\n       (i) in carrying out land sales under paragraph (1); and\n       (ii) for the provision of public infrastructure to serve \n     the Transition Area, including planning, engineering, \n     surveying, and subdividing the Transition Area for \n     nonresidential development; and\n       (C) pay 5 percent to the State for use in the general \n     education program of the State.\n       (c) Use of Land for Recreation or Other Public Purposes.--\n     The City may elect to retain parcels in the Transition Area \n     for public recreation or other public purposes consistent \n     with the Act of June 14, 1926 (commonly known as the \n     ``Recreation and Public Purposes Act'') (43 U.S.C. 869 et \n     seq.) by providing to the Secretary written notice of the \n     election.\n       (d) Noise Compatibility Requirements.--The City shall--\n       (1) plan and manage the Transition Area in accordance with \n     section 47504 of title 49, United States Code (relating to \n     airport noise compatibility planning), and regulations \n     promulgated in accordance with that section; and\n       (2) agree that if any land in the Transition Area is sold, \n     leased, or otherwise conveyed by the City, the sale, lease, \n     or conveyance shall contain a limitation to require uses \n     compatible with that airport noise compatibility planning.\n       (e) Reversion.--\n       (1) In general.--If any parcel of land in the Transition \n     Area is not conveyed for nonresidential development under \n     this Act or reserved for recreation or other public purposes \n     under subsection (c) within 20 years after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the parcel of land shall, if \n     determined to be appropriate by the Secretary, revert to the \n     United States.\n       (2) Inconsistent use.--If the City uses any parcel of land \n     within the Transition Area in a manner that is inconsistent \n     with the uses specified in this section--\n       (A) at the election of the Secretary, the parcel shall \n     revert to the United States; or\n       (B) if the Secretary does not make an election under \n     paragraph (1), the City shall sell the parcel of land in \n     accordance with subsection (b)(2).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER:\n  S. 3004. A bill to amend chapter 99 of the Internal Revenue Code of \n1986 to clarify that certain coal industry health benefits may not be \nmodified or terminated; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nmake very clear that Congress fully protected the health insurance \nbenefits\n\n[[Page S11500]]\n\nof miners and their families when we passed the Coal Act in 1992. \nUnfortunately, we have recently seen bankruptcy courts disregard the \nCoal Act and absolve companies of their obligations to provide health \nbenefits for workers and retirees. This is unacceptable. And the bill I \nam introducing today reiterates that the bankruptcy code does not \nsupercede the Coal Act.\n  This year another company has abandon promises it made to workers and \nretirees in West Virginia. Horizon Natural Resources sought and \nreceived a court ruling that releases it from its contracts with union \nminers and allows it to avoid honoring health care benefit obligations \nfor over 2,300 retired miners. This is a morally bankrupt corporate \nstrategy, and is inconsistent with the Coal Act passed by Congress in \n1992.\n  The Coal Act was needed in 1992 to prevent some companies from \nwalking away from their clear contractual obligations and agreements \nwith their workers. One of the provisions of that bill was written \nespecially with the intent of not allowing companies to simply \nreorganize as a way to get out of their obligations to their workers. \nUnfortunately, too many companies are increasingly using bankruptcy \ncourts to achieve the same results.\n  It should not be necessary for me to introduce this bill today. \nCongress has already spoken on this subject. The law is clear: Coal Act \nretirees are entitled to full benefits provided under the statute. No \njudge should rewrite the law to take those benefits away. However, \nbecause judges are legislating from the bench, it will be helpful for \nCongress to reiterate our intention to protect the health benefits of \ncoal miners and their families.\n  I recognize that the 108th Congress is coming to a close. But I am \nintroducing this legislation today because this issue is extremely \nimportant to all of those who are being victimized by the bankruptcy \ncourts. I hope that early next year my colleagues will join me in this \neffort to protect the miners, retired miners, and families who are \nsimply seeking the benefits they were promised in exchange for years of \nhard work.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. STABENOW (for herself, Mr. Craig, Mr. Levin, Mr. Crapo, \n        Mr. Jeffords, and Mr. Rockefeller):\n  S. 3005. A bill to allow State Homeland Security Program grant funds \nto be used to pay costs associated with the attendance of part-time and \nvolunteer first responders at terrorism response courses approved by \nthe Office for State and Local Government Coordination and \nPreparedness; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Stabenow-Craig \nRural and Part-time Firefighter Training Fairness Act. This bill would \nensure that our part-time and rural firefighters are not being treated \nas second class citizens. I want to thank Senator Craig for his hard \nwork on this very important issue, and Senators Levin, Crapo, \nRockefeller, and Jeffords for their support of this bill.\n  Mr. President, many part-time and volunteer firefighters in rural and \nsmall communities across the country are not attending Office of \nDomestic Preparedness-approved terrorism response training courses \nbecause Federal guidelines do not allow them to be reimbursed for the \ntime they are away from their full-time jobs. Our bill would simply \ndirect the ODP to allow part-time and volunteer first responders, to \nreceive a reasonable stipend when they participate in ODP-approved \nterrorism response courses.\n  The Federal Government should not penalize rural and small \ncommunities and their firefighters from receiving training necessary to \nrespond to a terrorist attack. In several counties in northern lower \nMichigan, State Homeland Security Grant funds sit unused because their \nfire departments are composed entirely of volunteer or part-time \nfirefighters. Last year, the State of Michigan set aside $9 million in \nHomeland Security grants to prepare firefighters, including ODP \ntraining courses, to respond to terrorist incidents. However, this \ngrant money is being underutilized since 72 percent of the firefighters \nin Michigan are volunteer or part-time and are not attending terrorism \nresponse training sessions.\n  All firefighters need the capability to respond to all types of \nemergencies. When Americans call 9-1-1, the fire department doesn't \nsend only their full-time firefighters, they send everyone regardless \nof their status. Most part-time firefighters in rural areas hold full-\ntime jobs in addition to serving and protecting their communities. It \nis unreasonable to expect them to take leave from their regular jobs, \nand forgo their pay from their full-time jobs, to attend terrorism \nresponse training courses that include incident command, civil action \nmanagement, and radiological response.\n  Mr. President, many of our small, rural communities face the same \nhomeland security challenges as larger cities with more resources. For \nexample, Michigan has a long international border with Canada, and many \nof these small and rural border communities rely on part-time and \nvolunteer firefighters. These responders must be capable of protecting \nthese borders against the same terrorist threats that urban areas face. \nWhen there is an accident in the future and, God forbid, if there is a \nterrorist attack, we're not going to send only full-time firefighters \nto save people's lives.\n  This bill was included as a bipartisan amendment to the Senate \nversion of the fiscal year 2005 Department of Homeland Security \nAppropriations bill, but was removed by the House Republican leadership \nin conference. This issue is too important for Congress to ignore, and \nI am going to keep fighting until our volunteer and part-time \nfirefighters are treated fairly and receive the terrorism response \ntraining they need.\n  Mr. President, I'm pleased to note that the change in Federal \nguidelines this bill requires will not cost the Government any funding. \nIt will not affect the distribution of State Homeland Security grants. \nIt will just enable communities that have been awarded these grants to \nuse them to pay their firefighters a reasonable stipend when they leave \ntheir full-time jobs and attend these terrorism response course. This \nis a matter of fairness to ensure that those that we rely on to respond \nto emergencies have the training they need.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3005\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 470\n\n       Whereas Leroy Gordon Cooper, Jr., was born on March 6, \n     1927, in Shawnee, Oklahoma;\n       Whereas Gordon Cooper served as a colonel in the United \n     States Air Force and was selected as one of the original \n     Project Mercury astronauts in April of 1959;\n       Whereas the 7 original Project Mercury astronauts helped to \n     inspire generations of scientists and engineers;\n       Whereas, when Gordon Cooper piloted the Faith 7 spacecraft \n     on the final operational mission of Project Mercury from May \n     15 to May 16, 1963, he traveled a total of 546,167 statute \n     miles and became the first astronaut from the United States \n     to spend more than a day in space;\n       Whereas, when Gordon Cooper served as command pilot on the \n     8-day 120-orbit Gemini 5 mission that began on August 21, \n     1965, he and pilot Charles Conrad established a new\n\n[[Page S11501]]\n\n     space endurance record by traveling a distance of 3,312,993 \n     miles in an elapsed time of 190 hours and 56 minutes;\n       Whereas Gordon Cooper was the first man to go into space \n     for a second time;\n       Whereas Gordon Cooper served as backup command pilot for \n     the Gemini 12 mission and as backup commander for the Apollo \n     10 flight;\n       Whereas Gordon Cooper logged 222 hours in space and retired \n     from the Air Force and the National Aeronautics and Space \n     Administration in 1970;\n       Whereas the special honors Gordon Cooper received during \n     his lifetime included the Air Force Distinguished Flying \n     Cross, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration \n     Distinguished Service Medal, and the John F. Kennedy Trophy; \n     and\n       Whereas Gordon Cooper passed away at his home in Ventura, \n     California, on October 4, 2004, at the age of 77: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate honors the life of astronaut \n     Leroy Gordon Cooper, Jr.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, many people may not be aware of Oklahoma's \nsignificant history in aviation, or that I am the only commercially \nlicensed pilot in the Senate and have a passion for flying.\n  Since 1910, beginning with Charles F. Willard who only flew a few \nhundred yards in a south Oklahoma City field, Oklahomans have been \nflying.\n  The following year, Clyde Cessna, an automobile dealer from Enid who \nlater formed the Cessna Aircraft Company, flew his mono-wing airplane \nnear Jet, OK.\n  Such early flights in Oklahoma continued and in 1929 perhaps one of \nthe most notable aviation events occurred in Waynoka, Oklahoma, where \nCharles Lindbergh stopped on the first transcontinental passenger air \nand rail service.\n  By 1931, Wiley Post, from Maysville, OK, gained international \nrecognition when he flew around the world in a little over eight days. \nIn July 1991, I had the honor of recreating Post's trip on its 60th \nAnniversary.\n  However, Oklahoma's aviation history does not stop there. On November \n2, 1929, 26 licensed women pilots founded what was known as the Ninety-\nNine Club, or the Ninety-Nines. It was called so at the suggestion of \nits first president, Amelia Earheart, because of the 117 licensed women \npilots in America who were contacted about joining the club, only 99 \nactually joined. The South Central Section of the Ninety-Nine Club \ncomprising several states including Oklahoma, has through the years, \nissued several publications and in 1962, Mary Lester of the Oklahoma \nChapter created a new version of the Club's publication, the Ninety-\nNine News. Currently, the Ninety-Nine Club is an international \norganization of licensed women pilots from 35 countries, with its \ninternational headquarters at Will Rogers World Airport in Oklahoma \nCity.\n  Today I rise to introduce a resolution to honor the life and work of \nanother Oklahoman in this long line of aviation who served our country \nby fearlessly dedicating his life to space travel and exploration.\n  Leroy Gordon Cooper, Jr., frequently called ``Gordo'', who passed \naway at his home on October 4, was often known as the first astronaut \nfrom the United States to spend more than a day in space. He was born \nin Shawnee, OK on March 6, 1927 and joined the Marines during World War \nII. He then transferred to the Air Force in 1949 and graduated from the \nAir Force Institute of Technology with a degree in aeronautical \nengineering in 1956.\n  After graduating, Cooper became attracted to the space program as an \nelite test pilot for the Air Force at Edwards Air Force Base in \nCalifornia. During his career, he logged more than 7,000 hours of \nflying, including 4,000 hours flying jets. He also flew commercial and \ngeneral aviation planes and helicopters.\n  Cooper seemed to be born in the right place at the right time--with \nthe right abilities. In 1958, the National Aeronautical and Space \nAdministration, NASA, announced its new endeavor, Project Mercury, with \nthree goals in mind: to place a spacecraft carrying a person into \norbital flight around the Earth, to investigate a person's performance \ncapabilities and his/her ability to function in space, and to recover \nthe person and spacecraft safely. NASA began searching for people, \nespecially military test pilots, who were willing and capable of \nenduring such a dangerous mission. They focused on finding military \ntest pilots because they seemed to experience similar conditions to \nthose of space.\n  On April 1, 1959, it was announced that Cooper was chosen, along with \nAlan Shepard, Gus Grissom, John Glenn, Scott Carpenter, Walter Schirra, \nJr., and Deke Slayton not only as one of the seven Project Mercury \nastronauts, but as one of America's first astronauts. These seven men \nmade history with this project as they laid the groundwork for future \nspace flights.\n  On May 15 and 16, 1963, Cooper piloted Faith 7, the flight that ended \nthe operational phase of Project Mercury. During this mission, he \norbited the Earth 22 times and logged more time in space than all \nprevious five Mercury astronauts combined. He also became known as the \nfirst American astronaut to sleep in orbit, as well as on the launch \npad.\n  Shortly thereafter, Cooper received the NASA Distinguished Service \nMedal from President John F. Kennedy at a White House ceremony.\n  In August 1965, Cooper commanded the 8 day Gemini 5 mission with \nCharles Conrad. On this mission, Cooper set a new space endurance \nrecord, covering 120 revolutions and 3,312,993 miles in 190 hours, 56 \nminutes and 3 seconds and became the first man to make a second orbital \nflight.\n  Overall, during his two space flights, Cooper logged 225 hours, 15 \nminutes and 3 seconds. He also served as backup command pilot for \nGemini 12 and backup commander for Apollo X. He was the last American \nastronaut to orbit the Earth for an entire orbit by himself.\n  After receiving an honorary Doctorate of Science degree from Oklahoma \nCity University in 1967, Cooper retired from the Air Force and NASA as \na colonel in 1970. However, his involvement with space did not end \nafter his retirement. He served as a consultant to several companies \nrelated to aerospace, electronics, and energy fields, and was vice \npresident for research and development for Walt Disney Enterprises, \nInc. Cooper also devoted part of his life to studying UFOs, and wrote \nLeap of Faith based on his experiences as a pilot and astronaut.\n  Even though we have lost this great American hero, his legacy and \npassion for exploring space live on through continued space ventures \nsuch as the Ansari X Prize. The famed $10 million X Prize was recently \nawarded to the team of SpaceShipOne, whose pilot, Brian Binnie, broke \nan August 22, 1963 altitude record by going 69.6 miles above Earth's \nsurface, ironically, on October 4, the same day of Cooper's passing.\n  I am pleased that my good friend and colleague Congressman Cass \nBallenger has led the way in honoring the life and service of this \ngreat space pioneer. I know that Mr. Ballenger shares my passion of \naviation and space exploration and hope that we will continue to build \non the progress and sacrifice made by men like Gordon Cooper.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 471--AUTHORIZING THE PRINTING OF TRIBUTES AND OTHER \n       RELATED MATERIALS IN HONOR OF THE LATE SENATOR PAUL SIMON\n\n  Mr. DURBIN submitted the following resolution; which was considered \nand agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 471\n\n       Resolved, That there be printed as a Senate document a \n     compilation of tributes and other related materials \n     concerning the Honorable Paul Simon, late a Senator from the \n     State of Illinois.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 472--TO HONOR THE PEOPLE OF GEORGIA ON THE FIRST \n                   ANNIVERSARY OF THE ROSE REVOLUTION\n\n  Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Biden, and Mr. \nHagel) submitted the following resolution; which was considered and \nagreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 472\n\n       Whereas, on November 23, 2004, the people of Georgia will \n     celebrate the first anniversary of the Rose Revolution, the \n     peaceful and bloodless protests that followed parliamentary \n     elections deemed to be fraudulent;\n       Whereas following the resignation of President Eduard \n     Shevardnadze, Interim President Nino Burdzhanadze worked \n     diligently to restore order and to prepare Georgia for a new \n     Presidential election;\n       Whereas after a free, fair, and democratic election was \n     held, Mikheil Saakashvili was\n\n[[Page S11502]]\n\n     sworn into office on January 25, 2004, as President of \n     Georgia;\n       Whereas President Saakashvili visited the United States \n     Congress earlier this year and delivered a strong message of \n     peace, stability, democracy, political reform, and economic \n     opportunity;\n       Whereas Georgia is a small but strategically situated \n     country located in the Caucasus, and is of additional \n     interest to the United States because of the oil and gas \n     pipelines now being constructed from Baku, Azerbaijan to the \n     port of Ceyhan, Turkey;\n       Whereas Georgia has also become a key player in the global \n     war on terrorism by combating members of al Qaeda and other \n     Muslim terrorist organizations, denying them sanctuary in \n     remote areas such as the Pankisi Gorge, and working with the \n     United States to help train border guards;\n       Whereas Georgia has recently increased its commitment of \n     troops in Iraq and its contributions to help build peace and \n     democracy in Afghanistan and Kosovo;\n       Whereas the United States supports Georgia's efforts to \n     peacefully reestablish government control, security, and \n     political stability in regions such as Abkhazia and South \n     Ossetia;\n       Whereas the United States congratulates the Government of \n     Georgia on the peaceful resolution of the conflict in Adjara \n     and welcomes the restoration of democracy and political \n     stability in that region; and\n       Whereas the United States supports representative \n     democracy, political stability, economic growth, and peace in \n     Georgia and throughout the Caucasus region: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, that the Senate--\n       (1) congratulates the people of Georgia on the first \n     anniversary of the Rose Revolution, the peaceful and \n     bloodless protests that followed parliamentary elections \n     deemed to be fraudulent, and for their commitment to \n     democracy, peace, stability, and economic opportunity;\n       (2) commends President Mikheil Saakashvili for his vision \n     of, and commitment to, a peaceful and democratic Georgia, the \n     rule of law, an open market economy, regional cooperation, \n     and closer integration into western institutions;\n       (3) supports the sovereignty, independence, territorial \n     integrity, and democratic government of Georgia; and\n       (4) supports continued assistance to the people and \n     Government of Georgia to help them consolidate the democratic \n     process in their country.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 473--URGING THE GOVERNMENT OF UKRAINE TO ENSURE A \nDEMOCRATIC, TRANSPARENT, AND FAIR ELECTION PROCESS FOR THE PRESIDENTIAL \n                 RUN-OFF ELECTION ON NOVEMBER 21, 2004\n\n  Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Smith, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. \nGraham of South Carolina, Mr. Hagel, and Mr. Biden) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 473\n\n       Whereas the establishment of a democratic, transparent, and \n     fair election process for the 2004 Presidential election in \n     Ukraine and of a genuinely democratic political system are \n     prerequisites for that country's full integration into the \n     Western community of nations as an equal member, including \n     into organizations such as the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization (NATO);\n       Whereas the Government of Ukraine has accepted numerous \n     specific commitments governing the conduct of elections as a \n     participating state of the Organization for Security and \n     Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), including provisions of the \n     Copenhagen Document;\n       Whereas the election of Ukraine's next President will \n     provide an unambiguous test of the extent of the Ukrainian \n     authorities commitment to implement these standards and build \n     a democratic society based on free elections and the rule of \n     law;\n       Whereas the second round of the Presidential election takes \n     place against the backdrop of past elections and \n     improprieties in the first round of the election, which did \n     not fully meet international standards;\n       Whereas it is the duty of government and public authorities \n     of Ukraine at all levels to act in a manner consistent with \n     all laws and regulations governing election procedures, and \n     to ensure free and fair elections throughout the entire \n     country, including preventing activities aimed at undermining \n     the free exercise of political rights;\n       Whereas a genuinely free and fair election requires a \n     period of political campaigning conducted in an environment \n     in which administrative action, violence, intimidation, or \n     detention do not hinder the parties, political associations, \n     and the candidates from presenting their views and \n     qualifications to the citizenry, including organizing \n     supporters, conducting public meetings and events throughout \n     the country, and enjoying unimpeded access to television, \n     radio, print, and Internet media on a non-discriminatory \n     basis;\n       Whereas a genuinely free and fair election requires that \n     citizens be guaranteed the right and effective opportunity to \n     exercise their civil and political rights, including the \n     right to vote and the right to seek and acquire information \n     upon which to make an informed vote, free from intimidation, \n     undue influence, attempts at vote buying, threats of \n     political retribution, or other forms of coercion by national \n     or local authorities or others;\n       Whereas a genuinely free and fair election requires \n     government and public authorities to ensure that candidates \n     and political parties enjoy equal treatment before the law \n     and that government resources are not employed to the \n     advantage of individual candidates or political parties;\n       Whereas a genuinely free and fair election requires the \n     full transparency of laws and regulations governing \n     elections, multiparty representation on election commissions, \n     and unobstructed access by candidates, political parties, and \n     domestic and international observers to all election \n     procedures, including voting and vote counting in all areas \n     of the country;\n       Whereas increasing control and manipulation of the media by \n     national and local officials and others acting at their \n     behest raise grave concerns regarding the commitment of the \n     Ukrainian authorities to free and fair elections;\n       Whereas efforts by the national authorities in Ukraine to \n     limit access to international broadcasting, including Radio \n     Liberty and the Voice of America, represent an unacceptable \n     infringement on the right of the Ukrainian people to \n     independent information;\n       Whereas efforts by national and local officials of Ukraine \n     and others acting at their behest to impose obstacles to free \n     assembly, free speech, and a free and fair political campaign \n     have taken place in Donetsk, Sumy, and elsewhere in Ukraine \n     without condemnation or remedial action by the Government of \n     Ukraine;\n       Whereas numerous substantial irregularities have taken \n     place in recent Ukrainian parliamentary by-elections in the \n     Donetsk region and in mayoral elections in Mukacheve, Romny, \n     and Krasniy Luch;\n       Whereas intimidation, violence, and fraud during the April \n     18, 2004, mayoral election in Mukacheve, Ukraine, represent a \n     deliberate attack on the democratic process;\n       Whereas in the period leading to the first round of the \n     Presidential election, the government power structures used \n     state resources such as schools, state factories, hospitals, \n     and public transport systems to force students, state \n     workers, and citizens who rely on state services for their \n     livelihood to campaign against their will for the government-\n     backed candidate;\n       Whereas there was notable partisan engagement of security \n     services, military, and local police in support of the \n     government-backed candidate;\n       Whereas there was a failure of national and local state-\n     owned and private electronic media to provide impartial and \n     fair coverage of, or access to, opposition candidates;\n       Whereas some election commission members affiliated with \n     opposition candidates were dismissed from their duties just \n     prior to election day;\n       Whereas there was collaboration with a foreign government \n     to allow a foreign President to appear in Ukraine and express \n     his opinions on one of the candidates just days before \n     election day, in an effort to influence the vote, and a \n     military parade, which was held in Kyiv 3 days prior to the \n     election, was clearly an effort to intimidate voters; and\n       Whereas in the first round of the Presidential election in \n     Ukraine that occurred on October 31, 2004, international \n     observers noted fraud and other significant problems, \n     including poorly maintained voter lists, which resulted in \n     people being denied their right to vote, as well as many \n     additional names on voter rolls for which no accounting could \n     be made, prevalent interference by unauthorized persons into \n     the electoral process, and credible reports of busing of \n     voters among oblasts and polling stations for the purpose of \n     multiple voting: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) acknowledges and welcomes the strong relationship \n     formed between the United States and Ukraine since the \n     restoration of Ukraine's independence in 1991;\n       (2) recognizes that a precondition for the full integration \n     of Ukraine into the Western community of nations, including \n     as an equal member in institutions such as the North Atlantic \n     Treaty Organization (NATO), is its establishment of a \n     genuinely democratic political system;\n       (3) expresses its strong and continuing support for the \n     efforts of the Ukrainian people to establish a full \n     democracy, the rule of law, and respect for human rights in \n     Ukraine;\n       (4) urges the Government of Ukraine to guarantee freedom of \n     association and assembly, including the right of candidates, \n     members of political parties, and others to freely assemble, \n     to organize and conduct public events, and to exercise these \n     and other rights free from intimidation or harassment by \n     local or national officials or others acting at their behest;\n       (5) urges the Government of Ukraine to meet its \n     Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) \n     commitments on democratic elections and to address issues \n     previously identified by the Office of Democratic \n     Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) of the OSCE in its \n     final reports on the 2002 parliamentary elections and the \n     1999 Presidential elections, such as illegal interference by \n     public authorities in the campaign and a high degree of bias \n     in the media;\n\n[[Page S11503]]\n\n       (6) urges the Ukrainian authorities to ensure--\n       (A) the full transparency of election procedures before, \n     during, and after the second round of the 2004 Presidential \n     election;\n       (B) free access for Ukrainian and international election \n     observers;\n       (C) multiparty representation on all election commissions;\n       (D) unimpeded access by all parties and candidates to \n     print, radio, television, and Internet media on a non-\n     discriminatory basis;\n       (E) freedom of candidates, members of opposition parties, \n     and independent media organizations from intimidation or \n     harassment by government officials at all levels, including \n     selective tax audits and other regulatory procedures, and in \n     the case of media, license revocations, and libel suits;\n       (F) a transparent process for complaint and appeals through \n     electoral commissions and within the court system that \n     provides timely and effective remedies;\n       (G) vigorous prosecution of any individual or organization \n     responsible for violations of election laws or regulations, \n     including the application of appropriate administrative or \n     criminal penalties;\n       (H) remedies to all improprieties reported in the first \n     round of the Presidential election in Ukraine, including--\n       (i) the replacement at a polling station of any Territorial \n     Election Commission member found to have engaged in fraud;\n       (ii) a complete review of voter lists in each polling \n     station in order to correct inaccuracies;\n       (iii) equal time on state media and equal access to private \n     media for the two runoff candidates; and\n       (iv) immediate prosecution of individuals who have violated \n     the election law;\n       (7) further calls upon the Government of Ukraine to \n     guarantee election monitors from the ODIHR, other \n     participating states of the OSCE, Ukrainian political \n     parties, representatives of candidates, nongovernmental \n     organizations, and other private institutions and \n     organizations, both foreign and domestic, unobstructed access \n     to all aspects of the election process, including unimpeded \n     access to public campaign events, candidates, news media, \n     voting, and post-election tabulation of results and \n     processing of election challenges and complaints;\n       (8) urges the President to fully employ the diplomatic and \n     other resources of the Government of the United States to \n     encourage the Government of Ukraine to ensure that the \n     election laws and procedures of Ukraine are faithfully \n     adhered to by all local and national officials, by others \n     acting at their behest, and by all candidates and parties, \n     during and subsequent to the Presidential campaign and \n     election-day voting;\n       (9) strongly encourages the President to clearly \n     communicate to the Government of Ukraine, to all parties and \n     candidates in Ukraine, and to the people of Ukraine the high \n     importance attached by the Government of the United States to \n     this Presidential campaign as a central factor in determining \n     the future relationship between the two countries;\n       (10) strongly encourages the President to consider visa \n     bans and other targeted sanctions on those responsible for \n     encouraging or participating in any efforts to improperly \n     influence the outcome of the election, whether through direct \n     or indirect involvement; and\n       (11) pledges its enduring support and assistance to the \n     people of Ukraine for the establishment of a fully free and \n     open democratic system, the creation of a prosperous free \n     market economy, the establishment of a secure independence \n     and freedom from coercion, and Ukraine's assumption of its \n     rightful place as a full and equal member of the Western \n     community of democracies.\n

and\n       Whereas before his passing on October 6, 2004, Yogi Bhajan \n     requested that his passing be a time of celebration of his \n     going home: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) recognizes that the teachings of Yogi Bhajan about \n     Sikhism and yoga, and the businesses formed under his \n     inspiration, improved the personal, political, spiritual, and \n     professional relations between citizens of the United States \n     and the citizens of India;\n       (2) recognizes the legendary compassion, wisdom, kindness, \n     and courage of Yogi Bhajan, and his wealth of accomplishments \n     on behalf of the Sikh community; and\n       (3) extends its condolences to Inderjit Kaur, the wife of \n     Yogi Bhajan, his 3 children and 5 grandchildren, and to Sikh \n     and ``Healthy, Happy, Holy Organization (3HO)'' communities \n     around the Nation and the world upon the death on October 6, \n     2004, of Yogi Bhajan, an individual who was a wise teacher \n     and mentor, an outstanding pioneer, a champion of peace, and \n     a compassionate human being.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues, \nSenators Domenici and Cornyn, to introduce a resolution honoring the \nlife of Yogi Bhajan. Yogi Bhajan, the chief religious and \nadministrative authority for Sikhism in the West, died in Espanola, NM, \non October 6, 2004, at the age of 75. Born Harbhajan Singh Puri on \nAugust 26, 1929, in Northern India, now Pakistan, he began yogic \ntraining at age 8 and was proclaimed a master of Kundalini Yoga by age \n16. After the partition of India and Pakistan in 1947, his family \nmigrated to New Delhi, India, where he continued his education. after \ngraduating from Punjab University in economics, he worked for India's \nInternal Revenue Service and later became head of customs at the New \nDelhi Airport.\n  Yogi Bhajan introduced thousands around the world to Sikhism, a \nreligion that carries the message of truthful living and the \nfundamental unity of humanity, and reaches out to people of all \nbackgrounds to work together for world peace. When he came to North \nAmerica in 1968, he recognized that the experience sought by many young \npeople through drugs could be alternatively achieved through Kundalini \nYoga, which stimulates individual growth through breath, chanting, and \nmeditation among other components. Breaking the centuries old tradition \nof secrecy surrounding Kundalini Yoga, he began teaching it publicly. \nSoon after, he founded the Healthy, Happy, Holy Organization (3HO), a \nnonprofit private educational and scientific foundation with 300 \ncenters in 35 countries, dedicated to improving physical well-being, \ndeepening spiritual awareness, and offering guidance on matters of \nhealth and heart. He later founded 3HO SuperHealth, a successful drug \nrehabilitation program, blending ancient yogic wisdom of the East with \nthe modern technology of the West. SuperHealth was accredited by the \nJoint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organization and \nreceived its highest commendation. In 1973 it distinguished itself as \nbeing in the top 10 percent of all treatment programs throughout the \nUnited States. In 1989 Yogi Bhajan met with then President Mikhail \nGorbachev and established addiction treatment programs in Russia based \non the 3HO SuperHealth model. Currently a pilot project of SuperHealth \nis being formed by the Punjab State Government in India. He taught Yoga \nin Toronto and Los Angeles and finally founded a Sikh Dharma community \nin Espanola, NM. In 1971, the president of the governing body of Sikh \nTemples in India gave Yogi Bhajan the title of chief religious and \nadministrative authority for Sikhism in the Western Hemisphere. About \n250,000 Sikhs now reside across the United States, including a \ncommunity of about 500 families in Northern New Mexico.\n  Yogi Bhajan wrote 30 books and inspired 200 more through his \nteaching, and inspired the founding of several businesses, including \nAkal Security Inc. He had an inclusive view of the world's major \nreligions and considered all of them valid. Throughout his lifetime, he \ntraveled the world and met with world leaders such as Pope John Paul II \nand the Dalai Lama to discuss world peace and religious unity. In June \n1985, Yogi Bhajan established the first International Peace Prayer Day \nCelebration in New Mexico that stills draws thousands of participants \nannually.\n  After the events of 9/11/01, Yogi Bhajan reached out to Sikhs across \nAmerica, encouraging and helping them to educate their fellow citizens \nabout Sikhs, and to work with law enforcement and community leaders to \nhelp them protect Sikh populations. His efforts have helped contribute \nto the opening of some major law enforcement agencies to Sikh \nemployees, including the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. Yogi \nBhajan established links to human rights advocates nationwide, working \nto make sure that the issue of Sikh identity is understood and \nrespected. When Balbir Singh Sodhi was murdered in Phoenix 5 days after \n9/11 because of his beard and turban, Yogi Bhajan worked with community \nand government leaders in Arizona to help raise awareness about the \nSikh community there.\n  Yogi Bhajan is survived by his wife, Inderjit Kaur; two sons, Ranbir \nSingh and Kulbir Singh; a daughter, Kamaljit Kaur; and five \ngrandchildren. He will be missed by his family, followers and his \nfriends, and his contribution to the cause of world peace will be \nremembered and celebrated for generations to come.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 149--COMMENDING THE NATIONAL OCEANIC AND \n  ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION AND ITS EMPLOYEES FOR ITS DEDICATION AND \n     HARD WORK DURING HURRICANES CHARLEY, FRANCES, IVAN, AND JEANNE\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS (for himself, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. Lott, and Mr. \nBreaux) submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nconsidered and agreed to:\n\n                            S.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 471, submitted \nearlier today by Senator Durbin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 471) authorizing the printing of \n     tributes and other related materials in honor of the late \n     Senator Paul Simon.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, as we approach the first anniversary of \nthe death of Senator Paul Simon, I would like to take this opportunity \nto pay tribute to my late friend and colleague.\n  At the age of 19, Paul Simon became the Nation's youngest editor-\npublisher when he accepted a Lion's Club challenge to save the Troy \nTribune in Troy,\n\n[[Page S11507]]\n\nIL. From that start, he build a chain of 13 newspapers in southern and \ncentral Illinois.\n  Paul Simon served the State of Illinois and the United States for \ndecades. He is the only individual to have served in both the Illinois \nHouse of Representatives and the Illinois Senate, and the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives and U.S. Senate.\n  Paul highly valued education and the youth of our Nation. In addition \nto his work in Congress to strengthen public education in America, he \nstarted the public affairs reporting program at Sangamon State \nUniversity, now the University of Illinois at Springfield. He later \nbecame the founder and director of the Public Policy Institute at \nSouthern Illinois University in Carbondale, IL, and taught there for \nmore than 6 years.\n  Weeks before his death, Paul made the rounds to Washington and the \neditorial boards in Chicago. He was promoting an idea to create a new \nscholarship program which would send American students overseas to \nstudy and invite their foreign counterparts to come to America to \nlearn. As Paul explained it, this opportunity to learn would help an \noften hostile world to understand us and help the next generation of \nAmerican leaders to understand the world we live in. It was Paul \nSimon's long-term solution to the threat of terrorism: dialogue, \neducation and tolerance--the hallmarks of his public life. In a modest \nway, we came through for him.\n  Earlier this year, this Congress established a commission to \nrecommend the framework for an international study abroad program for \ncollege students. The program Senator Simon envisioned and worked so \nhard to create was what he called the Lincoln Fellowships. The program \nunder development is designed to encourage and support the experience \nof studying abroad in developing countries--in countries whose people, \nculture, language, government, and religion might be very different \nfrom ours.\n  Shortly after Paul's death, I introduced legislation to name the \nFederal building located at 250 West Cherry Street in Carbondale, IL, \nthe ``Senator Paul Simon Federal Building.'' In May 2004, this bill was \nsigned into law. Naming this building in Carbondale after Paul Simon \nwill help present and future generations remember and honor a great man \nwho lived in and worked for the people of Southern Illinois and served \nin our Federal Government with the greatest integrity.\n  From journalism to Government to education, Paul Simon set the \nstandard for honesty and caring in public life. Paul set a standard for \nintegrity in public life the rest of us can only aspire to. Whether you \nagreed with his politics or not, you always knew you could trust Paul. \nHe didn't apologize for dedicating his public life to the less \nfortunate. He believed and taught those of us who worked with him that \nhonesty and caring were the real standards for public service. He was \ngenuine in his politics, in his life, and in his values.\n  I wouldn't be a Senator today if it weren't for Paul Simon. He \nbelieved in me, he inspired me, and he was a true friend.\n  Today I am introducing a resolution to authorize the printing of \ntributes and other related materials in honor of Senator Simon. This \nresolution will authorize the collection and printing of these \nmaterials in an official Senate document. The compilation of the \ntribute statements made by my Senate colleagues will serve as a lasting \ntestament to our former colleague.\n  Through these small measures, Congress has paid tribute to the \nlasting legacy of our friend, Paul Simon. His dedication to public \nservice serves as an example for all Americans.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and that any statements relating thereto be printed in the \nRecord, without intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 471) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n                              S.

Res. 441\n\n       Whereas the Coos, Lower Umpqua, and Siuslaw Restoration Act \n     (25 U.S.C. 714 et seq.), which was signed by the President on \n     October 17, 1984, restored Federal recognition to the \n     Confederated Tribes of Coos, Lower Umpqua, and Siuslaw \n     Indians;\n       Whereas the Confederated Tribes of Coos, Lower Umpqua, and \n     Siuslaw Indians historically inhabited land now in the State \n     of Oregon, from Fivemile Point in the south to Tenmile Creek \n     in the north, west to the Pacific Ocean, then east to the \n     crest of the Coast Range, encompassing the watersheds of the \n     Coos River, the Umpqua River to Weatherly Creek, the Siuslaw \n     River, the coastal tributaries between Tenmile Creek and \n     Fivemile Point, and portions of the Coquille watershed;\n       Whereas in addition to restoring Federal recognition, that \n     Act and other Federal Indian statutes have provided the means \n     for the Confederated Tribes to achieve the goals of cultural \n     restoration, economic self-sufficiency, and the attainment of \n     a standard of living equivalent to that enjoyed by other \n     citizens of the United States;\n       Whereas by enacting the Coos, Lower Umpqua, and Siuslaw \n     Restoration Act (25 U.S.C. 714 et seq.), the Federal \n     Government--\n       (1) declared that the Confederated Tribes of Coos, Lower \n     Umpqua, and Siuslaw Indians were eligible for all Federal \n     services and benefits provided to federally recognized \n     tribes;\n       (2) provided the means to establish a tribal reservation; \n     and\n       (3) granted the Confederated Tribes of Coos, Lower Umpqua, \n     and Siuslaw Indians self-government for the betterment of \n     tribal members, including the ability to set tribal rolls;\n       Whereas the Confederated Tribes of Coos, Lower Umpqua, and \n     Siuslaw Indians have embraced Federal recognition and self-\n     sufficiency statutes and are actively working to better the \n     lives of tribal members; and\n       Whereas economic self-sufficiency, which was the goal of \n     restoring Federal recognition for the Confederated Tribes of \n     Coos, Lower Umpqua, and Siuslaw Indians, is being realized \n     through many projects: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that October \n     17, 1984, should be memorialized as the date on which the \n     Federal Government restored Federal recognition to the \n     Confederated Tribes of Coos, Lower Umpqua, and Siuslaw \n     Indians.\n\n                              S.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       [This Act may be cited as the ``Elder Fall Prevention Act \n     of 2003''.\n\n     [SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       [The Congress finds as follows:\n       [(1) Falls are the leading cause of injury deaths among \n     individuals who are over 65 years of age.\n       [(2) By 2030, the population of individuals who are 65 \n     years of age or older will double. By 2050, the population of \n     individuals who are 85 years of age or older will quadruple.\n       [(3) In 2000, falls among elderly individuals accounted for \n     10,200 deaths and 1,600,000 emergency department visits.\n       [(4) Sixty percent of fall-related deaths occur among \n     individuals who are 75 years of age or older.\n       [(5) Twenty-five percent of elderly persons who sustain a \n     hip fracture die within 1 year.\n       [(6) Hospital admissions for hip fractures among the \n     elderly have increased from 231,000 admissions in 1988 to \n     332,000 in 1999. The number of hip fractures is expected to \n     exceed 500,000 by 2040.\n       [(7) Annually, more than 64,000 individuals who are over 65 \n     years of age sustain a traumatic brain injury as a result of \n     a fall.\n       [(8) Annually, 40,000 individuals who are over 65 years of \n     age visit emergency departments with traumatic brain injuries \n     suffered as a result of a fall, of which 16,000 of these \n     individual are hospitalized and 4,000 of these individuals \n     die.\n       [(9) The rate of fall-induced traumatic brain injuries for \n     individual who are 80 years of age or older increased by 60 \n     percent from 1989 to 1998.\n       [(10) The estimated total cost for non-fatal traumatic \n     brain injury-related hospitalizations for falls in \n     individuals who are 65 years of age or older is more than \n     $3,250,000,000. Two-thirds of these costs occurred among \n     individual who were 75 years of age or older.\n       [(11) The costs to the Medicare and Medicaid programs and \n     society as a whole from falls by elderly persons continue to \n     climb much faster than inflation and population growth. \n     Direct costs alone will exceed $32,000,000,000 in 2020.\n       [(12) The Federal Government should devote additional \n     resources to research regarding the prevention and treatment \n     of falls in residential as well as institutional settings.\n       [(13) A national approach to reducing elder falls, which \n     focuses on the daily life of senior citizens in residential, \n     institutional, and community settings is needed.

Mr. President, I am pleased that today the Senate will \npass the Keeping Seniors Safe from Falls Act of 2004 (S. 1217) that \nSenator Enzi and I introduced. Falls are a serious public health \nproblem that affects millions of seniors each year. This bill focuses \non public education, research, and demonstration projects to help \nreduce falls by older adults.\n  The facts are staggering. One out of every three Americans over age \n65 falls every year. In 2000, over 10,200 seniors died and \napproximately 1.6 million seniors visited an emergency department as a \nresult of a fall. Falls are the leading cause of injury deaths among \nseniors, accounting for 64,000 traumatic brain injuries and 340,000 hip \nfractures each year. Falls can be financially disastrous for families, \nand falls place a serious financial strain on our health care system. \nBy 2020, falls by older adults are estimated to cost the health care \nsystem more than $32 billion.\n  These facts do not begin to tell the story of what falls can mean for \nolder adults and their loved ones. Falls don't discriminate. Kay Graham \nwas the victim of a fall. Many of us have friends or relatives who have \nfallen. A fall can have a devastating impact on a person's physical, \nemotional, and mental health. If an older woman loses her footing on \nher front porch steps, falls, and suffers a hip fracture, she would \nlikely spend about two weeks in the hospital, and there is a 50 percent \nchance that she would not return home or live independently as a result \nof her injuries.\n  Two years ago, I chaired a hearing of the Subcommittee on Aging on \nthe problem of falls among older adults. The subcommittee heard \ntestimony from Lillie Marie Struchen, a 91-year-old woman who had \nrecently fallen in her bathroom when she slipped on the tile. Lillie \nMarie could not reach the panic button in her apartment, and it took \nher some time before she could get to her feet and call for help. \nLillie Marie was lucky. She recovered from her fall and returned to her \nnormal routines. She shared with the subcommittee some steps that she \nand her family have taken to prevent future falls, knowing that she may \nnot be so lucky next time.\n  These falls, like the ones that Lillie Marie and thousands of others \nsuffer from each year, can be prevented. With some help, there are \nsimple ways that seniors can improve the safety of their homes and make \na fall far less likely. Home modifications like hand rails in the \nbathroom, rubber mats on slippery tile floors, and cordless telephones \nthat seniors can keep nearby can make a big difference. Well-trained \npharmacists can review medications to make sure that two drugs do not \ninteract to cause dizziness and throw a senior off balance.\n  That's what this legislation is about--getting behind our Nation's \nseniors and giving help to those who practice self-help. This bill \ncreates public education campaigns for older adults, their families, \nand health care providers about how to prevent falls. It expands \nresearch on falls by older adults to develop better ways to prevent \nfalls and to improve the treatment and rehabilitation of elder victims. \nThis legislation also requires an evaluation of the effect of falls on \nhealth care costs, the potential for reducing falls, and the potential \nfor reducing health care costs associated with falls.\n  Reducing the number of falls will help seniors live longer, \nhealthier, more independent lives. I want to acknowledge the leadership \nof the National Safety Council on this issue. I also thank Senator Enzi \nfor working with me in such a bipartisan manner to move this bill \nforward. The support of Senator Gregg and Senator Kennedy was also \nvital in getting this bill through the Senate. I hope that our \ncolleagues in the House will take swift action to pass this important \nbill this year.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Res. 123\n\n       Whereas Alexander Hamilton dedicated his life to serving \n     his adopted country as a Revolutionary soldier, aide-de-camp \n     to General George Washington, Representative to the \n     Continental Congress, member of the New York State Assembly, \n     first Secretary of the Treasury of the United States, and \n     Inspector General of the Army;\n       Whereas Alexander Hamilton was a poor teenage immigrant to \n     New York from the West Indian Islands of Nevis and St. Croix;\n       Whereas in the early days of the Revolutionary War \n     Alexander Hamilton was commissioned as a captain and raised \n     and trained his own New York artillery regiment and served \n     valiantly in the battles of Long Island and Manhattan;\n       Whereas Alexander Hamilton quickly captured the attention \n     of General George Washington who made him his aide-de-camp \n     and confidant throughout the most difficult days of the \n     Revolutionary War;\n       Whereas in 1781, Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Hamilton of \n     the Continental Army led a bold attack of New York troops \n     during the siege of Yorktown, the decisive and final battle \n     of the Revolutionary War;\n       Whereas in 1782, Alexander Hamilton was elected as a member \n     of the Continental Congress from New York;\n       Whereas as a private citizen Alexander Hamilton served many \n     philanthropic causes and was a co-founder of the New York \n     Manumission Society, the first abolitionist organization in \n     New York and a major influence on the abolition of slavery \n     from the State;\n       Whereas Alexander Hamilton was a strong and consistent \n     advocate against slavery and believed that Blacks and Whites \n     were equal citizens and equal in their mental and physical \n     faculties;\n       Whereas Alexander Hamilton was one of the first members of \n     the founding generation to call for a convention to \n     drastically revise the Articles of Confederation;\n       Whereas Alexander Hamilton joined James Madison in \n     Annapolis, Maryland in 1786 to officially request that the \n     States call a constitutional convention;\n       Whereas Alexander Hamilton was elected as a delegate to the \n     Constitutional Convention of 1787 from New York, where he \n     played an influential role and was the only delegate from New \n     York to sign the Constitution;\n       Whereas Alexander Hamilton was the primary author of the \n     Federalist Papers, the single most influential interpretation \n     of American constitutional law ever written;\n       Whereas Alexander Hamilton was the most important \n     individual force in achieving the ratification of the \n     Constitution in New York against the strong opposition of \n     many of the delegates to the ratifying convention;\n       Whereas Alexander Hamilton was the leading voice of the \n     founding generation in support of the controversial doctrine \n     of judicial review, which is the backbone for the role of the \n     Supreme Court in the constitutional system of the United \n     States;\n       Whereas on September 11, 1789, Alexander Hamilton was \n     appointed by President George Washington to be the first \n     Secretary of the Treasury;\n       Whereas as Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton \n     salvaged the public credit, created the first Bank of the \n     United States, and outlined the basic economic vision of a \n     mixed agricultural and manufacturing society supported by a \n     strong financial system that would underlie the great \n     economic expansion of the United States for the next 2 \n     centuries;\n       Whereas Alexander Hamilton was the leading proponent among \n     the Founding Fathers of encouraging a strong manufacturing \n     base for the United States in order to create good paying \n     middle-class jobs and encourage a society built on merit \n     rather than class or skin color;\n       Whereas in pursuit of this vision Alexander Hamilton \n     founded The Society for Establishing Useful Manufactures \n     which in turn founded the town of Paterson, New Jersey, one \n     of the first industrial centers of the United States;\n       Whereas Alexander Hamilton proposed and oversaw the \n     creation of the Coast Guard for law enforcement in \n     territorial waters of the United States;\n       Whereas in 1798, President John Adams called upon Alexander \n     Hamilton to raise an army in preparation for a possible war \n     with France and, as Inspector General of the Army, he trained \n     a powerful force of well-equipped soldiers who were able to \n     help deter war at this vulnerable stage in the founding of \n     the United States;\n       Whereas throughout the founding era Alexander Hamilton was \n     the leading advocate of a strong national union led by an \n     efficient Federal Government with significant protections for \n     individual liberties;\n       Whereas on July 11, 1804, Alexander Hamilton was fatally \n     wounded in a duel in Weehawken, New Jersey at the hands of \n     Vice President Aaron Burr; and\n       Whereas Alexander Hamilton died in Manhattan on July 12, \n     1804, and was eulogized across the country as one of the \n     leading visionaries of the founding era: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) honors the great importance of the life and legacy of \n     Alexander Hamilton to the United States of America on the \n     bicentennial of his death;\n       (2) recognizes the tremendous significance of the \n     contributions of Alexander Hamilton to the United States as a \n     soldier, citizen, and statesman; and\n       (3) urges the people of the United States to share in this \n     commemoration so as to gain a greater appreciation of the \n     critical role that Alexander Hamilton had in defense of \n     America's freedom and the founding of the United States.\n\n                              S. Res. 436\n\n       Whereas approximately 80,000 infants, children, teenagers, \n     and young adults of families living throughout the United \n     States die each year from myriad causes;\n       Whereas the death of an infant, child, teenager, or young \n     adult of a family is considered to be one of the greatest \n     tragedies that a prevent or family will ever endure during a \n     lifetime;\n       Whereas a supportive environment, empathy, and \n     understanding are considered critical factors in the healing \n     process of a family that is coping with and recovering from \n     the loss of a loved one; and\n       Whereas April is National Child Abuse Prevention month: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n     Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF NATIONAL CHILDREN'S MEMORIAL DAY.\n\n       The Senate--\n       (1) designates the second Sunday in the month of December \n     2004 as ``National Children's Memorial Day''; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling upon the people of the United States to observe \n     ``National Children's Memorial Day'' with appropriate \n     ceremonies and activities in remembrance of the many infants, \n     children, teenagers, and young adults of families in the \n     United States who have died.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/18/senate-section/article/S11511-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11511-S11512]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                FIRST ANNIVERSARY OF THE ROSE REVOLUTION\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Res. 473\n\n       Whereas the establishment of a democratic, transparent, and \n     fair election process for the 2004 Presidential election in \n     Ukraine and of a genuinely democratic political system are \n     prerequisites for that country's full integration into the \n     Western community of nations as an equal member, including \n     into organizations such as the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization (NATO);\n       Whereas the Government of Ukraine has accepted numerous \n     specific commitments governing the conduct of elections as a \n     participating state of the Organization for Security and \n     Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), including provisions of the \n     Copenhagen Document;\n       Whereas the election of Ukraine's next President will \n     provide an unambiguous test of the extent of the Ukrainian \n     authorities commitment to implement these standards and build \n     a democratic society based on free elections and the rule of \n     law;\n       Whereas the second round of the Presidential election takes \n     place against the backdrop of past elections and \n     improprieties in the first round of the election, which did \n     not fully meet international standards;\n       Whereas it is the duty of government and public authorities \n     of Ukraine at all levels to act in a manner consistent with \n     all laws and regulations governing election procedures, and \n     to ensure free and fair elections throughout the entire \n     country, including preventing activities aimed at undermining \n     the free exercise of political rights;\n       Whereas a genuinely free and fair election requires a \n     period of political campaigning conducted in an environment \n     in which administrative action, violence, intimidation, or \n     detention do not hinder the parties, political associations, \n     and the candidates from presenting their views and \n     qualifications to the citizenry, including organizing \n     supporters, conducting public meetings and events throughout \n     the country, and enjoying unimpeded access to television, \n     radio, print, and Internet media on a non-discriminatory \n     basis;\n       Whereas a genuinely free and fair election requires that \n     citizens be guaranteed the right and effective opportunity to \n     exercise their civil and political rights, including the \n     right to vote and the right to seek and acquire information \n     upon which to make an informed vote, free from intimidation, \n     undue influence, attempts at vote buying, threats of \n     political retribution, or other forms of coercion by national \n     or local authorities or others;\n       Whereas a genuinely free and fair election requires \n     government and public authorities to ensure that candidates \n     and political parties enjoy equal treatment before the law \n     and that government resources are not employed to the \n     advantage of individual candidates or political parties;\n       Whereas a genuinely free and fair election requires the \n     full transparency of laws and regulations governing \n     elections, multiparty representation on election commissions, \n     and unobstructed access by candidates, political parties, and \n     domestic and international observers to all election \n     procedures, including voting and vote counting in all areas \n     of the country;\n       Whereas increasing control and manipulation of the media by \n     national and local officials and others acting at their \n     behest raise grave concerns regarding the commitment of the \n     Ukrainian authorities to free and fair elections;\n       Whereas efforts by the national authorities in Ukraine to \n     limit access to international broadcasting, including Radio \n     Liberty and the Voice of America, represent an unacceptable \n     infringement on the right of the Ukrainian people to \n     independent information;\n       Whereas efforts by national and local officials of Ukraine \n     and others acting at their behest to impose obstacles to free \n     assembly, free speech, and a free and fair political campaign \n     have taken place in Donetsk, Sumy, and elsewhere in Ukraine \n     without condemnation or remedial action by the Government of \n     Ukraine;\n       Whereas numerous substantial irregularities have taken \n     place in recent Ukrainian parliamentary by-elections in the \n     Donetsk region and in mayoral elections in Mukacheve, Romny, \n     and Krasniy Luch;\n       Whereas intimidation, violence, and fraud during the April \n     18, 2004, mayoral election in Mukacheve, Ukraine, represent a \n     deliberate attack on the democratic process;\n       Whereas in the period leading to the first round of the \n     Presidential election, the government power structures used \n     state resources such as schools, state factories, hospitals, \n     and public transport systems to force students, state \n     workers, and citizens who rely on state services for their \n     livelihood to campaign against their will for the government-\n     backed candidate;\n       Whereas there was notable partisan engagement of security \n     services, military, and local police in support of the \n     government-backed candidate;\n       Whereas there was a failure of national and local state-\n     owned and private electronic media to provide impartial and \n     fair coverage of, or access to, opposition candidates;\n       Whereas some election commission members affiliated with \n     opposition candidates were dismissed from their duties just \n     prior to election day;\n       Whereas there was collaboration with a foreign government \n     to allow a foreign President to appear in Ukraine and express \n     his opinions on one of the candidates just days before \n     election day, in an effort to influence the vote, and a \n     military parade, which was held in Kyiv 3 days prior to the \n     election, was clearly an effort to intimidate voters; and\n       Whereas in the first round of the Presidential election in \n     Ukraine that occurred on October 31, 2004, international \n     observers noted fraud and other significant problems, \n     including poorly maintained voter lists, which resulted in \n     people being denied their right to vote, as well as many \n     additional names on voter rolls for which no accounting could \n     be made, prevalent interference by unauthorized persons into \n     the electoral process, and credible reports of busing of \n     voters among oblasts and polling stations for the purpose of \n     multiple voting: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) acknowledges and welcomes the strong relationship \n     formed between the United States and Ukraine since the \n     restoration of Ukraine's independence in 1991;\n       (2) recognizes that a precondition for the full integration \n     of Ukraine into the Western community of nations, including \n     as an equal member in institutions such as the North Atlantic \n     Treaty Organization (NATO), is its establishment of a \n     genuinely democratic political system;\n       (3) expresses its strong and continuing support for the \n     efforts of the Ukrainian people to establish a full \n     democracy, the rule of law, and respect for human rights in \n     Ukraine;\n       (4) urges the Government of Ukraine to guarantee freedom of \n     association and assembly, including the right of candidates, \n     members of political parties, and others to freely assemble, \n     to organize and conduct public events, and to exercise these \n     and other rights free from intimidation or harassment by \n     local or national officials or others acting at their behest;\n\n[[Page S11513]]\n\n       (5) urges the Government of Ukraine to meet its \n     Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) \n     commitments on democratic elections and to address issues \n     previously identified by the Office of Democratic \n     Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) of the OSCE in its \n     final reports on the 2002 parliamentary elections and the \n     1999 Presidential elections, such as illegal interference by \n     public authorities in the campaign and a high degree of bias \n     in the media;\n       (6) urges the Ukrainian authorities to ensure--\n       (A) the full transparency of election procedures before, \n     during, and after the second round of the 2004 Presidential \n     election;\n       (B) free access for Ukrainian and international election \n     observers;\n       (C) multiparty representation on all election commissions;\n       (D) unimpeded access by all parties and candidates to \n     print, radio, television, and Internet media on a non-\n     discriminatory basis;\n       (E) freedom of candidates, members of opposition parties, \n     and independent media organizations from intimidation or \n     harassment by government officials at all levels, including \n     selective tax audits and other regulatory procedures, and in \n     the case of media, license revocations, and libel suits;\n       (F) a transparent process for complaint and appeals through \n     electoral commissions and within the court system that \n     provides timely and effective remedies;\n       (G) vigorous prosecution of any individual or organization \n     responsible for violations of election laws or regulations, \n     including the application of appropriate administrative or \n     criminal penalties;\n       (H) remedies to all improprieties reported in the first \n     round of the Presidential election in Ukraine, including--\n       (i) the replacement at a polling station of any Territorial \n     Election Commission member found to have engaged in fraud;\n       (ii) a complete review of voter lists in each polling \n     station in order to correct inaccuracies;\n       (iii) equal time on state media and equal access to private \n     media for the two runoff candidates; and\n       (iv) immediate prosecution of individuals who have violated \n     the election law;\n       (7) further calls upon the Government of Ukraine to \n     guarantee election monitors from the ODIHR, other \n     participating states of the OSCE, Ukrainian political \n     parties, representatives of candidates, nongovernmental \n     organizations, and
