Under the previous order, there are \nnow 20 minutes equally divided for consideration of amendments Nos. 571 \nand 572, with the time controlled by the Senator from Virginia, Mr. \nWarner, or his designee, and the Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. Reed, \nor his designee.\n  Who seeks time?\n  The Senator from the great State of Colorado.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 752 to Amendment No. 751\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Warner second-\ndegree amendment to the Reed amendment in the form of a substitute.\n  The amendment would strike the Reed-Levin amendment, thereby \nretaining the repeal of the ban on research and development of low-\nyield nuclear weapons that is in the committee bill. The amendment \nwould also require that the Department of Energy receive an \nauthorization from the Congress for engineering development, and all \nsubsequent phases of weapons development, before commencing with such \nactivities. This amendment would make it absolutely clear that it is \nthe prerogative of Congress to decide on the funding necessary for the \nadministration to proceed with engineering development of a low-yield \nnuclear weapon, but it will not stop the military planners and weapon \ndesigners from considering and proposing such development.\n  Even after repealing the ban, as we did in the committee bill, the \nadministration is still required to specifically request funding at \neach phase of research and development, as required by the National \nDefense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2003. With this amendment, \nthe Department of Energy would be required to receive an authorization \nfrom Congress before commencing with the engineering development of \nlow-yield nuclear weapons. Congress would have another opportunity to \nreview such activities if they are requested by the administration.\n  This amendment provides for appropriate congressional review and \noversight without incurring the disadvantages of an outright ban on \nsome portions of research and development. Retaining a ban on \ndevelopment, acquisition, and deployment of low-yield nuclear weapons, \nwould continue the ``chilling effect'' on exploration of certain \nadvanced nuclear weapons concepts because few will choose to work on \nthese concepts if their development or production is prohibited. Also, \nthe Department of Defense will not spend precious research dollars on a \nweapon type they have little chance of fielding.\n  I urge support of this amendment. I believe this amendment addresses \nin a serious way the concerns expressed by some of my colleagues. This \namendment would provide all the transparency required to ensure the \nadministration can proceed with research and development of low-yield \nnuclear weapons, but not until Congress has an opportunity to review \nthe request and affirmatively authorize engineering development \nactivities.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from the great State of \nRhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nFeinstein be added as a cosponsor of my amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Warner amendment \nand support of the underlying amendment which I proposed. I will make \nseveral points.\n  First, the notion of low-yield nuclear weapons is something of a \nmisnomer. Indeed, it is misleading. These are nuclear weapons with \nhorrific blasts and radiation effects. As I said yesterday, it is \nprobably more accurate to say not low yield but small Apocalypses \nbecause, when we use nuclear weapons, we go beyond--except for one \noccasion in the history of warfare--what most military people \ncontemplate as the appropriate use of force.\n\n  There is no military requirement for these weapons. Ambassador \nBrooks, the head of NNSA was asked, Is there a requirement? His answer \nsuccinctly and conclusively: No. Yet we are eliminating the ban on the \nresearch, development, production, and testing of these low-yield \nnuclear weapons.\n  Once again, low yield is a misnomer. These weapons are 5 kilotons or \nless. The weapons used against Japan in World War II were 14 to 21 \nkilotons with devastating effects. These small weapons are a third that \nsize--still horrendous weapons.\n  Now, unless we act today, this approach will not simply result in \nresearch. It will result inevitably, inexorably, in the development and \nthe testing and the fielding of these weapons. That is essentially what \nwas said by Ambassador Brooks when he testified before the committee. \nHis words: I have a bias in favor of something that is the minimum \ndestruction. That means I have a bias in favor of that which might be \nusable.\n  This is not just research. This is creating weapons that will be \nused. His comments were echoed with respect particularly to the robust \nnuclear earth penetrator when Fred Celec, Deputy Assistant to the \nSecretary of Defense for Nuclear Matters, is quoted: If we can develop \na system that can crack through the rock and detonate a hydrogen \nweapon, in his words, it will ultimately get fielded.\n  To field an atomic weapon it first must be tested. And we are walking \ndown a path of testing and fielding that I think we will all regret.\n  There is a presumption that arms control does not matter, it does not \nwork. Why did three nations--Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine--turn \nover voluntarily their nuclear weapon and join the nonproliferation \nregime? Why? Because there is an international norm that nuclear \nweapons should not be used. In fact, there should be efforts to \neliminate their existence. These efforts and these norms are being \nundermined by the abolition of this ban.\n  This ban is more powerful than simply saying that the Congress will \napprove it. Why believe a scientist will say: I won't work on research \nunless I can produce and blow something up, an atomic weapon. If those \nare the scientists we have working, then perhaps we should look around \nfor some other scientists. They, more than many other people, \nunderstand the power and the devastating effect of these weapons.\n  If we are really talking about research, let's make it research, not \nthe back door to testing, development, and deployment. My amendment \nmakes it much clearer that is what we are talking about. Indeed, my \ncolleagues came to the floor yesterday and said this has nothing to do \nwith deployment; it is all just science; we have to raise these issues; \nwe have to ask these questions; intellectual curiosity and honesty must \nbe respected in this realm as elsewhere.\n  Indeed, yesterday, Secretary Rumsfeld was asked: Are you pursuing \nnuclear weapons? His response: To pursue? I think it is a study. It is \nnot to develop--his words--it is not to deploy, it is not to use, it is \nto study.\n\n  That is what the Reed amendment says. Essentially it says we will \nallow the scientists who operate in phase 1 through 2A of our well-\ndefined process--research, development--but at the third phrase, that \nis where they stop. And similarly, if they are modifying a weapon \nrather than developing one from scratch, you would stop at phase 6.3. \nIt is clearly defined.\n  The Warner amendment suggests we eliminate all of these prohibitions \nand we simply say: If you are going over here, come back to us and ask \nfor permission. Functionally, in both amendments the Department of \nEnergy and the Department of Defense would have to come to us. But \nthere is a much more powerful, much more forceful, much more effective \nsymbol if this moratorium is retained.\n  A few weeks ago, the Government of Pakistan offered to go nuclear \nfree. They said: We would like to eliminate nuclear weapons on the \nsubcontinent. The Indians would have to agree. That is a very \ninteresting and very positive approach. The problem is, how do we \nreinforce that effort when we are not talking about going nuclear free? \nWe are talking about new nuclear weapons, more sophisticated weapons \nthat can be used. That will not encourage the Pakistanis to give up \nweapons, or the Indians. I think it will encourage their scientists to \nstart looking at more and new technology.\n  We can make a difference if we maintain this ban by allowing what \neveryone says. That is all we want. We just\n\n[[Page S6791]]\n\nwant the opportunity to research. The Reed amendment gives that \nopportunity.\n  I yield the floor and I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WARNER. What is the balance of time remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Virginia has 7 \nminutes and the Senator from Rhode Island has 3 minutes 10 seconds.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I yield the ranking member, the Senator from \nMichigan, 2 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator from Rhode Island for this very \nimportant amendment. The bill before the Senate, unless this amendment \npasses or the Warner amendment passes, removes a 10-year prohibition we \nhave had on research and development of new nuclear weapons that could \nlead to their production.\n  Yesterday, we were assured by speaker after speaker who supports \nremoval of that prohibition that all that is intended is to remove the \nprohibition of research. So the amendment of Senator Reed says, let us \nput that, then, clearly, into this bill; that what will be prohibited \nwill be the development of new nuclear weapons.\n  What is very disturbing and why this amendment is so essential, the \nadministration's position is reflected by the Deputy Assistant to the \nSecretary of Defense for Nuclear Energy, a man named Fred Celec, who \nsays that if a hydrogen bomb can be successfully designed to survive a \ncrash through hard rock, it will get fielded.\n  We have been assured by the opponents of the prohibition that, no, \nthis is just research we are talking about. So the amendment of Senator \nReed puts that clearly into law that what we are now allowing is \nresearch; that the prohibition on development will stay. That is a very \nimportant, clear message to the rest of the world. We are telling North \nKorea we do not want you to go there. We may militarily act to prevent \nyou from going to the development and the production of new nuclear \nweapons. So it is essential that this body send a clear statement that \nwe still have a prohibition on development, although now research would \nbe permitted.\n  I thank, also, Senator Warner. Even though I think the Reed amendment \nis clearly better, and the message stronger that we are not removing \nthe prohibition on development by allowing the research, Senator \nWarner's second-degree amendment is also a constructive addition to \nthis debate and would be surely better than not acting at all.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank both colleagues, the Senator from \nRhode Island and the Senator from Michigan. I pick up on the statement \nof my working partner here for so many years, the distinguished ranking \nmember.\n  What the Senator from Virginia is endeavoring to do today is much \nlike what the Senator from Michigan was endeavoring to do during the \nmarkup.\n  Let us quietly try to assist our colleagues as they formulate their \ndecisions as to what position to take. The Senate spoke yesterday to \nthe effect that we are not going to impose a ban on research. I say to \nthe Senate, that was a wise decision. We should continue with the basic \ntheme that we are not going to impose a ban on this Nation with respect \nto this system or any other system which may be needed for the defense \nof this Nation--hopefully, never in terms of weapons of mass \ndestruction--but we cannot send a message to the world that we are just \ngoing to ignore the fact that they exist in many parts of the world. We \nhave to maintain a credible inventory ourselves as a deterrent against \nothers who might threaten us. So we should not have a ban. But what we \nshould have is in place a law which is clearly understandable.\n\n  Now my colleagues go back and try to revise the existing law which \nhas been in effect since 1994, which I say, with no disrespect to my \ncolleagues. But when it was written--it is very convoluted, it is very \ndifficult to understand because it says: ``LIMITATION--The Security of \nEnergy may not conduct, or provide for the conduct of, research and \ndevelopment''--now they strike those words and put in their own--\n``which could lead to the production by the United States of a low-\nyield nuclear weapon. . . .''\n  Now, I have here a list of the seven steps followed in the life of a \nnuclear system. The first three--the concept study, the feasibility \nstudy, the design definition and cost study--have been authorized by \nthe Senate as of yesterday in this amendment.\n  So we are at this juncture, as my colleague from Rhode Island points \nto his chart, where the balance of these steps toward the full \nimplementation of a nuclear system should be put in control of whom? \nAnd I say it should be put in control of the Congress of the United \nStates, with very clear language.\n  The statute, I say to my friend from Rhode Island, which you are \ntrying to amend simply says, ``The Secretary . . . may not conduct, or \nprovide for the conduct of'' this next step, full-scale engineering \ndevelopment.\n  Theoretically, if you are so distrustful of the executive branch--\nwhether it is this one or a subsequent--they could jump over that--not \neasily but they could jump over and go on to the other steps. So the \nway this thing is written, it is very awkward. It says it only stops \none step.\n  So I say that is a bad way to go about it. I say the better, wiser \nway, as Senator Levin said, is the constructive way, as he pointed out \nin my amendment. It simply says we are not going to point to one step, \nwe are going to point to all the steps and say as follows: ``The \nSecretary of Energy may not commence the engineering development \nphase''--that is the one you are endeavoring to block by amending this \nold statute--but I go on: ``or any subsequent phase, of a low-yield \nnuclear weapon unless specifically authorized by Congress.''\n  That language is as clear as crystal. This language is very awkward \nto interpret and read. It has a flaw in it, that you could literally \njump over the one step that you are blocking and proceed, in some \nmanner, albeit not the best, but proceed to the other steps.\n  My amendment stops it. It is like a stop sign that says: We will not \nproceed as a nation until this body, the Congress of the United States, \nacts to authorize and appropriate the funds.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, this is not an issue of drafting or clarity \nof language. The amendment I propose is very clear. It simply takes the \nexisting ban and walks it back from phase 1, phase 2, and phase 2-A to \nphase 3. If this language was unclear, then the Department of Energy \nand the Department of Defense would have leaped over these barriers a \nlong time ago because they would have ignored the first phase and gone \nto the third, fourth, and fifth phase.\n  This is about whether we are going to begin a new but different \nnuclear arms race. Last week, President Putin announced that Russia is \nbeginning to develop new weapons. His words:\n\n       I can inform you that at present the work to create new \n     types of Russian weapons, weapons of the new generation, \n     including those regarded by specialists as strategic weapons, \n     is in the stage of practical implementation.\n\n  Most analysts interpret that as meaning they are going to develop \nlow-yield nuclear weapons. With those remarks in the Russian Duma, \ninitiating a reversal of history, of the beginning of a new arms race, \nthe Duma applauded. I hope we do not applaud here today.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 2 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, in the spirit of fairness, I am going to \nread, once again, the Warner amendment, which says: ``The Secretary of \nEnergy may not commence the engineering development phase''--that is \nthe phase blocked--``or any subsequent phase, of a low-yield nuclear \nweapon unless specifically authorized by Congress.''\n\n[[Page S6792]]\n\n  Where in the old statute is there any phrase as clear as the one in \nthe Warner amendment which says: Mr. Secretary, you cannot do anything \nuntil you are authorized by the Congress?\n  Mr. REED. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. REED. I do not have the statute before me but the----\n  Mr. WARNER. Let me provide it to you.\n  Mr. REED. Let me tell you this: The original moratorium said: The \nSecretaries of Energy and Defense may not initiate research and \ndevelopment leading to the production of a low-yield nuclear weapon. We \nhave replaced the term ``research and development'' with the \ndevelopment definition ``development engineering'' leading to the \nproduction of a nuclear weapon.\n  Essentially, what we have done, Mr. Chairman, is we have taken the \nexisting ban, which the DOE says restricts their efforts to do any \nmeaningful research, and simply said do the research.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I reclaim my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Virginia does have \nthe floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. You cannot point to any language which speaks to this \nissue with clarity, so it can be understood the world over, as does the \nWarner amendment. It is as simple as that.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. Chairman, with all due respect, if I may have a moment, \nI think the world is pretty clear as to what is taking place. Your \namendment strikes the ban. We used to have a prohibition against low-\nyield nuclear weapons development. Your amendment strikes that. In \nplace, you say you have to come back to Congress.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Senate did that yesterday.\n  Mr. REED. My amendment leaves the ban in place.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired. All \ntime has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to the second-degree amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, how long did that vote take?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty-two minutes.\n  Mr. REID. We have been approached in the minority on several \noccasions today asking when could we finish this bill. We are doing our \nbest. We have people who want to offer amendments. We have wasted at \nleast a half hour this morning on people not being here for votes. I \npersonally believe, for Democrats and Republicans, if they are not here \nat a reasonable time, the vote should be cut off. This is not fair. We \nhave Senator Dorgan who has waited all morning. Senator Collins is \nhere.\n\n[[Page S6793]]\n\n  I am not going to elaborate further, but this is not good for the \nSenate. I hope the majority leader will call these votes more quickly. \nWe get the hue and cry to speed things up. If we waste all time during \nthe votes, there is nothing to speed up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I share the sentiments of my distinguished \ncolleague, but I do observe that the delay on this vote, while it was \nthe last vote on this side, there was a vote on the Democratic side not \nmore than 5 minutes before. We share equally the burdens of the need to \nmove forward on both sides of the aisle.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my most distinguished friend, I said in my \nstatement, this applies to Democrats and Republicans.\n  Mr. WARNER. Right.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the problem we have over here is we cannot \nsay the vote is over. The Senator's side can call the votes. I hope \nthey do it more quickly. If people start missing votes, then fewer \npeople will have to wait around in the future.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I will speak with my distinguished leader \nand ask if he will give me that unfortunate authority to exercise. If \nhe does, I will exercise it appropriately.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senator Dorgan last night said he would \nagree to 45 minutes. We have a unanimous consent request the \ndistinguished manager of the bill will offer. It is my understanding \nthat prior to his starting, there is going to be 5 minutes for the \nSenator from Maine on an amendment that has been agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank our distinguished leader. May I propound the UC \nfirst on the time? Then we will recognize the Senator from Maine for \nnot to exceed 5 minutes. Then the distinguished Senator from North \nDakota can proceed under the time agreement; is that agreeable?\n  Mr. REID. Of course.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be 90 \nminutes equally divided for the debate in relation to the Dorgan low-\nlevel yield amendment prior to a vote in relation to the amendment, and \nthat no amendments be in order to that amendment prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my amendment is not a low-level yield \namendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator is correct. There is a misstatement in the \nwritten text handed to the manager. I apologize. I read it. The Senator \nis correct. It is the other subject. I ask that the UC be amended \naccordingly to the statement by the Senator.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. TALENT. Reserving the right to object, since I understand this \nfollows the Collins amendment and I think the Senator had mentioned 5 \nminutes for that, there are three of us here to speak on the amendment. \nWe want to see if we can get another couple of minutes so we have some \ntime to actually say something. If this UC is dependent on that, I \nraise that issue.\n  Mr. WARNER. I think it is a fair issue to be raised. I was unaware \nthere were additional speakers. If the Senator will give me a moment.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I may interrupt my friend from Virginia, \nhow much time?\n  Mr. WARNER. Ten minutes allocated? I ask the distinguished Senator \nfrom North Dakota. Mr. President, I will make a deal, I will yield 10 \nminutes of my time under this UC request to take that up. How about \nthat?\n  Mr. REID. We accept that.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. TALENT. I thank the chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Maine.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 757\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, on behalf of myself, Senator Talent, \nSenator Hutchison, and Senator Snowe, I send an amendment to the desk \nand ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maine [Ms. Collins], for herself, Mr. \n     Talent, Mrs. Hutchison, and Ms. Snowe, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 757.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the 10 \nminutes we have been allocated be allocated among the three of us as \nfollows: 3 minutes for the Senator from Maine, 3 minutes for the \nSenator from Missouri, 3 minutes for the Senator from Texas, and 1 \nfinal minute for the Senator from Maine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, our amendment addresses an increasing practice in the \nDepartment of Defense to bundle contracts to award a larger contract. \nThe problem with that is it disadvantages smaller companies that cannot \nbid on a giant contract but would be perfectly able to responsibly \nperform the work if the contract were broken up into smaller segments.\n  Contract bundling has become increasingly prevalent in recent years. \nIn fact, it has reached record levels. Contract bundling is up by 19 \npercent since 1992, and the result of this is the shutout of many small \nfirms from doing business with the Federal Government.\n  Our amendment would require that the Department of Defense perform \nrigorous analysis on bundled contracts in excess of $5 million. It \nwould require that alternatives to bundling be considered and that a \ndetermination be made that the benefits of bundling the contracts \nsubstantially exceed the benefits of identified alternatives.\n  We have focused on DOD because the Small Business Administration \nindicates that ``bundling is rooted at the Department of Defense.''\n  The Collins-Talent-Hutchison-Snowe amendment is necessary because \nbundling has had an unfortunate effect on the U.S. Government \ncontractor base. According to the Office of Federal Procurement Policy \nAdministrator Angela Styles:\n\n       This issue is a dramatically reduced contractor base, and \n     the mounting lost opportunity cost of choosing among fewer \n     firms with fewer ideas and innovations to deliver products \n     and services at lower prices.\n\n  She noted:\n\n       The negative effects of contract bundling over the past 10 \n     years cannot be overestimated. . . . Not only are there fewer \n     small businesses receiving Federal contracts, but the Federal \n     Government is suffering from a smaller supplier base . . . \n     when small businesses are excluded from Federal opportunities \n     through contract bundling, our agencies, small businesses, \n     and taxpayers lose.\n\n  That is exactly the case. When contracts are bundled so that only a \nfew large firms can bid on them, the United States does not get as good \na deal. The United States Government is not taking advantage of the \nmany innovative small firms that are capable of doing the work for the \nFederal Government if the contract was awarded in smaller amounts.\n  This is a matter of making sure we have a healthy industrial base, \nthat we have as many firms competing as vigorously as possible to do \nwork for the Federal Government, and of making sure our smaller \ncompanies have a fair shot at competing for Federal contracts. This \namendment will make a real difference for our small businesses.\n  I yield to the Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. TALENT. I yield to the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank Senators Collins, Talent, and \nSnowe for bringing up this subject in the Defense bill. I have small \nbusiness advisory committees in my State and just last week hosted an \nAfrican American leadership summit. The major complaint these small \nbusinesses have is bundling. They would like to have an opportunity to \nbid, but they are frozen out by this process.\n  I vowed I would try to help open the door because it is good for \nsmall business. Small business is the economic engine of America. That \nis where the jobs are created and it will be good for taxpayers, as the \nSenator from Maine has said, to have competition, to have more people \nworking to get into Federal contracting, bringing something different \nto the table. So this is a very important part of our strong national \ndefense, getting the best deal for taxpayers, but it is also very \nimportant that we help our small businesses have access to the biggest \ncontracts that are made in America. Government contracts are the \nbiggest and small businesses have something to offer. Where they are \nproven and where the 8A program has come in to help our minority-owned \nbusinesses get those opportunities, getting the backup they need to be \nreliable minority contractors, that is what we need in this country.\n  We need to open that door. The 8A program does open the door and it \ncreates that level playing field that allows them then the platform to \nget some of the larger contracts.\n  I appreciate the Senators working with all of us to try to bring \nabout this result. I vowed I would do it. I think if we can do it in \nthe Department of Defense, later we can then use that as a model for \nall of the Federal agencies in our country. We will do a better job for \nthe taxpayers and we will help the small businesses of this country \nthat are creating the jobs. We want more jobs in our economy. That is \nthe bottom line. It is a win for everyone.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I too thank the Senator from Maine for her \nadvocacy on this issue, not just this year but in past years. I also \nthank our distinguished chairman and ranking member because I \nunderstand they have cleared this amendment and will accept it.\n  There is not anything more important we can do for small business in \na procurement issue than what we are doing with this amendment. I do \nnot think there is very much more we can do that is important to \ntaxpayers and important to quality in defense procurement than this \nissue.\n  Bundling is choking small business. It is hurting the taxpayer. It is \nhurting quality. This amendment is a major step forward to limiting it \nto cases where it is truly appropriate.\n  From 1992 through 2001, 44.5 percent of DOD procurement dollars were \nin bundled contracts and therefore essentially off limits to small \nbusiness competition. So in each one of those, there were fewer \ncompetitors. There was a tendency to have higher price and poorer \nquality for the taxpayers. And small businesses, which are supposed to \nhave preferences under the statutes, actually were foreclosed from \nbidding.\n  The kind of contract I am talking about is this, and this is an \nengineering contract that was recently let: Indefinite delivery, \nindefinite quantity. This means whoever wins this contract has to be \nable to be prepared to provide any or all of the following in \nindefinite amounts in terms of services at any time the Government \nwants it: Planning, environmental services, inspections, operations, \nmaintenance, family housing services, relocatable facilities and \nstructures, public works supply management, demolition, architecture, \nand engineer and task order management.\n  The Government says, yes, we are very open to small business. You can \nbid on this if you are a small business. You just have to be able to \nprovide all of that at any time we want it in whatever quantity we need \nit.\n\n[[Page S6795]]\n\n  Naturally, small business is cut off. It is hurting the taxpayer. It \nis hurting the small businesspeople. It has a disproportionately \nnegative impact on minority small business. It needs to be stopped.\n  The Senator from Maine quoted Angela Styles from the Office of \nFederal Procurement Policy. It cannot be said better than she said it:\n\n       When small businesses are excluded from Federal \n     opportunities through contract bundling, our agencies, small \n     businesses, and the taxpayers lose.\n\n  That is the short of it. I am glad this amendment is evidently going \nto go into this bill. I hope it stays in in conference. I thank the \nSenator from Maine for her advocacy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank the Senator from Missouri for his hard work. He \nhas been an advocate for attacking this problem for some time and it \nhas been a pleasure to work with him.\n  One woman business owner really summed up what this is all about. She \nsaid, bundling is a shield that keeps large companies from having to \ncompete with smaller firms.\n  Such a state of affairs is ultimately unhealthy for the Federal \nprocurement system. We rely on a vigorous competition to keep prices \nlow and to ensure we are purchasing high quality goods and services. \nThis amendment is going to make a difference in our procurement system \nand a difference for small businesses. For that reason, it has been \nstrongly endorsed by the National Federation of Independent Businesses \nand the National Black Chamber of Commerce.\n  I end my remarks by thanking the distinguished chairman of the \ncommittee and the ranking member for their cooperation and assistance. \nI ask for the adoption of the amendment.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I rise in support of the contract \nbundling amendment offered by Senators Collins, Talent, and Hutchison. \nAs the new Chair of the Committee on Small Business, I am pleased to \njoin with my colleagues to create a policy specifically for the \nDepartment of Defense, DOD, on the issue of contract bundling and to \nplace restrictions on the Department's ability to bundle Government \ncontracts to the detriment of small businesses in this country.\n  In fiscal year 2001, the Federal Government awarded close to $235 \nbillion in Federal contracts. Yet, small businesses still received less \nthan their fair share. As a result, the Federal Government failed to \nachieve the goal that we established for Federal agencies to ensure \nthat at least 23 percent of Federal contracts go to small enterprises. \nEven more troubling is the fact that over the past 10 years, there has \nbeen a steady decline in the number of small business contractors \nreceiving new contract awards.\n  Despite our efforts over the past several years to focus on concrete \nmeasures and legislation to increase small business access to the \nFederal marketplace, we have instead seen a disturbing trend in the \nopposite direction. America's small businesses are being eroded by the \npractice of contract bundling by Federal agencies.\n  In pursuing operational efficiencies, Federal agencies are making \ncontract bundling decisions that block small business access to the \nopportunity to compete for Federal contracts. According to the Small \nBusiness Administration's Office of Advocacy, for every 100 bundled \ncontracts awarded, small businesses lose an average of 60 contracts, \nand for every $100 awarded on a ``bundled'' contract, there is a $33 \ndecrease to small business. At $109 billion in fiscal year 2001, \nbundled contracts cost small business $13 billion.\n  The Small Business Act provides that small firms shall have the \nmaximum practicable opportunity to compete for these valuable Federal \ncontracts. This policy was adopted because it is good for small \nbusiness, good for the purchasing agencies, and good for the taxpayer \nwho pays the bills.\n  Small businesses benefit from having access to a stable revenue \nstream and to a marketplace for new products and services. In turn, \nthese small vendors to the Federal Government contribute to business \ndevelopment, job creation and economic stimulation in our local \ncommunities.\n  Federal agencies also benefit when small businesses participate in \nthe Federal marketplace. Many of the most innovative solutions to our \nproblems--such as new technologies in defense readiness--come from \nsmall firms, not large businesses, where complex chains of command, the \nneed to consult with corporate headquarters, and repetitive sign-offs \non a new idea that have to be cleared with accounting, human resources, \nand marketing, can stifle innovation and creativity. The absence of all \nthese obstacles can increase the agility of a small business to deliver \nnew innovative products at lower costs. Agencies trying to carry out \ntheir governmental functions can take advantage of these innovations \nand deliver better quality products and services to our constituents.\n  Finally, the taxpayer wins when small businesses compete for \ncontracts. Small business means more competition, lower prices and \nhigher quality.\n  Contract bundling, however, threatens these benefits. To simplify the \ncontracting process, agencies take several smaller contracts and roll \nthem into one massive contract. The result is a contract that a small \nbusiness could not perform, due to its complexity or its obligation to \ndo work in widely disparate geographic locations. This practice is \nparticularly prevalent at the Department of Defense, which is the \nFederal Government's largest purchaser of goods and services.\n  In light of this practice, it comes as little surprise when I hear a \nsmall business owner say all too often that ``I could not perform the \ncontract, even if I won it. So I won't even bid.'' When that happens, \nwe all lose.\n  If small businesses create the majority of new jobs in America, which \nthey do, and they account for half the output of the economy, which \nthey do, then, they clearly deserve every possible chance to compete \nfor the business of the nation's largest consumer--the Federal \nGovernment.\n  For these reasons, I called a hearing 2 months ago in the Small \nBusiness Committee to examine the continuing threat of contract \nbundling to small business and to identify positive, constructive \nchanges to ensure that the Federal Government continues to provide \ncontracting opportunities for small businesses.\n  The 1997 Small Business Administration reauthorization legislation \nestablished a definition of bundling and created an administrative \nprocess to review instances of bundling. By its terms, agencies are \nsupposed to make a determination whether a proposed bundle is \n``necessary and justified.'' Yet at the March 2003 hearing, witnesses \ntestified that instead of making a good faith effort to determine the \ncosts and benefits of a proposed bundling, Federal agencies, and \nDefense agencies in particular, have found ways to evade these \n``necessary and justified'' determinations by identifying loopholes in \nthe definition of bundling.\n  As the largest agency in terms of contracting dollars spent, \naccounting for about two-thirds of the Federal Government's total \nspending, it is time to hold the Department of Defense accountable for \nthese bundling determinations--to make sure they include small \nbusinesses in the Federal procurement process, and to make sure they \nfollow the law.\n  The amendment offered today provides a first step in our efforts to \nachieve positive constructive change to ensure the Department of \nDefense continues to provide contracting opportunities for small \nbusiness. It closes loopholes and strengthens the bundling definition \nfor the Department of Defense contract requirements. It also requires \nthe Department of Defense to perform rigorous analysis on bundled \ncontracts; to discuss alternative acquisition strategies; and, to make \na determination that the benefits of bundling ``substantially exceed'' \nthe benefits of the identified alternatives. This marks a higher level \nof scrutiny than exists under current law.\n  I appreciate my colleagues' willingness to work together to establish \nlegislation that counters the effects of contract bundling on small \nbusiness. And, continuing in the spirit of cooperation, I look forward \nto building on this very positive language to address the issue more \nbroadly and make this policy governmentwide as we move forward with \nlegislation to reauthorize the Small Business Administration and its \nprograms later this summer.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I applaud the efforts of Senator Susan \nCollins,\n\n[[Page S6796]]\n\nSenator Jim Talent, and my colleague from the Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship Committee, Senator Carl Levin, for their efforts today \non behalf of small businesses. Their amendment to S. 1050, the \nDepartment of Defense reauthorization bill, is a step in the right \ndirection towards ending the deleterious effect contract bundling is \nhaving on small businesses.\n  Bundled contracts, while seemingly an efficient and cost-saving means \nfor Federal agencies to conduct business, are anticompetitive and \nantismall business. Further, they will result in increased costs over \ntime. When a Federal agency bundles contracts, it limits small \nbusinesses' ability to bid for the new bundled contract, thus limiting \ncompetition and the Government's ability to receive better and cheaper \ngoods and services. Small businesses are consistently touted as more \ninnovative, more flexible and responsive to an agency's needs than \ntheir larger counterparts. But when forced to bid for megacontracts, at \ntimes across large geographic areas, few, if any, small businesses can \nbe expected to compete. This deprives the Federal Government of the \nbenefits of competition and our economy of possible innovations brought \nabout by small businesses.\n  This amendment attempts to close one of the loopholes used by \nagencies to pool like-kind contracts that were previously awarded to \nsmall businesses. The amendment requires the Department of Defense to \nconduct market research, identify alternative contracting approaches, \nand determine if the ``consolidation'' is necessary and justified for \nany ``consolidated contract'' above $5 million.\n  The amendment does not go far enough, however. It only applies to the \nDepartment of Defense, is only applicable for 1 year, and still allows \na loophole that will allow bundling regardless of quantifiable dollar \namounts. I have introduced legislation, S. 633, that would take the \nnecessary steps to further limit the practice of contract bundling. I \nlook forward to obtaining its Senate passage in cooperation with the \nSenators who advocated on behalf of this amendment and all those who \nare determined to remove the barriers to small business development \ncreated by contract bundling.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, our amendment addresses a practice known \nas ``contract bundling,'' which has become increasingly prevalent in \nrecent years. An October 2002 report for the Small Business \nAdministration that measured the trends and impact of bundling over the \nlast decade concluded that: the number and size of bundled contracts \nissued by federal agencies has reached record levels; small businesses \nare receiving disproportionately small shares of the work on bundled \ncontracts; although only 8.6 percent of contracts were bundled, bundled \ncontracts accounted for 44.5 percent of the money spent through \ncontracts from 1992-2001; large firms won 67 percent of all prime \ncontract dollars and 75 percent of bundled contract dollars; and small \nfirms won only 18 percent of prime contract dollars and 13 percent of \nbundled contract dollars.\n  Moreover, the problem is getting worse. In 2001, 29,000 contracts \nwere bundled government-wide, up eight percent from 2000 and 19 percent \nsince 1992.\n  Our amendment would require that DOD perform rigorous analysis on \nbundled contracts in excess of $5 million. It would require that \nalternatives be considered and that a determination be made that the \nbenefits of bundling ``substantially exceed'' the benefits of the \nidentified alternatives. Savings in administrative or personnel costs \nalone would not constitute a sufficient justification for consolidation \n``unless the total amount of the cost savings is found to be \nsubstantial in relation to the total cost of the procurement.''\n  Our amendment focuses on DOD where, the SBA report notes, ``Bundling \nis rooted.'' Although bundling rates occur at levels as high or higher \nat the General Services Administration, Department of Health and Human \nServices, Social Security Administration, and Treasury, ``the high \nlevel of spending by the Army, Navy, Air Force and the Office of the \nDefense Secretary focus attention on defense contracts as the primary \nsource of bundling.''\n  This amendment is about more than just allowing small businesses to \ncompete for contracts on a level playing field; it is about preserving \nour government's contractor base.\n  According to Office of Federal Procurement Policy Administrator \nAngela Styles the issue is a dramatically reduced contractor base, \nwhich has created a lost opportunity cost caused by choosing among \nfewer firms with fewer ideas and innovations to deliver products and \nservices at lower prices.\n  Further, she notes that when small businesses are excluded from \nfederal opportunities through contract bundling everyone, including our \nagencies, small businesses, and the taxpayers lose.\n  Our amendment sets in place a higher level of scrutiny than exists \nunder current law and will be a good start in beginning to reverse a \nproblem that has been building up over the last decade. For that \nreason, small business advocates such as the National Federation of \nIndependent Business and the National Black Chamber of Commerce support \nit.\n  This amendment will make a real difference for small business. One \nsmall business owner wrote to me in support of my amendment because, \nshe said, bundling had made contracts of the size they could hope to \nobtain disappear. She had, she wrote, been knocking on the doors at the \nDepartment of Defense for years, without any success due to bundling.\n  Another small business owner wrote to me that bundling had \nessentially created a monopoly in his line of business. Even small \nbusinesses that have a federal preference in contracting under various \nprograms have seen the beneficial effects of the preferences all but \nwiped out due to bundling. One woman business owner pointed out in a \nletter to me what bundling truly is: a shield that keeps large \ncompanies from having to compete with smaller firms.\n  Such a state of affairs is ultimately unhealthy for a federal \nprocurement system that relies primarily upon vigorous competition to \nkeep prices low and the quality of goods and services high.\n  I am pleased that our amendment has received the support of the \ndistinguished chairman and ranking member, and that it will become part \nof the defense bill the Senate passes today or tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I likewise encourage the adoption of the amendment. I \nthink it is cleared on both sides. I commend the sponsors of this \namendment for their hard work.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired on the amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to proceed for \n1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will indicate our strong support for this \namendment. A few years ago, we actually made an effort to get this \namendment, or something very close to it, adopted. In fact, it was in \nour bill. It went to conference, where we ran into a real roadblock.\n  We are going to give it a go again. In addition to the usual \nsuspects, we have the two Senators from Maine and Missouri who will be \nwith us in conference, and I am very hopeful that this time, with their \nsupport, we will be able to get it over the goal line with the House, \nbecause that is where the impediment was a few years ago.\n  It is an important amendment. I very much support it. In fact, I ask \nunanimous consent that I be listed as a cosponsor to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I note that Senator Kerry has been working very hard in \nthis area. I want to make that clear for the record, because of his \nstrong interest and support for this approach.\n  Again, I very much thank the Senator from Maine and the Senator from \nMissouri for their strong initiative in this area.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time having expired, the question is on \nagreeing to the Collins-Talent amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 757) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to reconsider the vote.\n\n[[Page S6797]]\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Under the order, my understanding is now we go to the \namendment of the Senator from North Dakota, with 90 minutes equally \ndivided.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 750\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. The amendment numbered 750 is at the desk for \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 750.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds for a nuclear earth penetrator \n                                weapon)\n\n       At the end of subtitle B of title XXXI, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 3135. PROHIBITION ON USE OF FUNDS FOR NUCLEAR EARTH \n                   PENETRATOR WEAPON.\n\n       (a) In General.--Effective as of the date of the enactment \n     of this Act, no funds authorized to be appropriated or \n     otherwise made available for the Department of Energy by this \n     Act or any other Act may be obligated or expended for \n     development, testing, or engineering on a nuclear earth \n     penetrator weapon.\n       (b) Prohibition on Use of Fiscal Year 2004 Funds for \n     Feasibility Study.--No funds authorized to be appropriated or \n     otherwise made available for the Department of Energy for \n     fiscal year 2004 by this Act or any other Act may be \n     obligated or expended for a feasibility study on a nuclear \n     earth penetrator weapon.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we are debating the question of whether \nthis country ought to begin developing new nuclear weapons, an \nimportant debate, as about important a debate we will have in this \nSenate in a while. The press gallery is empty because this is not some \nsex scandal. It does not have sensational aspects to it. It is not a \nmurder investigation. It is about whether this country ought to decide \nnow to begin producing additional nuclear weapons.\n  I regret this is not debated and reported as a major national \ninitiative so that the American people can be part of this discussion \nin our democracy. But it is not. I feel very strongly that where we are \nheaded at the moment is in the wrong direction.\n  I told my colleagues before about a fellow from North Dakota I have \nalways kind of enjoyed watching. He is called the flying farmer from \nMakoti. Some have heard me tell about it. The flying farmer from \nMakoti, a guy in a small town of 80 people, Makoti, ND, who drives a \ncar, goes to county fairs and builds himself a ramp and jumps over \ncars, kind of a dare devil. His name is John Smith. He is actually in \nthe Guiness Book of Records because he drove a car in reverse 500 miles \naveraging 36 anywhere. That is the claim to fame of the flying farmer \nfrom Makoti.\n  I think to myself, he has nothing over the Senate, especially on this \nissue. We are fixing to go in reverse a good long ways, with pretty \naggressive speed, on the issue of nuclear policy.\n  We have had in this country an understanding that with respect to \nnuclear weapons, we have them as a deterrent. We do not have them to \nuse; we have them as a deterrent. We now have people walking around \nthis town engaged in policy discussions, talking about ``usable'' \nnuclear weapons. Nuclear weapons? It is just another weapon. In fact, \nlet's talk about not just nuclear weapons, let's talk about low-yield \nnuclear weapons. Programs, they say, are mininuclear weapons or \nmicronuclear weapons, usable nuclear weapons. Let's do designer nuclear \nweapons, they say. Let's now build a new nuclear weapon as a bunker \nbuster nuclear weapon. I have no idea what they are thinking about.\n  In the paper today we have statements in this debate. We have to go \nahead and develop new nuclear weapons because we do not want to tie the \nhands of our military. If we would not allow additional nuclear weapons \nto be developed, we would be the only country in the world that cannot \nproduce new nuclear weapons. What on Earth are we thinking about?\n  Here is the nuclear stockpile for those who cannot sleep at night. \nThere are some apparently who cannot sleep because we do not have \nenough nuclear weapons. I want to give you a sedative. We have roughly \n30,000 nuclear weapons in the world--roughly. No one knows exactly, but \nthese are the best estimates. North Korea, we think, has two or three. \nPakistan has some, India has some, United Kingdom has more than a few, \nIsrael, France, China, the United States, 10,600 nuclear weapons--we \nthink, strategic and theater nuclear weapons--and Russia, 18,600 \nnuclear weapons.\n  Now, I mentioned yesterday that about a year and a half ago following \nSeptember 11 there was a threat. Our intelligence community assessed a \nthreat against this country. The threat was that someone has to have \nstolen a nuclear weapon from the Russian arsenal. Terrorists had stolen \na nuclear weapon from the Russian arsenal and was preparing to detonate \nthat nuclear weapon in this country in either New York or Washington, \nDC. The intelligence threat picked up, deemed perhaps credible, who \nknew, and so for a period of time it did not hit the press. For a \nperiod of time there was a seizure that terrorists might have a nuclear \nweapon, might detonate it in the middle of an American city. And then \nwe are not talking 3,000 deaths, we are talking hundreds of thousands \nof deaths. It was determined a couple of months later that was not a \ncredible threat, and we moved on.\n\n  But interestingly enough, the lesson from it was that it was \nperfectly plausible, to most, that a weapon could have been stolen in \nRussia, and it was plausible that a terrorist having stolen a nuclear \nweapon in Russia could have detonated it, had the capability to \ndetonate it. Perfectly plausible.\n  We have discussed before the command and control of these nuclear \nweapons in Russia. We know they do not have the safeguards we would \nlike. We know there are three-ring binders with hand notations about \ninventories of nuclear weapons; 30,000 of them exist in this world. We \nhad a seizure about one being stolen, one being stolen and everyone is \ngreatly concerned, as they should be.\n  So today we come to the Senate with a bill that says the following: \nWe are not strong enough. We are not secure enough. We are worried \nabout our future. What we need to do is build more nuclear weapons. We \nneed to build low-yield nuclear weapons.\n  What is a low-yield nuclear weapon? That is one-third the size of the \none in Hiroshima. And we need to do bunker buster nuclear weapons, \nearth penetrating bunker buster nuclear weapons. That is my amendment. \nIt strikes the $11 million in this bill, prevents the opportunity to \ncontinue a design, a development, or manufacturer of bunker busting \nnuclear weapons, development testing, engineering, no funds authorized \nfor feasibility study on the nuclear earth penetrator weapon.\n  So the question for the Senate in this amendment is very simple. Do \nyou think you cannot sleep at night because we do not have enough \nnuclear weapons and the only way you will get a good night's rest is if \nyou can build an earth penetrator bunker buster nuclear weapon?\n  Is that what you think? If so, then vote against my amendment. Katy \nbar the door. Let's develop another nuclear weapon. We are saying to \nthe rest of the world with this nonsense, we have the right of \npreemption. We will now renounce the doctrine of first use. We believe \nthere are ``usable'' nuclear weapons, and we need to build low-yield \nnuclear weapons--new ones. We reserve the right to build nuclear \nweapons despite the fact that we have had a moratorium for a decade. We \nbelieve we ought to have a bunker buster nuclear weapon. You know what \nthe message is to India, to Pakistan, and to other countries that want \nnuclear weapons: That this country doesn't think we ought to prevent \nthe spread of nuclear weapons, or that we ought to prevent the use of \nnuclear weapons but that we need to bulk up and build new ones, and \nthat we believe they are potentially usable in some future conflict.\n  That is exactly the wrong message this country ought to be sending to \nanybody in the rest of the world. What we ought to be telling the rest \nof the world is we have 10,600, roughly, nuclear weapons and the means \nto deliver them as a deterrent against anyone who would threaten our \nliberty.\n\n[[Page S6798]]\n\n  We don't need more. To build more is simply a green light to every \nother country in the world that wants to become part of the nuclear \ncommunity.\n  I come from a State that understands defense. I support a strong \ndefense. My votes in the Congress will show that. I support a very \nstrong, robust defense system in this country. We have two air bases in \nthe State of North Dakota. One is for K-135 tankers, and the other has \nboth the Minuteman Missile with Mark 12-A warheads, as well as B-52 \nbombers.\n  Some have said that if the State of North Dakota seceded from the \nUnion, it would be the third most powerful country in the world.\n  I know a little something about this. I have seen a nuclear weapon \nclose up. I have studied what they do and what the impact of nuclear \nweapons are. I have tried to understand deterrent capability.\n  All of us know that with a world full of nuclear weapons we have been \nvery blessed that we have not had a war with nuclear weapons. All of us \nknow that. As I said yesterday, I have kept in my desk for some long \nwhile pieces of material that remind us that the proper approach to \ndealing with this threat is the approach we have used under Nunn-Lugar \nand other arms control and arms reduction treaties. This is a piece of \nmetal taken from the shaft of an S-24 missile that had a warhead aimed \nat the United States. Where that missile was buried in the Soviet Union \nare now sunflowers. There is no missile. The warhead is gone. There are \nsunflowers at the place.\n  How that happened is we paid for the destruction of that missile. We \ndidn't shoot it down. We destroyed it with American taxpayer dollars \nunder arms control agreements.\n  This is copper metal from a ground-up Russian submarine. We didn't \nsink the submarine. We destroyed it under Nunn-Lugar and arms control \nreduction. We paid to have the submarine destroyed.\n  I also have a metal piece in my desk from a wing flap from a Soviet \nbomber. We didn't shoot it down. We paid to have the wing sawed off, \nand that bomber was destroyed with arms reductions and arms control \nmoney from Nunn-Lugar.\n  The fact is we know what succeeds. We know what has reduced tensions \nand reduced delivery systems. Yet we are told today that America will \nonly be safer in this new day and in this new age of terrorism if we \nbegin building new types of nuclear weapons. We are told by people in \npositions of significant responsibility in this town with policy roles \nand responsibility that it is not unthinkable for us to talk about \n``usable'' nuclear weapons. In fact, such discussions have occurred in \nthe pages of our Nation's major newspapers with respect to both \nAfghanistan and Iraq.\n\n  Let me talk for a moment about the so-called bunker buster or earth \npenetrator nuclear weapons. This is about whether we should begin the \nresearch in this new weapon. They are talking about a bunker buster. I \nassume they are talking bunker busters because of Afghanistan. I went \nto Afghanistan. I flew over the mountains where deep in the caves of \nAfghanistan this twisted, sick, demented murderer named Osama bin Laden \nwith his people plotted the murder of innocent Americans. I understand. \nThey have caves there. I understand it was not easy for us to deal with \nthose caves.\n  The result is that we have people saying we need an earth penetrating \nbunker buster nuclear weapon. They are talking the size of a bunker \nbuster up to nearly 70 times larger than Hiroshima. Hiroshima was 15 \nkilotons.\n  It seems to me that if you build a 1-megaton nuclear weapon as a \nbunker buster you are going to bust a whole lot more than a bunker. I \nam guessing you bust a mountain, you bust the territory for miles and \nmiles and miles around, and you bust any living creature. So I don't \nknow. If the bigger the explosion, the safer we are, the more security \nwe have, then be my guest; I guess this would be your weapon. But the \nquestion at this moment in time, at this intersection in America \nhistory is, Is this what we want to do?\n  If today the trucks are moving in North Korea taking spent fuel rods \nfrom the nuclear plant, if today those trucks are moving in a way that \ntakes that material to be produced in a nuclear weapon to be sold to \nterrorists, in a way that has a nuclear weapon showing up 14 months \nfrom now in a major American city, is our first responsibility in the \nCongress and in this country to say what we really need are more \nnuclear weapons? We have 10,600. Is that really our response? Or ought \nwe decide that there are bigger issues and more important issues for us \nto be talking about with North Korea and the rest of the world?\n  Those issues include stopping the spread of nuclear weapons now. I \nmean stopping the spread now. We have so many countries and so many \ngroups that want access to nuclear weapons. Our job is to be the world \nleader. We are the superpower. We have the largest economic engine in \nthe world, and we are the military superpower in the world. We, \nunfortunately or fortunately, have the responsibility and the mantle on \nour shoulders to stop the spread of nuclear weapons. It is on our \nwatch. It is our job. It is not someone else's job.\n  How do we stop the spread of nuclear weapons and decide to send the \nsignal to the rest of the world that nuclear weapons cannot be used in \nthis world of ours? Once you start moving nuclear weapons back and \nforth in anger, this Earth as we know it is gone.\n  Those people who talk about ``survivable'' nuclear weapons are nuts, \njust nuts. They still think about tank wars. You have 200 tanks; we \nhave 100 tanks. Then we have a battle. Who has how many tanks \nremaining? Or if we have 200 and you have 100, that is not the way \nnuclear war will exist on the face of this Earth.\n\n  The only opportunity we have for our children and grandchildren is to \nprevent the use of nuclear weapons--not to talk about the use of \nnuclear weapons, which some are now doing. It is in their minds \npractical to talk about this new day and new age of threat security \nissues, and to talk about the potential of use of nuclear weapons.\n  It is interesting to me that in the middle of all of this \ndiscussion--even in this bill--I mentioned yesterday that we are going \nto have $9 billion in this bill for a national missile defense system \nto intercept an ICBM sent to us by either a rogue state or a terrorist.\n  First, terrorists and rogue states aren't going to get ICBMs. It is \nvery unlikely. Their delivery of choice is going to be in a container \non a tanker ship. It is not going to come in at 18,000 miles an hour. \nIt will come in at 3 miles an hour to a dock in a major American city.\n  The lowest threat on the threat meter in this country we are spending \nthe most money on is national defense, and the highest threat has the \nleast expenditure. Regrettably, that is the appetite for these programs \nin the Senate. But when you talk about threat, the threat, it seems to \nme, is that this country will decide that it makes a U-turn on public \npolicy here with respect to nuclear policy and decide it says to the \nrest of the world, here is a green light. The green light is to build \nadditional nuclear weapons. We want to build so-called low-yield \nnuclear weapons, which is an oxymoron. There is no such thing as a low-\nyield nuclear weapon. We want to build them. Guess what Russia will be \nsaying. We want to build some, too, then. There you go. We want to \nbuild earth penetrator bunker buster nuclear weapons. So will others. \nSo we spark a new arms race. Instead of reducing the number of nuclear \nweapons and making this world a safer place, we will increase the \nnumber of nuclear weapons and will actually have other countries \nunderstanding that it is our country that talks about the potential use \nof nuclear weapons in future conflicts.\n  I think this is the most Byzantine thing I have witnessed in all the \nyears I have served in the Congress. I do not have the foggiest idea \nhow this is not met with the reaction by the American people: What on \nEarth could you be thinking about? Or aren't you thinking at all? I \njust do not understand it.\n  I likely will lose this amendment. It is a small amendment. The \namendment deals with a relatively small amount of money but a \ncritically important principle. I am just trying to take one piece out \nof this bill, the piece that says: Let's start the research to move \ntoward an earth penetrating bunker buster nuclear weapon. Let's just \nstart. Let's just take the first step.\n  I am saying: Let's not.\n  If you cannot sleep at night because we have 10,600 nuclear weapons, \nyou are\n\n[[Page S6799]]\n\nnot going to sleep better at night because you have a bunker buster \nhigh-yield jumbo buster nuclear weapon. That is not going to make you \nsleep better. Take some sleeping pills.\n  Mr. WARNER. Will the Senator yield for a question on my time?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. WARNER. I listened very carefully to your statements. You say \nlet's see if we can't stop taking the first step. Am I correct in that?\n  Mr. DORGAN. That is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. Am I not correct, last year the Congress of the United \nStates spoke to that issue and took that first step and initiated that \nprogram? The first step has been taken.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am sorry, I do not understand your question. Would you \nrephrase the question.\n  Mr. WARNER. Last year the Congress in the military authorization bill \ntook the first step on this program, and put money in the bill. The \nresearch has already commenced.\n  I think the point of reference, to be accurate, I would say to my \ngood friend--you are not taking the first step. In other words, this \nprogram is ongoing. In this bill are simply the funds to continue what \nthe Congress authorized last year after debate and vote.\n  Mr. DORGAN. For purposes of the Senator from Virginia, giving him \ncomfort, let me say my amendment will end the second step. If his point \nis the research for the bunker buster nuclear weapon was last year a \nfirst step, then let me suggest to you my amendment will withhold the \nmoney so we do not take the second step.\n  However, I think the larger point the Senator from Virginia \nunderstands. The step this country wants to take, to say there are \nusable nuclear weapons, that there are designer nuclear weapons that \ncan be produced with lower and higher yields for special kinds of uses \nis a very dangerous step and exactly the wrong step for those of us who \nbelieve our leadership responsibility is both to stop the spread of \nnuclear weapons and to reduce the number of nuclear weapons. I think \nthe larger point the Senator from Virginia understands. But if he is \nmore comfortable with my saying we will stop the second step rather \nthan the first step, we will stop whatever steps are taken in the wrong \ndirection, in my judgment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I just think accuracy on these very important subjects is \nabsolutely vital to establish credibility among our colleagues. I read \nfrom the report language. It says:\n\n       This amount includes $21 million for advanced concepts, of \n     which $15 million is authorized to continue the feasibility \n     study on the robust nuclear earth penetrator.\n\n  So the Senator was incorrect in his representation that he was \nendeavoring as if to say I am going to stop it now before it gets \nstarted. I think that is fair, to let the Congress know, and \nparticularly the Senate, this thing was authorized last year and voted \nupon, approved, funded. This is a second tranche of funds for research.\n  Essentially the amendment of the Senator is to establish a total ban \non this entire program.\n  If I may say on my own time, of course, it is the intention of the \nSenator from Virginia, again in total fairness to our colleagues, to \nincorporate in this legislation, in this bill, a provision which is \nidentical in purpose to the one we just voted on, the Warner amendment. \nIt will say: The Secretary of Energy may not commence the engineering \ndevelopment phase, that's the next phase, or any subsequent phase of \nthe nuclear earth penetrator program unless specifically authorized by \nCongress.\n  So into this legislation--it had been my intent to put it on in the \nsecond degree, but the time agreement understandably precluded that. It \nmay well be other Senators will join us. But this is the intention of \nthe Senator from Virginia. I wish to represent to all colleagues I will \nendeavor, and I have every reason to believe there is going to be \nsupport on the other side, to incorporate this language which will put \nCongress entirely in control of this program, entirely in control, just \nas I amended the previous legislation to put Congress entirely in \ncontrol of every step as it goes along.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If I may use the word credibility, as the Senator from \nVirginia did, let me say to those who might listen to this debate or \nwatch this debate, it is incredible to believe Congress will be in \ncharge of every step of the development of this program. That is \npreposterous. That is not the case on any defense system of which I am \naware.\n  My amendment is very simple, I say to the Senator from Virginia. My \namendment prohibits the use of these funds. You did not talk about \nprohibiting funds. You want to fund it. You want to authorize it. You \nwant to move ahead with it. That is fine. We have a disagreement about \nthat. But there is no credibility issue here.\n  The question is whether this country wants, with this legislation, to \nsay to the rest of the world, By the way, we have embarked on a new \nventure here and with this new venture, whether it is last year or this \nyear, it is decided we need new nuclear weapons including bunker \nbusting nuclear weapons.\n  If the answer to that is yes, that's what we want to do, then the \nanswer is we vote with my colleague from Virginia. If you believe it is \nmoving in exactly the wrong direction, it is driving 500 miles in \nreverse like the flying farmer from Makoti, if you really believe this \nis stepping backward, as I do, and dangerous for the rest of the world, \nyou vote no. You vote to strip the money.\n  Look, money is money, as you know. This $11 million, $15 million is \nprobably not a lot of money to some. But my amendment strips that money \nto say let's stop this. We do not need earth penetrating bunker busting \nnuclear weapons. Does the Senator from Virginia believe at this moment \nwe can't sleep because we don't have bunker busting earth penetrating \nnuclear weapons?\n\n  Mr. WARNER. The distinguished chairman of the subcommittee is here. I \nasked him to address the strategic implications and the necessity. The \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs just yesterday, when I was consulting with \nhim, said there is now a proliferation of effort by nations which have \ninterests antithetical to ours, going deep into the ground to establish \nfacilities to manufacture poison weapons, biological weapons, gas \nweapons, and possibly nuclear weapons. I think it is prudent that our \narsenal of defense deterrence have in it weapons, if I may finish, both \nnuclear and conventional.\n  Mind you, there is an ongoing effort parallel to this one to \ndetermine whether or not we can achieve the same strategic goals of \ndestruction of deep underground facilities with conventional weapons, \nwhich would certainly be used prior to the use of any nuclear weapon. \nSo it is a parallel program of conventional and nuclear.\n  But I respect my colleague whose views are different than mine. His \namendment bans forever this type of weapon--research, development, \neverything. It stops it cold.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am sorry, if the Senator wants to talk about \ncredibility, let me correct the Senator, if you do not mind. On page 2 \nof my amendment it prohibits it for the year 2004, because that's all I \ncan do, with respect to 2004.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DORGAN. And for the year 2004 it says: No funds authorized or \nappropriated or otherwise made available, et cetera, for a feasibility \nstudy.\n  Mr. WARNER. Which study was authorized, I say to my colleague, last \nyear.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me finish my point. If we are going to be completely \naccurate here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will suspend. The Chair will \nadvise the Senator from North Dakota has the floor. All conversations \nare being charged against his time.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I think I said when I took the floor, it \nwould be charged to the Senator from Virginia. It is in the nature of a \ncolloquy which takes place, so statements on my behalf are charged \nagainst my time, statements by the Senator from North Dakota on his \ntime.\n  Mr. DORGAN. That was my understanding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the time will be so \ncharged.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me just make this point because I think it is \nimportant. I, too, want to be accurate. I want to be accurate on my \nside and your side. My amendment prohibits the use of funds\n\n[[Page S6800]]\n\nfor the earth penetrator weapon to be ``obligated or expended for \ndevelopment, testing, or engineering on a nuclear earth penetrator \nweapon.'' That is perpetual. And ``(b) Prohibition on Use of Fiscal \nYear 2004 Funds'' deals only with this fiscal year.\n\n  So to be perfectly accurate, the question of the withholding of funds \nwith respect to the feasibility study only applies to this fiscal year. \nIt is not permanently banning that funding because I can only ban it \nfor this year. So I just want to make that point.\n  I am happy to yield and happy to engage in this colloquy, but I think \nthe issue is quite simple actually: Either one believes we ought to \nhave new nuclear weapons, earth penetrating bunker busters--and I don't \nremember exactly who showed up to testify yesterday; someone from the \nJoint Chiefs, I guess, and they have told us that somewhere around the \nworld, somebody is auguring deep into the earth, God forbid, and we \nmight well need a nuclear weapon to go get them.\n  I would say to people who come around here with those stories: Go get \nsome fresh air. Put some sugar on your cereal. I don't, for the life of \nme--there are people around here, I swear to you, who, if told our \nadversaries were creating a cavalry, would be on the floor trying to \nbuy horses. I don't understand this notion that there is a rumor that \nsomebody is doing something, so let's create a new nuclear weapon.\n  The reason I offer this specific amendment, I say to the Senator from \nVirginia, is that I know they talked about this in Afghanistan, in \nIraq. And they talked about the issue of ``usable'' nuclear weapons. \nThey talked about the difficulty in caves. I have flown over those \nmountains. I have seen those mountains and the caves. But for us to \ncome back here and say: Oh, by the way, our new global strategy is to \ncreate a new class of nuclear weapons--I think that has profound \nimplications with respect to the stability and the spread of nuclear \nweapons around the world.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I readily state you have one position on the concept of \nwhether this Nation should, you said, start up--but I think you agree \nwith me now, it is ongoing--so stop where it is, this program. You make \nyour point. I make my point.\n  What I am trying to do is to clarify, for the benefit of our \ncolleagues, precisely what I understand your amendment does. What this \nSenator, or perhaps joined by others, intends to do is, namely, make \nthe effect of the amendment parallel to what we have done three times \nnow. Three times this body has voted not to ban research on a nuclear \nsystem. You are asking for a ban.\n  I draw your attention to your first sentence: ``Effective as of the \ndate of the enactment of this Act, no funds authorized to be \nappropriated or otherwise made available for the Department of Energy \nby this Act or any other Act may be obligated or expended for \ndevelopment, testing,'' and so forth.\n  Does that not capture the existing funds that were appropriated last \nyear?\n  Mr. DORGAN. No, it does not.\n  First of all, read the last words, ``development, testing, or \nengineering,'' and then compare that to (b) in which I am talking about \nthe feasibility study. I am withholding the funds from the feasibility \nstudy. I was attempting to make that distinction for you.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. But if your amendment would pass, wouldn't it be the \neffect to the Department of Defense: Why waste last year's money if you \nare prohibited from spending another nickel?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am all for that statement: Why waste money? I am all \nfor that. If the proposition is, what I am trying to do is tell the \nDefense Department, don't waste money, then sign me up and count me in.\n  Mr. WARNER. I think we have clarified this situation as best we can. \nBut I wish to state to my colleagues, it is the intention of this \nSenator--I hope to be joined by others; and, indeed, one on the other \nside of the aisle--to put in legislation, as a part of the \nconsideration of this subject of the penetrator, the exact language we \nhad and voted on very strongly here just 15 minutes ago.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I have deep respect for my colleague from Virginia. We \nare friends. We disagree on this issue.\n  Let me make a final point. I know others want to speak on this \nmatter. We are now in a new environment in which the language about the \nnuclear threat has changed dramatically. We have people who say we \nreally need to begin nuclear testing once again. We have people who say \nwe ought not forswear the first use of nuclear weapons; first use might \nin some circumstances be perfectly plausible. We have some who say \nnuclear weapons are ``usable'' as tactical issues, as strategic issues \non the battlefield, they are usable nuclear weapons we ought to be \nconsidering. There are people who say we need new kinds of nuclear \nweapons--bigger ones, the jumbo ones, which is the earth penetrator, \nand smaller ones, the smaller, mininuclear weapons that would be one-\nthird the size of Hiroshima, which certainly is not mini, but that is \nwhat they say.\n  We have people saying all these things in this country, some of them \nin very responsible policy positions. I think the rest of the world \nsees all that, listens to that, looks at bills such as this, and says: \nYou know what, the United States has 10,600 nuclear weapons in its \narsenal. And they say they need more? And they say they have a right to \nuse them? They will not renounce first use.\n  They say they want specific, more designer kinds of weapons for \nbattlefield use.\n  They are saying: You know, the United States has changed. It used to \nbe the United States did everything conceivable in its power to say: \nNever shall a nuclear weapon be used. Our nuclear weapons are \ndeterrents, deterrents so they never can be used against us and never \nused against others. But now it has all changed, and there are people \nwho think it is perfectly plausible, it is just another weapons \nprogram, just part of our weapons system.\n  Well, in 2003, with what is happening around the world--terrorists, \nIndia, Pakistan, North Korea--I cannot think of a more destructive \npiece of public policy than to continue with this kind of nonsense. It \nis not just wrong, it is dangerously wrong, in my judgment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, may I just have 3 minutes from the Senator \nfrom North Dakota?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield the time to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 3 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I support the amendment offered by the \nSenator from North Dakota. I think for the reasons he gives, we should \nnot walk down a road which tells both our people and the rest of the \nworld that we are going to consider the development of what was called \nthe bunker buster, which, as a matter of fact, is from 28 to 70 times \nthe size of the Hiroshima bomb.\n  What we decided last year was we would put a fence around the first \nyear's study and we would get, indeed, a report before that money was \nspent. It is a report which is totally unsatisfactory.\n  So there was a lot of doubt--a lot of doubt--in this body about \nwhether we should proceed down a road which considers the utilization \nof nuclear weapons in new forms that are 28 to 70 times the size of \nHiroshima.\n  Now we are also told, this morning, that now there may be some \nchemical and biological sites that could be underground for which these \nweapons would be used.\n  Well, first of all, conventional weapons are perfectly adequate to \nclose entrances and holes. But putting that aside for a minute, just \nthink about it. The intelligence community said they had identified 590 \nsuspect sites in Iraq--590 sites, according to Secretary Rumsfeld. Now, \nthat used to be a classified number, but apparently the other day it \nwas just declassified by Secretary Rumsfeld, so I will use that number. \nThe intelligence community said 590 sites over there in Iraq are \nsuspect chemical and biological weapons sites.\n  We are going to drop a nuclear weapon on those sites based on the \nintelligence of the CIA? Are we kidding? Do we know what we are dealing \nwith when we are talking about nuclear weapons 28 to 70 times the size \nof Hiroshima? Those are the weapons being considered for modification \nfor the so-called bunker buster. They are not\n\n[[Page S6801]]\n\nbunker busters. These are world peace destroyers. These are city \ndestroyers. These are nation destroyers.\n  For us to casually--and I think it is casual--talk about, ``Let's go \ndown this road, we are not talking about development here, we are only \ntalking about research,'' we have the person who is the top person in \nthe Defense Department as the adviser to the Secretary of Defense on \nnuclear matters, Fred Celec, who says, ``If a hydrogen bomb could be \nsuccessfully designed to survive a crash through hard rock, it will \nultimately get fielded.''\n  Now, that is not one of the supporters of the Dorgan amendment who is \nsaying that. That is the top adviser to the Secretary of Defense who is \nsaying: If we can show that it will work, and design it, it will be \nfielded.\n  The rest of the world does not ignore what we do here. What we are \ndoing here is marching down a road which is dangerous and reckless in \nterms of world peace and security. And we should not do it.\n  This is not just simply a study. This is a step--a very important \nstep--down a road, in a direction which, apparently, according to Fred \nCelec, who is the Deputy Assistant Security of Defense for Nuclear \nMatters, will be ultimately fielded.\n  I support the amendment of the Senator from North Dakota. I do point \nout that there was a fence around last year's money. It was not as \nthough last year we decided to proceed. There were some conditions \nwhich were attached. As far as I am concerned, when you read that \nreport, it is very unsatisfactory, very general, and not at all \nsufficient to justify moving to the next $15 million.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, that fence was met. The Department \nsubmitted its report. On receipt of that report, the program, as \nauthorized last year, commenced. It is an ongoing program.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senator is correct. But it is important to point out \nthat there was so much concern about step 1, there was a fence or a \ncondition attached to the expenditure of the money. It is incumbent \nupon all of us to read the report and ask, does that satisfy us that we \nought to take the next step?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the use of fences is quite common in a \nnumber of areas in the Defense authorization process.\n  Mr. LEVIN. It is, indeed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-seven minutes.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Dorgan \namendment. Before I make any more comments, right at the very start, I \nwant to make one thing clear: We are not building new nuclear weapons. \nWe are modifying existing nuclear weapons. Somehow the other side is \ntrying to imply that we are building new nuclear weapons, and we are \ngoing to continue to add to the number of nuclear warheads we have. We \nare continuing to reduce the number of nuclear warheads under the \nMoscow Treaty.\n  The Senate bill includes an authorization of $15 million to continue \na 3-year feasibility study on the robust nuclear penetrator. I repeat, \nto continue the feasibility study. This is not a new issue for the \nCongress to consider. In the National Defense Authorization Act for \nfiscal year 2003, the Congress authorized $15 million for the first \nyear of the feasibility study on the robust nuclear earth penetrator \nwhich is now under way.\n  This bill authorizes only the continuation of the feasibility study. \nIt does not authorize the production or deployment of such a \ncapability.\n  The RNEP for feasibility--referring to the robust nuclear earth \npenetrator--will determine if one of two existing nuclear weapons can \nbe modified to penetrate into hard rock in order to destroy a deeply \nburied target. That is the challenge we face. Our potential enemies are \ntrying to avoid any vulnerability to targets by going deeper and deeper \nunderground. In order to destroy deeply buried targets that could be \nhiding weapons of mass destruction or command and control assets, this \nnew technology needs to be an option, not that we are necessarily going \nto use it.\n  The Department of Energy has modified nuclear weapons in the past to \nmodernize their safety, security, and reliability aspects. We also \nmodify existing nuclear weapons to meet new military requirements. The \nB-61-11, one of the nuclear weapons being considered for the RNEP \nfeasibility study, was also modified once before to serve as an earth \npenetrator to hold specific targets at risk. At that time, the \nmodification was to ensure the B-61 would penetrate frozen soils. The \nRNEP feasibility study is attempting to determine if the same B-61 or \nanother weapon--for example, the B-83--can be modified to penetrate \nhard rock or reinforced, underground facilities. Authorizing research \non both options, nuclear and conventional--and we hope we will never \nhave to use the nuclear; we hope we can continue to advance the \nconventional technology so that would be the preferred method of choice \nto go after these deep underground hardened targets--for attacking such \ntargets is a responsible step for our country to take\n  Again, we are not producing new nuclear weapons. We are doing a \nmodification. It is a continuing modification. We have modified the B-\n61 before. We are looking at the B-83 to see if perhaps we can't do a \nmodification on that.\n  The sponsor of the amendment made the comment that the United States \nis setting an example for the rest of the world. We are continuing to \nset the example for the rest of the world by reducing the number of \nnuclear warheads. The problem is countries such as Afghanistan and \nPakistan don't care what we are doing. Despite our best efforts to set \nan example, they are continuing to develop nuclear warheads. They are \ndoing more than we are today as far as the triggering mechanism for \nnuclear warheads. If that continues, where will that put us as far as \nthe defense of this country is concerned?\n\n  I commend President Bush. He has taken the lead in reducing the \nnumber of nuclear warheads. It is great that we are able, through these \nkind of programs, to take covert silos, as my friend from North Dakota \nmentioned, and we are planting sunflower seeds. We are still doing that \ntoday as a result of the Moscow Treaty. Even before the treaty, the \nPresident announced that he would take down the Peacekeeper which is \nburied in silos in Wyoming, Nebraska, and Colorado. That effort is \nmoving forward. We are continuing to do that. The point is, we need to \nhave some flexibility. Times are changing. Our targets are changing. We \nneed to have new technology. We need to study. That is what this \nprovides, a feasibility study of these various options. We simply \ncannot afford to be caught shorthanded. Too much is at risk. America is \nat risk.\n  ADM James Ellis, Commander of U.S. Strategic Command, confirmed in \ntestimony before the Strategic Forces Subcommittee, on April 8, 2003, \nthat not all hardened and deeply buried targets can be destroyed by \nconventional weapons. That is his view. Many nations are increasingly \ndeveloping these hardened, deeply buried targets to protect command and \ncommunications and weapons of mass destruction production and storage \nassets. It is prudent to authorize the study of potential capabilities \nto address this growing category of threat.\n  What the Senate bill authorizes is simply the second year of the 3-\nyear feasibility study and nothing more. Should the National Nuclear \nSecurity Administration determine through this study that the robust \nnuclear earth penetrator can meet the requirement to hold a hardened \nand deeply buried target at risk, NNSA still could not proceed to full-\nscale weapons development, production, or deployment without an \nauthorization and appropriation from Congress.\n  We do the study. Say the study says there is a feasible alternative. \nStill they cannot move forward until they have the authorization for \ndevelopment and production through authorization and appropriation from \nthe Congress.\n  We should allow our weapons experts to determine if the robust \nnuclear earth penetrator could destroy hardened and deeply buried \ntargets to assess what would be collateral damage associated with such \na capability. Then Congress would have the information it\n\n[[Page S6802]]\n\nwould need to decide whether development of such a weapon is \nappropriate and necessary to maintain our Nation's security.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing the Dorgan amendment as \nit now stands. This is an important issue. We are talking about the \ndefense of this country. A lot is at stake. I think we need to keep in \nmind that despite the fact we are doing a lot today to reduce the \nnumber of nuclear weapons in our arsenal, other countries are \ncontinuing to test. I put in the Record yesterday a whole page of tests \nthat have occurred since we quit testing underground. Other countries \nare continuing to develop their weapons. We need to continue to use our \ntechnology to make sure we have the proper defenses and the wherewithal \nto protect our troops in the field, to protect America, and to protect \nfreedom.\n\n  Madam President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. MURKOWSKI). Who yields time?\n  Mr. ALLARD. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 750, As Modified\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I have sent a modification to the desk, \na technical modification. I ask to have the modification agreed to.\n  Mr. ALLARD. There is no objection on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is so \nmodified.\n  The amendment (No. 750), as modified, is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds for a nuclear earth penetrator \n                                weapon)\n\n       At the end of subtitle B of title XXXI, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 3135. PROHIBITION ON USE OF FUNDS FOR NUCLEAR EARTH \n                   PENETRATOR WEAPON.\n\n       (a) In General.--Effective as of the date of the enactment \n     of this Act, no funds authorized to be appropriated or \n     otherwise made available for the Department of Energy by this \n     Act may be obligated or expended for development, testing, or \n     engineering on a nuclear earth penetrator weapon.\n       (b) Prohibition on Use of Fiscal Year 2004 Funds for \n     Feasibility Study.--No funds authorized to be appropriated or \n     otherwise made available for the Department of Energy for \n     fiscal year 2004 by this Act may be obligated or expended for \n     a feasibility study on a nuclear earth penetrator weapon.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I urge the Senate to support this \namendment to strike funding for nuclear bunker busters. What sense does \nit make for the Nation to do all it can to prevent the proliferation of \nnuclear weapons, and then start proliferating them ourselves?\n  ``More has changed on proliferation than on any other issue.'' CIA \nDirector George Tenet made this statement not too long ago to the \nSenate Armed Services Committee. He wasn't talking about the United \nStates but he should have been. As we have seen already in this debate, \nthe Bush administration's policy would make the United States the \nbiggest nuclear weapons proliferator of all. They want to \n``nuclearize'' as many of our conventional weapons as possible.\n  But nuclear weapons are different. The unique destructive power of \nthese weapons gives them the capacity to threaten the very survival of \nhumanity. That is why nuclear weapons have always been kept separate \nfrom other weapons as part of our strong commitment to do all we can to \nsee that they are never used again. Only in the most dire circumstances \nshould the use of nuclear weapons be considered--only if the very \nsurvival of our Nation is threatened.\n  It makes no sense to break down the firewall we have always \nmaintained between nuclear weapons and other weapons. This policy has \nworked for over half a century in preventing nuclear war. Other nations \nhave complied with the basic principle, too. A nuclear weapon is not \njust another item in our Nation's arsenal. We don't need to start \nbuilding mini-nukes when our state-of-the-art, high-tech conventional \nweapons can do the same job. And we don't need to go nuclear with our \nconventional bunker buster weapons, either.\n  I was 13 years old on that fateful day in August 1945, when a B-29 \nbomber flying high over Hiroshima dropped the first nuclear weapon, \n``Little Boy.'' More than 4 square miles of the city were instantly and \ncompletely devastated. Over 90,000 people died instantly. Another \n50,000 died by the end of that year. Three days later, another B-29 \ndropped ``Fat Man'' over Nagasaki, killing 39,000 people instantly and \ninjuring 25,000 more.\n  Since then, no nuclear weapon has ever been used in any war. There \nhave been close calls in the past half century but this weapon was \nnever used. In 1948, the Soviet Union began the Berlin Blockade, and we \nconsidered the use of tactical nuclear weapons if the conflict \nescalated. We also considered the use of nuclear weapons in the Korean \nwar. In 1957, the Soviets launched Sputink, and it became clear that \ntwo oceans could not protect us from a nuclear attack at home.\n  In 1958, President Eisenhower declared a moratorium on all nuclear \ntesting--with the understanding that the Soviet Union would also honor \nthe moratorium. But testing resumed in 1961, and after negotiations \nwith the Soviet Union, we issued a Joint Statement of Agreed Principles \nfor Disarmament Negotiations--the so-called McCloy-Zorin accords--which \noutlines a program for general and complete disarmament.\n  In the work of the Cuban missile crisis, President Kennedy pushed \nforcefully for a treaty to limit the development of nuclear weapons. \nThe result was in the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in August 1963, \nprohibiting tests of nuclear weapons in the atmosphere.\n  In February 1967, a treaty prohibited nuclear weapons in Latin \nAmerica.\n  In July 1968, the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons \nwas signed in Moscow, London, and Washington, and entered into full \nforce in March 1970. That same year brought the beginning of the first \nround of Strategic Arms Limitation Talks in Vienna. The SALT agreement \nwas signed 2 years later in 1972 and placed restrictions on the number \nand size of nuclear warheads in the Soviet and American arsenals.\n  In the 1970s, we made further progress in limiting the threat of \nnuclear war. The Senate approved treaties to prohibit the placement of \nnuclear weapons in the ocean and to limit underground testing. We \nalmost reached an agreement on the second round of Strategic Arms \nLimitation Talks, or SALT II, but the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in \n1970 took that agreement off the table.\n  In 1987, the Soviet Union and the United States signed the \nIntermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. In 1991, using pens made from \nmelted down missiles, President Bush and President Gorbachev signed the \nStrategic Arms Reduction Treaty START I.\n  Six months later both nations committed to further nuclear program \nreductions and eliminations. Soviet leader Gorbachev initiated a \nmoratorium on nuclear testing in October 1991, and President Bush \ncanceled the Midgetman Missile Program and stopped production of \nadvanced cruise missiles in January 1992. That summer, the Senate voted \nfor a 9-month moratorium on nuclear weapons testing beginning in \nOctober 1992, with a final cutoff of all testing by September 1996.\n  In 1993, Presidents Bush and Yeltsin signed START II, reducing U.S. \nand Soviet arsenals of longer range nuclear weapons and eliminating all \nland-based missiles with multiple warheads over the next 10 years.\n  After we finalized this testing moratorium, France and China stopped \ntesting, and Russia continued its own moratorium. But now, after many \ndifficult years of this progress toward preventing nuclear war, the \nBush administration wants to change direction and go the other way. \nLast year, it requested $15.5 million to study the feasibility of \nadding a nuclear bunker buster to our arsenal. They say they need it to \ndestroy hardened and deeply buried targets, and they want $15 million \nmore this year to continue the project.\n  They say they need it to destroy hardened targets buried deeply \nunderground, but the scientific community has raised serious questions \nabout the effectiveness and need for these weapons. A nuclear explosion \nin a bunker could spew tons of radioactive waste into the atmosphere. \nObviously, trying\n\n[[Page S6803]]\n\nto develop nuclear weapons for this mission distracts from developing \nconventional alternatives to do the job.\n  According to Dr. Sidney Drell, of Stanford University: Currently, we \ndon't have the capability of digging down more than 50 feet to reach \ndeeply buried hardened targets. If we detonate just 1 kiloton between \n20 and 50 feet down, a million cubic feet of dirt would have \nradioactive contamination, and a crater the size of the crater at the \nWorld Trade Center would be created.\n  Imagine what would happen if one of these weapons was a nuclear \nweapon with a yield of 400 kilotons and was detonated. Is it even \npossible to imagine a crater 400 time the size?\n  It makes no sense to start down this road. No country should be \nmaking weapons like that. It is wrong for this administration to start \ndeveloping new types of nuclear weapons that have no plausible military \npurpose and that can only encourage even more nations to go nuclear.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I am very concerned that the fiscal year \n2004 Defense Authorization Act provide $15 million of funding for the \ncontinued study into the feasibility of developing a robust nuclear \nearth penetrator.\n  The robust nuclear earth penetrator is a bomb designed to bury itself \ndeep into the ground before it explodes. This is not a low-yield \nnuclear weapon. According to reports, this weapon would be five times \nmore powerful than the device detonated at Hiroshima--and would have an \neven greater impact because a nuclear weapon's force is multiplied when \nits shock wave penetrates the crust of the Earth.\n  The aim of those who support this research into the robust nuclear \nearth penetrator believe that a usable nuclear weapon will be able to \ndestroy deeply buried targets with few casualties and little fallout. \nUnfortunately, science is not on their side.\n  Last year, a number of scientists, including Sidney Drell of the \nStanford Linear Accelerator Center wrote, ``an earth-penetrating \nwarhead with a yield sufficient to destroy a buried target cannot \npenetrate deeply enough to fully contain the nuclear explosion; it \nwould necessarily produce an intense and deadly radioactive fallout. \nThus, it is not technically possible to use nuclear weapons to destroy \ndeeply buried targets without at the same time causing significant \nradioactive contamination and collateral damage if used in an urban \narea.''\n  Another argument pushed by those in favor of these nuclear weapons is \nthat they would be useful in destroying stockpiles of biological and \nchemical weapons.\n  While a nuclear weapon could, in fact, incinerate biological and \nchemical weapons if the nuclear blast is nearby, it is unlikely that we \nwill ever have perfect intelligence about the location of these \nweapons. Our continued inability to find weapons of mass destruction in \nIraq is a perfect illustration.\n  In addition, the Union of Concerned Scientists points out that the \nrobust nuclear earth penetrator could actually disperse biological and \nchemical weapons by spreading them into the resulting crater and \nsurrounding air. These weapons are not usable weapons.\n  Finally, our continued development of new uses for nuclear weapons \nwill only spurn other nations to do the same.\n  As Rose Gottemoeller, the former Deputy Secretary of Energy, has \nsaid, ``I think people abroad will interpret this as part of a really \nenthusiastic effort by the Bush administration to renuclearize. And I \nthink definitely there's going to be an impetus to the development of \nnuclear weapons around the world.''\n  The war in Iraq showed our Nation has overwhelming superiority when \nit comes to conventional forces. It doesn't make any sense to promote \nthe development of nuclear weapons and signal to the world that weapons \nof mass destruction have other uses other than a means of last resort.\n  I urge the passage of the Dorgan amendment.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that we vote at \n12:30 relative to the Dorgan amendment; that our time be equally \ndivided between both sides; and that after the vote, Senator Byrd be \nallowed to speak for 20 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Is this a UC request?\n  Mr. ALLARD. It is my understanding Senator Reid discussed this with \nthe chairman and it was agreed that Senator Byrd would have an \nopportunity to speak for 20 minutes after the vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. That's correct. If I may add a word or two to this. In \nthe course of my colloquy with the Senator from North Dakota, it was \nindicated there would be an effort to place in this bill language \ncomparable to what was in the amendment that was voted on immediately \nprior to this one to give a consistency in the manner in which we are \ntreating these very serious questions. So I will put this on the desk \nand I will represent to our colleagues that this language will be \nforthcoming and a part of this bill.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, that doesn't mean we are \ngoing to have two votes, or does it?\n  Mr. WARNER. I have indicated to the ranking member that this \nlanguage, I think, could be voice-voted because I think there is \nconsensus on both sides in an effort to make parallel and to put the \nCongress clearly into play.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, it is also my understanding that Senator \nLautenberg would be willing to offer an amendment following the \nstatement of the Senator from West Virginia. He also indicated he would \nagree to a time limit.\n  Mr. WARNER. We are prepared to enter into that now.\n  Mr. REID. I haven't had a chance to talk about the time with him. I \njust wanted to alert people of that. Shortly after Senator Lautenberg \noffers his amendment, there would be a vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. It is my hope that in the course of Senator Byrd's 20 \nminutes, if that decision could be made, Senator Byrd would certainly \nunderstand the need to maintain the momentum.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Madam President, I renew my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, let me conclude with a few comments and \nindicate, as I should have, that Senator Feinstein of California, \nSenator Byrd, and Senator Bingaman are all cosponsors of my amendment. \nLet me conclude by saying I understand there is a difference of opinion \nabout what defending America really is. I don't think it is defending \nour interests or providing greater national security to be involved in \nthe creation of new nuclear weapons.\n  I believe the best way to defend our country, especially in a new day \nand age of terrorism, is to understand we must find ways to prevent \nterrorists from ever acquiring nuclear weapons, for they surely will \nuse them. We saw what they did with a low-tech weapon, with jet \nairplanes full of fuel. That was a low-tech weapon.\n  The ability to acquire nuclear weapons will be a devastating \nconsequence, especially for us in the United States, because terrorists \nwill surely want to use them. It seems to me our job is to stop the \nspread of nuclear weapons, do everything conceivably possible to stop \nthe spread of nuclear weapons and provide no green lights, no go signs \nfor anybody in the world to believe that we think it is acceptable for \nthe use of nuclear weapons; that we believe nuclear weapons are \n``usable'' in battlefield circumstances; that we believe we ought to \nbuild additional nuclear weapons, understanding that others will as \nwell. If we want to do low yield, they will also want to. If we want to \ndo penetrating bunker busters, they will want to do them.\n  Our job, it seems to me, is to say the only success we will be able \nto claim in the future is that we prevented the spread of nuclear \nweapons and prevented their use and, over a long period of time, began \nto reduce the number of nuclear weapons.\n  Thirty thousand nuclear weapons exist on this earth. The detonation \nof one will represent the greatest calamity, or potentially represent \nthe greatest calamity in the history of the world. The detonation of \none relatively small nuclear weapon in the middle of a major American \ncity could likely cause hundreds of thousands of deaths.\n  This is a big issue. This is very important. I think people walking \naround this town talking about usable nuclear weapons, beginning to \ntest nuclear weapons once again, building new designer nuclear weapons, \nis a terrible mistake. It is sending a signal to the\n\n[[Page S6804]]\n\nrest of the world that nuclear weapons are like other weapons. They are \nnot. They are not like other weapons. The only value of a nuclear \nweapon for us has been as a deterrent to prevent others from using \nthem.\n  We must, it seems to me, from this day forward, with the world \npopulated by 30,000 nuclear weapons, find a way to keep them out of the \nhands of the wrong people, to stop the proliferation, and to begin to \nreduce their number. That ultimately represents our security. That is \nthe way to defend this country: to stop the spread of nuclear weapons, \nnot to build more.\n  I suspect we will see on this amendment, as we have on the previous \namendments, that I will come up short on the vote. I regret that very \nmuch. I so strongly believe this country is sending a terrible signal \nto the rest of the world--Russia, China, Pakistan, India, you name it. \nI think this is a dreadful mistake. It does not strengthen this \ncountry. In my judgment, it makes this country more vulnerable in the \nlong term.\n  Let me finish as I started. I have been the strongest supporter of \nthis country's system of defense. I voted for the Defense bills. I \nworked on weapons systems. I think this country needs a robust, strong \ndefense. I have always felt that way. I come from a State with two \nmilitary airbases and the best Air National Guard in the country. I \nunderstand B-52s, KC-135 tankers, and Minuteman missiles.\n  I support a strong, robust defense. Nuclear weapons are different. \nThey are different. They threaten the very existence of the world as we \nknow it, and that is why it must be dealt with differently. That is why \nI offer this amendment.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I move to table the Dorgan amendment and \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That motion is not in order while time remains \nfor debate.\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield back the time on our side. It is my understanding \nthey will be yielding back time on their side.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. WARNER. All time having been yielded back, I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to table the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion. The \nclerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nEdwards), the Senator from Florida (Mr. Graham), and the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would vote ``nay''.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 56, nays 41, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 189 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--56\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham (SC)\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--41\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--3\n\n     Edwards\n     Graham (FL)\n     Kerry\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, we will consult with the proponent of \nthe underlying amendment. But for the moment, the Senate has tabled \nthis matter.\n  It is my hope we could proceed to the Nelson amendments. I thank our \ndistinguished colleague from Florida for his cooperation. We can do \nboth by voice vote, it is my hope.\n  On the one amendment, I would like to be associated with you because \nI represented throughout the vote, to my side, that the language be \nincorporated. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At this time there is a previous order to \nrecognize the Senator from West Virginia.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, we have spoken to the Senator from West \nVirginia. He has no objection to the two managers of the bill disposing \nof the two Nelson amendments.\n  If I could just be heard briefly? We have several people on our side \nwho want to offer amendments. I hope those people who want to offer \namendments would contact the two managers of the bill. We are running \nout of names of people to offer amendments. Both leaders have indicated \nthey want to complete this bill as quickly as possible. We are not \ngoing to be able to work late into the night tonight.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, if I could bring some new information on \nthat subject? The majority leader had a conversation with me just a \nminute ago. I have not had a chance to share it.\n  I intend to stay here, as will other Members on my side, tonight. The \nmajority leader is open to having votes, if necessary, at about 9:30 \ntonight.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, this is an excuse so he doesn't have to go \nto this dinner.\n  Mr. WARNER. As we say in the law, I plead nolo contendere.\n  Mr. LEVIN. What dinner would we also be missing?\n  Mr. REID. We are not invited.\n  Mr. LEVIN. We are not invited.\n  Mr. REID. I would say then there is a possibility we could complete \nthis legislation tonight.\n  Mr. WARNER. If we get the cooperation and Senators call--we are right \nhere on the floor--and indicate that you desire to have an amendment, \nwe will see if we can accept it. If we cannot, we will proceed to put \nit in line.\n  I say to the leadership that we are going to hear from the \ndistinguished senior Senator from West Virginia. Following that, I know \nof one amendment on this side by Senator Hutchison, the Senator from \nTexas. And we have the amendment by the Senator from New Jersey.\n  Is that my understanding?\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. Could we put those in order now, but maybe not lock them \nin?\n  Mr. REID. That would be good, if Senator Hutchison could go first \nbefore Senator Lautenberg.\n  Mr. WARNER. I think I can make those arrangements.\n  Mr. REID. How long will she take?\n  Mr. WARNER. Fifteen minutes, or less. We may be able to accept it \nwithout requiring a vote.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Lautenberg would be 1:45, and he will take one-half \nhour. He probably will not use the whole one-half hour. I would be \nhappy to ask unanimous consent that Senator Hutchison from Texas be \nallowed to offer her amendment, followed by the Senator from New \nJersey.\n  Mr. WARNER. I am agreeable to that unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HARKIN. If the Senator will yield, I have an amendment on which I \nwill not take much time, if I could just have 15 minutes. I do not know \nif it will be accepted or not. I ask for 15 minutes.\n\n[[Page S6805]]\n\n  Mr. WARNER. How soon would the Senator be willing to share the text \nof the amendment with the managers?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Right now.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator be able to go immediately after the \ndisposition of the Lautenberg amendment, which would be about 2 \no'clock, or 1:30 or 2?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes. Around 1:30. Yes, I can do that.\n  Mr. LEVIN. It may be later than 2.\n  Mr. REID. He is not going to start until quarter to 2.\n  Mr. LEVIN. It would be about 2:30 or quarter to 3. Would the Senator \nfrom Iowa be able to do it in that time period?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will make time to do it.\n  Mr. WARNER. We thank the Senator from Iowa for that cooperation \nbecause, frankly, we don't know of many more amendments. We are nearing \nthe end.\n  Mr. REID. Following Senator Lautenberg, could I modify my request for \nhim to be next in order?\n  Mr. WARNER. There is no objection on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. I appreciate the patience of the Senator from Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I thank the two leaders of \nour committee who have been so accommodating and so gracious to work \nthis out.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 766\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I send an amendment to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. Nelson], for himself and Mr. \n     Warner, and Mr. Levin, proposes an amendment numbered 766.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To require a specific authorization of Congress for the \n commencement of the engineering development phase or subsequent phase \n                 of a Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator)\n\n       At the end of subtitle B of title XXXI, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 3135. REQUIREMENT FOR SPECIFIC AUTHORIZATION OF CONGRESS \n                   FOR COMMENCEMENT OF ENGINEERING DEVELOPMENT \n                   PHASE OR SUBSEQUENT PHASE OF ROBUST NUCLEAR \n                   EARTH PENETRATOR.\n\n       The Secretary of Energy may not commence the engineering \n     development phase (phase 6.3) of the nuclear weapons \n     development process, or any subsequent phase, of a Robust \n     Nuclear Earth Penetrator weapon unless specifically \n     authorized by Congress.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, this amendment brings \nsymmetry to the bill by our action earlier this morning. Senator Warner \nhad an amendment agreed to which said the Congress should authorize the \nproduction of a low-yield nuclear weapon. In other words, the Congress \nwas going to have to step in if we were going to make a major step in \nthe production of a new nuclear weapon from our present policy of years \nstanding and of not producing any new kinds of nuclear weapons. That \nwas agreed to earlier with regard to a low-yield nuclear weapon under \nthe philosophy recognizing that the United States is trying to keep \nproliferation of nuclear weapons down, and that once you start letting \nthat nuclear genie out of the bottle, it is very hard to reverse. That \nwas the theory upon which the earlier amendment was agreed to.\n  So, too, the amendment I sent to the desk, cosponsored by the two \nleaders of our committee, will require the Congress to authorize any \nproduction of a robust nuclear earth penetrator. A nuclear weapon would \nhave to be modified to go into this new robust earth penetrator. That \nis a decision reserved to the Congress and its authorization for such a \nweapon to go from the research stage to the production stage.\n  I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I join in this amendment. It had been my \nintention to add the second-degree amendment to the amendment we just \nvoted on. I so indicated to my colleagues on this side, recognizing I \nthink it is a benefit for the amendment to originate by our \ndistinguished colleague and member of the committee from Florida on \nthis side of the aisle. This makes ``parallel'' almost to the exact \nword treatment of both of these initiatives with regard to nuclear \nweapons in the current 2004 authorization bill.\n  I commend the Senator. I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I very much support this effort on the \npart of the Senator from Florida. It is a very precise, \nstraightforward, and short amendment. The language has great meaning. \nThe Secretary of Energy is not allowed, under this language, to \ncommence the engineering development phase of a robust nuclear earth \npenetrator without specific authority of the Congress. Each word has \nmeaning. There are not a lot of words in this amendment. It is one of \nthe shortest amendments we have seen around here. But every single word \nin that amendment has meaning.\n  I thank not just my good friend from Florida but also the Senator \nfrom Virginia because they have really made a constructive contribution \nto this entire debate by supporting this approach. It is not as strong \nas some of us would have liked, but it nonetheless is very clear and \nvery specific and says you may not proceed to engineering development \nunless Congress specifically authorizes that action. It is a \nsignificant improvement of the bill.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, the modesty of my distinguished \ncolleague sometimes is overwhelming. The concept of this language which \nhe described and written in the King's English originated with him in \nthe course of the markup of our bill. I then plagiarized it for the \npurpose of earlier legislation. I don't know whether the Senator from \nFlorida has plagiarized it. But we owe him a great debt. I am so glad \nwe had the early discussion today about the clarity of certain statutes \nand that the Senator recognized this one speaks with great clarity. \nThat is why it prevailed on our side.\n  I urge its adoption.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator for his generosity. His mind works \nextremely clearly and extremely quickly. However, the good Senator from \nFlorida deserves much of the credit because he has been taking the lead \nin a whole lot of these areas. I thank both of them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). Is there further debate? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 766) was agreed.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 767\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. Nelson], for himself and Mr. \n     Warner, and Mr. Levin, proposes an amendment numbered 767.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To require a study on the application of technology from the \nRobust Nuclear Earth Penetrator Program to conventional hard and deeply \n              buried target weapons development programs)\n\n       At the appropriate place in Title XXXI in the bill add the \n     following new section:\n\n     SEC.--\n\n       (a) Findings.--Much of the work that will be carried out by \n     the Secretary of Energy in the feasibility study for the \n     Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator will have applicability to a \n     nuclear or a conventional earth penetrator, but the \n     Department of Energy does not have responsibility for \n     development of conventional earth penetrator or other \n     conventional programs for hard and deeply buried targets.\n       (b) Plan.--The Secretary of Energy and the Secretary of \n     Defense shall develop, submit to Congress three months after \n     the date of enactment of this act, and implement, a\n\n[[Page S6806]]\n\n     plan to coordinate the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator \n     feasibility study at the Department of Energy with the \n     ongoing conventional hard and deeply buried weapons \n     development programs at the Department of Defense. This plan \n     shall ensure that over the course of the feasibility study \n     for the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator the ongoing results \n     of the work of the DOE, with application to the DOD programs, \n     is shared with and integrated into the DOD programs.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, basically we have in the \nauthorization bill the ability to conduct this study that has been \nongoing for the last year and a half about the robust nuclear earth \npenetrator. There is a certain sum of money in the underlying bill that \nallows the conduct of that study to continue.\n  What we raised in the committee was the fact that a robust earth \npenetrator may well be in the interest of the United States, that it \ncontain a conventional weapon as opposed to a nuclear weapon. So the \nattempt of this amendment is to clarify that the research that will be \nconducted by the Department of Energy, with regard to the modification \nof a nuclear weapon that would go in the earth penetrator, that the \nresearch will be coordinated with the Department of Defense in their \nconduct and research of an earth penetrator that includes a \nconventional weapon.\n  I urge adoption of the amendment, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to endorse the amendment because it \nhas a very sound predicate, a very sound philosophy; namely, that we \nshould do everything possible to channel all of our scientific efforts \ntoward not using a nuclear weapon, and this does just that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I very much support the amendment for the \nreasons given by the Senator from Virginia. I commend our good friend \nfrom Florida for his initiative.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there any further debate?\n  There being none, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 767) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we thank our colleague from West Virginia. \nHe has shown us the usual senatorial courtesy to allow the managers to \nmove timely amendments.\n  The distinguished Senator from West Virginia is recognized now for a \nperiod of 20 minutes. I thank him very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the two managers of the bill, Mr. \nWarner and Mr. Levin, for the very professional, highly dignified \nmanner in which they have conducted their work on this bill. I thank \nthem for the many hours they spend in the committee, which they so ably \nchair and act within as ranking member.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, could I just say, I appreciate the \nexpression of those remarks by our senior colleague. Senator Levin and \nI are in our 25th year--that is a quarter of a century--in the Senate. \nThroughout that period of time, the Senator from West Virginia has been \na tutor, and we have learned much. To the extent we may have progressed \nin our learnings, it is owing in part to his teachings. I thank the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am deeply grateful for those unmerited and \nhighly charitable remarks from the distinguished Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I hate to interrupt our dear friend and \nmentor from West Virginia but I must do so just to tell him that those \nremarks of our dear friend from Virginia were merited, indeed.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nMichigan.\n\n\n                                  Iraq\n\n  Mr. President:\n\n       Truth, crushed to earth, shall rise again,\n       The eternal years of God are hers;\n       But Error, wounded, writhes in pain,\n       And dies among his worshippers.''\n\n  Truth has a way of asserting itself despite all attempts to obscure \nit. Distortion only serves to derail it for a time. No matter to what \nlengths we humans may go to obfuscate facts or delude our fellows, \ntruth has a way of squeezing out through the cracks, eventually.\n  But the danger is that at some point it may no longer matter. The \ndanger is that damage is done before the truth is widely recognized and \nrealized. The reality is that, sometimes, it is easier to ignore \nuncomfortable facts and go along with whatever distortion is currently \nin vogue. We see a lot of this today in politics. I see a lot of it-- \nmore than I ever would have believed--right on this Senate floor.\n  Regarding the situation in Iraq, it appears to this Senator that the \nAmerican people may have been lured into accepting the unprovoked \ninvasion of a sovereign nation, in violation of long-standing \ninternational law, under false premises.\n  There is ample evidence that the horrific events of September 11 have \nbeen carefully manipulated to switch public focus from Osama bin Laden \nand al-Qaida who masterminded the September 11 attacks, to Saddam \nHussein who did not. The run up to our invasion of Iraq featured the \nPresident and members of his Cabinet invoking every frightening image \nthat they could conjure, from mushroom clouds, to buried caches of germ \nwarfare, to drones poised to deliver germ laden death in our major \ncities. We were treated to a heavy dose of overstatement concerning \nSaddam Hussein's direct threat to our freedoms. The tactic was \nguaranteed to provoke a sure reaction from a nation still suffering \nfrom a combination of post traumatic stress and justifiable anger after \nthe attacks of 9/11. It was the exploitation of fear. It was a placebo \nfor the anger.\n  Since the war's end, every subsequent revelation which has seemed to \nrefute the previous dire claims of the Bush administration has been \nbrushed aside. Instead of addressing the contradictory evidence, the \nWhite House deftly changes the subject. No weapons of mass destruction \nhave yet turned up, but we are told that they will in time. And perhaps \nthey yet will. But, our costly and destructive bunker busting attack on \nIraq seems to have proven, in the main, precisely the opposite of what \nwe were told was the urgent reason to go in. It seems also to have, for \nthe present, verified the assertions of Hans Blix and the inspection \nteam that he led, which President Bush and company so derided. As Blix \nalways said, a lot of time will be needed to find such weapons, if they \ndo, indeed, exist. Meanwhile bin Laden is still on the loose out there \nsomewhere and Saddam Hussein has come up missing.\n  The administration assured the U.S. public and the world, over and \nover and over again, that an attack was necessary to protect our people \nand the world from terrorism. It assiduously worked to alarm the public \nand to blur the faces of Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden until they \nvirtually became one.\n  What has become painfully clear in the aftermath of war is that Iraq \nwas no immediate threat to the United States, and many of us here said \nso before the war. Ravaged by years of sanctions, Iraq did not even \nlift an airplane against us. Saddam Hussein could not even get an \nairplane off the ground. Iraq's threatening death-dealing fleet of \nunmanned drones about which we heard so much morphed into one prototype \nmade of plywood and string. Their missiles proved to be outdated and of \nlimited range. Their army was quickly overwhelmed by our technology and \nour well trained troops.\n  Presently our loyal military personnel continue their mission of \ndiligently searching for weapons of mass destruction. They have so far \nturned up only fertilizer, vacuum cleaners, conventional weapons, and \nthe occasional buried swimming pool. They are misused on such a mission \nand they continue to be at grave risk. I am talking about the sons and \ndaughters of the American people. The Bush team's extensive hype of WMD \nin Iraq as justification for a preemptive invasion has become more than \nembarrassing. It has raised serious questions about prevarication and \nthe reckless use of power. Were our troops needlessly put at risk? Were \ncountless Iraqi civilians--women, children--killed and\n\n[[Page S6807]]\n\nmaimed when war was not really necessary? Was the American public \ndeliberately misled? Was the world?\n  What makes me cringe even more is the continued claim that we are \n``liberators.'' Vice President Cheney, 3 days before the war, said we \nwill be welcomed as liberators. The facts don't seem to support the \nlabel we have so euphemistically attached to ourselves. True, we have \nunseated a brutal, despicable despot, but ``liberation'' implies the \nfollowup of freedom, self-determination and a better life for the \ncommon people of the invaded country. In fact, if the situation in Iraq \nis the result of ``liberation,'' we may have set the cause of freedom \nback 200 years.\n  Despite our high-blown claims of a better life for the Iraqi people, \nwater is scarce, and often foul; electricity is a sometime thing; food \nis in short supply; hospitals are stacked with the wounded and maimed. \nHistoric treasures of the region and of the Iraqi people have been \nlooted, and nuclear material may have been disseminated to heaven knows \nwhere, while U.S. troops, on orders, looked on and guarded the oil \nsupply. That is what they were told to do.\n  Meanwhile, lucrative contracts to rebuild Iraq's infrastructure and \nrefurbish its oil industry are awarded to administration cronies, \nwithout benefit of competitive bidding, and the United States \nsteadfastly resists offers of U.N. assistance to participate. Is there \nany wonder that the real motives of the U.S. Government are the subject \nof worldwide speculation and mistrust?\n  And in what may be the most damaging development, the U.S. appears to \nbe pushing off Iraq's clamor for self-government. Jay Garner has been \nsummarily replaced, and it is becoming all too clear that the smiling \nface of the U.S. as liberator is quickly assuming the scowl of an \noccupier. The image of the boot on the throat has replaced the \nbeckoning hand of freedom. Chaos and rioting only exacerbate that \nimage, as U.S. soldiers try to sustain order in a land ravaged by \npoverty and disease. ``Regime change'' in Iraq has so far meant \nanarchy, curbed only by an occupying military force and a U.S. \nadministrative presence that is evasive about if and when it intends to \ndepart.\n  Democracy and freedom cannot be force fed at the point of an \noccupier's gun. To think otherwise is folly. One has to stop and \nponder. How could we have been so impossibly naive? How could we expect \nto easily plant a clone of U.S. culture, values, and government in a \ncountry so riven with religious, territorial, and tribal rivalries, so \nsuspicious of U.S. motives, and so at odds with the galloping \nmaterialism which drives the western-style economies?\n  As so many warned this administration before it launched its \nmisguided war on Iraq, there is evidence that our crackdown in Iraq is \nlikely to convince 1,000 new bin Ladens to plan other horrors of the \ntype we have seen in the past several days. Instead of damaging the \nterrorists, we have given them new fuel for their fury. We did not \ncomplete our mission in Afghanistan because we were so eager to attack \nIraq. Now it appears that al-Qaida is back with a vengeance. We have \nreturned to orange alert in the U.S., and we may well have destabilized \nthe Mideast region, a region we have never fully understood. We have \nalienated friends around the globe with our dissembling and our haughty \ninsistence on punishing former friends who may not see things quite our \nway. The path of diplomacy and reason have gone out the window to be \nreplaced by force, unilateralism, and punishment for transgressions. I \nread most recently with amazement our harsh castigation of Turkey, our \nlongtime friend and strategic ally. It is astonishing that our \nGovernment is berating the new Turkish government for conducting its \naffairs in accordance with its own Constitution and its democratic \ninstitutions.\n  Indeed, we may have sparked a new international arms race as \ncountries move ahead to develop WMD as a last ditch attempt to ward off \na possible preemptive strike from a newly belligerent U.S. bully which \nclaims the right to hit where and when it wants. In fact, there is \nlittle to constrain this President. This Congress, in what will go down \nin history as its most unfortunate and spineless and thoughtless act, \ngave away its power to declare war for the foreseeable future and \nempowered this President to wage war at will, and not only this \nPresident, but also future Presidents.\n  The amendment that I offered to sunset this nefarious handover of \npower was rejected by the Senate and garnered only 31 votes. I was \namazed, and I am still amazed, that this Senate would reject an \namendment to sunset a thoughtless, nefarious, spineless act on the part \nof this same Senate to hand over this power to declare war to this \nPresident. I cannot believe that the Senate did that. Even now, I \ncannot believe it. It is abhorrent that the Senate would have rejected \nthe sunset provision. So, as it is, there is no sunset. That power goes \non after this President. The next President will have the same power, \nunless Congress steps in and changes the law. Of course, a President \ncan veto a change in the law and that veto, as students of the \nConstitution will know, will require a two-thirds vote to override. It \nis hard to believe that grown, sensible men and women would reject that \nsunset provision--to say nothing of having voted to shift this power \nover to any President, whether he is a Democrat or Republican.\n  As if that were not bad enough, members of Congress are reluctant to \nask questions which are begging to be asked. How long will we occupy \nIraq? We have already heard disputes on the numbers of troops that will \nbe needed to retain order. What is the truth? How costly will the \noccupation and the reconstruction be? No one has given a straight \nanswer. How will we afford this long-term, massive commitment, fight \nterrorism at home, address the serious crisis in domestic health care, \nafford behemoth military spending, and give away billions in tax cuts \namidst a deficit which has climbed to over $340 billion for this year \nalone? If the President's tax cut passes, it will be $400 billion. We \ncower in the shadows while false statements proliferate. We accept soft \nanswers and shaky explanations because to demand the truth is hard, or \nunpopular, or may be politically costly.\n  But I contend that, through it all, the people know. The American \npeople, unfortunately, are used to political shading, political spin, \nand the usual chicanery they hear from public officials. They patiently \ntolerate it up to a point. But there is a line. It may seem to be drawn \nin invisible ink for a time, but eventually it will appear in dark \ncolors tinged with anger. When it comes to shedding American blood, and \nwhen it comes to wreaking havoc on civilians, on innocent women, men, \nand children, callous dissembling is not acceptable. Nothing is worth \nthat kind of lie--not oil, not revenge, not reelection, not somebody's \ngrand pipe dream of a democratic domino theory.\n  Mark my words, the calculated intimidation which we see so often of \nlate by the ``powers that be'' will only keep the loyal opposition \nquiet for just so long because, eventually, like it always does, the \ntruth will emerge. And when it does, this house of cards, built of \ndeceit, will fall!\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I commend my colleagues who serve on \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee and their staffs for the superb \nwork done on the bill before us today. The bill comes to the floor of \nthe Senate at an important time in our Nation's history. We have been \nat war for the past 20 months, ever since the devastating attacks on \nSeptember 11, 2001 brought the violence of terrorism to our own \ncountry. We have come far since then, but we have much farther to go.\n  Our first goal in the war on terrorism was to topple the brutal \nTaliban regime in Afghanistan, to destroy the camps where the al-Qaida \nterrorists who attacked us trained. We have done that. Our Nation's \nmilitary, the finest in the world, successfully led that charge.\n  Today we see in Afghanistan the beginnings of a democracy. We will \ncontinue to help in the future to make sure that order is kept in \nAfghanistan and that it will be a part of the flourishing world \ncommunity.\n  Our second goal was to disarm the dangerous regime of Saddam Hussein \nin Iraq before he could surface and use weapons of mass destruction \nonce more against innocent civilians. We have done that. Again, our \nbrave men and women in uniform successfully\n\n[[Page S6808]]\n\nachieved that important goal in an astounding 3 weeks. It was a charge \nthat was lightning fast in its speed and thunderous in its conclusion. \nNow we are working with other nations and world bodies to guide the \nIraqi people toward stability. In our quest to unearth Saddam Hussein's \nweapons of mass destruction, we are digging up mass graves of thousands \nof innocent people whom Saddam Hussein put to death for opposing him.\n  Mr. President, we may not have found the weapons of mass destruction \nyet, but we have found horrifying mass graves that show the world the \ngrim importance of our success in Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n  The bill before us provides our brave soldiers, sailors, airmen, \nmarines, and their families with the important tools they need to \ncontinue the vital work they are doing.\n  Whether they are active duty or reservists or members of the National \nGuard, they are the ones who must continue the global fight against \nterrorism and against nations ruled by despots who develop or possess \nweapons of mass destruction.\n  I commend my colleagues for authorizing a military pay raise in this \nbill that provides a 3.7-percent across-the-board increase and for an \nadditional raise targeted for experienced midcareer personnel, ranging \nfrom 5.25 to 6.25 percent.\n  I commend the committee for establishing incentive pay in the amount \nof $100 per month for service members who are serving in the Republic \nof Korea. One need look no further than the news headlines on any given \nday to appreciate the stability our presence has on the Korean \npeninsula to keep in check the totalitarian regime in North Korea.\n  I am also glad to see this bill increase family separation pay from \n$100 to $225 per month and increased pay for imminent danger or hostile \nfire from $150 to $225 per month. This is not enough, and anyone \nlistening or who will read this will say it is not enough. It is not. \nBut it is one more thing we can do to show people who are making these \nsacrifices that we want to compensate them in every way we possibly can \nfor a debt we know we will never really be able to repay.\n  I was also pleased the committee agreed to continue the development \nof the Joint Strike Fighter aircraft in the amount of $4.4 billion. \nThere is no question the Joint Strike Fighter is the fighter of the \nfuture, and it will keep America preeminent in defenses for whenever we \nmay need them in whatever place and in whatever way.\n  I also thank my colleagues on the committee for including the \nBipartisan Commission on the Review of the Overseas Military Structure \nof the United States. That is a long way of saying that we are going to \nlook at foreign bases, as well as American bases, as we are making the \ntransition for our Department of Defense into the security assessment \nthat we face today.\n  This is a bill I introduced with Senator Dianne Feinstein of \nCalifornia. I am the chairman of the Military Construction Subcommittee \nof the Appropriations Committee. Senator Feinstein is the ranking \nmember. In looking at military construction, as we have, and the issues \nfacing us with military construction for American bases versus foreign \nbases, it occurred to us that the Department of Defense is in a huge \ntransition now, trying to assess the threats we have and the different \nkinds of threats we have been seeing since 9/11, and we have not kept \nup in military construction requests.\n  As we have seen in Afghanistan and Iraq, the cold war concept guiding \nthe overseas basing for the U.S. military is obsolete. Yet the number, \nstructure, and scope of our overseas bases is still largely alive with \nthe threat of Soviet aggression. The process of when, how, and why we \nbase troops abroad is in need of a thorough examination to assure that \nour basing structure is adequate for the new security environment. This \nlegislation will assess every overseas installation.\n  During the cold war, our primary military mission was to defend our \nNation and our allies from the symmetric Soviet threat of aggression, \nand ``boots on the ground'' in Europe and Asia allowed us to do that. \nEven though the cold war has been over for a decade, our Nation still \nhas 112,000 troops in Europe, 37,000 in Korea, and 45,000 in Japan, \nlargely in installations designed, devised, and intended for the \nthreats of an earlier era.\n\n  Training constraints are evident on many of these bases. The threats \nwe face today are asymmetrical. They are terrorist groups or rogue \nstates gaining weapons of mass destruction. Events of the past decade, \nespecially since 9/11, have taught us that we not only need to maintain \na military presence abroad, but we need to be in a position to support \ncontingencies where we have no permanent bases, such as Kosovo, \nAfghanistan, Africa, and throughout the Middle East.\n  In the final analysis, we may need more troops overseas, not fewer, \nbut clearly the needs are different than they once were, and it is \ncritical that the United States move beyond the cold war basing \nconcepts. This is not simply a matter of security, although that is a \nsufficient concern, but also of assuring that taxpayers' dollars are \nwell and wisely spent.\n  The Defense Department has requested as of right now $174 million for \nKorea and $284 million for Germany for new military construction next \nyear. That is a large bill for a model in transition. In South Korea, \nour soldiers often serve on the same patches of ground U.S. troops \noccupied when the Korean war ended in 1953.\n  Today, these training areas are inadequate to accommodate the \nextended reach of our weapons and the rapid pace of modern maneuver \nwarfare. In fact, more than 7,000 U.S. troops are stationed at the \nYongsan Army Garrison which was built by the colonial Japanese Army \nbefore World War II.\n  In Grafenwoehr, Germany, our troops train on tank and artillery \nranges used by the Bavarian Army over 100 years ago. The army has \npoured hundreds of millions of dollars into the complex in the past \ndecade, even though the best training area consists of 18,000 acres of \nland, a postage stamp compared to the 400,000 acres of maneuver area \nand ranges available at the National Training Center in California, or \nthe more than 1 million acres at Fort Bliss's MacGregor Range on the \nTexas-New Mexico border.\n  Further complicating matters, the Defense Department is preparing for \nanother round of domestic base closures in 2005. As we scrutinize \nstateside military installations, we must take a look at our worldwide \nstructures as well.\n  To make sure we get the answers to these questions right, our \nbipartisan legislation that Senator Feinstein and I introduced and is \nincluded in this bill would create a congressional commission to take \nan objective and thorough look at our overseas basing structure.\n  The commission will consider criteria to determine whether our bases \nare prepared to meet our needs in the 21st century. It will be \ncomprised of national security and foreign affairs experts who will \nprovide a comprehensive analysis of our worldwide base and force \nstructure to the 2005 domestic Base Realignment and Closure Commission.\n  We certainly want to work with the Pentagon. This is a timely review. \nSome in the Pentagon have suggested that the 2005 BRAC could result in \nthe closure of one in every four domestic bases. But if we are going to \nreduce our presence overseas, we will certainly need stateside bases to \nstation returning troops.\n  It is senseless to close bases in the United States only to later \nrealize we made a costly and irrevocable mistake, a painful lesson we \nlearned in the last rounds of closures.\n  Our national security strategy is shifting to take on the new threats \nfacing our Nation. The position of U.S. troops around the globe must \nreflect that thinking.\n\n  I appreciate what the committee did in including this legislation \nthat Senator Feinstein and I introduced. It will be a major component \nof a future BRAC, and I hope a major part of the thinking at the \nPentagon about what our threats are and where we need troops to be able \nto address those threats.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 763\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk, No. \n763, and I ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mrs. Hutchison] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 763.\n\n\n[[Page S6809]]\n\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To add availability of family support services to the matters \nrequired to be included in the report on the conduct of Operation Iraqi \n                        Freedom in section 1023)\n\n       On page 273, between lines 17 and 18, insert the following:\n       (P) The results of a study, carried out by the Secretary of \n     Defense, regarding the availability of family support \n     services provided to the dependents of members of the \n     National Guard and other reserve components of the Armed \n     Forces who are called or ordered to active duty (hereinafter \n     in this subparagraph referred to as ``mobilized members''), \n     including, at a minimum, the following matters:\n       (i) A discussion of the extent to which cooperative \n     agreements are in place or need to be entered into to ensure \n     that dependents of mobilized members receive adequate family \n     support services from within existing family readiness groups \n     at military installations without regard to the members' \n     armed force or component of an armed force.\n       (ii) A discussion of what additional family support \n     services, and what additional family support agreements \n     between and among the Armed Forces (including the Coast \n     Guard), are necessary to ensure that adequate family support \n     services are provided to the families of mobilized members.\n       (iii) A discussion of what additional resources are \n     necessary to ensure that adequate family support services are \n     available to the dependents of each mobilized member at the \n     military installation nearest the residence of the \n     dependents.\n       (iv) The additional outreach programs that should be \n     established between families of mobilized members and the \n     sources of family support services at the military \n     installations in their respective regions.\n       (v) A discussion of the procedures in place for providing \n     information on availability of family support services to \n     families of mobilized members at the time the members are \n     called or ordered to active duty.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, as I have traveled across Texas and \nvisit military bases, I have met with many military members and their \nfamilies. The feedback I have received from the members and the spouses \nwas that the military services provided wonderful family support during \nthe conflict in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n  I also heard that some family members who were deployed, particularly \nfrom the National Guard and Reserve, need better access to family \nsupport resources at the nearest military base. Because many Guard and \nReserve personnel do not live where they serve, family members do not \nget to develop the relationships with the nearest family support \nservice, and if it is provided by a different military service or \ncomponent, than their own, it is a special hardship.\n  To work toward ensuring that families of our Guard and Reserve \npersonnel are adequately served, I have introduced an amendment that \nrequires the Secretary of Defense to include in his report on the \nconduct of Operation Iraqi Freedom a study of family support services \nprovided to the dependents of National Guard and other Reserve \ncomponents of the Armed Forces who are called to active duty.\n  This amendment requires the Secretary to address the extent to which \ninterservice cooperative agreements are in place to support dependents \nof mobilized members, regardless of the member's service or if they are \na member of the National Guard or Reserve, and to outline what \nadditional outreach programs should be established to support \ndependents in the region of an existing military base or post.\n  It also asks the Department of Defense to identify additional \nresources necessary to ensure that adequate family support services are \navailable to dependents of mobilized members at the nearest military \ninstallation to the residence of the dependents.\n  Family support access is one key lesson that we are learning from the \nfrequent and extended mobilization of members of the National Guard and \nReserve to help fight our ongoing wars. We never intended to use our \nGuard and Reserve this much. It is important to note that their \nfamilies also serve through their sacrifices and commitment, and \napproving this amendment is the least we can do to help them.\n  I ask for a vote on the amendment, but I also want to say that \nbecause of the constraints put forward about the relevancy of \namendments, I ask the distinguished chairman and ranking member if they \nwould work with me in conference to give this amendment the direction \nthat it originally had. It is now part of a report. It would not cost \nanything, but it would hopefully eventually direct the Department of \nDefense to establish these communication systems so our Guard and \nReserve families will have the same access to support services when \nthey are on active duty that an active-duty person's family would have.\n  So I ask for that commitment from the distinguished chairman to work \nwith me in conference to give that direction and then I will ask for a \nvote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I say to our distinguished colleague, I compliment her on \nthe need to have more focus on these very important subjects regarding \nfamilies. As I listened, I harkened back to my days and the composition \nof the Armed Forces in World War II and Korea. Far less than half were \nfamily. Today, three-quarters are family. The Army--and I expect other \nservices but I have certainly heard in the Army--today they call it a \nfamily army. As we marched along this road to where, say, three-\nquarters now are hopefully blessed by a strong family background, I \nguess we have not kept apace with those matters which the Senator has \nenunciated today.\n  So speaking for myself, I certainly indicate that I will work closely \nwith the Senator, and knowing the interest of my good friend and \ncolleague from Michigan in this area, I can assume we will work \ntogether to strengthen the concepts in the report.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the chairman very much for that comment. I \nthink the Senator is right. People do not realize that the makeup of \nour Armed Forces is much different today demographically than it was in \nthe past. There are more families. There are two-service families, and \nit used to be mostly single people. So we have had to make \naccommodations which I think the distinguished chairman and ranking \nmember and the committee have done in many areas, such as in health \ncare. We did not have to have pediatricians as a reliable component of \nhealth care in the military so much in the past as we do now, or OB/\nGYN, but those are the issues we must address today.\n  I am pleased the Senator is doing so, and I hope we will all work \ntogether.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank our colleague. Back in prehistoric \ntimes when I joined the Marines, on the first day you were issued your \nrifle and the second day they told you if you were contemplating a \nwife, you bad better wait. The Marine Corps would issue that, too, at \nthe appropriate time. So things have changed.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Things have changed for sure.\n  If the ranking member would also work with, that would be very much \nappreciated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I commend the Senator from Texas for this amendment. I \nhave, as recently as last weekend been reminded about the role of \nfamilies as I joined hundreds of families and family members in \nwelcoming home the National Guardsmen and Reserve officers from their \ntour of duty in Iraq. I was in Battle Creek, MI, to receive back the \n110th Tactical Fighter Wing. The contribution of our Guard and Reserve \nis more and more relied upon, I agree with the Senator, to too great an \nextent. We have to do something about that.\n  In the meantime, families are at the center of this effort and we \nmust do more for families. I know the chairman of our committee will \nseek to protect the language we are adding and enhance it in \nconference, and I will join him in that effort.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, as so many Members in the past few months, \nwe have experienced moments of joy and moments of sorrow, sorrow in \nattending funerals for those who paid the ultimate price in our \nengagements in Afghanistan and Iraq. Members have attended those \nfunerals and there we see the family in a way that brings to mind the \nimportance of, up until that moment did we give them the care they \ndeserved? And are we now giving them the care they need after the loss \nof their uniformed member?\n\n[[Page S6810]]\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I say to the distinguished chairman of \nthe committee, I think the committee went a long way toward exactly the \npoint we are making, and that is we will never be able to repay fully \nthose family members who have lost their loved ones.\n  I have talked to a mother who lost her only son, and she had lost her \nhusband. She has nothing else left in life. There are many stories like \nthat. But the chairman has gone a long way toward trying to compensate \nin the only way Congress can, by adding money for support services, \nadding money for the hardships, making sure health care is better, \ndoing what we can do in Congress, though we know from our hearts we \nwill never repay these people in totality. We cannot. We do want them \nto know that with the monetary compensation and the benefits we are \ngiving, there is a deep respect for what they have done for our country \nthat will last throughout eternity.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank our distinguished colleague. She \nvery much was active in the work of the committee. In years past, she \nwas on the committee. She has not left it in a sense because the \nSenator gave us the encouragement to put in a number of these measures. \nSo I thank my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. WARNER. I find that the Senate is heavily engaged in committee \nmeetings and briefings, and if it is agreeable to the Senator from \nTexas, I suggest we do a voice vote. Is that acceptable?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. That would be acceptable.\n  Mr. WARNER. Would that be acceptable to the Senator from Michigan?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Hutchison \namendment No. 763.\n  The amendment (No. 763) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 722\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 722 which is \nat the desk.\n  I want to be sure we have an understanding as to the time \ndistribution. I ask the manager of the bill if an agreement has been \nentered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No unanimous consent exists with respect to \ntime.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Lautenberg] for himself, \n     Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Akaka, and Mr. Lieberman, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 722.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To modify requirements applicable to the limitation on \n designation of critical habitat for conservation of protected species \nunder the provision on military readiness and conservation of protected \n                                species)\n\n       On page 48, beginning on line 16, strike ``if the Secretary \n     determines that'' and all that follows through page 48, line \n     20, and insert the following: ``if the Secretary of the \n     Interior determines in writing that--\n       ``(1) the management activities identified in the plan will \n     effectively conserve the threatened species and endangered \n     species within the lands or areas covered by the plan; and\n       ``(2) the plan provides assurances that adequate funding \n     will be provided for such management activities.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield for a unanimous consent agreement \nwhich I believe the Senator is interested in.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield.\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask unanimous consent there be a time limitation of 60 \nminutes equally divided in the usual form with debate on the \nLautenburg-Jeffords amendment No. 722 prior to a vote in relation to \nthe amendment, and that no other amendments be in order prior to a vote \nin relation to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the managers.\n  The amendment is cosponsored by Senator Jeffords. I ask unanimous \nconsent also that Senators Akaka and Lieberman be added as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, this bill would exempt the \nDepartment of Defense from respecting critical habitat for endangered \nspecies on its lands. This provision of the bill is flawed for three \nreasons.\n  One, it would severely weaken our country's efforts to protect \nendangered species. There is a lot of effort that has gone into \ndeveloping legislation in protecting endangered species. Seeing them \ndisappear is a painful recognition. We are now beginning to see species \ndisappear from our oceans, the Atlantic Ocean. The newspapers have been \nfeaturing stories about the disappearance of species like cod, halibut, \nand blue marlin. We have to be careful because each of these affects \nthe rest of the ecology. That could be disastrous.\n  Second, this action is simply not necessary to maintain our military \nreadiness. An example is the dispute over Vieques Island in Puerto \nRico, the territory off the mainland of Puerto Rico.\n  Third, it ignores the Defense Department's long record of \nsuccessfully balancing readiness and conservation. We want to do both.\n  Protecting critical habitat has long been an essential tool that \nFederal, State, and local jurisdictions have used to protect endangered \nspecies. When endangered species have no place to live, they perish. \nThe bill before the Senate would allow the Defense Department to ignore \nthe Endangered Species Act in favor of using something called the \nIntegrated Natural Resources Management Plan, called INRMP, for \nthreatened and endangered species. INRMPs are not subject to the same \nstrong standards as those under the Endangered Species Act.\n  Under this bill, no area could be designated a critical habitat on \nDOD property. No matter how threatened the species, no matter what is \nfound on the land, it will not be strongly protected.\n  It is conceivable that the Defense Department could make this \ndecision under that program, even if it is not needed, for them to \nconduct their exercises or their duties. The species have to be \nprotected.\n  My amendment is a reasonable approach. It adds two protections to \nreinforce the effectiveness of the INRMP plans. First, the Secretary of \nthe Interior must determine that the plan would conserve a threatened \nor endangered species, that it has to make sure we try our best to have \nthat species endure. Second, there must be sufficient funding to \nimplement these plans.\n  By applying this two-part standard, DOD could continue to maintain \nits historical success, balancing conservation and military readiness. \nThis type of approach does work.\n  Only two species have gone extinct after being put on the endangered \nspecies list, while over 600 species not on the list have gone extinct \nduring that time.\n  DOD has 25 million acres of land that are home to 300 federally \nlisted, threatened, and endangered species. The Department of Defense \nhas played a crucial role in preventing these species from sliding into \nextinction. It is not suggested anywhere that they want these things to \nhappen, but we have a disagreement on what it will take to keep the \nspecies alive.\n  Camp Pendleton in California is a good example of how the balance has \nworked on the ground. Of 18 species listed as threatened and endangered \non the 125,000 acres, critical habitat has been recommended for only 5 \nof those threatened species. Yet using the flexibility built into the \nEndangered Species Act, the Fish and Wildlife Service decided to \nrestrict less than 1 percent of all potential training areas from use \nfor training exercises.\n\n  In his testimony before the Armed Services Committee last March, GEN \nNyland, Assistant Commandant for the Marine Corps, agreed that \ncodifying an effectiveness test for the INRMPs would provide DOD with \ngreater certainty in its decisionmaking. That is the purpose of this \namendment.\n  The American people have also spoken on this issue. We should listen. \nAccording to a recent Zogby poll, 85 percent of registered voters \nbelieve the\n\n[[Page S6811]]\n\nDefense Department should follow the same environmental laws as \neveryone else. The two-part test in my amendment will help assure that \nDOD continues to do its part in conserving endangered species.\n  As I said before, I think they really want that to happen. The \nquestion is what the approach is going to be. The issue is about \nbalancing national security with our environmental security and the \nPentagon has shown in the past that we can do it. I urge my colleagues \nto support my amendment.\n  From our half hour of time, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nVermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Like many of my colleagues, I am a veteran. I have the \ngreatest respect for those who serve this Nation. I served the Naval \nReserves for 30 years and was on active duty in the Navy in the 1950s. \nMy ship, the McNair, was the first U.S. military ship to navigate the \nSuez Canal after the Egyptians took control of the canal in 1955. I am \na member of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the VFW.\n  Like every Senator, I am concerned about our troops on our military \nbases in the States and throughout the world. I want them to have every \nadvantage as they prepare for and engage in military conflict.\n  However, sweeping changes to environmental laws, even with changes \nthat are proposed during the time our country is at war, should be \nconsidered by the Environment and Public Works Committee. Our committee \nis charged with understanding the implications of change in these laws \nas well as the need for change and to weigh the consequences to public \nhealth and the environment.\n  As our distinguished colleague who chairs the Armed Services \nCommittee observed in a recent hearing in our Committee, these laws \nhave taken years to put in place.\n  However, Section 322 of S. 1050, the National Defense Authorization \nAct for Fiscal Year 2004 contains a provision that would change how \ncritical habitat is designated under the Endangered Species Act, a law \nwithin the jurisdiction of the Environment and Public works Committee.\n  Section 322 prohibits the Secretary of the Interior from designating \ncritical habitat on any Department of Defense lands that have an \nintegrated natural resources management plan, known as INRMP, prepared \nunder the Sikes Act, if the Secretary determines that the plan \naddresses special management consideration, or protection.\n  The INRMP provisions of the Sikes Act were never intended to be a \nsubstitute for the Endangered Species Act, but rather a complement to \nit.\n  As a complementary conservation measure, INRMP is not subject to the \nsame rigorous implementation requirements as conservation measures \ntaken under the Endangered Species Act, such as being based on the \n``best available science.''\n  INRMPs are often substandard compared to the ESA, and the required \nINRMP components under the Sikes Act cannot be universally relied upon \nto accomplish species conservation goals.\n  In addition, Section 7(j) of the Endangered Species Act already \nallows the law's requirements to be waived, at the request of the \nSecretary of Defense, when national security concerns outweigh those of \nspecies conservation. To date, no Secretary of Defense has ever \nutilized this flexibility in the Act. Granting a blanket exemption to \nthe ESA removes the ability for decisions to be made on a case by case \nbasis when national security concerns are real.\n  After hearings in the Environment and Public Works Committee both \nlast year and this year, on this issue and the other DOD proposals \nwithin the jurisdiction of the EPW Committee, I do not believe the case \nhas been made to warrant these changes to existing law.\n  However, the bill before us contains a provision that would \nsubstantially change the way critical habitat is protected on \nDepartment of Defense lands.\n  The amendment offered by myself and Senators Lautenberg and Akaka \nwill help to ensure that important protections underlying the \nEndangered Species Act will not be lost under the integrated natural \nresource management plans developed under the Sikes Act and this \nDefense Authorization bill.\n  The amendment would require that the Secretary of the Interior \ndetermine in writing that the Integrated Natural Resources Management \nPlan will effectively conserve the threatened and endangered species \ncovered by the plan and assure that adequate funding is provided for \nthe management activities.\n  This means that if land is needed for a species and military \ntraining, the Secretary of the Interior will review the Defense \nDepartment's plan for managing the lands and funding the management \nactivities to make sure that species will be adequately protected.\n  The Department of Defense and the Department of the Interior have \nbeen working together to balance needs of the military for training \nwith the needs of endangered species for survival. This amendment \naffirms that balance.\n  It is my hope that the two agencies will continue to work \ncooperatively and I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I yield to the Senator from Hawaii.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Madam President, I rise today in support of the \nLautenberg-Jeffords amendment to establish minimum criteria for whether \nan Integrated Natural Resource Management Plan or INRMP for a military \ninstallation provides sufficient protection for endangered species to \nmake a critical habitat designation unnecessary. As I have previously \nstated, I commend the chairman of the Readiness Subcommittee for the \nmanner in which he handled this difficult issue. We had two very good \nhearings to address the Department's proposal.\n  I am particularly appreciative that the provision in this bill takes \na case-by-case approach to the Endangered Species Act instead of \nproviding the blanket exemption sought in the administration proposal. \nI believe the provision fall short, however, of codifying the existing \ncase-by-case approach.\n  During the Committee's consideration of this bill, I offered an \namendment which would have codified the case-by-case approach by \nincluding minimum criteria for INRMPs on military lands. Unfortunately, \nmy amendment was defeated. I am pleased to join Senators Lautenberg and \nJeffords in this amendment which, I believe, provides the necessary \ncriteria to be included in INRMPs for military lands in order for the \nSecretary of the Interior to determine that the designation of critical \nhabitat is unnecessary.\n  As the ranking member of the Readiness Subcommittee, I remain \ncommitted to the readiness of our military through proper training. We \nhave heard from the Joint Chiefs of Staff that our Armed Forces are \nmore ready today than they have been before. Our military has found \nways to comply with applicable laws by working with neighboring \ncommunities, state and local officials. I firmly believe that this \napproach provides the Department of Defense with the necessary tools \nand assurances it needs to conduct training activities without \nunnecessarily undermining environmental provisions. I urge my colleague \nto support this amendment.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Madam President, I have no further requests for time. I \nsee my chairman standing. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I yield myself such time as I consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I have been listening with great \ninterest to the debate. I start out saying I have some similarities to \nthe previous speaker from Vermont. I am a veteran, I should say.\n  Also, the reference was made to the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee. I do agree with the Senator from Vermont that there is a \njurisdiction thing there in which we are interested. However, there is \nalso one having to do with the readiness, with the authorization bill \nthat is under consideration now.\n\n[[Page S6812]]\n\n  I can't tell you how strongly I feel about this particular amendment. \nThis is something we have been discussing now, not for just days or \nweeks but for years. We have actually had several hearings. Right now, \nwe have had some 12 hearings in the past 2 years on this subject. Some \nof this was when I chaired the Readiness Subcommittee of the Senate \nArmed Services Committee. We have had hearings there and, of course, \nhearings in the Environment and Public Works Committee.\n  I share the compliments to Senator Ensign, in the way he has been \nchairing this committee and spending the time on this very critical \nsubject.\n  Let me just remind everybody that when INRMP first came along, the \nIntegrated National Resource Management Plan, they came along not in a \nRepublican administration, they came along in the Clinton \nadministration. They recognized at that time the seriousness of proper \ntraining and the fact that we have a very serious problem affecting \nsome of the environment encroachments on our limited land area. It is \nsomething that is measured, not by cost of training, not by \neffectiveness of training, as much as it is human lives.\n  The Senator from New Jersey talked about the Endangered Species Act. \nI spent 3 years and lost trying to stop the prohibition of live-fire \ntraining on a Navy range on land we own in Vieques. I have a \nbackground, as does the Senator from Vermont, in having gone through \ntraining. I am sure he would share this with me. When we went through \ntraining and crawled under inert fire, it was quite a bit different \nfrom crawling under live fire. This is the kind of training that I \nthink we had in Vieques--integrated training, which we don't have \ntoday. In Kuwait, we lost five lives, four of whom were Americans. If \nyou read the accident report, it very clearly states that we lost those \nlives because we didn't have adequate live-fire training. It was denied \nus right before that time at the range in Vieques.\n  I am going to talk about Camp Pendleton.\n  Before I do so, the Senator from New Jersey had talked about Camp \nPendleton and how compatible everything has been in Camp Pendleton. He \nsuggests that in Camp Pendleton there are some 17 miles of shoreline. \nWe can only train in some 200 yards of that area. It is a very serious \nmatter.\n  I agree that we have very well-trained troops in the field. But I \nalso say we are not enjoying the state of readiness that our troops are \nentitled to have--unlimited capability of training in a live and \nintegrated relationship.\n  The Lautenberg amendment would essentially gut the bill language \nbecause it would impose an unachievable standard of recovering species \naccording to the legal definition of concern. DOD would be forced to \nguarantee sufficient funding to accomplish species recovery while the \nDepartment of Interior and Endangered Species Act have not been able to \nrecover species.\n  This is very important. We have had since 1973--30 years--the \nEndangered Species Act. Yet no species have come off the list as a \nresult of operation of the Endangered Species Act. In other words, he \nis putting on a test that cannot be fulfilled. In other words, we are \nnot going to be able to have this type of training.\n  This is the quote from a committee hearing which we had. This was the \nDeputy General Counsel for Environment and Installations. It gets into \nthe question as to how this is going to affect the training:\n\n       With respect to the ESA, what our proposal seeks to do is \n     to codify a policy that was adopted during the Clinton \n     administration with respect to the INRMPs.\n\n  Then Craig Manson said:\n\n       I concur as to the ESA provision.\n\n  The amendment is very similar to the amendment that Senator Akaka \ntried to get approved in committee. Normally, Senator Akaka and I agree \non these issues. During the years when I was chairman of the Readiness \nSubcommittee of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and he was my \nranking member, and during the years he was chairman, I was his ranking \nmember, we normally agreed on these issues.\n  However, I believe the Lautenberg amendment goes much further than \nthe Akaka amendment went because it is an amendment that gets very \nserious in terms of forcing something to come off the list.\n  The essential difference between Senator Akaka's failed amendment in \ncommittee and Senator Lautenberg's amendment is a subtle but crucial \ndifference between ``provide conservation benefit for the species,'' \nwhich Senator Akaka wanted to do and which I can understand, and \nprovide a conservation benefit as Senator Lautenberg wants to do, which \nis ``conserve the species.'' In other words, recover. Recovery is \nsomething that can't happen. It has never happened. I will read to you \nfrom the Endangered Species Act of 1973. It said in addressing the \nterms ``conserving'' and ``conservation'' that it means ``to use and \nuse all methods and procedures which are necessary to bring any \nendangered species or threatened species to the point at which the \nmeasures provided pursuant to this act are no longer necessary. Such \nmethods and procedures include but are not limited to all activities \nassociated with scientific resources and management, such as research, \nlaw enforcement, habitat acquisition and maintenance promulgation, live \ntrapping, transplanting,'' and it goes on and on.\n\n  It says you must be able to recover. As he said, never have we been \nable to recover a species that was actually a result of the operation \nof the ESA.\n  The Department of Defense opposes the amendment because, No. 1, the \nlanguage could have perverse and unintended consequences such as \ndepriving the Fish and Wildlife Service the flexibility to refine the \nconditions in light of further experience or to tailor them more \nspecifically to diverse sites. The language would give rise to \nlitigation.\n  As the chart shows, again quoting Craig Manson:\n\n       In fact, the process of using the Integrated Natural \n     Resources Management Plan is a collaborative process that \n     requires the agreement of the Fish and Wildlife Service and \n     INRMP and cannot be approved without the agreement of the \n     Fish and Wildlife Service. The Service will continue to be \n     involved. Habitat will continue to be afforded the \n     protections that are necessary for the conservation of the \n     species.\n\n  I think most of us understand. That is the seriousness that we are \ndealing with right now.\n  The next concern we have is the lawsuits which are now preventing \ncontinuation of a policy started by the implementation of the Clinton/\nGore administration. And we are talking about the INRMP.\n  This is Jamie Irappaport Clark, the Clinton administration's Director \nof the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. He said:\n\n       Do I believe that Integrated Natural Resource Management \n     Plans can provide the needs for conservation of listed \n     species? Absolutely.\n\n  This came from the Clinton administration--not from the current \nadministration. That was the Clinton Fish and Wildlife Director, Jamie \nClark, who initiated the practice and gave the testimony before our \ncommittee.\n  The marine field training is rated ``not combat capable'' at Camp \nPendleton.\n  I am glad the Senator from New Jersey brought up Camp Pendleton. Camp \nPendleton is a good model to use as to what we don't want to do. Camp \nPendleton has all of these 17 miles of shoreline. We can only use some \n200 yards. In fact, if you look at the shoreline, that 200 yards is so \nsmall that it doesn't even show up on the map. This shows the proposed \ncritical habitat at the Marine Corps base at Camp Pendleton, 57 \npercent. That tells us what is happening to our training area.\n  What is the result of that? The encroachment impact of training \ndegradation at Camp Pendleton in the field of ``not combat capable'' is \nfifty percent. Fifty percent of the training that takes place has that \ncategory of T-4, which is ``not combat capable,'' and 69 percent is \n``combat capable'' for only a low threat. That is what is happening.\n  How does that translate into lives? We don't know. As I mentioned, we \nhave lost lives because of a lack of training. This is one that is very \nserious.\n  The Department of Defense set out to establish quantity of data on \nencroachment selecting the Marine Corps base at Camp Pendleton as the \nsubject of the study and came to the conclusion that 50 percent of that \ntraining would not be combat ready.\n\n[[Page S6813]]\n\n  That is how serious this is.\n  More holistic than mere designation of critical habitat, the \nmanagement plan we are talking about, the INRMP approach, pioneered by \nthe Clinton-Gore administration, considers habitat, food, water, \npredators, noise, and many more factors.\n  The Fish and Wildlife Service opposed the Lautenberg amendment.\n  Let me conclude by saying this is very serious. I could be talking \nabout ranges other than Pendleton. Pendleton I talked about because \nthat was brought up by the Senator from New Jersey. In the case of Camp \nLejeune, in the case of Fort Bragg in the southeastern part of the \nUnited States, we are down now to just a small portion that can be used \nfor training.\n  I invite my colleagues to go down to Fort Bragg, go down to Camp \nPendleton, and look and see how they are inhibited from being able to \nhave the type of training that will really prepare them properly for \ncombat in harm's way to which we will be sending them.\n  I think it is very significant. There is not an issue in this bill \nthat is more significant now than trying to do what we can to provide \ngood training. It has been said before--and I would have to echo it--\nthat the military has been an excellent steward of the environment. And \nthat is part of the problem. If you go to Fort Bragg today, after \nhaving been there 2 years ago, you see many more of these red ribbons \naround areas precluding them from being able to train there because of \nthe urban sprawl and other encroachments on our training capabilities.\n  Our language is very good, and I would encourage us, at the time we \nvote, to reject the Lautenberg amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I thank our colleague from Oklahoma. I \nalso thank our distinguished colleague from this side. It looks as if \nwe are going to conclude this debate such that the Senate can turn to a \nrollcall vote at about 2:45.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, how much time is left on this side on this \namendment that is now pending?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fourteen and a half minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask my friend from Vermont, how much \ntime do you need?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. About 5 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Would that be appropriate?\n  Mr. WARNER. I do want our distinguished colleague from Nevada, who is \nthe chairman of the subcommittee----\n  Mr. REID. How much time does the Senator from Nevada need?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Probably 7 or 8 minutes. I will try to cut it off by \n2:45.\n  Mr. REID. Why don't we have the vote at 2:50?\n  Mr. WARNER. That would be helpful and enable Senators to speak.\n  Mr. REID. That would be 15 minutes, each having 7\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Fine.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, while we are here, the Senator from \nVirginia has also said he would agree that the next amendment in order \nis Harkin. That is already the order, but the time on that will be one-\nhalf hour evenly divided in the usual form regarding second-degree \namendments.\n  Mr. WARNER. Right.\n  Mr. REID. Following that amendment, Senator Bingaman has an amendment \non missile defense which Senator Warner has reviewed.\n  Mr. WARNER. Right.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Bingaman has agreed to a 30-minute time agreement \non that. That would be under the usual form relating to second-degree \namendments. I ask that in the form of a unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. WARNER. No objection on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. The reason we have done this is there is a briefing at 3 \no'clock. We could stack the two votes, the Harkin and Bingaman votes, \nat around 4 o'clock, thereabouts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Madam President, I would like to talk just a minute \nabout the need for available space for training. I was in the Navy. I \nwas on board a destroyer. I was a gunnery officer. We were involved in \nwartime activity in Lebanon. Our training and all was for shore-fire \nbombardment. I understand what is needed and what is necessary, and I \nknow this bill is carefully crafted to ensure there will be adequate \nspace for the types of operations I participated in. I know our \nmilitary is pretty efficient and there are areas that are designated \nthat they cannot hit. There is always a chance they might, but they can \nrearrange things to make sure those areas are not in their gun sights. \nIt is not anything that is of great difficulty to do. These are huge \nareas.\n  So I think the arrangement we have under this amendment is very \nreasonable and, from my own experience, quite possible to keep \neverybody happy. So I disagree with the comments of my chairman.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, as chairman of the subcommittee which \nreviewed this proposal and included this proposal on the Endangered \nSpecies Act, I want to spend a couple minutes to educate our colleagues \non why it is important to defeat this amendment that has been proposed.\n  First of all, we held two hearings--Senator Akaka and I did--and we \nworked beautifully together. Senator Akaka is a wonderful person to \nwork with. Our staffs worked really well together. On several of the \nproposals the administration had put up on the environment, we held \nhearings. We brought in experts from both sides. Everybody was \nrepresented. We had very fair hearings. I think everybody who was in \nattendance would agree the hearings were fair and balanced.\n  Out of those hearings came a couple of findings: One is that over the \nlast 20 years the military has done a fabulous job with its ranges in \nprotecting habitat as well as endangered or threatened species. I think \nthere is no disputing that.\n  In the past, I think there certainly were some mistakes that were \nmade by the military. But in the last 20 years or so we have done a \nreally good job with our armed services protecting the habitat and the \nspecies on these various ranges.\n  What has happened now is we are in a situation where the courts, \ninstead of allowing what has happened with some of these what are \ncalled Integrated Natural Resource Management Plans, which are in place \nand have done a great job protecting the species and the habitat--what \nthe courts are threatening to do, and it looks as if it is going to \nhappen, is those will no longer be able to be used. We will have to go \nwith much stricter definitions, much more costly ways of doing \nbusiness, and a lot of the ranges will be shut down.\n  I am the chairman of the Readiness Subcommittee. We are in charge to \nmake sure our armed services are ready when they are called upon to \ndefend the United States of America.\n  I have a letter I would like to have printed in the Record. I ask \nunanimous consent that be the order.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   Chairman of the\n\n\n                                        Joint Chiefs of Staff,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 21, 2003.\n     Hon. John Warner,\n     Chairman, Senate Armed Services Committee, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Warner: I would like to underscore the \n     critical importance of the Endangered Species Act language as \n     currently contained in S. 1050, the Defense Department \n     Authorization Bill.\n       The Department of Defense's primary mission is to maintain \n     our Nation's military readiness. We possess the most ready, \n     capable armed forces in the world; however, expanding trends \n     in environmental restrictions are significantly impacting \n     military training and operational readiness.\n       We need your continued support to restore needed balance \n     between environmental and national security concerns, and to \n     protect activities essential to prepare our men and women for \n     combat.\n       Thank you again for your strong leadership and concern for \n     America's military.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             Richard B. Myers,\n\n                                                   Chairman of the\n                                            Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. This letter pretty much sums up what we try do in this \nbill. We\n\n[[Page S6814]]\n\nare balancing environmental protections with military readiness. \nSometimes these are competing concerns.\n  We did not overreach in this bill. We struck a balance. We struck a \nvery delicate balance, but we think we have struck a balance.\n  If anybody has any questions, they just have to go visit our military \nranges in Southern California, in the Carolinas. Wherever you go across \nthe country, visit our ranges and you will see some of the most \npristine areas you can find, some of the best protected habitat you can \nfind, and these endangered and threatened species are flourishing.\n  It is not a question of this bill rolling back environmental \nprotections. We do not want the courts putting such limits on the \nmilitary that they cannot go forward in this balance in the future, \nwhere we protect species and habitat and we ensure military readiness \nfor our armed services.\n  A couple of specific problems with this amendment: The INRMP sites \nand the Endangered Species Act are complementary statutory frameworks \nthat together ensure protection of endangered and threatened species. \nThe Lautenberg amendment introduces an unnecessary and complicated \nrequirement, and we believe--the Department of Defense and the \nDepartment of the Interior believe--it will lead to more lawsuits, not \nless. We are trying to get away from the lawsuits and make sure we are \nspending the money instead of fighting legal battles in protecting the \nspecies and making sure we are ready for what our armed services are \ncalled to do.\n\n  I ask our colleagues to seriously take a look at this. We just saw \nthe results of great readiness in Iraq. The arguments were made: We are \nready; there is not going to be a problem.\n  We were ready because our ranges were able to be used. If we roll \nback the ability to use our ranges, we will not be ready. We will not \nhave the kind of military readiness we need in future conflicts. That \nis why it is so important that we do as the language in the bill \nsuggests, protect the balance between environmental protection and \nmilitary readiness.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it is opportune the Senate is considering \nthe National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2004 just after \nthe successful military action in Iraq. Unfortunately, as is the case \nwith many of the efforts undertaken by this administration, there is an \nattempt to bypass environmental regulations under the cover of some \nnational guise--in this instance military preparedness. In particular, \nI am incensed by section 322, which would prohibit the Secretary of the \nInterior from designating critical habitat on any Department of \nDefense, DOD, lands that have an Integrated Management Natural \nResources Plan, INRMP.\n  The Sikes Act was never intended to be a substitute for the ESA but \nrather a complement to it. The Sikes Act is clear that it does not \n``affect any provision of a Federal law governing the conservation or \nprotection of fish and wildlife resources.'' As a complementary \nconservation measure, INRMPs are not subject to the same rigorous \nimplementation requirements as conservation measures taken under the \nESA, such as being based on the ``best available science.'' In \naddition, existing Fish and Wildlife Service policy allows the presence \nof ESA requirements to function as an incentive to DOD land managers to \ndevelop the best INRMPs possible. This policy encourages the \ndevelopment of good INRMPs. A blanket exemption to critical habitat \ndesignations would remove this incentive to practice the best \nstewardship possible.\n  Why the need for such an exemption? The administration would have the \nAmerican public believe that environmental laws, in this instance the \nEndangered Species Act, ESA, infringes upon the readiness of American \ntroops by drastically impeding training exercises. Yet there is even \ndiscord within the administration. At an Environmental Protection \nAgency, EPA, hearing held in the Senate earlier this spring, EPA \nAdministrator Christine Todd Whitman noted that she did not ``believe \nthat there is a training mission anywhere in the country that is being \nheld up or taking place because of an environmental protection \nregulation.'' I have to wonder if it is statements like this, where \nAdministrator Whitman was speaking for the environment and not just \ntoeing the administration line, that helped lead to her recent \nresignation. I hope the administration will fill her shoes with someone \nthat will make protecting the environment his or her first priority as \nI believe Administrator Whitman did under very difficult circumstances.\n  Finally, it is absurd to provide such an exemption when the ESA \nallows for the law's requirements to be waived, at the request of the \nSecretary of Defense, when national security concerns outweigh those of \nspecies conservation and other solutions cannot be found. To date, no \nSecretary of Defense has ever utilized the flexibility in this act. \nGranting a blanket exemption to the ESA removes the ability for \ndecisions to be made on a case-by-case basis and only when national \nsecurity concerns are real.\n  This administration's continued attack on over 30 years of \nimplementing environmental laws is in blatant disregard to the \nsentiment of the American public. A recent poll showed that over one-\nhalf of the American public felt that the U.S. Government was not doing \nenough to protect the environment and three-quarters of those polled \nwanted to see stronger enforcement of these laws. Yet, again and again, \nwhether allowing for future inclusion of wilderness into the Federal \nlands, mining in protected grizzly bear habitat in Montana, or the \npossible forfeiture of thousands of miles of road systems on Federal \nlands, this administration continues to shut the American public out of \nthe debate over the protection of their environment. I call upon my \ncolleagues to stop this attack by the administration and strip section \n322 from the National Defense Authorization Act.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I rise to support the amendment offered \nby Senators Lautenberg and Jeffords to the Department of Defense \nauthorization bill.\n  The bill before us would block any designation of critical habitat \nunder the Endangered Species Act on any Department of Defense lands.\n  The Department of Defense controls 25 million acres of land where \nsome of the best habitat remains for more than 300 threatened and \nendangered plants and animals.\n  Since critical habitat designations would not be applied to military \nlands, the Lautenberg-Jeffords amendment would add two simple \nrequirements to ensure that the Department of Defense develop \nintegrated natural resource management plans to protect species.\n  The amendment would also require the Secretary of the Interior to \nensure that a resource management plan conserves threatened and \nendangered species and is adequately funded.\n  Critical habitat is an important component of the Endangered Species \nAct and provides help to species near extinction by identifying areas \nthat are needed for species survival and recovery.\n  This provision in the bill is not necessary to maintain our military \nreadiness. According to a General Accounting Office report, issued on \nJune 2, 2002, on military training: ``training readiness, as reported \nin official readiness reports, remains high for most units and that the \nlevel of readiness does not support DOD's claims its readiness is being \nhurt by environmental laws.'' The Department of Defense has a strong \nrecord of balancing readiness and conservation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Madam President, I would like to reiterate that there \nis plenty of room for the training. All we ask is to make sure before \nthat training is conducted there are studies done to make sure \nendangered species can be saved and they can reorient where the \ntraining is to accommodate them.\n  The GAO found the military has presented no evidence that the \nEndangered Species Act has impaired training. If the DOD needs an \nexemption from the Endangered Species Act, sections 7(j) and 4(b)(2) \nprovide relief from the designation of critical habitat. The DOD has \nnever sought an exemption under 7(j). How can we say the law needs to \nbe changed when the relief under current law has never been used?\n  I refer the attention of my colleagues to this quote:\n\n\n[[Page S6815]]\n\n\n       The President has said that he wants the Federal Government \n     to be held to the same standards of environmental cleanup as \n     the private sector . . . so, we've [EPA] said you have got to \n     meet the same standards as the private sector.\n\n  That was Christine Todd Whitman on the Dianne Rehm show on May 21, \n2003. And quoting again:\n\n       I don't believe that there is a training mission anywhere \n     in the country that is being held up or not taking place \n     because of the environmental protection regulations.\n\n  That is EPA Administrator Christine Todd Whitman's testimony before \nthe Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works on February 26, \n2003.\n  This is a perfectly reasonable amendment. It will protect and not \ninterfere at all with the training requirements of our Nation. I \nseriously counter the remarks made recently.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. In response to the EPA administrator's quotes we have \nbefore us today, I spoke to the administrator. We had testimony from \nthe EPA following this to try to clear up any kind of confusion. As I \nmentioned, we have not had problems with readiness up to this point \nbecause the Integrated Natural Resource Management Plans have been \nworking well as a balance, making sure habitat and species are \nprotected, but also where readiness could go forward and be maintained \nat a high level. What the military is concerned about is the court \ndecisions that look like they are going to go against the military to \nwhere they will not be able to use the ranges in an effective manner. \nThe statement that was made by Administrator Whitman, 5 years from now, \nwhoever the EPA administrator would be at that time, would not be able \nto be made.\n  People are very concerned that readiness will be severely affected if \nthe court decisions are allowed to go forward. This bill language says \nto the courts, balancing environmental concerns with military readiness \nis working. Let's keep with what is working instead of putting huge \nrequirements on to the military where they will not be able to use the \nranges.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The Senator \nfrom Vermont controls the balance of the time.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield to the ranking member of the committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. How much time does the Senator from Vermont have \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four-and-a-half minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I support the Lautenberg-Jeffords-Akaka \namendment. It has been said earlier in the debate that the DOD \nspokesperson said all the Department wants to do is codify the Clinton \nadministration approach to this issue of endangered species on military \nlands. That is precisely what the Lautenberg amendment does. If we want \nto codify--as the opponents of the amendment say they want--what the \nClinton administration did relative to this issue, this is the way to \ncodify it. If we don't adopt this amendment, it is not in our code. It \nis not codified.\n  I support the amendment and hope it can be adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Madam President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, have the yeas and nays been ordered on \nthe amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 722. The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nEdwards) is necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds for acquiring for inventories of \n the Department of Defense property in excess of the requirements for \n                            the inventories)\n\n       On page 44, between lines 18 and 19, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 313. INVENTORY MANAGEMENT.\n\n       (a) Limitation on Purchase of Excess Inventory.--(1) \n     Subject to paragraph (4), no funds authorized to be \n     appropriated by this Act may be obligated or expended for \n     purchasing items for a secondary inventory of the Department \n     of Defense that would exceed the requirement objectives for \n     that inventory of such items.\n       (2) The Secretary of Defense shall, within 30 days after \n     the date of the enactment of this Act, review all pending \n     orders for the purchase of items for a secondary inventory of \n     the Department of Defense in excess of the applicable \n     requirement objectives for the inventory of such items, and \n     shall ensure compliance with the limitation in paragraph (1) \n     with respect to such items.\n       (3) The Secretary shall, within 30 days after the date on \n     which a requirement objective for an item in a secondary \n     inventory of the Department of Defense is reduced, review all \n     pending orders for the purchase of that item and ensure \n     compliance with the limitation in paragraph (1) with respect \n     to that item.\n       (4) The Secretary may waive the limitation in paragraph (1) \n     in the case of an order for the purchase of an item upon \n     determining and executing a certification that compliance \n     with the limitation in such case--\n       (A) would not result in significant savings; or\n       (B) would harm a national security interest of the United \n     States.\n       (b) Reduction of Excess Inventory.--(1) No funds authorized \n     to be appropriated by\n\n[[Page S6816]]\n\n     this Act may be obligated or expended after March 31, 2004, \n     to maintain or store an inventory of items for the Department \n     of Defense that exceeds the approved acquisition objectives \n     for such inventory of items unless the Secretary of Defense \n     determines that disposal of the excess inventory--\n       (A) would not result in significant savings; or\n       (B) would harm a national security interest of the United \n     States.\n       (2) Not later than January 1, 2004, the Secretary shall \n     establish consistent standards and procedures, applicable \n     throughout the Department of Defense, for ensuring compliance \n     with the limitation in paragraph (1).\n       (c) Report on Inventory Management.--(1) Not later than \n     March 31, 2004, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to \n     Congress a report on--\n       (A) the administration of this section; and\n       (B) the implementation of all recommendations of the \n     Comptroller General for Department of Defense inventory \n     management that the Comptroller General determines are not \n     fully implemented.\n       (2) The Comptroller General shall review the report \n     submitted under paragraph (1) and submit to Congress any \n     comments on the report that the Comptroller General considers \n     appropriate.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Is the time 15 minutes equally divided?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is 30 minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, this amendment seeks to reduce the \nwasteful buildup of unneeded inventory at the Department of Defense. \nBased on the findings of the General Accounting Office, I believe this \namendment would save at least $2 billion annually.\n  Last year, as a member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, I \nrequested that the GAO prepare a report on the inventory requirements \nof the Department of Defense. That report has just been printed and \nreleased dated May 2003. This is the newest in a series that I have had \nGAO undertake in recent years on related topics.\n  Pentagon waste is not a new issue, nor is the issue addressed by my \namendment the only kind of waste that occurs within DOD. People have \npointed out numerous examples of waste in DOD over the years, some \nquite spectacular.\n  Later in my statement I will talk about the other kinds of waste we \nuncovered by past GAO reports that I requested. Much has been done to \nreduce Pentagon waste, and I commend those efforts. The chairman and \nranking member, both, and when they have been in reversed positions, \nhave made a great effort in this regard. We have reduced Pentagon \nwaste.\n\n  However, the Department of Defense remains the largest purchaser of \ngoods in the Federal Government. The size of the bill continues to \nincrease, and we have an authorization bill of $400 billion. That \nincludes $75 billion for procurement. At those levels, we do need to be \nvigilant and we need to perform an ongoing watchdog role. That is what \nthis amendment is aimed to ensure.\n  I am sorry to say, despite the long history of investigations and GAO \nreports, many of the problems still have not been solved. That is why I \noffer this amendment.\n  What the amendment addresses is, the Department of Defense routinely \npurchases and keeps on hand, for the purpose of meeting the \nDepartment's requirements, many items in a category it calls secondary \ninventory. Secondary inventory means spare and repair parts for \nweapons. It also includes clothing, medical, and many other items that \nare not weapon systems themselves. Obviously, there is a large amount \nof such supplies our military needs to keep on hand--over 2 million \nitems.\n  According to the GAO, the Pentagon has approximately $70 billion \nworth of this secondary inventory. Unfortunately, out of the $70 \nbillion worth of secondary inventory, there was about $38 billion in \nexcess or unneeded inventory. So we have $70 billion in secondary \ninventory, much of which is needed; but GAO identified $38 billion in \nwhat they call excess inventory, inventory that the Pentagon says they \ndo not even need. That is more than half of the secondary inventory \nclassified as excess. This is totally unacceptable. It is unacceptable \nthat DOD could find itself with more than half of its secondary \ninventory above their own requirements. I am sure there are valid \nexplanations why some requirements are misjudged, but to end up with \n$38 billion worth of unneeded inventory out of a total of $70 billion \nof inventory seems to me to be a pretty good definition of waste.\n  It is worth pointing out that the Department of Defense generally \nconcurred with this GAO report. The Department did not disagree with \nthese findings.\n  But that is not all. Of the $38 billion in excess secondary \ninventory, according to the GAO, $1.6 billion was still on order. In \nother words, we are still paying contractors to make $1.6 billion worth \nof stuff the Pentagon itself has acknowledged it does not even need. So \nwhy weren't the orders canceled?\n  My amendment addresses this problem in two simple ways. First, it \nrequires the Pentagon to cancel those orders for unneeded items where \nit makes sense; that is, unless the Secretary determines, one, that it \nwill not save money; or, two, the Secretary determines that it will \nharm national security. Unless he finds either one of those, then the \nDepartment must cancel orders for items it does not think it needs.\n  Second, my amendment requires the Pentagon to reduce the excess \ninventory it already has on hand. Again, if the Secretary determines \nthat, (a), it will not save money or, (b), it will harm national \nsecurity, then the Department can keep right on storing these items. \nOtherwise, they have to sell the stuff so we do not pay to keep storing \nit. According to the GAO, that excess inventory on hand was worth about \n$36 billion.\n\n  I believe these two simple steps should save taxpayers at least $2 \nbillion annually without imposing burdensome requirements on the \nDepartment of Defense and without compromising defense readiness.\n  I have requested GAO reports in the past, and many of those reports \nalso found significant waste in the Department of Defense. Reports on \ninventory that the Army and the Navy ship from one location to another \nfound that each service loses track of at least $1 billion worth of \nshipped items every year. Imagine that. They ship it, they do not know \nif they shipped it, and they do not know if anyone got it. They lose \ntrack of $1 billion a year in inventory.\n  Last July, another report revealed a complete breakdown in tracking \nand control of Air Force inventory shipped to contractors. The Air \nForce could not make sure that contractors had asked for items they \nneeded, they could not make sure they had received what was sent, and \nthey could not make sure they used what they got on Government \ncontracts, and they did not follow up on known problems. This was just \na report from last summer.\n  Other reports have found that the Pentagon pays too much for common \nitems and buys things we do not need, and on and on.\n  I believe we do have a serious problem in inventory control with the \nDepartment of Defense. I half facetiously, a year or two ago when I \noffered a similar amendment, said that the Government is now \ncontracting out a lot of functions, and the Bush administration seems \nto be intent on contracting out, that maybe what we really ought to do \nis contract out inventory control for the Department of Defense to Wal-\nmart. I can guarantee that Wal-Mart does not lose $1 billion a year in \ninventory. I guarantee when Wal-Mart orders items, they know if they \nhave been shipped and they know who gets it. I picked on Wal-Mart, but \nI could name another company. But my point is made.\n  We have a huge bureaucracy, the Department of Defense. They are \nbuying billions of dollars' worth of items with taxpayers' money, and \nin many cases they cannot account for it. We have the stockpiling of \nexcess items, and they keep right on buying items that they say they do \nnot even need.\n  Would someone please make sense of this to this Senator? Why is the \nDepartment of Defense ordering items that it has already said it does \nnot need, yet keeps the orders going? That is what my amendment is \nattempting to do.\n  Some of the past GAO reports have resulted in improvements. The Navy, \nfor example, claims to have accounted for $2.5 billion of inventory \ndiscrepancies. But I am sorry to say the recommendations are frequently \nnot followed. Just on inventory issues, the GAO has more than 30 open \nrecommendations on using accurate data, setting consistent procedures \nand following them, adopting commercial best\n\n[[Page S6817]]\n\npractices and modern inventory systems, taking timely actions, and many \nmore--30 open items the GAO has identified to which the Department of \nDefense simply is not paying attention.\n  My amendment also requires that the Department of Defense report to \nCongress on what the Department is doing to implement these open GAO \nrecommendations on defense inventory issues.\n  Again, this amendment is a modest step forward. It is needed because \nthe Department has either not been willing or not been able adequately \nto address, by itself, past findings by the GAO of serious waste. I \nhave chosen to address the single, narrow area of secondary inventory \nbecause that is the area where we have fresh information from the GAO, \ninformation with which DOD generally concurs.\n  Now, while $2 billion may not be a large amount compared to the $400 \nbillion authorized in this bill, it is still a lot of taxpayer money, \nand it is being wasted. We ought to stop it. That is what my amendment \nseeks to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, how much time is there on this amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty minutes, evenly divided.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, first I thank and commend the Senator \nfrom Iowa for this amendment. It is an amendment which raises a lot of \nvery significant issues about the Department of Defense inventory. It \nis a subject I had quite a bit to do with many years ago, particularly \nwhen we raised issues about the amount of the warehousing that exists \nin the Department of Defense, the amount of purchases which were made \nwhich contributed to that inventory, which was excessive.\n  We made some progress. This was a number of years ago, but \nnonetheless we made some progress. I think we actually reduced the \nnumber of warehouses at that time by about 40 percent. But it is \nobvious we still have a problem and we are going to have a greater \nproblem if we do not address it because of the increased size of the \nDefense budget and the purchases of the Defense Department.\n  The GAO has issued a report. It is a fairly new report. Frankly, we \nhave not had a chance to even analyze that report. Many years ago, when \nwe took up this subject and had hearings and made some progress on this \nissue, we had some differences with the GAO over their approach, over \nthe way in which they measured things. I don't know whether that is \nstill a problem because, again, we have just not had a chance to review \nthis report. It is very recent. We have not had a chance to meet with \nthe GAO or the Senator from Iowa and his staff.\n  If the Senator is willing, I would make a commitment--I know the \nchairman would join me in this commitment because I have spoken with \nthe chairman about this subject--to look into the GAO report and to do \nso promptly, to review it, and then to meet with the Senator from Iowa \nto review it and address those issues he thinks need to be addressed. \nWe will do that promptly. We are not trying to delay it because the \nSenator has pointed out matters which could save us significant amounts \nof money.\n  On the other hand, if we do it wrong, for instance, if we sell things \nwhich are excess to inventory which will not be excess a few months \nfrom now, if we bring the inventory down--for instance, if we have 2 \nyears of inventory for things we only need a year and a half of, we may \nnot want to sell that extra 6 months; we may want to bring the \ninventory down to a year and a half.\n  There are some complications. I have had a chance to talk with our \ndear friend from Iowa. His heart is absolutely in the right place. His \nhead is in the right place. His staff is in the right place. We want to \ntry to be in the right place with him and join him in this effort and \nhave the opportunity which I have just described to review this GAO \nreport with him and take the appropriate action.\n  I urge he consider allowing that course to occur and not to press his \namendment at this time. I know the chairman of the committee has some \nthoughts on the subject as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I associate myself with the remarks of \nmy colleague from Michigan.\n  I say to the Senator from Iowa, really, in a way we appreciate what \nyou have done because you have identified an issue that has been of \nconcern to our committee for some many years. The Armed Services \nCommittee has held hearings and sponsored much of the GAO's best-\npractices work. But there remain to be done some important aspects of \nthis problem.\n\n  DOD has made some progress but much more needs to be done. We \nrecognize that. I want to work with the Senator from Iowa and the \nSenator from Michigan and other members of the committee to address the \ninventory management problems at the Defense Department.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I thank both the chairman and the \nranking member for their attention, and their responses. I know the \nSenators and their staffs, on both sides, have worked on this matter \ngoing back some years. I appreciate that.\n  This seems like that whack-a-mole type thing; you keep hitting it and \nsomething else pops up. From our side, the Defense Appropriations \nSubcommittee side, I have been addressing this since 1995. GAO even \nsaid here:\n\n       Since 1995, we have reported on imbalances in DOD's \n     inventory, and our current work shows that these imbalances \n     continue to exist.\n\n  I know the chairman and ranking member have a lot on their plate. \nThis is a big bill. There is a lot you have to pay attention to. But \nsomehow we just have to get our hands on this.\n  In response to what Senator Levin had said, we found in one of our \nreports--I am sure the chairman is very familiar with it--where we had \nat one point 100 years or more of inventory of some items. Of course \nthey are going to be long obsolete before that hundred years is out.\n  Some of that has been taken care of. I compliment the chairman and \nranking member, now and in the past, for attending to that, because a \nlot of that has been reduced. I compliment you for that.\n  But we still have one problem here--well, one among others--of the \nsecondary inventory and the fact they keep buying, even though they \nthemselves say they do not need it.\n  So I appreciate what you said. I know you have not had a chance to \ntake a look at it. I look forward to my staff and your staff working \ntogether and maybe coming up with some things so we can get them moving \nin the right direction.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, if I might say to my colleague, on a \npersonal note, he and I have reminisced many times how we have been \nprivileged to wear the uniform of our country. I am struck by the \nhundred years. That parallels the commode scene we had hear some years \nago, if the Senator remembers.\n  People operating in the Department of Defense have good intentions, \nbe they in uniform or civilians. It is their country and their \ntaxpayers' money. What we have to do is provide them with the proper \ndirection when they need it to try to correct these things. But we have \nalways, being military persons ourselves, to remember readiness is \nforemost. We have to err sometimes on the side of caution to maintain \nthe readiness needed, particularly in today's environment, where unlike \nwhen you and I served there was time to get ready for military \noperations.\n  World War II basically took a year to get cranked up and going. We \ndon't have that time anymore with these modern weapons and terrorism \nand the like. We have to be ready because what is on the shelf and what \nis in inventory is about all the men and women in the Armed Forces have \nwhen they have to move out with such swiftness now to address the \nthreats of today.\n\n  I thank the Senator, but I just wanted to bring up that one note.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I appreciate my friend from Virginia mentioning that. \nThat is true. That is why I understand we have to have some of this \ninventory. You are right, we should err on the side of caution in this \narea. But with the tremendous buildup we have and the amount\n\n[[Page S6818]]\n\nof money we are talking about here, let's face it, big mistakes can be \nmade and things can happen.\n  I went back one time and I read a lot about the old Truman Commission \nin World War II that was set up. Here we were, World War II, and we had \nto respond, as the Senator knows, rapidly at that time. We had to go \nalmost from nothing to build up an Air Force and a Navy and an Army. \nThe enemy was at our gates. But at the same time, the Senate set up a \nspecial Committee then under Senator Harry Truman of Missouri. That \ncommission did a number of things. Some people went to jail. Some \npeople paid fines. They saved the taxpayers literally--I don't know if \nit was billions, at least hundreds of millions of dollars at that time, \nwhich would translate into billions at today's inflated levels. They \ndid that in the midst of the Second World War.\n  I am just saying we need some more oversight, and we need some better \naccounting practices and inventory control systems.\n  Maybe the chairman did not hear me when I said earlier, half \nfacetiously, a couple years ago maybe that when we are contracting out \nwe ought to contract out inventory control to Wal-Mart. They don't lose \nmuch. They keep track of everything. As the chairman knows, there are \nsome new technologies out there that are coming on line that will allow \nus to track----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Iowa has expired.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask unanimous consent for a couple more minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. There is no objection on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Maybe some of this new technology would be what would \nhelp us get more control.\n  I thank the chairman.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 774 Withdrawn\n\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment. I \nlook forward to working with the chairman and ranking member to try to \nget a better handle on this.\n  Mr. WARNER. We thank our colleague very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is withdrawn.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, parliamentary inquiry: My understanding \nis that the Bingaman amendment is the order at this point in time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the next amendment to be considered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Could that temporarily be set aside for 5 minutes so the \nSenator may be recognized and then we will return to that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, I thank the distinguished chairman and \nmy friends on the Democratic side for allowing me to make this \npresentation.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 776\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. Bennett], for himself, Mr. Reid, \n     and Mr. Allen, proposes an amendment numbered 776.\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To repeal the MTOPS requirement for computer export controls)\n\n       At the end of subtitle D of title X, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1039. REPEAL OF MTOPS REQUIREMENT FOR COMPUTER EXPORT \n                   CONTROLS.\n\n       (a) Repeal.--Subtitle B of title XII of, and section 3157 \n     of, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n     1998 (50 U.S.C. App. 2404 note) are repealed.\n       (b) Consultation Required.--Before implementing any \n     regulations relating to an export administration system for \n     high-performance computers, the President shall consult with \n     the following congressional committees:\n       (1) The Select Committee on Homeland Security, the \n     Committee on Armed Services, and the Committee on \n     International Relations of the House of Representatives.\n       (2) The Committee on Armed Services, the Committee on \n     Foreign Relations, and the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \n     Urban Affairs of the Senate.\n       (c) Report.--Not later than 30 days after implementing any \n     regulations described in subsection (b), the President shall \n     submit to Congress a report that--\n       (1) identifies the functions of the Secretary of Commerce, \n     Secretary of Defense, Secretary of Energy, Secretary of \n     State, Secretary of Homeland Security, and any other relevant \n     national security or intelligence agencies under the export \n     administration system embraced by those regulations; and\n       (2) explains how the export administration system will \n     effectively advance the national security objectives of the \n     United States.\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, this amendment deals with the subject \nwhich I have dealt with before. It has to do with the National Defense \nAuthorization Act which requires the President to use as a measure for \ncomputer performance in setting export control thresholds a measurement \nknown as MTOPS, which stands for millions of theoretical operations per \nsecond.\n  The interesting thing about MTOPS is that, like Topsy, which sounds \nlike they are named after, they are constantly growing, and the level \nof MTOPS keeps growing from 4,000 to 8,000 to 16,000 to 56,000, and on \nand on. Every time we set an MTOPS level as saying we can control the \nexportation of supercomputers by insisting that this level not be \nexceeded, technology catches up. Quite literally, the last time we \ndealt with this, someone could go down to Toys-R-Us and buy a Sony \nPlayStation and have a device with more MTOPS in it than we were \nallowing to be exported in the name of protecting supercomputers from \nfalling into improper hands.\n  This matter has been discussed at some length. It has been decided \nand confirmed by the GAO that the use of MTOPS as the measure for \ncontrolling exports in this area is not productive and that MTOPS no \nlonger presents any kind of logical measure of what has happened. \nNonetheless, it is written into the law that MTOPS should remain as our \npresent measure.\n  My amendment would repeal that requirement in the law. It is \nsupported by virtually everyone who understands the reality of where we \nare in the high-tech industry.\n  I would go on to debate the amendment at greater length and outline \nits need, but I understand from conversations with the chairman's staff \nand with the Parliamentarian that this amendment would not be \nconsidered relevant to this bill at this time. For that reason, I will \nwithdraw the amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate very much the Senator offering this amendment. \nHe and I have worked on this matter through several Congresses. It is \nan extremely important amendment. It is unfortunate that it is not \ngoing to be relevant to this matter. I hope there is some way during \nthis Congress that we can expedite this most important amendment which \nthe Senator is talking about.\n  Talking about job creation, this is a way to create jobs--get rid of \nthis arbitrary rule that at one time may have had a little bit of \nreason but now has absolutely no reason to be on the statutes of this \ncountry.\n  Our current MTOPS metric measure which is used to regulate the export \nof U.S.-made technology hardware is outdated, hurts our high-technology \nindustry, and should be better crafted to address our Nation's specific \nsecurity concerns.\n  If U.S. companies are to effectively compete outside the United \nStates in foreign markets, the current MTOPS metric measure must be \nrepealed.\n  Once repealed, the current MTOPS measure will remain applicable to \nall export controls until the President, after consultation with the \nCommittee on Armed Services, the Committee on Foreign Relations, and \nthe Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate has \ntaken into consideration all relevant and necessary security concerns \nto ensure that U.S.-developed technology cannot be abused for the \npurposes of tyranny and terrorism.\n\n[[Page S6819]]\n\n  The President shall also consult with the Secretary of Commerce, \nSecretary of Defense, Secretary of Energy, Secretary of State, \nSecretary of Homeland Security, and any other relevant national \nsecurity or intelligence agency under the export administration system \naffected by the MTOPS provisions.\n  We must act now to protect our status as world leaders in technology \ndevelopment.\n  In the interests of national security and economic productivity, we \nmust clear a path to reform the current MTOPS metric measure that is \nunnecessarily restraining our high-technology industry.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 776 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, I thank my friend from Nevada. I will \ntell him, there is a way this can be done this Congress. It is my \nunderstanding an attempt will be made in the House to place this \namendment in the bill in the House where it does not run into the \nrelevancy difficulty I ran into here today.\n  I would hope our chairman and ranking member, when they get to \nconference, if they find the language in the bill, would feel so \ndisposed to accept it as it becomes a conferenceable item.\n  Madam President, I withdraw my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is withdrawn.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 765\n\n (Purpose: To require a specific authorization of Congress before the \n   conduct of the design, development, or deployment of hit-to-kill \n                ballistic missile defense interceptors)\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I call up amendment No. 765 and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman] for himself, Mr. \n     Dorgan, Mr. Reed, and Mr. Biden, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 765:\n       At the end of subtitle C of title II, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 225. REQUIREMENT FOR SPECIFIC AUTHORIZATION OF CONGRESS \n                   FOR DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT, OR DEPLOYMENT OF HIT-\n                   TO-KILL BALLISTIC MISSILE INTERCEPTORS.\n\n       No amount authorized to be appropriated by this Act or any \n     other Act for research, development, test, and evaluation, \n     Defense-wide, and available for Ballistic Missile Defense \n     Systems Interceptors (PE 060886C), may be obligated or \n     expended to design, develop, or deploy hit-to-kill \n     interceptors or other weapons for placement in space unless \n     specifically authorized by Congress.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I offer this amendment on behalf of \nmyself, Senator Dorgan, Senator Reed, and Senator Biden. This is an \namendment I hope can be approved to clarify that this Congress, this \nSenate, does not intend to be authorizing--by this bill, the language \nwe have before us here in the legislation--does not intend to be \nauthorizing the weaponization of space.\n  The amendment proposes to require specific authorization from \nCongress if we are going to proceed to design or develop or deploy hit-\nto-kill interceptors or other weapons we intend to have placed in \nspace.\n  This is an issue that has not had a great deal of debate in the \nSenate in recent years. In fact, I think we discussed it some when the \nformer President Bush--not this President Bush, but the former \nPresident Bush--had his proposal for the program called Brilliant \nPebbles. But there has not been a lot of discussion in the last few \nyears. I do not believe this issue was addressed, either, in the markup \nof the Defense authorization bill in the Armed Services Committee. In \nmy view, it is a very important issue.\n  Specifically, within this program there is a new start for fiscal \nyear 2004 that is titled: ``Space-Based Interceptor Test Bed.'' This \nprogram proposes to develop a test bed in outer space consisting of \nseveral satellites that would deploy kinetic energy rounds to strike \nmissiles in their boost phase. They also, of course, could be used to \nstrike satellites as well.\n  I have great concern with this whole proposal. As all colleagues \nknow, as a nation this President chose to withdraw from the ABM treaty. \nNow, the ABM treaty did contain a prohibition against deploying \nantiballistic missile systems in space. As I see this new start that is \nin the bill the administration has proposed to the Congress, we really \nare seeing here a follow-on to our decision to withdraw from the ABM \ntreaty. In my view, it sends a very unfortunate signal to other \ncountries--to China, to Russia, to North Korea, to other countries--\nthat might have capability to follow our lead.\n  It essentially sends them the signal that we are beginning the \nprocess of weaponizing space. This is not a signal I think this \nCongress or this administration should be sending.\n  I note we have a longstanding policy, a policy that has been in place \nsince President Eisenhower was in the White House, not to put weapons \nin space. There is a crucial distinction I want to make here between \nusing space for military purposes and actually putting weapons in \nspace. We do use space for military purposes. We use space for \nreconnaissance. We use space to gather information in a great variety \nof ways to support our defense needs. But we have never stepped over \nthe threshold and actually put weapons in space. I think for us to \nchoose to do so is a very important decision which should not be taken \nlightly and should not be taken without great care.\n  This program that is in the bill contains a seed element which I \nthink should concern all Members. Under the Department of Defense so-\ncalled Spiral Development Policy, initial test beds--which is what this \nprovision calls for--but initial test beds, such as the ground-based \ntest bed at Fort Greely, are seen as being used simultaneously, at \nleast for partial deployment of systems. It is my fear a similar result \ncould happen with regard to this space-based test bed; that is, the \ninitial fielded satellites would be converted, like the ground system \nat Fort Greely, to a fielded weapons system in space.\n\n  For that reason, I think it is important we make clear--we in the \nCongress make clear--we do not want that to happen, we do not want \nfunds in this bill used for design and development and deployment of \nweapons in space unless Congress focuses on the issue and actually \nauthorizes that action to take place.\n  There is a great deal I could point to here that elaborates on what I \nhave been saying. I think the main point I want to make, again, is I do \nnot believe most Americans support the notion that the United States \nshould become the first country to deploy weapons in space. I do not \nthink a military need has been demonstrated. In particular, I do not \nthink the administration and the Congress should do so without a \nthorough discussion and debate about the issue, so that we, in fact, \nknow what we are doing and the implications of what we are doing.\n  This is a very large step for us to take, to become the first nation \nto proceed to put weapons in space, and I do not think this is \nsomething that should be done lightly. This decision is one I think we \nwill hear about for a very long time, and I think it will have \nrepercussions for a very long time. I think this amendment I have \nproposed tries to make it clear we do not want to make that decision \ntoday, that the Congress has not debated this adequately, that the \nArmed Services Committee has not debated this adequately, and we are \nnot prepared today to authorize--or at least we have not as yet, in my \nview, taken the step of specifically authorizing the design and \ndevelopment and deployment of weapons in space.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). Eight minutes remain.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me just talk about one other aspect. \nThe Pentagon's Missile Defense Agency, which oversees missile defense \nresearch and development, did an interview in February talking about \ntheir so-called space-based test bed, which is what I am addressing my \namendment to here.\n  The thrust of what they described in that interview was they intend \nto field satellites armed with multiple hit-to-kill interceptors that \nare capable of destroying a ballistic missile through a high-speed \ncollision shortly after it is launched.\n  This might be something we decide we have to do, but, to my \nknowledge, that debate has not occurred in Congress, and I do not want \nto see us proceeding down that road without the Congress having focused \non it, having actually specifically authorized it.\n\n[[Page S6820]]\n\nTherefore, my amendment tries to clarify that is, in fact, what is \nrequired before we can proceed down that road.\n  There is funding also in this same program element, and that is the \nPE 060886C. There is funding in there for the ground-based \ninterceptors, for their development.\n  Certainly that is a decision we have made as a country, and I am not \ntrying to revisit that. I do think we go a substantial additional step \nwhen we decide we are also going to be designing, developing, and \ndeploying weapons in space. We will do so. We will begin that process \nby setting up this so-called test bed in space. Those satellites will \nbe the beginning of that process.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. It is my understanding I have 15 minutes under my \ncontrol.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. I wonder if I may ask my colleague a question or two. For \nmany years you served on the Armed Services Committee. You have a \ncomplete familiarity as to how we address issues. My recollection--and \nI don't think it is to be disputed--of the markup in the subcommittee \nis, when we looked at this line of funding, no one on your side of the \naisle or anyone else raised an issue. We went to full markup, and no \none raised an issue about it.\n  Essentially you are coming in, which you have a perfect right to do, \nbut you are coming in to kill a program. Am I not correct, this \namendment kills the program?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Let me respond that I am certainly not trying to kill \nthe development of any of the program that is ground based. I am \nsaying, however, that we should not proceed to establish, to design, \ndevelop, and deploy a space-based weapons capability absent some debate \nabout it.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, that is quite clear.\n  Is the answer to my question, yes, you are trying to kill the \ninitiation of an element that could lead to space-based weapons? Isn't \nthat correct?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. That is correct. I think that should not be done \nwithout much more deliberation than we have given it.\n  Mr. WARNER. I just point out that on your side of the aisle, \nparticipating actively in markup in the full committee, there was no \neffort to examine it.\n  The next question I ask my colleague: Are you aware how much money \nthe taxpayers of this Nation put in previous programs for space-based \nweaponry prior to when President Clinton--I don't say this in a \ncritical way; it is just a fact way--determined that we would not put \nanother dollar in space based?\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, in response to my colleague's question, \nI am aware that we put substantial funding in and most of that funding \nwas for research.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. There is nothing in my amendment that would interfere \nwith research. What I am trying to head off is the actual design and \ndevelopment and deployment of space-based weapons as part of this new \nprogram start. But research has proceeded. We have funded it at a high \nlevel. I have supported that.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator is on my time, and he is kind of getting into \nit a little bit. I need a few minutes here.\n  We spent, as a nation, $1.8 billion on space-based intercepts from \n1985 to 1993. This is for $14 million to go in and take a look at what \nhas taken place in years prior thereto, by virtue of an expenditure of \n$1.8 billion, to determine the feasibility of whether this concept \nshould be resumed. Essentially you are stopping us from even taking a \nlook at this enormous investment which has been expended to determine \nwhether we should once again begin in a substantial way to look at \nspace-based interceptors. That is what is before the Senate, $14 \nmillion to go back and look at a program of $1.8 billion. It is for \nthat reason that we vigorously oppose the amendment.\n  I yield the floor at this time. I see the chairman of the \nsubcommittee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEVIN. How much time does each side have?\n  Mr. WARNER. Each side had 15 minutes. I am not sure for which side \nthe distinguished ranking member is speaking.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sponsor has 5 minutes 43 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. LEVIN. How much time does the sponsor have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes 43 seconds.\n  Mr. LEVIN. And the opposition?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten and a half minutes.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. WARNER. I think it is important that we hear from the ranking \nmember because I have asked a question. We did not address this at all \nin the subcommittee or full committee markup. I presumed, since it was \nin our bill--I say respectfully to my colleague--I believe he was here \nto support the bill as written. I come at somewhat of a surprise now on \nexactly where my distinguished colleague from Michigan is on this \namendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Well, I certainly am not committed to the bill as written \nbecause there are a number of provisions in the bill that I opposed in \ncommittee and that I have opposed on the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. But there was no opposition in the course of the markup, \neither in subcommittee or full committee.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The chairman is correct. This issue was not brought to my \nattention until the floor. But there are a number of issues which are \nbrought to our attention for the first time on the floor. I hope any of \nus can support those issues when they are brought to the floor. We \nought to all feel free to do that.\n  Mr. WARNER. I will save this debate for another day.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time to the Senator from Colorado?\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, as chairman of the Strategic Subcommittee, \nthis is an issue on which we have held discussions. We have put \ntogether the provisions that deal with many of the modernization \nelements of the defense and Armed Forces of the country. This is an \namendment that did not get brought forward during deliberation in the \nsubcommittee, nor deliberation in the Armed Services Committee, as far \nas I recall.\n  I am concerned about continued efforts on the floor of the Senate to \nstymie our reaching out to new technology. We have had an amendment \nconcerning low-yield nuclear weapons that allows for a study to think \nabout what our alternatives might be. We have had amendments here \nconcerning robust nuclear earth penetrators, just to study the concept.\n  Here is another concept that the committee has decided we should \nstudy. It seems to me that in a modern military, these are things we \nshould be looking at. Things are changing.\n  I commend the President's Secretary of Defense. He is trying to \nmodernize our military forces, get them to work together on the \nbattlefield more than we ever had before. We saw that happen in Iraq. \nThese are all issues that are part of a joint force effort.\n  I hope we can defeat the amendment. I oppose the Bingaman amendment. \nAgain, it prohibits us even taking the time to study the concept. After \nyou do the study, you list the pros and cons and then decide if this is \nsomething you want to move forward, whether it is feasible. We need to \ngather facts on actual costs. We may decide, after doing the study, \nthat it is too expensive. On the other hand, we may do the study and \nlook at the threats facing the country and say: This is something we \nneed to be doing.\n  It is foolhardy that we have amendments that continually keep coming \nup that don't allow us to study our alternatives. We need to have the \nstudies. We need to be thinking about what kind of threats and what we \nwant the military to look like 10, 20, 30 years down the road.\n  I hope other Members of the Senate will join me in opposing this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n\n[[Page S6821]]\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wonder if I can get the attention of the \nSenator from New Mexico, and Senator Allard as well. I ask the Senator \nfrom New Mexico to yield me 1 minute.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I yield to the Senator as much time as he needs.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senator from----\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, just a minute. In a conscientious effort \nto resolve this, I ask unanimous consent that each side be given \nanother 5 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senator from Virginia and the Senator from Colorado \nhave raised a point that there has been a significant amount of money \nthat has been invested in this item, and there should not be a \nprohibition on reviewing the work, studying the work, on doing research \nin this area. As I understand the language in the amendment of the \nSenator from New Mexico, it is not intended to prevent studies or, \nindeed, research. It is intended to say that before you get to the \ndesign stage, which is beyond research and beyond studies, you come \nback for specific authorization.\n  So the point being made is, if the Senator from New Mexico is not \nintending to prevent a review of all the work, which was done \napparently in the 1980s, and is not intending to prevent studies or \neven research under 6.0, 6.1, and 6.2, I wonder whether the Senator \nfrom New Mexico would be willing to make that clear and explicit in \nthat amendment, if that addresses satisfactorily the issue raised by \nthe Senator from Virginia.\n  I have just talked to the Senator from New Mexico. There is no intent \nin the language to prevent a study of previous work. All this language \nsays is that before you begin the design stage--that is beyond pure \nresearch--before you begin the design and development stage, come back \nand get specific authority. I don't think that is what is intended to \nbe done with this money this year, from what the chairman and Senator \nAllard have said.\n  So I ask the question of the Senator from New Mexico whether the \nSenator would be willing to add language to his amendment that nothing \nin here is intended to prevent the study of the hit-to-kill capability, \nor previous analyses, or research prior to the design stage?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, in response to my colleague's question, \nI think it is very clear what my amendment is trying to do, that the \nDepartment of Defense cannot obligate or expend funds to design, \ndevelop, or deploy hit-to-kill interceptors or other weapons for \nplacement in space, unless they get specific authorization.\n  So if they want to do more research or go back and look at previously \nperformed research or analyses, certainly I have no problem with that. \nI think that is----\n  Mr. WARNER. I draw the Senator's attention to the first words:\n\n       No amount authorized to be appropriated by this Act for \n     research. . . .\n\n  It is right in there.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I think the operative language is on page 2, where I \nsay what this sentence is intended to mean: that no amount authorized \nto be appropriated by this act for research, development, test, and \nevaluation may be expended for design, development, or the deployment \nof these types of weapons in space.\n\n  I think I have made it very clear we are trying to head off the use \nof funds for designing weapons in space until Congress has a chance to \ndebate this issue and until there is a specific authorization required.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I think there is some expression by our \ncolleague to amend the amendment. I take that in good faith. I believe \nwe need a little time to examine this proposal. The chairman of the \nsubcommittee, the Senator from Colorado, is prepared to sit down with \nthe Senator and see what we might be able to do to bridge the gap \nbecause this is essentially another vote, as it is now written, to stop \nthe program cold, to put in a ban. We have been through a series of \nvotes on that now and, thus far, we have prevailed to not let bans be \nput in place, and here is another one coming up.\n  So, in good faith, we will take a look at such amendments that the \nSenator may wish. Therefore, I simply ask unanimous consent that this \namendment be laid aside for a period of time.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Prior to that, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nRhode Island. He has been waiting to speak on this general issue, if \nthat is possible.\n  Mr. WARNER. We have no objection if the Senator takes some time to \nspeak.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. We can postpone a vote until we visit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I want to underscore the major issue that \nthe Senator from New Mexico is raising and that is the weaponization of \nspace. We have talked today earlier about different nuclear programs \nand should we have low-yield weapons bans or robust nuclear earth \npenetrator bans. But the realm of nuclear weaponry has been upon us now \nfor five decades.\n  To date, we have been successful in preventing weapons from being \ndeployed in space. So this is a completely different issue. This is not \nthe issue of shall we do more of what we have been doing for 50 years. \nThis is a threshold question: Do we want to introduce weapons into \nspace? And will this introduction come surreptitiously, innocuously by \nresearch programs that put weapons in space for a test bed without \ndebate in the U.S. Congress on behalf of the American people and a \nclear decision?\n  I think that is the Senator's amendment. He has identified \nprogrammatic funding that could be stretched to inch our way--perhaps \nthrough the back door, if you will--into placing weapons in space. I \nthink that is such a critical and important issue that we not only have \nto debate it but we should decide it, not scientists and technologists \nin the Department of Defense. I cannot think of any scientist who would \nnot like more permission to study more things.\n  So I urge, hopefully, the resolution of this amendment. If it is not \nresolved and comes to a vote, I hope we can support the Senator from \nNew Mexico.\n  I yield back my time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have spoken to the two managers of the \nbill. They are both in agreement that we could set aside the Bingaman \namendment and move to the next amendment which would be offered, and \nthat is by Senator Dayton. Senator Dayton is offering an amendment on \nbuy America. He has agreed to 30 minutes equally divided. We would, of \ncourse, have the normal agreement that no second-degree amendments will \nbe offered.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that we set aside Bingaman and move now to \nthe Dayton amendment, and that no second-degree amendments be in order \nprior to the vote on the matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. It would be in the usual form in relation to any language \nthat might be stricken.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 725\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 725.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota (Mr. Dayton), for himself, and \n     Mr. Feingold, proposes an amendment No. 725.\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To strike section 833, relating to waiver authority for \n                domestic source or content requirements)\n\n       Strike section 833.\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Wisconsin, \nMr. Feingold, be added as a cosponsor to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S6822]]\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator from Minnesota yield?\n  Mr. DAYTON. I yield.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senator Warner, who has been so heavily \nengaged in this legislation, allowed me to go forward with a unanimous \nconsent request. However, it was brought to our attention that there is \na Senator who wishes to offer a second-degree amendment, or might want \nto offer a second-degree amendment to this matter. I have consent that \nwe go forward with the Dayton amendment but we would remove the time \nagreement.\n  Mr. WARNER. And recognize that there could be a second degree.\n  Mr. REID. That is right. If that does not come to be, we will worry \nabout a time agreement at a subsequent time. The agreement is we are \nsetting aside Bingaman and moving to Dayton.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate the cooperation of the Senator \nfrom Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I know the Senator from Virginia and the Senator from \nNevada are working together on this and I am in good hands.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I call up this amendment and point out \nthat at a time when millions of Americans are unemployed, looking for \njobs, unable to find jobs, and are suffering terrible emotional and \nfinancial hardships as a result, it is astonishing to me that the \nadministration would seek in this bill to move more American jobs to \nother countries. It is astonishing, but given this administration, it \nis not surprising. It is well on its way to becoming the most anti-jobs \nadministration in our Nation's history.\n  Since President Bush took office 2\\1/2\\ years ago, 2.7 million jobs \nhave been lost throughout the United States of America. In the first 3 \nmonths of this year alone, 500,000 jobs disappeared. The only idea for \neconomic stimulus that the administration has is to cut taxes for the \nAmericans who are already rich, whether they work or not.\n  In this bill, the administration wants to gut the ``buy American,'' \nwhich is an existing law passed by the Congress in 1933, which for the \nlast 70 years, under Republican administrations, Democratic \nadministrations, has been a policy of this Congress--that we will \nattempt to buy American.\n  The Berry amendment was enacted in 1941, at the onset of World War \nII, applying specifically to the Department of Defense procurements. It \nsays, in pertinent part:\n\n       Provided: That no part of this or any other appropriation \n     contained in this Act shall be available for the procurement \n     of any article of food or clothing not grown or produced in \n     the United States or its possessions, except to the extent \n     that the head of the department concerned shall determine \n     that articles of food or clothing grown or produced in the \n     United States or its possessions cannot be procured of \n     satisfactory quality and in sufficient quantities and at \n     reasonable prices as when needed. . . .\n\n  That is not unreasonable. That is not onerous. It says you must buy \nproducts grown or made or manufactured in the United States except when \nthe Secretary of Defense will determine, on his sole authority, that it \ncannot be procured of satisfactory quality or sufficient times at \nreasonable prices as and when needed. That is not even a ``buy \nAmerican'' requirement but ``try to buy American'' requirement, try to \nbuy American products.\n  This administration does not even want to try. They added into this \ncommittee bill section 833 which, in pertinent part, says:\n\n       Waiver of domestic source or content requirements\n       (a) Authority--Except as provided in subsection (f), the \n     Secretary of Defense may waive the application of any \n     domestic source requirement or domestic content requirement \n     referred to in subsection (b) and thereabout authorize the \n     procurement of items that are grown, reprocessed, reused, \n     produced, or manufactured--\n       (1) in a foreign country that has a reciprocal defense \n     procurement memorandum or agreement with the United States.\n\n  That is 21 foreign countries. And it is not even so important that \nthe Secretary himself or herself has to make that determination.\n  It grants later that:\n\n       (A) may not be delegated to any officer or employee other \n     than the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition \n     Technology and Logistics.\n\n  If this bill passes with the current language, there will be 21 other \ncountries around the world which can be given equal priority as the \nUnited States of America for contracts that provide jobs which are \nbeing paid for by American tax dollars. Those dollars had been \nappropriated and they will be spent on the U.S. Armed Forces, to clothe \nthem, feed them, and equip them with the best, which is what they \ndeserve because they are the best young men and women in the world and \nthey proved their courage, their valor, and skills once again in Iraq, \nas they have before so many times and as they will probably be called \nupon to do again. They deserve the best. They should get the best. \nCongress has made clear in existing law that they will get the best and \nthey will get it when they need it.\n  Current law says whenever it is reasonably possible, however, to \nsupply those needs with goods and products and equipment that are \nproduced in this country, using materials that are made, where \nfeasible, in this country, then do so, recognizing that will provide an \nadditional public benefit for those expenditures of tax dollars of \ncreating or saving jobs for Americans. If it is not reasonably \npossible, the law says, then don't, but at least try to buy American. \nAt least try to spend public funds in the United States rather than in \nother countries. At least try to benefit the U.S. economy rather than \nanother nation. At least care enough to try.\n  For 70 years, every administration has been willing to make that \neffort. But not this administration, evidently, because at their \nrequest the language was inserted that says the Department of Defense \ndoes not even have to try; they can buy in the United States or they \ncan buy in 21 other foreign countries, and the Secretary of Defense \ndoes not even need to be bothered with those decisions. They evidently \ndo not consider it important enough to require him to do so. An Under \nSecretary can handle it. These are decisions that will decide whether \nsome Americans keep their jobs and get new jobs. And they say it is not \nthat important.\n  My colleagues, that is the question before the Senate today. Should \nwe just give up at this point in time, right now especially, a 70-year \npolicy that creates or saves American jobs for American citizens, when \nit is reasonably possible to do so? Or, no, no, it just really does not \nmatter?\n  It matters a great deal to millions of Americans who are looking for \nwork today. It matters a great deal to their husbands and their wives \nand their children. It matters a great deal to me, which is why I \nbrought this amendment forward. If it matters to the Senate today, \nMembers will support my amendment. I urge my colleagues to do so.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I commend President Bush for his \nleadership in invigorating our Nation's missile defense programs. Just \nyesterday, the President publicly released his vision and guidance to \nprovide for a ballistic missile defense system. National Security \nPolicy Directive 23 formalizes the administration's missile defense \npolicy, and it is consistent with the National Missile Defense Act of \n1999, which is now Public Law 106-38. It was adopted during the 106th \nCongress.\n  The National Missile Defense Act stated:\n\n       It is the policy of the United States to deploy as soon as \n     is technologically possible an effective National Missile \n     Defense system capable of defending the territory of the \n     United States against limited ballistic missile attack \n     (whether accidental, unauthorized, or deliberate) with \n     funding subject to the annual authorization of appropriation \n     and the annual appropriation of funds for National Missile \n     Defense.\n\n  With the President's leadership, our Nation is now moving forward to \nprovide the most technologically feasible defenses as soon as possible.\n  I commend the chairman of the Armed Services Committee and those who \nhave worked with him to craft this authorization bill. It carries \nforward and builds upon the need for testing,\n\n[[Page S6823]]\n\ndevelopment, and deployment of adequate missile defense systems to \nprotect not only our homeland but our forces in the field and our \ninterests around the world.\n  Today, I am pleased to report that our national resolve and \ntechnological superiority are being brought to bear in ways not \npossible under the restrictions of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.\n  For the first time, our missile defense research and development \nefforts are being integrated at all levels. As a result, our Nation \nwill benefit from deployed missile defense capabilities, while we \ncontinue to test and field technologies in logical increments.\n  We are moving forward with one integrated program consisting of \nseveral elements rather than separate programs linked in name only. In \nshort, the evolutionary and integrated approach to research and \ndevelopment will allow defensive capabilities to be fielded years \nbefore they otherwise might have.\n  Systems we are pursuing are capable of intercepting missiles \nthroughout the predicted flight path of various types of ballistic \nmissiles. The threat of these missiles to our Nation, to our deployed \nArmed Forces, and to our allies exists today. It is prudent to continue \nwith the immediate testing and fielding of the variety of systems \nneeded to counter these challenging threats.\n  Testing to date has proven to be increasingly promising. Next year, \nground-based interceptors in Alaska and California will be activated \nand will serve as a foundation upon which continental defenses may \nlater be expanded. Testing locations along a Pacific test-bed will \nallow for near-term defense against rogue threats.\n  We will continue to develop and test incrementally. The plan is to \nfield systems as we go and build upon capabilities as they are tested \nand proven.\n  Ground- and sea-based interceptors, additional Patriot, PAC-3, units, \nand sensors based on land, at sea, and in space are planned for \noperational use in 2004 and 2005. We will work with our allies to \nupgrade key early-warning radars to help enhance capabilities.\n  Equally promising systems will be deployable much sooner, due to the \nadministration's incorporation of an aggressive research, development, \nand testing regimen.\n  In developing defensive capabilities along the land, sea, air, and \nspace spectrum, our missile defense system will help protect our \nhomeland and international interests, as well as contribute to the \ndefense of our Allies.\n  The President has made clear that defending the American people \nagainst the threats to our homeland and our sovereignty is the \nadministration's highest priority. I commend the President for this \nleadership.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. COLLINS). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, what is the business before the \nSenate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is the Dayton amendment.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be set aside \nand that we return to the amendment I offered, No. 765.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object, how long will it take?\n  Mr. ALLARD. About 2 minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I do not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 765, As Modified\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I send a modification of the amendment \nto the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has the right to modify his own \namendment. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n       At the end of subtitle C of title II, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 225. REQUIREMENT FOR SPECIFIC AUTHORIZATION OF CONGRESS \n                   FOR DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT, OR DEPLOYMENT OF HIT-\n                   TO-KILL BALLISTIC MISSILE INTERCEPTORS.\n\n         (a) No amount authorized to be appropriated by this Act \n     for research, development, test, and evaluation, Defense-\n     wide, and available for Ballistic Missile Defense System \n     Interceptors (PE 060886C), may be obligated or expended to \n     design, develop, or deploy hit-to-kill interceptors or other \n     weapons for placement in space unless specifically authorized \n     by Congress.\n       (b) Of the amounts authorized to be appropriated for fiscal \n     year 2004 for Ballistic Missile Defense System Interceptors, \n     $14,000,000 is available for research and concept definition \n     for the space based test bed.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, let me explain to my colleagues what \nwe have done, both working with Senator Levin and Senator Allard and \nSenator Warner and the various staff who have worked on this issue.\n  First, let me describe very briefly what my amendment does. The \nlanguage of the amendment I offered originally was fairly clear in that \nwe were trying to restrict the use of funds in a particular program \nelement so that they could not be used, obligated, or expended to \ndesign, develop, or deploy hit-to-kill interceptors or other weapons \nfor placement in space unless there was specific authorization by \nCongress. That is an important provision to try to get into the law. \nAnd in order to do that, I have agreed to a modification of that which \nSenator Allard recommended.\n  That modification would add a subsection (b) that would say:\n\n       Of the amounts authorized to be appropriated for fiscal \n     year 2004 for Ballistic Missile Defense System Interceptors, \n     $14,000,000 is available for research and concept definition \n     for the space based test bed.\n\n  As I see the effect of this modified amendment, the general provision \nwould be agreed to that there cannot be funds used for either design or \ndevelopment or deployment of these weapons in space out of these funds, \nwith the only exception being that $14 million is available for \nresearch and concept definition with regard to this space-based test \nbed. That is an acceptable alteration and one that still keeps intact \nthe basic provision I intended with my amendment. On that basis, I have \nagreed to modify it.\n  I yield to Senator Allard. I know he wants to describe the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. First, I thank the sponsor of the amendment, Senator \nBingaman, for working in this compromise language. We do maintain, out \nof the ballistic missile defense system interceptors account, we have \nthe $14 million kept available for research and concept definition for \nthe space-based test bed. I thank Senator Levin and his contribution to \nhelp us work out the compromise, as well as the chairman, Senator \nWarner.\n  I am prepared to yield back the remainder of my time. The other side \nis prepared to yield back the remainder of their time. Then we are \nready to voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 765, as \nmodified.\n  The amendment (No. 765), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 783 To Amendment No. 725\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I send a second-degree amendment to the \ndesk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 783 to the language proposed to be stricken by \n     amendment No. 725.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To propose the insertion of matter in lieu of the matter \n                        proposed to be stricken)\n\n       In lieu of the matter proposed to be stricken, insert the \n     following:\n\n[[Page S6824]]\n\n     SEC. 833.

Waiver of domestic source or content requirements.''.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, this amendment narrows the numbers of \ncountries to six that would be eligible under the provisions of the \nbill and would modify the pending amendment to remove the restrictions \nthat would be imposed by the pending amendment at least in the case of \nsix nations which are our closest allies.\n  Last week we passed an AIDS bill through the Senate, and there were \nnumerous amendments. One of them was a very interesting amendment \nbecause it basically protected an industry in the United States of \nAmerica, thereby causing AIDS drugs to be only available at much higher \nprices, which then had the obvious effect of reducing the number of \npeople who will be treated for AIDS. I forget the vote. I think it was \n54 something to 40 something.\n  By protecting a major American industry, the pharmaceutical \nindustry--in the estimates of some--hundreds of thousands if not \nmillions of people will not be able to obtain a cure for AIDS because \nthe drug money is obviously finite.\n  I was embarrassed by that. I think the Senator from Minnesota voted \nwith the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, in his amendment of \nwhich I was a cosponsor. Basically what we are doing now is to set up \nprotection for other industries--primarily, the defense industries in \nthe United States--by prohibiting the United States from purchasing \nmilitary equipment that is manufactured in other countries which is the \neffect of the Dayton amendment. It is rather remarkable because we just \ncame out of a conflict from which we suffered Americans dead and \nwounded. One would think that the priority should be not where the \nequipment is manufactured, whether it be in the United States or \nEngland, Great Britain, one of our closest and most steadfast allies, a \nfriend whose men and women fought alongside of ours, but the question \nshould be, What kind of equipment can best secure victory as quickly as \npossible with a minimum of casualties?\n  Believe it or not, there is equipment that is manufactured in other \ncountries which is superior to our own--defense equipment--not many, \nbecause there is a tremendous imbalance between the amount and kinds of \nequipment that is purchased by our NATO Allies as opposed to the \nequipment that is purchased by the United States from our NATO \nAllies. But there still is some. For example, body armor. Body armor is \nused by the police departments, border patrol, and many law enforcement \nagencies, but not by the American military, because it is prohibited \nfrom doing so. Yet anyone who compares that manufactured in the U.S. to \nthat manufactured in the Netherlands will testify it is superior \nequipment.\n\n  What is our priority here in the Dayton amendment? Is the priority to \nprotect an American industry, and not allow our closest allies and \nfriends to compete to sell their products, their defense equipment, to \nthe United States of America, as we do in their countries? Everything \nfrom F-16s, to tanks, to incredible amounts of military equipment, \nbecause of our superiority, is purchased by our NATO allies, but we are \ngoing to be prohibited from purchasing any of theirs even if, in the \njudgment of the men and women in the military who test these things and \nmake the judgments, and the Secretary of Defense--we are not going to \nbuy it even if it is better equipment because we want to protect an \nindustry in the United States of America? We have seen this \nprotectionism going on here in the textile industry, even though the \nCaribbean countries are decimated because they cannot export their \nproduct to the United States.\n  Here we are talking about the lives of the men and women in the \nmilitary. Can we not at least allow our military to look at equipment \nmade by our closest allies to see if it is superior; that we might want \nto purchase it just as they purchase massive amounts of military \nequipment from us? Is the Senator from Minnesota--who, unfortunately, \nis not on the floor to respond--more interested in protecting an \nindustry or more interested in protecting the lives of the men and \nwomen\n\n[[Page S6825]]\n\nfighting in the military? Don't they deserve the very best equipment we \ncan procure? I am sorry, you cannot have the following equipment which \nis superior to that made in Minnesota because we want an industry in \nMinnesota to be protected. I don't get it. Frankly, neither will the \nmen and women in the military who are unable to function in the most \neffective fashion if they are deprived of the ability to procure the \nmost effective equipment.\n  We are talking about not every country in the world but our closest \nallies; we are talking about our closest friends--those who supported \nus in the war on Iraq and those who even sent troops, in the case of \nthe British, to fight alongside ours.\n  If the Dayton amendment is approved, no British manufacturer can \ncompete to sell equipment to the United States military. How do you \njustify that if it happens to be superior equipment? In the name of \nprotectionism, we would deprive the men and women in the military of \nthe best equipment we can find for them to fight and risk their lives.\n  Well, I have a second-degree amendment that states this removal of \nthe Buy America equipment would not apply to our six closest Allies. I \nhope my colleagues will see their way clear to vote in favor of it.\n  Let me also tell my colleagues one other practical effect. We now \ntell these countries that we cannot, under any circumstances, buy their \nequipment. These are the same countries that are buying billions of \ndollars of our military equipment--F-16s, Abrams tanks, Apache \nhelicopters. The list goes on and on. If you are running a company and \nyou manufacture military equipment and you get the word that the United \nStates, under no circumstances, will purchase it from you, what would \nyou say about proposed purchases of American-made equipment? I think \nthe answer is obvious. These are all freely elected governments, all \ngovernments that have to respond to their constituents. What will they \nsay?\n\n  So the effect of this Dayton amendment, if passed, would be some $5.5 \nbillion, which is the difference between what we buy from these \ncountries and what they buy from us on an annual basis. I hope we will \nbe able to adopt the substitute.\n  I understand my colleague's dismay and unhappiness about the \nperformance of the French government and, to a lesser degree, the \nGermans and the Belgians but I also remind my colleagues there was a \nvery large number of European countries that supported us, even in the \nface of public opinion which was against the government policy of \nsupporting us in Iraq. So their support will now be rewarded by a \nprohibition from buying any military equipment they manufacture in \ntheir country. I don't think that is fair. I don't think it is right. \nMost of all, I think it is wrong if we are not going to purchase the \nbest equipment no matter where it is produced in the world so our men \nand women in the military can best function in the safest and most \nefficient fashion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, I applaud the senior Senator from \nArizona for offering this second-degree amendment in the nature of a \nsubstitute. To characterize this amendment and this whole debate, we \nare getting down to where this is truly a referendum on the people who \nsupported us in the recent war. Our closest allies--people we are going \nto continue to go forward with in a very uncertain world--are they \npeople we are going to continue to work closely with when it comes to \ntimes of conflict?\n  The waiver is only for those six countries that worked with us very \nclosely in the recent Iraq conflict. We are probably limiting it down \ntoo far, but we are doing that to try to at least say to the people who \nwant the underlying Dayton amendment that we are going to at least \nlimit it to those six countries that worked with us most closely in the \nlast conflict.\n  Right now, we sell to them and they sell to us. We sell to them in \nmuch greater numbers than they sell to us. Normally, when we are \ntalking trade around this body, most countries are selling more to us \nthan we are to them. Yet we are still trying to lower tariffs on a lot \nof those countries to try to increase more trade back and forth. But in \nthis case, we dominate the defense industry in the world.\n  This amendment could threaten the domination we have of the defense \nindustry in the world. This amendment would say to our allies we want \nto sell you our products, but we are not willing to buy your products. \nThis, in effect, sets up a trade war with our closest allies. Do we \nwant to do that? No one wins in a trade war. Everybody loses. This \nwould send a very poor message at exactly the wrong time to set up a \ntrade war.\n  Our closest allies worked with us, as we saw, in Iraq. They were \nworking so well together in training, with our equipment, so that when \nwe go into a conflict, our communications devices could talk to each \nother. If we set up this kind of a trade war, we can threaten that type \nof integration in our training.\n  I fully support this amendment the Senator from Arizona has proposed \ntoday. I think the underlying amendment is faulty, and we need to have \nthis second-degree amendment in the nature of a substitute to make sure \nwe do not go down the wrong path.\n  I want to inform the rest of the Senators what we are trying to do \ntime-wise, as far as the schedule is concerned. We are trying to work \nout a unanimous consent agreement now to have a vote, hopefully \nsomewhere around 6 o'clock, if that is possible tonight, on the \nunderlying amendment, and then possibly on the second-degree amendment, \nand possibly after that have a side-by-side vote on the Dayton \namendment. We don't know whether or not that is possible. We are trying \nto work that out and to alert people of the potential schedule for \ntonight. There is no agreement worked out yet.\n  With that, Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, following the disposition of the matter \npending before the Senate--that is the Dayton amendment and the second-\ndegree amendment offered by the Senator from Arizona--I ask unanimous \nconsent that the Senator from Washington be recognized to offer an \namendment and make a statement and withdraw the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, we are waiting for the imminent return \nof Senator Warner so we can start a vote on the second-degree \namendment. While we are waiting--F-16s: The Netherlands, Belgium, \nNorway, Denmark, Singapore, United Arab Emirates; F-18s: Switzerland, \nFinland, Canada, and Australia; Tomahawk missiles: United Kingdom, \nIsrael; F-15s and F-16s, AAMs, air to air missiles, 31 countries we \nsell those to. All of that equipment is sold to these other countries, \nand they are at least under the understanding that they can compete to \nsell some of their equipment in our Nation.\n  It is remarkable. I would imagine that if the Dayton amendment goes \nthrough, we will see cancellations of a number of those commitments to \nbuy that equipment from the United States of America. No other freely \nelected government would do anything else.\n  I ask the Senator from Minnesota again the following question: If \nthere is a country that is a close ally of ours that can produce a \nbetter piece of military equipment at a lower price, and our military \ndecides it is the best with which we can provide our men and women in \nthe military, would the Senator from Minnesota reject that?\n  Mr. DAYTON. Madam President, I would not, in answer to the Senator's \nquestion, reject that. In fact, under\n\n[[Page S6826]]\n\ncurrent law, that is permitted. The Secretary of Defense can determine \nunder his sole authority that the items in question can be bought.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reclaiming my time, Madam President.\n  Mr. DAYTON. The Senator asked me a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona has the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The Senator from Minnesota ought to read his own \namendment because the effect of his amendment would be to prohibit \nthese countries from competing to sell their military equipment in the \nUnited States of America. I think that is a great disservice to the men \nand women in the military, and it is protectionism at its worst.\n  I would hope my colleagues will vote for the second-degree amendment. \nI yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Madam President, if I may respond to the Senator from \nArizona, I believe the Senator misunderstands my amendment. My \namendment strikes the language in the committee bill that would change \ncurrent law. My amendment returns us to existing law. It is a law that \nhas been on the books for 70 years. It is a law that has been followed \nby Democratic and Republican administrations. It permits everything the \nSenator described in terms of these various sales of equipment, \nmachinery, food, light clothing made by other countries when the \nSecretary of Defense shall determine on his sole authority that it is \nnot reasonably possible to acquire those products made in the United \nStates. It just says try to buy American. It does not even require it. \nIt says try to buy American.\n  It is a law that was passed in 1933. The Barry amendment was added \nspecifically to the Department of Defense in 1941. The Senate committee \nbill would change current law, and my amendment simply strikes that \nchange in the committee bill. It simply reverts us to current law, \nwhich has been good enough for Republican and Democratic \nadministrations for 70 years and permits just what the Senator said.\n  I share the Senator's desire, absolutely. Our Armed Forces should \nhave the best--the best equipment, the best clothing, the best food, \nthe best of everything. They should get it as rapidly as possible. They \ndeserve it because they are the most courageous men and women anywhere \nin the world, and they proved that once again in Iraq. Specifically, \nfor all these years, Congress has made clear in existing law that none \nof that shall be sacrificed. Quality shall not be sacrificed, speed \nshall not be sacrificed, nothing shall be sacrificed. But when all \nthings are equal and we have a choice, buy American because then those \npublic dollars are all going to have an additional benefit of providing \njobs or preserving jobs in the United States of America rather than \ngoing to people overseas.\n  That is a secondary public purpose. It does not conflict with the \nfirst, but when it can complement the first, Congress says do it that \nway. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, there is an old saying about everybody \nis entitled to their opinion, but not everybody is entitled to their \nfacts. The Department of Defense, to whom we give the responsibility to \ncarry out the procurement of weapons, says:\n\n       These flexibilities--\n\n  Which are in the bill--\n\n     are needed to counter restrictions that severely impede the \n     ability of the Department of Defense to promote our national \n     security policy that calls for standardization and \n     interoperability of conventional defense equipment used by \n     U.S. armed forces and used by the armed forces of our allies \n     and coalition partners. The Department of Defense should have \n     authority to make exceptions to these restrictions in the \n     interest of national security comparable to the public \n     interest exception authorized by the Buy America Act. By \n     providing these flexibilities, Congress better enables the \n     Department of Defense to acquire the best equipment and \n     technology available, promotes improved readiness and \n     capabilities of the U.S. armed forces, strengthens coalition \n     warfighting capabilities, promotes competition in contracting \n     needs of the U.S. armed forces. . . .\n\n  Obviously, the Department of Defense has a very different view of the \nimpact of this legislation than the Senator from Minnesota. My \ncolleagues can decide where the expertise lies. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I thank my distinguished colleague. We \nare ready to vote.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Madam President, I would like to have one minute to make \na final comment, if I may.\n  Mr. WARNER. How much time does the Senator need?\n  Mr. DAYTON. One minute.\n  Mr. WARNER. Of course.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I thank the chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Madam President, I acknowledge this current \nadministration in charge of the Department of Defense is entitled to \nits point of view. I point out my amendment returns us to current law. \nThat has worked and has given to Secretaries of Defense, including the \npresent one, discretion to do what the Senator from Arizona described \nhas already been enacted or put in effect in terms of defense \nprocurement.\n  It also, however, says that American jobs are important. At this \npoint in time when we have lost 2.8 million jobs in this country since \nthis administration took office, I think this is symptomatic of their \nlack of awareness and concern for employing Americans and doing so \nwhenever possible or putting them back to work. For this Congress and \nthe Senate to take the position, with 2.8 million people out of work in \nthe last 2\\1/2\\ years looking for jobs, exhausting their unemployment \nbenefits because they cannot find jobs, to say we cannot even be \nbothered to try to buy American before we go elsewhere I think is \nshameful.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Before we commence the vote, I ask the distinguished \nDemocratic leader if he would be willing to agree to a firm time \nagreement on this vote of 15 minutes to be followed immediately by a \nsecond vote of 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic minority whip.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, Madam President, I ask the \nSenator to modify his amendment so we would have a vote on the McCain \namendment; regardless of the outcome of the McCain amendment, that will \nbe followed by a vote on the Dayton amendment; that the McCain \namendment be 15 minutes in length and the Dayton amendment be 10 \nminutes in length.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object, if the pending amendment \nprevails, then it prevails. If the pending amendment fails, then we \nwould be agreeable to a voice vote.\n  Mr. REID. That may come later. At this stage, the Senator from \nMinnesota wishes a recorded vote.\n  Mr. McCAIN. After his amendment has been second-degreed?\n  Mr. REID. Yes. The arrangement we worked out--and that is why we \nmodified the unanimous consent request of the distinguished Senator \nfrom Virginia. Regardless of the outcome of the McCain amendment, we \nhave asked for a vote on the amendment of the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WARNER. That would be 10 minutes?\n  Mr. REID. That is right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Virginia so modify his \nunanimous consent request?\n  Mr. WARNER. So modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 783.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I announce that the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. \nDomenici) is necessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nEdwards) is necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). Are there any other Senators \nin the Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 50, nays 48, as follows:\n\n[[Page S6827]]\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 191 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--50\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham (SC)\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--48\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham (FL)\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n     Voinovich\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Domenici\n     Edwards\n       \n  The amendment (No. 783) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER.

Senator Warner and Senator Levin are going to \nwork to see how much of the bill can be completed tonight--maybe all of \nit.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I think that is a bit strong. The \nunderstanding on this side is that we would proceed on into the night.\n  Quite candidly, I say to colleagues, we are hoping to, one way or \nanother, either accept the amendments or stack votes tomorrow morning \nwhich would be consistent with the Senator's representation that there \nwill no further rollcall votes tonight.

Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Nevada if we have \nall of the amendments from that side which are going to be proposed?\n  Mr. REID. No. The minority has not offered all the amendments which \nthey intend to offer. I have kept in very close touch with the two \nmanagers of the bill.

Senator Schumer is near ready to offer his amendment. That \nwill require a vote tomorrow for sure. There are a couple of other \namendments we are working on.\n  Mr. WARNER. Might I inquire about the amendment of the Senator from \nCalifornia?\n  Mr. REID. She has indicated that she will not be ready to vote \ntonight. We are going to have to work on that in the morning. The \nSenator from California has been working with our manager. We hope to \nbe able to work something out on that. We don't have that finished yet.\n  We also have explained to the Senator from Virginia that Senator Byrd \nhas a problem, and we are going to try to work that out.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am working on that problem. It is a very \nlegitimate request. I am working on that tonight.\n  Mr. REID. Until we get Senator Byrd's problem resolved, we can't have \ntime for final passage.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator has made that case clear. So far as I know, I \ncan say for my side, I know of no request at this time for a rollcall \nvote. We will work through the amendments this evening.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? Do we have a list \nof all of the amendments on the Republican side?\n  Mr. WARNER. I think we are pretty near complete on that list. I have \nindicated to my colleagues that by this time they should have brought \nthe amendments to the managers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nWashington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, as many of my colleagues know, I have \ncome to the floor for 6 of the past 7 years to offer the Murray-Snowe \namendment to lift the restrictions on privately funded abortions for \nour military women serving overseas. We have offered this amendment \nvirtually every year since 1996 with the hope that one day women in the \nmilitary would not be required to sacrifice their constitutional right \nwhen they serve overseas.\n  Since 1996, this amendment has twice passed on the Senate floor only \nto be killed during conference. This amendment has always been relevant \nand germane, even in postcloture debate. The amendment simply ensures \naccess to safe and legal reproductive health care for our military \npersonnel. Access to safe and legal health care is certainly relevant \nwhen discussing the Department of Defense authorization bill.\n  I find it extremely hard to understand how after these 7 years this \ntopic is suddenly no longer relevant. It does not make sense. I think \nit is an outrage and an insult to the women who serve in our military. \nI would never want to have to tell a woman in our Armed Forces who is \nrisking her life to serve our country overseas that her health care is \nirrelevant in the Senate.\n  The intent of the Defense authorization bill is to ensure that our \nmilitary has the resources and support it needs to protect all of us. \nThe health of our female service members is certainly a key ingredient \nin a successful military. Today, women are serving side by side in \ncombat situations and in hostile war zones. Women are a critical part \nof our military. They serve in leadership roles, and they provide \noutstanding service. Their health care is relevant. I don't know how \nmany of my colleagues could come to the floor and argue any \ndifferently.\n  I thank the cosponsors of the amendment, including Senators Snowe, \nBoxer, Cantwell, Collins, Schumer, Jeffords, and Corzine.\n  My amendment would eliminate the restrictions on privately funded \nabortions only. It doesn't change conscience clauses for military \npersonnel. It doesn't require direct funding, and it would not result \nin a huge new mission for military health care.\n  Under current restrictions, women who volunteer to serve their \ncountry--and female military dependents--are not allowed to exercise \ntheir legally guaranteed right simply because they are serving \noverseas. These women are committed to protecting our rights as free \ncitizens. Yet they are denied one of the most basic rights accorded all \nwomen in this country. Women depend on their base hospital and military \ncare providers to meet all of their health care needs. Singling out \nabortion-related services could jeopardize a woman's health.\n  The truth is, women serving overseas have very few options when \nfacing a difficult pregnancy. They can seek care in a host country, but \nfew countries have the standard of health care that we take for granted \nhere at home. These women service members can seek leave--not medical \nleave--and be transported back to the United States.\n  These are difficult options which put women's lives in jeopardy. That \nis why retired GEN Claudia Kennedy, the Army's first woman three-star \ngeneral, supported my amendment. She has firsthand knowledge of women \nwho face this difficult experience, and she wrote to me about one of \nthose women. She told me:\n       [T]hat in a very vulnerable time, this American who was \n     serving her country overseas could not count on the Army to \n     give her the care she needed.\n\n  The impact of this unconstitutional restriction on women's health is \nsupported by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, \nthe American Medical Women's Association, Physicians for Reproductive \nChoice and Health, and the National Partnership for Women and Families.\n\n[[Page S6828]]\n\n  In the past, some have argued that allowing privately funded \nabortions in military facilities overseas would be a huge burden that \nthe military couldn't meet.\n  I wish to point out that the previous administration endorsed my \namendment and saw no problems implementing this policy.\n  I also add that under current law the military is required to provide \nabortion-related services when a woman's life is in jeopardy in the \ncase of rape or incest. To say that the military cannot provide this \nservice calls into question that ability to meet current law.\n  In the past, we have had concerns raised about objections from host \ncountries. Abortion is illegal in many countries, as is family planning \nfor unmarried women. In some countries, simply allowing them to drive \ncan violate local customs and laws.\n  I think the military has a long tradition of respecting the laws and \ncustoms of host countries without delegating women to second-class \ncitizenship status or sacrificing our own proud history of equal \ntreatment under law. Current restrictions humiliate servicewomen by \nforcing them to seek the approval of their commanding officer in order \nto travel back to the United States for abortion services.\n  We know from a previous GAO report issued in May of 2002 that many \ncommanding officers ``have not been adequately trained about the \nimportance of women's basic health care.'' Department of Defense \nofficials say that lacking this understanding, some commanders may be \nreluctant to allow active-duty members, both women and men, time away \nfrom their duty stations to obtain health care services.\n  Many women are forced to seek care off the base or wait until leave \ncan be arranged without approval from a commanding officer.\n  Many women are forced to delay the procedure for several weeks until \nthey can travel to a location where safe and adequate care is \navailable.\n  I have to tell you, I do not see why lifting this offensive and \ndangerous restriction now--this year--is not relevant to a Department \nof Defense authorization bill. Isn't it our goal to provide the \nresources and support for our military personnel? How can the health \nand safety of women who serve in the military all of a sudden be called \nnot relevant?\n\n  I have been told that if I offer this amendment, the Chair is going \nto rule it out of in order on the claim it is not relevant, so I have \nno choice but to withdraw my amendment.\n  I do not know how we explain to military servicewomen that their \nhealth care is not relevant or that supporting their access to safe and \nlegal reproductive health care is somehow now not part of the Defense \nauthorization bill.\n  This is a sad day for our country when women who are serving their \ncountry overseas are told their health care is not relevant by the \nSenate.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am asking the Senator from Washington to \nyield for a question.\n  Frankly, I am surprised, and I think it is a travesty that you are \nnot able to offer your amendment. I do not understand on what \nlegislation this would be relevant if not this legislation. I know you \nhave offered it previously on the Defense authorization. I have voted \nfor it on the Defense authorization on previous occasions. And this \nseems to me to be the same kind of trap we have discovered now with \nrespect to the amendment dealing with concurrent receipts for retired \nveterans who also have been disabled who are prevented from collecting \nboth. We are told that is not relevant. My amendment to scrap the 2005 \nbase closing round, we are told that is not relevant.\n  I wonder if there is any legislation on which these kinds of \namendments would be more relevant than the Defense authorization? It is \nwhere they should be offered. It is the location of this debate. It is \nwhere this debate must be held. Somehow we have gotten into this trap \nof being told this is not relevant. Clearly, it is relevant.\n  So can the Senator from Washington tell me, is there another piece of \nlegislation where this would be more appropriately offered? I cannot \nthink of one.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator is absolutely correct.\n  There is no other piece of legislation that is before us where this \nis relevant. In fact, I have offered this six times on the Department \nof Defense authorization bill, even postcloture, and it was considered \nrelevant.\n  I am shocked and amazed that women are being told today they are not \nrelevant. I am furious that women are being told they are not relevant \nwhen it comes to the Department of Defense, when it comes to their \nhealth care, and when it comes to the Senate.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator will yield further for another question, \nif you offered this postcloture on previous occasions--it relates to a \nquestion that was asked yesterday--has the judgment about what is \nrelevant changed here in this Chamber? The answer to that, in my \njudgment, is yes. In my judgment, this would have been relevant under \nalmost any other set of circumstances.\n  But I wonder if the Senator from Washington would agree with me that \nwe should never, ever again--I will never, ever again allow a unanimous \nconsent agreement on the floor of the Senate on an authorization bill \nof this type to decide that we will restrict ourselves to relevant \namendments. If the definition of ``relevancy'' is reasonable and \nthoughtful, then that is just fine with me, but in this case it has not \nbeen.\n\n  It is a travesty of justice that the Senator from Washington is not \nable to offer her amendment today. The same is true with concurrent \nreceipt, and the same is true with base closings. So I would say there \nwill not be a unanimous consent request that gets consent to say on the \nnext authorization bill we will limit ourselves only to relevant \namendments.\n  It is quite clear now the definition of ``relevancy'' has changed in \na way that disadvantages the Senator from Washington and others who \nwant to offer amendments that are clearly relevant to this bill and \nhave always been relevant to this bill, but now we are discovering, for \nsome reason, it has been ruled nonrelevant. I think that is a travesty.\n  I say to the Senator from Washington, would the Senator agree that \nshe would want to join those of us who object to these further \nunanimous consent requests on future bills with respect to relevancy, \nif this is the way ``relevancy,'' if this is the way ``relevant'' is \ngoing to be defined here in the Senate?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I hear the Senator, and I absolutely agree. And I will \njoin with any Senators who object to any bill coming up when the word \n``relevant'' is being used.\n  I have been in public policy for almost two decades now, and \n``relevancy'' and ``germaneness'' have meant specific things to all of \nus, and we have offered relevant amendments, including the amendment I \nmeant to offer tonight, and they have always been relevant. They have \nbeen relevant on this bill six times already, even postcloture.\n  It seems to me now we have a definition for ``relevancy'' that is \nabove the definition of ``germaneness,'' and that is simply \nunbelievable to me. I concur with the Senator, the only thing we have \nleft is to not agree to any unanimous consent requests that use the \nword ``relevancy.''\n  But I say to my colleague, it seems to me the word ``relevancy'' is \nnow putting a lot of people into being irrelevant: veterans, when it \ncomes to concurrent receipt; communities that are trying very hard to \nkeep stable, when it comes to base closures; and now women--we are all \nirrelevant. I find that extremely upsetting.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I am happy to yield to the Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I just want to say to my friend from North Dakota and my \nfriend from Washington State--who has been such a leader on women's \nissues, family issues, and children's issues--and to my friend from \nIllinois, who is in the Chamber, who I know is also concerned about \nthis--this is really the first time I have ever seen a circumstance \nquite like this.\n  When the Senator from North Dakota says it is putting the Senator\n\n[[Page S6829]]\n\nfrom Washington at a disadvantage, I have a question for the Senator \nfrom Washington.\n  When the Senator from North Dakota says she is put at a disadvantage, \nlet me just say it goes far beyond that. Who are being put at a \ndisadvantage here, I would say, are the women who serve in the Armed \nForces. My God, we lost them in Iraq. We all know the story of Jessica \nLynch. We all revere the men and women in uniform. And in this bill, we \nknow, unless my friend gets a chance--a chance--to remove a \nrestriction, a woman in the military who finds herself in a very \ntroubling situation, who wants to exercise her legal rights, a health \ncare right that is legal and constitutional--she cannot even use her \nown money and have a safe abortion. This is the fact.\n\n  I say to my friend, yes, my friend is being inconvenienced, but I \nknow she stands up for the women in the military tonight. It is a very \nsad night to hear that the most relevant of amendments that deals with \nwomen in the military cannot be offered.\n  I say to my friend--because I will ask her a question--does she not \nbelieve this is a slap from the Senate to the women who are serving so \nbravely in uniform?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator from California is correct. This is a real \nslap in the face to the women who serve us overseas in the military, \nwho are asked every single day to protect us, to fight for what we \nbelieve in, to fight for our freedoms. They are being told they are \nsecond-class citizens and, worse yet, they are irrelevant in the \nSenate.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I am happy to.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I asked the Senator if she would yield for \na question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. It is my understanding that you have not offered this \namendment at this point.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I have not offered it yet. I am about to make a request \nto do so.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to ask, on your consent, to be added as a \ncosponsor of this amendment, if that meets with your approval, first.\n  I would like to ask, initially, is it not true that this question of \nrelevancy has been directed to the Parliamentarian of the Senate?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. That is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. And you have submitted your amendment to the \nParliamentarian, and they have said it is not relevant to the bill?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. That is correct. We have submitted it to the \nParliamentarian, who told us it was not relevant. We came back and \nworked to try to change the language. We were told it needed to touch \nfour corners. I don't have a clue what that means, but we were told it \nwould be ruled irrelevant.\n  Mr. DURBIN. You offered this amendment to this same bill on six \ndifferent occasions?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. That is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. It appears we either have a new rule or the rule has \nchanged when it comes to the Department of Defense authorization bill.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The rules have definitely changed, I say to the Senator, \nbecause I have offered this amendment postcloture and it has been \nconsidered relevant before.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I recall correctly--the Senator can correct me if I am \nwrong--but postcloture there would even be a higher standard.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. That has always been my understanding of the issue of \ngermaneness and relevancy. So I am at odds with the definitions we have \nbeen presented with at this time.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator from North Dakota has made it clear, when we \ntried to offer an amendment on the Base Closing Commission--which is \nincluded in this bill, incidentally, and which was created by this \nbill--it, too, has been judged irrelevant.\n  I would like to ask the Senator this question: If an amendment is \nconsidered germane, does the Senator not agree with me that it, in most \ninterpretations, has passed the test of relevancy? Isn't that a lower \nstandard by parliamentary rule?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I have always understood the definition of ``relevancy'' \nto be a lower standard than the issue of germaneness.\n  Mr. DURBIN. May I make a parliamentary inquiry of the Chair?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will state his inquiry.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Would the Chair state for the record the standard that is \nbeing used to determine the relevancy of amendments being offered?\n  Mr. WARNER. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is not in order.\n  Mr. WARNER. I apologize to the Chair. I have six things going on at \none time.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I made a parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois has made a \nparliamentary inquiry. The Chair is considering the inquiry. There is a \nparliamentary inquiry pending.\n  This is the test of relevancy:\n\n       When relevancy of amendments is required by a unanimous \n     consent agreement, that test is broader than the germaneness \n     test as it is a subject matter test, and amendments that deal \n     with the subject matter of the bill to which this requirement \n     attaches are in order, provided they do not contain any \n     significant matter not dealt with in that bill.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. May I ask a further inquiry of the Chair. Could he make \nreference to what he has just read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. From page 1362 of Riddick's Procedures, \nfootnote 352.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Might I ask, further parliamentary inquiry, do I \nunderstand what the Chair has just said as a response to my inquiry \nthat the standard for relevance is higher than the standard of \ngermaneness?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No, it is not.\n  Mr. DURBIN. So if this amendment has been found to be germane \npostcloture with previous bills, it would suggest to me it obviously \nhas met the standard, at least the standard of relevance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair would suggest the language in \nprevious bills is not exactly the same as the language in this bill.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, reclaiming my right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I find that simply astounding. Department of Defense \nbills are essentially language that changes for different military \nprograms, all kinds of things in the bills. But certainly the issue of \nwhether or not a woman has a right to have safe and legal health care \noverseas when she is serving her country has been ruled as germane in \nthe past. It seems obviously pretty out of order and extraordinary that \nthat would be where we are tonight.\n  Let me just do this, because I think all of us agree this amendment \nis one that has been considered on the bill before. It does deal with a \nwoman's ability to have safe health care. It is one that has been ruled \ngermane twice in postcloture times. I would just ask unanimous consent \nthat the rule on relevancy at this time be waived so I can offer the \namendment tonight, because I think it is important that we allow a \nprocedure that has been done many times before to continue under this \nbill.\n  I ask unanimous consent to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to waiving the unanimous \nconsent request?\n  Mr. WARNER. Objection from the Senator from Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I find that very troubling. I find it \ntroubling the Senate has now decided to change the definition of \nrelevancy we have operated under in the Senate as long as I have been \nhere. It appears very clear to me now that the issue of relevancy is a \nmuch higher standard than the issue of germaneness. We have stepped \ninto a realm most of us are going to be very sorry we are in.\n\n  I again will say to my colleagues that having objected to waiving \nthis relevancy, having listened to how we have now changed the \ndefinition of relevancy, what we are really doing is saying to women in \nthis country they are irrelevant. I find that to be very sad, Mr. \nPresident.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. May I say to my distinguished colleague from Washington \nthat I recognize through the years she has been a steadfast proponent \nfor those women in the armed services faced with the difficult choice \nyou have\n\n[[Page S6830]]\n\noutlined to the Senate tonight. I express regret, but the distinguished \nranking member and myself have been, throughout the deliberations on \nthis bill, not acting in any way as the Supreme Court to overrule the \nruling of the Parliamentarian on these amendments. We have tried to be \nfair, equitable on both sides. We have not waived one time. It is with \nregret that I had to interpose this objection because I recognize the \nmerits of the amendment which you have had. You have done it now how \nmany years, Senator?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Seven years.\n  Mr. WARNER. Seven years.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes, indeed.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask the Senator from Virginia, what I am having \ntrouble understanding is why an amendment that has been considered \ngermane in the past tonight under the ruling is not considered \nrelevant. I would ask the Senator from Virginia if he is not also \ntroubled that we have now set a definition for relevancy that is higher \nthan the standard for germaneness that may indeed trouble us far into \nthe future?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I respond to my colleague, with all due \nrespect, I will not try and engage in an evaluation of how the \nParliamentarian goes about the votes; that is, determining whether or \nnot each amendment is relevant. But I would say I do not recall in \nyears past the issue of relevancy having been raised on the Senator's \namendment. I stand to be corrected.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, if I could just respond to the Senator, \nthis amendment I am offering tonight in the past has been ruled in \npostcloture as germane. I am now tonight being told it is not relevant.\n  Mr. WARNER. It depends on the content of the bill to which that \nruling was addressed.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I would add this amendment has been offered seven times, \nvirtually every year since 1996, on this exact bill, the Department of \nDefense authorization.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me try to understand this a bit, what \nthe circumstances are. My understanding is the Senator from Washington \nhas propounded a unanimous consent request that has been objected to \nthat would have allowed her to offer her amendment notwithstanding the \nruling on relevancy. My understanding is this amendment is now viewed \nas nonrelevant to this bill, despite the fact it has been offered seven \ntimes before. If it is nonrelevant to the Defense authorization bill, I \nwould like to ask the Chair what would be the circumstances in the \nSenate from a parliamentary standpoint if the Senator from Washington \noffered this amendment to the Defense appropriations bill? In a moment \nI would like to get a response if I could because there are two bills \nthat come to the floor of the Senate that we know each year are going \nto deal with the issue of defense. One is the Defense authorization \nbill, and the other will be Defense appropriations. If this is deemed \nnonrelevant to the Defense authorization bill, I would ask the \nPresiding Officer whether the amendment could be offered to the Defense \nappropriations bill without a point of order being made?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is not possible to prejudge a ruling when \nthe content of a bill is not before us.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me inquire further, if I might. Would this amendment, \nbased on the knowledge of the Parliamentarian about the amendment, \nwould this amendment be considered legislating on an appropriations \nbill should it be offered to an appropriations bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We do not have the amendment in front of us \nbecause the Senator has not called it up.\n  Mr. DORGAN. To the extent the Office of the Parliamentarian has ruled \nthe amendment nonrelevant, my assumption is the Office of the \nParliamentarian has certainly understood the amendment, reviewed it, \nand determined it to be nonrelevant.\n  If that is the case, if the Office of the Parliamentarian understands \nthe amendment, my question remains, if this amendment is offered during \nconsideration of Defense appropriations, would there be a point of \norder against the amendment as legislating on an appropriations bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is probably a legislative amendment.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, that means if it is a legislative \namendment on an appropriations bill, there would be a point of order \nagainst it; is that the case?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is possible a point of order would lie.\n  Mr. DORGAN. So a point of order could be raised that would lie \nagainst the amendment because it is then legislating on an \nappropriations bill. If that is the case, as I understand the answer \nfrom the Chair, we are in a circumstance where we have told the Senator \nfrom Washington that her amendment dealing with an important issue--\nclearly to the center of this bill on Defense--cannot be offered on the \nDefense authorization bill because it is not relevant to the Defense \nauthorization bill.\n  Then the Senator would be told later, when she tries to offer it to \nthe Defense appropriations bill, this is legislating on a Defense \nappropriations bill and a point of order would rise against it. Why? \nBecause she should have offered it to the authorization bill.\n  Can someone tell me whether that is not a Catch-22 for the Senator \nfrom Washington and others? Have we not put her and others in a \ncircumstance where they are prevented from offering this amendment \nunder every circumstance? Isn't that the case? We say to her, you \ncannot offer it on the authorization bill. So then she comes to the \nDefense appropriations bill and offers it. The point of order is \nraised, and the point of order says, you know what, you cannot offer it \non appropriations. You should have offered it on the authorization \nbill.\n  That is what the Senator from Washington is going to be told. I just \nask the rhetorical question, Does anybody in the Chamber think that is \nfair? Not me.\n  I know there wasn't a deliberate attempt for anybody to be unfair, \nbut I make the point that the consent request entered into with respect \nto this issue of relevancy has put people in a position--especially \nSenator Reid, myself, and Senator Murray from Washington on this \nissue--that is pretty untenable. But that is the position we are in.\n  I think the way to get out of it is to understand that somehow these \nthings could be offered, or should be offered, and a unanimous consent \nbe allowed for these issues to be debated and voted on. I cannot \nbelieve it would have been the intent of my colleague from Virginia, or \nthe ranking member from Michigan, to say we want to prevent an \namendment that has been offered seven times previously to this bill, \nwhich we all understand is clearly relevant to the bill.\n  Again, I say as I said yesterday, the folks who understand this \nprocess from our side were very surprised at the issue of relevancy and \nhow the rulings on relevancy occurred. I know yesterday during this \ndiscussion a question was propounded by my colleague from Virginia, the \nchairman, to the Presiding Officer to ask whether the standard of \nrelevancy has changed. And the answer was, no, it has not.\n\n  That is not accurate. It clearly has changed. My colleague from \nWashington is evidence of that. If her amendment was germane \npostcloture previously, then her amendment, by definition, had to have \nbeen relevant postcloture. And if it is relevant then, and it is not \nrelevant now, the standard has changed.\n  I don't think that was the intention of the chairman or ranking \nmember with respect to her amendment--mine or any other amendment. I am \nnot asking or suggesting bad faith on anybody's part, but we have an \nunintended consequence. If an unintended consequence says to the \nSenator from Washington, I am sorry, you cannot offer your amendment on \nthe authorization bill, and when you try it later--as she will and \nmust--on the appropriations bill, she will be told she should have \noffered it on the authorization bill, that puts her in a position that \nis unfair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will state it.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to ask for clarification \nbecause I\n\n[[Page S6831]]\n\nthink this is an important question. If you would provide a response to \nthe following parliamentary inquiry, it is my understanding--in fact, I \nhave the amendment before me that has been suggested by the Senator \nfrom Washington. This is an amendment that relates to the use of \nDepartment of Defense medical facilities, and it amends section 1093 of \ntitle X of the U.S. Code, as amended.\n  Now, if the Chair would just take legislative notice of the bill, S. \n1050, and turn to page 157, you will see title VII, ``Health Care.''\n  Now, if you turn to page 10, you will find in section 703 an \namendment--language within the authorization bill relative to extension \nof authority to enter into personal service contracts for health care \nservices to be performed at locations outside medical treatment \nfacilities. It goes on to amend section 1091(a)(2) of title X. Here we \nhave an amendment relative to health care, relative to the medical \ntreatment facilities managed by the Department of Defense, which seeks \nto amend section 1093.\n  Already in this provision of the bill, we amend section 1091. Can the \nChair tell me how we can amend the same section of the law relative to \nmedical treatment facilities, and the amendment being offered by the \nSenator from Washington not be a relevant amendment? It is in the same \nsection relative to health care, on the subject of health care. It \nrelates to Defense medical facilities, as do many of the amendments \nwithin that section.\n  Yet the Chair is telling us it is not relevant language to this \nsection of the pending bill, which the Senator from Washington seeks to \namend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair is considering the inquiry.\n  The point is whether the issue presented by the Senator's amendment \nis addressed in the bill, which it is not.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Further parliamentary inquiry.\n  The issue being addressed by the Senator from Washington is the \ntreatment afforded at Defense medical facilities. If the Chair will \nnote in section 703 of the bill, it relates to the treatment afforded \nat Defense medical facilities. How much more relevant could this be?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The advice given on this were preliminary \nrulings, subject to further information, based upon information \navailable at the time the amendment was presented.\n  The Chair is not aware that this argument has ever been presented to \nthe Parliamentarian's Office. The burden would be on the sponsors to \nmake that case.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Further inquiry: If the Senator from Washington should \nsubmit this amendment now, will it then be incumbent upon the Chair and \nthe Parliamentarian to rule on its relevancy?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ruling would only be made if the amendment \nis challenged under the unanimous consent request. The Senator from \nWashington--\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, if this amendment is presented at this time \nto the Parliamentarian, will we obtain a ruling as to whether or not it \nis relevant?\n  Is there any reason why the request of the Parliamentarian, relative \nto this amendment as to whether or not it is relevant, cannot be \nresponded to by the Parliamentarian at this time or at any time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If a ruling is requested, a ruling will be \nissued.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 691\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I send my amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mrs. Murray], for herself, Ms. \n     Snowe, Ms. Boxer, and Ms. Cantwell, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 691.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To restore a previous policy regarding restrictions on use of \n                   Department of Defense facilities)\n\n       At the end of title VII, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 708. RESTORATION OF PREVIOUS POLICY REGARDING \n                   RESTRICTIONS ON USE OF DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE \n                   MEDICAL FACILITIES.\n\n       Section 1093 of title 10, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) by striking subsection (b); and\n       (2) in subsection (a), by striking ``Restriction on Use of \n     Funds.--''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum to allow \ntime in which the Parliamentarian can examine the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senator Murray is waiting for a ruling from \nthe Chair on her parliamentary inquiry.\n  In the meantime, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Carper be \nrecognized to speak for up to 10 minutes, and that following his \nspeech, the Senator from Washington be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I thank the assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. President, in considering the military priorities of our country, \nwe are addressing one of the most important challenges facing our \nNation and its Government. That challenge is to transform America's \nmilitary to meet the threats of this century the 21st century, and to \ndo so in an environment of increasingly severe budgetary constraints.\n  The spectrum of potential conflict in which America could find itself \nengaged over the coming years is practically limitless. From fighting \nmajor regional powers to pursuing shadowy bands of terrorists, the \nmissions our military must be ready to perform are many, and they are \nvaried.\n  Unfortunately, the resources available to us in preparing to meet \nthese challenges are not without limit.\n  What was the largest surplus in the history of this Government just 2 \nshort years ago has given way to the largest deficit in our Nation's \nhistory. And this has happened at a time when the demands on the \nFederal budget are growing and will continue to grow.\n  Recent reports out of Iraq indicate that the task of post-war \nreconstruction will be neither easy nor cheap. Recent events in Saudi \nArabia and Morocco indicate that the war on terrorism may still be in \nits infancy.\n  There are also domestic priorities that demand attention. The \nbipartisan education reform initiative passed in the first year of the \nPresident's term has yet to be fully funded. There is a growing \nrecognition that our health care system is fraying at the seams. And \nthe baby boomers, my generation, are marching toward retirement. When \nthey get there, it will place unprecedented strains on Social Security \nand Medicare.\n  Our present course is not sustainable. We will soon be asked to raise \nthe ceiling on the national debt by nearly $1 trillion. At the same \ntime, the administration is projecting that within 5 years funding for \ndefense will rise to more than 20 percent above cold-war levels. Even \nat that high level, moreover, it is doubtful that the defense budget \ncould accommodate the full cost of the administration's plans as they \ncurrently stand.\n  This is our dilemma. We cannot afford to forego military \ntransformation. The threats to our security are simply too great. But \nneither can we afford to proceed without consideration to cost. After \nall, it is our quality of life that the military is charged with \ndefending. It is that same quality of life that will eventually begin \nto erode in the absence of a sense of fiscal balance.\n  What I want to talk about for a few minutes this evening is one of \nthe central components of military transformation. I want to talk both \nabout its importance and about some of the choices we can make to \naddress our security requirements in this area in a cost-effective \nmanner.\n  Strategic airlift will be one of the cornerstones of successful \nmilitary transformation. The imperative to transform our military is \ndriven by the necessity to project force faster, with\n\n[[Page S6832]]\n\ngreater precision, and over greater distances. As President Bush stated \nin his commencement address at the U.S. Naval Academy in May 2001, \nAmerica's future force will be ``defined less by size and more by \nmobility and swiftness.''\n  In the wake of the cold war, the United States has closed two-thirds \nof its forward operating bases. Yet the four services are all in the \nprocess of speeding up the timeframe in which they expect to deploy \ntroops and equipment to the far corners of the globe.\n  The Army's stated goal, for example, is to deploy an Interim Brigade \nCombat Team--complete with 3,500 personnel, 327 armored vehicles, 600 \nwheeled vehicles, air defense weapons, artillery, and engineering \nequipment--anywhere in the world within 96 hours. Airlift is the only \nmeans to accomplish this objective.\n  In March 2001, the Joint Chiefs of Staff completed a review of our \nNation's strategic airlift requirement. This study was completed before \nSeptember 11 and all that has flowed from that terrible day. Still, the \nconclusion of that study was that the Nation's airlift requirement had \nrisen 10 percent sine the last study was conducted just 5 years before.\n  Many believe that the changed security environment post-September 11 \nhas actually increased our strategic airlift requirement still farther. \nWe are requesting, as part of this bill, that a new review of the \nstrategic airlift requirement going forward be conducted. We expect \nthat what we will find is that the airlift requirement is higher than \nthe 54.5 million ton miles per day specified before September 11.\n  Regardless of whether the requirement has risen or not, however, the \nfact remains that our present capacity falls short of the requirement \nas it was spelled out just 2 years ago. The question we must answer, \ntherefore, is how will we maintain and how will we build a strategic \nairlift fleet that will meet the relevant requirement and do so without \nbusting our budget even more. In other words, how do we provide cost-\neffective strategic airlift for the 21st century?\n  Some of the Air Force have launched a campaign to retire more than \nhalf of the Air Force's C-5 fleet over the next few years, specifically \nthose that date back to the 1970s, the C-5As. Maintenance problems, \nparticularly engine problems, have plagued the C-5As for years. The \nsolution for some in the Air Force is to simply get rid of them and to \nrely primarily on the procurement of new aircraft to meet our growing \nstrategic airlift requirement.\n  In order to meet the new, higher requirement for strategic airlift in \nthe 21st century, we will certainly need to purchase new aircraft. The \nAir Force is currently in the process of purchasing some 180 new C-17s. \nI support this purchase. The C-17 is an excellent aircraft, and we are \nexcited that a squadron of 12 C-17 cargo aircraft will be stationed at \nDover Air Force Base in Delaware beginning in 2008.\n  Having said that, sending more than half of our Nation's C-5 fleet to \nthe ``boneyard'' makes no sense. The C-5 is, and will continue to be, \nthe workhorse of American airlift. The C-5 completed nearly 5,000 \nsorties during the recent Iraq war and delivered nearly half of the \ncargo and troops into combat.\n  Moreover, a balance of C-5s and C-17s offers the Air Force an \nadvantageous mix of complementary capabilities. The C-5 can carry more, \nand can carry farther. The C-17 is more maneuverable on the ground. \nDuring the war in Afghanistan, much of the cargo was flown from the \ncontinental United States to Europe in large loads aboard C-5s. The \ncargo was then broken down into smaller loads and flown into theatre by \nC-17s.\n  As a former naval flight officer who has known firsthand the \nfrustration of naval aircraft that had a propensity to break down, I \ncan empathize with the frustration that some in the Air Force feel with \nrespect to the C-5As chronically low mission-capable rates. But \nscrapping the entire platform is not the answer.\n  The wings and the fuselages of both the C-5As and the C-5Bs have \nuseful lives--listen to this--of another 30 to 40 years. For the cost \nof purchasing a single new C-17 cargo aircraft, three C-5s can be \noutfitted with reliable new engines, modern hydraulics systems, and \nlanding gear components, plus a new avionics package and radios that \nwill bring C-5 cockpits into the 21st century.\n  All of these upgrades are off the shelf. They are readily available, \nand they are capable of bringing the mission capable rates of the C-5s \nin line with those of the C-17s.\n  Given the fact that one C-5 can haul 80 percent more cargo than one \nC-17, the same dollar invested in modernizing C-5s produces more than \nfive times the airlift capacity of the same dollar invested in the \npurchase of new C-17 aircraft.\n  A strategic airlift fleet with a full complement of C-5s and C-17s \noffers the best of all worlds. Retaining the enormous cargo capacity of \nour C-5s, both As and Bs, will make it easier to achieve the full \nairlift requirement of our Armed Forces in the 21st century. \nMaintaining a healthy balance of C-5s and C-17s will offer the Air \nForce maximal operational flexibility. And taking full advantage of the \ncost savings that comes from modernizing, as opposed to scrapping, the \nC-5As will free-up resources to meet other Air Force priorities and \nreduce our Federal deficit over the long run.\n  Choices that are more cost-effective by ratios of 5-to-1 are \nprecisely the kinds of choices we ought to be interested in making as \nwe seek to transform our military without burying our children in red \nink.\n  I want to take a moment, in closing, to thank a number of members of \nthe Armed Services Committee. I particularly thank Senators Warner, \nLevin, Kennedy, and Talent for the work they have done to ensure that \nwe continue to capitalize on the contribution that the C-5 can make to \ncost-effective strategic airlift in the 21st century. Besides calling \non the Air Mobility Command to look again at our Nation's airlift \nrequirement, this bill keeps C-5 modernization on track. In particular, \nit specifies that 18 C-5Bs and 12 C-5As will be revamped with modern \navionics in fiscal year 2004.\n  This is a win--a win for our fighting men and women, and it is a win \nfor the American taxpayer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to commend our distinguished \ncolleague from Delaware. He has worked very diligently on this issue \nsince the first moment he joined the Senate. You have been very helpful \nto the distinguished ranking member and myself in bringing these \nmatters to our attention and to other members of the committee. I think \nthe Department of the Air Force and indeed the whole Armed Forces that \nare so heavily dependent on airlift owe you a debt of gratitude.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nWashington is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield for 30 seconds.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I join in the commendation to the Senator of Delaware for \nhis tenacity in keeping airlift available.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I understand the Senate is waiting for a \nruling from the Parliamentarian of the relevancy of the amendment I \nsent to the desk and I ask if that ruling is ready.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is the opinion of the Chair, with the \nadditional information provided, the Senator's amendment is relevant.\n  The Democratic whip.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have had a conversation with the Senator \nfrom Washington. She would be willing to enter into a reasonable time \nagreement. She would want to complete that debate tomorrow, however, in \nthat the hour is late and she has spent so much time here already. I \nwould be happy to work with the two managers of the bill to come up \nwith a reasonable time she can debate this in the morning and have a \nvote on it in the morning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. My understanding is you are not making a request, you are \njust advising the Chair and the Senate. I wish to, in courtesy, advise \nyou I know of at least one amendment in the second degree and there \ncould be two.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Would the Senator yield? Who has the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n[[Page S6833]]\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am wondering whether we will have the language of those \namendments or amendment this evening?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would have to inquire of the language of \nthe amendments.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Any second-degree amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to make two comments in \nmorning business, not on the bill. I want to leave it to the Senators \nfrom Virginia and Michigan if there is anything they want to do on the \nbill this evening.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we are endeavoring to do a good deal of \nwork on the bill this evening. I don't know the duration of the time \nthe Senator wishes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask for 5 minutes in morning business.\n  Mr. WARNER. As soon as we are able to conclude the matters relating \nto the amendment of the Senator from Washington, I can better answer \nthe question.\n  Mr. President, I wish to advise my colleagues on our side we, of \ncourse, had relied upon the previous ruling of the Parliamentarian. \nTherefore, these amendments are not yet ready.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Do you expect they would be ready tonight if we are here \nfor an additional half hour?\n  Mr. WARNER. I think there is an opportunity they could be ready. We \nare checking.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic whip.\n  Mr. REID. We would be willing to enter into a time agreement if we \nsaw the amendments and they were reasonable and we thought we could do \nthat. But not having them, we can't do that. The Senator from \nWashington, if there would have been an up-or-down amendment, would \nhave agreed to a 40-minute time limit evenly divided.\n  Mr. WARNER. Do I understand the distinguished leader to say 40 \nminutes equally divided?\n  Mr. REID. That is right. I would note we have very few amendments. \nSenator Dodd has one. Senator Daschle has one. Senator Boxer has one we \nhave already discussed, and Senator Biden has one. We have very few \namendments. Some of these may be worked out by the managers. The \nDaschle amendment, as we have indicated, would be 20 minutes evenly \ndivided. The Schumer amendment has been declared not relevant so we \ncan't take that up. The Boxer amendment, we agreed to a one-hour time \nagreement on that. Both managers know what that amendment is. Senator \nBiden has agreed to 30 minutes on his amendment if it is not agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am informed we have not seen the Boxer \namendment.\n  Mr. REID. Well, she was showing it to anybody who wanted to look at \nit.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, let us try to obtain a copy of that \namendment, if I could ask the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. WARNER. I think it would be best served if we put in a quorum \ncall so we can try and put the pieces together.\n  Mr. President, as I understand, the distinguished Senator from \nIllinois wishes to address the Senate as in morning business for 7 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, my thanks to the Senators from Virginia \nand Michigan for accommodating me. I thank the Parliamentarian. I have \nbeen in a similar position in another legislative body. It is a tough \nassignment. I thank them for their courtesy and diligence and the \nruling they have offered to us.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Durbin are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am prepared to yield the floor, but I \nwould like to give the Senator from Virginia or any other Senator on \nthe floor an opportunity to claim the time. Otherwise, I will raise the \nquestion of the presence of a quorum.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have conferred with the two managers--I \nwas going to say more than I wanted to, but I will not say that, but I \nconferred with the two managers often tonight, and it appears the \nSenate will be best served by clearing a number of amendments that the \ntwo managers have worked on for several days now. They have \napproximately a dozen amendments. They would do that tonight.\n  I put this in the form of a unanimous consent request: that tomorrow \nmorning, when the Senate convenes, after the prayer and the pledge, we \nwould move to the Boxer amendment, which is a post-Iraq war contracting \nmatter, and that there would be 45 minutes of debate on that \namendment--30 minutes under the control of Senator Boxer, 15 minutes \nunder the control of Senator Warner--and in keeping with the usual \nunanimous consent request for second-degree amendments that we have \ndone throughout the day; and that following that, we could move to \nperhaps the Daschle amendment, perhaps the Dodd amendment.\n  We are really getting few amendments over here. We all recognize we \nhave to dispose of the relevant amendment that Senator Murray filed \nthis afternoon. And Senator Brownback, Senator Warner, and others will \nwork on that tonight to see what is contemplated regarding that \ntomorrow.\n  So the only unanimous consent request I make tonight is that in the \nmorning we go to the Boxer amendment in keeping with the request I just \nmade.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, could I \nhave just another 3 minutes to determine if there is a problem on our \nside with that? And I regret that I could not tell you before you \nstarted.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. WARNER. Fine. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I know colleagues and others are following \nthe proceedings on the floor tonight. We have been able to achieve \nquite a good deal. As the distinguished Democratic leader mentioned, we \nwill proceed now to 12 amendments which have been cleared on both \nsides.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 792\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, on behalf of myself, I offer an amendment \nwhich realigns funds during the committee markup for the Joint \nEngineering Data Management Information and Control System from the \nNavy procurement to the Navy research development, test and evaluation \naccounts. I believe this amendment is cleared on the other side.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it is indeed cleared.\n  Mr. WARNER. I urge the Senate to adopt the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 792.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To correct the authorization of appropriations for the Joint \nEngineering Data Management Information and Control System (JEDMICS) so \n   as to be provided for in Navy RDT (PE 0603739N) instead of Navy \n                              procurement)\n\n       On page 25, between lines 11 and 12, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 213. AMOUNT FOR JOINT ENGINEERING DATA MANAGEMENT \n                   INFORMATION AND CONTROL SYSTEM.\n\n       (a) Navy RDT amount authorized to be appropriated \n     under section 201(2) is hereby increased by $2,500,000. Such \n     amount may be available for the Joint Engineering Data \n     Management Information and Control System (JEDMICS).\n       (b) Navy Procurement.--The amount authorized to be \n     appropriated under section 102(a)(4) is hereby reduced by \n     $2,500,000, to be derived from the amount provided for the \n     Joint Engineering Data Management Information and Control \n     System (JEDMICS).\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  If not, without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n\n[[Page S6834]]\n\n  The amendment (No. 792) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside for the duration of this and all other \namendments which Senator Warner and I are offering this evening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 793\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, on behalf of Senators Wyden, Collins, \nClinton, Byrd, and Lautenberg, I offer an amendment which requires a \nreport on contracting for the reconstruction of Iraq.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, this amendment has been cleared.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin], for Mr. Wyden, Ms. \n     Collins, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Byrd, and Mr. Lautenberg, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 793.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide for the reporting requirement regarding Iraq to \n  include a requirement to report noncompetitive contracting for the \n             reconstruction of the infrastructure of Iraq)\n\n       On page 273, between lines 20 and 21, insert the following:\n       (d) Reporting Requirement Relating to Noncompetitive \n     Contracting for the Reconstruction of Infrastructure of \n     Iraq.--(1) If a contract for the maintenance, rehabilitation, \n     construction, or repair of infrastructure in Iraq is entered \n     into under the oversight and direction of the Secretary of \n     Defense or the Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian \n     Assistance in the Office of the Secretary of Defense without \n     full and open competition, the Secretary shall publish in the \n     Federal Register or Commerce Business Daily and otherwise \n     make available to the public, not later than 30 days after \n     the date on which the contract is entered into, the following \n     information:\n       (i) The amount of the contract.\n       (ii) A brief description of the scope of the contract.\n       (iii) A discussion of how the executive agency identified, \n     and solicited offers from, potential contractors to perform \n     the contract, together with a list of the potential \n     contractors that were issued solicitations for the offers.\n       (iv) The justification and approval documents on which was \n     based the determination to use procedures other than \n     procedures that provide for full and open competition.\n       (B) Subparagraph (A) does not apply to a contract entered \n     into more than one year after date of enactment.\n       (2)(A) The head of an executive agency may--\n       (i) withhold from publication and disclosure under \n     paragraph (1) any document that is classified for restricted \n     access in accordance with an Executive order in the interest \n     of national defense or foreign policy; and\n       (ii) redact any part so classified that is in a document \n     not so classified before publication and disclosure of the \n     document under paragraph (1).\n       (B) In any case in which the head of an executive agency \n     withholds information under subparagraph (A), the head of \n     such executive agency shall make available an unredacted \n     version of the document containing that information to the \n     chairman and ranking member of each of the following \n     committees of Congress:\n       (i) The Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate and \n     the Committee on Government Reform of the House of \n     Representatives.\n       (ii) The Committees on Appropriations of the Senate and the \n     House of Representatives.\n       (iii) Each committee that the head of the executive agency \n     determines has legislative jurisdiction for the operations of \n     such department or agency to which the information relates.\n       (3) This subsection shall apply to contracts entered into \n     on or after October 1, 2002, except that, in the case of a \n     contract entered into before the date of the enactment of \n     this Act, paragraph (1) shall be applied as if the contract \n     had been entered into on the date of the enactment of this \n     Act.\n       (4) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as \n     affecting obligations to disclose United States Government \n     information under any other provision of law.\n       (5) In this subsection, the terms ``executive agency'' and \n     ``full and open competition'' have the meanings given such \n     terms in section 4 of the Office of Federal Procurement \n     Policy Act (41 U.S.C. 403).\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, my colleague from Oregon, Senator Wyden, \nand I have offered this amendment that will pull back the curtain on \ngovernment contracts to rebuild post-war Iraq, one of the most \nambitious reconstruction projects since World War II.\n  The government already has awarded numerous contracts towards this \npurpose. These contracts provide for an enormous scope of goods and \nservices ranging from capital construction to the administration of key \nair and sea port facilities to the rebuilding of Iraq's education and \nhealth systems. One contract even provides for such fundamentals as \nteaching local leaders about the basics of the democratic process.\n  In all, billions of Federal taxpayer dollars are being spent. It is \nCongress's job to ensure that they are spent wisely and fairly.\n  Our amendment would ensure that the basic facts regarding these and \nother contracts for the rebuilding of Iraq are publicly available. For \nthose contracts that have been awarded outside of the usual process of \nfull and open competition, our amendment would require that, within 30 \ndays of entering the contract, the contract's price, the scope of the \nwork to be performed, the contractors asked to bid, and the criteria by \nwhich they were chosen must be made known, through publication in the \nFederal Register.\n  In addition, the agency head also would need to make publicly \navailable the justification for awarding the contract on a basis less \nthan the full and open competition standard.\n  These provisions have become necessary because of the way in which \nFederal agencies contracting for goods and services in Iraq have been \nawarding these contracts.\n  Not a single Iraq reconstruction contract has been awarded on the \nbasis of ``full and open competition'' embodied in the 1984 Competition \nin Contracting Act, whereby interested parties are notified and given a \nchance to bid. The rationale for this standard was not only to provide \nbasic fairness for all potential bidders, but also to reassure the \npublic that their tax dollars were being spent wisely and in the public \ninterest.\n  Instead, these contracts have either been awarded on the basis of \nlimited competition, where the bidders are handpicked, or, in some \ncases, without any competition at all.\n  The agencies involved generally have singled out a small number of \nbidders based on the agency's preconceived notions about the bidders' \nability to perform the contract. Such a process, we are told, was \nnecessitated by the short time frame in which the contracts had to be \nplanned and awarded.\n  Such a process, however, necessarily raises questions regarding \nfundamental fairness and impartiality and whether tax money is being \nspent in a responsible manner. Because we don't have all of the facts \nregarding these contracts, speculation has arisen over their content, \ntheir price tags, and the basis of their awards.\n  For example, I was distressed to learn that a sole source contract \nentered into by the United States Army Corps of Engineers called for \nmuch more work to be performed than was initially indicated. This is \nbecause the Corps only released the information that it deemed \nrelevant. Under our amendment, the public will be able to judge for \nitself whether the government was justified in awarding a contract \nbundle on less than full competition. The public deserves no less.\n  At the same time, we have included in our amendment provisions to \nensure that classified material remains safe and is provided only to \ncongressional committees with oversight authority.\n  It is my hope that the publication of the key information in these \ncontracts will serve some of the same goals as the Competition in \nContracting Act, such as reassuring the public that reconstruction in \nIraq is being done in a fair manner and in furtherance of the public \ninterest.\n  Alternatively, keeping these justifications secret defeats the legal \nsafeguards that protect full and open competition. Further, it breeds \nwhat may be unjustified fear that the contracting process is being run \nfor the benefit of a select few rather than the Iraqi people.\n  Ensuring that this information is available to the public will help \nmaintain confidence that our work in rebuilding Iraq is being \nundertaken in a manner best calculated to advance the well-being of the \nIraqi people, and will help dispel criticisms that the process by which \nthese contracts are being awarded is unfair or unjustified.\n  I want to thank the distinguished chair and ranking member of the ASC\n\n[[Page S6835]]\n\nfor working with Senator Wyden and me on this amendment, which I \nunderstand will be made part of the manager's package.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I first want to acknowledge the hard work \ndone by the Armed Services Committee and Senator Warner and his staff \non the fiscal year 2004 defense authorization bill. Having served on \nthis committee for many years, I know how intense the discussions are \nin the committee and how difficult the decisions are when crafting a \nbill this complex and so critical. I do, however, want to engage the \nchairman on a subject of great national interest: Navy ship \nconstruction.\n  Over the years, this country has seen a steady decline in not only \nour naval ship force structure, but in the capacity to construct these \ngreat warships. Instead of building the requisite 12 ships a year to \nmaintain our current and modest naval capability, we are merely \nproducing 6 to 7 per year. The erosion in our naval capability should \nnot continue. I know this is a subject of acute interest by Chairman \nWarner, a former Secretary of the Navy, and would like to hear his \nthoughts on the issue!\n  Mr. WARNER. The level of shipbuilding is clearly of concern to me. \nThe Navy is in transition, and we find ourselves building the last of \nthe older 20th century surface combatants, submarines, aircraft \ncarriers, and amphibious assault ships and transitioning to those ships \nof the line for the 21st century. Understandably, there is a \ndevelopment period we are involved in as\n\n[[Page S6837]]\n\nwell as recapitalization. The committee chose to support the Navy's \nproposals for DDX, LCS, LHA(R), LPD and CVN-21. These are the naval \nvessels of the future.\n  Mr. BREAUX. As the Senator knows well, this transition period has a \nsubstantial impact on the shipyards and their workers who will be asked \nto construct these future vessels. After the decline in shipbuilding in \nthe last quarter century, our ability to build naval ships of all kinds \nhas been substantially reduced. During this period of transition, I am \nconcerned, as well as you, that the shipyards retain their engineers \nand workers, so they may build the next generation of ships when these \nships are mature.\n  Mr. WARNER. They key here is balance during the transition period. \nThe ongoing global war on terrorism places enormous budgetary pressure \non the Defense bills. For example, we were certainly aware that the \nLPD-17 design is in production, but at a very low rate. The committee \nsupported funding for the fiscal year 2004 ship. I also understand that \nthe Navy is attempting to accelerate production to allow procurement of \na ship in fiscal year 2005.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. The LPD-17 is certainly an excellent example of the \ndilemma posed in our Navy's shipbuilding program. I am hopeful that as \nwe move through the authorization process, some accommodation will be \nfound to move that shipbuilding program along. Certainly, this ship \nclass, if produced at greater levels can clear the decks, so to speak, \nfor the other, advanced ships, which are in development now.\n  Mr. WARNER. I acknowledge the Senator's comments and concerns.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  If not, without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 700) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN.

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to say a few words about an \namendment that I had hoped to offer to help our troops and that has \nstrong bipartisan support. But the Parliamentarian says it doesn't \nquite meet the relevance test under the consent agreement, so I will \noffer it on another day.\n  The amendment is intended to recognize the enormous contributions to \nour country by immigrants serving in the military. It gives immigrant \nmen and women in our Armed Forces more rapid naturalization, and it \nestablishes protections for their families if they are killed in \naction.\n  In all our wars, immigrants have fought side by side and given their \nlives to defend America's freedom and ideals. One out of every five \nrecipients of the Congressional Medal of Honor, the highest honor our \nNation bestows on our war heroes, has been an immigrant. Their bravery \nis unequivocal proof that immigrants are as dedicated as any other \nAmericans to defending our country.\n  Today, 37,000 men and women in the Army, Navy, Marines, Air Force, \nand Coast Guard are not yet citizens, but have the status of permanent \nresidents. Another 12,000 permanent residents are in the Reserves and \nthe National Guard. Sadly, 10 immigrant soldiers were killed in Iraq; 2 \nare missing; and 2 were POWs. The President did the right thing by \ngranting posthumous citizenship to those who died, but it is clear that \nwe can do more to ease the path to citizenship for all immigrants who \nserve in our forces.\n  My amendment improves access to naturalization for permanent \nresidents in the military and it protects spouses, children, and \nparents of soldiers killed in action by preserving their ability to \nfile for permanent residence in the United States.\n  Specifically, the amendment reduces from 3 to 2 the number of years \nrequired for these immigrants to become naturalized citizens. It \nexempts them from paying naturalization filing fees, and it enables \nthem to be naturalized while stationed abroad. Affordable and timely \nnaturalization is the least we can do for those who put their lives on \nthe line to defend our nation.\n  During times of war, recruiting needs are immediate and readiness is \nessential. Even though the war in Iraq has ended, our commitment to \nending global terrorism will continue, and more of these brave men and \nwomen will be called to active duty. Many of them are members of the \nSelected Reserve--Reserve and National Guard members who may be called \nup for active duty during a war or other national emergency. Many have \nalready been activated, and many more could be called up at a moment's \nnotice to defend our country and assist in military operations.\n\n  Over the years, Reserve and Guard units have often become full \npartners with their active-duty counterparts. Their active-duty \ncolleagues cannot go to war without them. Being a member of the \nSelected Reserves is nothing less than a continuing commitment to meet \nvery demanding standards, and they deserve recognition for their \nbravery and sacrifice. The amendment allows permanent resident members \nof\n\n[[Page S6840]]\n\nthe Selected Reserves to expedite their naturalization applications \nduring war or military hostilities.\n  Finally, the amendment provides immigration protection to immediate \nfamily members of soldiers killed in action. Grieving mothers, fathers, \nspouses, and children would be given the opportunity to legalize their \nimmigration status and avoid deportation in the event of death of their \nloved one serving in our military. We know the tragic losses endured by \nthese families, and it is unfair that they lose their immigration \nstatus as well.\n  The provisions of the amendment are identical to those in S. 922, the \nNaturalization and Family Protection for Military Members Act, which \nhas strong bipartisan support and is also endorsed by numerous veterans \norganizations including: the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Air Force \nSergeants Association, the Non-Commissioned Officers Association, and \nthe Blue Star Mothers of America.\n  The amendment is a tribute to the sacrifices that these future \nAmericans are already making now for their adopted country. They \ndeserve this important recognition and I look forward to working with \nmy colleagues to see that these provisions are enacted into law.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to express my \ndisappointment that the Senate is not able to act on my amendment to \nthe Defense Authorization bill: the NASA Workforce Flexibility Act. \nNASA and DoD have a long history of collaboration on numerous programs \nthat are central to the success of each agency and the expertise NASA \nprovides DoD is critical to our national security.\n  For over a year, NASA has been discussing with us the impending \ncrisis within their workforce. In March, my Subcommittee on Oversight \nof Government Management and the Federal Workforce held a hearing on \nthis very issue. Of great concern to me is the fact that 15 percent of \nNASA's workforce currently is eligible to retire; that number climbs to \n25 percent in just five short years. Also disconcerting is the fact \nthat scientists and engineers over age 60 outnumber those under age 30 \nby nearly three to one.\n  With so many experienced people eligible to retire in the next few \nyears, who knows how much institutional knowledge and expertise is \ngoing to walk out the door? This creates substantial risk to NASA and \nour national security.\n  During the war in Iraq, we saw some of the tremendous benefit our \nadvanced technology provides to our troops. Many people may not be \naware that NASA and DoD collaboration is central to providing for our \nnational security.\n  We have many examples in my own State of Ohio. As the former Mayor of \nCleveland and Governor of Ohio, I have seen firsthand the collaboration \nbetween the NASA Glenn Research Center in Cleveland and Wright-\nPatterson Air Force Base in Dayton.\n  In Ohio alone, NASA and DoD work together on projects that include: \nJoint fuel cell research to be used in space applications, Army use of \nGlenn Research Center expertise in testing helicopter rotor engines, \nand Navy use of Glenn Research Center expertise in missile propulsion \nprogram.\n  These joint efforts are not limited to Ohio; this collaboration \nexists nationwide. At other Centers throughout the Nation DoD depends \non NASA facilities, such as its wind tunnels, for development and \ntesting of all military aircraft, including the Joint Strike Fighter; \nDoD relies on NASA for technical assistance in investigating and \ncorrecting DoD flight problems; the National Aerospace Initiative, \nformed at the direction of the Presidential Commission on the Future of \nAerospace, is a joint DoD-NASA project to develop the future of \naerospace technology that is critical to national defense.\n  The American Helicopter Society awarded the 2002 Howard Hughes Award \nto NASA's Langley Research Center. Established in 1977, the Howard \nHughes award is given in recognition of accomplishments in the \nhelicopter industry. NASA partnered with the Army, and working in \nconjunction with academia and the private sector, developed what it \ncalls ``Tilt Rotor Aeroacoustics Code.'' This is the technology to \nreduce the noise generated by helicopter rotors.\n  My amendment addresses NASA's current and future workforce needs. It \nwould direct NASA to work with OPM and its employees to develop an \nagency-wide workforce plan.\n  In the highly competitive science and engineering fields, my \namendment would authorize NASA to offer enhanced recruitment and \nrelocation bonuses to attract and retain top talent. It also would \nallow NASA to offer a mid-career individual in the private sector a \nvacation package competitive with the private sector and comparable to \ncareer federal employees. In addition, my amendment would establish a \ncompetitive scholarship program for students in return for employment \nat NASA.\n  Mr. President, this body took remarkable action last year when it \nincluded in the creation of the Department of Homeland Security the \nfirst major governmentwide reforms to the civil service in 25 years, \nsince 1978. That was a good first step, but we have much more work to \ndo. I am concerned that human capital remains on GAO's high-risk list \nfor 2003 throughout the federal government.\n  In such a critical area as national security, it is clear that the \nDepartment of Defense needs NASA. And NASA needs workforce reform.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise today to say a few words regarding \nthe Defense Authorization Act.\n  On Saturday of last week, May 17, people all across our Nation \ncommemorated Armed Forces Day. As President Eisenhower wrote in 1953: \n``It is fitting and proper that we devote one day each year to paying \nspecial tribute to those whose constancy and courage constitute one of \nthe bulwarks guarding the freedom of this Nation and the peace of the \nfree world.''\n  I agree with that sentiment but I would also say that it is fitting \nand proper to pay tribute to the heroism and sacrifice of our brave men \nand women in the Armed Forces on each and every day.\n  We must always remember that our own freedom was not won without \ncost, but bought and paid for by the sacrifices of generations that \nhave gone before. We must take every opportunity to honor these heroes \nfor their courage and their commitment to the dream that is freedom.\n  I know I speak for the people of my State of Texas, and for all \nAmericans, when I give thanks that the operation in Iraq has recently \nreached such a swift conclusion, with so few coalition lives lost.\n  One in 10 active-duty military personnel call Texas their home, and \nas a member of the Armed Services Committee, I am dedicated to looking \nafter their interests and the interests of all of our military \npersonnel. We must ensure that the United States military has the \ntraining, the equipment, and the facilities they require to remain the \ngreatest fighting force the world has ever known, in times of war and \npeace.\n  I support this legislation because it is focused on that goal. And I \nwould like to take this opportunity to thank the distinguished Senators \nfrom Virginia and Michigan for their hard work and leadership as \nchairman and ranking member of the Armed Services Committee.\n  As members of the committee, we have recommended a $17.9 billion \nincrease above the amount appropriated by the Congress last year. This \nfunding will enhance the ability of the Department of Defense to \nfulfill its homeland defense responsibilities, and sustain the ability \nof our Armed Forces to conduct military operations with the fewest \nlives lost.\n  We also addressed a number of other defense priorities in this bill, \nincluding a 3.7 percent across-the-board pay raise for all uniformed \nservice personnel, an increase in the family separation allowance from \n$100 per month to $250 per month, and an increase in the special pay \nrate for duty in imminent danger from $150 per month to $225 per month.\n  The only area where I do want to draw some distinctions between my \nown position and the position of this bill concerns the F/A-22 \naircraft. The committee's decision to decrease funding for the F/A-22 \nRaptor by $217 million, representing two fighters, simply does not make \nsense to me.\n  The F/A-22 is our next generation fighter aircraft, and it will serve \nto replace the aging fighters currently in\n\n[[Page S6841]]\n\nour inventory. President Bush requested funding for 22 Raptors, and I \nbelieve we should fulfill that request. Reducing our funding in \nresponse to the President's budget request will only raise questions \nabout our commitment to this program, unsettle the confidence of the \nsubcontractors and suppliers, and ultimately make the entire program \nmore expensive.\n  Overall, the committee has produced a good bill. These pay raises are \nneeded and deserved. The funding provides for much-needed support for \nour military infrastructure and equipment. And I am proud to support \nthese measures.\n  I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Chairman Warner \nfor including language in the legislation which directs the Department \nof Defense to determine if any additional measures can be taken to \nassist the naturalization of qualified service members and their \nfamilies.\n  This language is consistent with the Military Citizenship Act, a bill \nthat I recently introduced, that will expedite the naturalization \nprocess for the nearly 37,000 men and women serving in our Armed Forces \nwho are not U.S. citizens. I believe there is no better way to honor \nthe heroism and sacrifice of those who serve than to offer them the \nAmerican citizenship they deserve.\n  As we labor on this bill, we should take care to remember the \nsacrifices--not just the sacrifices of the brave men and women who \nfight on the battlefield, but also the sacrifices of the families they \nleave behind.\n  I remember watching as the deployment was occurring from Camp \nLejeune, where a young mother with her child was saying goodbye to her \nhusband. I will never forget her words. She said: ``I used to think \nthat if he loved us, he would never leave us. But now I know that he is \nleaving us because he loves us.''\n  We as a grateful Nation thank the brave men and women who serve in \nuniform for the cause of freedom. We wish them all godspeed, and we \nhope and pray for their swift return to the loving arms of their \nfamilies.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the Senator \nfrom Virginia, Mr. Warner, the chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee, and the Senator from Michigan, Mr. Levin, the ranking member \nof the Armed Services Committee, for the work they have done to bring \nbefore the Senate a Defense authorization bill that will serve as a \nblueprint to ensure the U.S. Armed Forces have the resources they need \nin the upcoming fiscal year and beyond.\n  The Department of Defense faces many challenges in carrying out its \nvarious missions across the globe. This legislation authorizes critical \nfunds to make sure our troops have the weapons systems and munitions \nthey need to continue to do the outstanding work they do every day for \nour freedom, allowing for $75.6 billion in procurement funding. The \nlegislation does right by these men and women and their families by \nproviding them with a pay raise of 3.7 percent. Moreover, it mandates a \n$100 a month pay incentive for military personnel in North Korea, \nincreases the family separation allowance $150 a month, increases \nhostile fire and imminent duty pay by an additional $175 a month, and \ndoubles the death gratuity retroactive to September 11, 2001.\n  S. 1050 not only addresses the short-term needs of the military but \ngives equal consideration to the long-term challenges facing the \nservices. The $63.2 billion authorized in the bill for research and \ndevelopment is critically needed to make sure our troops will continue \nto have access to the most advanced equipment to keep them safe and one \nstep ahead of those who would do us harm. We have seen on countless \noccasions over the last several months how investments in research and \ndevelopment lead to a fighting force capable of unprecedented precision \nand mobility, which saves lives and allows for decisive military \nvictories.\n  This legislation addresses some important nonfinancial policy issues \nas well. S. 1050 strikes a balance between environmental protection and \nthe need to provide our troops with important training. It allows for \nthe examination and evaluation of weapons and countermeasure systems to \nmake sure current and future Presidents and military leaders have all \noptions available to them when making decisions pertaining to military \naction and national security. The bill also provides tens of millions \nof dollars to aid in homeland defense initiatives such as the Chemical \nand Biological Installation/Force Protection Program, and the WMD civil \nsupport teams.\n  I recognize this measure is not perfect and there are some funding \nand policy provisions on which Senators may disagree. For example, I am \nvery concerned by the committee's decision to cut the President's \nrequest for the procurement of 22 F/A-22 Raptors. Yet I know these and \nother issues will continue to be addressed by both the committee and \nthe administration as this bill moves forward and should not be cause \nto delay passage of this important piece of legislation.\n  I am pleased to support S. 1050, and I thank the chairman and ranking \nmember for their work.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, in this important debate on the Fiscal \nYear 2004 National Defense Authorization Act, I am deeply disappointed \nthat the Parliamentarian has ruled irrelevant the amendment which \nSenator Collins and I planned to offer. Our amendment would establish \nthe National Security Personnel System for the more than 700,000 \ncivilian employees of the Department of Defense. The impact of the \nparliamentarian's ruling is that the Senate will be silent on one of \nthe most substantial modifications to civil service law in the last 25 \nyears. This is most unfortunate.\n  There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that this amendment should be \nconsidered by the Senate--if for no other reason than the House of \nRepresentatives has already acted on a similar measure. Both the House \nGovernment Reform Committee and the House Armed Services Committee \napproved a version of the National Security Personnel System, and it \nwill be included in the Defense Authorization Act that the House sends \nto Conference.\n  I remind my colleagues that a new human resources management system \nfor the Department of Defense will emerge from Conference. It will be \none in which the Senate as a whole has had no voice, and the first time \nthis chamber votes on it will be during the final passage of the \nDefense Authorization Act later this year. This is regrettable.\n  I have worked on Federal Government personnel issues generally, and \nDepartment of Defense personnel issues specifically, since I arrived in \nthe Senate 4 years ago.\n  In March 2001, the Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management \nheld a hearing entitled, ``National Security Implications of the Human \nCapital Crisis.'' This hearing is just one of 13 that have been held by \nmy Subcommittee on the Federal Government's human capital challenges.\n  Among our panel of distinguished witnesses that day was former \nDefense Secretary James Schlesinger, a member of the U.S. Commission on \nNational Security in the 21st Century. Secretary Schlesinger discussed \na comprehensive evaluation on national security strategy and structure \nthat was undertaken by the Commission. Regarding human capital, the \nCommission's final report concluded:\n\n       As it enters the 21st century, the United States finds \n     itself on the brink of an unprecedented crisis of competence \n     in government. The maintenance of American power in the world \n     depends on the quality of U.S. government personnel, civil \n     and military, at all levels. We must take immediate action in \n     the personnel area to ensure that the United States can meet \n     future challenges.\n\n  Secretary Schlesinger added further:\n\n     . . . it is the Commission's view that fixing the personnel \n     problem is a precondition for fixing virtually everything \n     else that needs repair in the institutional edifice of U.S. \n     national security policy.\n\n  Just last week, my Subcommittee held a field hearing in Ohio \nentitled, ``An Overlooked Asset: the Defense Civilian Workforce.'' \nDuring this hearing, I heard testimony on the National Security \nPersonnel System from Dr. David Chu, the Under Secretary of Defense for \nPersonnel and Readiness, and the head of the U.S. General Accounting \nOffice, Comptroller General David Walker.\n  Dr. Chu testified that, ``the rigidities of the title 5 system of \npersonnel management make it difficult for our civilians to support the \nmilitary.'' He stated that the Defense Department's top three \npriorities were hiring flexibilities, reform of the compensation \nsystem, and bargaining at the national level with the Department's \nunions.\n\n[[Page S6842]]\n\n  Mr. Walker stated that ``We strongly support the concept of \nmodernizing Federal human capital policies within DOD and the Federal \nGovernment at large,'' and ``the Federal personnel system is clearly \nbroken in critical respects.'' However, he also noted that the ``senior \ncivilian and military leaders have devoted `far less' attention to \ncivilian personnel challenges than the challenges of maintaining an \neffective military,'' and that the Department needs to further develop \nand integrate its departmentwide human capital strategies.\n  But even before these hearings in which the national security \nestablishment's personnel needs were outlined so clearly, I have been \nworking to improve the management of the Defense civilian workforce. \nMany of the acute challenges confronting the Defense civilian workforce \nwere brought to my attention several years ago through conversations \nwith senior managers, both military and civilian, at Wright Patterson \nAir Force Base in Dayton, Ohio.\n  When the Senate was considering the 2001 National Defense \nAuthorization Act in June 2000, Senator DeWine and I offered an \namendment that would provide the Defense Department the ability to \nreshape its workforce through the use of early retirement and voluntary \nseparation incentives.\n  Securing passage of that relatively simple amendment was not easy. I \nworked closely with the distinguished Chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee, Senator John Warner, the distinguished Ranking Member of the \nArmed Services Committee, Senator Carl Levin, and my distinguished \ncolleague on the Armed Services Committee, Senator James Inhofe, to \nensure the adoption of that modest reform.\n  I wish the Senate had built on this earlier reform and the broader \nreforms that were included in the Homeland Security Act last year.\n  I would like to outline briefly what should be included in the \nNational Security Personnel System.\n  First, the system should feature the broad flexibilities that were \nprovided to the Department of Homeland Security. I believe that the \nlabor-management collaboration process that was mandated for that new \nDepartment, and which would be replicated for the Defense Department, \nis proving effective in ensuring employee participation in the \nestablishment of a new human resources system.\n  The Defense Department should use its flexibility to design and \nimplement a modern pay-banding and pay-for-performance system which \nemphasizes accountability, as opposed to the current system in which \nseniority and pay increases are based primarily on the passage of time.\n  In addition, the new National Security Personnel System must include \nsubstantial hiring flexibility, broad workforce reshaping authorities, \nand must grant the Department of Defense the ability to bargain with \nits unions at the national level.\n  The new system also should provide the Secretary of Defense \nadditional flexibility in hiring personnel outside of the United States \non short notice, as well as additional benefits for certain Defense \npersonnel serving abroad.\n  I support retaining the Director of the Office of Personnel \nManagement as a strategic partner with the Secretary of Defense in the \nestablishment of this new personnel system, and I do not believe that \nthe Secretary should have ``sole, unreviewable'' authority over this \nnew system.\n  The provisions I just described will give the Defense Department the \nauthority to create a modern personnel system to meet the challenges of \nthe 21st century.\n  Despite the documented need for further significant reform of the \ncivil service, and the Defense Department's concerted and diligent \nefforts in this area that culminated in the proposed National Security \nPersonnel System, the Senate apparently will take no action. Mr. \nPresident, in this regard, the United States Senate has abrogated its \nresponsibility to the civilian employees of the Department of Defense.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in favor \nof the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004 and what \nthis bill does for our national security.\n  I am honored to be the ranking member on the Subcommittee on \nStrategic Forces. I thank Senator Allard, the chairman of the \nsubcommittee, for his leadership and generous spirit of cooperation.\n  This bill accomplishes much that is good for America, and I am proud \nto have been a part of shaping the direction of our current and future \nsecurity.\n  The Strategic Forces Subcommittee has had a good year with a number \nof hearings on the difficult and complex issues that fall within the \nsubcommittee's jurisdiction. With just a few exceptions, the provisions \nin the bill on the floor today are balanced and enjoy strong bipartisan \nsupport.\n  In the space program area, an area of great interest to both Senator \nAllard and myself, I note our strong support of the additional funds \nprovided for the GPS-3 satellite.\n  The Nation cannot afford to delay the important technological \nadvances that GPS-3 will provide.\n  The Defense Department wanted to delay this program, but this year's \nbudget request was put together long before the war in Iraq.\n  Given the performance of and the demand for the precision provided by \nGPS in the war and U.S. reliance on GPS generally, the GPS-3 must be \naccelerated. Hopefully, this bill will get this vital program back on \ntrack.\n  The approach taken in the bill on missile defense is balanced. My \ncolleagues on this side of the aisle and I appreciate that this bill \naddresses a number of our concerns and incorporates some of our \nrecommendations to strengthen our missile defense programs.\n  I fully support the provision in the bill that will provide Congress \nimportant information on the funding required to actually procure, not \njust research, our missile defense systems.\n  This provision, when enacted, will provide Congress and the American \npeople a window into the costs of our missile defense plans, and will \nalso help ensure that we know up front how much funding is required to \ndeploy future missile defense systems.\n\n  I also am pleased that the bill will restore a national missile \ndefense intercept test in fiscal year 2004. The administration has \ndecided to cancel 9 of 20 previously planned intercept tests for this \nsystem. One of the cancelled tests was to have occurred in 2004.\n  This is of concern to me--I believe we need to test systems before we \ndeploy them. Restoration of the test in 2004 will substantially enhance \nour knowledge of the missile defense system the President has decided \nto field at the end of 2004. Adding this one test will increase the \nnumber of full-up tests of the system between now and the fielding date \nby 50 percent.\n  The bill also contains a requirement for the Department to report to \nCongress on why the national missile defense test plan has changed so \nradically. This is a positive step.\n  Unfortunately, the bill does not urge the administration to restore \nthe other eight cancelled tests, or require the administration to \nnotify Congress if it decides to cancel even more tests.\n  Congress has a modern tradition of using testing--developmental and \noperational--as a critical element of its constitutional oversight \nresponsibility. We should not abandon this now.\n  The President plans to field a missile defense system in 2004, yet \nthat system is still years from being fully tested and proven. When \ndeployed in 2004 it is not clear how well the system would work if \ncalled upon. Only a disciplined, fully funded, and rigorous test \nprogram will determine that.\n  During the debate on this bill, I hope we can find a way to restore \nsome of the testing unwisely removed from the program.\n  One of the areas the committee bill does not address is the lack of \nany yardstick with which to measure the developmental progress of our \nmissile defense programs. Essential management tools, common to any \ntechnology program, are not in place for missile defense.\n  With the exception of the Patriot PAC-3 program, developed mostly \nunder President Clinton, no other missile defense programs have any \nestablished standards by which to measure their progress in \ndevelopment. Are we ahead or behind schedule? Are we over, at, or under \nbudget? Is the technology ready, or is there more to learn?\n\n  How can Congress effectively meet our constitutional duty in \noversight of\n\n[[Page S6843]]\n\nthis extremely complex and expensive national effort if we do not have \nan objective, scientifically based yardstick to measure our progress?\n  Americans know that before you buy a car, you would like to know its \nfuel economy, power, load capacities, and whether it has a good \nmaintenance record. Buying a major weapon system is not different--no \nmatter how complex. Before the Department of Defense or Congress buys a \nmultibillion-dollar system, we, and the American people, should want to \nknow how well it should and does perform. For a missile defense \nprogram, this means how reliably interceptors will launch, how many \nmissiles it should be able to shoot down, how many decoys it can deal \nwith, and so on.\n  The administration has no such standards for missile defense. At this \nmoment, neither Congress nor the American people know what we are \ngetting for our money in missile defense. Even for the ``limited'' \nsystem the administration plans to field in 2004, there is no \ndescription of and commitment to the types of missiles it must or will \ndefend against, or how many decoys it can handle. I hope we can find \nsome way to develop some performance standards for our missile defense \nprogram.\n  In the area of signals intelligence, I fully support the funding \nincreases for signals intelligence aircraft. These assets have played a \ndisproportionately large role in the war on terrorism and continue to \nbe heavily utilized. It is essential that we provide the critical \nfunding to sustain and improve these important aircraft.\n  Unmanned aerial vehicles have played a remarkable role in the wars in \nAfghanistan and Iraq, as well as in the greater war on terrorism. This \nis one reason that a number of Senators from both sides of the aisle \nwere disappointed with the Navy's decision not to buy the new Fire \nScout unmanned helicopters. The Fire Scout has performed well during \nits development and holds significant promise for the future. I fully \nsupport the additional $40 million provided for Fire Scout that should \nallow production to start in 2004.\n\n  I also note my support on the provision that will focus the attention \nof the National Nuclear Security Administration's efforts to address \nthe maintenance backlog at its facilities. The Department of Energy, \nDOE, has been trapped in a death spiral of deferring maintenance for 20 \nyears. We all hope that a provision in this bill brings a new \ndedication to facilities management that ends the spiral.\n  Finally, one additional area in the bill that troubles me, and many \nof our colleagues, is its approach to nuclear weapons.\n  It appears that the Bush administration is making a significant \nchange in U.S. nuclear weapons policy by blurring the distinction \nbetween nuclear and nonnuclear weapons.\n  This blurring appears to be leading to a new and unsettling notion of \nusable nuclear weapons, a possible resumption of nuclear weapons \ntesting, and an overall approach that would lend renewed credibility \nand legitimacy to nuclear weapons at levels well below their \ntraditional strategic deterrence role. This bill supports those goals.\n  It is important that the United States maintain a strong nuclear \ndeterrent. But it is equally important for the United States to \nmaintain the longstanding policy that nuclear weapons are a weapon of \nlast resort--not just another weapon.\n  Today the United States sits firmly atop the moral high ground when \nit comes to the development and proliferation of nuclear weapons. Our \nleadership and commitment to nonproliferation is undisputed.\n  Just over the last few years, the United States has successfully \nassisted the third and fourth largest nuclear weapons states, Ukraine \nand Kazakhstan, to be signatories of the NPT as nonnuclear weapons \nstates.\n  The United States is working hard to reduce tensions and nuclear \nrisks between Pakistan and India. At the same time, we are locked in a \ntough strategic challenge over nuclear weapons in North Korea.\n  With strong leadership we can continue making progress against the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, particularly nuclear \nweapons. But we must continue to lead by example.\n  But we will fail if our leadership suggests to the world that we have \naccepted the legitimacy of nuclear weapons as a realistic tactical \noption.\n  I acknowledge that we have legitimate scientific interests in the \nreliability and effectiveness of our nuclear arsenal and new \ntechnologies that may improve safety or reduce costs. Members tend to \nagree on these research interests. But Members, and the American \npeople, tend to divide over committing the Nation to programs that will \ndevelop and deploy new weapons for purposes other than nuclear \ndeterrence.\n  We are entering dangerous territory here and must move forward \ncarefully, mindful of our global leadership, without illusions of those \nthreats that are most likely and most dangerous, and without \nideological blinders.\n  I will join with several of my colleagues later in a series of \namendments that will, if adopted, address some of these concerns. The \ndebate that lies ahead will be important to this bill and our national \nsecurity.\n  Mr. President, my thanks again to Senator Allard for his leadership \nof our subcommittee this year, and to Senators Warner and Levin for \ntheir leadership of the full committee. I look forward to the work we \nwill do together as we move this important bill to final passage.\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/21/senate-section/article/S6843-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6843]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, MAY 22, 2003\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK.

Mr. President, today I have the privilege of rising to \nsupport the Defense authorization bill. As we have seen in the recent \nconflict in Iraq and Afghanistan, the process of transforming our \nNation's military has initially met with great success. Many at home \nwill ask what is transformation and what does it mean to the future of \nour Nation's military? Simply put, transformation is a process of \nreform that will revolutionize the way the military conducts \noperations. We saw a glimpse of this emerging reality during the Iraqi \nconflict where information was gathered from a variety of sensors, \nwhether on the ground or in the air, and that information was \ntransmitted very quickly to commanders who could then exploit the \nweakness of our enemy. It was a remarkable operation and it reflects \nthe high level of competence and expertise of our Nation's service men \nand women.\n  This Defense bill will accelerate transformation and ensure that our \nforces maintain their decisive edge. It is an important accomplishment \nand the chairman, ranking Democratic member and all the members of the \ncommittee deserve our thanks. Their efforts to make military \ntransformation a reality has led them to fund the research and \ndevelopment of such revolutionary systems as the Army's Future Combat \nSystem, or FCS. FCS will allow our forces to deploy an Army brigade \nanywhere in the world within 96 hours. The DDX and the Littoral Combat \nShip will also be revolutionary in their stealth characteristics, \nautomation systems, and command and control capabilities.\n  The committee is also continuing its support for the Joint Strike \nFighter, the F-35, which will bring a stealth fighter to all of our air \nand naval/marine air forces. However, I was disappointed to see that \nthe President's request for full funding of the F/A-22 did not occur. \nThis is a system that is a transformational aircraft at its core. The \nF/A-22's supercruise engines allow for extended supersonic flight--a \nmagnitude longer than its after-burner predecessors. Using stealth \ncapabilities, the F/A-22 is able to penetrate an opponent's airspace \nand engage enemy aircraft at great ranges. Additionally, unlike our \ncurrent air superiority fighter the F-15C, the F/A-22 will be able to \nengage integrated surface-to-air missile systems. Once again using \nstealth technology, the F/A-22 will be able to approach these missile \nsites and destroy them, utilizing internally carried GPS-guided bombs. \nThe F/A-22, using this bombing capability, will also have the ability \nto track and launch attacks against ground-fixed and mobile targets. \nHowever, the truly transformational aspect of the aircraft is that it \ncan accomplish all of these missions almost simultaneously. \nParaphrasing the Air Force's motto, no aircraft comes close to the F/A-\n22's capabilities. I hope that the committee will reverse its decision \nand fully fund the President's request for 22 of these remarkable \naircraft.\n  I also want to mention my deep concern about the funding of the \nRadiation Exposure Compensation Program, RECA. The RECA program \nprovides compensation to those individuals who became ill after being \nexposed to radiation from aboverground nuclear tests or as a result of \ntheir employment in the uranium industry. In addition to creating \neligibility criteria for compensation, the RECA statute created a trust \nfund to pay claims. Two years ago, the RECA trust fund ran out of money \nand individuals whose RECA claims were approved by the Department of \nJustice were given IOUs. In response to this serious matter, we were \nable to obtain additional funding for the RECA trust fund through the \nfiscal year 2002 Department of Defense authorization legislation. This \nlegislation provided a ``capped'' appropriation for the RECA trust fund \nfrom fiscal year 2002 through fiscal year 2011.\n  Unfortunately, the Department of justice recently informed my office \nthat the capped appropriation for fiscal year 2004 will be about $28 \nmillion short and that they expect the trust fund to run out of money \nby next May. In addition, a report issued by the General Accounting \nOffice in April 2003 states that the RECA trust fund will be inadequate \nfrom fiscal year 2003 through fiscal year 2007. According to GAO, there \nwill be a shortfall of $78 million through fiscal year 2011.\n  I am deeply concerned about this funding shortfall and urge my \ncolleagues to do everything possible over the next several months in \norder to avoid this looming crisis. I do not believe it is fair that \nRECA beneficiaries, whose compensation has already been approved by the \nDepartment of Justice, could be waiting months for their compensation. \nAnd that's exactly what will happen if we do not address this situation \nin a timely manner. So I urge my colleagues to work with me as we \npursue every option to find a solution to this very serious problem.\n  There will always be some elements of disagreement in any piece of \nlegislation, but there is no disagreement that the committee continues \nto strive to compensate our Nation's service men and women for their \nhard work and dedication. Though we have a long way to go, I am pleased \nwith this year's progress and the committee's authorization of an \nacross-the-board military pay raise of 3.7 percent and an additional \ntargeted pay raise for certain experienced mid-personnel, ranging from \n5.25 percent to 6.25 percent, for an overall raise of 4.15 percent. I \nam also encouraged to see that the committee has provided for an \nincrease in the family separation to see that the committee has \nprovided for an increase in the family separation allowance from $100 \nper\n\n[[Page S6846]]\n\nmonth to $250 per month and an increase in the special pay for duty \nsubject to hostile fire or imminent danger from $150 per month to $225 \nper month.\n  I would also like to direct the Senate's attention to some for the \nunsung heroes who have played such important roles in American military \nvictories. These are the thousands of men and women who work in our \nNation's depots. They have worked tirelessly to make sure that the \nweapons, aircraft, and ammunition that our forces use are properly \nmaintained and in fantastic condition. They are the backbone of our \nmilitary force and they deserve commendation for the tremendous role \nthey have played. Appropriately, when the committee was considering \nproposals to undermine the strength of our depot system, it was the \nSenate Air Force Depot Caucus, of which I am proud to be a member, and \nSenators Inhofe, Chambliss, Bennett, and Nickles, who rose to protect \nour depots. We have so far been successful in our efforts but we \nrealize that we must be forever vigilant to protect these critical \nmilitary resources.\n  Again I would like to thank the chairman, ranking Democratic member \nand all of the members of the committee for their work on this bill. It \nwill be of great service in the support of our Nation's service men and \nwomen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/21/senate-section/article/S6846-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6846]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK.

This morning's newspaper has a story on the front page \nthat says: ``Canada Finds `Mad Cow'; U.S. Bans Beef Imports.''\n  On behalf of the beef industry in this country and consumers in this \ncountry, this begs a very important question. If Canada found a cow, \none cow, in the month of January, that was headed toward a \nslaughterhouse and subsequently killed, that now 4 months later they \nsay was infected with mad cow disease, the question is, Why does it \ntake 4 months to learn that a cow killed in January had mad cow \ndisease?\n  There are two possible reasons, it seems to me. One, there is a \nsystem by which they sent the head of this animal to England to have it \ntested and somehow it took 4 months to test it and to tell the people \nin this country and Canada there was a cow with mad cow disease killed \nin January. Four months is absurd. If that is the case, something is \nhorribly wrong. Or, second, they discovered earlier than 4 months and \ndid not disclose it.\n  I don't know which, but the Secretary of Agriculture has imposed a \nmoratorium on further shipments of beef into this country from Canada. \nThat makes good sense. I support her decision. We ship into this \ncountry from Canada 1 million head of cattle and 1 billion pounds of \nbeef. The Secretary of Agriculture is perfectly right in saying let's \nsuspend those shipments at this point. I want her to investigate, and I \nam sure they will find the answer to the question, Why did it take 4 \nmonths to learn that a cow in Canada killed in January was infected \nwith mad cow disease? That, in my judgment, is a threat to the beef \nindustry in this country, a threat to consumers everywhere.\n  There are one of two explanations, neither of which, in my judgment, \nis a good explanation. We need to get to the bottom of it on behalf of \nour beef industry and on behalf of our consumers.\n  This is not a pretty story. I don't know what the impact of this will \nbe, but as I read this and as I understand the facts, questions need to \nbe answered, and soon. I believe the Secretary of Agriculture will \npursue this matter. She says she sent some people to Canada to \ninvestigate. We demand answers. We deserve answers, the consumers and \nthe beef industry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/21/senate-section/article/S6846-3", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6846]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            SUPPORT FOR FCTC\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to commend \nU.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Tommy Thompson for his \nrecent announcement that the United States' delegation to the World \nHealth Assembly would support the Framework Convention on Tobacco \nControl, the world's first global tobacco treaty.\n  As we know, tobacco is the leading preventable cause of death in the \nworld today.\n  According to the World Health Organization almost five million people \ndie each year from tobacco related illnesses.\n  As tobacco use continues to grow at alarming rates around the world, \nthe death toll is expected to rise to 10 million people per year by \n2030, with 70 percent of these deaths occurring in developing \ncountries.\n  Clearly, we must give greater attention to the reality of the harmful \neffects of tobacco use.\n  The United States has traditionally been a world leader in tobacco \ncontrol efforts, often providing the science and expertise to \ndemonstrate the harms of tobacco and the public health efforts needed \nto reduce tobacco use.\n  As one who has long advocated for extensive tobacco control measures \nto stop the spread of tobacco use around the world, I was pleased when \nthe United States joined other WHO member states in treaty \nnegotiations.\n  These negotiations have been on-going for nearly four years.\n  As a result of that hard work, the final draft of the Framework \nConvention was overwhelmingly approved on March 1, 2003, by 171 WHO \nmember states.\n  The Framework Convention contains a wide range of provisions aimed at \ncontrolling tobacco marketing and consumption and identifies sound \npublic health policies for countries to adopt or strengthen.\n  These include two particularly strong requirements: No. 1, a \ncomprehensive ban on tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship, \nwith an exception for nations with constitutional constraints; and No. \n2, the implementation of health warning labels covering at least 30 \npercent, but ideally 50 percent or more, of the display area on tobacco \nproduct packaging.\n  In addition, the FCTC calls upon countries to ban misleading language \nthat gives the false impression that the product is less harmful than \nothers, such as ``mild,'' ``light,'' or ``low tar''; significantly \nraise tobacco taxes; provide smoke-free public spaces and workplaces; \nconsider using litigation to hold the tobacco industry liable for its \nwrongdoings.\n  Collectively, these provisions provide nations with a roadmap for \nenacting strong, science-based policies that can save lives and improve \nhealth across the world.\n  It is for these reasons that I rise today to applaud the efforts of \nSecretary Thompson and to commend him for advancing the cause of \ninternational health. He has rode to the rescue.\n  The press reports coming out of these meetings suggested the United \nStates was not going to be fully engaged and fully involved in the \ndevelopment of this important global standard related to the use of \ntobacco. Secretary Thompson arrived on the scene and came in quickly \nwith good news.\n  Only with concerted action can we avert millions of premature deaths \nand prevent future generations of young people from falling victim to \nthe tobacco epidemic.\n  The Framework Convention has brought nations of the world together to \ncombat this global epidemic.\n  But, this is the only the first step.\n  Now, it is imperative that the United States continue to play an \nactive role in the effective implementation of this treaty.\n  This begins with signing and ratifying the Framework Convention.\n  I will be working in the United States Senate to make sure we do our \npart in this process.\n  And I hope the Administration will follow the lead of Secretary \nThompson and will do their part as well.\n  I am confident that working together, we can reduce the terrible toll \nin health, lives, and money that tobacco use takes around the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/21/senate-section/article/S6846-4", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6846-S6847]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, today I would like to share an amazing \nstory of friendship--a friendship that has blossomed over the past 17 \nyears between the cities of Aalen and Dewangen, Germany, and the town \nof Webster in my home State of South Dakota.\n  In 1986, a group of wrestlers from Dewangen toured South Dakota for 3 \nweeks. During that time, local South Dakotan communities held \nexhibition matches, providing both South Dakota and this group of \nwrestlers an opportunity to display their skills and learn from each \nother.\n  Before making their final departure, the wrestlers made their final \nstop in Webster, where they were welcomed wholeheartedly. Individual \nfriendships between the wrestlers and members of the Webster community \nformed immediately. In the 17 years following their initial visit, \nmembers of the wrestling group from Aalen and Dewangen returned to \nWebster to renew their relationships with the Webster community.\n  In 1999, Webster Mayor Mike Grosek decided it was time to pay his \nfriends in Dewangen a visit. During his visit, members of the Dewangen \ncommunity talked excitedly about a possible friendship contract between \nthe two cities, and within the last 4 years informal discussions led to \nan official declaration. On April 5, a group of 16 individuals from \nWebster were on hand for the historic signing ceremony in Dewangen, and \nit is my pleasure to announce that a similar ceremony will occur in \nWebster on May 31. I am confident that the friendship forged between \nthem will endure for many years to come, and I wish to extend my \ncongratulations to all involved in making these momentous occasions \npossible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/21/senate-section/article/S6847-2", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6847]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FORD MOTOR COMPANY\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the Ford \nMotor Company on its 100th anniversary and its longstanding \nrelationship with the Commonwealth of Kentucky.\n  Ford has been an integral part of the Kentucky business community \nsince 1913 when it began building Model T automobiles in a small shop \non South Third Street in Louisville. From its modest beginnings in the \nCommonwealth, Ford rose to become a significant part of our economy. \nAfter opening additional plants in Louisville, Ford and its hard-\nworking Kentucky employees produced more than 44,000 trucks for the \nU.S. Army during World War II.\n  Following the war, Ford continued to expand in Kentucky, initiating \ncar production at the Louisville assembly plant on Fern Valley Road in \n1955. In 1969, Ford built the Kentucky truck plant on Chamberlain Lane. \nThe Kentucky truck plant would later utilize the world's most advanced \ncomputer-integrated system for manufacturing heavy truck frame rails. \nIn September 2002, the Louisville assembly plant produced the five-\nmillionth Ford Explorer.\n  Today, these two plants employ nearly 10,000 men and women in \nKentucky who, in 2002, collectively earned more than $660 million. In \n2002, the two Ford facilities paid nearly $50 million in State and \nlocal taxes. Ford and its Kentucky employees have made other important \ncontributions to local community. Last year, they donated more than \n$2.5 million to various Louisville community organizations and \nparticipated in the Adopt A Child and Sharing the Blessing programs.\n  As Ford Motor Company approaches its 100th anniversary on June 16, \n2003, I am proud to take this opportunity to congratulate the company \nand its employees for their dedication to excellence. We look forward \nto the planned expansion of the Kentucky truck plant in Louisville and \nmany more years of commitment to the people and Commonwealth of \nKentucky.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of the 100th \nanniversary of Ford Motor Company. On June 16, 1903, Henry Ford, one of \nMichigan's most famous sons, founded Ford Motor Company.\n  It is seldom in history that one person or company makes such a \ndramatic, lasting impact on society. Thomas Edison modernized the light \nbulb and changed the way we see the world. Alexander Graham Bell \ninvented the telephone, and communication was changed forever. Henry \nFord brought the automobile to the working family, and revolutionized \nmanufacturing, transportation, and everyday American life.\n  It would certainly be difficult to overestimate the importance of \nFord Motor Company on the American way of life. When it was founded, \nvirtually no one owned an automobile. The personal mobility we take for \ngranted today was unfathomable at the turn of the last century. But \nthat was to change rapidly. Within 25 years of its founding, Ford \nmanufactured more than 15 million Model T's, at a price that made them \naccessible to the working family. Today, there are over 200 million \ncars and light trucks on the road in the United States--more than 1 for \nevery licensed driver.\n  The founding of this company has become a legend. With $28,000 in \ncash, Ford and 11 associates founded what would become one of the \nworld's largest corporations. The first moving assembly line was put \ninto operation in Highland Park, MI, in 1913. This plant could produce \na complete chassis in about an hour and a half--eight times faster than \nbefore.\n  At the same time, Ford began paying his workers $5 per day--more than \ndouble the industry average wage. This high salary attracted workers to \nMichigan from around the country and the world. The influx of \nimmigrants was so great that many have called the Ford River Rouge \ncomplex the Michigan-annex of Ellis Island.\n  Henry Ford was one of the first industrialists to hire African \nAmericans. With the belief that hiring African Americans would help \nracial problems, he reached out to the Black community. By the onset of \nWorld War II, roughly half of Detroit's African-American workingmen \nwere on Ford's payroll.\n  Ford Motor Company has a long history of producing memorable \nautomobiles, from the Tin Lizzie to the Explorer. In 1954, Ford \nintroduced the Thunderbird, a symbol of postwar optimism. The Ford \nMustang, introduced in 1964, quickly became synonymous with the \nAmerican free spirit and has remained a classic American car for almost \n40 years. In 1991, the Ford Explorer defined the SUV segment of the \nmarket, and remains the best selling SUV in the world.\n  Ford's commitment to quality and innovation continues today. Ford, \nthe world's second largest automaker, will have a hybrid--part \nelectric, part gasoline powered--SUV available by 2004. Ford has also \nproduced a cutting-edge hybrid fuel cell car, and is dedicated to \nbringing hydrogen-powered vehicles to the market in the future.\n  I am proud of Ford Motor Company's accomplishments over the last 100 \nyears. I am glad Ford calls Michigan home, and I enthusiastically offer \nmy support for the resolution commemorating Ford's centennial \nanniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/21/senate-section/article/S6847-3", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6847-S6848]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Act, a bill that would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence \nof any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred in Baltimore, \nMD. In October 1998, a group of 10 people attacked Leonard ``Lynn'' \nVine, a 32-year-old native of East Baltimore, in front of his family's \nhome because of his perceived sexual orientation. Vine was shot six \ntimes, yet survived the attack. The police investigated the attack as a \nhate crime, and 20-year-old Paul Bishop was charged with attempted \nmurder.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing\n\n[[Page S6848]]\n\ncurrent law, we can change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/21/senate-section/article/S6848-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6848]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           ACTIVITIES OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS.

EVEREST\n\n Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate \nfather and son John and Jess Roskelley of Spokane, WA, for their \nsuccessful climb of Mt. Everest. The Roskelleys' achievement is both \ninspiring and historic. By reaching the summit on Wednesday, May 21, \nthe Roskelleys became the first father and son to climb the world's \nhighest mountain together. Jess also became the youngest American to \never complete the climb.\n  Throughout history, explorers and adventurers have held a special \nplace in our imaginations. Their vision and determination to explore \nuncharted territory, and to surmount overwhelming obstacles in fierce \nconditions and environments remind us of the indomitable power of the \nhuman spirit.\n  Mt. Everest has long captivated mankind as a powerful symbol of the \nawe the natural world can evoke. Since Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing \nNorgay became the first people to grace its summit 50 years ago, the \nchallenge of climbing Everest has attained an iconic status. Its \nprecipitous slopes, seemingly bottomless crevasses, and thin air are a \nreminder both of the power of natural forces, and of the fragility of \nhuman life.\n  John Roskelley is an expert climber, with 30 years experience \nclimbing in the demanding Himalayas. He is also an accomplished \nphotographer and author, whose work vividly conveys the challenges and \nemotions of high-altitude mountaineering. John is a dedicated public \nservant, as well: he serves as a Commissioner of Spokane County.\n  Jess Roskelley has clearly inherited his father's mountaineering \ntalents and taste for adventure. Though he is only 20 years old, Jess \nis already an accomplished climber in his own right. He has climbed \nWashington State's highest peak, 14,411-foot Mt. Rainier--also an \nimpressive mountaineering feat--a remarkable 35 times.\n  The Roskelleys' names will long be remembered with those of other \nmagnificent climbers from Washington State--a proud history that \nincludes such giants as Jim and Lou Whittaker, Jim Wickwire, Willi \nUnsoeld, and Ed Viesturs.\n  With their accomplishment, John and Jess Roskelley have contributed \nto this tradition, and to that of all the adventurers and explorers who \ninspire us to challenge ourselves to realize our dreams, and to \npersevere in the face of overwhelming odds. They remind us of President \nJohn F. Kennedy's affirmation that we pursue some goals ``not because \nthey are easy but because they are hard.''\n  The Roskelleys' remarkable achievement reminds us what we can \naccomplish when we set our hearts and minds upon difficult goals. I \ncongratulate them on their success, and wish them a safe trip \nhome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/21/senate-section/article/S6848-3", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6848]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                250TH BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION OF KEENE, NH\n\n Mr. GREGG. Mr President, I rise today in honor of Keene, NH, \nthe Elm City of New Hampshire. As the United States prepares to observe \nthe 227th anniversary of our independence, the citizens of Keene will \nbe celebrating the city's 250th birthday. It is therefore timely and \nappropriate that we recognize this great American community.\n  From its first settlement in the early 1700's until today, Keene has \nbeen the economic and cultural hub for the Monadnock region. The city's \nmanufacturing and commercial companies have not only energized the \nlocal economy but have made significant contributions to our country. \nThe Kingsbury Machine Tool Corporation, for example, was a key supplier \nof equipment during the Nation's involvement in World War II and the \nKorean War. The Faulkner and Colony Manufacturing Company is certainly \none of the great industrial companies in our Country's history and its \nlegacy is still being felt today. In addition to this central role as \nan economic engine, Keene has been an education leader. It is home to \nKeene State College, one of the our State's leading institutions of \nhigher learning.\n  Of course, we cannot talk about this city without praising its most \ndistinctive asset: the people of Keene. They have never been restrained \nin lending their talents and energies to any noble cause or to any \neffort that will strengthen the community's social fabric. Throughout \nits history, Keene's residents have demonstrated this commitment to \ntheir neighbors and their country. For example, upon hearing of the \nsigning of the Declaration of Independence, the town organized a \ncelebration of this great news. Unfortunately, they had no way of \naffixing the new American flag to the Liberty Pole, other than by \nclimbing to the top, which was dangerous. A 9-year-old boy stepped out \nof the crowd and offered to take up this challenge. Witnesses said as \nthe boy went higher, the pole started to bend. However, he made it and, \nas the crowd cheered, set the American Flag at the pole's highest \nreach. In February 1835, a Keene native, the Honorable John Dickson, \ndelivered the first important anti-slavery speech ever made in the \nUnited States Congress. In 1892, John Henry Elliot donated the building \nwhich became the City's first modern hospital. During the Civil War, \n584 men from Keene served; 48 gave their lives. Forty Keene residents \nfought at the Battle of Bunker Hill. Catherine Fiske opened the Young \nLadies Seminary in Keene on May 1, 1814. This was the first boarding \nschool in New Hampshire and just the second in the United States. Its \nreputation for educating the young women of Keene and of many other \nStates in the country was unmatched in its day.\n  Horatio Colony, the city's first mayor in 1874, is one of a long line \nof talented public servants from Keene who have helped make New \nHampshire such a great place to live. Today, the city is continuing \nthis honorable tradition. The long-time dean of the New Hampshire State \nSenate, Clesson ``Junie'' Blaisdell, hailed from Keene. The sitting \nmayor, Michael E.J. Blastos, has been a long-time leader here. The \ncurrent President of the New Hampshire State Senate, Tom Eaton, calls \nthe city his home. In addition to guiding one half of New Hampshire's \nlegislative body, Senator Eaton also serves as acting Governor of New \nHampshire whenever the Governor is out of state or otherwise unable to \nperform the duties of the office. Born and raised in this region of the \nState, Senator Eaton represents all that is great about the City.\n  All of these people, and their stories, illustrate the can-do \nattitude and spirit of activism of Keene's people. With that, I am \nproud to honor and salute them as they celebrate the 250th birthday of \nKeene, NH, the Elm City of the Granite State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/21/senate-section/article/S6848-4", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6848-S6849]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   TRIBUTE TO MICHIGAN'S FIRST ARMY NATIONAL GUARD BRIGADE COMMANDER\n\n Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, the contributions of women in the \nU.S. Armed Forces stretches back to the battlefields of our Revolution \nand continues in the deserts of Iraq today.\n  But those contributions have not always been recognized.\n  Today, I rise to note another milestone for women in the military and \npay tribute to COL Mandi Murray who recently became the first woman to \ncommand a brigade in Michigan's Army National Guard\n  Colonel Murray now commands the 2,433 soldiers of the 63rd Troop \nCommand based in Jackson, MI.\n\n[[Page S6849]]\n\n  The missions of the 63rd Troop Command include maintenance, \ntransportation, administration, Army aviation, and Airborne Ranger \nduties. One unit of the 63rd Troop Command is now serving in Iraq and--\nsadly--one of its servicemen was killed there last month.\n  Colonel Murray has had a remarkable career as both a civilian and an \nofficer in her 22 years with the Army National Guard.\n  She joined the Guard when she was 17. At one time she juggled full-\ntime duties as a neonatal intensive care nurse, full-time studies at \nthe University of Detroit Law School, and her obligations to the \nmilitary.\n  She is married to a fellow officer--LTC Martin Murray with the \nMichigan Army National Guard's State Area Command--and now outranks \nhim.\n  But that is not a problem for this couple.\n  ``My husband and I are truly in this as a team,'' Colonel Murray said \nrecently. ``Sometimes one has to step back for the other. He knows I \nwouldn't be here without him.''\n  The Murray's have two children, and both hold demanding full-time \ncareers. She works as a lawyer for the St. Joseph Health System, and he \nis an operations director of a 23-physician medical practice.\n  Our Nation is grateful to have such fine men and women willing to \nserve, and I am proud this couple hails from my home State.\n  Women have come a long way since 1778, when Mary Ludwig Hays--also \nknown as Molly Pitcher--manned a cannon at the Battle of Monmouth in \nplace of her wounded husband.\n  For her bravery, General George Washington made her a noncommissioned \nofficer, and for the rest of her days she was known as Sergeant Molly.\n  Now, when the armed services are called to duty, almost 200,000 women \nfrom all branches of the armed services stand ready to defend their \nNation--women like Colonel Murray.\n  I salute their bravery and their sense of duty as I do all who choose \nto wear our Nation's uniform with pride.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/21/senate-section/article/S6849-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6849]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              HONORING LIEUTENANT COLONEL ERIN M. McCARTER\n\n Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the career of \nLTC Erin M. McCarter. She has served her country in the Air Force for \nmore than 20 years and will be retiring in June.\n  Colonel McCarter grew up in Moline, IL, and was commissioned as an \nofficer in the Air Force after earning a bachelor''s degree from the \nUniversity of Iowa in 1982. She has served in various logistics \nassignments during her time in the Air Force. She was the officer \naccountable for nuclear munitions at Ellsworth AFB, SD; she served as \nwing supply and headquarters staff officer at Spangdahlem and Ramstein \nAir Bases in Germany and Shaw AFB, SC. In addition, she served as Chief \nof the Pacific Air Force's weapon system support at Hickam AFB, HI. \nFrom 1996-1997, Colonel McCarter commanded the 8th Supply Squadron at \nKunsan Air Base, Republic of South Korea. She also served as \nCongressional Liaison to Capitol Hill. Colonel McCarter assumed her \nduties managing foreign military sales to the Royal Saudi Air Force in \nSeptember 1999.\n  Colonel McCarter plans to return to her home State of Illinois upon \nher retirement. I know my fellow Senators will join me in thanking LTC \nErin McCarter for her distinguished service to her country and wish her \nwell in her future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/21/senate-section/article/S6849-2", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6849]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               IN APPRECIATION OF SISTER AUGUSTA JOHNSON\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to express my \nappreciation for Sister Augusta Johnson's many years of dedicated \nservice to the Benedictine Sisters of the Mother of God Monastery in \nWatertown, SD. Sister Johnson has recently announced she will be \nretiring after 30 years in a leadership position at Prairie Lakes \nHealthcare System.\n  Sister Johnson currently serves as vice president of administrative \nservices but began her career as the office manager at St. Ann's \nHospital before it became Prairie Lakes Hospital. During her notable \ncareer, she has also served as the controller and chief financial \nofficer of St. Ann's. When the organization was merged with Memorial \nMedical Center to form Prairie Lakes Healthcare System in 1986, Sister \nJohnson was named interim administrator. During this time, she was \nresponsible for bringing a home-based health care program called Home \nConnections to Prairie Lakes. Prior to her entrance into the health \ncare industry, Sister Johnson spent time as an elementary school \nteacher and principal in five South Dakota communities.\n  As vice president of administrative services for Prairie Lakes, \nSister Johnson serves as the administrator for Prairie Lakes Care \nCenter, the vice president overseeing the Lab, Radiology and \nEnvironmental Services Departments, and Prairie Lakes Cancer Center. \nOver her career with Prairie Lakes, she has been the organization's \nrepresentative for four major construction projects, including the \ncurrent $11 Million dollar Prairie Lakes Medical Office Building and \nhospital expansion plan.\n  After receiving her bachelor's degree in education from Mount Marty \nCollege in Yankton, SD, Sister Johnson obtained a master's degree in \nadministration from Northern State University in Aberdeen, SD. She went \non to earn a certificate in hospital administration from St. Louis \nUniversity before returning to South Dakota.\n  In addition to her countless obligations to Prairie Lakes Hospital, \nSister Johnson is one of South Dakota's two delegates to the American \nAssociation of Homes and Services for the Aging and has served on that \norganization's board of directors. In addition, she is a member of \nSioux Valley's long-term care finance task force and serves on the \nSouth Dakota Association of Healthcare Organizations Long Term Care \nCouncil.\n  I commend Sister Johnson for her selfless commitment to the service \nof others and thank her for all of the work she has done for her \ncommunity, her State, and her Nation. Her efforts have truly made a \ndifference in countless numbers of lives of people she has never even \nmet. I extend my very best wishes to her upon her retirement and \npredict that she will find peace and fulfillment in whatever lies \nahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/21/senate-section/article/S6849-3", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6849]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HONORING MISS KACEY REYNOLDS\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

Along with a \ncollege scholarship, the national scholarship recipients were rewarded \nwith a trip to Washington, DC.\n  Currently participating in Paducah Christian Homeschool, Kacey was \nrecognized earlier this year as a Focus on the Family 2003 Brio Girl of \nthe Year finalist and is a member of the National Honor Society. \nOutside of academics, she is an active teen who enjoys acting, \nrappelling, scrapbooking, and horseback riding. She hopes to study \nmusic and business management when she attends college.\n  I am pleased that Kacey takes such pride in her community and Nation. \nShe recognizes the sacrifices made by others in order to secure her \nfreedom. Respect and appreciation, as shown by Kacey, can sometimes get \npushed to the side during the daily routines of life.

THOMAS ORTHODOX \n                            CHURCH OF INDIA\n\n Mr. LEVIN, Mr. President, I would like to recognize the \nanniversary of the St. Thomas Orthodox Church of India for 25 years of \ndedication and service to my home State of Michigan and specifically \nthe Southfield and metropolitan Detroit communities.\n  St. Thomas Orthodox Church was the first Indian church established in \nSouthfield, MI. In addition to being a source of spiritual guidance, \nthe church also celebrates and preserves Indian culture and heritage in \nthe\n\n[[Page S6850]]\n\nUnited States. The church has shared its Indian heritage with the city \nof Southfield through participation in several ethnic festivals. The \nparish has also held numerous fundraisers to benefit the Missions of \nCharity, the American Red Cross, the Gujarat Earthquake Relief, and \nvarious other charities in India. In addition, St. Thomas Orthodox \nChurch has also provided service to the city of Southfield by \nparticipating in city beautification efforts.\n  The Apostle Thomas brought Christianity to the southern Indian state \nof Kerala in 52 A.D. The people of the region founded the Malankara \nOrthodox Church to maintain his teachings. During the 1970s, many \npeople from this region emigrated to the United States. Settling in the \nDetroit area, these industrious immigrants formed a congregation and \nbegan to hold prayer meetings in their homes.\n  In 1978, the Senior Metropolitan of the American Diocese, His Grace \nDr. Thomas Mar Makarios, welcomed the congregation into the Malankara \nOrthodox Church as the St. Thomas Orthodox Church of India, Detroit. \nSince then, Rev. Father Philip Jacob, vicar of the parish, has led the \ncongregation, and under his leadership the congregation has grown and \nprospered. On September 26, 1990, they bought a building of their own, \nand the congregation has grown to over 460 members.\n  I would like to commend the vicar of St. Thomas Orthodox Church, Rev. \nFather Philip Jacob, for his excellent leadership in maintaining the \nspirit and unity among the congregation. I take great pride in \nrecognizing the contributions that St. Thomas Orthodox Church has made \nto its community, and I know my colleagues will join me in saluting the \naccomplishments of St. Thomas Orthodox Church of India and in wishing \nit continued success in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/21/senate-section/article/S6850-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6850]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      COMMENDING THE PRUDENTIAL SPIRIT OF COMMUNITY AWARD HONOREES\n\n Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, today I recognize Sonide Blanchard \nand Jeffrey Lawson for being selected as two of the Nation's top youth \nvolunteers in the eighth annual Prudential Spirit of Community Awards. \nThis is an extraordinary honor. More than 24,000 young people across \nthe country were considered for this recognition this year.\n  The Prudential Spirit of Community Awards, created by Prudential \nFinancial in partnership with the National Association of Secondary \nSchool Principals, NASSP, constitutes America's largest youth \nrecognition program based exclusively on volunteerism. The awards are \ndesigned to emphasize the importance that our Nation places on service \nto others and to encourage young Americans of all backgrounds to \ncontribute to their communities.\n  Sonide Blanchard of Seaford and Jeffery Lawson of Newark have been \nselected as Delaware's top youth volunteers for 2003. As State \nHonorees, each received a $1,000 award, an engraved silver medallion \nand a trip to Washington, DC from May 3, 2003 to May 6, 2003 for the \nprogram's national recognition events. I am proud that they represented \nthe State of Delaware.\n  Seventeen-year-old Sonide, a senior at Seaford High School, devotes a \nsignificant amount of her time to tutoring Haitian students in the \nEnglish as a Second Language, ESL, program at her school. She also \nserves as a translator for both students and adults. When she was \nyounger, Sonide began translating for her mother and realized how much \nthat helped her. She soon was translating for people throughout the \nHaitian community. ``I feel that I am helping the community rise, and I \nam helping the Haitian people adapt to a new culture,'' she said. \nLater, she was inspired by her French teacher not only to translate, \nbut to tutor other students as well. She now spends 2 hours a day \nworking with ESL students to help them succeed in school despite their \nlimited English skills. Dedication and a strong sense of responsibility \nhave been key to her accomplishments.\n  Jeffrey Lawson, a 13-year-old seventh grader at St. Edmonds Academy \nin Wilmington, is a peer mentor to second-grade children who are in \nspecial education. He also volunteers with the Delaware Special \nOlympics. While attending elementary school, Jeffrey volunteered in a \nspecial education class by reading books to students and giving up his \nrecess time to mentor the children. After Jeffrey transferred to a \nprivate school, he missed the kids with whom he had worked and decided \nto go back and volunteer. Jeffrey was able to volunteer 20 days last \nyear. ``Volunteering is important because it teaches kindness and good \ncitizenship,'' said Jeffrey. He receives much of his inspiration from \nthe children he mentors.\n  Today, I rise to congratulate Sonide and Jeffrey. These two \nyoungsters are fine examples of community spirit and leadership. They \nserve as role models not only to their peers, but to all of us, as well \nas to the people they've touched through community service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/21/senate-section/article/S6850-2", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6850-S6851]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      IN MEMORY OF ISADORE LOURIE\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, last month the citizens of South \nCarolina lost a legend with the passing of Isadore Lourie, and I wish \nto recognize the most progressive lawmaker our State has ever known.\n  Izzy served three decades in the South Carolina statehouse. He came \nin 1964, right after my term as Governor was up, and back then the \nstatehouse was made up of a bunch of segregationists and right wingers. \nBut Izzy had a conscience, and he had a heart. He came in with this \npassion to turn things around for African-Americans and poor white \ncitizens, and nobody was going to stop him.\n  He led a group with Dick Riley and Joe Riley that became known as the \nYoung Turks. They backed school integration and smoothed the road for \nbringing blacks and whites together in a calm way. Then they passed \nlegislation in education, in health care, in economic development, in \nconsumer protection, and the like. They may have been up against a \nbrick wall of old-time thinking, but that didn't stop them from passing \na progressive agenda that has had a profound impact on my State.\n  This Senator will miss this very generous gentleman, and I want to \nshare our Nation's sympathy to his wife Susan, and their children and \ngrandchildren. To share with my colleagues just how much Izzy meant to \nall of us back home, I ask that this article about Izzy from The State, \nin Columbia, SC, be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                    [From the State, Apr. 26, 2003]\n\n Hundreds Say Goodbye to Beloved Legislator; Lourie Remembered as S.C. \n                 Progressive Who Fought the Good Fight\n\n                         (By Valerie Bauerlein)\n\n       Only in America, Isadore Lourie would say.\n       Only in America would the son of immigrants become one of \n     the most powerful men in a state, by knowing the law and by \n     loving justice.\n       Only in America would a freshman legislator in the \n     segregated 1960s stand up to the General Assembly's status \n     quo, and say ``enough''--if we introduce white students who \n     come to our gallery to watch justice work, we must introduce \n     black students as well.\n       And perhaps only in America--his favorite phrase--would \n     almost a thousand people arrive two hours early, park in the \n     middle of the road, and pack Beth Shalom Synagogue to say \n     goodbye to Isadore Lourie, a man who never said ``no'' to \n     someone in need, not the elderly, the poor, strangers, \n     friends.\n       Lourie, 70, died Thursday after a trying battle with \n     progressive supranuclear palsy, a rare brain disorder related \n     to Parkinson's disease. He suffered but he endured, his \n     family said at his funeral, living life throughout.\n       Three weeks ago he was spotted at his grandson Sam's \n     baseball game, screaming at the ref.\n       He was still enjoying a history class that he helped start. \n     Lourie's imagination took him back with Daniel in the lion's \n     den, Moses in Egypt.\n       ``Confined to a wheelchair, he still soared,'' said Rabbi \n     Hesh Epstein of Chabad of South Carolina, an outreach and \n     educational organization.\n       Lourie was a state House member and state senator from 1964 \n     to 1992, lauded as a progressive who forced the state forward \n     on civil rights when it preferred not to move. He authored \n     legislation on public housing, affirmative action and aging.\n       He also was a loving husband to his wife, Susan, a devoted \n     father and grandfather, and a dedicated believer.\n       ``He was a great gentleman from a great state, but let us \n     not forget, a great Jewish gentleman from a great state,'' \n     said Rabbi Philip Silverstein of Beth Shalom.\n       Lourie's sons had hoped to take him on a vacation last \n     August for his 70th birthday. He knew his time was drawing \n     short.\n       They talked of taking him somewhere special, perhaps the \n     Bahamas. But his son Lance told mourners that his father \n     preferred to stay in Columbia and come to Beth Shalom: ``He \n     said he wanted to stay here, in this room, and that's what he \n     did, and he was happy.''\n\n[[Page S6851]]\n\n       Almost a thousand people packed the synagogue, which is \n     shaped like a butterfly, with the rabbi and other speakers in \n     the center. The wings were lined with hundreds of people in \n     chairs and pews, and dozens more standing along the walls.\n       And although he was a public figure, and there were people \n     spilling out into the hallway, the funeral was an intimate, \n     almost a family, affair.\n       Isadore Lourie's three sons eulogized him, fighting sobs.\n       His oldest son, Lance, said he remembered angry phone calls \n     at the dinner table during the 1960s, when his father was \n     fighting unpopular fights.\n       ``He said, 'I will not be intimidated, and I will not be \n     bullied,' and he wouldn't,'' Lance said. ``He would not let \n     his efforts on what he thought to be right to be thwarted.''\n       He told how his father loved the phrase, ``only in \n     America,'' and what a privilege it was to have the \n     opportunity to fight for causes.\n       His middle son, Joel, said too often, people say when they \n     have lost someone that they wish they had done this or said \n     that.\n       ``My only wish is that he would not have gotten sick,'' \n     said Joel, his voice cracking. ``And we could've extended the \n     great times we had together.''\n       Joel, a state representative since 1998, said his father \n     was one of God's special servants.\n       ``I know that if not now, then soon, he will be organizing \n     and giving directions up in heaven and doing good work,'' \n     Joel said.\n       The youngest son, Neal, shared his father's law practice \n     and said he would miss his hero, his motivation, his partner, \n     and most importantly, his father.\n       ``My family used to always say that our father could hear \n     everything, no matter what he was doing,'' Neal said. That \n     was whether he was working or sleeping (and snoring), in \n     sight or out of sight.\n       ``So I say this to my dad, as he rests peacefully in God's \n     hands today, that I know he can hear me. Thank you, God bless \n     you, I love you.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/21/senate-section/article/S6851-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6851]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 3:17 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1904.

A bill to amend title 23, United States Code, to increase \nthe minimum allocation provided to States for use in carrying out \ncertain highway programs; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Highway \nFunding Equity Act of 2003. I am joined on a bipartisan basis by \nSenators Levin, Stabenow, Bayh, Lugar, Hutchison, Cornyn, Warner, \nChambliss, Lott, Lindsey Graham, Bill Nelson, Alexander, DeWine, Dole, \nCochran, Landrieu, Miller, Hollings, Breaux, and Bunning.\n  The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st century, TEA-21, \nauthorized more than $218 billion for transportation programs and will \nexpire in September 2003. TEA-21 requires certain States, known as \nDonor states, to transfer to other States a percentage of the revenue \nfrom Federal highway user fees. Several of these donor States transfer \nmore than 10 percent of every Federal highway user fee dollar to other \nStates. As a result, donor States receive a significantly lower rate-\nof-return on their transportation tax dollar being sent to Washington, \nCurrently, over 25 States, including my State of Ohio, contribute more \nmoney to the Highway Trust Fund than they receive back.\n  My State of Ohio has the Nation's 10th largest highway network, the \n5th highest volume of traffic, the 4th largest interstate highway \nnetwork, and the 2nd largest inventory of bridges in the country. Ohio \nis a major manufacturing State and is within 600 miles of 50 percent of \nthe population of North America. The interstate highways throughout \nOhio and all the donor States provide a vital link to suppliers, \nmanufacturers, distributors, and consumers.\n  Maintaining our Nation's highway infrastructure is essential to a \nrobust economy and increasing Ohio's share of Federal highway dollars \nhas been a longtime battle of mine. One of my goals when I became \ngovernor 12 years ago was to increase our rate-of-return from 79 \npercent to 87 percent in the Intermodal Surface Transportation \nEfficiency Act of 1991, ISTEA. Then, in 1998, as Chairman of the \nNational Governors Association, I lobbied Congress to increase the \nminimum rate-of-return to 90.5 percent. The goal of the Highway Funding \nEquity Act of 2003 is to increase the minimum guaranteed rate-of-return \nto 95 percent.\n  The Highway Funding Equity Act of 2003 has two components. First, the \nbill would increase the minimum guaranteed rate-of-return in TEA-21 \nfrom 90.5 percent of a State's share of contributions to the Highway \nTrust Fund to 95 percent. The Minimum Guarantee under TEA-21 includes \nall major Core highway programs: Interstate Maintenance, National \nHighway System, Bridge, Surface Transportation Program, Congestion \nMitigation and Air Quality, Metropolitan Planning, Recreational Trails, \nand any funds provided by the Minimum Guarantee itself.\n  Second, the bill uses the table of percentages now in Section 105 of \nTitle 23 to guarantee States with a population density of less the 50 \npeople per square mile a minimum rate-of-return that may exceed 95 \npercent of that State's share of Highway Account contributions. This \nprovision is intended to ensure that every State is able to provide the \nquality of road systems needed for national mobility, economic \nprosperity, and national defense. Under the 2000 Census, this provision \nwould benefit 15 states: Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, \nMaine, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oregon, \nSouth Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming.\n\n  Increasing donor States' rate of return to 95 percent will send more \nthan $60 million back to Ohio for road improvements we sorely need. The \ninterstate system was built in the 1950s to serve the demands and \ntraffic of the 1980s. Today, Ohio's infrastructure is functionally \nobsolete. Nearly every central urban interstate in Ohio is over \ncapacity and plagued with accidents and congestion. Ohio's critical \nroadways are unable to meet today's traffic demands, much less future \ntraffic which is expected to grow nearly 70 percent in the next 20 \nyears. Like all the donor States, we need these funds in Ohio.\n  States can no longer afford to support others that are already self-\nsufficient. Each State has its own needs that far outweigh total \navailable funding, especially in light of the so-called ``mega \nprojects'' coming due in the next decade. For example, the Brent Spence \nBridge that carries Interstates 71 and 75 across the Ohio River into \nKentucky is in need of replacement within the next 10 years at a cost \nof about $500 million. With the inclusion of the approach work, the \ntotal project could cost close to $1 billion.\n  The goal of this legislation is to improve the rate-of-return on \ndonor states' dollars to guarantee that federal highway program funding \nis more equitable for all states.

Mr. President, today I join Senator Voinovich in \nintroducing the Highway Funding Equity Act of 2003.\n  Our bill will allow States to get back more of what they contribute \nin gas taxes to the highway trust fund. We do this by increasing the \nFederal minimum guaranteed funding level for highways from the current \n90.5 percent of a State's share of contributions made to the Federal \nHighway Trust Fund in gas tax payments to 95 percent.\n  Increasing this minimum guarantee to 95 percent will bring us one \nstep closer to achieving fairness in the distribution of Federal \nhighway funds to States.\n  Historically about 20 States, including Michigan, known as ``donor'' \nStates, have sent more gas tax dollars to the Highway Trust Fund in \nWashington than were returned in transportation infrastructure \nspending. The remaining 30 States, known as ``donee'' States, have \nreceived more transportation funding than they paid into the Highway \nTrust Fund.\n  This came about in 1956 when a number of small States and large \nWestern States banded together to develop a formula to distribute \nFederal highway dollars that advantaged themselves over the remaining \nStates. They formed a coalition of about 30 States that would benefit \nfrom the formula and, once that formula was in place, have tenaciously \ndefended it.\n  At the beginning there was some legitimacy to the large low-\npopulation predominately Western States getting more funds than they \ncontributed to the system in order to build a national interstate \nhighway system. Some arguments remain for providing additional funds to \nthose States to maintain the national system and our bill will do that. \nHowever, there is no justification for any state getting more than its \nfair share.\n  Each time the highway bill is reauthorized the donor States that have \ntraditionally subsidized other States' road and bridge projects have \nfought to correct this inequity in highway funding. It has been a long \nstruggle to change these outdated formulas. Through these battles, some \nprogress has been made. For instance, in 1978, Michigan was getting \naround 75 cents on our gas tax dollar. The 1991 bill brought us up to \napproximately 80 cents per dollar and the 1998 bill guaranteed a 90.5 \ncent minimum return for each State.\n  We still have a long way to go to achieve fairness for Michigan and \nother States on the return on our Highway Trust Fund contributions. At \nstake are tens of millions of dollars a year in additional funding to \npay for badly needed transportation improvements in Michigan and the \njobs that go with it. According to Federal Highway Administration \ncalculations, Michigan would have received an additional $42 million in \nFY 02 under the Voinovich-Levin 95 percent minimum guarantee bill. \nThat's a critically important difference for Michigan each year. The \nsame is true for other donor States that stand to get back millions \nmore of their gas tax dollars currently being sent to other States. \nThere is no logical reason for some States to continue to send that \nmoney to other States to subsidize their road and bridge projects and \nto perpetuate this imbalance is simply unfair.\n  With the national interstate system completed, the formulas used to \ndetermine how much a State will receive from the Highway Trust Fund are \nantiquated and do not relate to what a State's real needs or \ncontributions are.\n  The Voinovich-Levin bill is consensus bill developed with the help of \ndonor State Department of Transportation agencies and their coalition \nworking group. This legislation would increase the minimum guarantee \nfrom 90.5 percent to 95 percent for all States. A companion bill is \nbeing introduced in the House today by majority leader Tom DeLay and \nRepresentative Barron Hill. With this legislation, we intend to send a \nstrong message to the authorizing committees that they should address \nthe equity issue in the Senate and House highway reauthorization bills. \nWe are determined to make progress in this bill to redistribute the \nhighway funds in a more equitable manner so that every State gets its \nfair share.\n  This is an issue of equity and we will not be satisfied until we \nachieve it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL:\n  S. 1092. A bill to authorize the establishment of a national database \nfor purposes of identifying, locating, and cataloging the many \nmemorials and permanent tributes to America's veterans; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n[[Page S6857]]\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation, the \nNational War Permanent Tribute Historical Database Act, which would \nestablish a permanent database to catalogue, identify, and locate the \nthousands of permanent veterans' memorials on public land.\n  Right now, an individual can go online and access a network of all \nrailway mainlines, railroad yards, and major sidings in the continental \nU.S. through the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. If someone wants \nto search all scenic byways--by location or keyword--he or she can \neasily access this database through the Federal Highway Administration. \nThrough the National Park Service, one can access the inventory of \nhistoric light stations and publicly accessible lighthouses.\n  But if one of my constituents, a veteran, or a young person working \non a school project, wants to access a comprehensive list of veterans' \nmemorials, they can't.\n  Currently, there is no central catalogue of information on structures \ncommemorating an individual or group in the Armed Forces available to \nthe public--maintained either by the Federal Government or by a non-\ngovernmental entity. Unfortunately, many of these structures are in a \nterrible state of disrepair and rest in unknown storage facilities \naround the country. Through the Department of Veterans' Affairs, an \nindividual can look up a list of all State cemeteries and their contact \ninformation. But, as I understand it, that's the extent of the \ndatabase. And that's simply not enough.\n  Admittedly, I am not an expert on navigating through the Internet, \nbut I know that many of my constituents are. The ultimate purpose of \nthis bill is to compile and classify the myriad of information that \nexists and make it available for anyone to access. Even those not \nproficient on a computer will benefit from a standardized database, \nbecause hopefully it will be operative from a number of means.\n  In fact, under my bill, this database would be established by the \nDepartment of the Interior with the assistance of other agencies, non-\nprofits, tribal governments, and any other entities the Secretary of \nthe Interior deem appropriate. Since the Department of the Interior \nalready maintains several databases, I believe it already has the \ninfrastructure and the proven capability to maintain a catalogue of \nveterans' memorials. The Secretary would also have to report back to \nCongress three years after enactment to assess the feasibility of \nestablishing a permanent fund to repair, maintain, and restore \nmemorials that need help.\n  Several years ago, Congress passed a law which expressed the need for \ncataloguing and maintaining these public veterans' memorials. When \nsimilar legislation, upon which this bill is based, was reported \nfavorably out of the House Committee on Resources last Congress, staff \nfrom the Congressional Budget Office estimated that enacting this bill \nwould not have a significant impact on the budgets of State, local, or \ntribal governments. It would also not preempt authority of State, \nlocal, or tribal law. Let's work together to get this common-sense, low \ncost effort off the ground and working for the millions of people who \nhave so courageously defended our freedom.\n  I have said this before, but I truly believe that veterans' memorials \noften serve as the only tangible reminders we have of their service to \nthis country. Not only have we lost many of these brave men and women \nduring conflict, we are losing thousands of them forever, each year, as \nthe veteran population ages. A common-sense first step to making sure \nthat the sites and structures honoring them are properly maintained is \nalso making sure we know where each of them is. Future generations \ndepend on it.\n  Yesterday, the House of Representatives passed another veterans' bill \nof mine, the Veterans' Memorial Preservation and Recognition Act of \n2003, which is on its way to the President's desk. This bill, S. 330, \nwould make a Federal crime, the destruction of veterans' memorials and \nwould permit guide signs to veterans' cemeteries on Federal-aid \nhighways. I cannot think of a better way to make this law more \neffective than to have a national database to identify these veterans' \nmemorials.\n  Having said that, it is my hope that we can work swiftly together to \nmove this legislation introduced today. This weekend, we will be \ncommemorating our veterans with festive celebrations and somber vigils. \nLet us honor what they have done to preserve our freedom by protecting \nand recognizing the sites which commemorate them.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1092\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``National War Permanent \n     Tribute Historical Database Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) on November 13, 2000, Congress agreed to a resolution \n     expressing the sense of Congress regarding the need for \n     cataloging and maintaining public memorials;\n       (2) there are many thousands of public memorials and \n     permanent tributes throughout the United States and abroad \n     that commemorate military conflicts of the United States and \n     the service of individuals in the Armed Forces;\n       (3) many of these memorials suffer from neglect and \n     disrepair, and many have been relocated or stored in \n     facilities where the memorials are unavailable to the public \n     and subject to further neglect and damage; and\n       (4) there exists a need to collect and centralize \n     information regarding the identification, location, and \n     description of these memorials, as no such catalog is \n     available to the public from either the Federal Government or \n     any nongovernmental entity.\n\n     SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF DATABASE.\n\n       (a) Establishment.--In order to locate, identify, and \n     catalog the many thousands of permanent tributes that \n     commemorate the military conflicts of the United States, and \n     the service and sacrifice of individuals in the Armed Forces \n     of the United States, and to make such information readily \n     available for the educational benefit of the public, the \n     Secretary of the Interior, in consultation with the Secretary \n     of Veterans Affairs, may establish and maintain a database \n     known as the National War Permanent Tribute Historical \n     Database.\n       (b) Content.--The database shall contain information on--\n       (1) the location, history, and background of the permanent \n     tributes;\n       (2) photographs and other information to enhance the \n     understanding of the permanent tributes;\n       (3) information about the veterans in whose honor the \n     permanent tributes are dedicated; and\n       (4) any other information the Secretary considers \n     appropriate and necessary.\n       (c) Public Access.--The database shall be made accessible \n     to the public, through the Internet or by other means, in a \n     format that permits the public to submit information on \n     permanent tributes for the purpose of updating and expanding \n     the database.\n       (d) Assistance.--The Secretary of the Interior may seek the \n     assistance of other Federal agencies and the States and their \n     political subdivisions, tribal governments, public or private \n     educational institutions, nonprofit organizations, and \n     individuals or other entities that the Secretary considers \n     appropriate in carrying out this Act, and may enter into \n     contracts and cooperative agreements to obtain information or \n     services that assist in the development and implementation of \n     the database.\n       (e) Definition.--As used in this section, the term \n     ``permanent tribute'' means any statue, structure, or other \n     monument on public property commemorating the service of any \n     person or persons in the Armed Forces.\n\n     SEC. 4. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary of \n     the Interior such sums as may be necessary to carry out this \n     Act.\n\n     SEC. 5. REPORT.\n\n       Within 3 years after the date of enactment of this Act, the \n     Secretary of the Interior shall transmit to Congress a report \n     assessing the efficacy and desirability of establishing a \n     permanent fund within the Treasury for the repair, \n     restoration, and maintenance of the memorials identified and \n     catalogued under section 3. The report shall include \n     recommended criteria regarding appropriate recipients of \n     expenditures from such a fund as well as proposed funding \n     mechanisms and any other information considered by the \n     Secretary to be relevant.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Mr. Wyden):\n  S. 1093. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend \nthe transportation fringe benefit to bicycle commuters; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge the many \nthousands of bicycle commuters across the Nation who, by taking part in \nNational Bike-to-Work Day on May 16, 2003, have chosen a healthy and \npollution-\n\n[[Page S6858]]\n\nfree alternative to driving to work. In recognition of the importance \nof bicycle commuting and National Bike-to-Work Month, it is my pleasure \nto be joined by my good friend, the Senator from Oregon, to introduce \nlegislation to extend the Transportation Fringe Benefit to bicycle \ncommuters. By including bicycle commuting as an eligible mode of \nalternative transportation under the Transportation Fringe Benefit, \nthis legislation will ensure that bicycle commuters will have access to \nthe benefits already available to individuals who commute by mass \ntransit and van-pool.\n  The Transportation Fringe Benefit was added to the Tax Code to give \nindividuals an incentive to use alternative modes of transportation. It \nis entirely voluntary for both employers and employees. Under current \nlaw, an employer may offer a Transportation Fringe Benefit to an \nemployee who commutes by mass transit or van-pool and count that \ncontribution as a business deduction. An employee of a participating \ncompany may choose to receive a tax-exempt benefit of $180 per month \nfor qualified parking or $100 per month for mass transit or van-pool.\n  The Bicycle Commuter Act simply adds bicycling as a qualifying \ntransportation method. This straightforward but significant addition to \nthe Transportation Fringe Benefit not only provides fairness to \ncommuters traveling by bike, but would also help achieve the broader \ngoals of the Transportation Fringe Benefit provision by encouraging \nhealthy, environmental, community-oriented commuting.\n  Consider a June 2002 study by the Texas Transportation Institute that \ndetails the growing severity of traffic congestion on our Nation's \nroadways--according to this study, commuters traveling during rush hour \nare encountering longer delays, rush hour periods themselves are \ngrowing, and more streets and highways are becoming congested. This \nrising trend of greater congestion costs both our Nation's economy and \nour environment.\n  Thankfully, there are alternatives, and that is why I am introducing \nthe Bicycle Commuter Act. According to the Bureau of Transportation \nStatistics, over 20 percent of Americans used a bicycle for \ntransportation within a 30-day study period. Combined with the fact \nthat more than 50 percent of the working population has a work commute \nof 5 miles or fewer, bicycles present an opportunity for our Nation to \nreduce problems of grid lock, air pollution, and roadway wear and tear.\n  Indeed, our Nation has made significant gains through mass transit \nand alternative transportation. However, more can and must be done--and \nI believe the Bicycle Commuter Act would be an important step in \nensuring that our Nation's transportation policies recognize the \npotential benefits to the individual and community of bicycle \ncommuting. I urge my colleagues to join myself and the Senator from \nOregon in this effort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SUNUNU (for himself, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Stevens, Mr. McCain, \n        Mrs. Lincoln, Ms. Collins, Mr. Bunning, Mr. Miller, Mr. \n        Specter, Mr. Rockefeller, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Kennedy, Ms. \n        Landrieu, Mr. Burns, and Mr. Allen):\n  S. 1095.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to \nimplement the Calfed Bay-Delta Program; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Boxer and myself, \nI rise today to introduce the Calfed Bay-Delta Authorization Act. This \nbill, an $880 million authorization, is a 33 percent match for state \nand local dollars over the next 4 years to address California's water \nneeds through a balanced program.\n  Last year's bill passed the Energy and Natural Resources Committee by \na vote of 18-5, and since that time I have worked with Republicans, \nmost notably Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona, to come up with an even \nstronger bill.\n  The result: the legislation we introduced today is greatly improved \nfrom last year's bill--it is smaller, the authorizations are more \nspecific, and it does a better job of ensuring that the CALFED program \nbe implemented in a balanced manner. Let me describe how the bill is \nimproved:\n  First, many Senators from other States were afraid CALFED was going \nto use up the Bureau of Reclamation's entire budget. To meet these \nconcerns, we have cut the authorization level, ultimately to $880 \nmillion over four years. We also limited the Federal cost-share to one-\nthird.\n  Second, some Republican Senators were afraid that environmental \nprojects not needing authorization would sail smoothly ahead, while \nstorage projects lacking Congressional approval would languish. To meet \nthis concern, we required balanced implementation. The Secretary of the \nInterior must certify annually that the CALFED program is progressing \nin a balanced manner toward achieving all of its different components.\n  Third, other Republican Senators were concerned that they had no good \nhandle on the Federal funding of the many different agencies involved \nin CALFED. We meet this concern by requiring the Office of Management \nand Budget, OMB, to prepare a cross-cut budget showing the Federal \nfunding of each of the different agencies. We also prepared a specific \nlist of the projects to be funded and how much each one would receive.\n  In my view, these changes make the bill stronger and more likely to \npass both the Senate and the House. Just as importantly, the bill \ncontinues to provide the funding necessary to implement the key \nelements of the CALFED program. In fact, the pieces of the legislation \nwork together to solve our water needs:\n  One need is water storage. I don't believe we can meet all of our \nfuture water needs without increased water storage that is \nenvironmentally benign, that if off stream and that provides \nflexibility in the system for us to increase water supply, improve \nwater quality, and enhance ecosystem restoration.\n  We must be able to take water in wet years and store it for use in \ndry years. The bill provides $102 million for planning and feasibility \nstudies for water storage projects--and an additional $77 million for \nconveyance.\n  Next is ecological restoration. This means improving fish passages, \nrestoring streams, rivers and habitats and improving water quality. The \nbill provides $100 million for ecological restoration.\n  The bill authorizes $153 million for water conservation and \nrecycling, including $84 million for desalination and water recycling \nprojects, leveraging substantial additional water supplies for \nCalifornia with relatively little Federal investment.\n  The bill would also improve water quality for drinking through \ninvestment in treatment technology demonstration projects and water \nquality improvements in the San Francisco Bay Delta, the San Joaquin \nValley, and other parts of the State.\n  I would also like to emphasize that the bill includes a grants \nprogram for local and regional communities throughout California, \nincluding the northern part of the State. The bill authorizes up to $95 \nmillion for local California communities to develop plans and projects \nto improve their water situation. This State-wide grants program is an \nexample of how the bill will benefit all Californians. The bill also \nincludes $50 million for watershed planning and assistance.\n  The bill also includes other important provisions on levee stability, \nwith $70 million, ensuring CALFED has strong supporting science, with \n$50 million, and $25 million for program management, oversight, and \ncoordination. There is also $75 million for the environmental water \naccount, which purchases available water for environmental and other \npurposes.\n  The bill also includes balance and cross-cut budget reporting \nrequirements.\n  Through the CALFED process, we have discovered that, as Californians, \nwe have many common water interests. For example, if we both conserve \nwater and build new environmentally responsible off-stream storage, \nthen we have\n\n[[Page S6860]]\n\nfound two ways to increase the supply of water for everyone's use. And \nif we make intelligent investments in ecological restoration, we can \ncontinue to use water for growing our economy while benefitting our \nenvironment at the same time.\n  CALFED emerged after years of negotiations between Californians of \ndifferent backgrounds who care about water. This bill proposes specific \nprojects for each of CALFED's basic parts--and it appropriately defines \nthe Federal role so that other states know that California is taking \nfull responsibility for its own situation.\n  It is my strong belief that the Western energy crisis is a forerunner \nto what California will soon experience with water. Just consider the \nfollowing: California has a population of over 35 million people, which \nis expected to grow to 50 million in twenty years, yet our water system \ninfrastructure was built when the State had only 16 million people.\n\n  California is the sixth largest economy in the world. It is the \nnumber one agricultural producing State in the Nation. It is the \nleading producer of agriculture products, such as dairy, wine, grapes, \nstrawberries, almonds, lettuce and tomatoes--the list goes on and on.\n  California's trade, manufacturing, and service sectors are \nsubstantial contributors to the American economy. Clearly, these \nsectors would be put at risk if there is not an adequate supply of \nwater.\n  California has more endangered species than any State except Hawaii, \nas well as the largest population.\n  To make matters worse, a recent study by the Scripps Institute of \nOceanography predicts that global warming could reduce the West's water \nsuppy by an much as 30 percent by 2050.\n  Clearly, California's water needs are tremendous; meanwhile, the last \nmajor infrastructure improvement in the state occurred in the 1970s. We \nneed to prepare for the future and we need to do so in an \nenvironmentally sensitive way. If there is one lesson to learn from \nCalifornia's damaging energy crisis, it is that time to address a \ncrisis is not while it is happening, but beforehand.\n  California is struggling to build more power plants, while also doing \neverything possible to reduce demand through increased efficiency and \nconservation. But because this started so late, we have encountered \nsome serious problems in the past two years, which is why it is even \nmore important that we fix our water problem before it, too, reaches a \ncrisis stage.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1097\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st \nCentury with respect to national corridor planning and development and \ncoordinated border infrastructure and safety; to the Committee on \nEnvironmental and Public Works.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, for the past 50 years U.S. \ntransportation policy has focused on building a system designed to meet \nthe needs of a rapidly growing population that was still expanding \nwestward. Today, I am pleased to introduce legislation that will ease \ncongestion brought on by the North American Free Trade Agreement, \nNAFTA, by reforming the Coordinate Border Infrastructure Program and \nthe National Corridor Planning and Development Program. These two \nprograms are commonly known, collectively, as the Border and Corridor \nprogram.\n  Thanks to NAFTA, more of our trade crosses international borders, and \n80 percent of that trade moves into and through the United States in \ntrucks. Since the passage of NAFTA in 1993, traffic on America's trade \ncorridors has doubled. Although this commerce has been a boon to the \nNation's economy, it has been devastating to some of the country's \ninfrastructure. With almost 80 percent of the NAFTA trade traveling \nthrough my home State of Texas, the increased volume has further \ncongested and worn out our major highways including I-35, and created \nthe need for new highways like I-69 and Ports-To-Plains. The loss of \nproductivity resulting from increased time spent in traffic, and the \ndeclining condition of critical international corridors will have the \nlong term effect of diminishing the economic benefits of NAFTA trade. \nIt is also forcing border States to bear an unfair portion of the \ninfrastructure cost.\n  In TEA-21, Congress created the Border and Corridor programs, \nintending to address the infrastructure needs generated by NAFTA trade. \nUnfortunately, funding for those discretionary programs has often been \nmisdirected to non-border states and corridors lacking international \nsignificance.\n  The Border and Corridor programs provide funds for projects on the \nborder to speed international crossings, and to provide resources to \nHigh Priority Corridors that experience increased NAFTA truck traffic. \nWith almost every state in the country having a designated High \nPriority Corridor, the limited funding was insufficient to provide any \nreal benefit where it is most needed. My legislation will reaffirm that \nonly those corridors that are carrying the burden on NAFTA trade are \neligible to receive funding.\n  Both programs are important to the goal of addressing infrastructure \nneeds resulting from NAFTA trade traffic. However, the two programs do \nnot always receive equal funding. My legislation will guarantee that \nthe Coordinated Border Infrastructure Program will receive 50 percent \nof the available funding, to ensure that border regions will have the \nresources to conduct truck and bus inspections, and inspect commercial \nvehicles rapidly enough to keep traffic moving at the border.\n  As Congress considers TEA-21 reauthorization, I will be dedicated to \nshifting the federal focus on programs that can address the critical \nneed of states that have been impacted by NAFTA trade traffic. I want \nto thank my cosponsors, including Senators Domenici, Bingaman, Kyl, and \nCornyn for recognizing the importance of restoring fairness to these \ncritical highway programs.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1099\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to restore fairness and improve the appeal of public \nservice to the Federal judiciary by improving compensation and \nbenefits, and to instill greater public confidence in the Federal \ncourts; to the Committee on the Judicary.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill with the junior \nSenator from South Carolina, Senator Graham, entitled ``Securing \nJudicial Independence Act of 2003.'' This legislation is desperately \nneeded to increase the compensation for members of the Federal bench. \nBefore I came to work in the United States Congress in 1982, I \npracticed law in my home State of Nevada. I am proud to be a lawyer, \nand I have great respect and appreciation for the practice of law and \nthose involved in the judicial process. The very reason there has been \nsuch a great deal of debate on the Senate floor regarding Federal \njudicial nominations is precisely because these positions are so \nimportant to the administration of a fair and effective legal system. \nThe individuals chosen to serve on our Federal bench make lifetime \ncommitments to public service. However, at the same time we have \nvacancies on the bench, the real pay for these jobs has declined \ndrastically. The compensation for Federal judges has diminished by 25 \npercent in the past three decades. How can we continue to attract the \n``best of the best'' when low salaries are offered for lifetime \ntenures?\n  The answer is simple. In order to continue to attract and retain the \nmost talented men and women to the Federal bench the salaries must be \nraised. Our forefathers recognized that judicial compensation was \nintricately tied to judicial independence. In 1989, Congress linked the \nsalaries of its own members to senior executives and Federal judges. As \na result, Federal judges did not receive cost of living increases for \nseveral years in the 1990s. Additionally, even the Justices of our \nhighest court, the United States Supreme Court, make far less than \nleaders of educational institutions and not-for-profit organizations. \nThus, in raising Federal judicial salaries by 25 percent and \neliminating the annual Congressional authorization of cost of living \nadjustments for Federal judges, this bill helps to secure judicial \nindependence. It restores both fairness and the appeal of public \nservice to the Federal judiciary by improving compensation. Better \ncompensation means better quality judges, and quality judges instill \ngreater public confidence in the Federal courts. Our Constitution \ncreates lifetime appointments to the Federal bench, and the men and \nwomen who accept these positions are giving up far more lucrative \ncareers. They do this based on a calling to public service and a \ndevotion to the administration and adherence of Federal laws. While the \nsalaries are not of the level these individuals could demand in the \nprivate sector, it is only fair they be adequately compensated. I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1100\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Securing Judicial \n     Independence Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. SALARY ADJUSTMENTS.\n\n       (a) Restoration of Statutory Cost of Living Adjustments.--\n     Each salary rate which is subject to adjustment under section \n     461 of title 28, United States Code, is adjusted by an \n     amount, rounded to the nearest multiple of $100 (or if midway \n     between multiples of $100, to the next higher multiple of \n     $100) equal to 25 percent of that salary rate in effect on \n     the date preceding the date of enactment of this Act.\n       (b) Effective Date.--This section shall take effect on the \n     first day of the first applicable pay period beginning on or \n     after the date of enactment of this Act.\n\n     SEC. 3. REPEAL OF ANNUAL CONGRESSIONAL AUTHORIZATION FOR COST \n                   OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT.\n\n       Section 140 of Public Law 97-92 (28 U.S.C. 461 note) is \n     repealed.\n\n     SEC. 4. SURVIVOR BENEFITS UNDER JUDICIAL SYSTEM AND OTHER \n                   SYSTEMS.\n\n       (a) Creditable Years of Service.--Section 376 of title 28, \n     United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (k)(3), by striking the colon through \n     ``this section''; and\n       (2) in subsection (r), by striking the colon through \n     ``other annuity''.\n       (b) Notification Period for Survivor Annuity Coverage.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 376 (a)(1) of title 28, United \n     States Code, is amended in the matter following subparagraph \n     (G) by striking ``six months'' and inserting ``1 year''.\n       (2) Effective date.--This subsection shall take effect on \n     the date of enactment of this Act and apply only to written \n     notifications received by the Director of the Administrative \n     Office of the United States Courts after the dates described \n     under clause (i) or (ii) in the matter following subparagraph \n     (G) of section 376 (a)(1) of title 28, United States Code.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Smith, Mr. Daschle, Mr. \n        Jeffords, Mr. Kennedy, Ms. Collins, Ms. Landrieu, Mrs. \n        Hutchison, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Corzine, Mrs. Lincoln, Ms. \n        Cantwell, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Lautenberg, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Dodd, \n        Mrs. Boxer, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. Schumer, \n        Mr. Hollings, Mr. Reed, Mr. Kerry, Ms. Mikulski, and Mr. \n        Leahy):\n  S. 1101. A bill to provide for a comprehensive Federal effort \nrelating to early detection of, treatments for, and the prevention of \ncancer, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the National \nCancer Act of 2003. I am pleased to have the support of Senators Smith, \nDaschle, Jeffords, Kennedy, Collins, Landrieu, Hutchison, Johnson, \nCorzine, Lincoln, Clinton, Cantwell, Lautenberg, Murray, Dodd, Boxer, \nStabenow, Bill Nelson, Schumer, Hollings, Reed, Kerry, Mikulski, and \nLeahy on this important piece of legislation.\n  Today, cancer is the Nation's second cause of death, trailing heart \ndisease. Over the next 30 years, however, cancer will surpass heart \ndisease and become the leading cause of death as the Baby Boomers age.\n  This bill represents a comprehensive national battle plan to re-\nenergize the Nation's war on cancer, a war that began on January 22, \n1971 when President Richard Nixon proposed to Congress that we launch a \nwar on cancer.\n  That commitment marked a critical first step. But it is clear that we \nmust take further steps to address the scourge of cancer in every \nrespect.\n  I am the Vice-Chair of the National Dialogue on Cancer--and in \ndiscussions with cancer experts from this group, it became clear to me \nthat the National Cancer Act of 1971 was out of date.\n  We are now in the genomic era, on the cusp of discoveries and cures \nthat we could only have dreamed about in 1971. The science of cancer \nhas advanced dramatically with the revolution in molecular and cellular \nbiology creating unprecedented opportunities for understanding how \ngenetics relate to cancer.\n  The explosion in knowledge about the human genome and molecular \nbiology will enable scientists to better target cancer drugs.\n  I believe that if we work smart we could find a cure for cancer in my \nlifetime.\n  Given these advances, I strongly believe that it is time to update \nthe National Cancer Act of 1971, to reflect these breakthroughs. At the \nsame time, I wanted to get input from some of the nation's foremost \ncancer experts.\n  To that end, I asked John Seffrin, CEO of the American Cancer \nSociety, and Dr. Vincent DeVita, Director of the Yale Cancer Center, to \nform a special committee of cancer experts to provide recommendations \non a national battle plan to conquer cancer.\n  The committee produced an ambitious plan, and what I have tried to do \nis take the most important components, in light of the current budget\n\n[[Page S6865]]\n\nsituation, and develop a piece of legislation that could pass the \nSenate.\n  On November 7, 2001, President George W. Bush commended the work of \nthe Committee when he wrote, ``The journey ahead will not be easy. But \n30 years ago, no one would have imagined coming as far as we have. \nWorking together, we will take the next steps necessary to defeat this \ndeadly disease.''\n  Today, I invite the President to join me again in taking these steps \nby supporting this legislation.\n  Finding a cure for cancer is a very personal goal. I lost both my \nfather and my husband to cancer. I saw its ravages firsthand, and I \nexperienced the frustrations, the difficulties, and the loneliness that \npeople suffer when a loved-one has cancer. I determined that I would do \nall I could to reduce the number of people who go through this \ndevastating experience.\n  And it is my great hope that this legislation will help do just that, \nand enable us to find a cure for cancer in my lifetime.\n  This may in fact be the most important thing I do during my time in \nthe Senate.\n  And I believe that this legislation addresses the issue in the right \nway, and I hope that my colleagues will agree.\n  The National Cancer Act of 2003 takes a multi-pronged approach to \nwinning the war against cancer. Here's what the bill will do: 1. \nAccelerate Scientific Discovery. The advances in science that I spoke \nof earlier, regarding the human genome and molecular biology, have \nproduced medications that can target the unhealthy cancer cells and \nleave healthy cells intact.\n  That is why this legislation establishes a grant program of $20 \nmillion a year, specifically for research that focuses on the \ndevelopment of a molecularly-oriented knowledge-based approach to \ncancer drug discovery and development.\n  It also includes a sense of the Senate to encourage the Federal \nGovernment to continue its investment in cancer research by staying on \ntrack to funding the NCI bypass budget.\n  NCI now funds approximately 4,500 research project grants at nearly \n600 institutions every year. This represents 28 percent of the 16,000 \ngrant proposals NCI receives. NCI scientists think funding 40 percent \nwill allow them to fund the most promising grants. Yet at 28 percent, \nit does not happen.\n  Funding basic research marks a full frontal assault on cancer--an \nassault that will lead to more breakthroughs, more treatments, and \nultimately, I believe, to a cure.\n  We now have drugs, like Gleevec for Chronic Myeloid Leukemia and \nHerceptin for breast cancer, that can target and destroy cancer cells \nwhile leaving healthy cells unharmed.\n  Patients, who were considered terminal, have taken Gleevec and were \nable to get out of their beds and leave the hospice within days of \ntreatment. After one-year of clinical trials for Gleevec, 51 out of 54 \npatients were still doing well. With 4,500 Americans diagnosed with \nChronic Myeloid Leukemia a year, the potential for this drug is \ntremendous.\n  From the Bench to the Bedside: Expanding Access to Clinical Trials. \nFirst, the bill will provide $100 million per year for new grants for \nwhat is called ``translational'' research, work that moves promising \ndrugs from the ``bench to the bedside.''\n  The purpose of this provision is to greatly accelerate the movement \nof basic research to the patient, from the ``bench to the bedside,'' so \nthat we can conduct more clinical trials.\n  Clinical trials test the safety and efficacy of drugs, devices or new \nmedical techniques. They are required for FDA approval. These trials \nrequire thousands of participating people to help determine if drugs \nare safe and effective.\n  The bill includes several steps to expand clinical trials, those \nresearch projects that require thousands of people to determine whether \nnew drugs are safe and effective.\n  Right now, there are many new drugs under development that are stuck, \nas if in a funnel, because we have not put the resources into having \nthe people-based research to test those drugs. There are approximately \n400 new drugs that are held up in the development process because the \nresources are not available to fund clinical research to test those \ndrugs.\n  For every one drug approved, 5,000 to 10,000 were initially \nconsidered. The entire process can take as long as 15 years.\n  Second, the bill will require insurers to pay the routine or non-\nresearch costs for people to participate in clinical trials, while the \ndrug sponsor would continue to pay the research costs. California \nalready requires this coverage by private insurers.\n  Third, the bill requires the National Cancer Institute to establish a \nprogram to recruit patients and doctors to participate in clinical \ntrials. Dr. Robert Comis, President of the Coalition of National Cancer \nCooperative Groups, has said that eight out of ten cancer patients do \nnot consider participating in a clinical trial. They are unaware that \nthey might have the option. He has found that physician involvement is \nkey.\n  This is why we must work to make both physicians and patients more \naware of the importance of participating.\n  Currently, only 4 to 5 percent of adult cancer patients participate \nin clinical cancer trials. But Research America polls found that 61 \npercent of Americans would participate in a clinical trial if they \ncould.\n  We should heed the example of what is called the ``pediatric model.'' \nOver 60 percent of children with cancer participate in clinical trials. \nChildren in these trials get optimal care, with an overall physician \nmanager or ``quarterback.'' The five-year survival rates for children \nwith cancer have increased significantly.\n  In the 1960s, childhood leukemia could not be cured. It was a death \nsentence. Today, 70 percent of children with acute lymphoblastic \nleukemia enter remission. This is but one example of the power and \nimportance of clinical trials. An investigational treatment yesterday \nis standard treatment today.\n  Only by injecting new funding into cancer research will we enable \ncancer researchers to conduct the trials that are necessary to bring \npromising new drugs to market.\n  3. Transforming Research Into Treatments. Scientists say we will stop \ndefining cancer by body part, like breast cancer or prostate cancer. \nBecause everyday we are understanding better the genetic basis of \ncancer and can focus drugs on molecular targets. For example, we may \nhave 50 different kinds of breast cancer, defined by their genetic \nbasis.\n  As NCI's Dr. Rabson has said, ``As we've come to understand the \nmolecular signatures of cancer cells, we can classify tumors according \nto their genetic characteristics.''\n  This means that we need to create incentives to encourage companies \nto make these targeted drugs, because as we redefine cancer, we will \nhave smaller numbers of people who have that particular kind of breast \ncancer. Companies are often reluctant to make drugs for small patient \npopulations.\n  This legislation would expand the current definition of ``orphan \ndrugs'' from ``disease and condition'' to include ``disease or \ncondition or targets and mechanisms of pathogenesis of diseases'' that \neffect a small patient population, less than 200,000. Current tax and \nmarketing incentives remain the same. With an expansion of the \ndefinition, however, more drugs could potentially qualify for this \ndesignation.\n  Beginning with Gleevec and continuing into the future, drugs will \ntarget a narrow genetic or cellular mutation.\n  While this holds great promise for patients, it also means that the \nnumber of treatments will proliferate, thereby segmenting cancer \npatients into smaller and smaller populations. In some cases, this will \nmean that pharmaceutical companies for strictly financial reasons may \nnot want to produce a given drug.\n  The impact: This will help to ensure that patients receive the \nhighest quality care, even when the number of people faced with a \nparticular type of cancer is small.\n  4. Having Enough Scientists. The bill will also create a new \ninitiative to train more cancer researchers. Specifically, it will: 1. \nPay off the medical school loans of 100 physicians who commit to spend \nat least 3 years doing cancer research; and 2. Boost the salaries of \npostdoctoral fellows from $28,000 to $45,000 per year over 5 years.\n\n[[Page S6866]]\n\n  Every year, young physicians and researchers avoid the field of \ncancer research because, frankly, they feel they can make more money \nelsewhere. This provision will help reverse that trend and add \nthousands of men and women to the front lines of the fight.\n  The physician-scientist is endangered and essential, concluded a \nJanuary 1999 study, showing that the number of first-time M.D. \napplicants for NIH research projects has been declining. The study, \npublished in Science, said, ``. . . fewer young M.D.'s are interested \nin (or perhaps prepared for) careers as independent NIH-supported \ninvestigators.''\n  Simply put, young doctors and Ph.Ds do not want to go into cancer \nresearch because they can make more money elsewhere. Graduating \nphysicians have medical school debt averaging $75,000 to $80,000. \nBecause of the low pay to be a physician-scientist, these doctors \ncannot afford to go into research.\n  Postdoctoral fellows, who conduct the bulk of day-to-day research, \nreceive pay that is neither commensurate with their education and \nskills nor adequate. To attract the best and the brightest to the field \nof cancer research, we need to pay them more than $28,000 to start.\n  The National Academy of Sciences in September 2000 called for \nincreasing their compensation.\n  5. Quality Cancer Care. All too often having cancer is a lonely and \nfrightening experience. Cancer patients have a team of doctors, from \nthe primary care physician to the radiologist to the oncologist. Yet \npatients need one doctor to be in charge.\n  During a June 16, 1999 hearing, The Institute of Medicine told the \nSenate Cancer Coalition that the care that cancer patients get is all \ntoo often just a matter of circumstance: ``. . . for many Americans \nwith cancer, there is a wide gulf between what could be construed as \nthe ideal and the reality of [Americans'] experience with cancer care . \n. . The ad hoc and fragmented cancer care system does not ensure access \nto care, lacks coordination, and is inefficient in its use of \nresources.''\n  The Institute of Medicine study on the uneven quality of health care \nsays, ``Health care today is characterized by more to know, more to \nmanage, more to watch, more to do, and more people involved in doing it \nthan at any time in the nation's history.''\n  The bill will require insurance plans to pay doctors, preferably \noncologists, to become the overall managers of patients' care, what I \ncall a ``quarterback physician,'' to be with the patient from diagnosis \nthrough treatment, to prevent the patient from being forced to navigate \nthe medical system alone.\n  I developed this concept after meeting Dr. Judy Schmidt, a solo-\npracticing oncologist from Montana. Dr. Schmidt cares for her patients \nfrom diagnosis to treatment, and she is really a model for doctors \nacross the Nation to emulate.\n  This ``quarterback physician'' would provide overall management of \nthe patient's care among all the providers. Someone would be in charge. \nThis provision could save money because good coordination can reduce \nhospitalization costs.\n  The bill authorizes grants to health centers for the development and \noperation of programs that assign patient navigators, nurses, social \nworkers, cancer survivors and patient advocates, to individuals of \nhealth disparity populations, to assist in following-up on a cancer \ndiagnosis and to help them find the appropriate services and follow-up \ncare, which includes facilitating access to health care services.\n  This program is important because many people receive unequal access \nto care. The Institute of Medicine issued a report last year called \nUnequal Treatment: Confronting Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health \nCare. This report emphasized the importance of ``providing advocates \nfor patients who can assist them in asking the appropriate questions, \nand making the necessary inquiries as they access the health are system \n. . . ''\n  Often these are patients without health insurance who are not fluent \nin English. Having a culturally appropriate ``navigator'' who will \nassist them in making appointments and understanding the services \navailable to them could help improve quality of life for minorities.\n\n  Lastly, the bill also authorizes grants through the Centers for \nDisease Control and the National Cancer Institute to monitor and \nevaluate quality cancer care, develop information concerning quality \ncancer care and monitor cancer survivorship.\n  6. Coverage of Preventive Measures. People cannot get good health \ncare if they have no way to pay for it, if insurance plans, public and \nprivate, do not cover the basics like screenings for cancer.\n  My bill will require public plans, like Medicare and Medicaid, and \nprivate insurance plans to cover four services important to good cancer \ncare: 1. Cancer screenings; 2. Genetic testing and counseling for \npeople at risk; 3. Smoking cessation counseling; and 4. Nutrition \ncounseling.\n  Access to mammograms, pelvic exams, along with reducing fat in the \ndiet and stopping smoking--all of which could be enhanced by this \nbill--can stop cancer before it is too late.\n  Because too many Americans have no way to pay for their health care \nwhen cancer strikes and because seven percent of cancer patients are \nuninsured, the bill also requires the Institute of Medicine of the \nNational Academy of Sciences to conduct a study of the feasibility and \ncost of providing Medicare coverage to individuals at any age who are \ndiagnosed with cancer and have no other way to pay for their health \ncare.\n  Medicare already covers care for people of any age who have End Stage \nRenal Disease and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Lou Gehrig's Disease. \nThis study could provide helpful guidance to the Congress.\n  Because no assault on cancer is complete without a strong cancer \nprevention component, the bill provides funds and requires the Centers \nfor Disease Control and Prevention to prepare a model state cancer \ncontrol and prevention program; expand the National Program of \nComprehensive Cancer Control plans, and to assist every state to \ndevelop a cancer prevention and control program.\n  The bill also authorizes $250 million to expand the Center for \nDisease Control and Prevention's breast and cervical cancer screening \nprogram and authorizes $50 million for CDC to begin screening programs \nfor colorectal cancer.\n  7. Bolstering the Number of Health Care Providers. Because of the \naging of the American population, we face a virtual explosion of cancer \nin the coming 30 years. The number of cases will double. But the sad \nfact is that we do not have enough nurses and other health care \nprofessionals to take care of this expected rise in cancer patients.\n  My bill will provide $100 million for loans, grants and fellowships \nto train for the full range of cancer care providers, including nurses \nfor all settings, allied health professionals, and physicians. The bill \nrequires that these applicants have the intention to get a certificate, \ndegree, or license and demonstrate a commitment to working in cancer \ncare.\n  In nursing alone--those critical people on the front line of care--\nmany experts say we face a national nursing shortage in virtually every \nsetting, which will peak in the next 10 to 15 years unless steps are \ntaken. By 2020, the RN workforce will be 20 percent short of what will \nbe needed. My home State of California ranks 50th among registered \nnurses per capita.\n  And it's not just nurses. The Health Resources Services \nAdministration says that the demand of health care professionals will \ngrow at twice the rate of other occupations.\n  Cancer is primarily a disease of aging. As the baby boomers age, \nthere will be more cancer. Cancer care is becoming more and more \ncomplex as technology improves. Skilled providers, from the nurse \nassistant to the oncologist are needed to administer the complex \ntherapies. This bill should provide some help.\n  8. Cancer Survivorship. Thanks to advances in cancer detection and \nearly diagnosis, more aggressive and effective treatments, and better \nscreening tools, about 9 million Americans--nearly one in 30--can call \nthemselves a cancer survivor. This represents 3 percent of the \npopulation.\n  Thirty years ago a cancer diagnosis was a death sentence. That is not \nthe case today. As a result, addressing a person's quality of life \npost-cancer is becoming increasingly important.\n  To give you a snapshot picture of what a typical cancer survivor \nlooks\n\n[[Page S6867]]\n\nlike: about 59 percent of cancer survivors are over the age of 65; 3 \nmillion (30 percent) were diagnosed between 5-15 years ago; and, 23 \npercent are breast cancer survivors and 17 percent are prostate cancer \nsurvivors.\n  Current statistics suggest that for individuals who receive a \ndiagnosis today, 60 percent can expect to be alive in 5 years. The 5-\nyear survival rate for children is even higher--almost 75 percent.\n  What this means is that more than half of all people, children or \nadults, diagnosed with cancer today, will become cancer survivors.\n  We've come a long way. And the survival rate for cancer will only get \nbetter as we continue to make improvements in screenings, detection, \ndiagnosis and treatment.\n  But now we face new challenges. We need to better understand what \nservices are necessary to help address the needs of people who are \nsurviving cancer.\n  This bill would do several things to help support cancer survivors.\n  First, it would codify an Office of Cancer Survivorship at NCI. Since \n1999, such an Office has been in existence but it has not been \nofficially recognized by Congress or received it's own budget.\n  This Office is crucial because it sets the research agenda at NCI on \nsurvivorship-related issues.\n  The National Cancer Institute found in 1999 that ``surviving cancer \ncan leave a host of problems in its wake. Physical, emotional, and \nfinancial hardships often persist for years after initial diagnosis and \ntreatment. Many survivors suffer decreased quality of life following \ntreatment, leading one cancer activist and survivor to say, `surviving \nis not just about a cure, but about living the rest of our lives.' ''\n  For some, long-term health problems result, for example, because a \nsurgery to remove a cancer tumor has impaired nearby organs which could \ncause additional health problems.\n  Additionally, patients who survive one cancer have almost twice the \nrisk of developing a second cancer as the general population. Almost \n100,000 people are diagnosed each year with ``second cancers.'' What \ncan be done to reduce the chance of a second diagnosis of cancer?\n  And the bill also authorizes grants through the Centers for Disease \nControl for activities including the development of a cancer \nsurveillance system to track the health status of cancer survivors, and \nthe development of a national cancer survivorship action plan.\n  For 9 years I have co-chaired the Senate Cancer Coalition. We have \nheld ten hearings on cancer. With each hearing, I become more and more \nconvinced that we can conquer cancer in my lifetime. These are the \nhighlights of the cancer battle plan.\n  It is my hope that this legislation will become the rallying cry for \nthe Cancer community.\n  Polls by Research America show that the public wants their tax \ndollars spent on medical research and that in fact people will pay more \nin taxes for more medical research.\n  Cancer impacts everyone. Everyone knows someone who has had cancer or \nwill have cancer.\n  I am thoroughly convinced that if we just marshal the resources, we \ncan conquer cancer in the 21st century. Let's begin. The road ahead is \nlong and treacherous. But if we all work together, I honestly believe \nwe can do it.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nNational Cancer Act of 2003. This bill represents the way ahead in the \nbattle against cancer, and I am proud to co-sponsor it again in the \n108th Congress.\n  Like many Americans, I have seen the battle for cancer first hand. I \nsupport this important legislation for the millions of Americans who \nhave been diagnosed with cancer and their family members. I do so also \nin honor of my mother, whom I lost to cancer in October, 2001.\n  The statistics for cancer victims can be so numbing that they lose \ntheir effect over time, but behind every number is a face and a family. \nAnd while Oregon is a small state, the pain experienced by cancer \nsufferers and their families is the same regardless of where they live.\n  Cancer kills more people in my home State of Oregon than any other \ncondition except heart disease, and as the population ages, it will \nsurpass heart disease to become the number one killer. Each year, more \nthan 18,000 new cases of cancer are diagnosed among Oregonians--about \n50 every day. On average, 19 Oregonians die of cancer every day.\n  Breast cancer is the most often diagnosed cancer in Oregon. Nine \nwomen every day hear the words, ``You have breast cancer,'' and every \nday, one family in Oregon will lose a family member to breast cancer. \nEvery three days, one child in Oregon will be diagnosed with cancer.\n  I could continue to cite statistics, but the message is clear: we \nhave worked hard to eradicate cancer, but we must do more. While little \nprogress has been made in reducing the incidence of cancer, advances \nfrom research are producing more effective treatments, allowing us to \nimprove mortality rates. The National Cancer Act of 2003 is designed to \ndo just that. It represents a comprehensive plan to speed the discovery \nand application of new cancer treatments to find cures for--and to \nprevent--cancer.\n  The bill's special provisions for additional research dollars for \ntargeted cancer drugs will directly impact the work of Brian Druker, a \nresearcher at Oregon Health and Sciences University who has worked to \ndevelop a cancer treatment and prevention drug called Gleevac. Gleevac \nis a promising new oral treatment for patients with chronic myeloid \nleukemia, CML--a rare, life-threatening form of cancer.\n  The National Cancer Act will help ensure that new and groundbreaking \ncancer treatments like Gleevac make their way from the research bench \nto the patient's bedside table faster. Currently, there are many \npromising new drugs awaiting clinical trial. Although 60 percent of \nchildren with cancer are currently participating in clinical drug \ntrials, only 4-5 percent of adult patients do the same. In order to \nsave lives, new cancer drugs must be tested and perfected.\n  The National Cancer Act will also authorize a program to help \nattract, train, and retrain health care professionals who provide \ncancer care. By offering tuition assistance in exchange for cancer \npatient care, the National Cancer Act makes a decisive step in \nlessening a Nation-wide cancer-care workforce crisis.\n  The National Cancer Act also aims to stop cancer before it starts by \nallocating significant funds to early prevention and detection efforts. \nThe bill would require that insurers pay for cancer screenings, smoking \ncessation, nutritional counseling and other preventive measures. \nAdditionally, Medicare and Medicaid would be authorized to make \npayments to cancer specialists who coordinate their patients' cancer \ncare. Coordinated care will, in turn, improve the health outcomes for \ncancer patients.\n  I am also pleased that this year the bill adds a new provision \nauthorizing the creation of a permanent office of Cancer Survivorship \nto focus research on the issues of cancer survivors. By developing a \nnew cancer surveillance system and a national cancer survivorship \naction plan, we will be better able to address the challenges affecting \nthose in recovery.\n  Cancer is not a partisan disease and we can, and should, do more to \ntreat and prevent it. I am proud to sponsor the National Cancer Act of \n2003 as a Republican, an American, and a member of the human family.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Prevention and \nRecovery of Missing Children's Act. I especially want to commend my \ncolleagues Senator Dodd and Senator Collins for their hard work on this \nimportant legislation.\n  Sex offenders prey upon the weakest and most innocent in our \nsociety--our youth--and in astonishing numbers. According to the \nNational Center for Missing and Exploited Children, 3.9 million of the \nNation's 22.3 million children between the ages of 12 and 17 have been \nseriously physically assaulted, and one in three girls and one in five \nboys are sexually abused before the age of 18. Even more troubling is \nthe fact that most sex offenders are not in our prisons. Instead, they \nremain in our communities, often targeting their next victim. To \nillustrate, among the Federal Bureau of Investigation's `Most Wanted \nFugitives' is a sex offender who allegedly sexually abused a 12-year \nold boy over a 6-year period\n\n[[Page S6868]]\n\nafter he was released from prison for previous acts of sexual abuse.\n  Time and again we see convicted pedophiles kidnapping, brutally \nraping, and in some cases, murdering young children. Too often we are \nunable to thwart such heinous acts because recidivists succeed in \nevading State registration requirements after they have been convicted \nand released from prison. We have a duty to our children to ensure that \nwe know where convicted sex offenders are at all times. We also have a \nduty to take every step to find our missing and exploited children \npromptly.\n  The Prevention and Recovery of Missing Children Act of 2003 will \nenhance our ability to track recidivists and find child victims by \nstrengthening sexual offender registration laws and missing children \nreporting requirements. This legislation (1) requires States to \nregister sexual offenders prior to their release from prison to ensure \nthat they comply with sex registration requirements; (2) requires \nStates to obtain a DNA sample, as well as a photo and fingerprints, \nfrom convicted sexual offenders; (3) requires convicted sexual \noffenders to obtain a driver's license or State identification card as \nan additional means of identification; (4) requires convicted sexual \noffenders to report any change in registration within 10 days; (5) \nrequires convicted sexual offenders to verify their registration \ninformation every 90 days; (6) makes it a felony offense to fail to \ncomply with any sexual registration requirement; and (7) strengthens \nthe missing children reporting requirements that are imposed on States.\n  It is critical that the law enforcement community be able to track \ndown known child predators and to find our missing and exploited \nchildren promptly. This legislation provides law enforcement with the \ntools they need to achieve these goals. I am committed to working with \nSenator Dodd and Senator Collins to enhance this valuable legislation \neven further.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself, Ms. Collins, and Mr. Hatch):\n  S. 1102. A bill to assist law enforcement in their efforts to recover \nmissing children and to clarify the standards for State sex offender \nregistration programs; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleague from \nMaine, Senator Collins, and my colleague from Utah, Senator Hatch, to \nintroduce the Prevention and Recovery of Missing Children Act of 2003, \nto improve the recovery of missing children and the tracking of \nconvicted sex offenders and child predators.\n  No child or parent should ever have to go through the recent nine-\nmonth ordeal of Elizabeth Smart and her family. Yet, from the sparse \ninformation we have, we know that over one million families have \nendured a similar, and sometimes far worse, trauma.\n  In only the second study of its kind, the National Incidence Studies \nof Missing, Abducted, Runaway and Throwaway Children, NISMART-2, \nestimated that 1.3 million children met the criteria for being \nclassified as missing, including runaway, from their caretakers in \n1999. It is estimated that almost 800,000 of these cases involved \nnotification to police or missing children agencies to help locate the \nchild. When a parent's worst fear for a missing child materializes, in \n91 percent of the cases the child became the victim of a homicide \nwithin 24 hours of abduction. In 74 percent of these cases, the \nhomicide occurred within 3 hours of abduction.\n  With statistics such as these, it is truly a miracle and cause for \ncelebration that Elizabeth Smart returned to her family alive and well \nnine months after her abduction.\n  We must build and expand on practices we know lead to the safe return \nof missing and abducted children. In Elizabeth's case, the family's \ncirculation of the suspect's photograph led to the capture of \nElizabeth's captor near her home community in Utah. This success story \nhighlights the importance of the recently enacted National AMBER Alert \nNetworks, which strengthens communication and notification to \nfacilitate the recovery of other abducted children.\n  As important as AMBER Alert systems are, these are but one tool in \nour arsenal against child abduction. The bill we are introducing today \nwill strengthen other tools used by law enforcement to help take every \nstep possible to find missing children as soon as possible. For \ninstance, we know now that Elizabeth's captor was already in custody in \nCalifornia during Elizabeth's ordeal. Those officials, at that time, \ndid not have in their possession information to connect him to the \nSmart case. And so, he was released.\n  It is clear from this example that accurate, up-to-date information \non missing children cases nationwide must be made available to law \nenforcement, as well. This act fosters the sharing of information about \nmissing child cases among law enforcement by requiring the entry of \nchild information into the National Crime Information Center, NCIC, \nwithin 2 hours of receipt. NCIC is a critical resource for linking \n16,000 Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies.\n  The availability of up-to-date identifying information of known child \nand sexual predators is a vital investigative tool. The women who \nsignaled police in the Elizabeth Smart case identified the captor after \nseeing his photograph on television. One of these responsible women \nnoted that it was the photograph, and not the composite sketch, that \nhelped her recognize Elizabeth's captor as he walked down the street.\n  Whether the suspect in the Smart case had a history of sexual \noffenses is unclear. But, what is clear is that we can do more to help \nlaw enforcement track and investigate individuals with a history of \nsexual offenses.\n  Over the last decade, Congress enacted several laws designed to \nimprove the tracking of convicted sex offenders and the recovery of \nmissing children, including The Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against \nChildren and Sexually Violent Offender Registration Act of 1994, \nMegan's Law of 1996, and The Pam Lychner Sex Offender Tracking and \nIdentification Act of 1996. Collectively, these acts established \nminimum standards for State sex offender registration programs and \ncreated systems to track convicted sex offenders.\n  While these current federal laws address the main features of an \neffective registry system, the discretion over registry details and \nprocedures is left up to the states. This has led to a lack of \nconsistency and wide disparities between states. For example, state \nrequirements for sex offender notification of registration changes \nrange from 1 day to 40 days, and state requirements for a sex offender \nto register an address after moving to a new state range from 48 hours \nto 70 days.\n  In addition, many States place the burden to notify changes in \nregistry information solely on the sex offender. We need to tighten \nregistry systems so that law enforcement in all states is better \nequipped to track sex offenders. This bill strengthens the registry \nfoundation for all states. It builds upon successful practices already \nin place in some States, to better protect our communities nationwide.\n  Sex offenders pose an enormous challenge for policy makers and create \nunparalleled fear among citizens. Most of their victims are children \nand youth. Two-thirds of imprisoned sex offenders report that their \nvictims were under age 18, and nearly half report that their victims \nwere ages 12 and younger.\n  The tracking of released sex offenders is critical to protecting our \nchildren. Most sex offenders are not in prison--about 60 percent of \nconvicted sex offenders are under conditional supervision in the \ncommunity--and those who are in prison often serve limited sentences. \nThis is of great concern because sex offenders, particularly if \nuntreated, are at risk of re-offending.\n  For over two years, newspapers across the country, including the \nHartford Courant, have highlighted the inadequacy of reporting \ninformation in missing child cases and tracking of convicted sex \noffenders and known child predators. One tragic example reported a \nconvicted sex offender who moved from Massachusetts to Montana, where \npolice were never contacted about his history. He brutally murdered \nseveral Montana children before he was apprehended, and was later \nlinked to 54 cases of child abduction and molestation in several \nstates.\n  In many cases, convicted sex offenders and child predators slip \nthrough law enforcement loopholes and continue to prey on children. \nWhile all 50 states have laws to create sex offender registry \ndatabases, states are unable to\n\n[[Page S6869]]\n\nadequately track these felons. For instance, in California, 33,000, or \n44 percent of registered offenders are missing; it is estimated that \nstates on average are unable to account for 24 percent of sex \noffenders.\n  Recently, the Supreme Court ruled against challenges from Alaska and \nConnecticut, and upheld current law pertaining to sexual offender \nregistries. With the support of both Congress and the highest court of \nour land, it is inconceivable to me that we now allow bookkeeping \nchallenges to deter law enforcements' ability to identify and locate \nchild predators.\n  This bill makes several important changes to improve the tracking of \nsex offenders and the recovery of missing children. The bill: modifies \nthe definition of ``minimally sufficient program'' to include: the \nregistration of all convicted sex offenders prior to release; the \ncollection of information to assist in tracking individuals, including \na DNA sample, current photograph, driver's license and vehicle \ninformation; and verification of address and employment information for \nall offenders every 90 days. Modifies penalties for non-compliance with \nregistry requirements. It provides that State programs must designate \nnon-compliance as a felony and permits the issuance of a warrant. This \nprovision is intended to encourage compliance by offenders as well as \nprovide a tool for law enforcement and prosecutors. Improves the \nchances for recovering missing children and aids law enforcement in \nsolving cases by preventing the removal of missing children from the \nNational Crime Information Center (NCIC) database. Improves the chances \nfor recovery of missing children by requiring entry of child \ninformation into the NCIC database within 2 hours.\n  We must make the tracking of convicted sex offenders and the post-\nrelease supervision of child sexual predators a higher priority. Since \nmost sex offenders are in the community, we must ensure there is \ncontinuing contact and supervision of released sex offenders. Data \nmanagement challenges are simply inexcusable reasons for not protecting \nour innocent children from crimes committed against them.\n  We have an obligation to protect our children from the abductors, sex \noffenders and sexual predators who prey on our children. I urge my \ncolleagues to join myself, Senator Collins and Senator Hatch in \nsupporting and furthering this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/21/senate-section/article/S6869-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6869-S6870]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n         SENATE RESOLUTION 151--ELIMINATING SECRET SENATE HOLDS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Lugar, and Ms. Landrieu) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non Rules and Administration:\n\n                              S.

ELIMINATING SECRET SENATE HOLDS.\n\n       Rule VII of the Standing Rules of the Senate is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n       ``7. A Senator who provides notice to party leadership of \n     his or her intention to object to proceeding to a motion or \n     matter shall disclose the notice of objection (or hold) in \n     the Congressional Record in a section reserved for such \n     notices not later than 2 session days after the date of the \n     notice.''.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I am resubmitting a Senate \nresolution to amend the Standing Rules of the United States Senate to \neliminate the practice of secret holds. I'm pleased that I am once \nagain joined by my colleague, Senator Wyden, in this effort. Senator \nWyden and I have been working together on this issue for some time and \nwe have made some progress in bringing this issue to light and having \nit addressed. Still, the problem continues to reoccur and a permanent \nsolution is needed.\n  I know many of my colleagues are well aware of the practice of \nplacing an anonymous ``hold'' on a piece of legislation or a \nnomination. Some Senators have been victims of a secret hold placed on \none of their bills and others may have used this practice.\n  Holds are not explicitly mentioned anywhere in the Senate Rules, but \nthey derive from the rules and traditions of the Senate where a single \nSenator possesses a great deal of power to derail any matter. In order \nfor the Senate to run smoothly, objections to unanimous consent \nagreements must be avoided. Essentially, a hold is a notice by a \nSenator to his or her party leader of an intention to object to \nbringing a bill or nomination to the floor for consideration. If the \nMajority Leader were to attempt to bring a matter up for consideration \ndespite an objection, the Senate would be forced to consider the motion \nto proceed, which would be subject to a filibuster. Because this kind \nof delay would paralyze the working of the Senate, holds are usually \nhonored as both a practical necessity and a senatorial courtesy.\n  A Senator might place a hold on a piece of legislation or a \nnomination because of legitimate concerns about an aspect of a bill or \na nominee. However, there is no legitimate reason why a Senator placing \na hold on a matter should remain anonymous.\n  I believe in the principle of open government. Lack of transparency \nin the public policy process leads to cynicism and distrust of public \nofficials. I would maintain that the use of secret holds damages public \nconfidence in the institution of the Senate.\n  It has been my policy to disclose in the Congressional Record any \nhold that I place on any matter in the Senate along with my reasons for \ndoing so. I know Senator Wyden does the same. I have used holds in the \npast when I thought a matter was progressing too fast and more \nquestions needed to be answered. However, I feel that my colleagues \nhave a right to know that it was Grassley that placed the hold as well \nas why I did it.\n  As a practical matter, other members of the Senate need to be made \naware of an individual senator's concerns. How else can those concerns \nbe addressed? As a matter of principle, the American people need to be \nmade aware of any action that prevents a matter from being considered \nby their elected senators.\n  Senator Wyden and I have worked twice to get a similar ban on secret \nholds included in legislation passed by the Senate. But, both times it \nwas removed in conference.\n  Then, at the beginning of the 106th Congress, Senate Leaders Lott and \nDaschle circulated a letter informing senators of a new policy \nregarding the use of holds. The Lott/Daschle letter stated, `` . . . \nall members wishing to place a hold on any legislation or executive \ncalendar business shall notify the sponsor of the legislation and the \ncommittee of jurisdiction of their concerns.''\n  This agreement was billed as marking the end of secret holds in the \nSenate. Unfortunately, this policy has not been followed consistently. \nSecret holds have continued to appear in the Senate. Last year, Senator \nWyden and I decided that we needed to continue to pursue a permanent \nchange in the Senate Rules to end this practice and we introduced a \nSenate resolution to do just that. We were later joined by Senators \nLugar and Landrieu and I was glad to have their support. We are now \nsubmitting that same measure and I am encouraged that Rules Committee \nChairman Lott has expressed interest in examining our legislation and \nthe problem of secret holds.\n  The Grassley-Wyden resolution would add a section to the Senate Rules \nrequiring that Senators make public any hold placed on a matter within \ntwo session days of notifying his or her party leadership. This change \nwill lead to more open dialogue and more constructive debate in the \nSenate.\n  Ending secret holds will make the workings of the Senate more \ntransparent. It will reduce secrecy and public cynicism along with it. \nMoreover, this reform will improve the institutional reputation of the \nSenate. I look forward to working with Chairman Lott and all my \ncolleagues to address the problem of secret holds and hopefully make \nprogress toward ending this distasteful practice once and for all.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, for seven years Senator Grassley and I have \nteamed up in a bipartisan way to champion the cause of the sunshine \nhold in the United States Senate. The sunshine hold is the less popular \nstep sister of the more commonly used ``secret'' hold.\n  Even though it is one of the Senate's most popular procedures, \nneither the sunshine nor the secret ``hold'' can be found anywhere in \nthe United States Constitution or in the Senate Rules. It\n\n[[Page S6870]]\n\nis one of the most powerful weapons that any Senator can wield in this \nbody, and in its stealth version, known as the ``secret hold,'' it is \nfar more potent and far more insidious.\n  The ``hold'' in the Senate is a lot like the seventh inning stretch \nin baseball: there is no official rule or regulation that talks about \nit, but it has been observed for so long that it has become a \ntradition.\n  Today, Senator Grassley and I are resubmitting the resolution we \nsponsored in the 107th Congress to amend the Senate Rules to require \nthat any Senator who wishes to object to a measure or matter publish \nthat objection in the Congressional Record within 48 hours. The \nresolution does not in any way limit the privilege of any Senator to \nplace a ``hold'' on a measure or matter. It is the anonymous hold that \nis so odious to the basic premise of our democratic system: that the \nexercise of power always should be accompanied by public \naccountability. Our resolution would bring the anonymous hold out of \nthe shadows of the Senate. The resolution would assure that the awesome \npower possessed by an individual Senator to stop legislation or a \nnomination should be accompanied by public accountability.\n  Beginning in 1997 and again in 1998, the United States Senate voted \nunanimously in favor of amendments Senator Grassley and I offered to \nrequire that a notice of intent to object be published in the \nCongressional Record within 48 hours. The amendments, however, never \nsurvived conference.\n  So we took our case directly to the leadership at that time, and to \ntheir credit, Tom Daschle and Trent Lott agreed it was time to make a \nchange. They recognized the significant need for more openness in the \nway the United States Senate conducts its business so Tom Daschle and \nTrent Lott sent a joint letter in February 1999, to all Senators \nsetting forth a policy requiring ``all Senators wishing to place a hold \non any legislation or executive calender business [to] notify the \nsponsor of the legislation and the committee of jurisdiction of their \nconcerns.'' The letter said that ``written notification should be \nprovided to the respective Leader stating their intentions regarding \nthe bill or nomination,'' and that ``holds placed on items by a member \nof a personal or committee staff will not be honored unless accompanied \nby a written notification from the objecting Senator by the end of the \nfollowing business day.''\n  At first, this action by the Leaders seemed to make a real \ndifference. Many Senators were more open about their holds, and staff \ncould no longer slap a hold on a bill with a quick phone call. But \nafter six to eight months, the clouds moved in on the sunshine hold and \nthe Senate began to slip back towards the old ways. Abuses of the \n``holds'' policy began to proliferate, staff-initiated holds-by-phone \nbegan anew, and it wasn't too long before legislative gridlock set in \nand the Senate seemed to have forgotten what Senators Daschle and Lott \nhad tried to do.\n  My own assessment of the situation now, which is not based on any \nscientific evidence, GAO investigation or CRS study, is that a \nsignificant number of our colleagues in the Senate have gotten the \nmessage sent by the Leaders, and have refrained from the use of secret \nholds. They inform sponsors about their objections, and do not allow \ntheir staff to place a hold without their approval. My sense is that \nthe legislative gridlock generated by secret holds may be attributed to \na relatively small number of Senate offices. The resolution we are \nsubmitting today will not be disruptive for a solid number of Senators, \nbut it will up the ante on those who may be ``chronic abusers'' of the \nLeaders' policy on holds.\n  The requirement for public notice of a hold two days after the intent \nhas been conveyed to the leadership may prove to be an inconvenience \nbut not a hardship. No Senator will ever be thrown in jail for failing \nto give public notice of a hold. Senators routinely place statements in \nthe Congressional Record recognizing the achievements of a local Boys \nand Girls Club, or congratulating a local sports team on a State \nchampionship. Surely the intent of a Senator to block the progress of \nlegislation or a nomination should be considered of equal importance.\n  I have adhered to a policy of publicly announcing my intent to object \nto a measure or matter. This practice has not been a burden or \ninconvenience. On the contrary, my experience with the public \ndisclosure of holds is that my objections are usually dealt with in an \nexpeditious manner, thereby enabling the Senate to proceed with its \nbusiness.\n  Although this is not the ``high season'' for holds, the time is not \nfar off when legislation will become bogged down in the swamp of secret \nholds. The practice of anonymous multiple or rolling holds is more akin \nto legislative guerilla warfare than to the way the Senate should \nconduct its business.\n  It is time to drain the swamp of secret holds. The resolution we \nsubmit today will be referred to the Senate Committee on Rules. It is \nmy hope that the Committee will take this resolution seriously, hold \npublic hearings on it and give it a thorough vetting.

Res. 100, the text of \nwhich is as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 100\n\n       Whereas on June 16, 1903, then 39 year-old Henry Ford and \n     11 associates, armed with little cash, some tools, a few \n     blueprints, and unbounded faith, launched the Ford Motor \n     Company by submitting incorporation papers in Lansing, \n     Michigan;\n       Whereas the Ford Motor Company began operations in a \n     leased, small converted wagon factory on a spur of the \n     Michigan Central Railroad in Detroit;\n       Whereas the first commercial automobile emerged from the \n     Ford Motor Company in 1903 and was the original 8-horsepower, \n     2-cylinder Model A vehicle with a 2-speed transmission, 28-\n     inch wheels with wooden spokes, and 3-inch tires;\n       Whereas between 1903 and 1908, Henry Ford and his engineers \n     developed numerous models named after the letters of the \n     alphabet, with some of the models being only experimental and \n     not available to the public;\n       Whereas on October 1, 1908, the Ford Motor Company \n     introduced its ``universal car'', the Model T (sometimes \n     affectionately called the ``Tin Lizzie''), which could be \n     reconfigured by buyers to move cattle, haul freight, herd \n     horses, and even mow lawns, and Ford produced 10,660 Model T \n     vehicles its first model year, an industry record;\n       Whereas the Ford Motor Company inaugurated the first \n     automotive integrated moving assembly line in 1913, changing \n     the old manner of building 1 car at a time through moving the \n     work to the worker by having parts, components, and \n     assemblers stationed at different intervals, and beginning a \n     new era of industrial progress and growth;\n       Whereas Henry Ford surprised the world in 1914 by setting \n     Ford's minimum wage at $5.00 for an 8-hour day, which \n     replaced the prior $2.34 wage for a 9-hour day and was a \n     truly great social revolution for its time;\n       Whereas also in 1914, Henry Ford, with an eye to \n     simplicity, efficiency, and affordability, ordered that the \n     Model T use black paint exclusively because it dried faster \n     than other colors, allowing cars to be built daily at a lower \n     cost, and Ford said the vehicle will be offered in ``any \n     color so long as it is black'';\n       Whereas Ford's self-contained Rouge manufacturing complex \n     on the Rouge River encompassed diverse industries, including \n     suppliers, that allowed for the complete production of \n     vehicles from raw materials processing to final assembly, was \n     an icon of the 20th century, and, with its current \n     revitalization and redevelopment, will remain an icon in the \n     21st century;\n       Whereas in 1925, the company built the first of 199 Ford \n     Tri-Motor airplanes, nicknamed the ``Tin Goose'' and the \n     ``Model T of the Air'';\n       Whereas consumer demand for more luxury and power pushed \n     aside the current model, and, on March 9, 1932, a Ford \n     vehicle with the pioneering Ford V-8 engine block cast in 1 \n     piece rolled off the production line;\n       Whereas while Ford offered only 2 automotive brands (Ford \n     and Lincoln) through 1937, due to increased competition, in \n     1938 Ford introduced the first Mercury, a car with a \n     distinctive streamlined body style, a V-8 engine with more \n     horsepower than a Ford, and hydraulic brakes, thus filling \n     the void between the low-priced Ford and the high-priced \n     Lincoln;\n       Whereas the United Automobile Workers (UAW), one of the \n     largest labor unions in the Nation, was formed in 1935 and, \n     after a rather tumultuous beginning, won acceptance by the \n     auto industry, becoming a potent and forceful leader for auto \n     workers with Ford, which built a strong relationship with the \n     union through its policies and programs;\n       Whereas, by Government decree, all civilian auto production \n     in the United States ceased on February 10, 1942, and Ford, \n     under the control of the War Production Board, produced an \n     extensive array of tanks, B-24 aircraft, armored cars, \n     amphibious craft, gliders, and other materials for the World \n     War II war effort;\n       Whereas Ford dealers rallied to aid the Ford Motor Company \n     in its postwar comeback, proving their merit as the public's \n     main point of contact with the Company;\n       Whereas on September 21, 1945, Henry Ford II assumed the \n     presidency of Ford, and on April 7, 1947, Ford's founder, \n     Henry Ford passed away;\n       Whereas a revitalized Ford met the postwar economic boom \n     with Ford's famed F-Series trucks making their debut in 1948 \n     for commercial and personal use, and the debut of the 1949 \n     Ford sedan, with the first change in a chassis since 1932 and \n     the first integration of body and fenders which would set the \n     standard for auto design in the future;\n       Whereas these new models were followed by such well-known \n     vehicles as the Mercury Turnpike Cruiser, the retractable \n     hardtop convertible Ford Skyliner, the high performing Ford \n     Thunderbird (introduced in 1955), the Ford Galaxie \n     (introduced in 1959), and the biggest success story of the \n     1960s, the Ford Mustang, which has been a part of the \n     American scene for almost 40 years;\n       Whereas in 1953, President Dwight D. Eisenhower christened \n     the new Ford Research and Engineering Center, which was a \n     milestone in the company's dedication to automotive science \n     and which houses some of the\n\n[[Page S6889]]\n\n     most modern facilities for automotive research;\n       Whereas Ford's innovation continued through the 1980s with \n     the introduction of the Ford Taurus, which was named the 1986 \n     Motor Trend Car of the Year and which resulted in a new \n     commitment to quality at Ford and in future aerodynamic \n     design trends in the industry;\n       Whereas Ford's innovation continued through the 1990s with \n     the debut in 1993 of the Ford Mondeo, European Car of the \n     Year, the redesigned 1994 Ford Mustang, and the introduction \n     in 1990 of the Ford Explorer, which defined the sport utility \n     vehicle (SUV) segment and remains the best selling SUV in the \n     world;\n       Whereas as the 21st century begins, Ford continues its \n     marvelous record for fine products with the best-selling car \n     in the world, the Ford Focus, and the best-selling truck in \n     the world, the Ford F-Series;\n       Whereas the Ford Motor Company is the world's second \n     largest automaker and includes Ford, Lincoln, Mercury, Aston \n     Martin, Jaguar, Land Rover, Volvo, and Mazda automotive \n     brands, as well as diversified subsidiaries in finance and \n     other domestic and international business areas; and\n       Whereas on October 30, 2001, William Clay Ford, Jr., the \n     great-grandson of Henry Ford, became Chairman and Chief \n     Executive Officer of Ford Motor Company, and as such is \n     concentrating on the fundamentals that have powered the \n     company to greatness over the last century and made it a \n     world-class auto and truck manufacturer, and that will \n     continue to carry the company through the 21st century with \n     even better products and innovations: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes--\n       (A) the 100th anniversary year of the founding of the Ford \n     Motor Company, which has been a significant part of the \n     social, economic, and cultural heritage of the United States \n     and many other nations, and a revolutionary industrial and \n     global institution; and\n       (B) the truly wondrous achievements of the Ford Motor \n     Company, as its employees, retirees, suppliers, dealers, its \n     many customers, automotive enthusiasts, and friends worldwide \n     commemorate and celebrate its 100th anniversary milestone on \n     June 16, 2003;\n       (2) congratulates the Ford Motor Company for its \n     achievements; and\n       (3) expects that the Ford Motor Company will continue to \n     have an even greater impact in the 21st century and beyond by \n     providing innovative products that are affordable and \n     environmentally sustainable, and that will enhance personal \n     mobility for generations to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/21/senate-section/article/S6889-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6889-S6890]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 OMBUDSMAN REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK.
