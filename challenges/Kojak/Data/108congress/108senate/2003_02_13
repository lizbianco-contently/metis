The Senate will resume consideration of the nomination of \nMiguel Estrada to be a circuit judge for the DC Circuit. This is now \nthe sixth day of debate on this judicial nominee. I thank Chairman \nHatch, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, for leading the debate on \nMiguel Estrada last night. I believe Senator Hatch laid out very \nclearly the qualifications of this nominee, as well as the traditional \npractice and process of our judicial confirmations.\n  I thank all Members on this side of the aisle for their questions \nlast night. I believe those questions and answers provide a great \ninsight and clear away much of the rhetoric surrounding this well-\nqualified nominee.\n  Again last night I attempted to reach an agreement as to when we \nmight have an up-or-down vote on the Estrada nomination. All of my \nproposals were rejected. I hope out of a sense of fairness my \nDemocratic colleagues would rethink their objection and allow the time \ncertain for an up-or-down vote on Miguel Estrada.\n  With respect to the omnibus appropriations conference report, the \nHouse filed the report late, very late, last night. The House is \nexpected to act on that conference report later today. Therefore, it is \nmy intention the Senate will be able to complete action on that measure \non Friday.\n  I will be working with the Democratic leader in an effort to reach a \ntime agreement on that conference report. Rollcall votes are, \ntherefore, possible during today's and tomorrow's session.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The distinguished minority leader \nfrom South Dakota.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I ask the distinguished majority leader if it is his \nintention to bring the bill up tomorrow? There have been questions \nabout the schedule tomorrow. You did indicate it was more likely it \nwould come up tomorrow rather than tonight?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in response, it may well be tonight, in \nwhich case we could consider moving ahead tonight. It depends on when \nthe House finishes their business and delivers it to us. A number of \nSenators have asked. Looking realistically, it is likely to be \ntomorrow. But if we receive it\n\n[[Page S2372]]\n\nearlier, I will be more than happy to work on it tomorrow.\n  I might turn to the distinguished chairman and ask for his \nperspective on what we might see over the course of today.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, it is my understanding the House will not \nget to the bill until quite late tonight so I presume we will not \nreceive it until tomorrow.\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

ESTRADA, OF VIRGINIA, TO BE UNITED STATES \n           CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume executive session and the consideration of Executive \nCalendar No. 21, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Miguel A. Estrada, of \nVirginia, to be United States Circuit Judge for the District of \nColumbia Circuit.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The distinguished minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the presiding officer.\n  Let me say in response to the majority leader, it has been 8 days now \nsince Miguel Estrada's nomination came to the Senate floor. The issue \nin this case is not only Mr. Estrada's qualifications. An even more \nimmediate issue is Mr. Estrada's continued refusal to fill out what, \nfor all intents and purposes, is a job application. Mr. Estrada is \nasking for a lifetime appointment to the second most powerful court in \nthe land, the court just below the Supreme Court, and yet he refuses to \nanswer the simple questions that are asked routinely of men and women \nwho are nominated to the Federal bench.\n  We do not need more time to debate the nomination. We need more \nanswers. Without those answers, debate is hollow because we lack the \nbasic information we need to make an informed judgment about Mr. \nEstrada's fitness. We are prepared to wait as long as we have to for \nhis answers. Whether that wait lasts an hour, a day, a week, or even \nlonger, is up to the administration and Mr. Estrada.\n  The Constitution does not suggest, it does not hint that maybe it \nwould be a good idea for us to advise the President on his nominees and \nwithhold or offer our consent. The Constitution requires the Senate to \nadvise the President on the nominees and offer or withhold our consent. \nBy refusing to answer even the most basic questions, Mr. Estrada is not \nonly stonewalling the Senate, he is undermining the Constitution. He is \npreventing the Senate from exercising our fundamental constitutional \nresponsibility in this matter.\n  I will simply say to my colleagues: We will not relent on this \nmatter. We are united in our resolve to fulfill our obligation under \nthe Constitution.\n  There have been efforts made by some on the other side to confuse \npeople. They want the American people to believe that Democrats have \nbeen unfair in our handling of judicial nominations. I think most \npeople know better than that. In the last 17 months, we confirmed 100 \nFederal judges. All of those judges were nominated by President Bush \nand all of them, one can assume, are quite conservative judges.\n  Our Republican colleagues have even suggested that this debate may be \nabout Mr. Estrada's ethnicity. Some of his supporters have suggested--\nincredibly--that if you ask Mr. Estrada to answer questions, you are \nsomehow hostile to the rights of Hispanic Americans. They have asserted \non the floor of the Senate and also on the floor of the House that \nthose who ask questions are somehow anti-Hispanic.\n  That charge is desperate and, frankly, offensive, and it is obviously \nuntrue. In fact, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, which unanimously \nopposed Mr. Estrada's nomination, has actually demanded an apology from \nthose who have made this false claim. Regrettably, we have heard no \napology from those who have had the poor judgment to make such \nunfounded allegations. Even one of the groups that supports Mr. \nEstrada's nomination has denounced those allegations by Republicans. So \nI hope we are not going to hear any more of that ill-advised talk on \nthe Senate floor.\n  The fact is, many groups have expressed concern over Mr. Estrada's \nrefusal to answer the Senate's questions. Among them, few have spoken \nout more forcefully than the organizations representing Hispanic \nAmericans.\n  His nomination is opposed by every member of the Congressional \nHispanic Caucus, by the Mexican-American Legal Defense and Education \nFund, and the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund.\n  Leaders of the Mexican-American Legal Defense and Education Fund \nsaid:\n\n       It is unclear whether Mr. Estrada would be fair to Latino \n     plaintiffs as well as others who would appear before him with \n     claims under the First Amendment, the Fifth Amendment, and \n     Due Process clauses of the Constitution.\n\n  They continued:\n\n       Further, we found evidence that suggests that [Mr. Estrada] \n     may not serve as a fair and impartial jurist on allegations \n     brought before him in the areas of racial profiling, \n     immigration and abusive or improper police practices . . . .\n       We have concerns about whether he would fairly review \n     standing issues for organizations representing minority \n     interests, affirmative action programs or claims by low-\n     income consumers.\n       We are also unsure, after a careful review of his record, \n     whether he would fairly protect labor rights of immigrant \n     workers, or the rights of minority voters under the Voting \n     Rights Act.\n\n  All this, not from some Democratic Senator, not from some partisan \nDemocrat, but from one of the most respected Hispanic groups to speak \nout on this issue, on either side.\n  Other Hispanic groups, including the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and \nEducation Fund have expressed very similar concerns.\n  If these perceptions are inaccurate, Mr. Estrada could disprove \nthem--if he would stop stonewalling. But, unfortunately, so far he has \nrefused to do so.\n  As I said, there is far too much we don't know about Mr. Estrada. We \nwill do everything we can to prevent his nomination from coming to a \nvote until he provides this Senate and the American people with some \nstraight answers.\n  Perhaps the most troubling aspect of this situation is not the red \nherrings. It is not the cynical or false accusations of obstructionism \nor anti-Hispanic bigotry, as offensive as those charges are. What is \neven more troubling is what the Senate is not doing right now.\n  We have made it clear that the Senate cannot vote on the Estrada \nnomination until the necessary information is provided. Yet our \nRepublican colleagues have chosen to force this fight onto the floor \nrather than to take up other, more urgent business.\n  Americans who watched as this debate stretched late into the night \nlast night must have been mystified. They know we are facing daunting \nchallenges at this critical moment in our history. Our Nation may be on \nthe verge of war. We are told that America is at a high risk of \nterrorist attack. People are experiencing great anxiety about their \nsafety and the safety of their loved ones. What is more, millions of \nAmericans are out of work and our economy is in trouble.\n  Why--Americans must have asked themselves last night--with all of the \ngreat challenges confronting our nation, why has the Republican \nmajority chosen to pick this fight at this time?\n  I don't understand, and I doubt that people at home do, either.\n  America faces serious, even life-and-death challenges: homeland \nsecurity, the economy. That is what the Senate should be working on day \nand night. That is a good reason for an all-night session.\n  Miguel Estrada should stop the stonewalling. He should answer the \nSenate's questions and we should get on with addressing the real, \nurgent issues confronting our country--the economy, the terrorist \nattacks, and war in Iraq.\n  We can wait and we can talk, or we can set this nomination aside \nuntil we have the information to make an informed judgment and, in the \nmeantime, we can deal with the issues that\n\n[[Page S2373]]\n\nare of far greater consequence and far greater concern to the American \npeople. Until we deal with those concerns, we are not really meeting \nour responsibilities.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Daschle pertaining to the introduction of S. 385 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I had an opportunity to come to the \nfloor once before and express my views about the nominee who is before \nthe Senate for confirmation, Miguel Estrada. But I want to make a few \nadditional points at this time, and I hope I don't repeat myself.\n  I want to say for my part and for the part of many others in the body \nthat this is not a debate we were eager to begin; this is not a debate \nwe are eager to continue; but this is a debate that really goes to the \nheart of the separation of powers and the checks and balances that the \nFounders of this Nation so carefully crafted more than 200 years ago.\n  The President makes nominations to the Federal judiciary. This is \ntrue. But it is a judiciary that Congress fashioned, and it is a \njudiciary that the Senate has been given the constitutional \nresponsibility to help fill, through our advice and consent role.\n  I am one who has always believed that every nominee should get a full \nand fair hearing and that every nominee should then get an up-or-down \nvote. For too long, I watched one after another Clinton nominee \nlanguish without any such courtesy, and with no explanation as to why. \nMany of his nominees were minorities who never even got the chance to \nspeak to the Committee.\n  Chairman Hatch and I had many conversations during that time about \nmoving more nominees through the committee. And I know he did more than \nmany in his caucus would have liked him to do to move nominees. For \nthat, I thank him. I believe deep in his heart he also believes \nnominees should move through and get a hearing. But still, too many \nnominees were stopped from even the most basic of rights during the \nnomination process--a hearing--a basic right for someone who is \nnominated to the Judiciary Committee. They should have a right to have \na hearing, in my view.\n  In this case, the Democrat-controlled Senate gave Miguel Estrada a \nfull and fair hearing and every opportunity to show the committee what \nkind of judge he would be. But he did not use that opportunity well.\n  Although I believe that every nominee deserves an up-or-down vote, an \nup-or-down vote on final confirmation should only occur after the \nSenate has had a full opportunity to learn about the nominee and to \nproperly judge whether or not that nominee can serve impartially in the \nFederal judiciary. In this case, I don't believe we have enough \ninformation to make such a decision, as a direct result of the lack of \ncooperation by this nominee and by the White House. As a result, we \nshould not be asked to make such an important decision.\n  I want to clearly state this is not an issue of retaliation, as some \nhave suggested. It is true that the Republican Senate did block a \nnumber of very qualified Hispanic nominees--female nominees, and so \non--under President Clinton.\n  And it is true that many on this floor have mentioned those \nnominees--Enrique Moreno, for instance. But they were mentioned not to \nbegin some tit-for-tat exchange of blocked nominations. Quite the \ncontrary. Under Chairman Leahy, the Judiciary Committee and the \nDemocrat-controlled Senate confirmed 100 nominees in just over a year.\n  Mr. Estrada has already been given far better treatment than many \nwere given by the other side in the recent past. All we ask for is some \nbasic answers to the most basic of questions. Think about this: Before \nus now, we have a 41-year-old nominee about whom we know little. He has \nbeen nominated to a crucial appellate court, the DC Circuit, which is, \nat present, evenly split. That raises the question, Do we have a right \nto know if this judicial nominee can be impartial? I believe we do.\n  In this case, this nominee, for some reason, has been very \ncontroversial from the beginning. We have heard from many who have \nworked with Mr. Estrada or even supervised him, and many who have \nwatched him work throughout the years.\n  Without exception, all of these individuals believe Mr. Estrada is \nbright. And I am confident that every Democrat in this body agrees with \nthat assessment. But that is not the problem. And that is not the \nquestion today.\n  Without exception, all these individuals believe Mr. Estrada to be \nwell educated, as my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have \nindicated throughout the last few days. But that, too, is an issue that \nis not in doubt, and it is not the problem.\n  And essentially, without exception, all of these individuals believe \nMr. Estrada is conservative. Some believe him to be very conservative, \nsome less so, but all recognize him to be a conservative. Even Mr. \nEstrada himself, as I understand it, would likely describe himself in \nthis manner. But make no mistake, this is not about whether or not \nMiguel Estrada is conservative.\n  I have already voted for nominees whom I know to be conservative, as \nhave most, if not all, of my Democratic colleagues.\n  At the present time, I have just given my proxy to the Judiciary \nCommittee that is considering three nominees to appellate courts who \nare, in fact, conservative. And I will vote yes on those nominees.\n  So the question is not whether this nominee--or any nominee--is \nliberal or conservative, White or Hispanic, Jewish or Catholic, or any \nother group or inclination. The question with this nominee--and with \nevery nominee--is whether the nominee can put aside personal beliefs to \nrule fairly and impartially on the cases that come before him or her.\n  In some cases, we can get a clear idea of how a nominee would handle \nthe responsibilities of a Federal judgeship. But in this case, as we \ntried to get a clear idea of how this nominee would handle these \nresponsibilities, we were really stymied at every turn.\n  On the one hand, we have letters, phone calls. To my office, we have \nreceived almost 8,000 phone calls in opposition to this nominee; and \nless than 400 in favor. All these phone calls seem to indicate the \nbelief that Mr. Estrada is an ideologue who cannot be trusted with a \ncircuit court judgeship.\n  We have Professor Paul Bender, Mr. Estrada's direct supervisor at the \nDepartment of Justice, who said to the press that he believed Estrada \nto be so ``ideologically driven that he couldn't be trusted to state \nthe law in a fair, neutral way.'' Mr. Bender recently sent a letter to \nthe chairman of the Judiciary Committee essentially reaffirming this \nstatement.\n  We have major Hispanic organizations--just those groups one might \nexpect to most strongly support Mr. Estrada--strongly opposing him \ninstead.\n  On the other hand, as we look for facts to counteract such serious \nconcerns, we have almost nothing.\n  Miguel Estrada has never been a judge, so we have no record of \njudicial decisionmaking to examine. This in itself is not dispositive, \nbut it is the first area where we find no record to help us in our \ndecisions.\n  Mr. Estrada is not a prolific writer, so again, unlike many, we have \nno real record of writings or speeches to examine. Again, this alone \nwould not be dispositive, but, as I said earlier this week, in a sense, \nit is strike two in terms of where we can get information about this \nnominee.\n\n  We have not been granted access to the memos he wrote at the \nDepartment of Justice, so we can only take the word of the man who \nsupervised him that those memos were ideologically driven and could not \nbe trusted. That is strike three.\n  Mr. Estrada refused to adequately participate in his own confirmation \nhearing, so we have no real answers to these questions. And the \nquestions are legitimate.\n  Even when given time to think about his answers, even when he was \ngiven questions in written form, he refused to answer those questions, \nusing precisely the same language he used to refuse to answer at his \nhearing.\n  For instance, when Senator Durbin asked this nominee, in writing: \n``Do you have an opinion on the merits of Roe v. Wade?'' Mr. Estrada \nresponded, as he did to me in committee, ``it\n\n[[Page S2374]]\n\nwould not be appropriate for me to express such a view without doing \nthe intensive work that a judge hearing the case would have to \nundertake--not only reading briefs and hearing the arguments of \ncounsel, but also independently investigating the relevant \nconstitutional text, case law, and history.''\n  In the hearing, I asked him: Do you believe Roe was correctly \ndecided? And he said he could not answer that question.\n  When Senator Kennedy asked Mr. Estrada, in writing, how he would have \nresolved a case that came before the DC Circuit and was then decided by \nthe Supreme Court--Hoffman Plastics--Mr. Estrada again answered that \nbecause he had not read the briefs and was not present at oral \nargument, he could not answer.\n  When Senator Kennedy asked him about the Maryland/DC/Delaware \nBroadcasters case, again Mr. Estrada said he could not, or would not, \nanswer.\n  When Senator Durbin asked Mr. Estrada to name any judge, living or \ndead, whom he would seek to emulate, Mr. Estrada said he could name not \none judge he would emulate.\n  In contrast, let me take a moment to talk about Judge Richard Paez, a \nwell-qualified Hispanic nominee sent to the Senate by President Clinton \nand eventually confirmed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  Judge Paez spent more than 1,500 days before this Senate before he \nfinally got a vote. And this came despite the fact that he answered \nevery question put to him.\n  For instance, Senator Sessions asked him: ``Which Supreme Court \nJustice or federal judge has most influenced your judicial \nphilosophy?'' Judge Paez named Judge Harry Hupp, a man he appeared \nbefore as a litigator, and a colleague of his on the district court \nbench.\n  Senator Sessions asked Richard Paez: ``In your opinion what is the \ngreatest Supreme Court decision in American history?'' Judge Paez did \nnot refuse to answer, or claim that he could not give an answer because \nhe had not been present at oral arguments. Instead, he simply named \nBrown v. Board of Education.\n  Senator Sessions then asked: ``What is the worst Supreme Court \ndecision?'' Judge Paez answered: ``Dred Scott.'' This is the decision \nwhere the Supreme Court ruled, essentially, ``once a slave, always a \nslave.''\n  Miguel Estrada, on the other hand, would not answer these types of \nquestions.\n  Senator Schumer asked him to name any Supreme Court case he thought \nwas wrongly decided.\n  He did not simply say he thinks Plessy v. Ferguson was wrongly \ndecided. That is the case that upheld the concept of separate but \nequal. And even the Supreme Court has since overturned it. I know of \nfew people who would claim Plessy was correctly decided. But Miguel \nEstrada apparently thinks he could not say so without having heard the \noral arguments. He did not say he disagreed with the Dred Scott \ndecision, which upheld slavery. He did not say he believed Korematsu, \nwhich upheld the right of the United States to put American citizens of \nJapanese descent into internment camps. He named none of these cases. \nHe simply said he could not answer the question.\n  This is in direct contrast to a recent experience with Jeffrey Sutton \nduring his hearing less than 2 weeks ago. Mr. Sutton is also a \ncontroversial nominee, but he answered every question put to him. We \ngot a good sense of how he would think and act as a judge. I, myself, \nwho was concerned about him initially, felt he was a strong advocate, \nbut he knew the difference. He could separate himself from the \npositions of advocacy and become a fair and impartial judge. So I have \ngiven my proxy right now to be carried out to vote yes for Judge \nSutton. Mr. Estrada, on the other hand, did his best to keep from \nputting himself on record on any issue of real substance.\n  Quite frankly, there are options. One, return this nominee to the \nJudiciary Committee for answers. The Senate deserves the answers. \nDemocratic nominees were asked by distinguished Republican Senators to \nanswer questions such as this, and they did. Even of those, many had \njudicial records. Many had prolific writings. Many had speeches so that \nthere were tools we could go to to understand what their thinking was. \nBut in this case we have no speeches. We have no writings. We have no \nrecord. Therefore, the answers to the questions become extraordinarily \ndispositive. They also become meaningful to any Senator who wants to \ncast an informed vote.\n  It is that simple. That is what this debate is about. We cannot \npossibly fulfill our constitutional duty to advise and consent to \nnominees if we are not given the necessary information about the \nnominee.\n  In a case where you have a critical circuit such as the DC Circuit, \nnot only the plumbing grounds for the U.S. Supreme Court, but handling \nenvironmental appeals, Superfund appeals, wetlands appeals, OSHA \nappeals, all kinds of administrative case law appeals, how this court \nis tilted becomes important to us, particularly if we take this job of \nconfirmation of nominees seriously.\n  There is another option. That option is appoint Miguel Estrada to a \ndistrict court. Give him an opportunity to gain that record. He is 41 \nyears old. He is younger than my daughter. Give him an opportunity to \ngain that record. Remember, this is a man who will serve for 30, 40, \npossibly even 50 years. It is a lifetime appointment. We are entitled \nto answers to these questions.\n  In Miguel Estrada's questionnaire, he admitted to having written no \nbooks, articles, or reports of any kind, save one Law Review article in \nlaw school. That was titled ``The Policies Behind Lending Limits.'' He \nwrote that in 1985. At Miguel Estrada's hearing, he would not comment \non whether any case had ever been wrongly decided, even cases that have \nbeen overturned. He would not name any single judge he would want to \nemulate on the bench in any way. He would not answer written questions \nput to him that would help us learn more about how he thinks about \ncases and how he would judge them. He would not even try to convince \nthe Justice Department to turn over some of the memos he wrote for the \nSolicitor General's Office, nor would he himself turn them over.\n  If this nominee is confirmed, we believe we would be sending a signal \nthat stonewalling the Judiciary Committee and the full Senate is the \nway to succeed on the way to a judgeship. That is the wrong signal and \nthe wrong message.\n  In effect, we would be abdicating our constitutional role, our \nconstitutional duty to advise and consent to nominees, because we would \nnever again be able to learn enough about a nominee to make reasoned \ndecisions.\n  Nominees could become increasingly young, increasingly ideological, \nand increasingly silent. The courts would soon be packed with judges of \nunknown disposition, unknown temperament, and unknown proclivities to \njudge fairly and impartially.\n  We should take our constitutional duties more seriously than that. We \nsimply are determined not to let that happen.\n  I would like to read the concluding sentence from the editorial in \ntoday's New York Times:\n\n       The White House can call this politics or obstruction. But \n     in fact it is Senators doing their jobs.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my colleague from California. She laid out the \nfacts beautifully. I will attempt to try and talk about this issue from \nmy perspective as someone who worked so hard on getting a couple of \nnominees through the Senate. Senator Feinstein touched on those \nparticular cases. They are relevant to what we are doing here.\n  I remind colleagues--I know they are aware of this, but it is worth \nrepeating--we are talking about a lifetime appointment to one of the \nmost important courts in the Nation, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia. It is a lifetime appointment. It is very \nimportant when we are looking at these types of appointments.\n  I have voted for well over 90 percent of the President's appointees \nup to this time. It is very unusual for me to stand up here and say: We \nneed more information. It is important to go back to the Constitution \nand read exactly what it tells us we have to do. Section 2:\n\n       [The President] shall have the Power, by and with the \n     Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties, provided \n     two-thirds of\n\n[[Page S2375]]\n\n     the Senators present concur; and he shall nominate, and by \n     and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint \n     Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of \n     the supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United \n     States, whose Appointments are not herein otherwise provided \n     for . . .\n\n  There has been a lot of discussion that we are in essence interfering \nwith the rights of the President. It is very clear: If we sit back and \ndon't do the work of advice and consent, we don't deserve to be in the \nSenate. This is where the rubber meets the road. This is where we have \nto play a role. Advice and consent just means that.\n  I want to relate a story, when Senator Hatch, who is now \ndistinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee, was chairman before \nSenator Leahy and President Clinton was President at that time. Senator \nHatch had a very direct conversation with me, and I am sure he did with \nother Democrats. What I like about Senator Hatch is, you kind of know \nwhere he is coming from.\n  He said: Senator Boxer, you have to send me moderates. Don't send me \nany liberals. Don't send me any progressives. Don't send me any \nactivists. I want moderates for the bench. I am telling you here now, \nif they are not, they are not going anywhere. I had a little \nconversation with him about that but realized this was the pragmatics \nof politics and this is what we are going to do.\n\n  In essence, the nominees I had recommended to the President and \nPresident Clinton were mainstream moderate candidates. Even with that, \na lot of them had a hard time here. But they made it, and I want to \ntalk about how long it took and how many questions they had to answer \nand what we went through to make it happen.\n  I feel sometimes like Alice in Wonderland when I hear the kind of \ndouble standard that seems to be coming forward. This man, Mr. Estrada, \ncannot answer any questions, but look at how many questions they asked \nMargaret Morrow. Margaret Morrow--we recommended her to President \nClinton. She was a distinguished lawyer in a business law firm. She is \nas straightforward as motherhood and apple pie. They asked her question \non question on question. These are Republicans on the Judiciary \nCommittee. She waited maybe 2 years before she could be voted on. Here \nis the interesting thing. Not only did the Republicans ask her every \nquestion known to humankind about everything she had ever written, they \nhad to see everything she ever wrote, and everything else. They then \nwent back and asked her how she voted in elections in California \ndealing with referendum. It was amazing. The first question was, How \ndid you vote on every memorandum, I think it was, in the last 10 years. \nShe was so stunned with it, she said: Barbara, this is between me and \nthe secrecy of the ballot box. I said: If you want to move forward, you \nare going to have to respond.\n  We went to Senator Grassley, who wanted answers to these questions, \nand he limited it to the 10 most controversial referendums. I am \ntalking about the ones that deal with every single hot button issue. \nShe answered the questions. Believe me, it is really a personal issue, \nhow you vote when you get to the ballot box.\n  Now there is a big fuss about our getting answers to questions such \nas: Will you give us one Supreme Court case you didn't agree with or \nsend us your writings, for which there is adequate precedent.\n  So under the Constitution, the President and the Senate share the \npower to appoint the principal officers of the United States. I read \nthe Constitution and, if we were to do otherwise, it really would be a \ndereliction of our duty if we rolled over and said whatever any \nPresident wants, just go ahead and roll over the Senate. Not me; I \ndon't care if I have to stand here all night--and I might have to at \nthe rate this is going.\n  I am here because I have to represent the 35 million people of \nCalifornia. When someone comes up to me in the grocery store and says, \nI noticed they had a vote on Miguel Estrada to the second most \nimportant court in the land, what does he think? I would say that I \nhave no idea.\n  I have to tell you, there are a lot of groups against Miguel Estrada \nand they have their reasons. I will list the groups--a lot of Hispanic \ngroups and a lot of other civil rights groups. They have their reasons.\n  I need to see what he stands for. If I get these papers--that is the \nreason we are not permitting a vote because if we would get these \npapers, we would permit a vote here. He may well win that vote or he \nmay lose that vote. That is the fair thing. But advise and consent--\nbefore you can consent, you have to see who this man is. Maybe when I \nsee his writings--and I hope we get answers to our questions--I \ncertainly would have no interest in holding this up at all.\n\n  Blind judgment is not the proper way to confirm someone to the \nFederal court. As I said, if I were to engage in blind judgment, I \nwould not be true to my constitutional responsibilities and what I owe \nthe people of my State. Frankly, I told them I would vote for \nmainstream people, just as President Bush said he would nominate \nmainstream people. That is what he promised us. The night the Supreme \nCourt decided the election, he said eloquently, ``I am going to govern \nfrom the center.''\n  Maybe Miguel Estrada is from the center. Nobody here can tell you \nbecause he cannot even name one Supreme Court case he disagreed with--\neven the one on making slavery legal. So these are very serious \nmatters, very serious matters.\n  Stealth maneuvers are appropriate for the military but not for \njudicial nominees. By evading questions about his record, Mr. Estrada \nis trying to slip into a lifetime position on the Federal bench without \nsharing information about his record. So if we were to just say, OK, we \ndon't know anything, the man cannot name a case he disagrees with and \nwon't show us any writings, and we just have the vote, what will happen \nwhen we get a Supreme Court nominee for a vote?\n  We have reason to believe there are some who are advising these \nnominees not to say anything about anything. I will talk about that \nlater. It was really at a Federalist Society luncheon last year that a \npanelist coached potential nominees on how to get confirmed by the \nSenate. This has been written about in the legal times.\n  The simple instructions that came were--I am quoting because this \nisn't very nice language, but it is the language that was used--``Keep \nyour mouth shut.''\n  What a situation. It is an honor to be nominated by the President, a \nchance to tell people what you believe in--not to talk about a case \nbefore the court or one that is coming. That is not what we are saying.\n  I represent the largest percentage of Hispanics in the United States. \nThere are close to 11 million Californians who are Latinos. That is \napproximately 33 percent of my State. I resent roundly some of the \ncomments by my colleagues on the other side that somehow those of us \nwho are saying to Miguel Estrada: answer the question, be a grown up, \nthis is a serious job, that are against minorities. If it wasn't such a \nserious charge, it would be, in a way, laughable.\n  I could tell you that the organizations that oppose Mr. Estrada, or \nhave raised concerns, most of them are Latino. They know, in the case \nof the Democrats in my State, who fights for the Latinos. That isn't \neven a question. I fought hard to get a Mexican-American nominee, \nRichard Paez, a position on the Central District Court of California. \nMr. President, he became the first Mexican American to sit on that \ncourt, and it was a struggle. It was a struggle. President Clinton \nnominated him. Judge Paez was so stellar in the district court that he \nwas nominated by President Clinton to the circuit court. He had to wait \n4--count them--not months, not weeks, but 4 years before the Senate \nacted on his nomination.\n  Judge Paez was voted out of committee three times, Mr. President, \nthree times, and still he had to endure 4 years of waiting before the \nSenate acted on his nomination.\n  He was nominated in three different Congresses before his \nconfirmation in March 2000. He was the first Hispanic to sit on the \ndistrict court. He had extensive experience as a judge on State courts, \nas well as Federal courts, with lawyer reviews in the Almanac of the \nFederal Judiciary such as ``well prepared,'' ``runs a good courtroom,'' \n``excellent judicial temperament,'' ``fair,'' ``evenhanded,'' and \n``gets to the right result.''\n\n[[Page S2376]]\n\n  Who held him up for 4 years? Not the Democrats. The Republicans.\n  He answered every question. Every single bit of his writing was \nanalyzed. There were more written questions asked and answered. He was \nstrongly supported by Hispanic groups, such as the Mexican American \nLegal Defense Fund, in contrast to Mr. Estrada, who has a huge number \nof Hispanic groups with great concern about his nomination.\n  I have to tell you when I hear some of the comments from the other \nside--it is really amazing--I can only think that this is all about \npolitics because reality is not even in the game. This Republican \nSenate fought so hard against Judge Paez. Four years they made him wait \nand made him answer question after question--written and oral--and \nwould not stop there.\n  When his nomination finally came to the floor, there was a \nfilibuster, and it was finally broken.\n  I have to say as someone who fought for that first Latino to sit on \nthe court in California and for one who fought to get the first Asian \nAmerican judge on the Eastern District of California, Anthony Ishii, \nanother wonderful appointment by President Clinton. It is extraordinary \nto me to hear some of the rhetoric from the other side. I have some \nnews for the other side: Tell the man to answer the questions just as \nthey asked Richard Paez, just as they asked Margaret Morrow, just as \nthey asked every single nominee by President Clinton. They asked them \nto answer the questions. They called them back. They sent them long \nquestionnaires in the mail. How about saying the man the Republicans \nsupport has to do the same? It is pretty simple. Then we will not be \nhere wasting this precious time we should be using to discuss homeland \nsecurity and other issues.\n  I will tell my colleagues right now, I will stand here as long as it \ntakes until I get answers to those questions because otherwise, I do \nnot deserve to be here. My people in California should boot me out if I \nroll over and play dead simply because the President says: I want this \nman; he does not want to answer the questions; and the Federalist \nSociety tells him to keep his mouth shut. This is not what we do in an \nopen society. In an open society, there is no room for secrecy in the \njudge selection process.\n  This is the greatest country in the world. If somebody is nominated \nfor this position, they should be proud to talk about what are the \nSupreme Court cases they may not agree with or some they do. They \nshould be proud to say: Yes, I will make sure you get my writings \nbecause I am proud of my writings.\n  The American people do not like secrecy. They do not like it. I hope \nthey are, in fact, listening to this debate because I want to state \nagain what we Democrats are doing. It is not a handful. The President \nsaid a handful of people--I forget his exact words. I think it was a \nhandful of people were stopping this nomination. The fact is, there are \na lot of us from different parts of the country and different \nphilosophies who are saying: Just give us the information. Some of us \nmay wind up voting for Mr. Estrada; some of us may not. Give us the \ninformation. We need it. We deserve it. It is in the Constitution.\n\n  The Constitution does not say the President shall have everyone he \nwants. Read it. It gives equal power--equal power--to the Senate. I say \nto my colleagues on the other side, where is their self-respect for the \nSenate? That is what it is about. It is unfortunate it turned out to be \na partisan split.\n  I keep remembering back to Margaret Morrow and how many questions the \nRepublicans asked her. Oh, my God. There were two hearings: One in 1996 \nand one in 1997. There was round after round of followup questions, \nincluding how she voted in every California ballot measure for 10 long \nyears. I ask you, Mr. President--maybe you would remember. If you lived \nin California, I assure you, there would be, oh God, hundreds of \nreferenda. Finally, Senator Grassley, who was asking her this, said: \nOK, just tell us how you voted on the 10 most controversial ballot \nmeasures.\n  I want to read a partial list of people who are supporting us in this \ndelay: The Congressional Hispanic Caucus; the Congressional Black \nCaucus--these are elected leaders who have fought hard to get \nminorities on the bench. This is extraordinary for them to have to \nstand up and say: We want more minorities on the bench, but we want to \nknow who they are; we do not know who this guy is.\n  Hispanic organizations: Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education \nFund; Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund; National \nAssociation of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials, National Council \nof La Raza, National Puerto Rican Coalition, California La Raza \nLawyers, Puerto Rican Bar Association of Illinois, Southwest Voter \nRegistration Education Project, Labor Council for Latin American \nAdvancement, 52 Latino labor leaders.\n  Mr. President, these are people who fight hard to put minorities on \nthe bench, and they are very concerned. Do you think this is easy for \nthem? This is not easy for them. It is brave of them. They are doing it \nbecause they are very concerned.\n  There is a list of 52 leaders. I will not read the list. We also have \nthe Leadership Conference on Civil Rights and the Alliance for Justice. \nWe have the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund, Lawyers \nfor Civil Rights Under Law, Alliance for Justice, and it goes on.\n  I also want to read an article that was in the Legal Times. We put it \nin the Record, but I think it is worth listening to it:\n\n       President George W. Bush's judicial nominees received some \n     very specific confirmation advice last week: Keep your mouth \n     shut.\n       The warning came from someone who had been a part of the \n     process, Laurence Silberman, a senior judge at the U.S. Court \n     of Appeals. . . .\n\n  And it goes on. He advises: Don't answer any questions. Don't answer \nthem and, he basically said, you will land a judgeship.\n  This is dangerous. Talk about the role of the Senate. The Senate \ncannot do its work on advice and consent if we are stonewalled.\n  My view on this nomination is clear. I am happy to vote up or down on \nthis nominee any day of the week, but he has to answer the questions. \nPeriod. End of quote.\n  Someone who is afraid to answer questions either does not know the \nanswer, has something he does not want to say, or is hiding something. \nIt makes no sense at all. Answer the questions. If Senator Hatch brings \nthe committee back and Mr. Estrada gets a chance to answer these \nquestions that Senator Feinstein and others have laid out--believe me, \nI have no interest in knowing how he voted for the last 10 years like \nthe Republicans asked one of my nominees. I think that is going way too \nfar. I do not care about that. I thought it was outrageous when the \nRepublicans asked that of Margaret Morrow. I could not believe it. She \nwas stunned, but she answered it. Even though it is a secret ballot, \nshe answered it because she respected the Senators who asked her the \nquestions. She respected the process. She respected the Constitutional \nrequirement of advice and consent.\n  So we go from a woman who was asked by the Republicans to tell how \nshe voted on a series of referenda in her home State on the most \ncontroversial issues to a candidate where the Republicans say it is \nfine, forget about it, we are not going to give any answers. It is a \nremarkable thing. I make that point today. We need to hear from this \nnominee. We owe it to the American people.\n  What do my colleagues think this is? This is not some dictatorship. \nThis is not some situation where one man, the President, nominates \nsomeone and says, OK, that is it, I can tell the Senate who I want and \nthat is the end of it. If the Founders wanted that, they would not have \nwritten this article, which is very clear. As was pointed out by \nSenator Schumer, if we go back to the Federalist Papers, there was a \nbig debate over who should have the power. At one point, it was going \nto be the Senate that had the full power, but then in the end it was a \ncompromise. So if we assume that what is written in this Constitution \nis what we swore to uphold, then to do any less is to essentially throw \nthis away.\n\n  I do not care what people say, I am not going to do that. They can \nsay anything they want about me, it is OK. I will take the case to my \npeople. I will tell my people it would be far easier to\n\n[[Page S2377]]\n\nroll over, but I am not going to do it. If Mr. Estrada answers the \nquestion, I will not be standing here. I will be calling for a vote and \nlet the chips fall where they may.\n  I do not know how my Republicans friends will vote on Mr. Estrada. I \nam assuming they will support him, and he will be a judge. Or maybe \nthey will find out something in his record that is worrisome that they \ndo not like. I do not know what is in the record because he will not \nshow us the record.\n  As long as this Constitution is the basis of our Government, we \nshould respect it. What happens when the next judge comes before us? \nThe President may say this is a good deal, my guy did not have to \nanswer anything and he will go on to do whatever he wants, and then he \nsends someone else who has no record and will not show writings and \nwill not answer questions and listens to the Federalist Society where \nthey say keep your mouth shut, which is exactly what they said. Where \nare we headed?\n  This is not a partisan question. I would feel the same way if \nPresident Clinton were still President and sent down a nominee who \nwould not answer questions. I went out of my way on Margaret Morrow and \non Richard Paez. One was held up for 22 months. One was voted out of \nthree Congresses, waited 4 years. There were oral questions, written \nquestions, more questions. The session ends, and there is a \nrenomination. Again, there are questions; appearances again, writings \nagain. If we go down this road of not asking questions and not \ndemanding answers to basic questions such as was there ever a Supreme \nCourt case you did not agree with, and a man or woman says, you know \nwhat, I cannot answer that question, that is a frightening answer. \nMaybe he agreed with all of them. I do not know, because he will not \nanswer the question.\n  Mr. President, I believe I have the floor until 12:30, although I \ntechnically have it as long as I wish.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). There is no unanimous consent. \nThe Senator has the floor as long as she is able to stand.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair. I see one of my colleagues. I do not \nintend to go on much longer than about 15 minutes, but I want to talk \nabout a couple of other issues.\n\n\n                    The Challenges Facing Our Nation\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we are making the case about advise and \nconsent but many of our people around the country are worried about \nwhat is coming in these next couple of days. The country is on alert. \nPeople are asking me, should I really go out and get duct tape? What \ncan I do?\n  I have been around politics for a very long time. I was elected to \nthe House in 1982. These are the toughest times I have seen, and I have \nseen some tough ones. We have an economy that is not performing. We \nhave a budget which has turned from surplus to deficit.\n  The very people who said deficits were terrible when Democrats were \nin the majority are saying deficits are now fine as long as they are \nnot more than so many percent of the gross national product, no \nproblem. Unfortunately for those people, Alan Greenspan said deficits \ndo matter, and we have an economy that is the worst that it has been in \n50 years. On top of that, we have Osama bin Laden who apparently issued \na warning to Americans and he told the Iraqi people that if the \nAmericans come in there, do what it takes to hurt them all around the \nworld.\n  We have the tragedy and sadness of the Shuttle Columbia. We have the \nnews that North Korea possesses perhaps the ability to hit the west \ncoast, where I live and my people I represent live and not far from \nwhere the Presiding Officer lives. We have a lot of challenges.\n  What I say today is measured in my comments because whatever the \nfuture holds for us, and I think many people fear it is war, we are \ngoing to pull together as one. Looking at all of these challenges I \nmentioned, and I exclude from that the shuttle tragedy, but the North \nKorea situation, the Iraq situation, the Osama bin Laden situation, the \neconomic situation, I believe this administration has seen these crises \nand they have amplified them. I do not think they are solving them. I \nthink they are amplifying them. I do not see the path to a prosperous \neconomy in any of the plans. I see more deficits as far as the eye can \nsee. I do not see a path for job creation. I do not see a path where we \nare protected in our homeland. I see my local responders saying, Where \nis the help that was promised?\n  I do not see that. I do not see a path to peace in Iraq. I see a lot \nof energy and focus on a path to war. I do not see the path--and I have \nlived through many administrations, Republican and Democratic. I wish \nthe President would put the same focus and attention on avoiding war \nand disarming Iraq as he does on war to disarm Iraq. War may be \ninevitable. It should not be a first resort or a second. It should be a \nvery last.\n  Looking at North Korea, why are we not talking to them? We have \nbrilliant people in the State Department.\n  As far as I can tell from my post on the Foreign Relations Committee, \nwe have not elevated this to the same level as Iraq in any way, shape, \nor form. They keep saying we will resolve this diplomatically. I am \nglad. But I don't see that focus. What I see is when the North Koreans \nwant to talk, they fly to New Mexico to talk to Bill Richardson. \nSomething is wrong with that. We need to do better.\n  I see issues turning into problems, turning into crises, and I don't \nsee them being resolved; I see them getting worse. I can tell you, when \nI go home, people are coming up to me in the supermarket--Democrats, \nRepublicans, Independents--tugging at my sleeve, literally. They say: \nWe are anxious. We are worried. We are scared.\n  I am waiting for the type of leadership in this administration on all \nof these issues that will help us see the light at the end of the \ntunnel. We will pull together as Americans, regardless. The greatest \nNation in the world, we will meet our challenges. But there is much \nmore we need to do--not more deficits as far as the eye can see. That \nis not going to help. Not talk about war, war, war, and ignoring the \nchance that we can avoid it and achieve the total disarmament of Iraq. \nI don't see the kind of help to our hometowns, if you will, to get \nready.\n  Someone said it right--this is not original on my part; I believe it \nwas a mayor of one of our Midwest cities. She said when people fear an \nattack by a terrorist, they are going to call 9-1-1. They are not going \nto call the Senate, and they are not calling the President. They will \ncall 9-1-1.\n  What are we doing? We lauded the firemen and the policemen, as well \nwe should have. The best way to honor them is to give them the help \nthey need. Guess what this administration is doing. It is canceling the \nCOPS program. These are the grants to our local law enforcement people \nwho are going to get the 9-1-1 call if, God forbid, there is an attack \non our homeland.\n  This President is spending a lot of money in the budget. But talk to \nthe people back home, and they are not happy with the unfunded mandates \nthey are seeing. We see an unprecedented attack on the environment. \nTalk about danger, I will tell you about danger. As we worry about \nchemical and biological attacks, Osama bin Laden, why have we lost the \nfocus on getting him? The President was fierce in his resolve to get \nOsama bin Laden, and we have not achieved that up until this point. We \nfear the chemical and biological attack.\n  Seventy million Americans--and that includes 10 million children--\nlive within 4 miles of a Superfund site which contains these dreadful \nchemicals that harm our children and all of us. What have they done? \nThey have slowed the cleanups and are now telling taxpayers they have \nto pick up all of the costs of that program because they do not want to \ncontinue a fee on the polluters, which was something put into place \nunder Republican and Democratic administrations. This is a crisis, and \nit is being amplified by this administration.\n  I look around and I see the fund sites proliferating. Under President \nClinton, we cleaned up an average of 87 sites a year. It is down to 40 \nsites. It is down to the taxpayers now picking up the tab, and people \nare beginning to be very fearful about their children's health.\n  There are many issues that confront us. I will close with this. Last \nnight, the Republicans stayed in the Chamber to make their point. That \nwas a good thing to do. I am in the Chamber today\n\n[[Page S2378]]\n\nto make my point. Give me the information, folks. Tell this man to \nanswer the same number of questions you asked Richard Paez. Tell this \nman to answer the same number of questions you asked Margaret Morrow to \nanswer. Tell this man to answer the same number of questions and in the \nsame depth as President Clinton's nominees answered. And if you do not \nlike that approach, simply ask him to answer the questions that some of \nPresident Bush's nominees answered.\n\n  We are not going to stand here and treat this Constitution as some \nrelic. We have equal power with the President. If we were not to ask \nfor these answers, we do not deserve to be here.\n  I see a couple of my friends on the floor, and I have to say, I am \nready to vote on Miguel Estrada as soon as he answers the questions. I \nam not going to roll over for any President, Republican or Democrat, if \nthey send us people who are either too scared to answer the questions \nor we are told by some Federalist Society expert to keep your mouth \nshut and it will go well. It is wrong.\n  I have some self-respect as a Senator. Do you know who gave it to me? \nI was not born with it. The people who sent me here--35 million \nstrong--believe me, they did not all send me here, but of those who \nvoted, a majority did. Do you know what I told them? I told them that \nthe makeup of the courts is very important and the power of the courts \nis very important. I promised them that before I cast a vote, aye or \nnay on anyone, I would have information and I would always tell you why \nI was voting yes or no. And I have voted for more than 90 percent of \nthis President's nominees. I don't know how I will vote on this one. I \nmight vote for him if I see his writings. I might. I might not. I may \nfind that he does not come from the center, which is what President \nBush promised. We would get judges from the center.\n  They can stay here all night and talk and talk and talk and talk. But \nI will be ready to vote when I have seen the answers to the questions, \nthe same kind of questions they asked Margaret Morrow, Richard Paez, \nand every one of Bill Clinton's nominees.\n  Double standards do not sell with me. I worked very well with Senator \nHatch and colleagues on the Judiciary Committee on both sides of the \naisle when I had people I was very interested in getting through the \nprocess. And I said to them: You deserve to know every single thing you \nare asking for, and I will work with these nominees and make sure they \ngive you those answers.\n  That is respect. That is respect for the job we are supposed to do. I \nrespect this job. I respect the people I represent too much to roll \nover and say to this President or any other: Send nominees down who \nwill not answer questions. It does not matter to me. It is your choice.\n  If I were to do that, I would be belying this Constitution. When I \ngot elected to this body, I held up my hand and I swore to protect and \ndefend it. It means everything to me. It is more important than me. It \nis more important than any other Senator. It is more important than any \nPresident. This is the document that has kept us going as the greatest \ndemocracy in the world all these years. And God forbid we turn our back \non it. If we do, we will not recognize the country we will have.\n  I see coming, if we roll over on this one, a judge selection process \nthat is essentially a secret process. That is something I cannot \nsupport, I will never support, even if I am the only one left who feels \nthat way--and I doubt that will be the case because there are very \nstrong feelings on my side of the aisle that the judicial selection \nprocess should be an open process, an honest process, a fair process.\n  I appreciate the chance to express my views on these issues and other \nissues. It is time we solve the problems we are facing and not create \nnew ones. A new problem we are creating is judicial nominees who will \nnot talk. That is a new problem. I hope, as a result of what we are \ndoing today, the Republicans will go back, they will chat with Mr. \nEstrada, they will tell him to answer the questions, and we can get on \nwith a vote and the other important business we have before us.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, the Honorable Senator from California \nlaid out a very touching and moving litany of the times in which we \nlive. These are difficult times, with the prospect of dealing with a \nbrutal dictator in Iraq, a dictator who has used weapons of mass \ndestruction against his own people, has shown no hesitation to use \npoison gas, chemicals, and biological weapons, a dictator who clearly \nhas ignored resolution after resolution of the United Nations over a \n12-year period, who poses a threat to all of us. That crisis looms out \nthere. The day of decision is coming soon. As the President has noted, \nSaddam Hussein will either disarm or be disarmed. We have to be \nconcerned about what is happening in North Korea where they are talking \nabout restarting a nuclear program that they agreed to abort.\n  We have problems of recession. A lot of folks in my State are worried \nabout where the next paycheck is going to come from, worried about the \nstate of the economy. We have a lot of concerns out there. This is a \ntime of great uncertainty. This magnificent, august body, the Senate, \none of the greatest deliberative bodies in the world, instead of \nfocusing its efforts on dealing with those issues of great concern, we \nare involved and engaged in trying to break off a filibuster from my \nhonorable colleagues on the other side who are not going to allow us to \nhave a vote, a simple up-or-down vote--that is all we are asking for--\non the nomination of Miguel Estrada to the circuit court of appeals.\n  I have been here a little over a month. I don't have that great sense \nof history that my colleagues, such as Mr. Byrd, the Honorable Senator \nfrom West Virginia, has. He is a walking history of the Senate. I sit \nhere in awe as I listen to him.\n  I listen to the honorable chair of the Judiciary Committee, Senator \nHatch, who has been here a long time. I still get chills standing where \nI am standing, looking at this great sense of history. Yet we are \nsitting here, and I was listening last night, and we are talking about \nthe nomination of the first Hispanic to serve on the circuit court, and \nwhat I am listening to is a litany of who did what to whom before. You \nwould almost think that we were the Hatfields and McCoys instead of \nDemocrats and Republicans. You would think we were the Earps and \nYoungers at the OK Corral.\n  I don't know who did what in the past. I don't know why a particular \njudge in the past perhaps took a long period of time before they got a \nchance to have a vote on the floor of the Senate. I don't know who was \nright yesterday and who was wrong. But this is today. This is a time \nwhen I got elected. I can tell you the citizens of Minnesota were \nsaying they wanted to get past the bitter partisanship that stops the \nSenate from doing its business. They want public figures to simply get \nsomething done, move on, take care of the flood problem, the disaster \nproblems we have had in northwest Minnesota, the drought that is \naffecting other parts of the country, get an energy bill through, get a \nbudget--that would not be a bad thing for the U.S. Government--get a \nbudget passed. Moms and dads have to deal with that all the time. We \nhave folks out there clamoring for us to just do what we have been \nelected to do, to do our business.\n\n  Instead, I listened last night to the Honorable Senator from New York \nand the Honorable Senator from Illinois, and they had pictures of \ncandidates in the past who, for some reason or other, did not get \nthrough the Judiciary Committee fast enough. We went back and forth and \nback and forth and back and forth. You know, that was yesterday.\n  We are never going to be younger than we are today. The proverbial: \nToday is the first day of the rest of your life. What would be so hard \nfor us, as a deliberative body, to say we are going to start with \ntoday, we are going to make sure--we are going to put aside all the \nsins of yesterday and make sure that, from here on, when folks come up, \nthey have a hearing and they have a vote?\n  By the way, I have to say I have heard my honorable colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle talk about Mr. Estrada not answering questions. \nThis has been shown last night; Senator Hatch showed it many times. \nThis is the transcript of the hearing, the all-day hearing in which he \nanswered question after question after question.\n\n[[Page S2379]]\n\nMaybe he gave answers folks on the other side of the aisle did not \nlike, but he answered questions. He answered questions. Then, after the \nhearing itself, a few Senators--I understand two Senators on the other \nside of the aisle--sent written questions, which he answered. So he has \nanswered the questions.\n  What we have today, unfortunately, is we are getting caught up in the \nworst kind of partisan wrangling based on what folks did yesterday.\n  I think we are better than that. I think this august, deliberative \nbody is better than that. I think it would be good for America today, \nin this new millennium, this new century, to forget what happened in \nthe last millennium. Let's move forward on this one and say what we are \ngoing to do and say a nominee of any President, whether it is a \nRepublican President or President not of my party, will get a fair \nhearing and a vote, up or down. In fact, when I ran for office, I \nanswered a question in one of the debates, and I said I would use the \nsame standard to judge a nominee from the President of another party as \nI would to judge a nominee from President Bush. That is what I think we \nwere elected to do.\n  If we can just get past what happened yesterday, if we can stop \ntalking about who said what to whom and when, then we can kind of move \non here to act fairly, act deliberately, and, by the way, act with \ngreat respect for this Constitution that we all love.\n  I heard a wonderful discourse from the Senator from New York \nyesterday about the Constitution. I love the Constitution. What we are \nasking for Mr. Estrada is follow the dictates of the Constitution.\n  Does the Senator from Pennsylvania have a question?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I ask the Senator from Minnesota to yield for a \nunanimous consent request.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. I yield for that purpose.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 1 p.m. \ntoday, the Senate stand in recess subject to the call of the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, I ask my friend from \nMinnesota through the Chair how much longer he is going to speak \nbecause we do have a Member in the Chamber who wishes to speak.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I say to the Honorable Democratic whip, I \nwill speak not more than 10 minutes if this understanding is accepted.\n  Mr. REID. We have two over here. That leaves only 5 minutes for each \nof them. They have been here waiting for some time.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I say to the Honorable Democratic whip, \nless than 10 minutes. I can move to the other portion of what I was \ngoing to speak about if the Senator from Nebraska seeks the floor.\n  Mr. REID. If my friend would be kind enough to divide the remaining \n20 minutes between Senator Nelson of Nebraska and Senator Stabenow of \nMichigan?\n  Mr. COLEMAN. I have no problem with that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is that proposed as a unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Mr. REID. It is.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request of the \nSenator from Pennsylvania?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Is there objection to the request of the Senator from Nevada?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Authority for Committee to Meet\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I further ask unanimous consent that the Committee on \nthe Judiciary be authorized to meet to conduct a markup past the hour \nof 1 o'clock.\n  Mr. REID. On behalf of Senator Kennedy, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. In deference to my colleagues, the Senators from \nNebraska and Michigan, I will shorten my comments with regard to the \nEstrada nomination.\n  I want to say this to America. I hope they are listening. They should \nbe listening. These are important times. What my colleagues on the \nother side are doing by engaging in this filibuster is really changing \nthe constitutional standard. And we love this Constitution. It talks \nabout the Senate's role in providing advice and consent. In practice \nthat has always meant 51 votes--a majority. The Constitution \nspecifically lays out when a super majority is needed. What we are \nwitnessing now is a change in the way we abide by this important \ndocument, where we will now require 60 votes to get our nation's judges \nconfirmed. That is not good for America, and that is certainly not what \nour Founders wanted to do.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                   Urgent Needs for Hometown Security\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to speak, once again, about \nthe urgent needs in our local communities for hometown security--\nefforts for us to support local police and firefighters and emergency \nmedical workers, including those in our local emergency rooms at our \nhospitals. These people are on the front lines of any terrorist attack \nthat our citizens may face in the days or weeks or months ahead.\n  Many of us have been talking, since just after 9/11, about the \nimportance of partnering with local communities, and that it is not \nenough to ask our local sheriffs, firefighters, police officers, and \nothers in the communities, to assume this additional set of duties \nrelating to national security without having the support and assistance \nof the Federal Government.\n  I commend all of my colleagues and the President for coming together \nto make sure our men and women in the armed services have what they \nneed at this critical time. We have come forward with substantial \nincreases in the Department of Defense, and I am sure we will continue \nto do so.\n  But when it comes to the home front, we have not yet done what needs \nto be done. There is a growing sense of urgency and bewilderment in our \ncommunities here at home about why this has not occurred and why the \nPresident is not supporting the efforts that we have put forward.\n  I have been holding meetings around Michigan--I believe eight \ndifferent meetings now--from Detroit to Macomb County, Oakland County; \nI was in Port Huron, MI, on Monday; on over to Lansing and Kalamazoo, \nand all the way up to Marquette in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan--and \nI hear the same thing over and over: We need help purchasing updated \nradio equipment; we can't talk to one another; the city versus the \ncounty or county to county. In some cases, in smaller communities, the \nfire department cannot talk to the police department. We need a better \ndispatch system. We need better communications systems. We need, \nfrankly, to be doing this on a statewide and national basis. But the \ncommunities do not have the resources to do it alone.\n  We hear about training, not only having a trainer come in--whether it \nis for bioterrorism, whether it is other types of training that is \nneeded--but we are hearing from local law enforcement and others that \nwhen you have a training certification, and you take 10 police officers \naway from their normal duties of patrolling our streets and keeping the \ncitizens safe, and they sit in training, no matter how important it is, \nthe police chief still has to replace those 10 officers so the citizens \nremain safe while that is happening, while the training is occurring. \nThat takes additional dollars.\n  There are multiple costs to training that we need to be supporting in \norder to be able to get this done as quickly as possible and as \nthoroughly as possible. And certainly we need additional personnel, \ndifferent kinds of personnel, in our local communities.\n  I am sure my colleagues have received many letters. I have received \nmany letters in addition to the personal conversations that I have had \nwith people across Michigan. Let me share parts of a couple letters \nfrom mayors in Michigan.\n  The mayor from the city of Birmingham wrote to the President and sent \nme a copy:\n\n       Mr. President, I am writing to express my deep concern that \n     funding for first responders promised nearly a year ago has \n     still not been provided to America's cities, towns and \n     villages. As you know, the nation's local municipalities have \n     carried the burden for homeland security during the 15 months \n     since the September 11 attacks, with only the promise of \n     federal support.\n\n  This was written back in December.\n\n\n[[Page S2380]]\n\n\n       The absence of federal funding for police, firefighters and \n     emergency response staff has been a disappointment for many \n     city leaders across the country as their concerns were voiced \n     at the recent National League of Cities conference held \n     earlier this year.\n\n  I have a similar letter that has come from the mayor of Cadillac, in \nnorthern Michigan, again expressing grave concerns and saying:\n\n       At the recent National League of Cities conference in Salt \n     Lake City, city leaders from across the country voiced their \n     deep disappointment regarding the absence of federal funding \n     for police, firefighters and emergency response staff.\n\n  The city of Fenton, in Michigan, the city of East Lansing, in my own \nhome county--mayors, county officials, police chiefs, sheriffs--and of \nboth parties; this is not Republican and Democrat; this is not urban \nand rural; this is not a question of one part of the country against \nanother--everyone, every community is saying this same thing.\n  I am deeply concerned not only about past actions but what is \noccurring right now in this current budget bill that we will have in \nfront of us tomorrow.\n  Let me, first, indicate and remind us that last summer we passed an \nemergency supplemental that included $2.5 billion, passed by the Senate \nwith bipartisan support, passed by the House with bipartisan support, \nand sent to the President, an emergency supplemental including $2.5 \nbillion for local communities. It was on the President's desk. All he \nhad to do was sign it. And he would not declare it as an emergency and \nwould not sign it and release the funds.\n  We have come back again and again. Twice this last month, in January, \nSenator Byrd stood in this Chamber and eloquently spoke about the needs \nof communities and first responders. Again, we could not get the \nsupport.\n  And now in the omnibus budget bill that will be coming before us, \ndespite a unanimous Senate appropriations vote back last July on a \nseries of items that deal with transportation security, border \nsecurity, community policing, Federal emergency management, firefighter \ngrants, equipment and communications, emergency operations, port \ncontainer security--and on and on and on--we now have in front of us a \nbill that, in fact, will cut from that amount supported unanimously by \nthe Senate Appropriations Committee $4.4 billion from homeland security \nfrom what we passed, what the Appropriations Committee passed and \nrecommended to us last summer based on the needs presented to them from \ncommunities.\n  We could go down the list. I am deeply concerned when I see the cuts \nin community policing, the firefighter grants, the inoperable \ncommunications equipment grants, which I am hearing so much concern \nabout, emergency operations, et cetera.\n  It is time for us to act. It is time for us to hear what our \ncommunities are saying. I urge my colleagues to join with us in making \nsure we truly keep our communities safe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/13/senate-section/article/S2380-1", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2380]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECESS SUBJECT TO THE CALL OF THE CHAIR\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

ESTRADA, OF VIRGINIA, TO BE UNITED STATES \n     CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Edwards pertaining to the introduction of the \nlegislation are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on \nIntroduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I will discuss the topic on the floor, the \nnomination process.\n  It is interesting the Senator from North Carolina has a bill he \nthinks is important and probably is important, yet questions are not \nable to move forward on any of those bills because we are tied up in \ndoing something that is not at all useful, not at all productive, but \nit continues. Those important things we have to do are not being done, \nand as a matter of fact will not be done, apparently, for some time.\n  I rise more to talk a little bit about the disappointment I have in \nthe process in which we find ourselves. There is not much point in \ntalking about the nominee, Mr. Estrada. He has been talked about \nforever. I can't think of another thing that could be said that has not \nalready been said. What we can do is talk a little about the process \nbeing created. Talk about the obstruction that is taking place and the \nCongress that is faced with a great many important issues we need to \nget considered.\n  We all recognize in any issue, particularly of a nominee, it is \nperfectly legitimate that people have different points of view. That is \nnot unusual. Indeed, that is the way it ought to be. It also is \nappropriate for people to come to the floor after the committee has \nacted and to share those points of view and to do whatever they feel \nappropriate to try and convince others to share that point of view. \nThat is the way it is supposed to be. Finally, after that is done in a \nreasonable limit of time, we have a vote, an up-or-down vote, so those \nwho feel one way can vote one way, those who feel the other can vote \nthe other. Not a very unusual process. On the contrary, it is the very \nwell-accepted process.\n  That is not what has happened here. That is not what has happened.\n  As has been said before, it is time to move forward. It is time to \nmove on. It is time to deal with the dozens of other important issues \nout there for this country and for the people of this country, issues \nthat to people in the country are much more meaningful and have more to \ndo with their business and welfare than we have here. I cannot imagine \nthere is more to say from the other side of the aisle in opposition. \nThey are opposed; fine. That is fine. They are able to convince anyone \nelse? I don't think so. We have been working on this for about a week. \nIt looks as if we will be here some more.\n  It is very disappointing for those who would like to do things that \nare most important to do. Among other things, of course, the White \nHouse has responded. The letter was sent to the President renewing the \nrequest to him for confidential judicial memoranda that have never \nbefore been released. The response of Mr. Gonzales, the counselor to \nthe President, basically indicates they respect the Senate's \nconstitutional role in the confirmation process, and they agree the \nSenate must make an informed judgment consistent with the traditional \nrole and practices. However, requests for these kinds of papers have no \npersuasive support in history and the precedent of judicial \nappointments. It is not there. It has not been done.\n  Relevant history and procedures convincingly demonstrate that would \nbe shifting standards. There is no basis for doing that.\n  In conclusion, the President's counselor said: Miguel Estrada is a \nwell-qualified, well-respected judicial nominee with very strong \nbipartisan support. Based on our reading of history, we believe you \nhave ample information about this nominee and have had more than enough \ntime to consider questions about his qualifications and his ability. We \nurge you to stop the unfair treatment and the filibuster and allow an \nup-or-down vote to confirm Mr. Estrada.\n  I agree with that. Certainly, that is the case. I am not here to talk \nabout the legal aspects of it, just the operational aspects of it, and \nmake it clear, this man was before the committee from 10 in the morning \nuntil 5 in the evening, answering all the questions, answered written \nquestions subsequent to that, and we continue to carry on with it.\n\n[[Page S2381]]\n\n  It is interesting that a number of newspapers throughout the country \nwho generally do not get very involved in these things have in this \ncase. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch editorial, entitled ``A Filibuster is \nNo Fix,'' said:\n\n       Democrats are trying to decide whether to filibuster the \n     nomination of Miguel Estrada to the powerful federal appeals \n     court for the District of Columbia. They consider Mr. Estrada \n     a stealth conservative who is being groomed for the U.S. \n     Supreme Court as a Hispanic Clarence Thomas. The Democrats' \n     fear may turn out to be valid. But the filibuster is the \n     parliamentary equivalent of declaring war. Instead of \n     declaring war, the Democrats should sue for peace and try to \n     fix the process.\n\n  That is the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.\n  The Atlanta Journal-Constitution:\n\n       Miguel Estrada, a Harvard-educated lawyer who has argued 15 \n     cases before the Supreme Court, is well qualified for the \n     federal appellate bench. Democrats, who are threatening to \n     stall a vote on this confirmation, are choosing the wrong \n     target.\n\n  The Florida Times-Union:\n\n       If the system were functioning as the founders intended, \n     Miguel Estrada would be confirmed quickly to the federal D.C. \n     Circuit Court of Appeals.\n       He is extremely qualified in both education and \n     experience--and the American Bar Association unanimously \n     ordered its highest possible rating.\n\n  We heard all that. We know that.\n  People out in the country are saying this is not the right process. \nWe have been through this. We have had enough. We need something \ndifferent.\n  The Tampa Tribune:\n\n       Leading the charge are committee members picked by the \n     Democratic leadership precisely because of their ideological \n     bent. Until the new Congress was seated, they thought nothing \n     of thwarting the constitutional mandate that gives the \n     Senate--the full Senate--the advise and consent power over \n     the judicial nominations.\n\n  So it goes on, and most remarks are very similar all over the \ncountry. The Washington Post, not known for its conservatism, \nparticularly, has indicated this is not the way. This nomination in no \nway deserves a filibuster.\n\n  It is not just being talked about here, it is pretty much all over \nthe country.\n  I go back to the point I made in the beginning, that we have a lot of \nthings to do. We are supposed to be dealing now, and hopefully, today \nor tomorrow, we will deal with the 11 appropriations that were not \npassed last year. We have been operating almost half of this year on \nCRs, instead of doing what we are supposed to do with appropriations.\n  Certainly, as the Senator discussed, we have homeland security at a \nnew threat level. I can't imagine people in the country are thinking \nmore about this nomination than they are about terrorism and homeland \nsecurity and the economy and health care and pharmaceuticals. Where do \nyou suppose this would rate among those things? Or national energy \npolicy, which again we didn't do last year because it was pulled out of \nthe committee.\n  We had a pretty dysfunctional Congress last time. Now we have a \nchance to move forward and do some things, and we are blocking \nourselves by carrying on this kind of conversation.\n  Mr. Estrada has had a full hearing, under both Republican and \nDemocrat control. There is nothing left to say. It is time to come to \nthe snubbing post and decide for or against. It is time to have an up-\nor-down vote. We have been considering this nominee since last week. \nObviously, it is becoming nothing more than a delaying tactic. We owe \nthe nominee, we owe ourselves, we owe the American people a decision, \nand then to move on to all those other issues that confront us.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I concur with everything just stated by \nSenator Thomas. We have been debating this nomination, now, for over a \nweek. As a new Member of this body, and as a new member of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, I have a difficult time understanding, as a \nlawyer, why the delay when you have an individual who has the \nqualifications this man has, who has the legal background this man has, \nwho has the legal training this man has--both from an educational \nstandpoint as well as a practical standpoint, having practiced law.\n  He clerked for a judge. He was involved with the Government side of \npracticing law, being in the Solicitor General's Office. He argued \ncases at the appellate level, at every appellate level all the way to \nthe U.S. Supreme Court. He has been very successful at every level in \nhis judicial career. Why, just from a purely legal standpoint, we have \nnot already moved to a vote on this man is just beyond me.\n  But it goes a little further than that. Miguel Estrada is a true \nsuccess story. He is a man who, if anybody ever lived the American \ndream, is living it. He is a man who, at 17 years of age, came to the \nUnited States from Honduras speaking very little English. He is a man \nwho was not self-taught but who entered the educational system in this \ncountry and took advantage of that educational system, just the way all \nAmericans subscribe to do.\n  This man not only had a great academic record but he went on to law \nschool at Harvard University and was editor in chief of the Law Review.\n  As a law school student at the University of Tennessee--where the \nPresiding Officer formerly served as president--I did not make the Law \nReview. I worked hard, but I didn't quite get there. But here is a man \nwho achieved great success. Anybody who is editor in chief of the Law \nReview at any school of law is the most outstanding student in his \nclass at that law school--in almost every situation. Miguel Estrada \nachieved that pinnacle in his education career.\n\n  He then went on to clerk for a judge, and not just any judge, he \nclerked for a judge at a very high level. Then, as I said, he went to \nwork for the Federal Government, as an assistant to the Solicitor \nGeneral, not just in a Republican administration but also in the \nClinton administration.\n  So he is not a judge who should be perceived in any way as an \nactivist, particularly a conservative activist. I don't look at other \ngraduates of this great institution, graduates from Harvard, who are \nparticular activists. They are good solid citizens, but they are not \nconservative activists, certainly. To perceive Miguel Estrada as an \nactivist--I have heard him so characterized--certainly doesn't fit the \nman when you look at his background.\n  I want to highlight a few things about Miguel Estrada. He is truly an \nAmerican success story who represents the mainstream of American law \nand American values. He came to this country, at age 17, an immigrant \nfrom Honduras, speaking very little English. He has risen to the top of \nhis profession, a magna cum laude graduate of Harvard Law School, law \nclerk to Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, Federal prosecutor in \nNew York, Assistant to the Solicitor General of the United States for 1 \nyear in the Bush administration and for 4 years in the Clinton \nadministration, and leading appellate lawyer at a national law firm.\n  Miguel Estrada has argued 15 cases before the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States, including 1 case in which he represented a death row \ninmate pro bono.\n  He has strong bipartisan support from prominent Democrats, including \nmany high-ranking officials in the Clinton administration such as Ron \nKlain, Seth Waxman, Bob Litt, and Randy Moss.\n  The American Bar Association unanimously rated Miguel Estrada well-\nqualified. That is its highest possible ranking.\n  Miguel Estrada has strong support in the Hispanic community, \nincluding from LULAC, the Hispanic National Bar Association, the U.S. \nHispanic Chamber of Commerce, and numerous other Hispanic \norganizations. This is truly a very historic appointment.\n  If confirmed, Estrada would be the first Hispanic ever to serve on \nthe DC Circuit Court. Many consider the DC Circuit Court to be the \nsecond most important Federal court in America. Miguel Estrada's \nnomination has been pending now since May 9, 2001. We should bring this \nnomination to the floor of this body and let it go for an up-or-down \nvote.\n  Those who have been very vocal and emotional and very passionate, \npleading against the confirmation of Miguel Estrada, will have their \nday. They can vote no. But this man, and America, deserves to have a \nvote on this very well qualified lawyer, and a very well qualified man.\n  Those of us who believe strongly that Miguel Estrada should be \nconfirmed will also have our day. We will have our opportunity to stand \nup and say: You have earned this, Mr. Estrada. You\n\n[[Page S2382]]\n\nhave earned the right, not just to have your nomination brought to the \nfloor of the Senate, but we think you have earned the right to be \nconfirmed to the Circuit Court for the District of Columbia.\n  You have been here in America for now over 25 years. We think you \nhave worked hard to achieve the educational benefits that have been \nafforded to you. We think you have worked hard to come from a very \nlowly--not necessarily menial background, because I don't know all the \ndetails of his background, but I know Honduras is a very poor country. \nI know he started out with a very rough, hard life before he came to \nAmerica--and probably for awhile after he got here.\n  But he has taken advantage of the opportunities that were presented \nto him, the same opportunities that everybody in this body has had over \nthe years, to achieve an education and a profession in America--\nAmerica, the land of the free and the home of the brave. This man chose \nto come to our country and abide by all of the laws, take advantage of \nthe opportunities that were afforded to him, and he has done that. He \nhas achieved great success.\n  Everybody who has written in support of him and from the standpoint \nof folks who have worked with him, both Republicans and Democrats, have \nsaid two things consistently about this man.\n  First, from an intellectual standpoint, he is second to none. He has \nall of the intellect necessary that would be required of any member of \nthe bench.\n  The second thing that has been said about him by every individual \nRepublican or Democrat that has written and who he worked for is that \nthis man is one of the hardest working men and one of the most \ndedicated men they have ever had in their employment. That is true, \nirrespective of whether it is the law firm in which he has worked, \nwhether it is the judges he has clerked for, or whether it is the \nindividuals in the Office of the Solicitor General for whom he worked. \nThey have been very consistent in stating that this man deserves to be \nconfirmed by this body.\n  We have just had another hearing this morning on another set of \njudges before the Judiciary Committee. I went to the meeting this \nmorning with the idea that we were going to vote out a minimum of three \njudges who have been appointed by President Bush for circuit courts in \ndifferent parts of the country. When I got to that meeting today, it \nbecame very obvious that the same folks who are opposing Miguel \nEstrada's confirmation on the floor of the Senate did not want those \nnominees to be voted out of the Judiciary Committee today. We did, in \nfact, wind up voting out 1 nominee, but we left on the table probably \n8, 9, or 10 other judges who should have been voted out. There was no \nreason not to vote those judges out.\n  But once again, it was a dilatory tactic being imposed on the \njudicial system in this country by the same folks who are now opposing \nMiguel Estrada within the Judiciary Committee who decided we should not \nvote those nominees out.\n  I just do not think that is right. I don't think that is the real \nsystem that our forefathers intended us to operate under when it comes \nto the appointment of judges to the Federal bench in this country.\n  I say in closing that I am overwhelmed by the opportunity to serve \nthe people of my State in this great institution. I am in awe of the \nindividuals with whom I serve here on both sides of the aisle who I \nknow are very passionate. They are here for the same reason I am here; \nand that is, to make America a better place for us and for our children \nto live.\n  But I don't understand sometimes why we take issues such as the \nconfirmation of Miguel Estrada and delay and delay and delay and \nobstruct and obstruct and obstruct at a time in the history of our \ncountry when we are fighting to win the war on terrorism--when we are \nliterally under siege.\n  If you go outside today on the streets of Washington, DC, you see \npolice cars on virtually every corner with their lights flashing \nindicating they are on high alert. At a time in the history of our \ncountry when we are on the brink of possibly going to war and putting \nyoung men and women who wear the uniform of the United States of \nAmerica in harm's way, I just don't understand. And the people who are \ncalling my office don't understand why we are not dealing with issues \nof that nature instead of seeing the obstructionist attitude that is \ntaking place on the floor of the Senate.\n  I certainly hope we are able to conclude this debate which has been \nlong lasting now for over a week. There has been much said on both \nsides of the aisle about this man. I think it is time to bring the \nnomination of Miguel Estrada to a vote. Let those folks who have been \nvocal and have been emotional cast their vote in the way they think is \nproper and let those of us who believe--I think a majority of us do \nbelieve--he is qualified and he ought to be confirmed have a vote to \nconfirm Miguel Estrada to the Circuit Court for the District of \nColumbia.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the nomination \nwhich, sadly, strikes me as, frankly, an arrogant nomination and an \nanticonstitutional nomination of Miguel Estrada to be the very first \n``secret'' judge ever nominated for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia, or for any other court in the Federal system.\n  Over the past few days we have had a considerable amount of debate on \nthis nomination. While I believe the debate has been good, I have been \ntroubled by several of the accusations put forward about the nature of \nthe opposition to the nomination of Mr. Estrada. I wanted to come to \nthe floor today to discuss this nomination.\n  Let me set the record straight about what this debate is about and \nwhat it is not about.\n  First, this debate is not about obstructing President Bush's judicial \nnominee. Under Senator Leahy's leadership, Democrats have had a \nremarkable record of approving President Bush's nominees to the Federal \ncourt. While Democrats controlled the Senate, we confirmed more than \nsix nominees per month. The rate of confirmations by the Republican-led \nSenate was much lower in comparison--3.2 nominees confirmed per month \nduring the 104th Congress; 4.25 nominees confirmed per month during the \n105th Congress; and 3.04 nominees confirmed per month during the 106th \nCongress. In fact, the Democrat-led Senate confirmed more nominees in 1 \nday than the Republican majority confirmed during the entire 1996 \nsession.\n  On November 14, 2002, the Senate confirmed 18 judicial nominees. In \n1996, the Republican majority allowed only 17 district court judges to \nbe confirmed and did not confirm a single circuit court nominee.\n  Some of the outrage and some of the expressions of self-\nrighteousness, if you will, strike me as badly put.\n  Personally, I have voted for more than 98 percent of President Bush's \njudicial nominees--98 percent--including three judges who were \nunanimously confirmed earlier this week--all conservative Republican \njudges, no doubt, with my support and my vote.\n  The record demonstrates our commitment to move qualified nominees \nquickly through the hearing process and to have a vote on the floor in \norder to fill the backlog of vacancies on the Federal bench that was \ncreated, frankly, by a failure to confirm President Clinton's judicial \nnominees.\n  Let me also state--I am saddened this has to be even raised in this \nChamber--that this debate is not about race. I have heard some \ncolleagues say the only reason the Democrats are opposed to Mr. \nEstrada's nomination is that he is Hispanic. Nothing could be further \nfrom the truth. Closer examination of the facts reveals what I think \neverybody knows; that is, the Democrats have a solid record when it \ncomes to approving Latino candidates to the bench. In fact, 80 percent \nof the Hispanic appellate judges currently serving were appointed by \nPresident Clinton.\n  During the 107th Congress, Democrats held hearings and swiftly \nconfirmed six of President Bush's Hispanic judicial nominees--six of \nPresident Bush's Hispanic judicial nominees approved by a Democratic \nSenate.\n  Using race as an issue in this debate is a red herring. And that is a \nkind way to put it. To understand this, you have to only look at the \never-growing list of Hispanic organizations that have expressed their \nstrong opposition to Mr.\n\n[[Page S2383]]\n\nEstrada's nomination--the Hispanic organizations that have expressed \ntheir opposition to Mr. Estrada as a ``secret'' nomination. These \ngroups include the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, the Mexican American \nLegal Defense Fund, the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, and the \nPuerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund, to name but a few.\n  To claim that Democrats oppose Mr. Estrada's nomination based on his \nrace is offensive, and it is not worthy of the great traditions of this \nSenate.\n  So if the opposition to Mr. Estrada's nomination is not about \nobstructing President Bush's judicial nominees or about race, then what \nis this debate about? Simply put, it is about the constitutional duties \nof the Senate.\n  When I was sworn in to this Senate, with great pride, great \nconviction, I swore an oath to God to uphold the Constitution of the \nUnited States. Article II, section 2, of the U.S. Constitution gives \nthe President the power to appoint judges with the ``Advice and Consent \nof the Senate.'' I take this responsibility very seriously.\n  The Senate is not a rubberstamp for the nominations of a President--\nRepublican or Democrat. The Senate has a coequal role to play in the \napproval of nominees from a President. The Constitution requires this \nbody to play that role.\n  I must follow my constitutional duty to carefully scrutinize each \nnomination as it comes before the Senate. I render my best judgment as \nto whether or not the individual is fit and qualified to serve on the \ncourt to which he or she has been nominated.\n  In order to make that judgment, I rely on material provided to the \nSenate Judiciary Committee by the nominee, his or her legal record, and \nindependent analysis of outside organizations, such as the American Bar \nAssociation. In addition, I use the statements and responses to \nquestions put to the nominee during his or her confirmation hearing. \nAll of these sources allow me to make an informed decision on each \nnominee's qualifications to serve.\n  I have attempted to follow this process as I have examined Mr. \nEstrada's nomination, as I have the dozens and dozens and dozens of \nprevious President Bush nominees for whom I have voted, conservative \nRepublican judges, and I voted for them with pride.\n  But throughout my time in the Senate, I have never seen a nominee \nwith more of a stealth record than Mr. Estrada. Despite a full hearing \nby the Senate Judiciary Committee, there is simply not enough \ninformation about Mr. Estrada's judicial views for me to be able to \nfulfill my responsibility of advice and consent.\n  Let me take a few moments to outline Mr. Estrada's failure--utter \nfailure--to provide the information necessary to confirm his nomination \nto the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.\n  We are talking here not about a Cabinet position, a political \nposition that will come and go. We are talking about the approval of an \nindividual for a lifetime appointment, someone who will serve in the \nsecond highest court of the land for the rest of the lifetimes of many \nof us here in this body.\n  First, during his confirmation hearing, Mr. Estrada refused to \ncomment on a single Supreme Court case. Now, this is an individual who \nhas never served on the bench and so has no record on the bench. He has \nnot been an academic scholar, so he has no writings that are publicly \navailable for anybody to review.\n  Most other nominees have long experience either on the bench or in \nacademia, and we can examine their record with great scrutiny. I may \napprove or disapprove of their views on one thing or another, but at \nleast I know what their views are. And overwhelmingly I have voted for \nthem because I knew what their views were. I may have disagreed with \nsome of their views but, nonetheless, found them to be competent, \ncapable individuals for whom I could vote.\n  But in this instance, Mr. Estrada refused, and has no other record, \nand refused to comment on a single Supreme Court case. While I \nunderstand that nominees often do not like to comment on cases and \nissues that one day may be appear before them--and I understand that, \ncertainly--Mr. Estrada refused to give the committee a single example \nof a Supreme Court decision that he disagreed with throughout the \nentire history of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n  Mr. Estrada may not want to create a record for himself by stating \nhis views on a controversial case such as Roe v. Wade--I understand \nthat--but did his coaching to avoid answering questions include \ncommenting on, say, the Dred Scott case? Rather than addressing the \nissue, he simply refused to give the committee an answer.\n  Several attempts were made by members of the Judiciary Committee to \nget Mr. Estrada to elaborate on his approach to legal issues. Despite \nbeing asked specific questions about his judicial philosophy, he \nrefused to give the committee an answer--refused. Even when asked to \nname a single judge--living or dead--whom he admires or would like to \nemulate, he refused to give the committee an answer.\n  Finally, members of the Judiciary Committee have asked Mr. Estrada to \nprovide the Senate with legal memos or other analysis which he has \nprepared in the past and which could possibly shed some light on his \njudicial thinking. So far, Mr. Estrada has refused to provide this \nadditional information as well.\n  One of our colleagues has argued that this request for information is \nmerely a delaying tactic or beyond what is truly needed to confirm Mr. \nEstrada. Yet our Republican friends had no problems asking Democratic \njudicial nominees for extensive documentation. This included asking \nMarsha Berzon, nominated to the Ninth Circuit, for the minutes to every \nsingle meeting of the California ACLU during her entire membership \nperiod with that organization. It was argued, then, that such \ninformation was required by the Senate to be diligent in examining the \nqualifications of judicial nominees.\n  If this type of information was necessary to confirm judges in the \npast, I believe it is fair to ask Mr. Estrada to supply enough \ninformation to the Senate to help us understand his judicial \nphilosophy. No stealth judges. No secret judges.\n  Conservative Republican judges? Yes, of course. President Bush is \nPresident of the United States. He is our President. He has the \nopportunity and the authority to nominate these individuals to the \nbench. And they have been overwhelmingly approved by this Senate, \nDemocrats and Republicans alike. That is not the question.\n  The question is, What kind of precedent are we going to set to begin \nto approve individuals to lifetime appointments to the bench while \nhaving utterly no concept of where the individual is in terms of his \njudicial philosophy?\n  Mr. Estrada may well be qualified to serve on the U.S. Court of \nAppeals. He may well be qualified. Unfortunately, it appears he has \nbeen coached, he has been advised to say nothing, to elude all \nquestions, and to avoid providing the Senate with any information that \nwould help us to construct an opinion about his thoughts on judicial \nissues.\n  I ask each of my colleagues to consider the precedent we will set for \nfuture Presidents, future nominees, and, indeed, for this Senate if we \nconfirm a nominee who has refused to provide the Senate with sufficient \ninformation. I fear it is a step toward making the Senate merely a \nrubberstamp for this or any other President's nominations and would, in \nfact, be an abrogation of our constitutional duties.\n  We swore an oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States, not \nto surrender the role of the Senate's responsibilities for advice and \nconsent. The precedent that would be set here would lead to a \ncircumstance where Presidents, perhaps of both political parties, in \nthe future would routinely nominate people to the bench who had some \nideological ax to grind, some out-of-the-mainstream judicial views, but \nwho had never sat on the bench before. It would be considered to be a \ndisadvantage to have served on the bench before. It would be considered \nto be a disadvantage to have been a scholar and written about your \nviews. And we would wind up getting a succession of these stealth \ncandidates who had no record and who also, on top of that, refused to \nrespond to the Senate relative to their judicial philosophy. This would \nbe catastrophic to the integrity of the Federal bench.\n  Unless we are able to get more complete information, I will vote \nagainst Mr. Estrada. My vote is not based on\n\n[[Page S2384]]\n\nrace. I am proud to have voted for Hispanic nominee after Hispanic \nnominee. That is not the question. Nor is it an attempt to block \nPresident Bush's nominees because I am proud of the dozens and dozens \nand dozens of President Bush nominees for whom I also have voted.\n  Even though I may have disagreed to some extent with their political \nand judicial philosophy, at least I understood where they were coming \nfrom, and I knew what they were. They seemed to be, in my best \njudgment, largely in the mainstream of contemporary American \njurisprudence.\n  I will vote against Mr. Estrada because I believe it would make a \nmockery of my constitutional obligation for advice and consent to \nconfirm a nominee to a lifetime appointment to the appellate bench, the \nsecond highest court in the land, who has refused to answer basic \nquestions and who has no record. What a precedent, what an ugly \nprecedent it would be for this Nation to accept that. This Senate \ndeserves better. The American people deserve better.\n  I lay before my colleagues my rationale for taking this position on \nthis particular individual. It is my hope that never again will we see \nthis kind of stealth, secret process, this assumption that the Senate \nwill abrogate its advice and consent obligations brought before this \nbody.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from Alaska.\n\n\n                      Tongass Land Use Management\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the appropriations bill, the omnibus \nbill, as we call it, will be here soon. I wanted to comment about \nstories pertaining to a provision I have in the bill and the change I \nsought to make in it.\n  The Tongass language in this omnibus bill that will come back to the \nSenate is the same language in the bill when it passed the Senate. It \nwas not challenged in the Senate. The language provides that the record \nof decision for the 2003 supplemental environmental impact statement \nfor the 1997 Tongass Land Use Management Plan shall not be subject to \nadministrative appeal or judicial review.\n  During the consideration of the omnibus bill, I did suggest some \nmodification of that language. It led to considerable discussion in the \npress. I might add there are a whole series of provisions in this bill \nas it comes back that were modified in conference by many Senators, \nmany Members of the House of Representatives. The process by which we \ndo that in many ways has been discussed by other Senators. At a later \ntime I want to discuss the process by which Senators comment upon the \nwork of other Members of the Senate.\n  In any event, for instance, in the Los Angeles Times, Senator Boxer \nsaid:\n\n       The stewardship proposal could allow logging of 10 million \n     acres in California if the riders remain in the bill. I \n     intend to discuss them at great length on the Senate floor.\n\n  My amendment did not apply to California at all.\n  The Senator from California also is reported as saying in another \nrelease I have that:\n\n       This is a dangerous backdoor attempt to silence the public, \n     states, and localities, and to stop our citizens from going \n     to court to protest these destructive riders.\n\n  The provision to stop going to court was in the Senate bill.\n  In another article in the Grand Forks Herald, there is this \nstatement:\n\n       The riders would remove Alaska's Tongass and Chugach \n     forests from protection under the national roadless policy \n     and require the Forest Service to offer timber sales to meet \n     market demand regardless of the effects on habitat and the \n     forests' other resources.\n\n  I could go on and on with these articles that are in the papers and \nin the news releases throughout the country.\n  What I want to do is set the record straight on what the situation is \nin the Tongass and how we got where we are today. It is a long saga. It \ntakes a little while to relate to the Senate.\n  In 1997, after 10 years of planning and $13 million of the taxpayers' \nmoney, the Tongass Land Use Management Plan was completed. I opposed \nthat plan because it contained drastic reductions in the timber \nharvest. I thought the levels were much lower than they needed to be. \nThere were numerous scientists who found the Tongass could sustain far \ngreater development support than what was included in the report.\n  Today, just 6 years later, that plan seems like the golden age of the \nTongass timber industry. I now find myself defending that plan, which \nDemocrats and environmentalists then supported because those same \nextreme environmentalists and their friends from the previous \nadministration have done so much damage to Alaska's timber industry \nsince that time.\n  The Tongass Land Use Management Plan reduced the allowable sale \nquantity (ASQ), for the Tongass to 267 million board feet. That is the \nplan I am talking about that we are now defending. Of the allowable 267 \nmillion board feet of timber, less than 220 million board feet would be \neconomically harvestible under the plan. It provided access to only \n676,000 acres of the 17 million acre Tongass National Forest.\n  Furthermore, it established that timber harvesting on Federal land \nwould be managed over 100-year and 120-year rotations. These rotations \nprovided more than enough time for forest revitalization.\n  The Tongass is the only forest in Alaska in which timber may be \nharvested. I call the Senate's attention to this. Our other forest, \nwhich is 5.5 million acres, the Chugach, is under a forest management \nplan which has reduced timber harvesting to zero. This renders the \nChugach forest almost completely closed to logging. There are some \nsmall inholding tracks that could be logged, but none of them are being \nlogged, to my knowledge. Last year less than 1 million board feet of \nsalvageable timber ravaged by disease was sold from the Chugach. There \nis no real commercial harvest there.\n  Many groups and individuals frame the current debate about the \nTongass as an argument about whether or not the forest should be saved. \nThe terms of the 1997 plan made by the Clinton administration make it \nclear that framing the issue this way is very misleading. The 1997 plan \nset aside 93 percent of all forested areas in the Tongass National \nForest in my home State.\n  Under the Tongass amendment I asked Congress to approve, that land \nwill remain completely untouched. It will not touch any of the land, 93 \npercent, that is reserved, set aside. It would remain completely \nuntouched. Clearly the vast majority of the Tongass has already been \nsaved for future generations. Yet they want more. There is 7 percent of \nthe forest that is still open to logging under the agreement made in \n1980.\n  My State's timber industry has experienced a swift decline, \nthreatening thousands of Alaskan families who depend upon that industry \nfor their livelihood. Today timber communities in southeast Alaska have \nbeen devastated by unemployment due in large part to jobs lost in the \ntimber industry. I point out to the Senate this bill we will vote on \ntonight will contain $3.1 billion for the farm community that has been \ndevastated by about a 15 percent reduction in income. My timber \nindustry will receive nothing even though it has been totally \ndevastated by the actions taken by the Clinton administration.\n  The Tongass once supported 4,000 timber jobs. Today two-thirds of \nthose jobs have disappeared, and all of them will disappear if the \nroadless policy is applied to the area set aside for logging in the \nTongass format and the Tongass Land Use plan.\n  In the last 10 years, diseased supply and frivolous lawsuits waged by \nextreme environmental groups have led to the closure of all of our pulp \nmills. There is not a single pulp mill left in Alaska. When those mills \nclosed, they took southeast Alaska's best jobs with them. I hasten to \npoint out, as I said, when farming fell 15 percent, Congress declared a \ndisaster. That is $3.1 billion we put up for the farmers. They are no \ndifferent than loggers. The only difference is, loggers have been \naffected by actions of the Department of Agriculture. It is the \nDepartment of Agriculture that asks us to protect the farmers.\n  The situation in the Tongass has not only cost us thousands of jobs, \nit has also cost the Government valuable tax dollars. The Government \nmay soon have to pay the Alaska Pulp Company $750 million for the \nClinton administration's illegal cancellation of timber contracts in \nthe Tongass. That money should be paid to Alaska's workers.\n  The rapid decline in Alaska's timber industry is due to two main \ncauses: the\n\n[[Page S2385]]\n\nClinton administration's policy barring logging and roadbuilding on \n58.5 million acres of national forest, including the Tongass, and \nfrivolous lawsuits brought by the multibillion-dollar environmental \nlobby in an effort to lock up public resources on public land.\n  First, let me talk about the plan implemented by the Clinton \nadministration's final days in office. When Congress passed the Tongass \nAct in 1947, we set what we called the ASQ level for the Tongass at \n1.38 billion board feet per year. That level was slowly eroded. In \n1980, the level was reduced to 450 million board feet per year under \nthe Alaska National Interest Lands Act. In 1997, the Tongass land \nmanagement plan further reduced the level to 267 million board feet. By \n2001, the harvest level in the Tongass was only 48 million board feet--\nfrom 1.3-plus billion board feet to less than 48 million board feet. \nWhen you talk about a disaster, clearly this drastic reduction is one \nof the most serious disasters for the timber industry.\n  To give my fellow Senators some perspective, Southeast Alaska has \nmore than 18 million acres of forest land, 95 percent of which is in a \nnational forest and only 850 timber jobs left today. Arkansas has 19 \nmillion acres of forest land, 8 percent of which is national forest and \n43,000 timber jobs.\n  Pennsylvania has 17 million acres of forest land, 2 percent of which \nis in a national forest, and 82,000 timber jobs.\n  New York has 19 million acres of forest land, 4 percent of which is \nnational forest, and 51,000 timber jobs.\n  Last year, while Alaska harvested 34 million board feet, New York \nharvested nearly 900 million board feet of timber.\n  This history and disparity between how national forest lands are \nadministered in other States and how they are administered in Alaska \nshows that reductions in the ASQ levels are unfair, unreasonable, and \nunlawful.\n  The 1980 Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act provided the \nproper balance between protecting and preserving Alaska's heritage and \nproviding economic and social opportunities to the people of the State \nof Alaska. That 1980 Act specifically prohibited the changes the \nClinton administration made to the Tongass management plan in 1999. \nSection 708(b) of the 1980 Act specifically states that there will be \nno ``further statewide roadless area review and evaluation of national \nforest systems lands in the State of Alaska'' without the express \nauthorization of Congress--none. We call that one of the ``no more \nclauses.'' That was the one concession Congress gave to us when it \nwithdrew over a hundred million acres of our State for national \ninterest lands and disallowed any type of development by the people of \nthe State of Alaska.\n  Section 1326 of that same act--again, deemed the ``no more clause''--\nprohibits review of any future conservation area greater than 5,000 \nacres without congressional approval. Clearly, the study of the 18 \nmillion acre Tongass was not authorized; it was not previously reviewed \nby Congress.\n  The roadless plan was first announced by the Clinton administration \nin 1999. I hope Senators will listen to this. In the fall of 2000, I \nreceived a call from the Clinton administration assuring me as chairman \nof the Appropriations Committee and the Senator from Alaska that the \nTongass would be excluded from the roadless plan. The proposed rule \nupon which hearings were held specifically excluded Alaska.\n  Let me consider that now, and I hope the Senate will consider it. As \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee, the Clinton administration \nsought my help on many issues in the year 2000 as we considered the \n2001 appropriations bills. I was in a position then to hold them to \ntheir commitment on the roadless areas.\n\n  After the election was over and the appropriations bills had passed, \nPresident Clinton personally applied the roadless plan to the Tongass \nby Executive order. It was not included in the proposed rule upon which \nhearings were held, but at the last minute the President personally \nadded Alaska to the plan.\n  In their rush to lock up Alaska on their way out the door, the \nadministration ignored the concerns of my State, the Alaskan Natives, \nand our timber communities, and they specifically violated the law.\n  Lawsuits brought by extreme environmentalists have created an equally \ntroubling situation. The lawsuits have forced the Forest Service to \nkeep revising its plans. The groups filing these suits are abusing the \nNational Environmental Policy Act, an act which I cosponsored along \nwith Senator Jackson in the 1970s.\n  As a cosponsor, I believe I knew the original intent. When we passed \nthat act, we intended it to be used to assess the environmental impact \nof major Federal decisions. Radical environmentalists have used it to \ncreate an absolute barrier to resource development or commercial use on \nany public lands.\n  Each time we complete an environmental impact study, it costs the \ntaxpayers up to $10 million and locks up public resources for years. In \neffect, this practice has created a class of professional environmental \nlawyers whose only practice is to prevent the utilization of resources \non public lands.\n  I have been a lawyer for 50 years and I have never seen such \ndevelopment. I have never seen such single-minded people who use a law \ndesigned to protect our environment to produce income for themselves, \nat a cost to the taxpayers and the people of this Nation.\n  No one seeks to limit due process or debate on these issues, but the \nextremists have exhausted the time period for a reasonable review \nprocess. I ask colleagues to remember new roadless areas are illegal in \nAlaska under these clauses I have read, unless specifically approved by \nCongress. This would not even be an issue if the Clinton Justice \nDepartment had raised the ``no more clause'' when they defended the \nTongass land management plan in Federal court. Neither did the Federal \ndistrict court judge.\n  Mr. President, I have a letter from the Ketchikan Gateway Borough, \none of our major political subdivisions in Alaska. I ask unanimous \nconsent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                        Ketchikan Gateway Borough,\n\n\n                                Office of the Borough Manager,\n\n                                                    Ketchikan, AK.\n\n     Re: Amendments relating to Tongass timber issues\n\n     Senator Ted Stevens,\n     Hart Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Stevens: On behalf of the Ketchikan Gateway \n     Borough, I would like to thank you for your efforts at \n     bringing closure to what has become a decade long dispute \n     crippling the economy of many Southeast Alaska communities, \n     Ketchikan included.\n       Specifically, with TTRA in 1990, the intent was to bring \n     peace and stability to the timber industry, providing enough \n     timber to meet the demand, and not overproducing and \n     unbalancing normal market forces. The result, however, was an \n     ineffective provision. The phrasing ``seek to meet'' demand \n     was interpreted in a way which resulted in the demand not \n     being met, and led to a downward spiral of ever reduced \n     capacity and employment. Removing the words ``seek to'' from \n     this provision would go a long way toward helping the \n     economies in Wrangell, Ketchikan, Prince of Wales Island, and \n     throughout Southeast Alaska recover from the adverse impacts \n     of the prior error.\n       Second: In addition to the restrictive effect which the \n     ``seek to meet'' language has had on timber supply, the \n     uncertainty caused by protracted litigation over both the \n     1997 ROD and the Roadless Rule issues has brought the timber \n     industry almost to a standstill. It has constricted the \n     timber supply to the point where unemployment is threatening \n     the viability of communities. New investment for more \n     environmentally friendly secondary processing is difficult to \n     secure because of the uncertainty as to timber supply and the \n     effect of litigation on the ability of the Forest Service to \n     put out sales.\n       It has been nearly 6 years since the issuance of the 1997 \n     ROD, a planning document which took nearly a decade to \n     complete. It is time for the decision to be accepted and for \n     people to move on. It will only be a few more years before it \n     is time to begin the next TLMP ROD process. Continuing \n     uncertainty caused by protracted litigation over land use \n     plans is killing the economy in Southeast Alaska. The \n     Ketchikan Gateway Borough has lost nearly 10 percent of its \n     population since 1996, and 2 percent just in the last year. \n     Review of individual sales offers adequate opportunities for \n     appeals if there are issues requiring review.\n       Third: In regard to the Roadless Rule, the whole process \n     was a rushed pre-determined decision. Application of the rule \n     to Alaska, however, stands out as the most significant \n     injustice of the entire process. Throughout the public \n     comment period the proposal was described as clearly not \n     impacting Alaska. It was only after the comments were closed \n     that the final rule was issued to apply to Alaska as well. \n     This is fundamentally unfair and improper. Further, the ``no \n     more'' clause of ANILCA precludes such an action.\n\n[[Page S2386]]\n\n       Even if the process were not flawed, the impacts are \n     drastic and unconscionable. If the Roadless Rule were applied \n     here it would virtually guarantee that there would not be any \n     meaningful timber industry employment in secondary \n     manufacture in Southeast Alaska. The amount of timber \n     available from the largest National Forest would end up as \n     exports in the round and small production of likely less than \n     100 MMBF of sawlogs and chips.\n       Further, the ability to build new infrastructure or even \n     support existing infrastructure, would be jeopardized. If the \n     economy in the area continues with such constriction and \n     uncertainty there will be additional loss of population and \n     continued increases in social problems associated with \n     poverty.\n       The Ketchikan Gateway Borough urges you to use your best \n     efforts to ensure the passage of the riders which address \n     these three issues.\n       Thank you for your attention to this issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Roy Eckert,\n                                                  Borough Manager.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this letter is from Roy Eckert, borough \nmanager, concerning amendments relating to Tongass timber.\n  I want to put into the Record another letter that has been written to \nthe Secretary of Agriculture and signed by Petersburg city council \nmember, of the Recreation/Wilderness Program manager of the Tongass \nNational Forest, Bill Tremblay. It is a factual letter setting forth \nparts of the comments that I have made. I hope Members of the Senate \nwill read it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Dear Secretary, thank you for receiving other members of \n     the Petersburg City Council. I would like to take this \n     opportunity to join my voice with the other council members \n     in noting our strongest opposition to the recently signed \n     Roadless Area Conservation Policy. I take exception to this \n     as a member of the City Council and as a Forest Service \n     employee. Some action is needed to address the devastating \n     impacts of this decision to the captive communities within \n     the boundaries of the National Forests in Alaska, \n     particularly on the Tongass National Forest in southeast \n     Alaska.\n\n\n             the tongass national forest, finding the facts\n\n       The Tongass is almost 17 million acres and is one of the \n     oldest forests in the entire National Forest System. The \n     forest is about the size of West Virginia and has more \n     coastline that the entire west coast in the lower 48. More \n     than 95% is federally owned. The forest has almost 5.8 \n     million acres Congressionally designated as wilderness (19 \n     wilderness areas in all) with another 500,000 acres also \n     designated by Congress for recreation purposes (Land Use \n     Designations II (LUD II) through the Tongass Timber Reform \n     Act of 1990).\n       Attached is some of the literature used by environmental \n     groups to support the Roadless Rule, I'm providing this to \n     highlight some of the misinformation used to solicit \n     comments. National environmental groups continually portrayed \n     all 17 million acres at risk. Of course the result of this \n     effort was the generation of thousands of postcards endorsing \n     the Roadless Rule. Federal courts have ruled that comments to \n     environmental documents must be timely and substantive. \n     Comments cards parroting misstatements of fact are not \n     substantive. Many of these cards were the basis of Chief \n     Dombecks' assertion that ``overwhelming public comments in \n     favor of the Roadless Rule'' supported the decision. \n     Decisions affecting the management of our resources are \n     suppose to be based on science, federal policy, and the \n     ability of the lands to sustain the proposed action. If we're \n     going to use vote counting as a method of management then I \n     doubt we need the current organizational structure for the \n     Forest Service.\n       Just a side note, it was well minded people like these that \n     had the Forest Service respond to the need to protect the \n     ``Mendenhall Penguins'' during the Forest Planning process \n     for the Tongass. Somehow, someone put a message out noting \n     that such creatures existed at the Mendenhall Icefield near \n     Juneau. As a result, there were several hundred letters \n     mailed to the Tongass Land Management Planning Team. I think \n     a lot of the comments received for the protection of the \n     remaining roadless areas on the Tongass were done with just \n     as much understanding of the issues to be addressed.\n       Please review the evaluation of the comments carefully. \n     Before the President's decision, I overheard members of a \n     regional environmental organization talking about how they \n     had the phone number for making comments on his speed dial so \n     they could call every morning. The process set forth in the \n     National Environmental Protection Act (NEPA) is not a voting \n     process. Again, allowing for the accumulation of one \n     opinion from one person doesn't meet the test for a \n     substantive comment.\n\n\n                         Are Forest Plans Dead?\n\n       In 1999 the Tongass National Forest completed a 13 year, \n     $10 million dollar Forest Plan. To resolve the appeals to the \n     Regional Foresters decision, the final decision was taken \n     away from the Chief of the Forest Service and made by then \n     Undersecretary Jim Lyons. In April 2000, a GAO report on the \n     Process Used to Modify the Forest Plan for the Tongass \n     decision showed that this move, while legal, was \n     unprecedented. I'll also note for the record that Mr. Lyons \n     specifically addressed Roadless in his decision.\n       After his decision, Mr. Lyons came to Sitka, Alaska to talk \n     with the mayors of the affected communities, and other \n     community representatives. Mr. Lyons, addressing the mayors \n     on behalf of the administration, assured affected communities \n     that the forest plan would provide guidance for the \n     management of the forest for the next 10 to 15 years. Only a \n     few months later we learned that Mr. Lyons was clearly out of \n     touch with his own administration as the Tongass was to be \n     included in the Roadless Rule. The potential inclusion of the \n     Tongass and Chugach National Forests in the Roadless Rule \n     prompted the Governor of Alaska to publicly announce that the \n     State had been ``stabbed in the back''. The Governor of \n     Alaska is a Democrat and the Republican led State legislature \n     has just voiced their own opposition to the Roadless Rule in \n     passing a bill supporting the Governor's position.\n       Both actions related to the final forest plan decision and \n     the Roadless Rule fly in the face of other rules filed by the \n     administration encouraging more cooperation at a local level \n     in decision making and the delegation of the decision of \n     Forest Plans down to the Forest Supervisor level. I have been \n     looking over priorities of this new administration and have \n     found their focus on local collaboration and participation is \n     also in concert with these ideas.\n       The process used to implement the Roadless Rule places the \n     integrity of the Forest Planning process at risk on a \n     National Scale. The Tongass Plan completed and signed in 1997 \n     by the Regional Forester was environmentally sound, \n     scientifically based and legally defensible. The only flaw in \n     the decision was that it didn't meet the values of members of \n     the past administration. If we are going to have local \n     decisions continually made at the Washington level then we \n     need to resend the new planning regulations and reissue the \n     new procedures to follow to be fair to the public.\n\n\n                       The Roadless Rule Document\n\n       The Roadless Rule FEIS failed miserable in its contents. \n     Many of the points made in the analysis were flawed, \n     inaccurate, incomplete, and not site specific as is required \n     by the CFR's for an environmental analysis. The problems in \n     the analysis should have been identified in the review of the \n     document by the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ). \n     However, since Mr. Frampton was the head of the CEQ at the \n     time, there wasn't concern about the content and more on the \n     outcome. When a delegation of mayors met with Mr. \n     Frampton, Secretary Glickman, and other in early December, \n     it was evident to them that Mr. Frampton clearly was in \n     charge of the process.\n\n\n                       Economic Impacts Analysis\n\n       One example of the poor analysis was in the discussion of \n     the economic impacts of this decision. The document notes \n     that nationally the impacts are not significant. In specific \n     reference to the Tongass, it identifies the loss of almost \n     900 jobs direct and indirect) and an estimated $17 million \n     loss of annual income to the region. The document notes that \n     the passage of the Secure Schools Act, which makes up the \n     loss of forest receipts, will help deflect the impacts. If \n     you examine the trends of the impacts to communities of \n     southeast Alaska over the past 5 years you'll see that the \n     money generated from this Secure School Act only mitigates \n     the impacts from the falling receipts from previous years. It \n     does nothing to address the Roadless Rule. Attached is a \n     better depiction of the impacts of the rule as provided to \n     the CEQ by the State Director of the USDA Rural Development \n     Program. After looking at her comments we can see that the \n     impacts go far beyond just the payments to the State. I did \n     attached the USDA State Director's comments to my response to \n     the final FEIS but I cannot see were these were ever \n     addressed in the document.\n       What is not discussed in the document is how southeast \n     Alaska is unlike other regions in the lower '48 States. \n     Displaced workers in southeast Alaska cannot commute to other \n     nearby communities to look for jobs. Because of the isolation \n     of our communities, people without jobs are more likely to be \n     forced to leave the State.\n       Arguments in favor of the Roadless Rule note that other \n     areas of economic growth available to southeast Alaska, such \n     as tourism and fisheries. Tourism is growing in southeast \n     Alaska but only through the commercialization of communities \n     as though we were a third world entity. More than 80% of the \n     tourism in southeast Alaska comes from large cruise ships. \n     These ships do drop passengers off in communities to \n     participate in shore excursions, but most of these trips are \n     negotiated by contract prior to the season. The free time \n     given to passengers is generally short and allows enough time \n     to these tourists to shop ``locally'' in shops. Many shops, \n     that use to be local, are now largely owned by the tour ship \n     companies. (See the attached Southeast Empire where the \n     Skagway economy is discussed.) The season for this activity \n     occurs is normally from the first of May to the beginning to \n     September (about 120 days). This leaves the other 240\n\n[[Page S2387]]\n\n     days of the year with little to no recreation or tourism \n     economy. May of the service industry workers now follow these \n     companies to other parts of the world to maintain their year \n     round employment. Although there are sales taxes generated \n     and wages generated in the summer season, most of the earned \n     wages leave wit the seasonal workforce so there is a minimal \n     economic multiplier effect. Many communities are now voting \n     in a head tax for these cruise ship passengers to help \n     support the infrastructure of the communities.\n       The Chugach National Forest in southcentral Alaska enjoys \n     almost year round use because of its proximity to the largest \n     population center of the State, available roads, and better \n     winter conditions. Poor weather conditions and little \n     infrastructure for access virtually eliminates tourism travel \n     from October to early May in southeast Alaska. These facts \n     were not presented in the Roadless Rule analysis and should \n     have been.\n       The potential growth in fishing is even bleaker. Glacier \n     Bay National Park in the northern area of southeast Alaska \n     has just recently closed itself to fishing in many places \n     traditionally used. Actions taken by the National Marine \n     Fisheries Service to protect the stellar sea lions put more \n     of our local citizens out of work. Farmed fish from around \n     the world has depressed world salmon prices. Other federal \n     actions are also threatening the fishing and recreation \n     industry. Did you know that one of the mitigations proposed \n     in lieu of breaching the three Snake River dams in Idaho was \n     to stop all troll fishing in southeast Alaska? The troll \n     fisheries are generally small businesses, many of them are \n     guides who came to this business when they lost their lumber \n     jobs because of the decisions by our agency to reduce timber \n     harvesting. While many of these actions are outside the scope \n     of the Roadless Rule decision and our agency, they are \n     federal actions that contribute to the negative cumulative \n     effects to our economy but were never addressed in the \n     analysis.\n       I raised these economic issues in my comments to the Draft \n     Environmental Impact Statement. I cannot say I am satisfied \n     with the results in the FEIS.\n\n\n                     Effects to the Timber Industry\n\n       When I first got to the Tongass in the early 1980's, \n     Congress had mandated that 450 million board feet (MMBF) \n     annually be made available for sale through the Alaska \n     National Interest Lands Conservation Act of 1980 (ANILCA). \n     Most of this timber was required to meet our obligations for \n     the two remaining 50-year timber sale contracts. Volume not \n     tied up in the contacts was also made available to \n     independent timber sale operators. ANILCA also resolved the \n     Alaska native lands settlement and the issue of lands the \n     State of Alaska was entitled to through statehood. The \n     settlement of other land ownership combined with poor timber \n     market conditions never allowed the Forest Service to sell \n     more that about 350 MMBF annually for most of the 1980's.\n       During the initial work in the revision of the Tongass Land \n     Management Plan, Congress modified ANILCA and the timber sale \n     contracts when they passed the Tongass Timber Reform Act in \n     1990 (TTRA). In this action they also removed the 450 MMBF \n     annual timber target required by ANILCA. The final decision \n     for the Forest Plan made by the Regional Forester in 1997 set \n     a timber harvest level of approximately 286 MMBF for the \n     annual allowable sale quantity. This was reduced to \n     approximately 150 MMBF in Mr. Lyons 1999 decision. Mr. Lyons \n     decision protected some roadless areas but has forced the \n     agency to plan for some harvesting other roadless areas to \n     meet the allowable sale quantity. The Roadless Rule decision \n     makes some assumptions that some losses in areas to cut \n     timber might be made up in areas where roads already exist. \n     This statement ignores the 200-year timber rotation put in \n     place by Mr. Lyon's decision for the Tongass. The 200-year \n     rotation will make many of the roaded areas unavailable \n     for timber harvesting for another 160 years.\n       The Roadless Rule decision suggests that some agency \n     funding might be diverted in a way that would benefit \n     communities impacted by the decision. In the 1990's actions \n     were taken by the agency to cancel the two 50-year timber \n     sale contracts on the Tongass. The cancellation of the first \n     contract resulted in a court settlement that made the agency \n     pay $100,000,000 to the contractor and allowed them three \n     years of the contracted timber volume for a transition. The \n     second cancellation has just resulted in a $1.5 billion \n     judgment against our agency. With these financial burdens, \n     what funds are available to help our local communities? The \n     misrepresentation of the facts by this agency alone should be \n     cause enough to find a way to reverse this decision as it \n     impacts the forests in Alaska.\n       To its credit, the agency has taken some steps to address \n     the downward trend of the timber industry. We have encouraged \n     smaller sawmills or advocated for more secondary processing \n     to take place through grants and bringing in consultants. A \n     new veneer plant has just opened in Ketchikan through much \n     encouragement by this agency and several grants. The \n     Ketchikan mill alone can process 135 MMBF annually. There are \n     several other mills in southeast Alaska that also require a \n     minimal amount of volume to stay viable. The Roadless Rule \n     only allows for an estimated 30 MMBF in annual timber sales \n     off of National Forest System Lands. The agency has \n     purposefully deceived communities and businesses with their \n     intent which has resulted in meaningless investments if the \n     Roadless Rule is allowed to stand. Is there any wonder why \n     the timber industry and the State sued the agency over the \n     Roadless Rule decision?\n\n\n                         Predetermined Decision\n\n       More than a week prior to issuing the Draft Environmental \n     Impact Statement for public review, Chief Mike Dombeck \n     addressed Federal Employees noting the accomplishments of the \n     Forest Service. His first statement was; ``You are moving \n     ahead with plans to protect a special resource on our \n     national forests and grasslands--54 million areas of roadless \n     areas.''\n       This statement does several things. First it acknowledges \n     the intent of the administration to protect ALL roadless \n     areas before the public had any chance to comment. Second, \n     the acreage immediately included the Tongass which had just \n     had the roadless issue resolved by Mr. Lyon's decision.\n       It's also interesting to note that the recent Forest \n     Service Strategic Plan for 2000 states the first objective is \n     that, ``we will protect roadless areas through the roadless \n     area conservation policy''. This strategy was mailed to the \n     printer in October, which was a month before the final EIS \n     was available for review by the public. I will also note that \n     the Forest Service Strategic Plan for 2000 was being \n     distributed to field offices prior to the final decision \n     signed by President Clinton. (I got a copy four days to the \n     final decision.) The predetermined way this document was \n     completed makes a mockery of the entire process and opens \n     the question of our agency standards to public ridicule. \n     It specifically calls to question whether or not the \n     comments to the Roadless Rule were being reviewed for \n     content as required by NEPA or just being processed for a \n     response.\n       The line officers within the Forest Service were not \n     briefed about the decision prior to the invitations being \n     sent to environmental groups for the White House signing \n     party. In fact, many our line officers heard of the final \n     decisions through the environmental community before they \n     knew about it from their supervisors.\n       We have spent years getting our communities and \n     constituents to work with us on a local level in forging \n     decisions that affect the resources and their quality of \n     life. To see our objective environmental analysis process \n     used for a political gain is an embarrassment. While there \n     may be some in favor of the rule, many people within and \n     outside of the agency object to the Roadless Rule primarily \n     because the way the decision was made. If asked, Forest \n     Service employees would pass a vote of ``no confidence'' for \n     this Chief.\n\n\n                lack of science in the roadless decision\n\n       We are being told that science played a role in the \n     Roadless Rule decision. When reading this analysis I fail to \n     see where the science was used. In specific reference to the \n     Tongass, what were the measured benefits to the resources \n     provided by the Roadless Rule that were not provided by the \n     1999 decision made by Mr. Lyons? If you were to look at the \n     planning record for the Tongass Land Management Plan, you'd \n     find that there were only minor concerns for resources \n     expressed by the agency in the 1997 decision made by the \n     Regional Forester. Mr. Lyons 1999 decision more than made up \n     for any shortcomings for resource concerns in the 1997 by \n     issuing a decision based more on values than science (Which \n     is still in court). The Roadless Rule provides additional \n     protections but fails to make a case for who or for what? \n     More roadless is more roadless but it has not been \n     demonstrated that it is needed. This again is a flaw in the \n     environmental analysis which should cause it to be \n     overturned.\n\n\n                       local resource management\n\n       As previously noted, this decision was made far away from \n     the field, in an apparent partisan way, without science, and \n     in a way that didn't account for local knowledge. By \n     including the Tongass in the Roadless Rule, the \n     administration acknowledged that they don't trust their \n     employees to manage the 3.5% left to manage for resource \n     development in the 1999 decision from Mr. Lyons. They have \n     also put an end to a very cooperative process that has been \n     ongoing for the management of National Forest Systems lands \n     in Alaska.\n\n\n                               solutions\n\n       From what I can see, this administration has four \n     options: (1) Live with the Roadless Rule; (2) Start the \n     process to revise the Roadless Rule; (3) Have Congress \n     overturn the Roadless Rule; (4) Work on something through \n     the courts.\n       The Roadless Rule can't be ignored because of the \n     tremendous impacts to communities. I'm not sure the Forest \n     Service has the millions of dollars it would take to do \n     another analysis. I also think that the decision might be too \n     controversial to be addressed by Congress that is so closely \n     divided.\n       This leaves the court system to resolve the conflicts over \n     the Roadless Rule. My suggestion to the agency is to accept \n     the lawsuit filed by the State of Alaska and agree to remove \n     the Tongass and Chugach from the Roadless Rule decision.\n       The Roadless Rule decision is harmful to the State of \n     Alaska and doing a single purpose study dealing the agency \n     had gone against provisions specifically prohibiting this \n     action as stated in ANILCA. I know the State of Alaska is \n     willing to pursue this in\n\n[[Page S2388]]\n\n     court because of the impacts this will have on our economy, \n     does our agency want to spend this kind of money defending \n     such an unpopular decision? The agency could cite the cost of \n     the trial, clause of ANILCA it violated, the inadequate \n     evaluation of the impacts in the analysis and find that \n     adequate protection is already provided to the remaining \n     roadless areas of the Tongass through the implementation of \n     the 1999 Tongass decision. With all of the reasons I've \n     presented, I believe the agency has sufficient cause to \n     withdraw the Alaska forests from the Roadless Decision and \n     not defend the decision in the courts.\n\n\n                                closing\n\n       The day the Roadless Rule was signed, I sent a note \n     directly to the Chief. I told him that in my 20 years as an \n     employee that it was the first day I was ever embarrassed to \n     be a Forest Service employee. I have spent most of my career \n     in the Alaska Region and I have never had a cause to feel \n     this way previously. I am proud of what this agency and its \n     employees have accomplished for the benefit of all people in \n     the management of the resources within the State of Alaska. \n     More than just our management of the resources, we bring some \n     tremendous skills to our communities where we participate \n     fully as community members. The partisan way the Roadless \n     Rule was completed goes counter to everything our agency has \n     been trying to build in community trust and involvement over \n     the past 30 years.\n       Some people within the community and at work have \n     questioned my persistence in trying to overturn the Roadless \n     Rule. Speaking as a council member for the community, I feel \n     I have an obligation to make every effort to protect our \n     community from harm. As a Forest Service employee, I just \n     want to be proud of who I work for again.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Bill Tremblay.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I go back to my original statement. I \nhave been here going on 35 years now and I have never seen people make \nstatements that are so unfounded and unfactual about things that I am \ndoing.\n  I am warning the Senate that if Members of the Senate accuse me of \ndoing things that are not proper and they are absolutely unfactual, I \nintend to come here and, on a basis of personal privilege, bring those \nSenators to the floor and demand an apology. This has gone too far. \nSenators are saying my amendment covers 9 million acres. It does not. \nIt protects 1.7 million acres. The reason we are discussing this here \ntoday is that at the last minute, the Clinton administration added my \nState to the roadless rule. Notwithstanding the fact that the Clinton \nadministration called me personally and said Alaska would not be \nincluded in their roadless rule plan because they knew of the \nprovisions of ANILCA. No hearing was ever held on the implications such \na rule would have on Alaska, no hearing was held on the proposal, and \nno request to Congress to include Alaska in the roadless area was ever \nmade. I have never seen anything more deceitful than the conduct of the \nClinton administration in their pursuit of the roadless rule.\n  I intend to pursue this now. I would hope that before my colleagues \nmake statements on the floor or to the media, they review both the \nTongass amendment and the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation \nAct. I am literally warning Senators that we are going to have it out \nhere on the floor of the Senate if they keep accusing me of doing \nsomething which I have not done. That, to me, is a violation of the \nSenate rules.\n  When Judge Singleton ordered the Forest Service to review 9.7 million \nroadless acres, the Forest Service complied. They reviewed the \nPotential wilderness and roadless areas even though it was in direct \nviolation of ANILCA. There wouldn't even be a review if the Clinton \nAdministration had not ignored ANILCA, which specifically prohibited \nsuch review.\n  Alaskans seek two remedies to the current problems with Forest Policy \nin the Tongass. First, we want the Forest Service to uphold the law and \ndeclare the roadless rule in the Tongass an unlawful violation of \nANILCA.\n  Second, we ask that when the Forest Service issues its decision later \nthis year on the Tongass plan, we declare that it is the final decision \non this issue. Judge Singleton's mandate entitled The Environmental \nGroups to a Review, it did not entitle them to a Forest Service \nrecommendation that is favorable to their position. It did not entitle \nthem to hold up the use of public resources indefinitely. We have been \nthrough the process and we all must recognize and abide by the Forest \nService's final ruling.\n  And, if this issue goes before a Federal court again, I expect the \nJudges to uphold the law--especially the specific provision which we \ncall the ``No More Clause.''\n  Alaskans understand the need to conserve our public lands and \nresources better than anyone else. We have protected more land than any \nother country on Earth and more than the other 49 States combined.\n  We were the pioneers of the Nation's last great frontier and our \nlives have always depended on the sustainability of our natural \nresources.\n  Our time in the great wilderness of our State has taught us that man \nforges a fragile pact with his surroundings. He needs the land and its \nresources, but he must also preserve them. That is why my State has \nfought so hard to make sure that our land and waterways and the species \nthat inhabit them will be there for generations to come.\n  Consistent with our commitment to the environment, we have designated \nover 58 million acres as pristine wilderness, which represents 55 \npercent of all wilderness areas in the United States.\n  Because only 1 percent of Alaska's lands are privately owned, it is \nimperative that the Federal Government allow us to use some of our \nresources on the 235 million acres managed by the Federal Government.\n  We will always manage our lands in a way that ensures their vitality. \nTimber is a renewable resource, it can be and will be managed this way \nunder the measures provided in this bill.\n  Much of my State will always be pristine wilderness. But, we need \nsome degree of certainty that we will be able to harvest small portions \nof the forest that is not wilderness. We need to know that we will be \nable to sustain the timber industry we have today. We need assurances \nthat our efforts will not be met with more lawsuits and more \nresistance. In the days ahead I will pursue this subject again and \nagain.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record letters from my \nconstituents and communities who have been severely impacted by the \nlawless actions of the previous administration.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Senator Stevens: This is just a short note to let you know \n     you have huge support for what you are doing with the Tongass \n     riders. You have my support and the support of thousands of \n     Alaskans. Don't consider for a moment that the environmental \n     ``wackos'' represent the majority view of Alaskans. Keep up \n     the great work on this crucial issue. Thanks for a job well \n     done!!\n       Please pass this on to Congressman Young if you get a \n     chance. Thanks. Also, Congressman Young did a great job on \n     the call-in show on APR yesterday.\n                                                     Dave Carlson,\n     Petersburg, AK.\n                                  ____\n\n       Senator Stevens: Thanks for your efforts to get the timber \n     industry back on its feet. The current effort will remove an \n     obstacle that has held back investment and added to the cost \n     to operate. The continuous delay resulting from challenges to \n     the Forest Plan has been one of the industries biggest \n     problems.\n                                                  George Woodbury,\n     Wrangell, AK.\n                                  ____\n\n       Senator Stevens: We in SE Alaska support Senator Stevens \n     and staff in your efforts to pass the Tongass riders. We \n     support the 1997 Tongass plan's determination that no more \n     wilderness is required in the Tongass. We also support the \n     exemption of Alaska from the roadless determination, as \n     originally promised by Clinton. Adequate timber supply is \n     absolutely essential to our Prince of Wales communities and \n     critical to our mill, Viking Lumber, the only viable mil in \n     SE Alaska. Our mill employs 35 year-around and only needs 30 \n     million board feet per year to continue operating. These \n     riders will provide adequate timber for this family-owned \n     mill in the Craig/Klawock area.\n       Please know that we support your efforts and are prepared \n     to speak out if and when needed.\n       Hang in there.\n                                                       Tom Briggs,\n                                                        Craig, AK.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/13/senate-section/article/S2389-1", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2389]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S2389]]\n                    AUTHORIZING COMMITTEES TO REPORT\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

ESTRADA, OF VIRGINIA, TO BE UNITED STATES \n           CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCIUT\n\n                              (Continued)\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, one of the great privileges of being a \nMember of the Senate is to recommend to the President names of people \nwho should be members of the Federal judiciary--that is either the \nFederal district court, circuit court of appeals, but certainly not the \nU.S. Supreme Court because that is out of the purview of \nrecommendations by a single Senator.\n  Since I have been in the Senate, I have been able to recommend to a \nDemocratic President at least two. We are not a large State so we have \nthe opportunity to only recommend two people to the Federal bench.\n  The first one I was able to recommend was a circuit court of appeals \njudge and the second was a district court judge. This decision was so \nimportant to me that I went out of my way to make sure whoever I \nrecommended to President Clinton at the time would be someone the \nPresident would want to nominate to be confirmed as a member of the \ncircuit court of appeals. In this case it was the Ninth Circuit Court \nof Appeals. Montana is included in the Ninth Circuit.\n  What did I do? First, I went out of my way to put together a group of \nMontanans--6, 7, 8, 10 Montanans--and I selected the best folks I could \nfind in my home State to represent a cross-section, a broad array of \ninterests and points of view. Some were lawyers; some were not lawyers.\n  I said to each one of them: I want you to suggest to me the very best \nthree people in the State of Montana who should serve on the Ninth \nCircuit Court of Appeals. I do not care whether they are Republicans. I \ndo not care whether they are Democrats, liberals, conservatives; I just \nwant the best, the most solid people, the people who have deep common \nsense, have a tremendous sense of history in our country, the highest \nintegrity. I just want the best.\n  The committee I appointed came back to me several weeks, maybe a \nmonth later with three names. I sat down with each of the three for an \ninterview, and I spent about 3 hours with each of the three to try to \ndetermine for myself who was the best person that President Clinton \ncould nominate from Montana to sit on the Ninth Circuit Court of \nAppeals.\n  It was a very difficult process. It was very difficult because the \nthree the group suggested to me were all very good. I made a selection \nfinally. It was Mr. Sid Thomas, who President Clinton appointed and who \nnow sits on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  He has been a tremendous credit to not just the State of Montana and \nthe Ninth Circuit, but the Nation. In fact, many members of the \njudiciary, including the U.S. Supreme Court, talked to me specifically \nabout Judge Thomas and indicated to me they are very proud of him. He \nis a ``solid person,'' a very solid man, a solid judge.\n  The second instance was virtually the same. I put together another \ngroup. There was an opening in the Federal district court in Montana. I \nput together seven, eight, to nine people I thought would do a terrific \njob in coming up with the very best person to sit on the Federal \ndistrict court in Montana.\n  I interviewed each of the three persons the group gave me. I had the \nsame criteria for the committee: I want the best. I do not care if they \nhave brown eyes or blue eyes. I do not care if there is any acid test. \nThat is not relevant to me. I want the very best, most solid, \nthoughtful people with the highest integrity and a deep sense of the \nlaw and history of our State and our Nation.\n  I do not care whether they are Republicans, Democrats, liberals, \nconservatives--that does not mean anything to me. I just want the best.\n  They came up with three names. I interviewed the three people. I, \nagain, had the excruciating choice to make because they were all very \ngood. I made a selection finally, and I recommended to President \nClinton a person who I think has done great credit to the U.S. Federal \ndistrict court in Montana, Judge Don Malloy.\n  I can tell you, the bar in Montana thinks he is terrific. The \nplaintiffs bar, the defense bar--they all have the highest regard for \nhim. Why? Because he is smart, he is hard working, and he does not play \nfavorites. He is what a Federal district court judge should be.\n\n  Why do I say all that? I say that because we are now faced with \nwhether or not the Senate should confirm to the DC Court of Appeals \nMiguel Estrada. Should we or should we not? Let me roll back history a \nbit.\n  Several years ago, I was on the Judiciary Committee. In fact, it was \nquite a few years ago. At that time, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, not \nthen a Justice, was nominated by the President to sit on the U.S. \nSupreme Court. With all deference to Justice O'Connor, that was the \nfirst time, at least in my memory, when a nominee essentially did not \nanswer very many questions.\n  I asked her questions, other members of the committee asked her \nquestions, and she essentially began this tradition of not answering \nthe questions. Again, I have the highest regard for Justice O'Connor. I \nthink she has been a great Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. It \nbothered me as a member of the Judiciary Committee that a nominee was \nnot answering questions. It just did not seem right.\n  We at that time decided, OK, she seems like a very good person. She \nwas in the State senate in her home State of New Mexico, so let's vote \nto confirm her.\n\n[[Page S2392]]\n\n  We are now faced with the situation where Mr. Estrada is not \nanswering any questions whatsoever, and he is not providing other \ninformation to the committee. I am not now on the Judiciary Committee \nbut I take this responsibility of whether or not the Senate should \nconfirm a nominee to the circuit court of appeals, Federal district \ncourt, or the U.S. Supreme Court very seriously. I know all of us in \nthis body do.\n  There are not very many decisions we can make that will be more \nimportant. There are not very many. Why is that? That is because these \nare lifetime appointments.\n  Mr. President, you run for reelection, I do, everybody in this body, \nevery few years, every 6 years. Everybody in the other body runs for \nreelection every 2 years. Every Governor runs every 4 years, sometimes \n2 years. Every President runs every 4 years, except those who cannot \nrun because of the constitutional requirement. We face voters. We are \nheld accountable. Voters have a chance to either reelect us or not. But \nboy, once someone is put in the U.S. Federal judiciary, an article III \nposition, that is for life.\n  I believe that is the way it should be. Why? Because these are the \npeople we want to be totally impartial to do what is right and not be \nswayed by temporary whims and vogues of the moment. We try not to as \nelected officers. It is our job to represent people in our State. If \nthey want something, we should give that to people, given what we think \nmakes sense and is right for our home States and right for the country.\n  Federal judges are held to a different standard. State judges are not \nlifetime appointments. I do not know any who are. Federal judges are \nappointed for life. That is a huge responsibility they have.\n  We have to make sure we get the right people. It is our \nresponsibility. When voters elect us, they basically say: Senator, we \ndo not know all the ins and outs of what goes on in Washington, DC, but \nwe want you to do the right thing. Just do not do something nutty or \ncrazy, but, basically, do the right thing.\n  Most people give us a lot of latitude. So long as it sounds right, \nfits right, and smells right, it really is all right.\n  It does not sound right, it does not fit right, it does not smell \nright, it does not seem right, for this body to confirm somebody who \nwill not answer any questions, who will not give us relevant \ninformation, and who has no prior history so it is hard for us to know.\n  I will bet this: At that Justice Department and perhaps at the White \nHouse, they sat down with Mr. Estrada and asked him a lot of questions. \nI bet he gave them a lot of answers. I bet there is somebody in this \noperation who is supporting his nomination in the executive branch who \nknows a lot about Mr. Estrada, who had long conversations with him. If \nthey did, which is entirely proper--in fact, it is imperative and an \nobligation they have to ask him questions, particularly before the \nPresident suggests a nominee for the DC Court of Appeals. If they do, \nso should we have the information in the Senate. We have an equal \nresponsibility to know how he feels about certain issues.\n  I am not saying he should address how he feels about certain cases \ndecided by the Supreme Court or cases decided by even the court of \nappeals. I am not asking for that because judges have to be impartial. \nI am saying we have a responsibility to know who this fellow is: What \nmakes him tick? What does he really think about? What are his values? \nWhat does he stand for? Will he be impartial? What does he think about \nour Constitution? What does he think about the court as the third \nbranch of Government? There are tons of questions one could come up \nwith, and we have that responsibility.\n  Why do I say we have that responsibility? I have already said it is a \nlifetime appointment, but in addition the Constitution tells us we have \nthat responsibility. The advice and consent provision is in the U.S. \nConstitution.\n  When our Founding Fathers wrote the Constitution, they debated the \nadvice and consent clause. They did not know what it should provide. \nThere are various interpretations, but they knew it was very serious. \nOne interpretation, that is one view, that was advanced very seriously \nwhen our Founding Fathers wrote the Constitution, was this: That the \nSenate should send a selection of three, four, or five names to the \nPresident and then the President makes the decision. The Senate would \ngive the names to the President and then the President would decide. It \nis kind of like what I did a little bit when I was interviewing people \nin Montana. I got a bunch of names of the best people, and I made a \ndecision who I thought was the best person.\n  Why did our Founding Fathers really wrestle over this question over \nwhat the proper mechanism would be for the Senate to jointly decide \nwith the President who should or should not be on the Federal \njudiciary? It is pretty simple. It is our third branch of Government. \nIt is the third of the three branches of Government, and it is not \nright that one branch of Government should dictate who does or who does \nnot sit on the U.S. Supreme Court. That is not right. Rather, it is a \njoint decision. It is a decision which, just as the President took very \nseriously, we have an obligation to take equally seriously.\n\n  It reminds me a little bit of a number of years ago when an earlier \nPresident, President Franklin Roosevelt, decided he did not agree with \nthe Supreme Court decisions. What did he do? He came up with an idea to \nadd more Justices to the U.S. Supreme Court. It is colloquially \nreferred to as court packing by President Roosevelt.\n  The Senate stood up. It said: No, that is the wrong thing to do. I am \nvery proud to say that the Senator who stood up was from Montana. It \nwas Senator Burton Kendall Wheeler. He said: No, it is not the right \nthing to do.\n  Just as he stood up, I think we have an obligation in the Senate to \nstand up when it is the wrong thing to do; that is, to pass judgment \non--to agree with the President's nominee where we have no information, \nwhere he will not answer questions, he will not tell us what he thinks. \nWhat is this person really all about? What is the sense of the man? \nWhere is he? Where is his soul? Who is he? That is what we have to \ndetermine in deciding whether he should be placed on the DC Court of \nAppeals. And I say that very respectfully.\n  I might add that the DC Court of Appeals is no ordinary, garden \nvariety appellate court. It is a special appellate court, and that is \nbecause so many decisions made by Federal agencies go to the DC Court \nof Appeals as opposed to the Ninth Circuit or the Fourth Circuit. There \nare so many of them. There are environmental laws, for example, and \nlabor laws that go primarily to the DC Court of Appeals, for which Mr. \nEstrada has been nominated, much more than to other courts. These \ndecisions affect all of us around the country. They do not just affect \nthe DC Circuit or people who reside in the DC Circuit. They affect all \nAmericans. The DC Court of Appeals jurisdiction extends to the National \nLabor Relations Board, the Occupational Safety and Health \nAdministration, the Federal Communications Commission, the Federal \nElections Commission, the Environmental Protection Agency.\n  Obviously, decisions made by those agencies have a great effect on \nall Americans. When they are reviewed by the DC Court of Appeals, the \ndecisions the DC Court of Appeals makes certainly have the same effect \nupon all Americans. Those rulings affect our workers, our businesses, \nour national environment, our families, and our homes. They affect \npolitical elections. They affect directly the present occupant of the \nchair, just as they affect me directly.\n  About 50 percent of the DC Court's caseload consists of appeals from \nregulations or decisions made by Federal agencies. Fifty percent of the \nDC Court of Appeals caseload is appeals of Federal agencies. In many \ncases, the DC Court of Appeals is the last word, too, on Federal \ndecisions. We all know this.\n  The U.S. Supreme Court is taking fewer cases on appeal. The caseload \nof the U.S. Supreme Court has fallen off dramatically in the last \ncouple or 3 years, which means that the courts of appeals' rulings are \nthat much more important. They are almost like a supreme court in many \nrespects because the U.S. Supreme Court is taking fewer cases.\n  I will give an example of the power of the DC Court of Appeals in my \nState of Montana. This is Montana. Don't forget we are in the Ninth \nCircuit--not\n\n[[Page S2393]]\n\nthe DC Circuit--as is the State of the Presiding Officer. The DC Court \nof Appeals has exclusive jurisdiction over cases brought against the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, particularly regarding the Superfund.\n\n  I know in the Presiding Officer's State there are huge Superfund \nissues. They are dramatic. Superfund is tremendously important to my \nhome State of Montana as well. In the town of Libby, MT, for example, \nthey have suffered from decades of asbestos contamination at the hands \nof W.R. Grace. It is just tragic. It happened to the people of Libby, \nMT. As a result, Superfund cleanup efforts are now taking place in an \nattempt to make the town and its residents whole again. It is a \ngigantic undertaking.\n  Libby is not the only Superfund site. As the Presiding Officer knows, \nwe have Superfund sites around the country. In Montana, for example, we \nhave the largest Superfund site in the Nation. It is called the Clark \nFork Basin. It starts up in Butte and ends up eventually down in the \nState of the Presiding Officer. It is huge. These sites threaten the \nhealth and well-being of so many people not only in my State but in \nother States as well.\n  When Congress created the Superfund, our goal was to ensure that the \npublic health and environment were protected and made whole, \nparticularly the cleanup. So decisions made by the DC Court of Appeals \noverseeing the Environmental Protection Agency obviously greatly \ninfluence whether the intent of the law is actually fulfilled on the \nground; that is, in Montana or any other State in the Nation, because \nEPA is all over America. It is not only the Ninth Circuit where the \nPresiding Officer and I live. There is no question that in the State of \nMontana we have a terrific interest, a big interest, in who sits on the \nDC Circuit Court, given that court's influence over our Nation's \nhealth, safety, and welfare laws.\n  Different Members may disagree with different decisions made by the \nDC Court of Appeals, but we do agree we want a very thoughtful, fully \nconsidered, and impartial decision. That is what we want. That is what \nwe expect. That is why, in my judgment, this body has to go to \nextraordinary lengths to determine whether nominees to the courts of \nappeals, district courts, and the Supreme Court, are the right people. \nIt is our duty.\n\n  We cannot just pass it off and say, oh, the President appointed him. \nWe cannot stop there. It would be irresponsible. When we are elected, \nwe are elected by people in our States to hold up the Constitution of \nthe United States. Certainly the President can appoint, but just as \ncertainly the Senate has the right and, indeed, the obligation to \nadvise and consent and, given the tradition of the advice and consent \nclause and balance of powers, give it the same weight as the President.\n  That is why I think at the bare minimum the Senate has the right to \nask for more information. Who is this man? Find out more about him. \nLook at his writings. What is he hiding? What is there to hide? We all \nknow the more information in the public arena, the more likely it is we \nwill make the right decision. We know that. It is only proper the White \nHouse ask Mr. Estrada to answer some questions and give some \ninformation. This is not rocket science. This is pretty easy. This is \nsimple stuff.\n  I do not feel it is proper for the Senate to confirm Mr. Estrada. \nThis is very important. I cannot think of many decisions we make that \nare ultimately more important, particularly regarding the DC Court of \nAppeals. We may have different conclusions when he gives us \ninformation, but at least he should talk to us.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Baucus pertaining to the submission of S. 396 are \nlocated in today's Record under ``Submission of Concurrent and Senate \nResolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I continue to oppose the Estrada \nnomination. What is at stake in this nomination is a lifetime \nappointment to the second highest court in the land. The D.C. Circuit \nCourt of Appeals makes decisions that affect millions of Americans \nevery day--whether they will drink clean water and breathe clean air--\nwhether workers will be safe in the workplace, and can join unions \nwithout fear of reprisal by their employer--whether minorities and \nwomen will be able to stop workplace harassment.\n  Yet our Republican colleagues want us to rubber stamp the nomination \nof Miguel Estrada to this important court. They say to us, you do not \nneed to look at his record. You do not need to ask him what kind of \njudge he would be. You do not have to ask him to explain the serious \ndiscrepancies in the answers he gave during his hearing in the \nJudiciary Committee. They even make the preposterous and shameless \nclaim that Mr. Estrada is being opposed because he is Latino.\n  Our Republican colleagues obviously do not appreciate the importance \nof the position that Mr. Estrada seeks. If they did, they would not be \nin such a rush to confirm a divisive nominee about whom we know so \nlittle.\n  Our duty under the Constitution is not to rubber stamp. It is to \nprovide informed advice and consent in the nomination process. Our duty \nis to ensure that the Federal judiciary is fair and independent, a \nplace where everyone, even the most vulnerable among us, can obtain \nprotection of their rights. If we become a Senate that simply rubber \nstamps judicial nominees, the nomination process becomes a charade. \nWhoever happens to have the favor of the White House can become a \nFederal judge simply by refusing to give the Senate the information \nnecessary to provide real advice and consent. The Federal courts would \nbecome a political lackey of the executive and legislative branches, \nand would lose their essential independence.\n  We all know the importance of this judicial independence and the \ncritical role that the Federal courts have in the lives of millions of \nour fellow citizens, especially those who are minorities.\n  The Latino experience is typical of minority groups that seek \njustice. When the executive branch has failed them, when the \nlegislative branch has failed them, it is the Federal courts, \nindependent of political forces, that have protected their rights. \nFederal courts have protected Latinos' right to fair redistricting \nrules in Lopez v. Monterey County. Federal courts have also protected \nLatinos' right to bilingual education. They have protected Latinos' \nright to sit on a jury free from challenge on the basis of their race. \nThey protect Latinos' right to be free from racial profiling.\n  When the Senate considers a judicial nominee, it must take this \nhistory into account. We must consider whether the nominee accepts the \nhistoric role of the courts in the protection of basic rights. One of \nthe most serious concerns raised by the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, \nwhich met with Mr. Estrada, was that he does not understand and \nappreciate this history. The Hispanic Caucus does not lightly oppose \nthe nomination of a Latino to a Federal court. In fact, they have never \ndone it before. It would have been far easier for them to decide that a \nLatino judge on the DC Court of Appeals could be called a victory for \nthem. But they realized it would be a victory in name only. They saw \nthat Mr. Estrada would not uphold the basic rights of the Latino \ncommunity, and they decided--unanimously--to oppose his nomination.\n\n  When the Hispanic Caucus reviews a judicial nominee, they look for a \nperson who will have a sense of fairness, who will be sensitive to \nclaims of racial bias and discrimination, and who are aware of the \nfundamental role of the Federal courts in ending these injustices. Mr. \nEstrada failed to satisfy them on each of these important points.\n  The Hispanic Caucus asked Mr. Estrada about his legal work on two \ncases in which he defended anti-loitering ordinances. Statutes such as \nthese have too often been used for racial profiling and to harass \nminorities performing lawful activities. The members of the Hispanic \nCaucus left that meeting convinced that Mr. Estrada did not understand \nthe effect of these anti-loitering statutes on minorities, or that he \ndid not care about them.\n  Mr. Estrada has also demonstrated his lack of sensitivity on issues \naffecting Latinos in his numerous statements about race and affirmative \naction. He has been dismissive of the under-representation of Latinos \namong\n\n[[Page S2394]]\n\nlaw clerks in the Supreme Court. You do not have to be Latino to \nunderstand that there are long-standing barriers to full participation \nby Latinos. But Mr. Estrada does not see it that way. Perhaps this is \nwhy Mr. Estrada has never tried to improve opportunities for Latino \nlawyers or law students.\n  But if you cannot see the problem, you cannot be part of the \nsolution. I am deeply concerned, given these statements by Mr. Estrada, \nthat he would oppose basic programs, that have done so much to open the \ndoors of opportunity for minorities throughout our Nation.\n  In light of all of these facts, the Hispanic Caucus has decided to \noppose this nomination. As I said, they did not make this decision \nlightly. They have supported the nomination of conservative judges in \nthe past, including judges nominated by the current administration. \nJose Martinez, for one, was nominated by this administration. The \nCaucus met with him. Not all of the members of the Caucus agreed with \nMr. Martinez's politics, but they saw that Mr. Martinez was sensitive \nto the needs and experience of the Latino community. He understood the \nhistoric and important role of the Federal courts in the lives of \nLatinos. So the caucus supported his nomination and Judge Martinez is \nnow a United States District Judge for the Southern District of \nFlorida.\n  When Democrats oppose Mr. Estrada, we are standing with these groups. \nWe are standing up for the rights of Latinos and other minorities. In \nfact, it has been Senate Republicans who have unfairly blocked the \nconfirmation of Latino nominees. The last Republican-controlled Senate \nunfairly refused to confirm eight--eight--qualified Latino nominees. \nTwo who were nominated to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals from Texas \nwere not even given hearings by the Republicans.\n  The Fifth Circuit is one of the areas where the highest percentage of \nminorities in this country live. Where were our Republican colleagues \nwhen these qualified judges were waiting for confirmation? Where were \nour Republican colleagues when Richard Paez waited for confirmation \nlonger than any other nominee in U.S. history? Where were they? They \nwere in control of the Senate.\n  When Republicans call on us to rubberstamp a judicial nominee, \ntelling us that we have no right to look into his record to see what \nkind of judge he may be, they are ignoring their own history, and they \nare ignoring the proper role of the Senate. President Bush, more than \nperhaps any other President, has made it his goal to pack the courts \nwith judges who will roll back basic Federal rights, including civil \nrights, workers' rights, and environmental protections. Ideology \nclearly guides the President's decision to nominate judges. It clearly \nguided the decision to nominate Mr. Estrada. It would be wrong to ask \nSenators now to ignore his ideology. Judges should be committed to \nbasic principles and ideals. They should respect our judicial system \nand the co-equal relationship between the executive, legislative, and \njudicial branches. It makes no sense for the Senate, in fulfilling its \nconstitutional role, to adopt a head-in-the-sand approach and abandon \nall ideological considerations in deciding whether to confirm Mr. \nEstrada.\n  Now we have, instead, a Republican stampede to confirm a nominee we \nknow very little about. Despite the critical importance of the Federal \ncourts, and despite the immense power of the appellate court to which \nhe has been appointed, Miguel Estrada has not answered the questions \nput to him. He has not been forthcoming about the views that he would \nbring to the bench. He has failed to resolve the serious discrepancies \nin his answers to the questions put to him during his hearing. The Bush \nadministration refuses to turn over important documents to the Senate \nas we consider this nominee, despite clear precedent for doing so.\n  At the same time, what we do know about him clearly indicates that he \nfails to appreciate the role of the Federal courts and Federal rights \nin the protection of the most vulnerable members of our society. On \nthis inadequate and unsatisfactory record, the Senate should not \nconfirm a nominee to such an important position.\n\n\n                                  iraq\n\n  Mr. President, tomorrow, the United Nations inspectors will report to \nthe Security Council about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. In all \nlikelihood we will continue to hear from Mr. Hans Blix that the \ninspections are proceeding, but that Iraqi authorities need to be much \nmore cooperative. We know that the administration is lobbying Mr. Blix \nto submit the strongest possible case that Iraq is not cooperating.\n  We all agree that Saddam Hussein is a dangerous and deceptive \ndictator. We live in a dangerous world and Saddam must be disarmed. The \nquestion is how to do it in a way that minimizes the risks to the \nAmerican people at home, to our armed forces, and to our allies.\n  I am still hopeful that we can avoid war. War should always be a last \nresort.\n  Earlier today, President Bush quoted President Kennedy and referred \nto the Cuban missile crisis. President Bush praised my brother for \nunderstanding that the dangers to freedom had to be confronted early \nand decisively.\n  President Kennedy did understand this. But he also genuinely believed \nthat war must always be the last resort. When Soviet missiles were \ndiscovered in Cuba--missiles far more threatening to us than anything \nSaddam has today--some leaders in the highest councils of our \ngovernment urged an immediate and unilateral strike. Instead, the \nUnited States took its case to the United Nations, won the endorsement \nof the Organization of American States, and persuaded even our most \nskeptical allies. We imposed a blockade, demanded inspection, and \ninsisted on the removal of the missiles--all without resorting to full-\nscale war.\n  As he said then:\n\n       Action is required . . . and these actions [now] may only \n     be the beginning. We will not prematurely or unnecessarily \n     risk the costs of .  .  . war--but neither will we shrink \n     from that risk at any time it must be faced.\n\n  I continue to be concerned that the Bush administration is persisting \nin its rush to war with Iraq, even as we face grave threats from al-\nQaida terrorism and North Korea's nuclear ambitions. The administration \nhas done far too little to tell Congress and the American people about \nwhat our country and our troops will face in going to war with Iraq, \nespecially if we have little genuine support from our allies.\n  We are nearing decision time. I urge President Bush to come clean \nwith the American people about this war. Before endangering the \nNation's sons and daughters in the Iraqi desert, our citizens deserve \nfull answers to four questions.\n  First, the President must explain what he considers victory in Iraq. \nThe American people deserve at least this much. Is it disarmament? Is \nit the overthrow of Saddam? Is it the establishment of a stable, \ndemocratic government? If we get rid of Saddam, but leave his \nbureaucracy in power, will that be a victory? Or, as General Zinni has \nsaid, will we be doing what we did in Afghanistan--drive the old Soviet \nUnion out and let something arguably worse emerge?\n  This should be a basic consideration in committing American lives to \nthis war. Our country should know what we are fighting for. But the \nadministration has failed to define even this most basic question for \nthe American people.\n  Second, the President must explain whether we are doing all we can to \nsee that America will be secure at home. A war in Iraq may well \nstrengthen al-Qaida terrorists, not weaken them, especially if the \nMuslim world opposes us. We have not broken Osama bin Ladin's will to \nkill Americans. Our Nation has just gone on new and higher alert \nbecause of the increased overall threat from al-Qaida. What if al-Qaida \ndecides to time its next attack for the day we go to war? The war \nagainst al-Qaida must remain our top priority.\n  In fact, our Nation's intelligence experts have maintained \nconsistently since 9/11 that al-Qaida terrorism is the greatest threat \nto our security here at home. They also fear that an American attack on \nIraq will only make matters worse by inflaming anti-American sentiments \nacross the Arab world.\n  Third, the President must fully explain how long, even after the war \nends, we will have to commit our forces and economic resources to deal \nwith the consequences of the war. This war will be different than the \nGulf war. We will not stop short of Baghdad. If we want to change the \nregime, we may well have to fight in Baghdad and engage in hand-to-hand \ncombat and\n\n[[Page S2395]]\n\nurban guerilla warfare. When the war is over, our troops will become an \noccupying force, possibly for many years. The tribal, ethnic, and \nreligious fault lines that Saddam has held together through repression \nmay fall apart--much as they did in the brutal civil wars in the former \nYugoslavia, in Rwanda, and other countries.\n  Will the United States have to manage Iraq for years to come on our \nown? Are we prepared to commit billions of American dollars to Iraq for \nyears to come? Will our troops be part of a United Nations force? Will \nthey become sitting targets for terrorists?\n  Finally, the President must explain whether our Nation is prepared to \nuse this war as the new foreign and defense policy for the future. Are \nwe prepared to invade any nation that poses a threat?\n  Iran, Libya--forget Libya. Pan Am 103; 67 American servicemen who \nwere killed; 13 families in the State of Massachusetts; scores of \nfamilies in New Jersey and other States--a country that has used \nchemical warfare against its neighbors and against Chad in the south.\n  Libya, Iran, with all of the harboring of terrorists and Hamas--the \nterrorists that are so active in Syria, and these other countries. What \nare we going to do about these nations as they continue to move forward \nin developing weapons of mass destruction? What are our policies going \nto be about them? Which country will be next? Will we attack them, too?\n  Are we really prepared, as the administration is considering, to \nradically change our nuclear weapons policy and use nuclear weapons in \nIraq and other conflicts? Even contemplating the first use of nuclear \nweapons in Iraq under current circumstances and against a non-nuclear \nnation dangerously undermines the crucial and historical distinction \nbetween conventional and nuclear arms. It undermines our international \ncommitment to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty that we will not \nconsider a first strike against a country that is a nonnuclear country. \nIf we use the Nation's nuclear arsenal in this unprecedented way in \nIraq, it will be the most fateful decision since the nuclear attack on \nHiroshima. All of us are hopeful we will not use the tactical nukes. We \nhave abundant testimony that our conventional weapons are quite capable \nand able to handle any of the challenges we are going to face in terms \nof deep bunkers and other activities. But we have to listen to those in \nthe administration who are talking in a different way about the \ndevelopment of a tactical nuke, and also about perhaps changing what \nthey consider to be the STRAPP amendment that limits the research to 5 \nkilotons and the administration's consideration of that.\n\n  Obviously, implications of any use of any nuclear war in Iraq would \ninflame the people not only of that nation but certainly of Arabs all \nover the world--and not only the Arabs and the move towards developing \nsmaller, more easily usable nuclear weapons and all of the challenges \nwe would have of being more attractive to use under certain \ncircumstances with the dangers of proliferation and the fact these \nweapons could be proliferated and stolen and used and captured by \nterrorists.\n  On each of these questions, the President must reassure the American \npeople. They deserve to know that we are not stepping into quicksand \nand that this military operation is well thought out. He must convince \nthe Nation that we are putting as much effort into thinking about how \nwe get out of Iraq as we are about getting into Iraq.\n  We must take both the short-term and the long-term view of this \nenormous problem. Whether war with Iraq will be a sprint or a marathon \nwe must always remember the finish line.\n  There is no more important decision by Congress or the President \nunder the Constitution than the decision to send our men and women in \nuniform to war. The administration must make a compelling case that war \nwith Iraq is now the only alternative and explain it to the American \npeople\n  The administration says we can fight a war in Iraq without \nundermining our most pressing national security priority--the ongoing \nwar against the international al-Qaida terrorist network.\n  al-Qaida--not Iraq--is the most imminent threat to our national \nsecurity. Our citizens are asked to protect themselves from Osama bin \nLadin at home with a roll of duct tape, while the administration sends \nthe most deadly and sophisticated army in the world to go to war with \nSaddam Hussein. Those are the wrong priorities.\n  On Monday, Tom Ridge, the Secretary of Homeland Security said that \nthe heightened security warning that has millions of Americans stocking \nup on food, water, duct tape, and plastic sheeting is connected to al-\nQaida and not ``the possibility of military involvement with Iraq.''\n  On Tuesday, FBI Director Mueller told the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee that ``the Al Qaeda network will remain for the foreseeable \nfuture the most immediate and serious threat facing this country.''\n  On Wednesday, CIA Director Tenet told the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee that the heightened alert issued this week is because of the \nthreat from al-Qaida--not Iraq.\n  For any Member of this body who thinks we have done what we need to \ndo in homeland security, call any mayor in your State, call any mayor \nin a major city or a small city in your State, and ask them whether \nthey have received the support for the training of first responders. \nAsk them if they have the various vaccines, how that program is going--\nand it isn't going, because we have failed to develop a compensation \nfund for that and to match our determination for vaccines with the \nother kinds of supportive efforts in terms of health care.\n  Ask any mayor in any sized city what degree of support they are \ngetting and whether they believe they are receiving the kind of \nassistance they need--whether it is in the radios, in the \ncommunications, whether it is in the training, whether it is in the \nwide area of support for public health interests--and you will get the \nanswer that all of us heard--that I heard--within the last 10 days when \nthe mayors across this country came together and met here. And the \nanswer is clearly: No, no, no, it is not there.\n  In addition to threatening American lives, Saudi Arabia has indicated \nit will ask American troops to leave its soil. NATO's division over war \nhas threatened the alliance. The Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan \nGreenspan, has said uncertainty over Iraq is slowing our Nation's \neconomy.\n  There you have three activities: Osama bin Laden, wherever he is, \nAmerican troops out of Saudi Arabia, division in the alliance, \nstagnation here at home in the economy. And we are all blaming Osama \nbin Laden. We are about to send our troops on into Iraq, not giving \ninspections a chance to finish. The wrong priorities, Mr. President.\n  As I mentioned in terms of what we are doing here at home, I am \nconcerned about the state of our preparedness. Clearly, there is much \nmore we need to do at the Federal, State, and local levels to \nstrengthen our defenses against a terrorist attack.\n  First responders are not adequately prepared for a chemical or \nbiological attack. The radios are not interoperable, and they lack the \ntraining and gear to protect them in the event of an emergency. Ask any \nof your mayors, as I mentioned, across the country. You will get your \nanswer.\n  This isn't just a Democrat pointing this out. Last week, our former \ncolleague, Senator Rudman, of the State of New Hampshire, said:\n\n       There was no rational answer for the White House failure to \n     seek more funds for the domestic security in the 2004 budget. \n     I'm very concerned. We have to put more money into the Coast \n     Guard, into communications gear, into preparedness for the \n     use of weapons of mass destruction, into police and \n     firefighters. We have to spend a huge additional amount of \n     money on port security. Money isn't the only answer, but it \n     is a pretty clear indication of a nation's priorities in this \n     area, and it has not been there in terms of the support on \n     homeland security.\n\n  Even before the war has begun, we hear of possible threats from a \nwave of suicide bombers. War with Iraq could swell the ranks of \nterrorists and trigger an escalation in terrorist acts. As Gen Wesley \nClark told the Armed Services Committee last September, war with Iraq \ncould ``super-charge recruiting for Al Qaeda.''\n  These are real dangers--dangers that the administration has minimized \nin its determination to attack Iraq.\n  The administration maintains there are convincing links between al-\nQaida\n\n[[Page S2396]]\n\nand Iraq that justify war. But al-Qaida activists are present in more \nthan 60 countries, including Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and also in \nthe United States. Even in the administration, there are skeptics about \nthe links with Iraq. Intelligence analysts are concerned that \nintelligence is being politicized to justify war, as the New York Times \npointed out in a recent article which I will ask to be printed in the \nRecord.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that article be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          Split at C.I.A. and F.B.I. on Iraqi Ties to Al Qaeda\n\n                  (By James Risen and David Johnston)\n\n       Washington, Feb. 1--The Bush administration's efforts to \n     build a case for war against Iraq using intelligence to link \n     it to Al Qaeda and the development of prohibited weapons has \n     created friction within United States intelligence agencies, \n     government officials said.\n       Some analysts at the Central Intelligence Agency have \n     complained that senior administration officials have \n     exaggerated the significance of some intelligence reports \n     about Iraq, particularly about its possible links to \n     terrorism, in order to strengthen their political argument \n     for war, government officials said.\n       At the Federal Bureau of Investigation, some investigators \n     said they were baffled by the Bush administration's \n     insistence on a solid link between Iraq and Osama bin Laden's \n     network. We've been looking at this hard for more than a year \n     and you know what, we just don't think it's there,'' a \n     government official said.\n       The tension within the intelligence agencies comes as \n     Secretary of State Colin L. Powell is poised to go before the \n     United Nations Security Council on Wednesday to present \n     evidence of Iraq's links to terrorism and its continuing \n     efforts to develop chemical, biological and nuclear weapons \n     and long-range missiles.\n       Interviews with administration officials revealed divisions \n     between, on one side, the Pentagon and the National Security \n     Council, which has become a clearinghouse for the evidence \n     being prepared for Mr. Powell, and, on the other, the C.I.A. \n     and, to some degree, the State Department and agencies like \n     the F.B.I.\n       In the interviews, two officials, Paul D. Wolfowitz, deputy \n     defense secretary, and Stephen J. Hadley, deputy national \n     security adviser, were cited as being most eager to interpret \n     evidence deemed murky by intelligence officials to show a \n     clearer picture of Iraq's involvement in illicit weapons \n     programs and terrorism. Their bosses, Defense Secretary \n     Donald H. Rumsfeld and the national security adviser, \n     Condoleezza Rice, have also pressed a hard line, officials \n     said.\n       A senior administration official said discussions in \n     preparation for Mr. Powell's presentation were intense, but \n     not rancorous, and said there was little dissension among \n     President Bush's top advisers about the fundamental nature of \n     President Saddam Hussein's government. ``I haven't detected \n     anyone who thinks this a not compelling case,'' the official \n     said.\n       Mr. Bush asserted in his State of the Union address this \n     week that Iraq was protecting and aiding Qaeda operatives, \n     but American intelligence and law enforcement officials said \n     the evidence was fragmentary and inconclusive.\n       ``It's more than just skepticism,'' said one official, \n     describing the feelings of some analysts in the intelligence \n     agencies. ``I think there is also a sense of disappointment \n     with the community's leadership that they are not standing up \n     for them at a time when the intelligence is obviously being \n     politicized.''\n       Neither George J. Tenet, the director of central \n     intelligence, nor the F.B.I. director, Robert S. Mueller III, \n     have publicly engaged in the debate about the evidence on \n     Iraq in recent weeks, even as the Bush administration has \n     intensified its efforts to build the case for a possible \n     war.\n       The last time Mr. Tenet found himself at the center of the \n     public debate over intelligence concerning Iraq was in \n     October, when the Senate declassified a brief letter Mr. \n     Tenet wrote describing some of the C.I.A.'s assessments about \n     Iraq.\n       His letter stated that the C.I.A. believed that Iraq had, \n     for the time being, probably decided not to conduct terrorist \n     attacks with conventional or chemical or biological weapons \n     against the United States, but the letter added that Mr. \n     Hussein might resort to terrorism if he believed that an \n     American-led attack was about to begin.\n       Alliances within the group of officials involved have \n     strengthened the argument that Mr. Bush should take a firm \n     view of the evidence. ``Wolfowitz and Hadley are very \n     compatible,'' said one administration official. ``They have a \n     very good working relationship.''\n       There were some signs that Mr. Powell might not present the \n     administration's most aggressive case against Iraq when he \n     speaks to the United Nations, leaving such a final definitive \n     statement to the president in some future address.\n       ``You won't see Powell swing for the fences,'' the official \n     said. ``It will not be the end-all speech. The president will \n     do that. The president has to lay it out in a more detailed \n     way.''\n       Deputy Secretary of State Richard L. Armitage told the \n     Senate Foreign Relations Committee last Thursday that Mr. \n     Powell would not assert a direct link between the Iraqi \n     government and the September 11 attacks on New York and \n     Washington.\n       In demonstrating that there are links between Iraq and Al \n     Qaeda, Mr. Powell is expected to focus on intelligence about \n     possible connections between Mr. Hussein, an Islamic militant \n     group that may have produced poisons in a remote region of \n     northern Iraq and a Qaeda terrorist leader, Abu Mussab al-\n     Zarqawi. Much of the intelligence had been publicly known for \n     months.\n       Some of the most recent intelligence related to Mr. Zarqawi \n     centers on charges that he orchestrated the plot on Oct. 28 \n     in Amman, Jordan, in which two Qaeda followers--under Mr. \n     Zarqawi's direction--stalked and shot to death Laurence \n     Foley, an American diplomat.\n       In December, the Jordanian authorities announced that the \n     two men had confessed to killing Mr. Foley and that they had \n     been directed by Mr. Zarqawi.\n       The connection to the Foley killing was important because \n     the United States had evidence that Mr. Zarqawi, a Jordanian \n     of Palestinian descent, has spent time in Baghdad earlier in \n     2002. American officials describe Mr. Zarqawi as a major \n     figure in Al Qaeda's leadership and say that after he was \n     wounded in the fighting in Afghanistan after September 11, he \n     made his way to Iraq in the spring of 2002.\n       He was hospitalized in Baghdad for treatment of his wounds, \n     and then disappeared in August, after Jordanian officials \n     told the Iraqi government they knew he was there. There have \n     been recent reports that he is in hiding in northern Iraq, \n     but that has not yet been confirmed.\n       But despite Mr. Zarqaqi's earlier presence in Baghdad, \n     American officials have no evidence linking Iraqi officials \n     to Mr. Foley's killing, or direct evidence that Mr. Zarqawi \n     is working with the Iraqi government.\n       ``All they know is that he was in the hospital there,'' one \n     official said.\n       If he is in northern Iraq, American officials believe that \n     Mr. Zarqawi may be with members of a militant group there \n     called Ansar al-Islam. There is evidence that he has links to \n     the group, and that he may have been working with it to \n     develop poisons for use in terrorist attacks, possibly \n     including a recent plot to poison the food supply of British \n     troops.\n       But intelligence officials say there is disagreement among \n     analysts about whether there are significant connections \n     between Ansar al-Islam and the Baghdad government. Some \n     administration officials, particularly at the Pentagon, have \n     argued that Ansar al-Islam has close ties to the Iraqi \n     government, but other intelligence officials say there is \n     only fragmentary evidence of such a link.\n       Intelligence professionals have expressed fewer \n     reservations about the administration's statements concerning \n     Iraq's weapons programs. There is broad agreement within \n     intelligence agencies that Iraq has continued its efforts to \n     develop chemical, biological, and probably nuclear weapons, \n     and that it is still trying to hide its weapons programs from \n     United Nations inspectors.\n       Officials said the United States had obtained \n     communications intercepts that show Iraqi officials coaching \n     scientists in how to avoid providing valuable information \n     about Iraq's weapons programs to inspectors. At the United \n     Nations, Mr. Powell may also display American satellite \n     photographs showing Iraqi officials moving equipment and \n     materials out of buildings before they can be inspected by \n     the United Nations.\n       Still, there have been disagreements over specific pieces \n     of intelligence used publicly by the White House to make its \n     case, including the significance of one report that Iraq had \n     imported special aluminum tubes for use in its nuclear \n     weapons program.\n       In testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee \n     on Thursday, Mr. Armitage acknowledged that the \n     administration had at times relied on inconclusive reports \n     that had not served to strengthen Washington's case.\n       He agreed with the suggestion of Senator Joseph R. Biden \n     Jr. of Delaware, the committee's ranking Democrat, that the \n     administration should instead stick with the indisputable \n     evidence that Iraq has in the past stockpiled chemical \n     weapons, tried to make biological weapons, and has continued \n     to deceive United Nations inspectors.\n       ``As we used to say in the Navy, KISS, `Keep it simple, \n     sailor,' '' Mr Armitage said. ``Go with your strong points.''\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Although the U.N. inspectors have found no evidence so \nfar of a revived nuclear weapons program in Iraq, there is ample \nevidence in North Korea. North Korea possesses 8,000 spent nuclear fuel \nrods capable of being reprocessed, by May, into enough plutonium to \nmake up to 6 nuclear bombs. With inspectors gone and North Korea gone \nfrom the Non-Proliferation Treaty, we face an urgent crisis, with \nnothing to prevent that nation from quickly producing a significant \namount of nuclear materials and nuclear weapons for its own use, or for \nterrorists hostile to America and our allies.\n  North Korea has already provided missiles to deliver chemical, \nbiological, and nuclear weapons to terrorist\n\n[[Page S2397]]\n\nstates, including Iran, Syria, and Libya. We understand that. North \nKorea has already provided the missiles to deliver chemical, \nbiological, and nuclear weapons to terrorist states. Desperate and \nstrapped for cash, North Korea can easily provide nuclear weapons or \nweapons grade plutonium to terrorist groups, which could be used \nagainst us in the very near future. And we are talking about the \nproduction of weapons grade plutonium in the next few weeks. There is \nno division of opinion on that, absolutely none. There is no division \nof opinion on that. As some have described it, it would be a cash cow \nfor North Korea that is absolutely strapped for cash.\n  Despite these alarm bells, the administration refuses to call the \nsituation on the Korean peninsula what it is: a genuine crisis. If this \nis not a crisis, I don't know what is.\n  The administration refuses to directly engage the North Koreans in \ntalks to persuade North Korea to end its nuclear program. By ignoring \nthe North Korean crisis in order to keep focus on Iraq, the \nadministration has kept its eye on the wrong place.\n  The administration says we can handle the war in Iraq, we can handle \nthe war against al-Qaida, and we can deal with the problems of the \nnuclear crisis in North Korea. Any administration should seek to avoid \nthree simultaneous foreign policy crises. In this case, we can, and we \nshould, by not rushing to war with Iraq.\n  It is far from clear that we will be safer by attacking Iraq. In an \nOctober 7, 2000, letter to the Senate Committee on Intelligence, CIA \nDirector George Tenet said the probability of Saddam Hussein initiating \nan attack on the United States was low. But his letter said: ``should \nSaddam Hussein conclude that a U.S.-led attack could no longer be \ndeterred, he probably would become much less constrained in adopting \nterrorist actions.''\n  Yesterday, Admiral Jacoby, the Director of the Defense Intelligence \nAgency, told the Senate Armed Services Committee that Saddam Hussein \nwould use weapons of mass destruction ``when he makes the decision that \n[his] regime is in jeopardy.'' CIA Director Tenet agreed with this \nassessment.\n  This assessment begs the question: If Saddam will not use weapons of \nmass destruction against the United States until his regime is about to \nfall, why is it in our national security interest to provoke him into \nusing them?\n  The administration must be more forthcoming about the potential human \ncosts of war with Iraq, especially if it pushes Saddam into unleashing \nwhatever weapons of mass destruction he possesses. The administration \nhas released no casualty estimates, and they could be extremely high. \nMany military experts have predicted urban guerilla warfare--a scenario \nwhich Retired General Joseph Hoar, who had responsibility for Iraq \nbefore the gulf war, says could look ``like the last 15 minutes of \n`Saving Private Ryan.' ''\n  Nor has the administration fully explained the ramifications of \nlarge-scale mobilization of the National Guard and Reserve--especially \nits effect on police, firefighters, and others, who will be on duty for \nIraq but who are needed on the front lines here at home if there is a \nterrorist attack on the homeland. In Massachusetts, 2,000 citizens have \nbeen called to active duty in the Armed Forces. Many of them are \npolice, firefighters, first responders, and other health workers.\n  Nor has the administration been candid about the humanitarian crisis \nthat could result from war.\n  Refugee organizations are desperately trying to prepare for a flood \nof as many as 900,000 refugees. Billions of dollars and years of \ncommitment may well be needed to achieve a peaceful post-war Iraq, but \nthe American people still do not know how that process will unfold and \nwho will pay for it.\n  No war can be successfully waged if it lacks the strong support of \nthe American people. Before pulling the trigger on war, the \nAdministration must tell the American people the full story about Iraq. \nSo far, it has not.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nsupport of the nomination of Miguel Estrada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I recognize that we are now in our \nninth day of debate leading up to an ultimate vote on whether or not \nMiguel Estrada should be confirmed as the nominee of President George \nW. Bush to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. \nAs part of the debate on both sides of the aisle, there has been a \ncontinual question asked on this side of our friends by the other side \nwho are in opposition to the appointment and confirmation of Mr. \nEstrada. That question has been: Give us a reason we should not have a \nvote on whether or not Mr. Estrada should be confirmed.\n  I have great respect for the Senator from Massachusetts. He has \ncertainly been a part of this institution for a long time. I listened \nvery closely to his comments which I respect. And I respect his opinion \nand his right to hold his opinion in opposition to Mr. Estrada. But I \nthink what we have just heard for the last 20 minutes is very \nindicative of what we have heard for the last 9 days. And that is, \nthere is no reason Mr. Estrada should not be confirmed.\n  There have been reasons put forth from the other side, and every time \none of those reasons has been put forth, the chairman of our committee, \nSenator Hatch, or someone else, has risen to refute that argument. What \nthe other side has now done is, instead of concentrating on the \nargument in opposition to Mr. Estrada, they have gotten off extensively \non to other issues.\n  I go back to the same question we have asked: Why do we not vote on \nMr. Estrada? What is the reason you have that Mr. Estrada should not be \nconfirmed as President Bush's nominee to the Circuit Court for the \nDistrict of Columbia?\n  There has been a lot of debate about what was said and the opinion \nthat came out of the conversation between Mr. Estrada and the Hispanic \nCaucus over on the House side. Let me tell you about some of the folks \nin the Hispanic community who have come out in support of the \nnomination of Mr. Estrada: The League of United Latin American \nCitizens, which is the Nation's oldest and largest Hispanic civil \nrights organization, has come out in support of the nomination and \nconfirmation of Mr. Estrada; the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce; the \nHispanic National Bar Association; the Hispanic Business Roundtable; \nthe Latino Coalition; the National Association of Small Disadvantaged \nBusinesses; the Mexican American Grocers Association; the Phoenix \nConstruction Services; the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce of Greater \nKansas City; the Hispanic Engineers Business Corporation; the Hispano \nChamber of Commerce de Las Cruces; Casa Del Sinaloense; the Republican \nNational Hispanic Assembly; Hispanic Contractors of America, Inc., and \nCharo Community Development Corporation--a long and distinguished list \nof Hispanic entities that have come out in strong support of the \nnomination and confirmation of Miguel Estrada.\n  Let me go further and quote from statements from some individuals who \nare involved in some of these organizations. The League of United Latin \nAmerican Citizens, the oldest and largest Hispanic civil rights \norganization--the president of that organization is a gentleman named \nDovalina. Here is what he says about Miguel Estrada:\n\n       On behalf of the League of United Latin American Citizens, \n     the nation's oldest and largest Hispanic civil rights \n     organization, I write to express our strong support for the \n     confirmation of Miguel Estrada. . . .Few Hispanic attorneys \n     have as strong educational credentials as Mr. Estrada, who \n     graduated magna cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa from Columbia \n     and magna cum laude from Harvard Law School, where he was \n     editor of the Harvard Law Review. He also served as a law \n     clerk to the Honorable Anthony M. Kennedy in the United \n     States Supreme Court, making him one of a handful of \n     Hispanic attorneys to have had this opportunity. He is \n     truly one of the rising stars in the Hispanic community \n     and a role model for our youth.\n\n  The Latino Coalition, of which the president is, Mr. Robert \nDeposada--here is what he said about Mr. Estrada:\n\n       To deny Latino's, the nation's largest minority, the \n     opportunity to have one of our own serve on this court in our \n     nation's capital is unforgivable.\n\n  The president of the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, Ms. \nElizabeth Lisboa-Farrow, stated:\n\n\n[[Page S2398]]\n\n\n       We unanimously endorse this nominee and strongly urge you \n     to move on the confirmation of Miguel Estrada. As a judge, he \n     will be a credit to the federal judiciary, the President, \n     Hispanics, and all Americans.\n\n  That emphasizes something I said on the floor a few days ago. There \nhas been a lot of debate about Mr. Estrada being a Latino. Mr. Estrada \nis a Latino. I am sure he is very proud of that. But the thing I like \nabout Mr. Estrada is that he is qualified to be appointed to the \nCircuit Court for the DC Circuit. He is qualified because he is an \nintellectual. He is bright. His record proves that. He is a world class \nlawyer who happens to be a Latino. This man needs to be appointed and \nconfirmed to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals because he is a good \nlawyer. Even more than that, he is an outstanding lawyer.\n  The president of the Hispanic National Bar Association, Mr. Rafael \nSantiago, stated as follows:\n\n       The Hispanic National Bar Association, national voice of \n     over 25,000 Hispanic lawyers in the United States, issues its \n     endorsement.  . . .Mr. Estrada's confirmation will break new \n     ground for Hispanics in the judiciary. The time has come to \n     move on Mr. Estrada's nomination. I urge the Senate Committee \n     on the Judiciary to schedule a hearing on Mr. Estrada's \n     nomination and the U.S. Senate to bring this highly qualified \n     nominee to a vote.\n\n  Mr. Henry T. Wilfong, Jr., president of the National Association of \nSmall Disadvantaged Businesses, stated as follows, in a letter to \nSenator Leahy on July 12, 2001:\n\n       The [National Association of Small Disadvantaged \n     Businesses] would like to add our support . . . for Miguel \n     Estrada's nomination as United States Court of Appeals Judge \n     for the District of Columbia Circuit.\n       Mr. Estrada is a brilliantly talented and accomplished \n     attorney who will make an outstanding addition to the \n     prestigious DC Circuit. . . .While we do not dwell on \n     symbolism, we feel that Mr. Estrada's appointment as the \n     first Hispanic member of the DC Circuit will be of benefit to \n     us in further illustrating the wide range of talent in the \n     minority communities, just wanting to be effectively and \n     fully used.\n\n  Well, I could go on quoting comments from other members of the \nHispanic organizations around the country. All of the major Hispanic \norganizations have said this man needs to be confirmed to the DC \nCircuit Court of Appeals. He needs to be confirmed, yes, because we are \nproud of him as a Latino, but he needs to be confirmed because he is \none of America's outstanding lawyers.\n  Now, some of the criticism that has been directed at Mr. Estrada has \nbeen for totally unfounded reasons. I wish to talk about a couple of \nthose. I wasn't here back in September of 2002, when the hearing of Mr. \nEstrada was held before the Senate Judiciary Committee. But at that \npoint in time, the Judiciary Committee was controlled by the Democrats. \nThe chairman of that committee was Senator Leahy, who I have come to \nknow. He is a very fair man. He is a very strong advocate for his \nbeliefs. But I have seen him operate within the Judiciary Committee, \nand I know him to be a person who is very deliberate in the way he \npresents himself on that committee. So I have no doubt that at the time \nof Mr. Estrada's hearing in September of last year, Mr. Estrada was \ntreated very fairly and was given due accord.\n  One of the criticisms that has been repeated today is the fact Mr. \nEstrada, during the course of that hearing, in September of last year, \nwas that he was nonresponsive to questions that were presented. Under \nthe leadership of Senator Leahy, the hearing began at around 10 o'clock \nin the morning. I am told it lasted until 5:30 in the evening; and \nalthough there were few district court nominees who were also \ntestifying at that hearing, the great bulk of the time was given to Mr. \nEstrada. That is the case, as I have seen it, over the last several \nweeks since I was elected and sworn in as a Member of this body and \nappointed to the Judiciary Committee.\n  After the hearing, every member of the Judiciary Committee was given \nan opportunity not just to ask every question they wanted to ask, but \nif they weren't satisfied with the answers they received, whether it \nwas what they wanted to hear or not, they had the opportunity to ask \nthat Mr. Estrada come back for another series of questions. But they \ndid not do so. He was not asked to come back and appear before the \nJudiciary Committee again.\n  In addition to that, at every hearing we have on judicial nominees--\nand I know this to have been the case last year under the direction of \nSenator Leahy--every member of the Judiciary Committee has the \nopportunity to submit written questions to every nominee who has their \nconfirmation hearing before the Judiciary Committee. So if there was \nany member of that committee who was not satisfied with the answers \nthey received, or wanted a written answer in addition to the verbal \nanswer that was given that day, or if they didn't feel as if the \nnominee was being totally forthcoming, they could ask the question \nagain and get an answer in writing.\n  After the hearing of Mr. Estrada before the Judiciary Committee, only \ntwo Democratic Senators submitted written questions. Some of those \nfolks who are on the other side of the aisle, over the last 9 days who \nhave been complaining the loudest about not knowing enough about Mr. \nEstrada, did not submit any written questions at all. Is that fair? Is \nthat reasonable? Is that the way this body ought to function with \nrespect to the confirmation of our judicial nominees? I don't think so. \nI don't think that is the way our Founding Fathers intended this body \nto operate.\n\n  Let me look at another couple of objections that have been raised by \nthe other side with respect to Mr. Estrada. There has been an issue \nregarding the fact that he has no judicial experience and, therefore, \nhe should not be confirmed.\n  Well, let me say that if that were the case, if experience in an area \nin our line of work, politics, was a requirement to be elected, I never \nwould have been elected to the House of Representatives where I gained \nexperience before I was elected to the Senate. I had never run for \npolitical office before. You know what? I brought a lot of assets to \nthe House of Representatives because I was not involved in politics \nbefore. I had about 72 other Republican classmates in my class in 1994. \nSome of them had been involved in politics. The one common thread we \nall had was that we came from a business background. Most of us have \nhad to meet a payroll, and we knew and understood about business and \nabout balancing budgets. And one of the focuses of the class of 1994 in \nthe House of Representatives was to move forward to balance the budget \nof this country, which had not been balanced for decades prior to that \nelection. We achieved that. We achieved it because we knew and \nunderstood that is what was required of families in America who sit \naround their kitchen table every single month, and it was only right to \nask Congress to do that. That is the kind of lack of political \nexperience that my class had when we were elected in 1994.\n  For the contention to be made that Mr. Estrada has no judicial \nexperience and that is why he ought not to be confirmed, I think is \njust ludicrous. I think because he lacks judicial experience, that may \nbe an asset. There have been some pretty significant judges appointed \nto the bench who did not have judicial experience. Byron White, \nnominated by President Kennedy, and William Rehnquist, currently Chief \nJustice of the U.S. Supreme Court, had no judicial experience when they \nwere appointed to the court. Of the eight judges who are today serving \nas members of the same court to which we seek to have Mr. Estrada \nnominated, five had no previous judicial experience at the time they \nwere nominated and confirmed by this body. I don't know whether the \nsame objection was raised then or not, but if it was, it has obviously \nbeen proven that it was not a valid objection.\n  There has been an allegation that the administration has refused to \nproduce memoranda that Mr. Estrada wrote as an Assistant to the \nSolicitor General. Mr. Estrada was Assistant to the Solicitor General \nboth in the Clinton administration as well as in the Bush \nadministration. There is just a wealth of knowledge that he gained by \nvirtue of the fact that he worked for the Government in addition to \nserving in the private sector as a lawyer.\n  But while he was in the Solicitor General's Office, sure, he did what \nhis boss told him to do. If it required research and giving his boss a \nmemorandum on a particular issue, he did what he was told to do and, \nobviously, did it in a very efficient manner, because every single \nliving Solicitor General has come forward, including those\n\n[[Page S2399]]\n\nfor whom Mr. Estrada worked, and has said that it would be improper for \nthe Justice Department to produce the memoranda that Mr. Estrada worked \non and provided to his boss. And also, the Solicitor General for whom \nhe worked, both in the Clinton administration as well as in the Bush \nadministration, have both talked about how highly qualified and how \ncompetent this individual is.\n  For an objection to be made that he failed to produce memoranda that \nthe Justice Department says would not be proper to present, and that \nRepublican and Democratic Solicitor Generals say would not be proper \nfor the Justice Department to present, I think totally negates any \nargument about the fact that those memoranda have not been produced.\n  I could go on and on about the issues relative to Mr. Estrada's \nnomination that had been presented by the other side. I repeat, every \ntime one of those issues has been raised, Chairman Hatch or some other \nmember on this side has totally refuted that argument.\n  I go back to the point of why are we here? Why are we, 100 Members of \nthis body, here? We are here to do the people's work. We are here to do \nwhat is in the best interest, not just of our constituents, but in the \ncase of judges, we are required--and I agree with the Senator from \nMassachusetts, we ought not be a rubberstamp. But we have a process we \ngo through to nominate and confirm judges. We ought to have full, open, \nand free debate on each and every one of those nominees, and we have \ndone that.\n  We are here to do the work of the people of the United States of \nAmerica. The people of the United States of America elected us to have \nfull, free, and open debate on judges, as well as the many other issues \nwith which we have to deal. We have done that. We have had 9 days of \ndebate on the nomination of Miguel Estrada. It is time now that we do \nwhat the people elected us to do, and that is to vote. If a Member \nthinks he ought not be confirmed, vote against him.\n  I think he ought to be confirmed because he is well qualified and his \ntime to go to the Federal bench has come. I am going to vote to confirm \nhim. Because we are here as elected officials and because we have a \nduty to represent not just the people who sent us but the people of \nAmerica when it comes to the confirmation of judges, we owe those \npeople who sent us here and the people all across America a response to \nthat obligation. We should move this nomination forward to a vote.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I wish to take an opportunity to discuss the \nappointment of Miguel Estrada to the circuit court and to raise an \nobjection I share with other colleagues on this side of the aisle.\n  I come out of the business world. I think of how I might react if I \nwere interviewing a senior executive candidate, and if that individual \nrefused to answer relevant questions about his experience or her views, \nor what kind of a life attitude had developed in that person's mind, I \nsure would not be putting them on my payroll.\n  To respond to our colleague from Georgia who raises legitimate \nquestions about why there is opposition on our side, the Senator \nchallenges the fact that Mr. Estrada's lack of experience--I think if I \nheard him correctly--could even be an asset.\n  The Senator also alluded to the fact he came here without experience. \nI certainly did. I came here directly from the business community. I \ncame here without experience. He and I and the occupant of the Chair \nhave a job that is less than permanent. My colleague from Georgia and \nmy colleague in the Chair got here because they terminated someone \nelse's tenure in office. If that was the condition, if we were not \ntalking about a lifetime appointment, we would not be having this \ndebate, in my view. I am sure we would have had a vote and probably \napproved for Mr. Estrada to assume the appeals court bench.\n  That is not the case. Nor is it the case that the advise and consent \nrelationship of a recommendation that comes from the President means \nautomatic consent. We are supposed to take these responsibilities \nseriously. I am not a lawyer, but I feel the full measure of a \ndemocracy is the way justice is dispensed. We have a separation of \npowers to make sure there are checks and balances. That is why we \nprotect the judiciary from being tossed out of office willy-nilly. They \nare able to exercise their will and exercise it to the best of their \nability. But we have an obligation to confirm what the best of their \nability is.\n\n  I am not happy about entering this discussion like this because I do \nhave respect for colleagues on the other side of the aisle. I think \nthey should have every right to add their views of support, to register \nthose views as diligently and as forcefully as we have seen.\n  This is a two-way street. When a Democratic President sent up \nnominations, the delays were interminable. We heard last night about \n1,500-day delays without being able to get a hearing. That is over 4 \nyears.\n  I register my opposition to the confirmation of Mr. Estrada for the \nCircuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. My opposition \nstems from several reasons, particularly questions about his \nunwillingness to come forward to discuss his views, to say to the \nAmerican people--because they are ultimately the folks who are \nlistening--that he is unwilling to participate in the system as it \nexists; that he is challenging the advice and consent aspect of the \nSenate's approval of asserting himself as a viable candidate for the \nUnited States Court of Appeals; that he is unwilling to open up his \nviews to the people who are responsible for making the judgment.\n  Last night, I listened eagerly to the debate that took place. I \nlistened to the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee--a \nfriend, someone I have known for a long time--talk about how unfair we \nare being to the President of the United States in not giving him full \nrecognition of the fact he is the President and he is entitled to make \nhis recommendation. The Constitution is so clear. The Constitution says \nthe nomination has to come to the Senate for advice and consent. That \nis the process. We are not violating any rule by raising these \nquestions.\n  Last night, it was even insinuated there might be some racial issue \ntied up here, and that borders on the ludicrous. I point out that the \nPuerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund, the Mexican American \nLegal Defense and Educational Fund, the National Council of La Raza, \nNAACP, and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus all oppose Mr. Estrada's \nnomination. These organizations obviously are not prejudiced against \nHispanics.\n  Any illusion, any suggestion, any insinuation that there could be a \nracial concern here is an outrageous claim.\n  So we are going to leave those comments behind. They are without \nmerit and without consideration. I have real substantial concerns about \nthis nominee.\n  His former supervisor at the Justice Department concluded:\n\n       He lacks the judgment and is too much of an ideolog to be \n     an appeals court judge.\n\n  We have a right to hear what his views are. It is especially \ntroubling because we are talking about a nominee to the DC Circuit, the \nmost important court outside the Supreme Court in this country. The DC \nCircuit overseas enforcement of critical environmental, consumer, and \nworker protection laws. Three sitting U.S. Supreme Court Justices have \ncome from the DC Circuit. It is an enormously important position and it \nis, once again, a lifetime position.\n  If we were to do anything except fully exercise our conscience to \nmake sure that we understood as clearly as each one of us has not only \nthe right but the obligation to do to examine what this individual \nbrings to the position, we would be shirking our responsibilities.\n  Last night we heard talk about the fact that the Mexican American \nLegal Defense and Educational Fund, and other groups, have raised \nconcerns about Mr. Estrada's view on a subject that I am particularly \nconcerned about: racial profiling. The concern is that Mr. Estrada's \nsupport for so-called antiloitering laws were actually a guise for \nracial profiling.\n  Racial profiling is a terrible problem. We had a very difficult time \nin the\n\n[[Page S2400]]\n\nState of New Jersey with that issue. I introduced racial profiling \nprohibition legislation in the Senate, and I am pleased to work with my \ncolleague from Wisconsin, Senator Feingold, on that issue now.\n  Driving while black, walking while Hispanic--we have heard those \nphrases--should not be crimes. I think the courts must do all they can \nto prevent this practice. I am worried that Mr. Estrada's views go in \nanother direction.\n  Another major problem with this nominee is that he seems to be hiding \nthe ball, not playing the game the way it ought to be, refusing to \ndiscuss his basic legal theories and beliefs. The Constitution does not \nsay the President of the United States has a unilateral right to put \nanybody he wants to on the Federal bench. Presidential appointments \nrequire, as I said before, the advice and consent of the Senate, and \nthat certainly does not suggest automatic consent.\n  We have a constitutional obligation to evaluate the President's \nchoices. As all judicial nominees, Mr. Estrada had his job interview \nbefore the Judiciary Committee. At his Judiciary Committee hearings, \nMr. Estrada refused to answer important questions. My colleagues who \nserve on that committee asked the appropriate questions about his \njudicial philosophy, such as his views on key Supreme Court decisions, \nbut he failed to respond or was unwilling to respond to fundamental and \nsimple questions expected of a nominee before that committee.\n  I mentioned that before I came to the Senate I ran a pretty good \nsized company, and when we would interview people for important \npositions in our company we would expect them to be completely \nresponsive to our inquiries. If someone was evasive, refused to answer \nreasonable questions, we would not hire them. It would not be fair to \nour shareholders, our customers, and the other employees of the company \nto hire someone who refused to answer basic questions about how they \nwould handle the job.\n  In the case of Miguel Estrada, we have someone who refused to answer \nquestions regarding his nomination for a lifetime position. We, in the \nSenate, have a constitutional responsibility to review the nominees \nfully and have our consciences clear when we decide their fate. This \nnomination should not move forward because Mr. Estrada has left too \nmany questions unanswered. He has kept many of his views on important \nlegal matters a mystery, and that is not how this process should work. \nThat is not how it is going to work.\n\n  This has nothing to do with anyone's ethnic background. That is \nsilly. This Democratic caucus is always looking to expand diversity, \nand everybody knows that. This debate is about a nominee who is not \ncooperating. If he thinks Roe v. Wade is unsound law, let him say it. \nIf he thinks it is settled law and respects it as a judge, let him say \nthat. I do not think this nominee should move forward until serious \nquestions about his legal philosophy have been answered.\n  Some of my colleagues on the other side act as if this is \nunprecedented for a Presidential nominee to not receive a vote, but \nthere were Clinton nominees who could not even receive a hearing, no \nless a vote. I wish to remind the Senate of some of the names we heard \nfrom our Democratic whip the other day, people such as Judith \nMcConnell, John Tait, John Snodgrass, Patrick Toole, Wenona Whitfield, \nLeland Shurin, John Bingler, Bruce Greer, Sue Ellen Myerscough, Cheryl \nWattley, Michael Schattman, James A. Beaty, Jr.; J. Rich Leonard, \nAnabelle Rodriguez-Rodriguez, Helene White, Jorge Rangel, Jeffrey \nColeman, James Klein, Robert Freedberg, Lynette Norton, Robert Raymar, \na fellow from New Jersey whose name came up, could not get a hearing, \nLegrome Davis, Lynne Lasry, Barry Goode, H. Alston Johnson, James \nDuffy, Elana Kagan, James Wynn, Kathleen McCree-Lewis, Enrique Moreno, \nJames Lyons, Kent Markus, Robert Cindrich, and the list of those who \nwaited for such long periods is rather lengthy. We are talking about 57 \nnominees who were never allowed votes by the Republican-controlled \nSenate: 31 circuit and 48 district judges, 57 of those never allowed \nvotes; 31 circuit court nominees, 22 blocked from getting a vote or \nbeing confirmed. There is person after person. One person waited more \nthan 1,500 days, Helene White, never to be allowed a hearing or a vote. \nRichard Paez waited more than 1,500 days, finally confirmed. The list \ngoes on.\n  So when I hear the complaining about how unfair the Democrats have \nbeen, I just say look back over our shoulder not too long ago and see \nthe number of people who waited and waited and could not get any \nattention at all.\n  Mr. Estrada is getting attention, a lot of attention, and if he was \nresponsive appropriately, I am positive a vote would have taken place \nand we would all have registered our opinion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senator Byrd wished to come to the floor and \nspeak for about 45 minutes. I spoke to him a few minutes ago. He \nindicated he would be ready to go at quarter after 5. The Senator from \nWashington wishes to speak for 10 or 12 minutes. So I do not think it \nwould greatly inconvenience anyone if I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenator from Washington be recognized for up to 12 minutes, and \nfollowing her statement that Senator Byrd be recognized for up to 45 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the nomination of \nMiguel Estrada to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of \nColumbia. Throughout my service in the Senate, we have struggled with \njudicial nominations. I know we can make the process work.\n  In Washington State, I worked with a Republican Senator and a \nDemocratic President to nominate and confirm Federal judges, and today, \nwith a Republican President I am working with my Democratic colleague \nfrom Washington State on a bipartisan process to recommend judicial \ncandidates.\n  I have also seen the process work in the Senate. My Democratic Senate \ncolleagues agreed to confirm 100 Federal judges during the period of \nthe 107th Congress when Democrats were in the majority. That is a great \naccomplishment for a Democratic Senate and a Republican President.\n  There were also periods during the Clinton administration where the \nRepublican Senate confirmed significant numbers of judges appointed by \na Democratic President. It is important to put this standoff in the \nproper context. We are considering a nominee to the DC Circuit Court \nwhich is widely acknowledged as the second highest court in our \ncountry.\n  This court has jurisdiction over a broad array of critical issues \ninvolving workers rights, civil liberties, disabilities, and \nenvironmental regulations. Judges at the DC Circuit Court are often \ngiven serious consideration for service on the United States Supreme \nCourt. This is a lifetime appointment. Neither the President nor the \nSenate can revisit this nomination once it has been confirmed.\n  All of these factors--the importance of the DC Circuit, the potential \nof consideration for the Supreme Court, and the lifetime appointment--\nsignal Members to proceed with caution. We are not considering a \nnomination to a commission or an ambassadorship or some other Senate-\nconfirmable position. This is different. This is a lifetime appointment \nfor a Federal judge whose rulings over the next 30 or 40 or more years \nwill have ramifications for every single American.\n  I respect President Bush's role in nominating Miguel Estrada. I \nrespect the majority's right, working with the President, from the same \nparty, to promptly move judicial appointments. I come to the floor \ntoday to ask my colleagues to respect the Senate's constitutional \nadvice and consent responsibilities. As Senators, we are elected to \nserve our constituents. We are asked to confirm judges whose decisions \ncan change U.S. history and shape the lives of the American people for \ngenerations to come. That is a tremendous responsibility. I know all \nSenators take it very seriously.\n  Let me say a few words about the nominee now before the Senate. \nMiguel Estrada, by all accounts, is an accomplished lawyer with a \ncompelling personal history. But I owe it to my constituents to make an \ninformed judgment on his nomination. At this time I\n\n[[Page S2401]]\n\nam simply not prepared to move forward with a vote on the nomination of \nMiguel Estrada because there is too little information for me to make \nan informed decision. I encourage the majority leader to take this \nnomination off the floor at this time. We expect Federal judges to \nprovide the proper check in our system of checks and balances outlined \nin the Constitution. Without it, our system does not function properly.\n  We must ensure each nominee has sufficient experience to sit in \njudgment of our fellow citizens, will be fair to all those who come \nbefore their court, will be evenhanded in administering justice, and \nwill protect the rights and liberties of all Americans. To determine if \na nominee meets those standards, we need to explore their record, ask \nquestions, and weigh their responses. Miguel Estrada and the \nadministration have failed to address these basic issues. And without \naddressing these basic issues, I cannot assess the nominee's \nqualifications. From my perspective, the Senate has been asked to \nconfirm a candidate about whom we know very little. I cannot at this \ntime vote to confirm Miguel Estrada for lifetime service on the DC \nCircuit Court.\n  As several of my colleagues have done, I need only to invoke the \nwords of the chairman of the Judiciary Committee to describe my \nhesitancy to move forward with the Estrada nomination. Speaking of \nPresident Clinton's judicial nominees and the Senate, Senator Hatch \nsaid the Senate will have ``to be more diligent and extensive in its \nquestioning of nominees' jurisprudential views.''\n  Mr. Estrada and the administration have failed to meet the same \nstandard set out by Senator Hatch. Mr. Estrada has failed to provide \nthrough his writing, his experience, or through answers to questions at \nthe Judiciary Committee, any meaningful insight into his likely \ndecisionmaking process as a Federal judge. He has very limited \nscholarly or judicial experience. He did work in the Solicitor \nGeneral's Office at the Department of Justice during the 1990s. But, \nunfortunately, the administration has refused to provide the Senate \nwith or characterize any opinions he wrote or had while at DOJ.\n  Despite repeated requests from Senators, the nominee and the \nadministration have refused to provide information that can help all \nSenators determine whether Miguel Estrada is deserving of confirmation \nto a lifetime appointment to the Federal bench. Allowing Senators to \naccess the memoranda he wrote while at the Solicitor General's office \nis particularly important.\n  Unlike most judicial nominees, he has nothing on paper to give us any \nindication as to how he would rule on the bench. In fact, Mr. Estrada \nhas not had any published legal writings since he was in law school.\n  Time and again, we are told by the administration that Miguel Estrada \nis a brilliant lawyer and more than qualified to serve on the D.C. \nCircuit Court. Yet, all we have to base a decision on his nomination \nare the endorsements of others. I appreciate these endorsements, but \neach of us as Senators must reach our own conclusions based on the \nfacts. I am greatly troubled by the silence we have heard from the \nnominee himself.\n  The path to confirmation for a judicial nominee is indeed a difficult \none. But in the case of Mr. Estrada, the nominee and the administration \nwent beyond anything we are accustomed to and brought great difficulty \nupon themselves. At his confirmation hearing before the Judiciary \nCommittee, Mr. Estrada refused to give Senators straight answers to \nmost of their questions.\n  Many of our Judiciary Committee colleagues have discussed this \nnomination at great length here on the floor. I have listened to the \nstatements from both Democrats and Republicans on the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  The words of Senator Feinstein stands out as I look at this \nnomination. Let me share them again with the Senate.\n  Senator Feinstein said:\n\n       I have been reviewing background materials about Miguel \n     Estrada, talking to those who have concerns about him, and I \n     have re-read the transcript from Mr. Estrada's hearing.\n       I must say that throughout this process, I have been struck \n     by the truly unique lack of information we have about this \n     nominee, and the lack of answers he has given to the many \n     questions raised by Members of this Committee.\n       He, essentially, is a blank slate. And, if confirmed, he \n     could serve for 30, 40, or even 50 years on one of the \n     highest courts in the Nation. We has better be right about \n     this decision.\n\n  Mr. President, I agree with that assessment. The Senate must be right \nabout this decision. That is why so many on this side of the aisle have \nasked the majority leader to help us be right about the Miguel Estrada \nnomination.\n  At a minimum, Mr. Estrada should be sent back to the Judiciary \nCommittee for more questioning. In the Committee, he should be more \nforward in answering the questions of Senators. He should be more \nwilling to release information regarding his opinions about important \njudicial matters.\n  Mr. Estrada was asked to name any case in the history of the Supreme \nCourt with which he disagreed. Surely, Mr. Estrada--who served as the \neditor of the Harvard Law Review--can cite a case that he disagrees \nwith. At his original confirmation hearing, Mr. Estrada could not cite \na single case before the Supreme Court he disagreed with. The Senate \nshould give Mr. Estrada another opportunity to answer this question \nbefore the Judiciary Committee.\n  Mr. Estrada was asked to name a Supreme Court judge that he admired. \nWhen he refused to answer this question, Mr. Estrada was asked to name \nany Federal judge that he admired. Again, Mr. Estrada refused. The \nSenate should give Mr. Estrada another opportunity to answer this \nquestion before the Judiciary Committee.\n  Unless the Senate is able to learn more about Miguel Estrada, I am \nleft to conclude that this nominee has no judge he would try to \nemulate, no judicial philosophy he follows, and no opinion on any \nimportant case that has ever come before the Supreme Court.\n  Without so little information to determine how Mr. Estrada will rule \nas a Federal judge on important matters of labor rights, rights of \nprivacy, civil rights and environmental regulation, I cannot consent to \nconsidering his nomination at this time.\n  I strongly encourage the majority leader to withdraw this nomination \nand send it back to the Judiciary Committee. I encourage the President \nand the nominee to address the many issues raised by Senators.\n  The ultimate fate of the Miguel Estrada nomination--was well as the \nSenate's ability to move forward with bipartisan support for judicial \nnominees--rests with the majority leader and the President of the \nUnited States.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia, who is to be recognized following the statement of the \nSenator from Washington, has agreed the Senator from Arkansas could \nspeak for up to 6 minutes prior to his speech. There is no one here on \nthat side, so I don't think it inconveniences anyone.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the order now in effect be changed to \nallow her to speak for up to 6 minutes before Senator Byrd speaks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I certainly thank my colleague from West \nVirginia for his courtesy and kindness in letting me go forward. I \nappreciate it.\n  Mr. President, I come to the floor today to express my frustration \nwith the nomination of Miguel Estrada to the Court of Appeals for the \nDC Circuit. I have never before opposed a judicial nominee, but after \nmuch prayer and reflection I cannot support this nominee until he is \nable and willing to cooperate with the Senate in its Constitutional \nresponsibility to advise and consent. I believe all executive and \njudicial nominations that come before the U.S. Senate are entitled to \ncourtesy and respect. I also believe the U.S. Senate's role of advise \nand consent is an important check and balance that our forefathers \ninstituted, and it is an obligation that I do not take lightly. I know \nour forefathers put it there for a good reason. Each nominee is \nentitled to a thorough and fair hearing, and I have fully evaluated \neach of President Bush's nominees as the Constitution\n\n[[Page S2402]]\n\nmandates. In every case before us, I have supported President Bush's \nnominees. Yet I can not in good conscience support this nominee at this \ntime based on the lack of information that has been made available and \nthe manner in which this nomination has been presented. Is it too much \nto ask of a person who is being offered a lifetime position to simply \nanswer a few questions?\n  As a nominee seeking Senate confirmation, Mr. Estrada has the burden \nof proof to demonstrate his fitness for the high office he seeks. \nDuring the confirmation process, a nominee can meet this burden in many \nways depending in part on the background and experience of an \nindividual at the time of appointment. Another consideration is the \nlevel of scrutiny warranted for a life-time appointment to an important \njudgeship. Finally, one critical element I look for in all nominees is \na willingness to cooperate with the Senate and show deference and \nrespect for the process we engage in here in the Senate.\n  As many of my colleagues have already established, Mr. Estrada comes \nto the Senate with a very limited written record upon which to make an \ninformed judgment. To make our job even more difficult, the \nadministration has refused to release relevant information that would \nshed much needed light on this nominee's judicial philosophy and \nreasoning. Moreover, Mr. Estrada seemed determined to be evasive and \nunresponsive to questions put to him during his confirmation hearing.\n\n  After weighing these factors, reviewing the committee record, meeting \npersonally with Mr. Estrada, and considering the views of hundreds of \nconstituents and interested organizations, I am not satisfied that Mr. \nEstrada has met the burden required for confirmation to such an \nimportant position.\n  Even though Mr. Estrada is reluctant or unwilling to say so, I assume \nMr. Estrada has a conservative ideology and that he and I would \ndisagree on many issues. But after voting for every judicial nominee to \ncome before the Senate since I took office, I can say with credibility \nthat Mr. Estrada's ideology doesn't prevent me from supporting his \nnomination. A nominee's particular views or political beliefs don't \nbother me, so long as I am confident that nominee can separate his \npersonal beliefs and opinions from his duty as a Federal judge to \nfollow established precedent and interpret the law and Constitution \nfairly and without political bias.\n  What concerns me a good deal, however, is the unwillingness of the \nadministration and Mr. Estrada to respond directly to reasonable \nrequests for legitimate information. How hard is it to answer questions \nabout Supreme Court cases that have been on the books for years? Why is \nthe administration so unwilling to allow U.S. Senators to review \nwritten material that would help us discharge our duty under the \nConstitution?\n  I believe having judges from different backgrounds is important, and \nI salute President Bush for nominating an Hispanic to serve on this \ncourt. I fully support efforts to diversity the Federal judiciary so \nthat it is more representative of our society. But I cannot support Mr. \nEstrada simply because he is Hispanic.\n  Charges of racial insensitivity have no place in this debate. This \nSenate has already confirmed unanimously seven of President Bush's \nHispanic judicial nominees.\n  Like all nominees that come before the Senate, Mr. Estrada must \nanswer questions put before him. I want to make clear that the \nquestions Democrats asked of Mr. Estrada are no different than the \nquestions Republicans have asked of nominees. In fact, when the current \nAttorney General served on the Senate Judiciary Committee, he asked a \njudicial nominee the same question that Mr. Estrada refused to answer. \nThe question was: ``Which judge has served as a model for the way you \nwould conduct yourself as a judge and why?'' Mr. Estrada was asked and \nrefused to answer a similar question.\n  When I let my boys off at school this morning--they are 6 years old \nand in the first grade--they were having problems with a buddy at \nschool, in their class. They were saying: What do we do with this, Mom? \nHow do we handle it?\n  Do you know what I said to them? I said: Work with him. Figure it \nout. Work with him.\n  That is simple, and it is simply what Democrats have told Mr. \nEstrada: Work with us. We are trying to do our job, to satisfy our \nconstitutional responsibility, in good conscience, to meet the job we \nare sent here to do by the constituents who believe in us. If that \nmeans reviewing oral arguments and briefs of a few cases so that Mr. \nEstrada can state an opinion on at least one case decided by the \nSupreme Court in the last 40 years, why not do it? No one disagrees \nthat Mr. Estrada has a distinguished academic and professional \nbackground. He is a very nice man. I met with him. My responsibility is \nnot just to put nice people into judgeships.\n  He graduated magna cum laude from Columbia and magna cum laude from \nHarvard Law School, served as editor for Harvard Law Review, and \nclerked for a Supreme Court Justice. It should not take him more than \nan afternoon, or less, to do a little research so that he could answer \nthe questions that members of the Judiciary Committee have put before \nhim.\n  I call on the administration to let Mr. Estrada answer the questions \nthe Senate has put before him, in good faith, so that the Senate can \nvote on Mr. Estrada. Is it really too much to ask, to simply say we \nneed more information to make an important judgment on a very \nimportant, lifetime nomination? Please, give us the ability to execute \nour responsibilities under the Constitution. Is it too much to ask of \none man, who is before us, who has the burden of proof, to show us his \ncapabilities? Is it too much to ask, to simply say let's spend a couple \nof more hours, answer a few questions, and move forward? Because this \nNation has a great deal to deal with. We have many issues on our plates \nand many things we need to address immediately. I simply say to my \ncolleagues, is it too much to ask, to simply answer a few questions?\n  Mr. President, I especially thank my colleague from West Virginia for \nhis yielding to me and allowing me to move forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, may I say to the distinguished Senator from \nArkansas, my favorite Supreme Court Justice was John Marshall. It is \nnot a very hard question to answer.\n\n\n                    U.S. RHETORIC GOES OVER THE TOP\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the language of diplomacy is imbued with \ncourtesy and discretion. Diplomats the world over can be counted on to \nchoose each word of every public statement with precision, for an ill-\nreceived demarche could turn allies into adversaries or cooperation \ninto confrontation.\n  Like most professions, diplomacy has its own lexicon. As John Kenneth \nGalbraith wrote in 1969, ``There are few ironclad rules of diplomacy \nbut to one there is no exception: when an official reports that talks \nwere useful, it can safely be concluded that nothing was \naccomplished.'' And when we hear a seasoned envoy refer to a ``frank \nand open discussion,'' we know that he is actually talking about a \nknock-down, drag-out fight behind closed doors. While negotiation can \nsteer great powers away from a course that would lead to war, we can \nusually count on public statements about diplomacy to be \nunderwhelming--not overwhelming but underwhelming.\n  There have been exceptional times when bold statements have energized \nworld opinion. When President Reagan stood on the Berlin Wall in 1987 \nand proclaimed, ``Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall,'' he spoke to \nmillions of Germans who longed to be freed from oppression. While I \nwould not go so far as to credit a single phrase with hastening the \nfall of the Eastern Bloc, certainly President Reagan's statement \nreflected the resolve of the West to oppose communism.\n  There have also been a fair number of bold statements to the world \nthat have backfired. For example, Nikita Khrushchev squandered whatever \ncredit he might have gained through a goodwill tour of the United \nStates in 1959, when he visited the United Nations the next year. The \nSoviet Premier famously exclaimed to the West, ``We will bury\n\n[[Page S2403]]\n\nyou,'' while slamming his shoe on the table in front of him. This ill-\nadvised outburst was a vivid depiction of an irrational and out-of-\ncontrol superpower.\n  Fortunately, the United States has a tradition in foreign policy of \nbeing slow to anger. We have nurtured a reputation of being rational \nand deliberate. I doubt that Americans would have much tolerance for a \npresident who used the United Nations as a forum for testing the \nconstruction of his footwear on the nearest table. It would be a great \ndeparture for the United States to use its foreign policy organs as a \nmeans to spread divisive rhetoric.\n  Unfortunately, the tone of our foreign policy in recent months has \nbeen in a steady decline. To some of our allies, the United States, \nthrough its words and its actions on the crisis in Iraq, is beginning \nto look more like a rogue superpower than the leader of the free world. \nMany newspapers in European capitals criticize U.S. policy toward Iraq. \nModerate Muslim nations, such as Jordan and Turkey, are growing \nprogressively suspicious of American motives in the war against \nterrorism. An increasing number of people in Arab countries are \ncoalescing around an outright hatred of the United States.\n  Let us remember that President Bush came to office promising to \nchange the tone in Washington. I wonder if the current tone of American \nforeign policy is what he had in mind? One source of alarm is the tone \nof the National Security Strategy released by the White House in \nSeptember 2002. In broad strokes, the strategy argues that the United \nStates should use its overwhelming military power to engage in \npreemptive strikes to prevent others from ever developing the means to \nthreaten our country. The strategy notes a preference for working with \nallies to keep the peace, but underscores the willingness of the United \nStates to act unilaterally.\n  The content and the tone of these important pronouncements in the \nNational Security Strategy sparked outcry, in the United States and \naround the world. The report gave critics plenty of ammunition to make \ntheir case that the United States is a 400 pound gorilla that will stop \nat nothing to get its way. Our strategy leaves much of the world the \nimpression that Americans agree with the quotation of the late Chinese \nleader, Zhou Enlai, which turned the axiom uttered by the military \nstrategist Carl von Clausewitz on his head: ``All diplomacy is a \ncontinuation of war by other means.''\n  There are many examples of provocative rhetoric that have escalated \nthe stakes of our standoff with Iraq. In his 2002 State of the Union \nAddress, the President coined an ``Axis of Evil,'' comprised of Iran, \nIraq, and North Korea. In October 2002, the White House press secretary \nsuggested that regime change in Iraq could be accomplished with ``the \ncost of one bullet.'' On December 30, 2002, President Bush said that \nSaddam's ``day of reckoning is coming.'' The next day, he chided a \nreporter who asked about the prospect of war in Iraq by saying, ``I'm \nthe person who gets to decide, not you.'' The President's coarse words \ndid nothing to ease criticism of American unilateralism.\n  Several members of the President's national security team warned Iraq \nin January 2003 that ``time is running out'' for Iraq, and that such \ntime was measured in weeks, not months. On Sunday talk show interviews \non January 29, the White House Chief of Staff refused to rule out the \nuse of nuclear weapons in a war against Iraq. On February 6, President \nBush ominously declared that ``the game is over.'' With each of these \nstatements, the chances of war appeared to grow.\n  To be fair, the President and his advisors have repeatedly stated a \npreference for the peaceful disarmament of Iraq. But as I speak right \nnow, many Americans believe that war is inevitable. Through words and \nthrough action, the United States appears to be on a collision course \nwith war in the Persian Gulf. Stating a preference for a peaceful \nsolution is not enough to alter the heading of our great ship of state.\n  If our rhetoric toward Iraq is not alarming enough, the last weeks \nhave seen an appalling increase in criticism of our allies and the \nUnited Nations.\n  On September 12, 2002, President Bush delivered a strong and \neffective speech that urged the United Nations to take action to disarm \nIraq. The President said: ``All the world now faces a test, and the \nUnited Nations [faces] a difficult and defining moment. Are Security \nCouncil resolutions to be honored and enforced, or cast aside without \nconsequence? Will the United Nations serve the purpose of its founding, \nor will it be irrelevant?''\n  The President threw down the gauntlet, and the United Nations acted. \nInspectors have returned to Iraq, and they are doing their job. The \ninspectors have asked for more time, but the President has now \nchallenged the U.N. to authorize the use of force, or again face \nirrelevance.\n  And so, the world is now wondering, which is the greater threat to \nthe relevance of the U.N.: a rogue nation that flaunts the will of the \ninternational community; or a permanent member of the Security Council \nthat views the institution as useless unless the institution submits to \nits will? This hand has been overplayed. More threats of U.N. \nirrelevance will only portray the United States as a bully superpower.\n  European allies who do not share our view on the crisis in Iraq have \nrecently been in the cross hairs for verbal bombardment. Secretary of \nDefense Rumsfeld has lumped Germany in with Libya and Cuba as the \nprincipal opponents of war in Iraq. He also characterized Germany and \nFrance as being ``Old Europe,'' as if their economic and political \npower does not matter as compared to the number of Eastern countries \nthat comprise New Europe.\n  Richard Perle, a senior advisor to the Department of Defense, has \nalso had choice words about our European allies. In October 2002, Mr. \nPerle recommended that German Chancellor Schroeder resign in order to \nimprove relations between our two countries. On January 30, Mr. Perle \nfollowed up this charge by saying: ``Germany has become irrelevant. And \nit is not easy for a German chancellor to lead his country into \nirrelevance.'' Spreading his criticism around, Mr. Perle stated that \n``France is no longer the ally that it once was.'' So far as I can tell \nfrom press reports, Mr. Perle, who is the Chairman of the Defense \nPolicy Board, has not been admonished for his inflammatory statements.\n  Such vindictive criticism of our European allies has had \nrepercussions. According to a new poll, published in the Financial \nTimes Deutchland on February 10, 57 percent of Germans agree with the \nstatement, ``The United States is a nation of warmongers.'' And now we \nfind ourselves in a pointless stalemate with our NATO partners over \nmilitary assistance to Turkey. If we had been more temperate in our \nrhetoric, perhaps we could have worked through the anti-American tone \nof the recent elections in Germany. Instead, we find ourselves \nescalating a war of words against two great European powers, who were \npowers--and who were great powers--before ours became a republic.\n  And so, Mr. President, how we communicate our foreign policy makes a \ndifference. We expect North Korea or Iraq to use inflammatory \npropaganda to speak to the world, but we are a more dignified nation. \nThere are ways for our country to indicate resolve without resorting to \nbellicosity. The subtext to nearly every new White House statement on \nIraq is that the United States has run out of patience. The \nadministration is signaling its willingness to use an extreme amount of \nmilitary force against Iraq when many still question the need to do so, \nwhen many in our own country still question the need to do so, when \nsome in this Senate still question the need to do so at this time. We \nneed to change our tone.\n\n  Impetuous rhetoric has added fuel to the crisis with Iraq and \nstrained our alliances. Before committing our Nation to war with Iraq \nand the years of occupation that will surely follow, we should repair \nthe damage to our relations with our allies. I urge the President, and \nthe administration, to change the tone of our foreign policy--to turn \naway from threatening Iraq with war, to turn away from insulting our \nfriends and allies, to turn away from threatening the United Nations \nwith irrelevance. Our rhetoric has gone awry, our rhetoric has gone \nover the top, from giving an indication of our strength to giving an \nindication of our recklessness.\n\n[[Page S2404]]\n\n  I have learned from 50 years in Congress that it is unwise to insult \none's adversaries, for tomorrow you may be in need of an ally. I have \nfound in my 56 years in politics that today's opponent may be \ntomorrow's friend. There will come the day when we will seek the \nassistance of those same European allies with which we are now feuding. \nBut serious rifts are threatening our close relationship with some of \nthe great powers--the truly great powers of history--some of the great \npowers of Western Europe. The Secretary of State said yesterday that \nNATO is at risk of breaking up. Mr. President, it is time that we \npause. It is time that we take a look at ourselves. It is time to put \nour bluster and swagger away for the time being. I urge the President \nto calm his rhetoric, repair our alliances, and slow down in the charge \nto war.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, last night I sat in my office listening \nto my colleagues, most on the other side of the aisle, debating the \nissue of Miguel Estrada's nomination to the second most powerful court \nin the country, the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals. Even \nafter all of the debate, some people may not realize that the D.C. \nCircuit Court is the overseer of all Federal agencies. It is the court \nthat is most likely to make decisions about whether Federal regulations \nwill be upheld or overturned, whether reproductive rights will be \nretained or lost, or whether intrusive Government actions will be \nallowed or curtailed.\n  I understand why some of my colleagues last night may have become \nheated with the determination of our side of the aisle to filibuster \nthis nomination. Many of my colleagues wanted to know why we believed \nwe had no other choice but to filibuster the nomination.\n  It is time we quit dancing around the issue. The question that has \ngotten so many of us concerned is whether this body is going to approve \nBush administration nominees to the court of appeals who are out of \nstep with the mainstream views of America.\n  Someone said last night: Maybe that side of the aisle doesn't want to \nappoint conservatives.\n  That is not the issue. What is at issue is we don't want to appoint \nsomeone who clearly refuses to answer questions on key issues of the \nconstitutional right to privacy, only later to find out they will not \nuphold current law on protecting a woman's right to choose!\n  Upholding a woman's right to choose is an important issue of privacy \nand something about which we should all be concerned, It is an issue on \nwhich we have 30 years of settled law, and women across America count \non that right.\n  But there are other stories and other issues of privacy we should \nalso be concerned about. We are at a unique time in our country's \nhistory, a time when U.S. citizens have been treated as enemy \ncombatants and imprisoned without access to counsel or trial by jury. \nWe are at the tip of the iceberg of the information age where \nbusinesses may have access to personal information and exploit that \ninformation. Where health care industry people might have access to \nyour most personal medical information. Where the Government has \nestablished a process of eavesdropping on and tracking U.S. citizens \nwithout probable cause. Where the Government has the ability to use and \ndevelop software that can track one's use of web sites and information \non their personal computer without their consent or knowledge.\n  These are all important privacy questions that deserve to have the \nattention of any nominee to the Circuit Court of Appeals. When Miguel \nEstrada refused to answer the questions my colleagues on the Judiciary \nCommittee posed to him about the issue of privacy, and if he in fact \nbelieved in a constitutional rights to privacy, it was troubling to me \nand to my colleagues who are opposing this nomination. We need to have \nanswers to these questions before Miguel Estrada can be confirmed.\n  Make no mistake--the public is hearing a lot of bickering in the \nChamber about numbers. How many nominees on this side have we pushed \nthrough, how many nominees have they pushed through, when a particular \nparty was in charge. I am not sure the public wants to follow that \ndebate.\n  But one debate I am sure they want to follow is the failure of Miguel \nEstrada to tell us what he believes. A 2001 poll shows that seventy \nfour percent of the American public believes the question of judicial \nphilosophy should be asked of nominees to the appellate court and that \nanswers should be given. Over 50 percent of Americans, in a survey done \nin 2001, believe Members should not vote to confirm otherwise qualified \nnominees if they think their views on important issues are wrong.\n\n  Of course we cannot even make that judgement and we aren't left with \na lot of options, when Miguel Estrada won't specifically answer the \nquestions.\n  Some have said that the issue is simply that we don't like his \nanswers to the questions. I do believe that it is important to view \nthis debate in a larger context. This debate is about what this \nAdministration means when it says we should appoint people to the court \nand who have a strict constructionist view of the Constitution. Like \nmost Americans, I was not entirely sure what that phrase means. So I \nlooked for further clarification. I found some that was very \ninteresting. In January 2000, the President appeared on one of the \nSunday talk shows. And he was asked about strict constructionism. He \nwas asked the following:\n  With regard to strict construction, we will put up on our screens \nsome words from Justice Scalia pertaining to abortion.\n  [Justice Scalia] said: ``There is no constitutional right to \nabortion. I reach that conclusion because of two simple facts: One, the \nConstitution says absolutely nothing about it and, two, the \nlongstanding traditions of American society have permitted it to be \nlegally proscribed.''\n  The host then asked the President, ``Would you ask a nominee that \nquestion? Do you agree with that?''\n  The President responded:\n\n       I guess you would have to say that is my idea of a strict \n     constructionist.\n\n  So when people talk about a strict constructionist, very often they \nare talking about someone who doesn't believe in the constitutionality \nof a woman's right to choose.\n  An editorial in the Atlanta Journal Constitution makes the point as \nwell when they wrote:\n\n       The same spirit of deception is apparent when the topic \n     turns to abortion. Bush is committed to overturning the U.S. \n     Supreme Court decision legalizing early term abortion; but in \n     most settings, he dares not mention the truth because he \n     understands how unpopular it would be. So instead of being \n     frank about his stance, he talks in code of appointing judges \n     who believe in strict construction of the U.S. Constitution.\n\n  Mr. President, I don't think that is what this body should support. \nAnd in this context I do not think we should approve nominees who will \nnot answer questions about their view on whether the right to privacy \nis guaranteed in our Constitution.\n  Make no mistake about it. This is not about someone's political \nviews, this is about each nominees' judicial philosophy. We had a very \ninteresting debate before the Senate Judiciary Committee on a nominee \nto the Tenth Circuit, Michael McConnell. A man who in private practice \nand as a law professor had espoused many views in opposition to \nabortion rights and was very critical of the decision in Roe v. Wade. I \ndo not agree with probably any of the political views of Michael \nMcConnell. Yet he came before our committee and, for hours, outlined \nhis judicial philosophy, his understanding of stare decisis, his view \non where the right to privacy exists within the Constitution and how it \nevolved. He was very specific in saying he thought the issue had been \nsettled. In just one of the many, many answers he gave on privacy he \nsaid:\n\n       I think most scholars would agree. In Roe, the Court \n     canvassed several different possible textural bases and said \n     it didn't matter which one of the bases. It was only in \n     Planned Parenthood v. Casey that the Court finally came down \n     to a single methodology and identified the privacy right as \n     rooted in the substantive due process of the 14th amendment.\n\n\n[[Page S2405]]\n\n\n  Mr. McConnell went on:\n\n       Not only was Roe v. Wade decided by the Supreme Court, but \n     a lot has happened in the 26 to 27 years, or however many it \n     has been, since Roe v. Wade. That decision has now been \n     considered. It has been reconsidered and reaffirmed by \n     justices appointed by Presidents Nixon, Ford, Reagan, Bush, \n     and Clinton after serious re-argument. At the time when Roe \n     v. Wade came down, it was striking down State statutes of 45 \n     of the 50 States of the Union. Today it is much more \n     reflective of the consensus of the American people on the \n     subject.\n\n  I offer this as an example of a nominee who was confirmed! Approved \nwith bipartisan support. Was it because we agreed with his political \nviews on abortion? No. It was because he came before the Senate and \nanswered the question about the constitutionality of people's right to \nchoose.\n  Now, some may say, well, this particular nominee, Miguel Estrada \ndoesn't want to be that specific. We have all heard about this \nparticular court, the District of Columbia, and how important it is to \nour country--the second highest court in the land--and the particulars \nof why this particular nominee may be so important. But again we also \nhave to look at this nominee in context. This is not the first \ntroubling nominee this administration has supported. They have put \nbefore us other individuals who, I believe, have been judicial \nactivists in their role on various courts. We have been successful in \ndefeating their nomination. Although we may be going to see them \nsometime in the future.\n  Several months ago, the President nominated Priscilla Owen to the \nFifth Circuit. In a series of cases interpreting a new Texas law on \nparental consent, Owen suggested that a minor, even in the case of rape \nand incest, should be required to demonstrate that she had received \nreligious counseling before receiving medical care.\n  She insisted that her holding followed Supreme Court precedent, yet \nshe was unable to demonstrate where in the Supreme Court precedent the \nrequirement on religious counseling existed. That is because it \ndoesn't. Our law does not require those seeking abortion to have \nreligious counseling. Her dissent in a similar case was called an \n``unconscionable act of judicial activism,'' by White House Counsel, \nAlberto Gonzales.\n  Another Bush nominee, Charles Pickering, received an unfavorable vote \nfrom the Senate Judiciary Committee last year after it became clear he \nhad intervened on behalf of a convicted cross burner, calling \nprosecutors, including high-level officials in the Department of \nJustice, in an effort to lower the sentence of the convicted cross \nburner. The victim in this case said, after learning for the first time \nabout the role that was played by Judge Pickering, that her ``faith in \nthe judicial system had been destroyed.''\n  This is the context in which we view the nomination of Miguel \nEstrada. It is not clear where Miguel Estrada stands on the issues. He \ndoesn't have a record like Priscilla Owen, or like Judge Pickering, \nabout which we can ask questions. So the fact that he refuses to answer \nthose questions, and the fact that the administration has proclaimed \nthat they are very interested in nominating people with ``strict \nconstructionist'' views about the Constitution, has left us very \nconcerned about this particular nominee.\n  Let me be clear. The public doesn't care about our bickering on \nnumbers, but they do care about us doing our job and asking questions \nabout the nominee's views on important issues.\n  Another survey that was done last year asked whether individuals \nthought the views of nominees on specific issues should be taken into \naccount, that Senators are expected to have a viewpoint by the people \nwho elect them and not simply rubberstamp the nominees the President \nsends to the Senate. And 77 percent found that to be the persuasive \nargument to which they agreed.\n  The public was also asked whether the views of nominees on specific \nissues should be taken into account since Federal judges serve for life \nand are not elected by the people, and no one should be put on the \nbench if that person holds a position on an important issue that \nSenators think is simply wrong. Again, 77 percent of the public \nbelieved that was a persuasive argument and correct.\n  The issue is that the public does want us to do our job. They want us \nto find out the positions of these nominees.\n  It was not that long ago we had another issue before this body, a \nnomination to the Supreme Court of Justice Clarence Thomas. At that \ntime, Judge Thomas refused to answer questions on the right to privacy, \nsaying he thought there had been too much controversy on the issue and \nhe did not have a personal view on whether Roe v. Wade had been rightly \ndecided. But then, only one year later, he dissented in Planned \nParenthood v. Casey stating that Roe v. Wade should be overturned!\n\n  This debate is very alarming to Americans. It is alarming because \nthey want to know that their judiciary represents the views of the \nmainstream public; they want to know that the judiciary will uphold \ncurrent law; that they will follow stare decisis. They want to know \nthat the right of privacy, as it has been recognized in the \nConstitution, will be upheld.\n  We have to go back and do our homework on this particular nominee. I \nthink most people in America understand if you go to take a pass-fail \ntest and you do not answer the questions, it is very hard for you to \npass. We have all heard of oral exams where you have to show and \nunderstand the material you have been studying for years. If you do not \nshow the comprehension of that material, you do not pass. I think \npeople here understand that if you come before the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee and fail to answer the questions, you do not pass as well.\n  Maybe we will not agree on the types of positions this side of the \naisle would support for a nominee. Maybe that side of the aisle does \nsupport people of strict constructionist views who do believe that Roe \nv. Wade should be overturned, but let's not put forth and continue to \npursue a nominee who refuses to answer the questions. These are \nquestions that deserve an answer. These are questions about which this \nbody should hold its head up high and say, as we continue in an age \nwhere privacy is going to become more important, we will continue to \nfight for the rights of the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I haven't had the opportunity in the last \ncouple of days to have my say on Mr. Estrada. I thought I would take \nthe time now to talk a little bit about the nomination of Miguel \nEstrada for the D.C. circuit court.\n  I have to say that there has been a lot of nonsense bandied about in \nthe Chamber on the nomination and the idea of whether we are holding \nsomething up. Facts are bothersome things, as they say. What some \npeople say in the past may come back to haunt them in the future.\n  It was Mo Udall, former Congressman, who coined the wonderful phrase. \nHe always said: O Lord, let me always utter kind and humble words for \ntomorrow morning I may have to eat them.\n  I was looking back through the record. The current chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee in 1997 addressed the Utah chapter of the \nFederalist Society. This is what the current chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee said:\n\n       The Senate can and should do what it can to ascertain the \n     jurisprudential views a nominee will bring to the bench in \n     order to prevent the confirmation of those who are likely to \n     be judicial activists. Determining who will become activist \n     is not easy since many of President Clinton's nominees tend \n     to have limited paper trails. Determining which of President \n     Clinton's nominees would become activist is complicated and \n     would require the Senate to be more diligent and extensive in \n     its questioning of nominees' jurisprudential views.\n\n  That is interesting because when Mr. Estrada refused to answer even \nthe most simple, straightforward questions, that sure doesn't help us \nin questioning his jurisprudential views. There is no doubt in anyone's \nmind that Mr. Estrada is a movement person. He will be a movement \njudge, one who will try to move the court in a certain ideological \ndirection.\n  What also concerned me was something my colleague Senator Hatch from \nUtah said the other day. He said:\n\n       An up or down vote, that is all we ask. If the Democrats \n     have enough votes to defeat Miguel Estrada, I will not \n     complain about it. I might feel badly about it and I might \n     say it was the wrong thing to do, but they have\n\n[[Page S2406]]\n\n     a right to do it. If my colleagues who disagree do not like \n     this, they can speak out. They can give their reason. They \n     can vote no. Politics ought to be left out of it.\n\n  That is what the Senator from Utah said last night. Unfortunately, I \nam sorry that his sentiments didn't exist when President Clinton's \nnominees came up for confirmation. I recall saying just about the same \nthing over and over again on the nomination of Bonnie Campbell to serve \non the Eighth Circuit. She received her hearing in May of 2000 and then \nher nomination was stopped cold. Despite the fact she had the ABA stamp \nof approval, a long and distinguished history in the field of law, \nincluding her work as Iowa's attorney general. Members on both sides of \nthe aisle supported her nomination. On September 21 and October 3, I \ntried to bring it up. Then during the month of October I brought up \nBonnie Campbell's nomination seven times and seven times the Republican \nmajority objected.\n  The Senator from Utah kept talking last night about the Democrats' \ndouble standard. My first instinct is to call that claim laughable. But \nin reality, it is outrageous and duplicitous to us because so many \nextremely well-qualified nominees never got an up-or-down vote on the \nfloor, never got a vote in committee, and many never even got a \nhearing.\n\n  Bonnie Campbell had a hearing, but then they stopped her cold. \nSenator Hatch suggested Bonnie Campbell's nomination came too late in \nthe last year of the last administration. I know for a fact that two of \nSenator Kyl's district court judges were nominated after Bonnie \nCampbell was, and they were confirmed on October 3, 2000.\n  And now back to Mr. Estrada. We're not holding Mr. Estrada up because \nwe feel like spending all of our time through the wee hours of the \nnight talking about him. We're holding up because he hasn't told us \nanything. He hasn't answered the soft ball questions that nearly all \njudicial nominees have more than willingly answered. What's he got to \nhide?\n  I don't know Mr. Estrada. To the best of my knowledge, I never met \nhim. But I do know we have heard from people who do know him, who have \nassociated with him, some of whom have termed him ``scary'' in his \noutlook, scary in what he might do as a judge. I don't know if he is or \nnot, but I know the people who have associated with him have called him \nthat. They think he is some kind of a rightwing kook. I don't know if \nhe is or not. How do we know? Well, the stealth candidate hasn't helped \nwhen he won't even answer the most simple, straightforward questions. \nSo we have no way of knowing one way or the other.\n  It is our job as Senators to examine nominees, their background, \ntheir way of thinking to determine what kind of judges they would be \nand whether or not they can fairly and impartially administer the law. \nAnd as far as this Senator is concerned, I keep coming back to the same \nconclusion: we don't know enough about him to make an informed decision \non his nomination to a lifelong appointment to the second most \nimportant and influential court of the land.\n  Even after I find out more about him, I may vote against him, but I \ndon't think we even have to bring him up for a vote until we know more \nabout Mr. Estrada. Is he a rightwing kook? I don't know. Some people \nsay he is. Some people say he is scary. We have no way of knowing at \nthis point in time. That is why we should not bring his name up. We \nshould not move forward on this until we find out more--unlike Bonnie \nCampbell, who answered all the questions and gave all the documents \nthey ever asked of her. Yet, they would not even bring her name to the \nfloor.\n  So to my friend from Utah who says there is a double standard, I say \nlook in the mirror.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if my friend will yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I thank the Chair. The two managers of the bill--which we \nhope will be on the Senate floor before long--will return before long, \njust so the distinguished Senator from Utah is aware of that.\n  Mr. HATCH. On the appropriations bill.\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. HATCH. I will be happy to yield at any time to them.\n  Mr. President, before I came to the floor, I understand the \ndistinguished Senator from Iowa criticized me for having a double \nstandard. If I recall correctly, he said, I believe, I should look in \nthe mirror when I talk about double standards.\n  Also, during last night's debate, several of my Democratic colleagues \nattacked my record on moving Clinton nominees. I heard some of these \nattacks repeated this morning by the Senators from California. This \nsurprised me and it very much disappointed me since I worked hard to \nget not only Judge Paez but also Marsha Berzon, now Judge Berzon, \nconfirmed, despite the opposition to their nominations, and there was \nserious opposition. That is one reason it took so long for Judge Paez, \nand there were some very serious allegations. But I was able to fight \nthrough those, and I can guarantee this body that neither of those \njudges would have gone through had it not been for my work.\n  I might add, neither would have a whole bunch of the 377 Clinton \njudges who did get through--the second highest total of confirmed \njudges in the history of the country--had it not been for what I was \ntrying to do to help my colleagues on the other side.\n  I understand my dear friend from Iowa is very bitter about what \nhappened to one of his judicial nominees. I do not blame him for that. \nHe has always been a friend. I am disappointed that he would attack me \non the floor and accuse me of a double standard because he knows \nbetter, and if he does not know better, he ought to know better.\n  I was unable to get his nominee through for a variety of reasons. I \ndo not want to go into them here. I feel badly because of that. I \npersonally liked his nominee, but there were things I was able to do as \nchairman and there were things I was unable to do. The one point nobody \ncan rebut is that President Clinton was treated very fairly in getting \nthe second highest total of Federal judges through in the history of \nthe country of any President. President Reagan got 382 judges through, \n5 more than President Clinton. With regard to those 382 judges, \nPresident Reagan had 6 years of a Republican--his own party--Senate to \nhelp him.\n  President Clinton had 6 years of the Republican Party in charge of \nthe Judiciary Committee, and I was chairman during those 6 years.\n  I think he would be the first to say that I helped him, or he would \nbe a baldfaced liar. I know he is not that. So I would presume that he \nwould be willing to admit, as a decent honorable person, that Senator \nHatch worked closely with him in trying to get those 377 judges \nthrough.\n  Unfortunately, I was not able to get some through some nominees about \nwhich some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle feel very \nbitter. I apologize to them. I feel badly about that because there are \nthings I could do and things I just could not do. There were a lot of \nthings people did not think I could do that I did do. I am not perfect \nany more than anybody else, but I can say this: I do not think any \nother Senator could have gotten done what I got done with regard to \nfairness for the Clinton nominees.\n\n  In contrast, I do not think what is happening to President Bush's \nnominees is fair at all. In fact, here we are in a filibuster for the \nfirst time in history against a Hispanic judge who has risen to the top \nof his profession, even though he has a disability. That bothers me a \nlot, to be honest with you.\n  I did work hard to get Judge Paez and Judge Berzon through and \nconfirmed, despite the opposition to their nominations, which \nopposition was not without merit. There were some legitimate concerns \non the part of some of the Senators on this side of the floor.\n  The fact remains that I lobbied for cloture on those two nominees, \nand\n\n[[Page S2407]]\n\nthey were afforded an up-or-down vote, something Miguel Estrada is not \nbeing afforded. They were afforded an up-or-down vote as a result of my \nefforts. They were both confirmed and both sit today on the Ninth \nCircuit Court of Appeals, a very prestigious circuit court.\n  Let me say this. I will stay here all day and all night, if I have \nto, to defend my record on Clinton judges because it is very unfair for \nanybody who looks at the record to say I personally did not treat him \nwell.\n  With regard to my friend from Iowa, I am disappointed he would attack \nme on the floor of the Senate, but I will say to him, I understand his \nfeelings, his very deep feelings, and he felt very bitter that his \nnominee did not get through, a personal friend and somebody whom I \npersonally liked.\n  With my Democratic friends complaining so vociferously about the \nRepublican treatment of Clinton nominees, which is totally unjustified, \nin my opinion, it leads me to believe that this shabby treatment of \nMiguel Estrada is driven in large part by a Democratic goal of \nretribution. That is all we heard last night in the questions from the \nDemocratic side: Why didn't you do this? Why didn't you do that?\n  If that is the way we play the game, my gosh, I can give 100 cases \nwhere this side ought to have some retribution against them. I, \nfrankly, do not believe in that. Call it tit for tat if you want to, \ncall it payback, call it what you will, but I, for one, am becoming \nmore and more convinced with each Democrat who takes the floor to \ncomplain about the Republican treatment of Clinton nominees that their \nopposition to Miguel Estrada is more about revenge than it is about Mr. \nEstrada. That bothers me a lot, to be frank.\n  Mr. President, I also understand the distinguished Senator from Iowa \nsaid that people who know Mr. Estrada have called him a right-wing \nkook. I do not know anybody who has called him a right-wing kook, not \nanybody on the face of the Earth. The only persons who would do that \nare those who act irresponsibly, and I have not even heard any \nirresponsible people do that. So there is little or no reason for \nanybody on the floor of this Senate to demean Miguel Estrada, and that \nis what this debate has devolved to, and it bothers me.\n  I caution my colleague from Iowa to respect other people. We all make \nmistakes, and we all say things that perhaps we should not say, and I \nwill treat it that way this one time. But I do not want ever again to \nhear anybody on this floor call Miguel Estrada a right-wing kook or any \nother nomination by President Bush, any more than we should have called \nsome of the far-left judges who were nominated by President Clinton \nleft-wing kooks.\n  We never did that, or at least I do not ever recall doing that. I \ncertainly did not, and I do not recall anybody else doing it on our \nside.\n  I just wonder who those mystery people are who called Mr. Estrada a \nright-wing kook. The only person I know of who has gone on record \nsaying anything negative about Mr. Estrada, out of all the persons who \nhave worked with him, is Mr. Bender, who has been more than, I think, \nrebutted, both in committee and on this floor, by his own performance \nreviews of Miguel Estrada that could not have been more glowing. And \nthen when he has a chance to say something nasty because Miguel Estrada \nis now nominated to the circuit court of appeals, he chooses to do so. \nIt is beneath the dignity of a law professor to do that, especially \nafter giving those glowing performance reviews, even though he says \neverybody got those. Everybody knows that is not true.\n\n  If it is true, then it is a sad commentary for our Government. But \nthen again, even though he admits everybody got those glowing \nperformance reviews, he claims the reason for that is because these are \nthe best lawyers in the country. Reading between the lines of his \nletter, that is what he basically said. That is as much as saying \nMiguel Estrada is one of the best lawyers in the country.\n  How can he be so inconsistent? He is the only one I know, and even \nhe, as low as his comments are, did not call Miguel Estrada a ``right-\nwing kook.''\n  He has no credibility. I am just sorry in some ways for the law \nstudents who have to take his classes. I would prefer law professors--I \ndo not care if they are liberal or conservative. Most of them are \nliberal, but I would prefer them to be honest people. I prefer them to \nhave some dignity about their comments. I prefer them to be decent \npeople teaching our young adults.\n  It is a pathetic thing that almost every law school in this country \nhas a whole raft of left-wing professors who, if they had to, probably \ncould not make a living at the practice of law. Maybe they could make a \nliving, but they could not stand the rigors and the difficulties of \npracticing law. It is a lot easier to teach two classes a week and \npontificate from their high perches as liberal law professors to the \ndetriment of some of these law students. It is a pathetic thing. \nAnybody who has gone to law school knows how far left an awful lot of \nthose professors are.\n  Are they bad people because they are far left? No. Some of them are \nterrific teachers and terrific people. Most of them are honest, which \nis something I cannot say for Mr. Bender with the way he has approached \nthis thing.\n  I remind my friend from Iowa that we have a standard in the Senate \nagainst relying on anonymous allegations, even though I have seen \npeople on that side bring up anonymous allegations where Mr. Estrada \ncould not even confront those making the allegations. That is just \nhitting below the belt. Senator Biden made it clear that should never \nhappen, and yet it has happened in this Chamber and it has happened in \ncommittee. I, for one, am fed up with that kind of inappropriate \nbehavior by Senators. It is beneath the dignity of these Senators to do \nsomething like that. Senator Biden's policy was: if they are not \nwilling to face the person they are accusing, then they are not worthy \nof being listened to. I agree with him, and I intend to stick to that \nvery same policy.\n  I am going to forget these derogatory comments by the distinguished \nSenator from Iowa. I have never held a grudge. It is one of my \nweaknesses as a Senator. I just plain cannot hold a grudge against my \ncolleagues. I have had some of my colleagues come up to me and say, \nboy, you ought to have a grudge against that guy. I just cannot do it.\n  Personally, I love everybody in this body. And I think everybody \nknows that. It is against everything I believe to hold a grudge. So I \nam not going to do that and I am going to forget what was said today, \nbut I do not want it ever said again. Nor do I want to have some stupid \nstaffer putting words in the mouth of another Senator. That happens \nevery once in a while. We should not allow staffers, no matter how \nbright they are or how stupid they are, to cause us to do things that \nare inappropriate on the floor of the Senate and to make \naccusations that are not justified against somebody who worked his guts \nout to try and help President Clinton get his judges through, because I \nbelieve the President of the United States has a right to have his \njudges voted on up or down.\n\n  I have made that clear throughout my tenure as chairman, and \neverybody knows it. I have had countless Democrat Senators say they \nknow I am not responsible for some of the problems that happened. Then \nagain how many are responsible over on my side, because 377 Clinton \njudges went through?\n  We were the opposition party putting them through. And they are \ncomplaining? We are in the second month of a brand new session of \nCongress and we cannot even get the first circuit court of appeals \nnominee, the first Hispanic nominated to the Circuit Court of Appeals \nfor the District of Columbia, we cannot even get him a vote up or down \nbecause for the first time in history a true filibuster is being \nconducted against this Hispanic nominee. Now, that is a real double \nstandard, not the one the distinguished Senator from Iowa is talking \nabout.\n  People get emotional sometimes. I may be a little bit myself right \nnow. I think I am somewhat justified under the circumstances, and I \nmake allowances for that. I hope my colleagues will make allowances for \nme right now.\n  I keep hearing that Miguel Estrada has no record. That is a slander. \nAnd for those who have written it, it is a libel. The Judiciary \nCommittee has confirmed numerous Clinton court nominees who, like \nMiguel Estrada, had no prior judicial experience. What a ridiculous \nargument, that a person\n\n[[Page S2408]]\n\nshould not be on the bench because he has no prior judicial experience. \nWhere would all those Clinton judges be? They would not be on the bench \ntoday if we had that as a rule, and neither would many of the top \nSupreme Court Justices in history, including Thurgood Marshall, whom \nnobody in this body would be against today--bless his departed soul. \nHe, of course, had no prior judicial experience when he was nominated \nto the federal appellate bench.\n  A number of Clinton nominees worked in the Justice Department or \nother branches of the Federal Government, like Miguel Estrada, but \nSenate Democrats made no demands for their internal memoranda or \nprivileged work product and, I might add, neither did we Republicans. \nWe did not make those demands. We knew that would be a red herring to \nslow down the nominee.\n  We know this is a fishing expedition, and nobody in their right mind \nwho understands government, who understands the separation of powers, \nwho understands privilege, and who understands the right of the \nSolicitor General's Office to keep its own memoranda of recommendations \non appeals, on certiorari, and on amicus briefs confidential would make \nthis demand. It is one of the most ridiculous assertions I have seen, \nand yet that is the basis on which they are hanging this filibuster. \nThere is nobody in any administration who would allow the Senate to \nmuddle around and make public and politicize legal memoranda and \nrecommendations, in those three areas at least--in other areas as well, \nbut especially those three areas--appeal, certiorari, and amicus curiae \nrecommendations.\n  Democrats are saying Miguel Estrada has no judicial experience, and \ntherefore he should not be on the bench. What about Merrick Garland? I \npersonally pushed Merrick Garland through. There were those who did not \nwant to push him through, but before the end they all realized he was \nan exceptional man, a very good person, no more than Miguel Estrada is, \nbut pretty darn exceptional, and he still is. He is a good judge. He \nwas confirmed as a judge for the DC Circuit in 1997. He had never been \na judge before. He had held several positions in the Department of \nJustice. Like Mr. Estrada, he was a partner in a prestigious DC law \nfirm. But did anyone seek confidential memoranda from his time at the \nJustice Department? Absolutely not. We would not have stooped that low. \nTo use it as a red herring so they could justify a filibuster, that is \neven stooping lower.\n  William Bryson is another one who was confirmed as a judge on the \nFederal Circuit in 1994. He had never been a judge. He held several \npositions at the Department of Justice and was an associate at a \nprestigious firm in town. Senate Democrats never asked for the \nconfidential memoranda he wrote during his time at Justice. The list \ngoes on.\n  Blane Michael was confirmed as a judge on the Fourth Circuit in 1993, \nhis first judgeship, never having been a judge before. Why is it that \nhe can be a judge and we should work to get him on the bench but Miguel \nEstrada should not be a judge because he had no prior judicial \nexperience? Well, neither did Blane Michael, but he is sitting on the \nFourth Circuit Court of Appeals, his first judgeship. He had been a \nFederal district court clerk and served as a Federal prosecutor in New \nYork and West Virginia before becoming a partner in a law firm. He had \nvirtually no published writings, just like Miguel Estrada. Again, \nhowever, no one tried to gain his confidential privileged memoranda \nfrom his time as a Federal prosecutor before confirming him, and we \nwould not.\n  Arthur Gajarsa was confirmed to the Federal Circuit in 1997. He was a \nclerk to a Federal district judge, then worked as an in-house counsel \nat an insurance company and later as a special counsel at the \nDepartment of Interior before joining a law firm. Did Democrats demand \nhis internal memoranda? After all, he, like everyone else mentioned, \nhad never been a judge. But, no, he was confirmed like the rest without \nanyone reviewing his confidential work product.\n\n  Then there is Eric Clay, confirmed to the Sixth Circuit in 1997. He \nnever had been a judge before. He was a law clerk to a Federal district \ncourt judge, and worked in a law firm. What did we know about him that \nwe do not know about Mr. Estrada? Absolutely nothing. We did not seek \nhis confidential memoranda. We confirmed him anyway. We did what was \nright.\n  Another was John Kelly, whom we confirmed for the Eighth Circuit in \n1998, yet another Clinton nominee to the circuit court who had never \nbeen a judge. He had worked in the Office of General Counsel for the \nSecretary of the Air Force before going into private practice. But \nRepublicans never sought his internal memoranda, and he had very few \npublished writings.\n  What about Sid Thomas? He was confirmed to the Ninth Circuit Court of \nAppeals in 1996 and had never been a judge. In fact, he had not even \nhad a clerkship. He also had very few published writings. Democrats, \nhowever, did not cry out about his lack of a record. The entire \ntranscript of his hearings takes up less than 2 pages in the Record. \nWhy is it that he was treated differently than Miguel Estrada? I \nsuspect it is because we gave President Clinton's nominees the benefit \nof the doubt in almost all cases. But this crew on the other side is \nnot giving this President the same fair treatment that we gave to \nPresident Clinton.\n  I could go on and on but I think I made the case. Democrats opposing \nMiguel Estrada consistently failed to seek internal memoranda for \nClinton nominees who had no prior judicial experience and little in the \nway of publications. The Democrats' claim that they have to do so now \nfor Miguel Estrada simply does not hold water.\n  Now, naturally, I guess they wouldn't want to get internal memoranda \nto use against their own president's nominees. They wouldn't want to go \non a fishing expedition that might hurt their own nominees, but neither \ndid we. Now why are we using this red herring to justify a filibuster \nagainst one of the finest nominees I have seen in 27 years on the \nSenate Judiciary Committee--Miguel Estrada?\n  Let me address, once again, the Democrat demand to hold Mr. Estrada's \nnomination hostage for confidential internal memoranda. The Department \nof Justice historically has not disclosed confidential, deliberative \ndocuments from career lawyers in the Solicitor General's Office in \nconnection with a judicial nomination. The Senate historically has not \neven asked the Department to do so.\n  My Democratic colleagues are creating a new double standard that \napplies only to the nomination of Miguel Estrada. A double standard, \nwhy is that? I ask the people out there who are watching C-SPAN, why is \nit that all of a sudden they are asking for all these things from the \nonly Hispanic nominee in the history of the Circuit Court of Appeals \nfor the District of Columbia? I think everyone out there must know by \nnow. I don't think I even have to spell it out, but maybe I should \nspell it out a little bit.\n  Every living former Solicitor General has denounced the Democrats' \ndemands. Every one of them, four of whom are eminent Democrat former \nSolicitors General. I have said this before but I think it is worth \nrepeating. That letter was signed by Democrats Seth Waxman, Clinton's \nSolicitor General; Walter Dellinger, one of Clinton's top people in the \nWhite House; Drew Days, and Archibald Cox; and by Republicans Ken \nStarr, Charles Fried, and Robert Bork.\n  All seven have said, in essence, that this is ridiculous, that the \nJustice Department should not turn over confidential recommendations on \nappeals, certiorari petitions, and amicus curiae petitions.\n  The Solicitors General explained that the frank exchange of ideas on \nwhich their office depends ``simply cannot take place if attorneys have \nreason to fear their private recommendations are not private at all but \nvulnerable to public disclosure.''\n  The letter concludes that:\n\n       [A]ny attempt to intrude into the Office's highly \n     privileged deliberations would come at a cost of the \n     Solicitor General's ability to defend vigorously the United \n     States' litigation interests--a cost that also would be borne \n     by Congress itself.\n  Now, longstanding historical practice confirms that deliberative \nmemoranda are off limits during confirmation hearings. Since the Carter \nadministration, the Senate has confirmed former Justice Department \nemployees--even those with no prior judicial experience, as I have \nalready explained--without demanding to see their confidential\n\n[[Page S2409]]\n\nmemoranda. It should not adopt a new double standard for Mr. Estrada's \nnomination.\n  Since 1997, the Senate has approved 67 appellate nominees who \npreviously worked at the Justice Department, including 38 with no prior \njudicial experience. The Department did not disclose deliberative \nmemoranda for any of those nominations. In fact, the Senate did not \neven request such documents. Seven of the 67 were in the same position \nas Mr. Estrada. They had worked for the Solicitor General and had not \nbeen judges previously. These seven nominees were nominated by \nPresidents of both parties and were confirmed by Senates controlled by \nboth parties. Again, the Justice Department did not disclose \ndeliberative memoranda in any of these nominations. The Senate did not \neven request such a disclosure for good reason, because we knew it was \nimproper.\n  None of the so-called disclosures cited by the Democrats are \nprecedent for the sweeping demands they are making regarding Mr. \nEstrada. In fact, only two of their purported ``precedents'' have even \ninvolved lawyers who worked in the Solicitor General's Office. And the \nDemocrats' examples did not involve turning over what the then-chairman \nof the committee, Senator Leahy of Vermont, demanded--amicus, \ncertiorari, and appeal recommendations.\n  Let me address some of the specific examples my Democratic colleagues \nhave represented as pressing for their demand. One is Frank \nEasterbrook, who is a judge on the Seventh Circuit. The Democrats' mere \npossession of a single memoranda, a 2-page amicus recommendation that \nMr. Easterbrook wrote as an Assistant to the Solicitor General, does \nnot suggest that the Justice Department waived any privileges or \nauthorized it to be disclosed. The official record of the Easterbrook \nconfirmation hearing contains no references to this document.\n  After comprehensively reviewing its files, the Justice Department \nconcluded that it never authorized the release of the documents. It was \nprobably leaked by some Democrat in the Justice Department. That makes \nit wrong. Yet it is being used as an example on the floor.\n  Last fall I sent a letter to Senator Schumer, then to Senator Leahy, \nspecifically asking for information about how the Democrats obtained \nthis memorandum. To this day I have received absolutely no response to \nmy question. I think there is good reason for that--because the \ndocument should never have been leaked to begin with.\n  This single document provides no precedent for the Democrats' \nsweeping request for every document Mr. Estrada ever prepared, which is \nwhat they have asked.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letters I wrote to \nSenator Schumer of New York and Senator Leahy of Vermont, inquiring \nabout the source of the Easterbrook memos, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 1, 2002.\n     Hon. Charles E. Schumer,\n     U.S. Senate, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Schumer: Thank you for chairing last \n     Thursday's hearing on the nomination of Miguel Estrada to the \n     United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia \n     Circuit. I write to seek your clarification on a matter which \n     you raised at the hearing.\n       You reiterated your belief that the Department of Justice \n     should turn over certain appeal, certiorari and amicus \n     recommendations that Mr. Estrada authored when he served as \n     an Assistant to the Solicitor General. As precedent for this \n     request, you noted that during the nomination of Judge Frank \n     Easterbrook to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, similar \n     memos were turned over to the Committee. You produced those \n     documents and placed them into the hearing record. When \n     Republican staff requested copies of the documents, only one \n     of the three documents we received appeared to pertain to \n     Judge Easterbrook. That document consists of a two-page \n     memorandum referencing another memorandum prepared by someone \n     else.\n       At the hearing, you did not explain whether the Committee \n     had ever formally requested this document, or the other two \n     documents, from the Department of Justice, or whether the \n     Department of Justice consented to their disclosure. The \n     written record of Judge Easterbrook's hearing contains no \n     such documents, or even a mention of them. So that the record \n     of Mr. Estrada's hearing is as complete as possible, please \n     advise whether you have any information that the Committee \n     requested these documents from the Department of Justice and \n     whether the Department consented to their disclosure to the \n     Committee. If the documents were neither requested of nor \n     produced by the Department of Justice, please indicate the \n     manner in which the Committee came to possess them.\n       Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. I look \n     forward to your response.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Ranking Republican Member.\n                                  ____\n\n                                             United States Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 10, 2002.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy: On October 1, I sent a letter to \n     Senator Schumer seeking clarification of questions about \n     certain documents that he submitted for the record at Miguel \n     Estrada's confirmation hearing. These documents consisted of \n     memoranda that Senator Schumer stated were provided to the \n     Committee by the Department of Justice during the nomination \n     of Judge Frank Easterbrook to the Seventh Circuit. Senator \n     Schumer cited these documents as precedent for your request \n     that the Department release to the Committee appeal, \n     certiorari and amicus recommendations that Mr. Estrada \n     authored when he served as an Assistant to the Solicitor \n     General.\n       When Republican staff requested copies of these documents, \n     however, only one of the three documents provided appeared to \n     pertain to Judge Easterbrook. That document consists of a \n     two-page memorandum referencing another memorandum prepared \n     by someone else. The written record of Judge Easterbrook's \n     hearing contains none of the three documents, or even a \n     reference to them.\n       Enclosed is a copy of my letter to Senator Schumer, which \n     seeks clarification of whether the Committee requested these \n     documents from the Department of Justice in connection with \n     Judge Easterbrook's confirmation and whether the Department \n     consented to their disclosure to the Committee. It also asks \n     for an explanation of the manner in which the Committee came \n     to possess the documents in the event that they were neither \n     requested of nor produced by the Department of Justice.\n       Yesterday, Senator Schumer's office advised my staff that \n     the full Committee provided him with the documents at issue \n     and, for this reason, he is deferring to you for a response \n     to my letter. I look forward to hearing from you, \n     particularly in light of the October 8 letter of Assistant \n     Attorney General Dan Bryant, which stated the Department's \n     conclusion that it did not authorize the release of the \n     Easterbrook memorandum.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Orrin G. Hatch,\n                                        Ranking Republican Member.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Let's take a closer look at another one of the Democrats' \nalleged examples. William Rehnquist, the current Chief Justice, during \nhis hearings to be Associate Justice, refused to reveal the private \nadvice he had given to other Justice Department officials while he was \nAssistant Attorney General for Legal Counsel.\n  He stated:\n\n       [I]nsofar as I may have been asked for advice in the \n     process of making administration policy decisions upon which \n     the administration has not taken a public position, there, I \n     think, the lawyer-client privilege very definitely obtains.\n\n  By the way, he was confirmed as a Justice on the Supreme Court.\n  Furthermore, on November 5, 1971, the Attorney General specifically \nrefused to waive the attorney-client privilege after a Senator asked \nhim to do so, stating:\n\n       I can well appreciate your personal, intense interest in \n     probing into all aspects of Mr. Rehnquist's work while at the \n     Department of Justice. I am sure you appreciate, however, \n     that it is essential to the fulfillment of my duties and \n     obligations that I have the candid advice and opinions of all \n     members of the Department. Further, I am sure you realize \n     that if I should consent to your request or other requests to \n     inquire into the basis and background of advice and opinions \n     that I receive from the members of my staff, it would be \n     difficult to obtain the necessary free exchange of ideas and \n     thoughts so essential to the proper and judicious discharge \n     of my duties.\n  The Rehnquist example is irrelevant for the additional reason that \nnone of the information sought related to amicus, certiorari, and \nappeal recommendations. Indeed, Chief Justice Rehnquist never served in \nthe Solicitor General's Office.\n  Let's look at a third example that my Democratic friends claim \njustifies the release of confidential Solicitor General Office memos--\nBenjamin Civiletti. During his 1979 confirmation hearings to be \nAttorney General--and I\n\n[[Page S2410]]\n\nwas there in the Senate Judiciary Committee at the time--the Senate did \nnot request materials that he had prepared previously as a Department \nof Justice official. Rather, it simply sought assurances that Civiletti \nwould cooperate with the Senate's oversight of the Justice Department \nin the future. Mr. Civiletti never specified which documents he would \nbe willing to turn over or which documents would be privileged.\n  During his 1978 hearings to be Deputy Attorney General, the Senate \nobtained documents related to allegations that Mr. Civiletti had \ninterfered with an investigation of an alleged kickback scheme \ninvolving Members of Congress. The documents related to specific \ncharges of misconduct. Unlike during Mr. Civiletti's confirmation, \nthere have been no allegations that Mr. Estrada engaged in any improper \nbehavior or otherwise failed to discharge his duties.\n  As I recall it, Mr. Civiletti was not found to be wanting in that \narea either. None of the Civiletti materials were amicus, certiorari, \nor appeal recommendations. Indeed, Mr. Civiletti never served in the \nSolicitor General's Office.\n  Now let's turn to Brad Reynolds. The Senate sought and received \nmaterials in the course of pursuing specific allegations that Mr. \nReynolds, while Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, failed to \nenforce the Voting Rights Act and the Civil Rights Act. As with Mr. \nCiviletti, the Department's disclosure was limited to specific cases of \nalleged misconduct. There have been no allegations that Mr. Estrada \nengaged in any improper behavior or failed to discharge his duties \nwhile working at the Solicitor General's Office. Significantly, \nalthough Mr. Reynolds had previously served as assistant to the \nSolicitor General, and it was a very-hard fought confirmation, the \nSenate never suggested that his appeal, certiorari, or amicus \nrecommendations should be divulged--never. Nobody would have stooped to \nthat level at the time.\n  Another alleged example that our friends have brought up is Jeffrey \nHolmstead. In 2001, the Senate requested 41 files that Mr. Holmstead \ncreated during his service as Associate Counsel to the first President \nBush. The White House declined. After Mr. Holmstead's hearing, the \nSenate, based on its particularized concerns about one specific \nsubject, requested documents related only to that matter. Because of \nthe specificity of the Senate's concerns, the White House accommodated \nthe committee by permitting review of documents related to that one \nsubject matter while expressly preserving all privileges. Mr. Holmstead \nis no precedent for the current set of sweeping requests for every \nappeal, certiorari, or amicus recommendation that Estrada prepared \nduring his years in the Solicitor General's Office.\n  The criticism that Miguel Estrada is refusing to provide the Senate \nwith insight into his personal views does create a double standard. My \nDemocratic colleagues did not require nominees of President Clinton to \nanswer questions of this sort. In fact, many Clinton circuit court \nnominees refused to answer such questions. President Clinton's appeals \ncourt nominees routinely testified as to their judicial approach \nwithout discussing specific issues or cases that could come before them \nas a judge. A few examples illustrate the point.\n  Each of the nominees I am talking about was confirmed to one of the \ncircuit courts of appeals.\n  First we have Merrick Garland. In the nomination of Merrick Garland \nto the DC Circuit, Senator Specter asked him:\n\n       Do you favor, as a personal matter, capital punishment?\n\n  Judge Garland replied only that he would follow Supreme Court \nprecedent:\n\n       This is really a matter of settled law now. The Court has \n     held that capital punishment is constitutional and lower \n     courts are to follow that rule.\n\n  Senator Specter also asked him about his views of the independent \ncounsel statute's constitutionality, and Judge Garland responded:\n\n       Well, that, too, the Supreme Court in Morrison v. Olsen \n     upheld as constitutional, and, of course, I would follow that \n     ruling.\n\n  Another example is Judith Rogers. In the hearings on Judge Rogers' \nnomination to the DC Circuit, she was asked by Senator Cohen about the \ndebate over the evolving Constitution. Judge Rogers responded:\n\n       My obligation as an appellate judge is to apply precedent. \n     Some of the debates which I have heard and to which I think \n     you may be alluding are interesting, but as an appellate \n     judge, my obligation is to apply precedent. And so the \n     interpretations of the Constitution by the U.S. Supreme Court \n     would be binding on me.\n\n  My gosh, where is that any different from Miguel Estrada's answers? \nThey are the same. Why the double standard? Why are we now demanding of \nMiguel Estrada something we didn't demand of the Clinton nominees?\n  She then was asked how she would rule in the absence of precedent and \nresponded this way:\n\n       When I was getting my master's in judicial process at the \n     University of Virginia Law School, one of the points \n     emphasized was the growth of our common law system based on \n     the English common law judge system. And my opinions, I think \n     if you look at them, reflect that where I am presented with a \n     question of first impression, that I look to the language of \n     whatever provision we are addressing, that I look to the \n     interpretations of other State courts, and it may be \n     necessary, as well, to look to the interpretations suggested \n     by commentators. And within that framework, which I consider \n     to be a discipline, that I would reach a view in a case of \n     first impression.\n\n  Where is that different from Miguel Estrada's answers? Miguel Estrada \nanswered basically the same way.\n  Judge Rogers also was asked her view of mandatory minimums and \nstated:\n\n       I am aware, Senator, of some of the debate on the pros and \n     cons, and certainly before I was a judge I was engaged in \n     comment on them. But as a judge, I have been dealing with \n     them strictly from the point of view of legal challenges to \n     them. I have sat on a case where a mandatory minimum sentence \n     was challenged, and we upheld it.\n\n  Finally, she was asked her view of the three-strikes law and stated:\n\n       As an appellate judge, my obligation is to enforce the laws \n     that Congress passes or, where I am now, that the District of \n     Columbia Council passes.\n\n  Why is there a different standard for Miguel Estrada? Those are the \nsame answers, basically, that Miguel Estrada gave to these similar \ntypes of questions.\n  Let's take another example: Kim Wardlaw. In the hearing on Judge \nWardlaw's nomination to the Ninth Circuit, she was asked about the \nconstitutionality of affirmative action. She stated, in an answer \nsimilar to Miguel Estrada's answer to the same question:\n\n       The Supreme Court has held that racial classifications are \n     unconstitutional unless they are narrowly tailored to meet a \n     compelling governmental interest.\n\n  Why is there a double standard with regard to this Hispanic nominee \nwhen it was not utilized against these other nominees? These answers \nwere perfectly all right and acceptable for these other nominees.\n  Now let's turn to Marsha Berzon and Robert Katzmann. In a hearing on \ntheir nominations to the Ninth and Second Circuits, Senator Smith asked \neach whether legislation to prohibit partial-birth abortion was \nunconstitutional. Judge Katzmann responded as follows:\n\n       I would say that that is an issue that--Senator--that is a \n     very important issue, and that as a judge, I would really \n     have to evaluate that issue in the context of a law that is \n     actually passed, and then in terms of a case or controversy. \n     In terms of adjudication, there are restrictions on judges \n     rendering advisory opinions on particular pieces of \n     legislation in the advance of passage. And then even after \n     passage, I think what a judge has to do is to evaluate the \n     case in the context of a real case or controversy.\n\n  Judge Berzon responded with the following:\n\n       And I essentially agree with that answer. . . . .It would \n     obviously be inappropriate to say anything further on that \n     precisely because the issue might come before a court on \n     which Mr. Katzmann or I could be sitting.\n\n  Why the double standard? Why aren't the answers Mr. Miguel Estrada \ngave given the same credibility as the answers of these two Clinton \njudges? Why is there a double standard? Why is he being treated \ndifferently?\n  I have heard countless colleagues get up over here and complain and \nmoan and groan and try to come up with excuses for their vote against \nMiguel Estrada and for their filibustering for the first time in \nhistory a Hispanic judge, the first ever nominated to the Circuit Court \nof Appeals for the District of Columbia.\n  I have heard a lot of complaining. But there has not been one \nstatement\n\n[[Page S2411]]\n\nof substance. Why is he being treated differently? Why should a \nHispanic judicial nominee be treated differently than all these other \nnon-Hispanic judges? It seems to me that he ought to be treated \nsimilarly, afforded respect. This is a man who has fulfilled the \nAmerican dream as an example to countless Hispanic young people that \nyou can make it in this society. But can a Hispanic who is deemed to be \nnot only a Republican but a conservative--can that type of Hispanic \nmake it? Well, I sure hope so.\n  Now, back to this Berzon and Katzmann matter, I interrupted Senator \nSmith's questioning on partial-birth abortion and noted to Senator \nSmith:\n\n       Well, Senator, if I could interrupt, you have asked some \n     very appropriate and good questions. . . Both of them have \n     said, in my opinion that they are not sure how they would \n     decide the case, and that they wouldn't want to give the \n     opinion that they have now without hearing all the facts and \n     evidence. . . . But they both say that that could likely come \n     before them and that they are going to have to decide it at \n     that time.\n\n  Now, those two Clinton judicial nominees, Judge Berzon and Judge \nKatzmann. Some might say that they provided nonanswers to important \nquestions they were asked. But I think they provided legitimate answers \nfor the important reason that those questions might come before them \nsomeday in the event of their confirmation.\n  Why should Miguel Estrada be treated any differently by my colleagues \non their side when I personally counseled one senator on my side that \nthe answers of these Clinton judges were sufficient?\n  They were appropriate answers that they gave because they shouldn't \nhave been talking about cases that could possibly come before them.\n  Let me go to Judge Maryanne Trump Barry.\n  I am now talking about circuit judges who made it through the system \nwithout any of this rig marole that has surrounded trying to defeat \nMiguel Estrada.\n  In the hearing on Judge Barry's nomination to the Third Circuit, \nSenator Smith asked whether ``an unborn child at any stage of pregnancy \nis a human being.''\n  Senator Smith is not an attorney. But anybody on the committee can \nask any question they want to ask. He asked whether ``an unborn child \nat any stage of pregnancy is a human being.''\n  That was a loaded question--no question about it.\n  Judge Barry responded:\n\n       Casey is the law that I would look at. If I had a personal \n     opinion--and I am not suggesting that I do--it is irrelevant \n     because I must look to the law which binds me.\n\n  My goodness. Why is Miguel Estrada being treated differently than \nJudge Barry, or any of these other circuit court of appeals judges who \nwere not Hispanic? Why is he being treated differently? Why isn't he \naccorded the same respect? Why is he expected to do more? Why is it \nthat it is tough for him? Why is it that my friends on the other side \nof the aisle who claim to be for civil rights and who claim to be for \nequal rights and who claim to be helpers to minorities are treating \nthis man this way?\n  I hope everybody in America is asking that question--because I don't \nthink they can answer it. I have to say that a lot of political things \nare done for political reasons. We are fighting for a Hispanic nominee \nto the circuit court of appeals. And you saw virtually every Republican \nin the Chamber last night fighting for Miguel Estrada.\n  Where were the Democrats? Backbiting, raising false issues, raising \nlousy issues, raising I think sometimes immature issues, raising \nirrelevant issues, raising red-herring issues, treating him totally \ndifferent from the way they wanted their caucasian nominees to be \ntreated.\n  Why is this different? Is it because Mr. Estrada is Hispanic? I don't \nbelieve that. I don't believe my colleagues are prejudiced against \nHispanics. But I believe they don't want a Republican Hispanic to serve \non the Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia no matter \nwho is President, but especially when there is a Republican President. \nI don't think you can conclude anything else.\n  After watching these proceedings and after listening to these \nstatements, where is one point of substance against that nominee? In \nall of this debate, where is it? It isn't there.\n  Why do they think his answers are insufficient when they are \nvirtually identical to their non-Hispanic nominees' answers? Is it \nbecause they are trying to do a better job for the judiciary than the \nRepublicans were trying to do? I don't think so--no better than this \nRepublican was trying to do, I will tell you that. I was in a position \nto do a lot.\n  How about Raymond Fisher? In the hearing on Judge Raymond Fisher's \nnomination to the Ninth Circuit, Senator Sessions asked about Judge \nFisher's own personal views on whether the death penalty was \nconstitutional.\n  He had a right to do that. But Judge Fisher also had a right to \nrespond. He responded:\n\n       My view, Senator, is that, as you indicated, the Supreme \n     Court has ruled that the death penalty is constitutional. As \n     a lower appellate court judge, that is the law that I am \n     governed by. I don't want in my judicial career, should I be \n     fortunate enough to have one, to inject my personal opinions \n     into whether or not to follow the law. I believe that the \n     precedent of the Supreme Court is binding and that is what my \n     function is.\n\n  That is exactly, in essence, the language that Miguel Estrada used. \nYet he is being criticized. Why? Is it because, as some of the Hispanic \nCaucus in the House said, he is just not Hispanic enough; or that he \nhasn't done enough for the Hispanic community? What more can a young \nman do than to rise to the top of his profession as a Hispanic and as \nan example to every young Hispanic in this country--man and woman?\n  They are telling us what a Hispanic has to do to be accepted by the \nDemocratic Hispanic Caucus in the House which is so partisan that they \nare undermining the first Hispanic ever nominated to the Circuit Court \nof Appeals for the District of Columbia. I think they should be \nashamed.\n  As for Congressman Menendez asking me for an apology--is he kidding? \nI think the apology is owed to the whole Hispanic community by the \nDemocrat Hispanic Caucus over in the House which is undermining every \nHispanic judicial nominee in the future, if they are saying--if they \ndid, if I recall it correctly--because he has no judicial experience he \nshould not have the privilege of sitting on the Circuit Court of \nAppeals for the District of Columbia.\n  I have previously gone through more than two dozen Clinton nominees \nwho had no prior judicial experience and who are now sitting on the \ncircuit court of appeals.\n  In the joint hearing on Judge Fisher and Judge Barry, Senator Smith \nasked whether the nominees would have believed that there was a \nconstitutional right to abortion without the Roe v. Wade precedent.\n  This is very similar to questions that Senator Schumer of New York \nasked certain nominees.\n  But I interrupted Senator Smith to say--to my own colleague on my own \nside, one of my close friends in the Senate--as chairman, I said: \n``That is not a fair question to these two nominees because regardless \nof what happened pre-1973, they have to abide by what has happened \npost-1973 and the current precedents that the Supreme Court has.''\n  Think about that. I basically told my own colleague that he was out \nof line in asking that question, even though he had a right to do it.\n  Everybody knows I am pro-life. Nobody doubts that. I have stood up \nfor that, and I will always stand up for it because it is the right \nthing to do. It is the moral, upright thing to do as well. To have 39 \nmillion abortions in this society and millions more around the world \nprimarily because of Roe v. Wade is something that every American ought \nto be analyzing and asking, What is going on here?\n  When we find that so many on the other side of the aisle support even \npartial-birth abortion where a full-of-life baby capable of being born \noutside of the mother's womb and living is basically killed by a doctor \nby ramming scissors into the back of its skull before that baby is \npulled out so they can suck the brains out--and then say that is not a \nhuman being?\n  I don't see how anybody can stand up with that kind of barbaric \npractice, but it has been done.\n  Every time I think of one of these judges and how well we treated \nthem\n\n[[Page S2412]]\n\nand how fairly we treated them, and then I see the contrast of how they \nare treating Miguel Estrada, I want the American people to know this. \nThis is pure bunk on their side. Where is the substance? Why would they \nbe filibustering for the first time in history and establishing this \ndangerous precedent where both sides can require 60 votes for anybody \nto become a judge in this country? And the Presidents will no longer \ncontrol this process. Presidents will have to succumb to the almighty \nSenate if that becomes the rule.\n  That is what they are playing with over there. It is unbelievable. \nPresidents will no longer control the nomination process in any \nrespect. They will have to do whatever the Senate says.\n  I cannot think of a worse thing that could happen to this country, \nbecause the judiciary is one-third of the separated federal powers in \nthis country.\n  My gosh, let me go to Richard Tallman, since we are going through to \nshow how they treated their nominees a lot differently than they are \ntreating this Hispanic nominee.\n  I hope every Hispanic in this country is listening because it affects \nevery Hispanic in the country, Democrat, Independent, and Republican.\n  Richard Tallman. In followup questions to his hearing on his \nnomination to the Ninth Circuit, Senator Smith asked Judge Tallman \nwhether ``there are any questions that you feel are off limits for a \nSenator to ask?''\n  Judge Tallman's response:\n\n       A Senator may ask any question he or she wishes. Judicial \n     nominees are limited by judicial ethical considerations from \n     answering any question in a manner that would call for an \n     ``advisory opinion'' as the courts have defined that or that \n     in effect would ask a nominee to suggest how he or she would \n     rule on an issue that could foreseeably require his or her \n     attention in a future case or controversy after confirmation.\n\n  Senator Smith also asked Judge Tallman several questions regarding \nhow he would have decided certain Supreme Court cases, including Brown \nv. Board of Education and Roe v. Wade. Judge Tallman's answer to the \nRoe question was as follows. His answer to the other question was the \nsame:\n\n       It is entirely conjectural as to what I would have done \n     without having the opportunity to thoroughly review the \n     record presented on appeal, the briefs and arguments of \n     counsel, and the supporting legal authorities that were \n     applicable at that time. I would note that the Supreme Court \n     has since modified Roe v. Wade, in Planned Parenthood v. \n     Casey.\n\n  Look, that is an answer no different than the answers for which they \nare criticizing Miguel Estrada. Why is that? Why is it they are not \nbeing fair to this Hispanic nominee? Why is it they do not care about \nfairness? Why is it they are not being fair to the nominees of the \nPresident of the United States? Why is it they are not observing the \nSenate practice of not filibustering nominees to the Federal courts of \nthis country? Why is it Miguel Estrada's answers, which were basically \nthe same as these answers, are considered nonanswers when these were \nconsidered substantive answers? Why is there a double standard? I do \nnot understand this. Why is there a double standard?\n  I got off on this because of the comments of the distinguished \nSenator from Iowa that I have set a double standard. I defy him to show \nwhere I have, because I have been fair. Again, I will repeat, the all-\ntime confirmation champion was Ronald Reagan, with 382 confirmed \nFederal judges. That was amazing. Everybody thought that was amazing. \nDemocrats have been mad ever since, that we could have confirmed 382 \nReagan nominees to the Federal bench, almost all of whom have served \nwith distinction in the best interest of this country, working with \nDemocrat judges as well.\n  Reagan had 6 years of a Republican Senate to help him get those 382 \nthrough. President Clinton got virtually the same number, and he had 6 \nyears of an opposition party in control of the Senate. He did not have \n6 years of his own party helping him. He actually had 6 years of an \nopposition party. I was chairman, and he got virtually the same \nnumber--astounding. He was treated fairly.\n  And for anybody to walk on this floor and criticize me because we \nwere unable to get through some of the judges at the end of the session \nis disingenuous. There were much fewer left over at the end of \nPresident Clinton's tenure than there were at the end of Bush 1. We did \nnot complain that there were 54 judges left over at the end of Bush 1 \nand, in essence, only 42 left over at the end of Clinton.\n\n  But I do bitterly resent anybody coming in here and saying I had a \ndouble standard, when I worked so hard, and had to overrule a number of \nmy colleagues--not a big number, but a small number of colleagues--who \nwanted, yes, some of them wanted to filibuster, and I helped to \noverrule that. And they all realize today why they should have never \neven contemplated that. And this has helped to bring it into even \ngreater focus.\n  I am calling on my colleagues on the other side to bring it into \nfocus and realize this is dangerous stuff they are playing with here. \nIt is dangerous. It could cost this country and all future Presidents \ncontrol of the nominations process.\n  Now, they do not control it completely. We have an obligation, too. \nOur obligation is to advise and consent. Now, advise and consent does \nnot mean advise and filibuster. It does not mean advise and obstruct. \nIt does not mean advise and help some people but treat others with a \ndifferent standard, like Miguel Estrada is being treated here. It does \nnot mean that. And advise and consent does not mean advise and \nfilibuster, to go back to that point.\n  If they succeed in this, they will have established, I believe, an \nunconstitutional precedent I am not sure we can get rid of afterwards. \nAnd I believe you are talking about upwards of 60 votes needed for \nevery future judge of any quality and, I have to say, taking away a \ngreat deal of the President's power to nominate these judges, to select \nthese judges, because no President would be able to have the right to \nselect judges, not without the absolute blessing of the Senators. It is \nalmost that bad now anyway.\n  Well, Mr. President, I think I have more than made a case that there \nis a double standard here. I think I have more than made the case that \na lot of these Democrat judges have been treated differently from the \nway Miguel Estrada is being treated, and that is even not considering \nthe filibuster.\n  When you consider the filibuster, that is like throwing nuclear waste \nall over the judiciary process, because that really is going to cause \nproblems around here like we have never even dreamed of before.\n  It is inadvisable, it is wrong, it is constitutionally unsound. And \nit is a travesty. And it is--to use a very important word--unfair, \nunfair to Miguel Estrada, unfair to the President, who has nominated \nhim, unfair to this process, unfair to Republicans on this side who \ntreated Clinton judges fairly and well. It is unfair to our procedures \naround here.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last night, White House Counsel Alberto \nGonzales responded to the letter that Senator Daschle and I sent to the \nPresident this week, renewing the request that the Judiciary Committee \nmade for the Justice Department work records of Mr. Estrada. This is a \nrequest that the Judiciary Committee first made nearly a year ago, and \nit is a request that has been made repeatedly since then.\n  I regret that, at this point, the White House remains recalcitrant \nand continues to stand in the way of a solution to this impasse.\n  For an administration that engages in lawyer-bashing at every turn, \nthere is some irony in the fact that the White House has put a bevy of \nlawyers to work to compose a lawyer's brief rather than a \nstraightforward response to Senator Daschle's good-faith effort to \nresolve this standoff.\n  But the letter from Mr. Gonzales does provide some new information \nthat is quite interesting in one respect, at least. Buried within the \n15-page letter is a new admission that the Justice Department and \nSenate Republicans had previously refused to make. The administration \nhas finally acknowledged that there is precedent for providing the very \ntypes of documents the Judiciary Committee requested almost a year ago \nin connection with Mr. Estrada's nomination.\n  Interestingly, the administration in this letter makes no claim of \nlegal privilege or executive privilege to withhold these documents from \nthe\n\n[[Page S2413]]\n\nSenate. Instead, the White House Counsel's Office insists on \nsubstituting its judgment for the Senate's and tells the Senate that we \nalready have sufficient information about this nominee.\n  We on this side of the aisle are making the simple request that \njudicial nominees for these lifetime positions fully and forthrightly \nanswer legitimate questions so the Senate can make informed decisions. \nEven more important than this or any other nomination itself is the \nstraightforward principle that no nominee should be rewarded with a \nlifetime appointment to the second highest court in the land for \nstonewalling the Senate and the American people. Getting a lifetime \npost on the Federal courts is a privilege, not a right.\n  I have voted for many, many judges whose judicial philosophy I \ndisagreed with, but at least I knew what their judicial philosophies \nwere. In fact the Democratic Senate confirmed 100 of President Bush's \njudicial nominees by the end of last year, and I voted for nearly all \nof them. The same can be said for each and every Senator on this side \nof the aisle.\n  I hope that after getting this letter off its chest, the \nadministration will now begin to work with us. If they did we could end \nthe stalemate they have created.\n  Those of us who want to resolve this in a way that upholds the \nprinciple of the Senate being able to make an informed judgment on this \nand on any judicial nominees welcomed the constructive discussion on \nthe floor yesterday that Senator Bennett initiated, about the potential \nfor reaching agreement on making the Justice Department documents \navailable to the Senate. I hope this is a signal that there is at least \na chance that the administration will yet comply with our request, so \nthat this standoff can be resolved.\n  With the White House, the House and the Senate now all controlled by \none party, we are already seeing an erosion of accountability. \nDemocratic members of the Senate are standing up for the Senate's \nconstitutional role in the installation of judges on the Federal \ncourts.\n  Beyond the difficulties we have encountered in obtaining \nstraightforward answers from Mr. Estrada and in obtaining his work \ndocuments, in recent weeks the overall process of evaluating judicial \ncandidates has begun to resemble a conveyor belt for rubber stamping \nnominees. The conveyor belt has been going faster and faster--so fast \nthat the nominations have begun piling up at the end of the belt. We \nshould be trying to minimize and not maximize those kinds of ``I Love \nLucy'' moments. We have had an unprecedented hearing in which not one \nbut three controversial circuit court nominees were considered, en \nbloc.\n  In the 107th Congress, the Democratic Senate confirmed 100 of \nPresident Bush's nominees, and we did so in an orderly process and with \na steady pace of hearings every single month that greatly improved on \nthe slow and halting pace set by the previous Republican Senate in the \nhandling of President Clinton's judicial nominees. The choice does not \nhave to be between the slow pace of the earlier Republican Senate in \nthe handling of President Clinton's nominees and the frenetic pace of \nthe new Republican Senate in the handling of President Bush's nominees. \nWe can and should find a responsible pace somewhere between those \nextremes.\n  The court to which Mr. Estrada has been nominated, the Circuit Court \nof Appeals for the District of Columbia, has been called the second \nmost powerful court in the land, and for good reason. This court, in \nparticular, affects every single American in many ways, in its \ndecisions on everything from clean air and water issues to the voting \nrights of Latinos and other minorities to the health and employment \nrights of working men and women.\n  No circuit court in the Nation is more important to Hispanic \nAmericans than the DC Circuit. I commend the Congressional Hispanic \nCaucus for the time, the effort its members have invested and the \ncourage its members have shown in closely examining the record, in \ninterviewing Mr. Estrada, and in offering its judgment about the \nimportance of this nomination for the interests of Hispanic Americans \neverywhere.\n  What kind of cases does this court handle, and what is at stake in \nthe decisions it renders? There is a big hint in a front page story \nthat ran a few days ago in Roll Call, in which leaders on the other \nside of the aisle are reminding lobbyists for big business groups that \nthey have a major stake in who gets on this crucial circuit court.\n  This process starts with the President. With a simple directive to \nthe Justice Department, he can help the Senate resolve this. I was \nencouraged early in his term when the President said he wanted to be a \nuniter and not a divider. Yet he has sent several judicial nominations, \nselected foremost for their ideology, and not for their fairness, that \nhave divided the American people and divided the Senate. And in terms \nof fairness, it also needs to be pointed out that the Republican Senate \nblocked President Clinton's nominees to this very same court.\n  What are we asking for? It is a simple request: We ask only for \nsufficient answers and information so that the Senate can make informed \ndecisions about candidates for lifetime appointments to the Federal \njudiciary.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the Senate has been dealing with some \nimportant matters these days, with a judicial nomination to the second \nhighest court in the country, and shortly to bring up an appropriations \nbill that will determine spending across this country with hundreds of \nbillions of dollars for the rest of this fiscal year.\n  But there is something else going on in this country which is of \noverwhelming importance which really should supersede all of this, and \nthat is the imminent prospect of a war against Iraq.\n  At the same time we are talking about these other matters, this \ncountry is under a condition code orange, the second highest level of \nsecurity we have. Our citizens have been told in the last few days to \ngo out and get duct tape and sheets of plastic and water.\n  Today at the Senate Armed Services Committee hearing, of which I am a \nmember, the Secretary of Defense called the time that we are in now \n``the most dangerous security environment that the world has ever \nknown.'' It is for those reasons I wrote the majority leader and urged \nwe not take a recess as planned next week, that we stay in\n\n[[Page S2414]]\n\nWashington, stay in session, because I think this is a matter of such \nurgency and such paramount importance to our country and to the world \nthat we should be continuing to focus on that matter.\n  The ominous forewarnings of this last couple of days affirm to me \nwhat Robert Kennedy said after the Cuban missile crisis. He said:\n\n       No action is taken against an adversary in a vacuum. The \n     escalation on one side brings a counterresponse. A government \n     of people will fail to understand this only at their great \n     peril.\n\n  For the last 55 years the leaders of this country have understood \nthat principle. They, too, faced dangerous dictators who possessed \nweapons of mass destruction, who headed countries that were hostile to \nthe United States, the former Soviet Union, China, North Korea. But \nthey didn't attack another country to eliminate those threats, even \nthough they persisted, even though we disagreed with those countries, \nwhat their leaders did to their own people, the threats they were \naround the world. The principal reason was we understood the doctrine \nof mutual assured destruction. We understood their destruction against \nthe United States would be an intolerable cost for our destruction of \nthem and for the objectives we might accomplish militarily.\n  I believe these forewarnings we have received the last few days \nshould cause us to ask this administration why would they expect Iraq \nto be any different. If the United States intervenes and begins to \ndestroy that country and its cities, cause civilian casualties, why \nwould we not expect Iraq to retaliate with every destructive force it \nhas available to it within our own borders, against our own cities and \nour own citizens?\n  Why wouldn't we expect Osama bin Laden to do his worst to exploit \nthis situation, to twist facts to be seen by the rest of the world \nother than as they are, but in ways that would be destructive to United \nStates standing around the world and to our own national security now \nand in the days and months ahead?\n  Why does this administration believe it should disregard the lessons \nthat other Presidents, Republican and Democrat, have recognized and \nobserved and proven to be as valid then as they are today? What is \ndifferent about this situation?\n  At the Senate Armed Services Committee hearing this morning I asked \nthe Secretary of Defense his assessment of our ability to protect our \ncitizens from retaliatory attacks against them if we were to invade \nIraq. I asked that question twice. How do you assess, Mr. Secretary, \nour ability to protect our citizens in their homes and their schools \nand our cities from an enemy attack? Neither time did I receive a \ndirect answer to that question. Neither time. I have the highest regard \nfor the Secretary of Defense. He has an enormous responsibility. He \nbrings tremendous experience and ability and a heroic dedication to our \ncountry to this task. But if all this administration can offer the \nAmerican people, when our national security alert is raised to the \nsecond highest level, is duct tape, sheets of plastic and water, there \nis something very seriously wrong, if this administration intends to \nstart a war, not against the most urgent threat to this country, not \nthe threat that endangered us before, attacked us before and endangers \nus now, according to many of their own officials, al-Qaida, Osama bin \nLaden, the tape that was released this week that issues that threat \nagainst us and our citizens once again, not an attack against al-Qaida \nbut against Iraq, against a country that, no question, is ruled by an \nevil man, a dangerous dictator, a man who almost certainly, as the \nSecretary of State has demonstrated, the President in the State of the \nUnion, possesses biological and chemical weapons and has for the last \n12 years, ever since the first President Bush made a strategic decision \nat the conclusion of the gulf war to leave him in power, which may have \nbeen the right decision given the other options that were available.\n\n  Yes, an evil dictator, but one who has been constrained in key \nrespects by active, ongoing efforts of diplomacy with our allies and \ncontainment by international forces by both former President Bush and \nby President Clinton. Contained, constrained, not perfectly, not \neasily, certainly not voluntarily on his part, but effectively, more \neffectively than has been acknowledged in recent months. He is weaker, \naccording to reports I have seen, militarily in most respects than he \nwas before the gulf war. He does, by all accounts that we can obtain, \nnot possess nuclear warhead capabilities at this time, which I agree \nwith the President would be intolerable for this country to permit. He \nhas not attacked his neighbors--not because he wouldn't like to, \nprobably, but because he has not had the capability to do so under \nthese containment policies for the last 12 years. And as far as I have \nbeen informed in various briefings, he was not actively threatening our \ncountry or his neighbors or anyone else when he was dusted off the \nshelf by this administration right after Labor Day.\n  The President has properly refocused the world spotlight on this man \nand his intent. The President has drawn a line very clearly, which I \nsupport, that it would be intolerable for this Nation to permit that \ndictator to possess nuclear weapons or the missile capabilities to \ndeliver those warheads or any warheads against this country or against \nneighbors in the region surrounding him.\n  Certainly after September 11 and Operation Enduring Freedom, no one \nin this world could question the steely resolve of our President and \nhis willingness, if necessary, to use military force. After Operation \nEnduring Freedom, no one could raise a doubt about the might of the \nUnited States Armed Forces and the strength we can bring to bear \nanywhere in the world as a last resort, as truly a last resort.\n  But there is another lesson from September 11, which is that no \nmatter how great our military might, we are not invulnerable. We are \ntoo big a country. We have too wide an expanse. We have too many \npossible targets for terrorists. And we saw on September 11 tragically, \nhorribly, the damage and the destruction and the cost of human life and \nthe untold human suffering and misery of families that a very small \nnumber of fanatical men could cause.\n  I don't think we should back down or be deterred by any threat. I \nthink we should do what we must to defend this country, and the \nprinciples we have established in the last half century of dealing with \nthese threats have been ones that have prevented war, preserved our \npeace, and strengthened this country economically and socially in its \nposition of leadership in the world.\n  It would be a very dangerous precedent if we were to do, except as a \nvery last resort, what no President in this country has done before, \nwhich is to start a war, which is to launch a preemptive attack against \nanother country based on what it might in the future do to us. And I \nthink we should consider what that precedent would mean if other \nnations were to follow that example. If we set a precedent in this \n``new world order,'' as it has been called, that a preemptive attack \nagainst a possible future threat is the way to resolve crises or \nstandoffs, what will happen when other countries adopt that path?\n\n  We have seen now--and we have been forewarned--that the nuclear \nproliferation that we are seeing other countries undertake is the worst \nnightmare that many predicted years ago, decades ago if we didn't--the \nsuperpowers--bring to a halt the nuclear arms race and remove them from \nthe shelves of the nations of the world. Now we are told that half a \ndozen countries--and more to come soon--will have them. That should be \nand must be a warning to us. What happens if we lead down a path on \nwhich we don't want other nations to follow?\n  If we set a precedent of preemptive attack, that path is one that the \nworld will follow at its peril. I urge the President to take that into \nthe most careful consideration as he makes this fateful decision.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nArizona is to be recognized for up to 60 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/13/senate-section/article/S2414-1", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2414-S2423]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         OMNIBUS APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, usually I begin my diatribes on the \nappropriations bill by lifting up the appropriations bill for all to \nsee; one, it hasn't been delivered and, two, I note by the\n\n[[Page S2415]]\n\nsize of the existing copy down by the desk of the manager that it would \nbe quite a task to pick up this year's appropriations bill. At my \nadvanced age, I might be in danger of sustaining a hernia. But I still \nthink that this probably is--if I may borrow a phrase from one of our \nlongtime adversaries--the mother of all appropriations bills. It is \nsome 5,000 pages.\n  I can safely say that I have not read it. My staff has been \nfeverishly going through certain parts of it, each being parceled out. \nClearly, we have a mammoth conference report on this omnibus \nappropriations legislation, which nobody has been able to review, \nexamine, and debate. I say that not without sympathy for the Senator \nfrom Alaska, who is faced with a situation where negotiations--in fact, \nthey are going on almost as we speak, or are being completed as we \nspeak. Certainly, the reasons for the delay--some 4 months of delay--\nwas not under his control. But I want to discuss this very briefly in \ncontext.\n  The context that we are looking at with this legislation is a huge \nlooming deficit that is in front of us and growing in size almost as \nfar as the eye can see. The eye used to be able to see for 10 years. \nNow we have changed the procedures where the eye can only see for 5 \nyears. But only a short time ago, we were awash in huge surpluses. I \nwill never forget when Alan Greenspan testified before Congress in \nfavor of the 2001 tax cuts because we wanted to make sure we didn't \nspend down the debt too fast. We didn't want to spend down that debt \ntoo quickly because that would have some bad effects on our economy.\n\n  Well, we don't have to worry about spending the debt down too quickly \nnow. In 2001, we had a $127 billion surplus. We are living in a \ndifferent time now. The Congressional Budget Office recently forecast a \nlarger than expected deficit of $199 billion for this year; and last \nweek, with the result of the President's budget for 2004, the OMB \nprojected record deficits of $304 billion this year and $307 billion \nnext year.\n  I have, as chairman of the Commerce Committee, seen enough of our \nneeds for security and safety at our airports, railway stations, ports, \nall over America, to tell you that we have very large expenditures \nahead of us. Those expenditures are justified when we are talking about \nthe security of this Nation. The funding for the Transportation \nSecurity Administration was justified. I am proud that we not only \npassed the legislation, but we funded that enormous effort to ensure \nthe security of our airports, which is still not complete. But the fact \nis, we will soon run out of borrowing authority and might have to look \nto other sources of funding, such as the Social Security trust fund, in \nthe absence of a legislated increase in the debt ceiling.\n  There are a lot of words that are not used anymore around here, but \nthe one that has completely and totally disappeared is the good old \n``lockbox.'' I wonder what happened to the good old lockbox. That was \nthe one we were going to put Americans' payments into Social Security \ninto and we were never going to touch it again.\n  Not only is our economy in distress, we are also one step closer to \nwar. There are threats to national security that must be disposed of. \nYet this appropriations bill, in my view, has not changed since last \nyear. In fact, it is predictably about 11 times worse. The amounts \nassociated with each earmark may not seem extravagant, but taken \ntogether they represent an incredible diversion away from Federal \nprograms that have undergone the appropriate merit-based process.\n  I have two problems with this process. One, of course, is the \nappropriating of moneys that are really unnecessary and unauthorized \nand wasteful, very wasteful, but also in this legislation are many \nfundamental policy changes and, of course, I object, as chairman of the \nCommerce Committee, that it didn't go through my committee. But I \nobject to it even more when we have not had the open debate and votes \ntaken on matters that have national implications that are fundamental \npolicy decisions.\n  Let's go back to some of the necessary earmarks: First, $280,000 for \nasparagus technology and production in Washington; $220,000 to research \nfuture foods in Illinois--only in Illinois, of course.\n  My colleagues may note, as usual, the need for these earmarks are \nnearly always geographically based.\n  Next is $700,000 for the Midwest poultry consortium in Iowa; $250,000 \nfor research on the interaction of grapefruit juice and drugs. I always \nwondered what kind of experiments these are. One of our all-time \nfavorites, made famous a number of years ago, is money that was spent \nto study the effect on the ozone layer of flatulence in cows. One \nalways wondered about the testing procedures used to determine those \neffects on the ozone layer. This is another one that intrigues the \nobserver. Regarding the interaction of grapefruit juice and drugs, of \ncourse, one's imagination can be stimulated by the prospect of the \ninteraction of grapefruit juice and drugs.\n  Then we have $600,000 for tristate joint peanut research in Alabama; \n$500,000 for Missouri, Iowa, and Illinois Corn Growers Association for \na pilot program to develop ``production protocols.''\n  Again, I have to sometimes display my ignorance. I didn't know that \nin order to grow corn, there was a particular requirement for a \nprotocol regarding production.\n  I see that the Senator from Iowa just came on the floor. He may be \nable to illuminate me on the production protocols associated with corn \ngrowing. But whether he can or not, there will be $500,000 being split \nup between his State, Missouri, and Illinois to their corn growers \nassociations. But this won't be an overall production protocol; this is \nonly a pilot program. So I am sure there will be a great deal of \nadditional money coming once we develop the pilot program for \nproduction protocols of growing corn.\n  Next is $50,000 to combat ``feral hogs'' in Missouri. You know, \nsomewhere I had a little depiction of feral hogs. I did not know that \nthey were a threat to civilization as we know it, or at least enough to \nrequire $50,000 to combat feral hogs. Sometimes one would get the \nimpression that perhaps the people in Illinois could fund their own \ncombat scenario with feral hogs. Nonetheless, we will be coming in with \n50 grand to combat those feral hogs, which I am sure are a serious \nscourge.\n  There is $500,000 to continue hybrid poplar research in Wisconsin. I \nam sure next year we will have a continued program to develop \nproduction protocols for growing corn; $2 million for the biomass \ngasification research facility in Birmingham, AL. Again, I look forward \nto seeing what that is all about.\n  And then, staying right on this important mission of gasification, we \nhave another $500,000 for the gasification of switchgrass in Iowa. \nPerhaps switchgrass can be part of the production protocol of corn. But \none doesn't know; $1 million for the National Agricultural Based \nIndustrial Lubricant Center; $10 million to develop a high-speed data \ntransmission between the Library of Congress and education facilities, \nlibraries, and networks serving western North Carolina. I did not know \nthere was a special need in the western part of North Carolina, as \nthere might have been for other parts of the country. But we will spend \n$10 million to do that; $500,000 to be split between the Alexandria \nMuseum of Art and the New Orleans Museum of Art for activities relating \nto the celebration of the Louisiana Purchase bicentennial celebration; \n$200,000 for the replacement of Minton tile in the Capitol complex; $1 \nmillion for a company called Culpepper Glass in Warrenton, VA, that \nproduces glass display cases for the Library of Congress. I assume, of \ncourse, there is no other company that could produce glass display \ncases for the Library of Congress. That is why the Culpepper Glass \nCompany in Warrenton, VA, had to be designated in this legislation; $3 \nmillion for an award to the National Technology Transfer Center for a \ncoal slurry impoundment pilot project in southern West Virginia; $1 \nmillion for an automated nursery project in Mississippi; $500,000 for \nVermillion Community College in Ely, MN, for the development of a \nprofessional forest harvester program.\n  Mr. President, if my colleagues will indulge me, I have to go back to \nmy favorite from last time for just a moment. I know the hour is late, \nbut this is too much. We were able to keep, through very serious \ncontemplation and discussion among conferees, $1 million for a DNA bear \nsampling study in\n\n[[Page S2416]]\n\nMontana; $1 million will be spent to sample the DNA of bears in \nMontana.\n  Because these appropriations are never discussed with nonmembers of \nthe Appropriations Committee, one can only imagine and conjure up an \nidea as to how this might be used. Approach a bear: That bear cub over \nthere claims you are his father, and we need to take your DNA.\n  Approach another bear: Two hikers had their food stolen by a bear, \nand we think it is you. We have to get the DNA. The DNA doesn't fit, \nyou got to acquit, if I might.\n  I think it is important to appreciate that this $1 million for a DNA \nbear sampling study could solve a lot of crime in Montana. It is a \npretty high-crime area. It seems to me that is, indeed, a very \nworthwhile expenditure of the taxpayers' dollars.\n  While we are at it, I want to jump out of line here a second: \n$202,500 to the National Peanut Festival Fairgrounds for the \nconstruction of the National Peanut Festival Agriculture Arena in \nDothan, AL. I was interested in the National Peanut Festival. I did not \nsee it much on television or hear much about it. So I went to the Web \nsite, and I think you will be comforted to know we are spending this \n$202,500 for the 9-day celebration of the peanut harvest, which \nincludes a variety of competitions, including recipe contests, beauty \npageants, and tennis tournaments. Included for your viewing pleasure on \nthis Web site is a very interesting picture. I am sorry my colleagues \ncannot see it, but I would be willing to provide them with copies, but \nthere are three individuals standing by a contraption that I have not \nseen before, and it says farmers demonstrate antique peanut harvesting \nequipment at Pioneer Peanut Days. Again, it seems to me that is a \nworthwhile investment of $202,500.\n\n  I have also one more that is kind of interesting: $900,000 for the \nShow-me Aquatic Center for Development; $900,000 for the Show-me \nAquatic Center in Missouri. We found a picture of it. It says: ``Please \nTouch Me Museum, 210 North 21st Street, Philadelphia''--this is the \n270,000 Please Touch Me Museum, I apologize. That is for kids and \ngrownups. Of course, I had that confused with the very important \nfacility that is in Missouri. I certainly would not want to confuse the \ndifferent States.\n  One of the more remarkable aspects of this bill is in the HUD \nsection, under EDI. There are 885 individual earmarks. Some of them are \nvery interesting. Of course, there is $202,500 to continue the \nrehabilitation of the former Alaska Pulp Company mill site in Sitka, \nAK. I am reluctant to ask the Senator from Alaska how much that \ncontinuing rehabilitation is going to cost us overall.\n  We have a lot of important construction: $45,000 for the city of \nTuscumbia, AL, for construction of facilities associated with the Helen \nKeller Festival; $90,000 for the city of Prattville, AL, for the Boys \nand Girls Club of Prattville.\n  I mentioned the peanut festival. Here are a couple new ones: $810,000 \nfor the city of St. Louis, MO, for lighting sidewalks, curb, and street \nfurniture along Kings Highway Boulevard and Chippewa Street. It must be \na fairly serious situation there that we need to spend $810,000 down \nthere on Kings Highway Boulevard and Chippewa Street in St. Louis.\n  I mentioned the Show-Me Aquatic Center in Missouri; $105,000 for the \nFood and Agriculture Policy Research Institute in Columbia, MO, to \nanalyze commercial shipping alternatives; $90,000 to the city of \nNatchez, MS, for a feasibility study to develop a slack water port. \nThat is just for a feasibility study; $135,000 to the Culinary and \nHospitality Academy Center of Las Vegas, NV, for construction related \nto the expansion of an education training center. For those of you who \nhave not visited Las Vegas lately, I can tell you it is a very \ndepressed and deprived area, and I can certainly understand why the \nCulinary and Hospitality Academy Center would need $135,000. I thought \nthey could use some of mine.\n  For the arts, we have $162,000 for facilities renovations and \nimprovements for the Woolworth Theater in Glens Falls, NY; $162,000 for \nthe Catskill Mountain Foundation in Hunter, NY, for reconstruction of \nthe Tannersville Theater; $180,000 to the Bethel Performing Arts Center \nin Bethel, NY, for construction of a performing arts facility; $225,000 \nto the village of East Syracuse, NY for the renovation of the Hanlan \npool; $270,000 to Garth Fagan Dance Studio in Rochester, NY, for \nconstruction of a new theater for the Garth Fagan Dance \nStudio; $121,500 to the Bedford County Agricultural Society in \nPennsylvania for facilities improvements at the Bedford County \nFairground; $202,000 to the New York Agricultural Society for \nfacilities improvements to the New York Expo Center Arena and Livestock \nExpedition Hall, and I mentioned the Please Touch Museum in \nPhiladelphia, PA.; $810,000 to the City of Fort Worth, TX--another \nimpoverished area--for waterfront facilities construction for the \nTrinity River Basin Project; $180,000 to the Shenandoah Valley \nDiscovery Museum for facilities expansion; $216,000 to the Virginia \nLiving Museum in Newport News, and the list goes on.\n\n  There is a certain common thread one will find throughout these 885 \nprojects. I am sorry I did not have time to total it up, but it would \nhave to be in the tens of millions of dollars. There is one common \nthread. About 95 percent of these projects that are earmarked belong to \nthe States that are represented by members of the Appropriations \nCommittee.\n  I joke a lot about this, and I will continue to do so, but that is \nnot right. That is not the right thing to do.\n  I regret the conferees choose to adopt a special interest provision \nfor one foreign cruise ship company at the expense of all other \ncompanies. The last time Congress meddled in this area with hollow \npromises of spurring the American shipbuilding industry, it ended up \ncosting the American taxpayers $185 million in loan guarantees. It was \none of the most egregious I have seen of egregious things to take the \nmoney from a billionaire that--excuse me. We took no money from the \nbillionaire who runs river boat casinos and who tried to build two \nships in Pascagoula, MS, which every expert knows is not possible. The \nproject failed and the American taxpayer was on the hook for $185 \nmillion.\n  Not satisfied with costing the American taxpayer $185 million, a \nSenator from Hawaii put into this bill a requirement that grants a \nsubsidiary of the Malaysian-owned Norwegian Cruise Lines the exclusive \nright to operate three large foreign-built cruise vessels in the \ndomestic cruise trade. This will be permitted notwithstanding the \nPassenger Vessel Services Act, which requires vessels transporting \npassengers between ports in the U.S. to be U.S.-owned, U.S.-built, \nU.S.-flagged and U.S.-crewed.\n  I am not a fan of those requirements. But why in the world do we make \nexception for a law in an appropriations bill when you know what the \nresult is going to be? By granting exclusive rights to one cruise line, \nthere will be no competition and the people who want to cruise Hawaii \nwill pay much higher prices than for a commensurate cruise that people \nwould take out of the East Coast.\n  I do not know if the Presiding Officer has ever been to Miami, but \nthere are all kinds of ships cruising out of Miami, going all different \nplaces, for all different purposes, at very low cost. That is because \nthey are all competing against each other.\n  The Senator from Hawaii puts in a violation of law, and an \nexclusivity which is going to cost people who want to cruise the \nHawaiian Islands an enormously greater amount of money. Why? That is \ncrazy. I would have thought the Senator from Hawaii, after costing the \ntaxpayers $185 million because of a provision he put in an \nappropriations bill--it never went through my committee which has \noversight of it. It was never mentioned in my committee--after costing \nthe taxpayers $185 million, the Senator from Hawaii then pulls this \none. I am angry about it, and I will continue to be angry about \nit because the citizens of my State of Arizona would like to cruise the \nHawaiian Islands and they would like to do it at the cheapest possible \ncost. When there is no competition, there is not low cost.\n\n  There has been no analysis of granting this exclusive exemption from \nthe Passenger Vessel Services Act to the ``Norwegian Cruise Lines'' \nowned by a Malaysian company. Nor have the committees of jurisdiction \nhad an opportunity to consider the proposal.\n\n[[Page S2417]]\n\n  I tell the Senator from Alaska and the Senator from Hawaii, we are \ngoing to have a hearing on this issue, we are going to have a GAO \ninvestigation, and we are going to find out why they lost $185 million \nbecause of a provision put into this bill. We are also going to get an \nestimate of how much this exclusivity is going to cost my citizens who \nwant to go on a cruise at the least possible cost. I will not quit on \nthis issue. It is wrong, and it is the wrong way to treat this process. \nWe will have hearings in the Commerce Committee, and we will expose \nthis for what it is--disgraceful.\n  There are numerous other provisions in this conference report that \ncircumvent the clear jurisdiction of the Commerce Committee. It \nincorporates almost wholesale a bill passed last year by the House of \nRepresentatives regarding air traffic control towers. The provision \nexpands on the class of air traffic control towers that is eligible for \nFederal money. I am all for aviation safety and it may be a good \nprovision. I am troubled by several aspects of it.\n  First, the provision does not make new towers eligible for \nreimbursement. It makes eligible towers that were built beginning in \n1996, over 7 years ago. At least the provision passed last year by the \nHouse provided that an airport tower would be eligible for a grant \nunder this program only if the Secretary certified that the selection \nof the tower for eligibility was based on objective criteria giving no \nweight to any congressional committee report, joint explanatory \nstatement of a conference report, or statutory designation.\n  I wish to congratulate my House colleagues because they were \nconcerned about the pork barrel projects practice and tried to insulate \nthis particular program from such behavior. Guess what. That provision \nthat eliminated no objective criteria giving no weight to any \ncongressional committee report, joint explanatory statement of a \nconference committee, or statutory designation was eliminated. Why \nwould that be eliminated, I wonder?\n  The conference report also includes a provision and implements a \nwhole new funding scheme for airport security projects. I am very \nconcerned about funding for airport security. This is a reauthorization \nyear for aviation programs and the Senate Commerce Committee, the \ncommittee of jurisdiction, has already begun hearings of FAA issues. \nYet the appropriators have taken it upon themselves to establish a \nbrand new funding scheme that has never been vetted, discussed, or \nvoted on by the authorizing committee. Some might start to wonder just \nwhat the Commerce Committee's role is in policy decisions regarding the \nprograms under its jurisdiction.\n  This provision authorizes a new $2.5 billion program over 5 years for \nairport security projects without any discussion that I am aware of. \nThe TSA was not consulted about this provision. It seems the special \ninterest groups who were shopping this provision were the only ones \nthat mattered. If this had gone through the regular legislative \nprocess, at least all parties could have been heard.\n  There are many different ways to fund security projects. This \nprovision may be a good one. It mirrors a similar program set up at the \nFAA. However, the Department of Transportation Inspector General \nproposed several other ideas to our committee.\n  Another provision would allow airports to give airport improvement \nprogram money back to the FAA so the agency can hire staff to speed up \nenvironmental reviews of airport projects. This is an area in which the \nCommerce Committee took action last year and will continue to pursue \nthis year. It should not be addressed in an appropriations bill.\n  I commend the conferees for their attempts to help protect the \ninvestment the American taxpayers continue to provide to Amtrak. The \nconference report, which provides Amtrak $1.05 billion for fiscal year \n2003, includes conditions that require the funding to be appropriated \non a quarterly basis through formal grant agreements with DOT. The \nconferees worked to ensure that Amtrak reserved sufficient funds to \nmeet its contractual obligations with State and local subdivisions for \ncommuter and intercity corridor services. Amtrak should not be in a \nposition to shut down commuter operations as it threatened last summer \nbecause it does not have sufficient funds to operate its entire \nnetwork.\n  The conference committee has slightly reduced Amtrak's appropriation \nfrom that provided in the Senate-passed measure, but it has also \npostponed repayment of Amtrak's $100 million loan from DOT.\n  The conferees authorized the Secretary of Commerce to award grants \nand make direct lump sum payments of up to $50 million to support \ntravel to the United States. To carry out this new authority, the \nappropriators established the United States Travel and Tourism \nPromotion Advisory Board and provided $50 million. This tourism board \nhas never been considered by the authorizing committee of jurisdiction. \nNor did the Department of Commerce have any input on the creation of \nthis new board. Who came up with $50 million--and establish a new \nbureaucracy? The U.S. Travel and Tourism Promotion Advisory Board, and \ngives them $50 million.\n\n  I am pleased to see the conferees appropriated money for election \nreform. The conference report on NOAA provides more than $490 million \nin earmarks, and just for aquatic, not atmospheric programs of the \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, to go toward 150 \nearmarks. The administration did not request funding for these programs \nin the budget, and many programs they did request funding for are \nunderfunded or zero funded.\n  The conference report appropriated an astounding $100 million for \nfisheries disasters assistance. Of this amount, $35 million is for \ndirect assistance to the State of Alaska for any person, business, or \ntown that has experienced an economic hardship even remotely related to \nfishing. This is in addition to the $20 million they are also getting \nfor developing an Alaskan seafood marketing program. Of the remainder, \n$35 million is for the shrimp industries in the Gulf of Mexico and \nSouth Atlantic to provide far-reaching assistance for many aspects of \nthese fisheries; $20 million is provided for voluntary capacity \nreduction programs in the Northeast and west coast fisheries; $5 \nmillion is for Hawaiian fishermen affected by fishing area closures and \nother management rules; and $5 million is for blue crab fisheries \naffected by low harvests.\n  The conference report requires the Department of Commerce and Coast \nGuard to provide coordinated, routine support for fisheries monitoring \nand enforcement through use of remote-sensing aircraft and \ncommunications assets, with particular emphasis on Federal waters \nseaward to South Carolina and Georgia. Without review by the \nauthorizing committee, we have no basis for knowing why this is a good \nuse of Federal dollars and resources.\n  The conference report earmarks $10 million to promote and develop \nfishery products and research pertaining to American fisheries funds to \ndevelop an Alaskan seafood marketing program. Ten million is a lot of \nmoney to be spending on a marketing program.\n  As far as the Coast Guard is concerned, managers earmark a total of \n$83 million of the Coast Guard budget. That earmark is an increase of \n$10 million over last year, and many of them have obviously never been \nproposed.\n  In HUD, as I mentioned, 885 targeted grants.\n  I also will talk for a minute about the lowly catfish, one of my \nfavorite subjects. We know the lowly catfish has been the subject of a \ngreat deal of debate and discussion on the floor of the Senate due to \nthe fact that in another appropriations bill, we changed the name of \nthe catfish that comes from Vietnam to basa. But now the lowly catfish, \nthose that are still named catfish because they are raised in the \nUnited States, we are now qualifying catfish for livestock compensation \nprograms. Catfish are cows.\n  As my colleagues know, the livestock compensation program is a \nFederal farm program that compensates eligible livestock producers, \nsuch as owners of beef and dairy cattle, sheep, goats, or certain \nbreeds of buffalo that have suffered losses or damages as a result of a \nsevere drought. Now it is the catfish.\n  I often take issue with various farm policies that disproportionately \nbenefit large agribusinesss or farms at the expense of farmers and \ntaxpayers, and\n\n[[Page S2418]]\n\nthose that compromise American agricultural trade commitments. This \neffort to compensate catfish farmers from a farm program that is \nintended for livestock stands out. I am certain that catfish proponents \nwill offer a dozen different explanations to justify this provision. In \nfact, the last time we discussed this, one of my colleagues from \nTennessee talked about in his State there are catfish that leave the \nwater and travel in herds, so perhaps that is why we are now calling a \ncatfish a cow. But not even hog, poultry, or horse producers are \neligible under the livestock compensation program. Why should catfish \nthen get livestock payments?\n\n  We know labeling continues to be a nationally significant \nagricultural issue. Again, the issue was addressed in the \nappropriations bill.\n  The Army Corps of Engineers is, of course, one of the favorite \nplaces. Not only are there a lot of earmarks, but there are significant \nchanges in policy or law under the rubric of this appropriations bill. \nIn this legislation, the administration is prevented from proposing or \neven studying changes to the Army Corps of Engineers civil works \nprogram, such as reorganizing aspects of the agency's management \nstructure, without specific direction in an act of Congress. It seems \nto me that is remarkable micromanaging.\n  I guess I have taken enough of my colleagues' time at this late hour, \nand I know we should be voting on this bill and leaving. I point out \nagain, this bill which the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee described as the largest appropriations bill in the history--\nand I certainly take his word for it--in my now 17 years of monitoring \nthese things, has the largest number of earmarks by far. I find that \nwrong for a variety of reasons, but one of them being that we are \nsupposed to be in a war. We are about to ask young men and women to \nmake sacrifices. In fact, some of them in the next few weeks may make \nthe ultimate sacrifice. And here we are, business as usual, business as \nusual, larding on porkbarrel projects, running up the deficits to \nhistoric proportions in some respects. I imagine it is historic as far \nas the turnaround is concerned, from a $127 billion surplus to a $300 \nbillion deficit. I mind that very much. I think it is wrong. I think it \nis the wrong signal to send to the American people about our \nseriousness of addressing the challenges of the war on terror.\n  But I am also disturbed about the policy changes that are made in \nappropriations bills which render authorizing committees nearly \nirrelevant. It is not the right thing to do. There are provisions in \nthis bill--and I will be providing them for the record--of many policy \nchanges that should have required hearings, debate, votes on specific \nissues. Instead, they are decided by a small group of Senators and \nHouse Members rather than all of us being able to exercise not only our \nprivileges but our responsibilities as we determine the policies that \naffect the future of our citizens in our respective States.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a document entitled ``Commerce Committee \nProvisions'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     Commerce Committee Provisions\n\n\n                             ncl provision\n\n       Mr. President, I regret that the conferees chose to adopt a \n     special interest provision for one foreign cruise ship \n     company at the expense of all other competitors. The last \n     time Congress meddled in this area with hollow promises of \n     spurring the American ship building industry, it ended up \n     costing the American taxpayers a whopping $185 million. I \n     shudder to think that we are meddling again.\n       The conference report grants a subsidiary of the Malaysian-\n     owned ``Norwegian Cruise Lines'' (NCL) the exclusive right to \n     operate three large foreign-built cruise vessels in the \n     domestic cruise trade. This will be permitted notwithstanding \n     the Passenger Vessel Services Act, which requires vessels \n     transporting passengers between ports in the U.S. to be U.S.-\n     owned, U.S.-built, U.S.-flagged, and U.S.-crewed. While I am \n     not a fan of those requirements, I cannot support granting a \n     waiver for one company.\n       This provision provides an unfair competitive advantage to \n     NCL at the expense of all other cruise ship operators. No \n     other company will be allowed to operate foreign-built U.S.-\n     flag cruise vessels in the domestic market other than NCL. It \n     effectively creates a de facto monopoly for this one foreign \n     company to operate in the Hawaiian Islands, and West and East \n     Coast cruise trades.\n       Again, I remind my colleagues, the last time we provided \n     special treatment for one shipping company, it came at a \n     price tag of $185 million. American Classic Voyages' failed \n     ``Project America'' venture was aided by special exemption \n     language included in the 1998 Department of Defense \n     Appropriation Bill. When American Classic Voyages filed for \n     bankruptcy in October 2001, the American taxpayers paid the \n     price. At what point are we going to say enough is enough, \n     and put a halt to gambling away the hardworking Americans' \n     tax dollars?\n       Mr. President, there has been no analysis of the value of \n     granting this exclusive exemption from the Passenger Vessel \n     Services Act to NCL, nor, more importantly, have the \n     Committees of jurisdiction had an opportunity to consider the \n     proposal and analyze its overall impact on the maritime \n     industry.\n       The special interest provision represents yet another \n     piecemeal approach to U.S. maritime policy. But instead of \n     promoting a sound and reasoned U.S.-flag cruise vessel \n     promotion proposal, the conference report rewrites maritime \n     policy and grants one foreign-owned company a waiver from \n     U.S. laws.\n       We should be working to promote competition in the domestic \n     cruise market, and for that to take place, there needs to be \n     a level playing field for all operators. But the special NCL \n     provision may well severely hamper any effort to jump-start \n     the U.S.-flag cruise market, leaving most coastal states with \n     no regular U.S.-flag cruise ship service.\n       We learned the hard way from the failed ``Project America'' \n     venture that domestic-built ships require far more capital \n     investment than vessels built abroad. By giving NCL, and NCL \n     alone, a free pass on U.S. laws, as provided under this \n     conference report, will only keep all other competitors at \n     bay because they have no incentive to even attempt to secure \n     the significant financing required to comply with the U.S.-\n     build requirement for U.S.-owned cruise vessels.\n       This special provision for NCL will very likely lead to \n     further economic difficulties for the domestic cruise \n     industry, and places its future growth at risk.\n\n\n                                aviATIoN\n\n       Mr. President, there are numerous other provisions in this \n     conference report that circumvent the clear jurisdiction of \n     the Commerce Committee. For example, it incorporates almost \n     wholesale a bill passed last year by the House of \n     Representatives regarding air traffic control towers. The \n     provision expands on the class of air traffic control towers \n     that is eligible for federal money. While I'm all for \n     aviation safety and this may be a good provision, I'm \n     troubled by several aspects of it.\n       First, the provision doesn't just make new towers eligible \n     for reimbursement, it also makes eligible towers that were \n     built beginning in 1996--over seven years ago.\n       Things were very different seven years ago. Bill Clinton \n     was President and I had more hair. I know President Clinton's \n     theme song was ``Don't Stop Thinking About Tomorrow,'' by \n     Fleetwood Mac, but I find it very difficult to believe that \n     airports that built towers in 1996 had any expectation they \n     should get reimbursed by the federal government seven years \n     later. It's awfully nice that we're willing to do that. I \n     didn't know this omnibus bill was also the first economic \n     stimulus package of the year. Had I known, I might have \n     sought inclusion of a payroll tax holiday!\n       Secondly, at least the provision passed last year by the \n     House provided that an airport tower would be eligible for a \n     grant under this program only if the Secretary certified that \n     the selection of the tower for eligibility was based on \n     objective criteria, giving ``no weight to any congressional \n     committee report, joint explanatory statement of a conference \n     report, or statutory designation.'' I wish to congratulate my \n     House colleagues. Clearly, they were concerned about the pork \n     barrel politics practiced by the appropriators and tried to \n     insulate this particular program from such antics. However, \n     the appropriations committee decided that this took away too \n     much of their power and deleted the provision. I don't mean \n     they rewrote the provision. They literally crossed it out in \n     the conference report.\n       Mr. President, the conference report also includes a \n     provision that implements a whole new funding scheme for \n     airport security projects. I am very concerned about finding \n     for airport security. This is a reauthorization year for \n     aviation programs, and the Senate Commerce Committee, the \n     committee of jurisdiction, has already begun hearings on FAA \n     issues.\n       Yet the appropriators have taken it upon themselves to \n     establish a brand new funding scheme that has never been \n     vetted, discussed, or voted on by the authorizers. Some might \n     start to wonder just what the Commerce Committee's role is in \n     policy decisions regarding the programs under its \n     jurisdiction.\n       This provision authorizes a new $2.5 billion program over 5 \n     years for airport security projects without any discussion \n     that I am aware of. The TSA was not consulted about this \n     provision. It seems that the special interest groups who were \n     shopping this provision were the only ones that mattered. If \n     this had gone through the regular legislative process, at \n     least all parties could have been heard. There are many \n     different ways to fund security projects. This provision may \n     be a good one, it mirrors a similar program set up at the \n     FAA. However, the DOT Inspector\n\n[[Page S2419]]\n\n     General proposed several other ideas to our committee.\n       Another provision would allow airports to giver Airport \n     Improvement Program (AIP) money back to the FAA so the agency \n     can hire staff to speed up environmental reviews airports \n     projects. This is an area in which the Commerce Committee \n     took action on last year and will continue to pursue this \n     year. It should not be addressed in an appropriations bill.\n       While the earmarking in this legislation is as egregious as \n     ever, the raiding of existing accounts for unrelated purposes \n     is equally appalling. The AIP program is supposed to be \n     devoted to the infrastructure needs of our nation's airports. \n     Yet the conference report takes tens of millions of dollars \n     out of AIP to pay for the FAA's costs of administering the \n     EAS program, and the Small Community Air Service Development \n     Pilot Program. These are worthy activities and programs, but \n     it violates the long-established purpose of AIP to use monies \n     for these things. This continual raiding of AIP which is also \n     being encroached upon by the appropriation of security costs \n     from it will slow the necessary development of the nation's \n     infrastructure. We may be in an aviation funding crisis this \n     year if this wholesale taking of money from accounts that are \n     for capacity, infrastructure and modernization does not stop.\n\n\n                                 Amtrak\n\n       I want to commend the conferees for their attempts to help \n     protect the investment that the American taxpayers continue \n     to provide to Amtrak, which since 1971, has received federal \n     subsidies totaling $26 billion--an enormous sum for a system \n     that serves less than one percent of the traveling public.\n       The conference report, which provides Amtrak $1.05 billion \n     for FY 2003, includes conditions that require the funding to \n     be appropriated on a quarterly basis through formal grant \n     agreements with the Department of Treasury (DOT). Amtrak also \n     will be required to spend its appropriated funds only on \n     items identified in its business plan and approved by DOT. \n     And, such funds may only be spent on existing plant and \n     services, not on grandiose or far-fetched expansion plans. \n     These controls are a step in the right direction.\n       The conferees also worked to ensure that Amtrak reserves \n     sufficient funds to meet its contractual obligations with \n     state and local subdivisions for commuter and intercity \n     corridor services. Amtrak should not be in a position to shut \n     down commuter operations, as it threatened last summer, \n     because it does not have sufficient funds to operate its \n     entire network. Commuter operations, such as those on the \n     Northeast Corridor, are funded by state and local governments \n     and clearly should continue to operate even if other Amtrak \n     operations should cease. Further, Corridor trains that the \n     states are helping subsidize also should also receive \n     priority. Continuing to operate Northeast Corridor services, \n     off-Corridor commuter service, and those trains financed in \n     part by the states would preserve service for 93 percent of \n     Amtrak's combined intercity and commuter ridership.\n       While the conference committee has slightly reduced \n     Amtrak's appropriation from that provided in the Senate-\n     passed measure, from $1.2 billion to $1.05 billion, it also \n     has postponed repayment of Amtrak's $100 million dollar loan \n     from DOT, effectively providing Amtrak's $1.15 billion, or \n     only $50 million less than the $1.2 billion Amtrak requested. \n     Although Amtrak may end the year with less than its targeted \n     $75 million in working capital, it should be able to continue \n     operating while Congress considers the long-term future for \n     intercity passenger rail service. I look forward to a full \n     and open debate on this issue.\n\n\n                             Tourism Board\n\n       Mr. President, the conferees authorize the Secretary of \n     Commerce to award grants and make direct lump sum payments of \n     up to $50,000,000 to support ravel to the United States. To \n     carry out this new authority, the appropriators establish the \n     United States Travel and Tourism Promotion Advisory Board and \n     provide $50,000,000. This Tourism Board has never been \n     considered by the authorizing committee of jurisdiction, nor \n     did the Department of Commerce have any input on the creation \n     of this new Board. This is another example of authorizing \n     language in an appropriations bill and $50,000,000 is an \n     enormous amount of money for an initiative that has not yet \n     been fully vetted.\n\n\n                                  NASA\n\n       Mr. President, I commend the conferees for their efforts to \n     address the funding needs of the Space Shuttle Columbia \n     accident investigation. Just yesterday, the Commerce \n     Committee held a hearing on the investigation, and I agree \n     that the Congress should be supportive of the Columbia \n     Accident Investigation Board. We must find the cause of this \n     horrible tragedy, and ensure that such an accident never \n     happens again.\n       Unfortunately, other NASA provisions are included in the \n     conference report that should be handled by the authorizing \n     committee of jurisdiction. For example, the conference report \n     establishes a NASA working capital fund for capital repairs, \n     renovations, rehabilitation, sustainment, demolition, or \n     replacement of NASA real property. As Chairman of the Senate \n     Commerce Committee, which has jurisdiction over NASA, I am \n     fully aware of NASA's declining infrastructure and the need \n     to ensure safety of NASA missions. In light of the \n     Space Shuttle Columbia accident, I think it would be a \n     prudent course of action if we fully consider this \n     provision in the context of an overall review of NASA, \n     which is currently underway. No hearings have yet been \n     held on this proposed working capital fund, nor has it \n     been considered by the full Senate. I do not question the \n     conferees' strong interest in addressing NASA funding \n     needs, but I note this is yet another case of authorizing \n     on an appropriations bill.\n       I am particularly concerned by provisions in the conference \n     report that would establish a NASA demonstration project \n     regarding an enhanced-use lease of real property. The \n     Commerce Committee has not had a change to review this \n     language, and no hearings have been held on this enhanced \n     lease scheme. The leasing of public property deserves a \n     public discussion.\n\n\n                            election reform\n\n       I am pleased to see that the conferees appropriated almost \n     $1.5 billion to implement the election reform bill. This \n     funding is a good start for a process to improve our system \n     of election administration and renew the public's confidence \n     in our election system. I am especially pleased that this \n     conference report includes payments to help states to promote \n     disabled voter access.\n\n\n                                  noaa\n\n       The conference report provides more than $490 million in \n     earmarks and programs just for the aquatic--not atmospheric--\n     programs of the National Oceanic and Atmosphere \n     Administration. This funding will go toward more than 150 \n     line items. The Administration did not request funding for \n     these programs in their budget, in fact, many programs that \n     they did request funding for are underfunded or zero-funded.\n       The conference report appropriates an astounding \n     $100,000,000 for fisheries disaster assistance. Of this \n     amount, $35,000,000 is for direct assistance to the state of \n     Alaska, for any person, business, or town that has \n     experienced an economic hardship even remotely related to \n     fishing. This money is in addition to the $20,000,000 they \n     are also getting for developing an Alaskan seafood marketing \n     program.\n       Of the remainder:\n       $35,000,000 is for the shrimp industries of the Gulf of \n     Mexico and South Atlantic, to provide far-reaching assistance \n     for many aspects of these fisheries;\n       $20,000,000 is provided for voluntary capacity reduction \n     programs in the Northeast and West Coast groundfish \n     fisheries;\n       $5,000,000 is for Hawaiian fishermen affected by fishing \n     area closures and other management rules; and\n       $5,000,000 is for blue crab fisheries affected by low \n     harvests.\n       The report also provides these hand-outs without requiring \n     any accountability for how the money is actually spent. These \n     appropriations were made without offering any form of \n     justification or rationale. How much federal money do these \n     regions really need, if any? If these needs are legitimate, \n     how do they compare to the needs of other regions? We'll \n     never know, because these appropriations circumvented every \n     stage of committee review, consultation, analysis, and \n     authorization. We have no basis for determining how necessary \n     this is or whether or not this is sound policy.\n       Furthermore, the conference report requires the Department \n     of Commerce and Coast Guard to provide coordinated, routine \n     support for fisheries monitoring and enforcement through use \n     of remote sensing, aircraft, and communications assets, with \n     particular emphasis on federal waters seaward of the costs of \n     South Carolina and Georgia. Again, without any review by the \n     authorizing committee, we have no basis or knowing why this \n     is regional program is a good use of federal dollars and \n     resources is this really the best use of limited Coast Guard \n     resources, at a time when our country is under a heightened \n     terror alert?\n       The conference report also earmarks $10 million from the \n     ``Promote and Develop Fishery Products and Research \n     Pertaining to American Fisheries'' fund, to develop an \n     Alaskan seafood marketing program. $10 million is whole lot \n     of money to be spending on a marketing program, yet we are \n     given no details on exactly what this federal funding will be \n     used.\n\n\n                              coast guard\n\n       The conference report and statement of managers earmarks a \n     total of $83.962 million of the Coast Guard budget. The level \n     of Coast Guard earmarks increased over $10 million compared \n     to the enacted FY02 Coast Guard budget.\n       In this critical time when the Coast Guard is so hard \n     pressed to carry out it Homeland Security missions, in \n     addition to its many traditional missions, it is indefensible \n     to be earmarking the Coast Guard's budget for pet products. \n     Adding insult to injury, the Committee report takes the Coast \n     Guard to task for devoting its scarce resources to homeland \n     security at the expense of its other traditional missions, \n     yet in the same report, they earmark critically needed \n     resources for other projects. This type of micro-management \n     serves only to tie the Coast Guard's hands and deny it the \n     flexibility it needs to respond to very real threats.\n       We all know the Coast Guard is underfunded and definitely \n     in need of additional personnel and resources. Our first step \n     should be to give it is full budget without these unrequested \n     and restrictive earmarks.\n       Here are just a few examples.\n\n[[Page S2420]]\n\n       The statement of managers earmarks $1,600,000 for enhanced \n     oil spill prevention activities in the waters of Washington \n     State. This earmark was not requested by the Administration \n     and I think it should probably receive an award for the most \n     creative language. It states, and I quote, ``the Committee \n     expects the Captain of the Port to use his professional \n     judgment in allocating these funds to measures that he \n     believes will best protect these waters. Such measures \n     could include a cost sharing arrangement with the State of \n     Washington for the hiring of a rescue tug at Neah Bay. \n     However, these funds could be allocated to alternative \n     measures if, in the view of the Captain of the Port, such \n     alternative measures will provide a superior level of \n     protection.'' Does anyone wonder what decision the \n     Appropriations Committee expects this Coast Guard captain \n     to make?\n       $4 million is for LTS-101 helicopter engines.\n       The statement of managers earmarks $10,000,000 of the Coast \n     Guard's Acquisition, Construction, and Improvements budget \n     for a new line item entitled ``Security Surveillance and \n     Protection.'' What does this mean? The Senate report vaguely \n     stated that this provision is to develop and acquire \n     equipment that will improve security surveillance and \n     perimeter protection capabilities in the Nation's ports, \n     waterways, and coastal zones. In other words, it could mean \n     almost anything.\n       The statement of managers earmarks $16,000,000 for costs \n     associated with repairing and rebuilding the Coast Guard's \n     Integrated Support Center at Pier 36 in Seattle. These funds \n     are in addition to the $10,000,000 earmarked for this project \n     in the FY 2002 Transportation Appropriations bill. None of \n     these are funds were requested by the Administration and this \n     project is not one of the Coast Guard's highest priorities \n     for shoreside construction. My question is, how much will be \n     earmarked for this project in next year's budget?\n       Of particular note, the Conference report earmarks over 27 \n     percent of the Coast Guard's research and development budget \n     for specific projects. These earmarks will hinder the Coast \n     Guard's efforts to better surveil our ports, create new \n     technologies to detect explosives and weapons of mass \n     destruction, and develop non-lethal technologies.\n       The statement of managers earmarks $1,000,000 to support \n     the continued development, demonstration, and evaluation of \n     engineered wood composites at Coast Guard facilities. The \n     statement of managers also earmarks $1,000,000 for a pilot \n     project to test automatic search and rescue spectral imaging \n     technology for Coast Guard C-130 aircraft solely located at \n     Kalaeloa, Hawaii.\n       Once again we are seeing an Appropriations Bill attempting \n     to circumvent the authorization process. This bill would \n     limit the funding for Coast Guard flag officers to 37. The \n     Coast Guard is authorized under Title 14 to have 48 flag \n     officers and currently has 37 flag officers on active duty. \n     As the Coast Guard grows in size to meet its new homeland \n     security missions it will not have any of its authorized \n     flexibility to promote additional flag officers. If there is \n     a concern that the Coast Guard has too many flag officers, \n     then that concern should be raised through the Commerce \n     Committee.\n       The bill authorizes the Coast Guard Yard at Curtis Bay, \n     Maryland and other Coast Guard specialty facilities \n     designated by the Commandant to enter into joint public-\n     private partnerships and in doing so may enter into \n     agreements, receive, and retain funds from and pay funds to \n     such public and private entities, and may accept \n     contributions of funds, materials, services, and the use of \n     facilities from such entities. This provision would enable \n     the federally subsidized Yard to indirectly compete with \n     private industry for shipbuilding contracts. This is \n     authorization language pertaining to the Coast Guard Yard \n     that is clearly within the jurisdiction of the Commerce, \n     Science, and Transportation Committee. Nonetheless prior to \n     the consideration of this legislation by the Appropriations \n     Committee, it did not consult with or notify either the \n     Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee concerning \n     the changes in law.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the Senator from Nevada had an inquiry. I \nyield to the Senator from Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Just so the two leaders know, does the Senator from \nIllinois know for how long he wishes to speak?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Senator from Nevada what the plans are for this \nevening?\n  Mr. REID. What we are working toward is having final passage on the \nbill this evening, if all things work out right.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I certainly don't want to delay final passage.\n  Mr. REID. Why doesn't the Senator proceed.\n  The Senator from Georgia also wishes to speak for 3 minutes?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Why don't we have the Senator from Georgia speak first for \n3 minutes, and then the Senator from Illinois speak. If the managers \nwant to speak then, they can do so. I so ask unanimous consent.\n  Mr. STEVENS. It is 5 minutes and 3 minutes, is that correct?\n  Mr. REID. He's going to stop whenever you want him to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. All right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I don't think I will take my full 3 \nminutes. I just want to rise and say that while, Mr. Chairman, I am \ngoing to vote for the omnibus bill, I am really disappointed with the \nagriculture disaster portion in this omnibus bill. On the Senate side, \nwe debated and discussed this issue at length. The chairman of the \nSenate Agriculture Committee, who is also chairman of the Senate \nAgriculture Appropriations subcommittee, I thought did an excellent job \nof putting together a package that accomplishes the goal of getting \nfunds immediately in the hands of farmers all across America. My \nfarmers have had 5 rough years back to back, and they need money now.\n  Under the provisions that came out of the conference committee, which \nwas basically the House provision, farmers across America are not going \nto be getting funds until probably August, September, or October. \nFarmers are going to be out of business if they don't get relief now. \nTo pass this provision in this bill I think is the wrong approach. I \ndon't like that provision in the bill. I do support it. I know the \nchairman had a very difficult time with this particular issue as well \nas other issues, but I think that is wrong and I wanted to register my \nobjection. I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, as a member of the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee, I know the amount of labor and work that goes into the \npreparation of a bill of this magnitude. I also know when you postpone \nthe orderly process of passing spending bills and wait an extra 4 or 5 \nmonths, there is an opportunity for mischief. I think only in time will \nwe be able to sift through 1,600, 1,800, 2,000 pages of this bill to \nfind out in painful detail what is included.\n  There are several things that have come to my attention. I would like \nto draw them to the attention of my colleagues here in the Senate.\n  Let me start by saying there is one issue most people don't like to \ntalk about and I am going to raise this evening because I think it is \ncritically important. The District of Columbia is a city which is \ngoverned by a mayor, a city council, and 535 wannabe mayors in the \nCongress.\n  It seems that every Member of the House or Senate who wanted to be a \nmayor at some time in their lives decided at some point to make a \ndecision for the District of Columbia. I think that is unfortunate. The \npeople of this city, like every city, have a right to govern \nthemselves. Occasionally that intrusion of congressional mischief can \nreach a perilous state. Let me give an example.\n  The AIDS rate for the AIDS disease in our Nation's Capital is the \nhighest in the country. It is 10 times the national average. More and \nmore women are being diagnosed with AIDS in Washington, DC. DC health \nofficials reported last October 616 new AIDS cases in 2001 alone, 33 \npercent among women. In 1981 women only accounted for 7 percent of AIDS \ncases.\n  City health officials in Washington estimate 40 percent of AIDS cases \nare associated with injected drugs.\n  The question is, how can we stop this AIDS epidemic in the Nation's \nCapital, which is not only infecting more and more women and children, \nbut appears to be out of control. Frankly, there are programs that \nwork. One of the programs is not popular to talk about. Most of my \ncolleagues run away from it, but you cannot run away from reality. It \nis a needle exchange program. It is a program that invites addicts in, \nin an effort to try to first give them a needle that is clean, and then \nbring them into rehabilitation so they can stop their addiction.\n  There are those who say don't give them clean needles because they \nwill just keep using them. But you know what they will use, they will \nuse dirty needles and pass the AIDS epidemic on and on and on.\n  I am not expert in this area. I get squeamish talking about needles \nand\n\n[[Page S2421]]\n\ninjections. But the fact is, the people who are experts, the American \nMedical Association and medical officials, have said it works. Put \nthese programs on the street corners and in the storefronts of \nWashington, DC, and we can start reducing the AIDS infection rate in \nour Nation's Capital.\n  There is no reason in my mind why the people of the District of \nColumbia should not be able to use their own money to try this approach \nto reduce drug addiction and reduce the AIDS epidemic in their \nhometown.\n  Across the United States, there are programs in many States. But \nsadly enough, the Members of the House of Representatives have put in a \nprovision that prohibits the District of Columbia from even using its \nown tax dollars to in any way support this kind of project.\n  Some of the very congressmen who beat on the desk and beat on their \nchest and talk about how they are going to fight these needle exchange \nprograms represent districts and States where these programs take place \ntoday. This is a sad outcome in this bill. I hope those who reflect on \nit will realize they are taking some high and mighty moral position and \npeople will die because of it.\n  Stand by the doctors, stand by the professionals. Stop playing mayor \nand city council for the District of Columbia. Sadly, this \nappropriation continues to do so.\n  Exhaustive scientific review has found that needle exchange programs \nare an effective way to slow the spread of HIV and AIDS. In a speech \nlast September. Dr. Joseph O'Neill, Director of the Office of National \nAIDS policy indicated that the administration did not oppose the use of \nstate and local funds to support needle exchange programs.\n  The American Medical Association, the American Nurses Association, \nthe American Association of Pediatrics, and the American Public Health \nAssociation endorse these programs. The Institute of Medicine \nidentified access to sterile syringes as one of four ``unrealized \nopportunities'' in HIV prevention in a publication issued last year. \nThe IOM committee recommends that the Administration ``rescind the \nexisting prohibition against the use of Federal funds for needle \nexchange to allow communities that desire such programs to institute \nthem using federal resources.''\n  Former Surgeon General David Satcher, MD stated that:\n\n       There is conclusive scientific evidence that syringe \n     exchange programs, as part of a comprehensive HIV prevention \n     strategy, are an effective public health intervention that \n     reduces transmission of HIV and does not encourage the \n     illegal use of drugs.\n\n  Former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, MD concluded that needle \nexchange programs are an ``effective means of preventing the spread of \nthe disease [HIV/AIDS] without increasing the used of illicit drugs.'' \nHe called limiting the use of state and local funds for these programs \n``counterproductive.''\n  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that there \nwere 156 needle exchange programs operating in the United States in 81 \ncities and 31 States last year, many of which receive state and local \nfinancial support for their activities. None of these programs receive \nFederal support at this time.\n  The CDC publication also indicated that 95 percent of needle exchange \nprograms in operation referred clients to substance use treatment and \ncounseling programs, and over half provide on site voluntary HIV \ntesting and more than a quarter also screen for hepatitis B and C.\n  In 2000, four needle exchange programs were functioning in my home \nstate of Illinois.\n  In spite of the overwhelming support from public health and medical \nprofessionals, we here in Congress have once again prevented the \nDistrict of Columbia from using its own local funds to finance these \nlifesaving programs. I was pleased that the Omnibus Appropriations bill \npassed by the Senate allowed the District of Columbia to use LOCAL \nfunds to finance a needle exchange program. Washington, DC has one \nneedle exchange program, Prevention Works, that is supported with \nprivate funding. Both the Mayor and Police Chief support the program.\n  However, I am deeply disappointed to learn that the conference report \nwe are considering today maintains the irresponsible status quo, which \nprevents the District from using its own locally generated revenue to \nfinance needle exchange programs.\n  This conference report disregards the expert opinions of former \nSurgeon Generals David Satcher and C. Everett Koop, leading medical and \npublic health organizations, the Director of the Office of National \nAIDS policy and the Institute of Medicine.\n  It is my sincere hope that next year we will stop politicizing this \nissue and recognize that the District of Columbia, just like all of our \nhome states and districts, deserves to have all possible resources at \nits disposal to combat this devastating public health crisis.\n  The same is true when it comes to attorneys' fees for special \neducation. Think about this. In every school district in America, if \nyou have a disabled child and want that child to have an education, you \nhave a right to say to the school district: Here is my child who needs \nthe education. If the school district contests it and says this child \ndoesn't have a disability and we are not going to pay for a special ed \nteacher, you have a right to appeal that decision. That's the case \nacross America.\n  Sometimes, because it is complicated and expensive, attorneys are \ninvolved to represent the parents and the school district and to \nresolve their differences. It happens every day across America.\n  In the District of Columbia it has gotten out of hand. Some law \nfirms--only a few--have exploited the parents of disabled children and \nturned in attorneys' fees requests to the District of Columbia public \nschool system that are way out of line. Some of these firms have become \nshady operations that offer not only attorney counseling, but special \neducation services, a package that raises many suspicions.\n  Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison and I have debated this over and over \nagain as to whether to cap the fees that can be paid to attorneys and \nwhat to do about it. In the Senate we raised the cap on attorneys' fees \nfor DC special education to $4,000 maximum per case. I hope that is \nenough to take care of these cases. But I will tell you I do not \nbelieve we should be imposing a cap on attorneys' fees. The parents of \nthese poor children who are disabled should not be denied legal \nrepresentation.\n  I am happy Senator Hutchison and I could agree on limiting the \nattorneys' activities so those questionable activities, those criminal \nactivities will stop. But I think we should put an end to this cap on \nattorneys' fees and say to the DC public school system once and for \nall, for goodness sakes, offer kids with disabilities the kind of \nspecial education opportunities that are available across America. This \nprovision capping attorneys' fees in this appropriation bill I think is \na mistake.\n  Not only are such caps an intrusion on home rule and local spending \nprerogatives, I do not believe that imposing a cap on payment of \nattorneys' fees is the way to address significant and long-standing \nproblems with the delivery of special education services to children in \nthe District of Columbia. These fees arise because parents are forced \nto bring due process actions against the city school system--and the \nparents win their cases.\n  It is unacceptable for Congress to impose a dollar cap on how much \nthe City may pay attorneys who win these cases, particularly after a \njudge has awarded a fee based on a reasonableness standard. However, I \ndo support language in this bill which addresses concerns about \nparticular attorneys who have shamelessly taken advantage of the \nsystem.\n  I support a complete bar on paying attorneys' cases in which the \nDistrict's Chief Financial Officer, CFO, determines that an attorney, \nofficer, or employee of the firm has a pecuniary interest in any \nspecial education diagnostic services, schools, or other special \neducation service providers.\n  Furthermore, I believe the provisions in the Senate bill which \nmandate stronger ethical standards are appropriate.\n  I support the provisions in the bill dictating that the District's \nCFO require disclosure by attorneys in IDEA cases of any financial, \ncorporate, legal, board membership, or other relationships with special \neducation diagnostic services, schools, or other special education \nservice providers before paying any attorneys' fees; that the CFO may\n\n[[Page S2422]]\n\nrequire certification by counsel that all services billed in special \neducation were rendered; that the CFO report to Congress quarterly on \nthe certifications and the amount paid by the government of the \nDistrict of Columbia, including the District of Columbia Public \nSchools, to attorneys in cases brought under IDEA; and that the \nDistrict's Inspector General may audit the certifications to ensure \nattorney compliance.\n  It is my hope that these provisions will produce needed \naccountability. I am glad they were retained in the final product.\n  I am disappointed, but not surprised, that the cap remains in this \nfinal version of the bill. I share the sentiment that abuses of this \nprogram need to stop. I want to work to address that problem and to \nfigure out why the District has had such perennial problems with its \nability to meet the needs of its children in special education.\n  But it is wrong for this Republican Congress to deprive children of \nlegal recourse when they are denied services to which they are \nentitled. It is wrong for the Republican Congress to preclude the \nDistrict of Columbia from using its own funds to make all legitimate \npayments in this critical special education program.\n  There is another provision that was slipped in this bill as it \nrelates to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and the Freedom \nof Information Act. This provision is an enormous setback to the \nefforts of State and local governments to combat illegal firearms \ntrafficking. It undermines the very purpose of the Freedom of \nInformation Act.\n  This act entitles citizens to open access to Government records, \nprevents the Government from shielding its activities from public \nscrutiny. The City of Chicago, which I represent, filed a Freedom of \nInformation Act request to obtain information about the ATF trace \ndatabase. The purpose, of course, is to determine which gun sellers and \nmanufacturers were responsible for selling guns to criminals.\n  In response to these rulings, the gun industry went to the House \nAppropriations Committee and asked for a rider in this bill to prevent \nthe ATF from complying with the FOIA request and telling the City of \nChicago and the public what they were doing.\n  This provision sets a dangerous precedent because it essentially \ndirects a Federal agency not to comply with the Federal court ruling, \nthus undermining the very purpose of FOIA. If litigants can be denied \ninformation under FOIA through legislative action--even when a Federal \ncourt has upheld this request--FOIA itself is in jeopardy.\n  There is no cost justification for this. This doesn't have anything \nto do with appropriations. This is an effort by the gun industry to \nstop cities that are ravaged by gun crime from going after the \nirresponsible gun dealers who are selling guns to criminals. And the \nNRA and the gun industry are shielding them with this rider in the \nappropriations bill.\n  I was joined by Senators Jack Reed and Ted Kennedy in urging that \nthis provision not be included. Unfortunately, it was.\n  Let me acknowledge also, as has been said by some of my colleagues, \nthat I am very concerned about the language of funding for homeland \nsecurity in this bill. The Senate, in its version of this bill, added \nalmost $4 billion in homeland security funds to be sent back to the \nState and local governments to protect America. As I stand and speak on \nthe floor of the Senate, we are warning families across America that we \nare in orange alert and that they have to take special precautions to \nprotect themselves and their children from the possibility of \nbiological and chemical warfare and dirty radioactive bombs.\n  Sadly enough, we are not providing the resources for the State and \nlocal governments to meet this challenge. Make no mistake, America is \nprepared to attack in the Middle East, but America is not prepared to \ndefend itself at home. That is a sad reality. This bill cuts out almost \n$4 billion that would have gone for some very important purposes: \nAdditional money for the Transportation Security Administration for \nmonitoring airports; additional money for the INS and border security \nto stop those from coming in this country who are bent on bad behavior; \ncommunity policing grants to try to help communities have someone on \nthe other end of the line when you dial 9-1-1, cut $130 million; FEMA \ndisaster recovery assistance, cut by $1 billion; the Department of \nJustice Office of Domestic Preparedness, cut by $1 billion; firefighter \ngrants, cut by $150 million; interoperable communications equipment \ngrants, cut by $235 million--the No. 1 priority in my State so that the \npolice and firefighters and medical first responders can communicate, \ncut in this appropriations bill from the Senate level.\n  These cuts, frankly, came at the request and with the approval of the \nWhite House and the Office of Management and Budget.\n  Emergency Operation Center, cut nationwide by $155 million; port \ncontainer security, cut by $45 million; port technology demonstration \nprojects so that we can see dangerous cargo coming in these ships, cut \nby $1 million; explosives training initiative, cut by $7 million; and \n$42 million from embassy security.\n  I pray to God that nothing happens to this country as a result of \nterrorism. But I think we have been derelict in our duty to provide the \nresources to State and local governments to protect families and to \nprotect communities and businesses across America. This bill, with its \n$4 billion in cuts off the Senate level, leaves us in a precarious \nsituation and one that I hope does not come back to haunt us in years \nto come.\n  Let me conclude on a positive note. I thank the Senator from Alaska. \nDespite these words of critique, I personally appreciate, as does \nSenator DeWine, the personal interest and initiative he took in the \nglobal AIDS epidemic. His decision on the floor to approve an amendment \nwhich we offered is going to mean that thousands and maybe more will \nhave their lives saved. I thank the Senator from Alaska. He has been a \nleader on this issue all the way. We have reached a 42-percent increase \nin funding to fight the global AIDS epidemic through his cooperation \nand leadership. I thank him very much.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a statement entitled ``Underfunding \nHomeland Security'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     Underfunding Homeland Security\n\n       At a time when the Administration is ramping up for war \n     overseas, one would think we would be doing everything \n     possible to fortify our security at home as well.\n       That's certainly what the Administration has led us to \n     believe, but oddly enough, we're poised to pass this 1100 \n     plus page omnibus bill that slashes funding for the pillars \n     of homeland security.\n       And after cutting funds for first responders, for airport \n     security improvements, for community police officers and \n     more, what do they propose? That Americans fortify their own \n     homes with duct tape and plastic sheets. This Administration \n     can and must do better to protect the safety of the American \n     people.\n       This bill leaves significant gaps in funding for homeland \n     security priorities.\n       The Republican-controlled conference committee rejected \n     increases in homeland security funding that were approved \n     unanimously last year by a Democratic-led Appropriations \n     Committee. Instead, the Republican-controlled conference \n     imposed an additional 0.65 percent across-the-board cut to \n     all federal programs, leaving already cash-strapped \n     initiatives in even greater need. The results of the \n     cumulative cuts, which total more than $4.4 billion, include:\n       First Responders: This bill cuts $2.98 billion from \n     activities designed to aid first responders. Cuts include a \n     $1.59 billion reduction for the Federal Emergency Management \n     Agency (FEMA)--including a $150 million cut to firefighter \n     grants--as well as a $235 million cut to funds for police and \n     firefighters to purchase communications equipment and a $155 \n     million cut to fund emergency operations centers.\n       Police/Law Enforcement: The bill reduces funding for \n     Community Oriented Policing (COPS) public safety and \n     community policing grants by more than 40 percent--from $330 \n     million to $200 million. This cut would completely eliminate \n     funding needed to hire 1,360 community-based police officers.\n       Aviation/Port Security: The bill cuts $170 million from \n     Transportation Security Administration (TSA), impeding \n     efforts to improve airport security, and cuts $46 million \n     from port security funds. The bill also makes cuts to the \n     U.S. Customs Service, resulting in the loss of more than 200 \n     employees and compromising the implementation of the \n     Container Security Initiative and other homeland security \n     efforts. The INS/border security budget is also reduced by \n     approximately $182 million.\n\n[[Page S2423]]\n\n       Other Cuts: The bill also cuts programs to train state and \n     federal law enforcement and security personnel by nearly $50 \n     million, including a $7 million cut to the Explosives \n     Training Initiative and $42 million to embassy security.\n       A supplemental appropriations bill would be necessary to \n     provide funding adequate to meet the homeland security needs \n     of localities across the country in advance of any military \n     action in Iraq.\n\n\n                                illinois\n\n       States and localities are still waiting for the funds \n     promised to them. The States have legitimate concerns. \n     There's a lot of brave talk about fighting terrorism, but \n     when it comes to paying for it, this administration has not \n     delivered.\n       In my home State of Illinois, we have an Illinois Terrorism \n     Task Force (TTF). This is a collective body representing 50 \n     agencies addressing emergency needs throughout the state of \n     Illinois. They have told me that a minimum of $100 million is \n     required to cover security expenses in Illinois for FY03.\n       The Terrorism Task Force originally asked for $320 million \n     in federal funding and then scaled back its request to the \n     current level ($100 million) in anticipation of federal \n     budget cuts.\n       According to the TTF director Mike Chamness, these funds \n     are crucial to Illinois' ability to properly address the \n     threat of terror.\n       Without these dollars, programs designed to secure Illinois \n     will cease to exist.\n       First responders will be ill-equipped and prepared to \n     address emergency situations.\n       Major items in the TFF's $100 million request include:\n       $25 million for first responders' respiration equipment \n     upgrade (nuclear, biological, and chemical).\n       $14.4 million for communication systems (interoperable \n     communications equipment for police, firefighters, and state/\n     local emergency operations centers).\n       Elite Terror Response Team: under current funding Federal \n     monies have not been available to send teams for the ``Elite \n     Response'' training.\n       It is imperative that my home state of Illinois--like every \n     other State in this nation--provides their front-line first \n     responders the best equipment, the essential tools, and the \n     finest training available. We rely on their readiness and \n     should expect nothing less. These funds are needed sooner, \n     not later.\n\n\n                            city of chicago\n\n       Now let me tell you about the funding needs for Homeland \n     Security in the City of Chicago.\n       The City of Chicago had made an assessment of total budget \n     needs for homeland security at around $175 million\n       The top ticket item in Chicago is the Chicago public safety \n     radio migration plan which is estimated to cost $80 million.\n       The migration allows for all agencies to communicate in an \n     interoperable manner on a daily basis without major equipment \n     modification or complicated system changes.\n       Among other important needs are:\n       Emergency Responder Training and Equipment--$7.9 million. \n     CPD is requesting first responder training, first responder \n     equipment and secondary responders unit training.\n       Emergency Operations Center Expansion--$10 million. This \n     expansion will provide incident manager with real-time live \n     video, satellite imagery, building X, Y, and Z coordinates \n     and other state of the art technologies.\n       Hazardous Materials Equipment--$7 million. The Chicago \n     Department of Environment is requesting hazardous materials \n     response equipment for any large, widespread or egregious \n     hazardous incident.\n\n\n             need to do much more than duct tape & plastic\n\n       We can't stand up and say we're truly doing everything we \n     can to ensure that our cities and counties, bridges and \n     roads, airplanes and trains are as secure as possible and \n     that our fellow Americans are safe on our soil if this bill \n     is what represents the level of our commitment to fund \n     programs to ensure homeland security.\n       I fully expect the President to come back to Congress and \n     ask for additional funds to support our military needs \n     overseas. Without question, we must address these needs. But \n     it would be unconscionable to increase funding for military \n     activities in Iraq and neglect our security needs at home. If \n     war comes with Iraq, the battle lines will be expanded to \n     include our country. We simply cannot afford to leave \n     American citizens unprotected.\n                                  ____\n\n\n ATF/Freedom of Information Act Provision (Re: City of Chicago Lawsuit \n                           vs. Gun Industry)\n\n       Another provision slipped in to the appropriations bill at \n     the last minute involves the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and \n     Firearms and the Freedom of Information Act.\n       This provision would be an enormous setback to the efforts \n     of state and local governments to combat illegal firearms \n     trafficking and would undermine the very purpose of the \n     Freedom of Information Act.\n       The Freedom of Information Act entitles citizens to open \n     access to government records and prevents the government from \n     shielding its activities from public scrutiny.\n       The City of Chicago filed a FOIA request to obtain \n     information from an ATF trace database. A U.S. District Court \n     and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit ordered \n     the ATF to release these records.\n       In response to these rulings, the gun industry went to the \n     House Appropriations Committee and asked for a rider to \n     prevent the ATF from complying with this FOIA request.\n       This provision sets a dangerous precedent because it \n     essentially directs a federal agency not to comply with a \n     federal court ruling, thus undermining the very purpose of \n     FOIA. If litigants can be denied information under FOIA \n     through legislative action--even when a federal court has \n     upheld the request--FOIA itself is in jeopardy.\n       There is no cost justification for this provision. The City \n     of Chicago demonstrated in its litigation that it would take \n     the ATF less than 10 minutes to assemble and release the data \n     is has requested.\n       I was joined by Senators Reed and Kennedy in urging that \n     this provision not be included, and I am disappointed that it \n     was.\n       In the past, I have challenged the Senate and the President \n     to back up the high priority we have placed on the global \n     AIDS pandemic with adequate resources.\n       [Senator DeWine has even called me a ``bull dog'' on this \n     issue. I took that as a great compliment.]\n       This 2003 appropriations process demonstrated that the \n     Senate does indeed recognize the need for increased resources \n     to fight global AIDS.\n       In December, I, and 15 other Senators, sent a letter to \n     appropriators asking them to increase overall AIDS spending \n     by 50 percent over 2002 levels. At the time we were looking \n     for an increase of $236 million.\n       While facing $9-$10 billion in cuts throughout the FY 2003 \n     appropriations bill, the Foreign Operations Subcommittee \n     responded to this request, and managed to find an additional \n     $41 million for global AIDS.\n       The Senate Labor, Health and Human Services Subcommittee \n     agreed to match House approved levels, increasing the funds \n     going to the CDC's Global AIDS Program by about $15 million.\n       While this increase of $56 million was welcome, \n     unfortunately, it was not enough.\n       Senator Mike DeWine and I set out to achieve that 50 \n     percent increase, and through a floor amendment to the \n     omnibus bill, sought another $180 million to bring overall \n     spending on Global AIDS to $1.525 billion.\n       This amendment was accepted--its success demonstrates the \n     Senate's sincere commitment to fighting global AIDS.\n       $100 million of these funds were slated for the U.S. \n     contribution to the Global Fund--the world's primary \n     organization to monitor and support worldwide AIDS \n     prevention, treatment and care programming.\n       And the remaining $80 million would go to USAID global AIDS \n     programs.\n       Well, during conference, we lost $80 million of the $180 \n     million total. But, nevertheless, I count this as a victory \n     for the global AIDS pandemic.\n       In the end, an additional $50 million was secured for the \n     Global Fund, bringing the U.S. contribution up to $350 \n     million for 2003, and an additional $50 million went to \n     bilateral programs.\n       This omnibus bill designates $1.2 billion for global AIDS. \n     That is a 46 percent increase over what Congress appropriated \n     in 2002.\n       The President's 2003 budget request suggested an increase \n     in funding of global AIDS funding of 29 percent. I would say \n     we have come a long way.\n       We will need this type of increase--at least a 50 percent \n     increase--each year until we can close the gap between \n     expenditures and resources necessary to fight this pandemic.\n       The President's FY04 budget request amounts to an increase \n     of only 32 percent over the $1.4 billion the U.S. will spend \n     overall on global AIDS in 2003.\n       [This bull dog] I will be back, asking that at a minimum we \n     achieve a 50 percent increase in global AIDS funding each \n     year for the next few years.\n       We must continue to do more for the 42 million people \n     worldwide who are living with HIV/AIDS and prevent a good \n     portion of those that will become newly infected in 2003.\n       During the last ten minutes I have been speaking, \n     approximately 58 people have died from AIDS, 11 of those were \n     children.\n       A 15-year-old boy in Botswana faces an 80 percent chance of \n     dying of AIDS.\n       By 2010, it is estimated that sub-Saharan Africa alone will \n     be home to 20 million AIDS orphans; that's 20 million \n     children who have lost one or both parents due to AIDS.\n       We must act now to help those who today suffer from the \n     impact of HIV/AIDS as well as to change the future of today's \n     children.\n       We know the situation is dire. We have data to support what \n     program work. Now its time to fund the programs that work.\n       The 2003 appropriations bill helps us to take yet another \n     tiny step forward in fighting global AIDS.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Mr. President, it has been very interesting to me to \nreview the budget document that is now before us that has the omnibus \nappropriations for 2003, which provides funding for all the \ndiscretionary programs and activities outside the Department of \nDefense.\n  For months last year, our Republican colleagues prevented completion \nof the remaining 2003 appropriations bills, arguing that that level for \nappropriations was too high and the President would not accept \nappropriations bills that exceeded $750.5 billion in total.\n  The President's veto threat persisted even with the Senate \nAppropriations Committee having voted out all 13 appropriations bills \non unanimous 29-to-0 votes.\n  After delaying the 2003 appropriations process for 5 months, and \nforcing most of the Federal Government to operate under a series of \ncontinuing resolutions, our Republican colleagues have produced a bill \nthat, when combined with the already enacted defense and military \nconstruction bills, exceeds the President's level by more than $12 \nbillion.\n  Republicans provide total discretionary budget authority for 2003 of \n$762.7 billion, and highway obligational authority of $31.8 billion, \nfor a total of $794.5 billion.\n  Last year, they railed against the Senate Budget Committee reported \nspending level of $797 billion.\n  My friends, that is a difference of three-tenths of 1 percent, a $2.5 \nbillion difference. Five months of delay over a difference of three-\ntenths of 1 percent. Levels they said were fiscally irresponsible they \nhave now adopted.\n  Most interesting--most interesting--when the bill was here on the \nfloor, some of our colleagues on the other side ran up a debt meter on \namendments offered by some Democrats that had a total cost over 10 \nyears of $37 billion.\n  We are poised to vote now on their proposal which is $62 billion \nabove what was offered on the floor at the time. So if they still have \ntheir debt meter chart, they had better get it out. And they ought to \nput another $25 billion on their tote board because they are running up \nthe debt--and it is their spending. They are in charge, and all their \ntalk about Democratic spending, and that that is the problem with \nfiscal responsibility, is shown for what it was. It was all talk.\n  The reason we are in the deficit ditch is the tax cuts that were \nunaffordable that they have put in place and the additional tax cuts \nthis President is seeking that are going to drive us deep into deficit \nand debt.\n  Mr. President, the numbers do not lie. I have been waiting for this \nmoment for 5 months, to see if the rhetoric matched the reality. And \nnow we see. In just a few moments we are going to have a chance to \nvote, and then we are going to see who stands with their words, and who \nstands with their rhetoric, and who votes to spend the money.\n  This has been a very interesting year, but this is just the \nbeginning. Because we are going to see, in the coming months, who is \nserious about fiscal responsibility, who is serious about having \nbudgets that add up, who is serious about paying down debt, who is \nserious about exploding deficits and debt--right on the eve of the \nretirement of the baby boom generation. I hope very much that the \nrhetoric matches the reality because we have not seen that in the last \n5 months.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to address the issue of our fiscal \nyear 2003 omnibus appropriations conference report.\n  Let me begin by, first of all, commending Senator Stevens and Senator \nByrd. Conferencing these bills is no easy task. Each of us has pieces \nof these bills that we care about deeply. And the Chair and Ranking \nMember have the awesome responsibility of trying to pull all of this \ntogether.\n  Although I am disappointed by many parts of the conference report, I \nalso want to begin by paying tribute to the chairman and the ranking \nmember and their staffs for the tremendous effort they put into this \nbill and to try to accommodate the many requests they received and the \ntremendous demands made of them.\n  Certainly, in many respects this bill is an improvement over the \nbudget that was submitted to us by the President. Unfortunately, that \nis not a very high standard, by this Senator's calculation.\n  The standard that we must meet in each year's appropriations is to \naddress the needs of the American people. Unfortunately, this bill \nneither reflects the priorities of the American people, nor does it do \nnearly enough to address our national needs.\n  I will begin by discussing education. There are many other parts to \nthis bill, but education is a particular priority and source of debate \nand contention for the American public. Regardless of where you live, \nany constituency will tell you that one of their major concerns is the \nquality of our public education at the elementary, secondary, and \nhigher education levels. It is critically important when you consider \nhow significant this is to the American public that this bill should \nreflect to the greatest extent possible the interests of the American \npeople in improving the quality of education.\n  I thank the committee for something they did in the bill on \neducation, instead of just sounding like a critic on everything. We \nexempted under this bill, thanks to the leadership of Senator Stevens \nand others, Head Start from the across-the-board cuts. I am grateful to \nthem for that. That is going to make a difference to a lot of kids in \nthe country who count on Head Start. I thank him and his staff for \ndoing that for these young people. That would have lost somewhere \naround 12- to 22,000 kids, had we applied the across-the-board cut to \nthe existing funds on Head Start. We serve thousands more than that, \nabout 800,000, but 22,000 kids being dropped off the rolls of Head \nStart would have been a great tragedy. I thank them for that.\n  Again, I thank my colleague from Alaska on special education. He \nmanaged to work out a way with me, at least coming out of this Chamber, \nto put an additional $1.5 billion into special education, which would \nhave been a major step forward. It would not have gotten us to the 40 \npercent that ultimately we will have to reach, but it would have taken \nus a substantial part of the way down that road.\n  The Senator from Alaska can't win every battle, but I would be remiss \nif I\n\n[[Page S2425]]\n\ndid not report to my colleagues that in this conference report, instead \nof coming back with that $1.5 billion, we are coming back with $400 \nmillion. We lost $1.1 billion when the House and the conferees from \nthis body met to work out the differences.\n  This is such a priority. I don't care where you go in the country. \nFor every county, every community, this is a major issue. It is a major \nfiscal responsibility. Local governments don't get to do the things we \ndo at the national level or the State level. They have to meet these \nresponsibilities. We have mandated it; we have required it. So whether \nyou live in the great State of Colorado, as the Presiding Officer does, \nor the State of Connecticut, I will guarantee you, if you were to ask \nlocal people what are some of the priorities you have, this is one that \nwould always come up.\n  I am very disappointed, despite the efforts of Senator Stevens and \nothers, that apparently the House leadership did not see the wisdom of \nmaintaining the $1.5 billion. They cut it by $1.1 billion so we get a \n$400 million increase over the President's budget. You could argue that \nis certainly an improvement but still far short of what I had hoped we \nwould be able to do.\n\n  I wish to address the issue of title I. That was a source of lengthy \ndebate in this Chamber during consideration of the legislation. Senator \nKennedy of Massachusetts offered an amendment to try to make up the \nshortfall between what the President's budget submitted on title I \nfunding and what would have been needed in order to meet the promise \nthe President and the Congress made last year when the President signed \nthe No Child Left Behind Act. How many times have you heard people talk \nabout this bill, the importance of title I, getting resources to these \nchildren and their families, those who are in the poorest conditions in \nboth rural and urban communities?\n  We all signed on to the bill, which, by the way, if you are troubled \nby special education because of a mandate from the Federal Government, \nbrace yourselves because the No Child Left Behind Act has significant \nmandates in it. We require localities to do many things under title I. \nIt is going to be costly to do them, including mandatory testing. But \ninstead of providing the resources in the first year of this new \nElementary and Secondary Education Act, the President actually came \nback and sought to reduce the funding dedicated to meet those \ncommitments.\n  The difference in the conference report between the promise and the \nreality is $4.25 billion rather than $4.65 billion. So coming back from \nconference the disparity is not quite as bad as it was, but the fact \nis, $4.3 billion was still missing for title I. I am terribly saddened \nby that.\n  I know how hard the conferees have to work, but you can't mandate \nthings on local governments and not be willing to come up with the \nresources. If you are going to vote as we did overwhelmingly for the No \nChild Left Behind Act and then within the same calendar year refuse to \nprovide funding for it, well, you get some sense of why there is so \nmuch outrage at the local level. You are seeing it in special \neducation. Now you will see it in title I. That is regrettable. But, \nagain, I thank the Members for their efforts and what they have done in \nthis area.\n  Lastly, on higher education, when the bill left the Senate, it had \nincreased Pell grants by $100 a student. Since the purchasing power of \nPell grants has been cut in half since 1975 and in most cases the \naverage student loan indebtedness has tripled since 1987, I didn't \nthink that was nearly enough. Our Republican colleagues defeated an \namendment to increase the grant by $400, but we sent over at least \n$100. Now it is coming back with an increase of $50. I don't need to \ntell you wherever you go, whether it is special education, title I, or \ncollege education, the idea that a $50 increase in a Pell grant is \ngoing to make much of a difference for these low-to-moderate income \nfamilies who are trying to meet the cost of higher education, just \ndoesn't make sense.\n  Again, I understand that conferees must establish priorities. But I \nam deeply saddened that we couldn't do better and hold at least to the \n$100 that we had in the Senate bill and try to at least relieve a small \namount of that additional burden that these families are going to face.\n  Just to put this all in perspective, I know there is divided opinion \non these issues, but these are about priorities. The President has \nplaced a very high priority obviously on the $674 billion tax cut; $320 \nbillion of which will go to the wealthiest 5 percent of Americans. \nThink of that. Here you have a tax cut for the top 5 percent that is \ngoing to be some 75 times larger than the cost of meeting the promise \nto low-income schools, and apparently the President values that tax cut \nabout 230 times more than increasing Pell grants for low-income \nstudents by $400.\n  Those are choices. I understand people make them. But the American \npublic has a right to know that when the choice came to doing something \nabout Pell grants for struggling families, working families, doing \nsomething about special education needs for our local communities, or \ndoing something about title I funds which are critically important to \nimprove the quality of education at the elementary school level, we \nmade the choice to provide tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans.\n  I represent the most affluent State in te country. I probably have a \nlarger percentage of constituents who would benefit from this tax cut \nproposal than most other States. Yet I can tell you, there are very few \nwho believe these kinds of priorities are their priorities. Most of \nthem, in fact, based on what I have heard from them, believe we should \nbe making these critical investments in the quality of education in our \ncountry--special education, title I funding, and Pell grants.\n  I am glad the conference report retained the language from my \namendment approved on the Senate floor to exempt Head Start from any \nacross the board cut contained in the bill. Head Start reaches only 60 \npercent of eligible 3- and 4-year-olds and only 3 percent of eligible \ninfants and toddlers. The conference report provides a modest increase \nfor Head Start that will barely cover inflation. While it is good that \nHead Start was not subject to an across the board cut and was allowed a \nmodest increase, we should be fully funding the program. If we truly \nwant to leave no child behind, then we need to ensure that every child \nstarts school ready to learn. This would have been a good opportunity \nto expand Head Start, but instead, we are just holding it harmless. \nThat's not good enough.\n  And, while the omnibus legislation continues to provide funding for a \nrange of programs critical to the public health of our Nation, it falls \nfar short of meeting the true healthcare needs of American citizens. \nWhen this bill was before the Senate, I was pleased to support \namendments offered by Senator Murray and Mikulski that were adopted and \nwill support care for the uninsured and nurse training. I am pleased \nthat the conference agreement supports lifesaving research conducted by \nthe National Institutes of Health and removes a scheduled reimbursement \nreduction for physicians that treat elderly Medicare beneficiaries. \nHowever, I am disappointed that this agreement fails to sufficiently \nbroaden further many of the health provisions contained within the \noriginal bill. Amendments regrettably rejected by the Senate during \nconsideration of this measure include an amendment offered by Senator \nKennedy that would have provided more than $500 million to public \nhealth programs that serve minority communities and an amendment \noffered by Senator Clinton that would have bolstered funding to \nMedicare providers service elderly Americans by more than $4 billion.\n  Because more than 130 million Americans continue to breathe unhealthy \nair, I believe the President's proposal to eliminate protections that \ncontrol pollution from powerplants and other industries is unwise. I \nsupported Senator Edwards' amendment during Senate debate called for an \nindependent, scientific analysis of the regulations before they go into \neffect. Unfortunately, this amendment was defeated. Language was added \nin conference to allow more logging for commercial purposes and prevent \nlegal challenges to the 1997 Tongass forest management plan.\n  Further, at a time when energy markets are so volatile, when heating \noil inventories in the Northeast are 35 percent below the 10-year \naverage, when crude oil is at $35 per barrel, and when\n\n[[Page S2426]]\n\nthe Northeast is experiencing an unusually cold winter, this bill cuts \nfunding for the Northeast Heating Oil Reserve from $8 million to $6 \nmillion.\n  Under the cuts imposed by the administration and the majority here in \nCongress, the Department of Housing and Urban Development will provide \nhousing services to fewer families and communities will suffer. These \ncuts come on top of HUD's recently announced plans to cut its operating \nsupport for public housing authorities by as much as 30 percent. In \nletters to the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, I have urged \nthe administration to work with Congress to meet the Nation's housing \npriorities. Unfortunately, this appropriations bill is simply not \nadequate.\n  I am also disappointed that this legislation cuts funding for the \nFederal FIRE grant initiative from $900 million in the previously \napproved Senate bill to $750 million in this final bill. FIRE grants \nprovide local firefighters with absolutely essential equipment and \ntraining. I firmly believe the FIRE grant program should have been \nfully funded. Now more than ever, the Federal Government should be \nstriving to be an effective partner with cities and towns across the \ncountry.\n\n  Unfortunately, this final bill reduced funding not only for the FIRE \ngrants, but for a myriad of other homeland security activities. In \ntotal, this final omnibus bill cuts nearly $4.5 billion in homeland \nsecurity spending from the fiscal year 2003 bills written by the Senate \nAppropriations Committee last year. Homeland security spending was cut \nin order to stay within the President's spending limits--limits that \nwere imposed not because domestic spending is out of control, but \nbecause we have cut tax revenue irresponsibly. At a time when the \nFederal Government is running record deficits, we are being asked to \neconomize on the safety of local law enforcement, firefighters, \nemergency medical technicians, and the public.\n  This bill also fails to provide adequate funding to help state and \nlocal governments improve their election and balloting systems. The \nconference report provides $1.5 billion for election and balloting \nmodernization. This is a significant first step, but it is \nsubstantially below the amount authorized in the Help America Vote Act. \nI am concerned that state and local governments will not have the \nresources they need to prepare for the upcoming election and ensure \nthat we do not have a repeat of the 2000 Presidential election fiasco. \nI am hopeful that we will find the additional resources necessary to \nmake sure that every vote is accurately counted. I hope we will find \nthe additional resources at the earliest opportunity.\n  In the end, I believe this bill reflects a very troubling attitude \nthat seems to be taking hold here in Washington, which is to talk about \nhelping working families, improving healthcare and education, keeping \nour homeland safe, and other priorities, but not to do enough follow-\nthrough. The American people deserve better than that.\n  Again, I thank my colleague from Alaska. He fought hard on some of \nthese issues. Unfortunately, we were not able to prevail as \nsuccessfully as I hoped we could. But, I thank him publicly for his \nefforts, and I regret deeply we could not have held onto the Senate \nprovisions during the conference negotiations.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Connecticut for \nhis nice comments. I can only say I regret deeply that I will not have \nthe privilege he will have tonight, to go home to that beautiful young \nchild. We know he protects children because of his great interest in \nchildren at this time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

God \nforbid. We have shorted homeland security in this bill. We have shorted \nport security as it relates to inspecting containers at the ports. We \nhave shorted border security, firefighter grants, community policing \ngrants; and in education, we are leaving many children behind. That \nbreaks a promise to them.\n  To me, this bill is wanting in many ways. In the area of the \nenvironment, which I will talk about, brownfield cleanups have been \nreduced, and the meaning of organic meat has been turned on its head.\n  It breaks my heart to tell the Senate tonight that I think America's \nforests are under major attack. It is unbelievable to me that without \nany debate or discussion, a pilot program has been expanded massively \nand, in my opinion, it is going to lead to the ruination of our \nnational forests--our forests that belong to the American people. The \nprogram I am talking about is called the Forest Stewardship Program, \nwhich started 3 years ago. The idea was to allow limited logging on \nnational forest land for the purpose of maintaining healthy forests in \naccordance with the forest management plan. Now, as I said, this \nprogram has been massively extended.\n\n[[Page S2427]]\n\n  Let me tell you why I think this stewardship project that is in the \nbill is an attack on American values. I know the hour is late and I do \nnot intend to take a lot of time tonight. But when riders are placed \ninto a bill as massive as this, I can tell you, when the American \npeople wake up in the morning and learn they are going to lose a lot of \nthe old growth trees in this beautiful land of ours, they are not going \nto be happy.\n  I think America's forests belong to the people and I don't like to \nsee a giveaway of taxpayer property. I don't like to see an open \ninvitation to destroy our forests. I don't like to see no limits at all \non old growth trees. Timber companies will now pick the trees they \nwant, with no veto from the Forest Service on these projects. This also \napplies to BLM lands. We could see 70 million acres of national forest \nland open to logging here. That would also include 10 million acres in \nmy home State of California and millions and millions of acres of BLM \nland.\n  In my opinion, the very purpose of this rider is it tries to overrule \nforest land management plans. I argue that the forest land management \nplans take precedence. But I can assure you, they are going to start \nthese projects. I only hope, since the only way this could be stopped \nis in court, that it will be stopped in court. There are limits on \npublic participation in these projects.\n  Let me show you what they did in the dead of night, if I might say, \nwithout anyone watching, without any debate, without any discussion, \nwithout any public participation. I don't know that anybody can read \nthis chart, but I am going to go through it.\n  Under current law, we see that 70 million of 191 million acres of \nnational forests and grasslands are affected.\n  Under this omnibus bill, we would see the same number of acres \naffected, plus 200 million acres of 260 million acres of BLM land. We \nare talking about massive amounts of land.\n  The number of projects now under the Stewardship Program number 28 \nprojects a year. Now there is no limit, no limit at all.\n  Who is in charge of the projects? Now under the Stewardship Program, \nit is the Forest Service. They come in and they will tell a private \nsector commercial logger: This is what you can cut, but do not cut this \ntree down and do not cut that tree down because they may be old growth, \nor whatever, for whatever reason. Now we give it away to the timber \ncompanies.\n  We are seeing in the red the differences between the current projects \nwhere they were limited to 28 projects a year to no limit.\n  Let me say to my friends in California who may be watching this \ndebate tonight, 10 million of our 20 million acres of national forests \nthat we love in our State could be under the ax here. I hope you wake \nup to this because this was done in the dead of night.\n  There are, under current law, many reasons we allow logging on these \n28 projects a year: soil productivity, watershed restoration. There are \nmany reasons why today in these pilot projects you can log. It is very \ncarefully controlled. Mostly it is to reduce fire hazards, promote \nhealthy forest standards, road and trail maintenance, grading a road to \nmaintain a camp site. These are all allowable in this small number of \npilot projects. This is what has been added.\n  Now after the Forest Service turns over this particular part of the \nforest to a commercial logger, they can actually log for commercial \npurposes, such as providing wood to lumber mills.\n  Let me explain this. Where we had a project before that was aimed at \nkeeping the forest healthy, it has been turned on its head, and now it \nsays we are going to turn it over to the commercial loggers. The Forest \nService cannot even have any say in it. It is completely up to the \ncommercial loggers what trees they will cut down. Building a new road \nis allowed, not just maintaining a road.\n  I am stunned, frankly, that this could happen in a conference without \none word of debate. This is a shock to anyone in this country who \nbelieves the national forests belong to the people of our country \nbecause this is--and I will put this back again to say in summary how I \nfeel about it--this is an attack on American values. We all know that \nour precious environment is just that. We see a giveaway of taxpayer \nproperty. Not one slim dime will come into the Treasury; not one slim \ndime.\n  We have an open invitation to destroy our forests without getting \nanything back for it. There are no limits on old-growth forest logging. \nTimber companies will pick the trees they want with no veto from the \nForest Service, a complete change from what we have had before. We \ncould impact 70 million acres of national forest lands, including 10 \nmillion acres in my home State of California and millions of acres of \nBLM land.\n  This is clearly an attempt--I underscore--an attempt to overrule \nforest land management plans, an attempt I hope will not succeed.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to ask the Senator a question. I have only \nbeen in the Senate 6 years. She has been here slightly longer. Isn't it \ncurious some of the worst environmental provisions are included in the \nappropriations bill at the last minute without any hearing, without any \nreview? One would think that the people who were supporting this--the \ntimber industry and those who support these provisions--would not be so \nafraid of their positions that they have to put them in a stealthy \nsituation where, frankly, it is a ``take it or leave it'' bill, a \n``take it or leave it'' 2,000-page bill that includes this rider.\n  If I understand what the Senator has said, this provision, so-called \nstewardship contract, could open more than 70 million acres of national \nforest currently owned by the taxpayers of America to logging by \nprivate companies, and that until this time, we only allowed them to \ntest this in 28 different projects, and only 10 of those projects have \nactually been activated and tested. So it is an untested theory which \nthe logging industry, the timber industry has now tried to capitalize \non with this anti-environment rider to open up more than 70 million \nacres to logging; is that the situation?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to my friend, he is right, but there is more. For \nthe first time they have now opened up BLM land as well; that is, 200 \nmillion acres of the Nation's 260 million acres of BLM land is also \nopened, and we are talking about no limit on the number of projects.\n  Under the current law, it is 28 projects a year. It is extraordinary. \nWho is in charge? As my friend points out, the timber companies.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I may ask my friend from California, I am sure she has \nread this, but the Los Angeles Times editorial said it best today:\n\n       Since the days of Teddy Roosevelt, Forest Service \n     responsibility has been to manage the forests on behalf of \n     all Americans, not to make sure the lumber mills grind out as \n     many board feet as the world wants to buy.\n\n  That is from the L.A. Times editorial today.\n  It seems from what I can gather that many who support this provision \nbelieve these national treasures, these national forests are there for \nthe exploitation of private companies rather than the legacy which we \nowe to our children and future generations.\n  To allow these companies to come in and run roughshod over millions \nof acres of America's national forest land for their own profit and to \ndo this at the last minute in an anti-environment rider strikes me as a \nharsh commentary on the values that this Senate is putting in this bill \nfor the appropriations process.\n  I salute the Senator from California. Thank you for having the \npolitical courage to stand up and make a point about an issue that \nreally is going to have an impact on America for generations to come.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend very much. I know my time is running \nshort. There is nothing I can do here except take a few minutes to call \nthis to the attention of my colleagues and the American people because, \nas my colleague knows, we cannot amend this report. It is up or down. \nThis is what makes it so egregious to me.\n  I am ready to go to battle toe to toe any day on this issue, and I am \nsure my colleagues would give me a fight on it. We would have a vote \nand take our lumps if we lost and be very happy if we won.\n  We have a situation where taxpayer property is being given away \nwithout 1\n\n[[Page S2428]]\n\ncent back to the Treasury. Here we have a situation where, instead of \nthe Forest Service saying, OK, you can cut down a few of these trees, \nwe need it for certain public purposes, they are out of the game. They \ngive it to the logger, and the logger decides what tree to cut down.\n  I think this is a stunning reversal of a program that started out to \nbe one that was in the public interest.\n  In closing, I will give you one last example.\n  Under this new rule--and, again, I apologize for the crudeness of \nthese charts, but we did not know about this until a few hours ago. It \nis now a stewardship goal, if the Forest Service so states, to provide \nwood to lumber mills. That becomes a forest stewardship goal. It is \nunreal.\n  Our people think we are protecting our forests, but our new goal is \nto invite the loggers in, with no limits on these projects. I am \ndistraught and disturbed about this. I only hope that the courts will \ndo what they have done in the past and say this is in violation of the \nforest plans. Maybe they will save us from ourselves. This is \nmiserable.\n  I wish I could offer an amendment to strip this out. I am prohibited \nfrom doing it, but I will bring this back to my colleagues at a time \nwhen we have more opportunity to discuss it in detail.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/13/senate-section/article/S2428-1", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2428-S2439]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    MAKING FURTHER CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003--\n                           CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nconsider the conference report to accompany H.J. Res. 2 under the \nprevious agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk will report the \nconference report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the joint \n     resolution (H.J. Res. 2) making further continuing \n     appropriations for the fiscal year 2003, and for other \n     purposes, having met have agreed that the House recede from \n     its disagreement to the amendment of the Senate and agree to \n     the same with an amendment and the Senate agree to the same, \n     signed by a majority of the conferees on the part of both \n     Houses.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will proceed to the consideration \nof the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of February 13, 2003.)\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this is probably a historic occasion \nbecause we are presenting to the Senate--as my colleague, Chairman Bill \nYoung, presented to the House--11 appropriations bills in one omnibus \nbill, a bill that covers the balance of this fiscal year, fiscal year \n2003.\n  We are in this position because of considerations of the last \nCongress. I will not take the time of the Senate to try to discuss why \nwe did not pass those bills last year, but when we commenced this year \nand I became chairman of the Appropriations Committee once again, it \nwas my determination that we should proceed with those bills and make \nsure we had them completed and to the President for his signature \nbefore we were forced to enter into the budget process for fiscal year \n2004.\n  It was a very difficult process. I want to thank my good friend and \nChairman Bill Young in the House, who did as we requested to get the \nSenate to adopt two continuing resolutions. One we passed and it has \nextended the time for consideration of these bills. That time will \nexpire on February 20. We will soon get another continuing resolution \nto take us over to, I believe, February 24, so the President will have \na chance to review these bills before he must sign them. I do believe \nthe President will sign this bill when it is received by him.\n  It was early this morning that the conference report on H.J. Res. 2 \nwas filed in the House. I was discussing with other Members of Congress \nas early as 2 a.m. this morning some of the provisions of this bill. It \nis a very controversial bill, I know. There are many portions of this \nbill that if I were alone and had the sole right to write the bill, I \nwould not incorporate in this bill. This bill includes 11 separate \nappropriations bills. The conference report includes 16 divisions. It \nis a long bill.\n  I see my friend from Arizona in the Chamber. I acknowledge it is a \nvery difficult bill to go through in a very short period of time. I \nappreciate the consideration he and his staff are giving to the bill, \nas he usually gives to our appropriations bills.\n  I see my colleague from West Virginia is in the Chamber, and when he \nis ready we will ask that the Senate turn to the consideration of the \nbill. I want to talk about some of the background of the bill before we \nbegin making statements on the bill and what is in it.\n  This has been a very difficult process for all of us. I want to say \nto the Senate that following the election, I outlined to our staff, and \nour staff director Steve Cortese, a process I hoped we would follow to \nget these bills passed. The Senate Appropriations Committee staff has \nbeen working on these 11 separate bills since the end of the year. We \nhave had bipartisan cooperation. The process we followed in the Senate \nwas that we had 11 teams. They were made up of the 11 subcommittees \nthat would have handled the bills had they been handled individually. \nThese bills were primarily the result of the interaction of the staff \ndirector of each of those subcommittees with the staff and the \nmembership of the subcommittee.\n  We took the product of those 11 teams and put them together into the \nomnibus amendment I offered to H.J. Res. 2, the one that was brought \nbefore the Senate. I might add that in addition, the conference report \ncontains $10 billion in addition to the funds for the Department of \nDefense and intelligence community for the global war on terrorism. \nThese were added to the bill. This was a reserve that was set aside by \nmy great friend from West Virginia when he was chairman, a reserve for \nDefense pursuant to the request of the President as he presented the \nbudget for the fiscal year 2003.\n  It would be my intention to ask the Senate to proceed with statements \npertaining to H.J. Res. 2 before it is actually received, before we go \non the bill. I hope that meets with everyone's approval. Right now it \nis a matter of discussing the various provisions of the bill.\n  There are several other legislative initiatives in the bill. They \ninclude $3.1 billion for drought and other agricultural disasters. \nThese funds are offset by reductions in mandatory programs. Medicare \nand the TANF short-term extensions would give the Finance Committee \ntime to address their matters in a reconciliation bill later this year. \nThere is a .65 percent across-the-board cut to all discretionary \naccounts in this bill to assure that the total remains within the top \nline that was agreed to by myself, House Chairman Bill Young, and the \nPresident. That is a an arbitrary line, I will admit, but in order to \nget the bill signed, if we joined them together, it was my judgment we \ncould not risk a final veto from the President of the United States \nafter working so hard to put them all through in one package. So we \nhave worked as closely as possible with all concerned to try and make \ncertain that the bills will be in a form the President could sign it.\n  I have to admit I am sure he will be as disturbed about some of the \nprovisions as I am myself, but I do believe all in all the bill is one \nthe President should be able to sign because we have kept the \nagreement. We have stayed within the line of the requests made by the \nPresident of the United States for funds for fiscal year 2003.\n  I will take a moment to address the total spending levels in the \nbill. Last November, Chairman Bill Young and I met with the President \nto discuss how we might complete the work on these fiscal year 2003 \nbills. At that time, the President asked that we would hold to the \ntotal provided in his budget request, as amended by him. We asked that \nfunds needed for the western firefighting be added to that total to \naddress that emergency. We also agreed at that time there would be no \nemergency money per se--no amounts added to the bill above the \nPresident's request. The President agreed to our request that he would \nsend in a supplemental request for the monies needed for the western \nfires.\n  In addition, we discussed the need to fund the election reform bill \nenacted\n\n[[Page S2429]]\n\nby the last Congress and respond to the severe drought facing \nMidwestern and Western States.\n  To accommodate all these competing pressures, the bill I presented to \nthe Senate in the form of an amendment to the second continuing \nresolution sent to the House included a 1.6 percent across-the-board \ncut to ensure the total spending did not exceed the new total we then \nfaced, which was $751.325 billion.\n  During consideration by the Senate, amendments were adopted that \nnecessitated increasing that across-the-board cut to 2.85 percent of \nthe total of the bill. That level could not be sustained, and it became \na driving factor in our conference with the House and with the \nadministration. We understood that as we went to conference. We took \nthose across-the-board cuts so in conference we could discuss all the \nprograms with the House and with the administration and work out an \nacceptable compromise.\n  The challenge facing the conferees was to integrate all the \npriorities of both the Houses and the administration within the top \nline of the total requested by the President of the United States. Each \nof the subcommittee chairmen and ranking members managed to negotiate \nto resolve their portion of the bill. In other words, as they got to \nconference, the 11 teams were still involved with working primarily \nwith their portion of this bill. Both the House and the Senate worked \nto accommodate a set of allocations that would ensure we stay within \nour fiscal goals.\n  By allocations, I mean the amount of money available to each \nsubcommittee for the portion of this bill and the portion of the budget \nthat pertained to matters under their jurisdiction.\n  During the course of these negotiations, we turned on several \noccasions to the Vice President for his counsel, consideration, and \nleadership in bridging the gaps between the Congress and the \nadministration. This has been one of the most interesting periods of my \nlife as a Senator, being able to work this closely with the Vice \nPresident, who undertook, despite the problems facing the Nation, to \ngive us his attention whenever I called and whatever time I called. In \nevery case, the Vice President worked hard with us to find solutions to \nthe problems that beset this conference.\n  The conference report, based on the give and take between the House \nand the Senate, between the Congress and the White House, meets the \nfiscal targets agreed to by both the House and the Senate. \nDiscretionary spending for fiscal year 2003 will be a total now of \n$762.713 billion. That total reflects our original base of $751.325 \nbillion, in addition to $1.5 billion for election reform, which the \nPresident endorsed over the base request, and the $10 billion for the \ndefense reserve.\n  The White House also accepted $2.241 billion in advance \nappropriations for the 2004 education programs, which was an initiative \nwe began on the floor as we tried to increase the moneys allocated to \neducation under the President's No Child Left Behind education program.\n  In short, we set a target which was the total amount requested by the \nadministration. We met the target and we bring this bill to the Senate, \nreflecting the priorities of the administration, the House, and the \nSenate. A great deal of hard work went into this final agreement, with \nall parties making compromises--and, I must say, sacrifices--to get the \njob done.\n  On my own account, as I mentioned earlier today, I was disappointed \nthat a more complete resolution of the Alaska timber problem could not \nbe included in this bill. There have been comments made about my trying \nto add something behind the scenes and some sort of dark way of moving \nan amendment that should not have been considered by the conference. \nThere was a provision in this bill as it went to conference dealing \nwith the Tongass Forest in Alaska. We tried to resolve the total \ndispute over that forest. That has not been possible. As I said this \nafternoon, I will address the Senate again and again and again until it \nis resolved.\n  At the conference meeting, I was compelled to ask Senator Bond to \nwithhold a more comprehensive proposal on the Missouri River, a goal he \nhas sought, and sought very hard, and on which he has worked very hard. \nI know it was a very difficult thing for my great friend from Missouri.\n  The House advocated language on coal company compensation that the \nSenate could not agree to. The House also accepted compromises on \nAmtrak from the positions advocated by the subcommittee chairman.\n  The toughest portion to resolve was the drought relief package. I am \ndeeply grateful to the efforts and leadership of Senator Cochran in \nresolving this matter and meeting the needs of those farmers devastated \nby recent droughts. His joint role as chairman of the agriculture \nsubcommittee and the authorizing committee made him a pivotal figure in \nthis process and brought before the Senate a proposal which I hope will \nbe acceptable to all involved in farm matters.\n  I know many others wish to speak at this conference report, and I \nwill reserve any time that might be allocated to me. I thank the \ndistinguished ranking member and our former chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, Senator Byrd, for his partnership and \nassistance in preparing this bill for the Senate. I know he did not \nagree with the process. I know he wished we had more time to deal with \nthese individuals bills. But without the work undertaken by Senator \nByrd in the committee, reporting all the 13 bills last year, we could \nnot have completed our work under the timetable we faced. It was \nbecause of the work he led last year that gave us the ability to deal \nwith 11 different bills that had a prior approval by the Senate and \npast Congress and gave a jumping off point to play catchup with this \nprocess.\n\n  I have the deepest respect for the House chairman, Congressman Young, \nand the ranking member, Congressman Obey. Their constructive approach \nand determination to finish the work, these 2003 bills, were vital to \nthe conclusion of this conference.\n  It is with a great deal of humbleness that I come before the Senate \nand ask the Senate to approve this conference report because I know it \nis a difficult process. We will approve the largest appropriations bill \nin the history of the United States because there are 11 together in \none package. It is very difficult. There will be portions of this bill \nwith which some people disagree; they could disagree with 1 and love \nthe other 10.\n  But the process here is such that if we are to do our work for the \nremainder of this year, if we are going to be able to address the year \n2004 appropriations bills, if we are going to be prepared to deal with \nthe possibility of a supplemental for our men and women in uniform who \nare being deployed throughout the world, if we are going to be able to \nbe partners with the administration in dealing with the crises that \nface this country in Iraq and Korea, we have to clear this deck.\n  We have to make up our mind to vote for this bill. I urge every \nMember to search his or her soul about this process. It is not a \nperfect process. It is absolutely not perfect. This bill is certainly \nfar from perfect, but it is the best we can do under the circumstances \nthat face us. There are many people here disappointed, as I am, about \nprovisions that affect their own personal State. All I can say is, \nthere will be another day and perhaps we can address some of those \nprovisions on an individual basis as the year goes by.\n  I deeply thank the staff of the Appropriations Committee on a \nbipartisan basis. I will later ask to put all their names in the Record \nbecause every one of them has been involved. My staff director sent me \nan e-mail last night at 2:45. I am surprised he thought I was still \nawake to get it--but I was. But the real problem is this has been a \nproduct of hard labor. I hope the Senate realizes that as we proceed \ntonight.\n  It is my deep hope that we will vote on this bill tonight because it \nwill add 1 more day to the time that the President has to review the \nbill. It will take at least 2 days, maybe 3 days, for the enrolling \nprocess of this bill to take place. In all probability the President \ncannot receive this bill, if we pass it tonight, until Monday night or \nTuesday of next week. He is entitled the time to review this; all of \nthe staff have to review this before he will sign it.\n  Having been part of the administration one time, I know what they \ncall the ``enrolled bill process'' in the administration. Each \ndepartment gets its\n\n[[Page S2430]]\n\ntime to review a bill passed by the Congress and present their \nrecommendations to the Office of Management and Budget to be put \ntogether and given to the President for his consideration before he \nwill sign a bill. That process must have time. We should accord the \nPresident of the United States the respect due his office, to give him \ntime to review this bill. I regret deeply I did not get more time for \nmy friend from Arizona to review the bill.\n  As the years have gone by, we have come to appreciate each other more \nin terms of the roles we play in this process. The Senator from Arizona \nis the watchdog of the Treasury as far as this process is concerned. I \nadmire and respect that as far as the Senator is concerned, and I look \nforward to comments he will make tonight.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I see the Senator from West Virginia. I appreciate the \nindulgence of the Senator from West Virginia. I will take just a \nminute.\n  I thank the Senator from Alaska for the hard work he and his staff \nhave done. I also hope Members understand that we did not receive this \nbill until sometime late morning and it is, as the Senator from Alaska \npointed out, the largest bill in the history of Congress. I see it \nsitting to his right. I think it is several thousand pages. I believe, \nin all candor, in order to review it, my staff would have to stay up \nall night.\n  I understand the urgency of voting tonight, but I hope the Senator \nwill indulge me and my staff another hour and a half for us to get \nthrough at least a majority of the bill, and then I would be asking for \nan hour, but I will not use a complete hour to comment on the bill. \nThat way, I hope it can accommodate Members so we could have a vote \nrelatively early this evening.\n  We are not finished by a long shot reviewing the bill. It is the \nlargest appropriation in the history of this country. At least in my \nmind, it deserves scrutiny and comment.\n  I thank the Senator from Alaska. I thank the Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, as the ranking member on the Committee on \nAppropriations, I thank my friend, the chairman of the Senate \nAppropriations Committee, Ted Stevens, and I also thank House \nAppropriations Committee Chairman Bill Young as well as the ranking \nmember of the House Appropriations Committee, Representative David \nObey, for their hard work in bringing H.J. Res. 2, a joint resolution \nmaking consolidated appropriations for fiscal year 2003, to the floor. \nI thank all of the conferees on both sides of the aisle and in both \nHouses for their hard work on this legislation.\n  I join with my chairman in paying our respects to and thanking our \nstaff people, on both sides of the aisle, who have worked long hours \nfor long weeks and for long months on this bill. We are now over 4 \nmonths into the fiscal year and the domestic agencies of our Government \nhave had to operate under eight continuing resolutions. Unfortunately, \nthe House of Representatives has not passed a regular appropriations \nbill since July--since July of last year. That is over 29 weeks without \nsending a regular appropriations bill to the Senate for consideration.\n  I have been in these premises for more than 50 years. I have never \nseen such a performance in this half century in which I served in this \nbody and the other body. I have never seen such a dismal performance.\n  When Democrats were in the majority in the Senate, we produced 13 \nresponsible bipartisan bills. I owed, always owed and sought to give \ndue credit to my distinguished colleague, the Senator from Alaska, \nbecause he was always so helpful, so cooperative, always so courteous \nin his treatment toward me and I have always recognized that and always \nsought to assign due credit, proper credit to him and to his colleagues \non that side of the aisle.\n  The President's budget for fiscal year 2003 was seriously deficient \nin a number of critical domestic programs such as homeland security, \neducation, veterans medical care, highway construction, and Amtrak. In \nthe bills that were approved in the Senate Appropriations Committee by \nunanimous votes last summer--the votes of every Republican and \nDemocrat, all 29, 15 Democrats at that time and 14 Republicans, all 29 \nvotes voted unanimously--we added about $11 billion or about 3 percent \nto the President's request to respond to these shortfalls.\n  Regrettably, the conference agreement that the House and Senate \nRepublican leadership bring before us this evening cuts back domestic \nspending by nearly $8 billion, with cuts in homeland security, land \nconservation programs, Head Start, State and local law enforcement, \nwater infrastructure grants, mass transit, the National Park Service, \nembassy security, and many other programs.\n  I am particularly troubled about the cuts in homeland security \nprograms, given the increased threat level under which we are all now \nliving. My colleagues, the security of this Nation is on thin ice. This \nadministration has held back support for critical investments in \nhomeland security, in police officers, in firefighters, in border, \nairport, and seaport security. As a result of this White House's \nintransigence, America is woefully unprepared to prevent or respond to \nanother terrorist attack.\n  In this conference report, spending for our Nation's first responders \nhas been cut by $1.6 billion from the levels approved by the Senate \nAppropriations Committee last summer. Funding has also been cut for \nborder security by $182 million, embassy security by $42 million, and \nfor hiring COPS on the beat by $130 million, enough to hire 1,360 \npolice officers and other personnel.\n\n  The American people should know that if there is a chemical or \nbiological attack in their neighborhood, the odds are that the police, \nthe firemen, the medical personnel who will respond may not have either \nthe equipment or the training necessary to help when that help is \nneeded most.\n  For example, the National Fire Protection Association and FEMA \nestimate that only 13 percent of the fire departments around the \ncountry have fire personnel with the specialized training and equipment \nto handle chemical or biological attacks.\n  Why is America so vulnerable? Because this White House is hoping to \nprotect the American people on a shoestring homeland security budget, \nheld together with duct tape.\n  Since September 11, 2001, the President, with great fanfare, has \nsigned legislation to authorize improvements in security at our \nairports, security at our ports, and on our borders. The President also \nannounced a plan for State and local governments to vaccinate 10 \nmillion first responders for a potential smallpox attack. But the \nPresident has not funded that effort, nor has he requested money for it \nin his budget.\n  Time after time after time, the administration has talked about \nhomeland security, but time after time after time the administration \nhas failed to invest in homeland security.\n  Add it up. Add it up. The President turned his back to $2.5 billion \nin emergency homeland security funds last August. This past fall the \nPresident forced $1.5 billion in cuts to homeland security initiatives \nin the appropriations bills that unanimously passed the Senate \nAppropriations Committee last July. Just last month the administration \nopposed two homeland security funding amendments which I offered on \nthis floor, one for $5 billion, another for $3 billion, and the \nadministration labeled these funds as ``extraneous.''\n  Those are billions of dollars in homeland security protections that \ncould be at work right now. Those are billions of dollars that could be \nin place today for new police and firefighter training, for expanded \nborder security, for vaccines against smallpox. Those are billions of \ndollars that could be helping to protect American lives today. But time \nafter time after time after time, this administration said no, calling \nthose homeland security funds ``extraneous'' and ``wasteful.''\n  Now, when the President signs the omnibus bill, the administration \nwill proclaim with great fanfare that it held a hard line on Federal \nspending. I hope that the White House hard line will not result in \nAmericans becoming hard targets for terrorists.\n  No longer can we nickel-and-dime our first responders. These firemen \nand police officers and emergency medical teams simply cannot do the \njob we expect them to do, and that the American people expect them to \ndo, without enough financial support from the Federal Government.\n\n[[Page S2431]]\n\n  We should not accept the alarming deficiencies in our seaport \nsecurity--an area that many experts have identified as perhaps the \nNation's single greatest vulnerability. We should not accept the fact \nthat first responders and local doctors and nurses do not have \nsufficient training and equipment to handle wide-ranging threats \ninvolving madmen who may have gotten their hands on weapons of mass \ndestruction. With these looming gaps, what is the administration's \ngreat homeland security plan?\n  What will protect the American people? Will it be duct tape, plastic \nsheeting, and a new federal bureaucracy? We did not create a new \nDepartment of Homeland Security just to be told to buy duct tape and \nplastic.\n  When it comes to fighting overseas, this Administration's attitude is \nto spare no expense. In fact, the Vice President interceded personally \nover the weekend to include billions of new dollars for Defense \nDepartment efforts in this omnibus bill. That is all well and good. But \nwhen it comes to fighting the war here at home, this administration \nrelies on duct tape and plastic.\n  We are in new and dangerous times. No threat can be ignored. The men \nand women who send us here demand that we protect them. The fathers and \nmothers who send their children to school each morning expect us to \ninvest their hard-earned dollars to keep their little ones safe. That \nis a solemn duty. It is a basic and sacred duty. When the people ask \nfor our best efforts to protect them from madmen, we must not respond \nwith duct tape.\n  Chairman Stevens and House Appropriations Committee Chairman Young \ndid all they could to produce an omnibus bill that meets the needs of \nthe American people within the low spending level imposed by the \nadministration.\n  I believe that the most damaging result of the 2003 appropriations \nprocess for the Nation and for our States would be for our domestic \nagencies to be forced to operate under a continuing resolution for the \nentire fiscal year. Such a full year continuing resolution would reduce \ndomestic spending by up to another $14 billion below the levels in the \nomnibus.\n  Chairman Stevens of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Chairman \nBill Young of the House Appropriations Committee, and Mr. Obey, my \ncounterpart on the House side, did everything they could to avoid \noperating their Government on a continuing resolution that would go to \nthe end of the fiscal year.\n  Therefore, I am going to support passage of this legislation. \nHowever, I must raise a concern about how this legislation was \nproduced. Over the past several weeks, the Appropriations Committee has \nworked to craft a conference report to include the eleven spending \nbills for fiscal year 2003 that were not concluded during the 107th \nCongress. The Appropriations Committee takes great pride in the \nbipartisan approach we have maintained over the years to produce bills \nto fund this nation's necessary programs. The bipartisan spirit of this \nCommittee enables us to carefully balance the needs of all Americans \nand to successfully craft bills that, with few exceptions, are signed \ninto law.\n  We all recognize the unusual circumstances surrounding passage of \nmost of the fiscal year 2003 appropriations bills. Still, I am pleased \nto report that the general rule of bipartisan cooperation among the \nmembers and staff of this Committee has continued to prevail and, \nthereby, we have before us now a conference report that strives to \nprovide fair treatment for all Senators, at least in terms of the \nregular 2003 appropriations provisions.\n  However, notwithstanding the bipartisanship exhibited at the \nsubcommittee level, there have been some serious problems encountered \nin the formulation of the conference agreement on the omnibus \nappropriations legislation.\n  Today's headline in The Washington Post reads, ``GOP Wraps Up \nSpending Package.'' There is some truth to that statement. Behind \nclosed doors, the Senate Majority Leader, the Speaker of the House of \nRepresentatives, and the Chairmen of the House and Senate \nAppropriations Committees met and settled on a number of the big \nissues. Vice President Cheney provided the administration's views.\n  At these partisan meetings, decisions were made on such issues as the \noverall top line total of the omnibus appropriations legislation, the \nsize of the across-the-board cut, the matter of environmental riders \nand the substance of the $3.1 billion drought package, along with the \noffsets from the previously enacted farm bill that were included at the \ninsistence of the White House. These farm bill offsets because \nnecessary when the White House refused to raise the top line by $3.1 \nbillion to accommodate the mandatory spending in the drought package.\n  More specifically, Division N of omnibus legislation includes a title \nto provide disaster assistance for farmers and ranchers due to drought \nand related conditions. This item was included in the bill passed by \nthe Senate in January. However, when this bill went to conference, this \nitem was not made part of the normal bipartisan conference process. In \nfact, no appropriations subcommittee was even involved in the \nconference negotiation on disaster assistance. Rather, it seems, the \nentire negotiation was conducted by the majority authorization \ncommittees, and no discussions with minority appropriations or \nauthorization committee staff ever occurred until the final product was \npresented to the Appropriations Committee just as the finishing touches \nto the overall omnibus appropriations legislation were being made.\n  In summary, with no Democrats in the room, the House and Senate \nRepublican leadership designed a program that assessed the $3.1 billion \noffset against a farm program which one of our colleagues had labored \nfor 5 years to get enacted. The House and Senate Republican leadership \nchose to cut domestic programs by nearly $8 billion from the bi-\npartisan bills approved by the Appropriations Committee last summer. \nThere also was no discussion of the decision to include an arbitrary \nacross-the-board cut on domestic programs.\n  The package was approved by the House and Senate Republican \nleadership and given to the Appropriations Committees to be laid into \nthe omnibus legislation. The conferees never met to approve the final \nconference report.\n  This is no way to develop legislation. When minority Senators are \nexcluded from discussions, it has the effect of disenfranchising the \nmillions of American citizens who are represented by those Senators \nlike myself.\n  There is not much we can do about this problem now. We are faced with \nthe alternative of operating on a continuing resolution for the rest of \nthe year--which I don't want to do, which Chairman Stevens, Chairman \nYoung, and Mr. Obey have labored valiantly to avoid--which would have \nthe effect of reducing domestic spending by up to another $14 billion \nbelow the levels in the omnibus legislation.\n\n  It is my hope that in the future there will be a resumption of full \nbipartisan cooperation for all items that are included in any \nappropriations bill. If members want to add items to an appropriations \nbill that are the product of an authorization committee, that committee \nmust adhere to the bipartisan standards of the Appropriations \nCommittee. If they choose not to do so, I strongly suggest that they \nfind a legislative vehicle other than an appropriations bill on which \nto attach their measure.\n  Again, I thank the truly distinguished chairman of the Senate \nAppropriations Committee, Mr. Stevens, for his cooperation, for his \nmany courtesies towards me and towards my colleagues on this side of \nthe aisle, and for his friendship and the friendship of all members of \nthe Appropriations Committee on both sides of the aisle.\n  I also thank the staff of the committee. I cannot find the words to \nadequately express my deep appreciation to the staff people on this \ncommittee. They work hard. They work long hours. They work long weeks. \nThey work weekends and are away from their families. And they labor \nunder very difficult conditions in order to help to bring to the \nchairman and the ranking member of the full committee a measure which \ncan then be brought to the floor and voted on. These staff people \nperformed admirably under tight deadlines, especially during the last 6 \nweeks.\n  I look forward to working with my colleague, Mr. Stevens, on the \nfiscal\n\n[[Page S2432]]\n\nyear 2004 appropriations process which will begin very soon.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, before he leaves the floor, I commend the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia for an excellent statement and \nassociate myself with his remarks. They were extremely well put.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished friend for his \ncomments. And I thank him always for his statecraft, for his handiwork \nin the development of legislation on the floor, and for his courage and \nability to stand up for what he believes.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia, who really is a role model for so many of us. I thank him.\n  Mr. President, I come to the floor today to discuss the provisions in \nthe omnibus spending bill, adopted unanimously by the Senate earlier, \nthat will protect the privacy and civil liberties of each and every \nlaw-abiding American citizen.\n  I am going to discuss this over the next few minutes. I see the \ndistinguished chairman of the full committee, Senator Stevens, in the \nChamber. Before I begin my remarks, I wish to express my appreciation \nto the chairman of the Appropriations Committee. He and his staff have \nbeen so gracious and so kind with respect to this issue.\n  The program I am going to discuss, the Total Information Awareness \nProgram, is the most far-reaching and most expansive program of \nsurveillance ever proposed. Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye, in \nparticular, with the help of Senator Byrd and Senator Feinstein, and \nSenator Grassley, colleagues on both sides of the aisle, worked very \nclosely with me.\n  But we simply would not have this amendment in the legislation, it \nwould not be bipartisan, if Senator Stevens had not been working with \nus. Because he is in the Chamber, I particularly thank my colleague for \nall his help.\n  Mr. President, and colleagues, the amendment I am going to discuss \ntonight would prohibit spending for technology research and development \nin the Total Information Awareness Program, or TIA, unless the \nDepartment of Defense reports to the Congress on its plans for the \ntechnology.\n  The provision also establishes proper congressional oversight of this \nsurveillance program by requiring explicit congressional approval for \ndeployment of any Total Information Awareness technology that would be \nused to spy on U.S. citizens on U.S. soil.\n  The Defense Department itself has had a virtual database--and I will \nquote--that was described as ``a new kind of extremely large, \nomnimedia, virtually centralized and semantically rich information \nrepository.'' In my mind, such a novel and broadly proposed program--a \nprogram that has fingers snaking into so many areas of Americans' \nlives--is a textbook case of a program that needs vigorous \ncongressional oversight.\n  In recent days, the Department of Defense and the Defense Advanced \nResearch Project Agency, or DARPA, have announced the formation of two \noversight boards for the TIA Program--one within the Total Information \nAwareness Program and another Federal advisory board. In my view, this \nis a positive development. It indicates that they understand the \ngrowing concern of the American people about the Total Information \nAwareness Program.\n  But I am very pleased that Chairman Stevens and the conferees shared \nmy view, and that is that the establishment of these panels in no way \nreduces the need for congressional oversight of the Total Information \nAwareness Program. The conferees understood that these oversight \nboards, while useful, are not an argument for abdicating the \nresponsibility of the Congress on this issue.\n\n  As I mentioned, this has been a bipartisan effort with Senators \nFeinstein and Reid--the distinguished Senator from Nevada is in the \nChamber, Mr. Reid--who have been very helpful. Suffice it to say, not \none Member of Congress--no one in the Senate, no one in the other body, \nDemocrat or Republican--has disagreed with the proposition of our \namendment, and that is that it is the responsibility--indeed, the \nduty--of this Congress to insist on oversight of the Total Information \nAwareness Program. Not one Senator said: Look, Congress does not need \nto put brakes on the most far-reaching Government surveillance effort \never proposed.\n  On the contrary, what Congress said was: We are going to insist that \nthis program is not going to be allowed to grow unchecked and \nunaccountable. In fact, it is the duty of the Congress to protect the \ncivil liberties and privacy of the people we represent. The call for \nstrong safeguards has come through loud and clear, and that call has \nbeen recognized in the conference.\n  One publication in my home State, the Newport News-Times, put it very \nwell. I will quote it. That publication said:\n\n       Just visiting the web site of what is affectionately billed \n     as [the Total Information Awareness Program] is a trip into a \n     future we hope not to meet. If our government still believes \n     in the sanctity of the constitution this week, let's hope for \n     the President's signature.\n\n  All across the Nation, Americans have said that while a vigorous \nresponse to terror is necessary, a system designed to spy on Americans \nin America is not. It is not only unnecessary, it is contrary to the \nfreedoms that the war on terror aims to protect.\n  The total information awareness concept requires keeping track of \nindividuals and understanding how they fit into models. For instance, \ndoes a seemingly innocent individual conduct himself or herself \naccording to a pattern that terrorists have exhibited in the past?\n  To find out whether any current U.S. citizens fit the model of a \nterrorist living among us, the Total Information Awareness Program \nwould develop a way to integrate the databases that already track our \ndaily lives--bank records, online purchases, and travel plans, for \ninstance. Once integrated, these disparate databases would serve as one \ngiant repository of information on most or all of the computer-linked \ntransactions an individual makes. Then you run the models, then you \nmake a judgment of who looks like a terrorist. TIA's technology would \ngive any Federal agency the capability to develop risk profiles for \nmillions of Americans as they look for questionable conduct.\n  When I first heard about this program--I am sure there are many \nothers who came to think this as well--when you hear this initially, \nyou say, this sounds like a good idea. If you snoop on everybody all \nthe time, you are more likely to spot a few criminal someones at the \nmoment they are up to no good. But the fact is, the police can't just \nstop someone on the street and frisk them for no reason. Current \nprivacy law is supposed to prohibit private companies and the \nGovernment from rummaging through your online records.\n  Unfortunately--and this is what you learn when you look at the total \ninformation proposal in depth--as it stands, the Total Information \nAwareness Program would use technology to pick regular Americans up by \nthe ankles and shake them to see if anything funny falls out.\n  Now, I understand that terrorists are not going to hang a shingle \noutside their hideaways announcing they have set up shop. They are not \ntechnological simpletons. And I know, as a member of the Intelligence \nCommittee, that extraordinary times such as this call for extraordinary \nmeasures to track down these terrorists. I do not take a back seat to \nanyone with respect to tracking down terrorists.\n  I believe one of the most important things I have been able to do as \na Member of this body is to write the Terrorist Identification \nClassification System, a bipartisan effort, that became law in the last \nsession, that allows us, on an ongoing basis, to watchdog terrorists, \nthe Mohammed Attas of the world. But there is a clear line between \nsomething that allows for tracking individuals where there is a known \ntrack record of terrorist activity--suspicious activity linked to \nterrorism--and, in effect, standing by while the Government shines an \nindiscriminate spotlight into the private lives and dealings of law-\nabiding Americans in this country on their own soil.\n  It is a question of striking a balance. The Terrorist Identification \nClassification System is an appropriate approach\n\n[[Page S2433]]\n\nfor the Government to take in seeking to weed out terrorism.\n  The Total Information Awareness Program is over the line. It is \ninvading the civil liberties of law-abiding Americans on U.S. soil. \nThat is why the conferees have wisely chosen to impose checks on it. \nThe intention of the Total Information Awareness Program and those who \nsupport it is undoubtedly to protect the America that we love. But the \nreality is that the program as proposed encroaches on the freedoms that \nmake us love America in the first place.\n  Millions of Americans understand that. They have made it clear that \nthey don't want this program to move forward unchecked and \nunaccountable, and that is why there has been such an outcry about it.\n  A few weeks ago I stood with a coalition in a room not far from this \nsacred Chamber that does not flock together all that often: Americans \nfor Tax Reform, the Eagle Forum two groups that are certainly \nconservative by anybody's calculus stood with the American Civil \nLiberties Union and a variety of groups that would be considered \nliberal, as they supported efforts to put vigorous oversight in place \nover this program. Suffice it to say, in my time in the Congress, I \nhave never seen a program that has generated more ideological concern \nacross the political spectrum. We have seen Democrats, Republicans, \nliberals, and conservatives all saying this is a program that warrants \nvigorous oversight and scrutiny by elected officials.\n  Just because the administration has promised in recent days to \ninstitute oversight panels and to not use their awesome power for \nnefarious purposes, does not mean that future leaders would not abuse \nthis program. So what we have said is that we are not going to let this \nprogram move forward without first ensuring permanent safeguards and \nprotections that without them would threaten Americans not just today \nbut many years in the future.\n  Some who advocate this program will say that the concerns of Members \nof Congress and others are overblown. Some say the program will not do \nwhat I described and it doesn't threaten the privacy of American \ncitizens in the way that first appears. I hope that is the case. If \nthat is the case, if in fact the Total Information Awareness Program \ndoes not threaten the civil liberties and privacy rights of the \nAmerican people, then the folks over at the Defense Department need to \ncome to the Congress and make that clear.\n  They need to do what they have not done to date, and that is to \nexplain more about what this program will do and how it will do it.\n  The fact is, this body is in the dark about the Total Information \nAwareness Program, the most expansive and far-reaching surveillance \nprogram ever proposed. Congress has not been informed as to what \nsafeguards and constitutional protections would be in place when this \nprogram goes forward. Therefore, my view is this Congress has no choice \nbut to pursue answers and explanations before allowing the program to \nproceed. That is what our amendment to the omnibus spending bill does, \nand that is what the conferees have wisely chosen to do.\n  My view is that these are reasonable provisions. The amendment calls \non the Department of Defense to explain in a report to be delivered to \nthe Congress within 90 days what technology they intend to develop and \nwhat they intend to do with it. Then the amendment further states that \nwhen any technology is developed for this program, it may not be \ndeveloped without the express approval of the Congress. If the Total \nInformation Awareness Program is something that is less invasive or \nsmaller in scope or different than I have described, then the \nadministration will have an opportunity to tell us.\n  This amendment does not prevent those who support the program as \ninitially outlined to have the chance to come back and show why \nadditional threats warrant additional action. What this amendment does \nis ensure that if this program moves forward, it does so in a fashion \nthat is sensitive to American freedoms, sensitive to constitutional \nprotections and safeguards, while still ensuring that our country can \nfight terrorism.\n  Finally, it all comes down to how we come forward and address a \nspecial task. What we must do now is to be vigilant, to make sure we \nare doing what is necessary to fight terrorism, but not approve actions \nor condone actions that could compromise the bedrock of this Nation--\nour Constitution.\n  I thank my colleagues, particularly Senators Stevens, Inouye, \nFeinstein, Grassley, Reid, and others, who said repeatedly that \nCongress should not shirk its obligation. The conferees who were \nappointed to reconcile this spending bill had a unique opportunity to \ndefend the Constitution and the United States. That is what we are \nelected to do. That is what we get election certificates for. They \nanswered that call. For that, I offer the thanks of Oregonians and all \nAmericans for whom civil liberties remain so special and precious \ntonight.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                 Telecommunications Training Institute\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I want to speak about the United States \nTelecommunications Training Institute (USTTI).\n  The statement of the managers accompanying the fiscal year 2003 \nOmnibus Appropriations Act, H.J. Res. 2, recommends $500,000 for USTTI \ncompared to $1,000,000 that was included in the Senate bill. However, \nthis funding level is the result of a misunderstanding between my \noffice, Senator McConnell's office, and Senator Inouye's office. The \nForeign Operations Subcommittee was under the impression that Senator \nInouye wanted $500,000 for USTTI, as had been the case in prior years. \nHowever, Senator Inouye is sure that he had informed the Subcommittee \nthat he wanted $1,000,000 for this organization. Does the senior \nSenator from Hawaii agree with my recollection?\n  Mr. INOUYE. I do. I would add that I have strongly supported USTTI \nfor a number of years, and have worked successfully with this \nsubcommittee to get funding for it. I would ask the Senator from \nVermont if the amount that is provided for USTTI in H.J. Res. 2 is a \nceiling, or is it his understanding that USAID may provide additional \nfunding for this organization if it is justified?\n  Mr. LEAHY. USAID could provide additional funding to USTTI, if it is \njustified. Moreover, members of the House and Senate subcommittee give \ngreat weight to the views of the senior Senator from Hawaii, and I have \nlittle doubt that additional accommodation could have been made at the \nconference if this misunderstanding had not occurred.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I am informed that USTTI is in need of additional funds \nto accommodate a range of important training programs that it \nimplements. Would Chairman McConnell and Senator Leahy support the \nprovision of additional funds to USTTI?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I would support additional funding, and would encourage \nUSTTI to discuss their specific needs with USAID. I have a short note \nfrom Chairman McConnell,  also indicating his support for this project, \nand I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 13, 2003.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     U.S. Senator,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Pat: Please know that I support additional funding to \n     the United States Telecommunications Training Institute \n     (USTTI)--at the Senate reported level of $1,000,000.\n       I would appreciate your conveying my support for this \n     funding level to our friend and colleague from Hawaii.\n       Thank you for your kind consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Mitch McConnell,\n                                            United States Senator.\n\n\n                        Technical Clarification\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI: Madam President, I would like to bring to his attention \nan inaccuracy in the manager's statement, and ask for a technical \nclarification. As the Senator is aware, the manager's statement \nincludes language on a project within the Department of Commerce/\nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration/National Marine \nFisheries Service/Habitat Conservation Research and Management Services \naccount: ``Chesapeake Bay Oyster Research'' for $2 million.\n  Will the chair recognize that $2 million included in the Department \nof\n\n[[Page S2434]]\n\nCommerce/National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/\nNational Marine Fisheries Service/Habitat Conservation Research and \nManagement Services account for ``Chesapeake Bay Oyster Research'' is \nactually for ``oyster restoration'' activities in the Chesapeake Bay?\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator from Maryland is correct. The committee \nincluded these funds in the National Marine Fisheries Service account \nto, in part, further oyster restoration and replenishment efforts in \nthe Chesapeake Bay. It is the committee's expectation that NOAA will \nuse the sums indicated for oyster restoration efforts in the Chesapeake \nBay.\n\n\n                         Intent of Section 211\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I want to take a moment to clarify an \nissue that may lead to some confusion with respect to the intent of \nsection 211 of the Commerce, Justice, State title of this bill. The \nStatement of Managers incorrectly states that two foreign cruise ships \nwill be allowed to reflag under U.S. registry for operations in the \nU.S. coastwise trade. This was a drafting error and should have stated, \nto reflect the bill language, that three ships will be allowed to \nreflag to U.S. registry. I simply want to confirm with my friend from \nAlaska that the bill language is controlling.\n  Mr. STEVENS. My friend from Hawaii is correct. The bill language is \nthe law and controls the operation of the provision. I regret that the \nStatement of Managers was incorrectly drafted. It should have reflected \nthat three cruise ships will be allowed to reflag under U.S. registry.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I thank my friend for that clarification and for all of \nhis hard work on this bill.\n  Mr. HARKIN. One of the key provisions of the bipartisan Farm Security \nand Rural Investment Act of 2002 signed into law by President Bush last \nyear was a significant new conservation initiative called the \nConservation Security Program (CSP) which will, if properly \nimplemented, significantly improve conservation practices and result in \ncleaner air and water.\n  I want to clarify the intent of provisions related to this program \nincluded in this conference report and actions that will be taken to \npreserve current law provisions. First, it is my understanding that it \nwas the intention of the conferees that the CSP be implemented and \noperated according to the terms of the 2002 farm bill. Second, it is my \nunderstanding that the provisions in this conference report were only \nintended to apply to years following expiration of this measure and \nwere not intended in any way to modify operation of the program prior \nto the beginning of fiscal year 2008. Third, it is my understanding \nthat as soon as possible this year a conference report that is expected \nto become law will be brought before the Senate that contains \nprovisions that assure that the CSP will operate as established and \nintended in the 2002 farm bill for the duration of that bill.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I understand the Senator from Iowa's concerns. I intend \nthat the provisions of the conference report relative to this program \nwould not have any effect on the operation of the program during the \nlife of this farm bill. I would be pleased to work with him to insure \nthat the program funding is restored.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I also concur with the statements of the chair and \nranking member of the Agriculture Committee about the intent of \nprovisions included in this conference report related to the CSP. It \nwas not our intention, in any way, to modify the operation of this \nprogram prior to the beginning of fiscal year 2008. I join Senator \nCochran in my determination to resolve this matter in an appropriate \nconference report this year. He has my commitment to work with my \ncolleagues to assure that the Senate acts at the earliest possible date \nthis year on a conference report that is expected to become law that \nwill assure that the CSP operates as established and intended in the \n2002 farm bill for the duration of that bill.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Conservation Security Program was an important part \nof the 2002 farm bill. It holds tremendous potential to help our \nfarmers and ranchers clean up the environment. I, too, concur that the \nSenator from Iowa's statements about the intent of this conference \nreport. I truly appreciate the bipartisan commitments of my colleagues \nto ensure that the CSP is implemented and operated as we intended.\n  Mr. FRIST. I look forward to working with my colleagues in this \nregard.\n\n\n                   funding for the oglala sioux tribe\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, it is my understanding that the omnibus \nappropriations bill includes $300,000 for the Oglala Sioux Tribe to \nautomate the functions of the tribe's court system. I would like to \nenter into a colloquy with my colleague from South Carolina regarding \nthis funding, which is included in the Omnibus Appropriations bill.\n  It is my understanding that the funding in question is intended to be \nused by Cangleska, Inc., a non-profit organization located on the Pine \nRidge Indian Reservation in South Dakota that is dedicated to the \nprevention of domestic violence and sexual assault, to help enhance the \ncapacity of the Oglala Sioux Tribe to arrest, prosecute, and \nrehabilitate offenders.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Yes, that is correct.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the Senior Senator from South Carolina for his \nclarification regarding this matter.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, I rise today to express my deep \ndisappointment with the so-called drought aid provisions included by \nthe White House and Republican leadership in the fiscal year 2003 \nomnibus appropriations bill.\n  Coincidentally, 1 year ago the Senate first adopted drought aid--as \npart of the Senate farm bill--to cover losses experienced by farmers \nand ranchers in 2001. At that time, 68 Senators joined me and voted in \nbipartisan cooperation to support the victims of drought. However, one \nyear ago was also the first time the administration voiced in the \nstrongest possible terms their opposition to emergency aid for farmers \nand ranchers. The White House declared that assistance to farmers and \nranchers had to be cannibalized from the farm bill--a position never \nbefore taken by any administration with respect to a natural disaster. \nAs Mother Nature turned the hands of time in 2002, the drought \nconditions became even more persistent. By autumn, more than half the \ncounties in the U.S. were affected by drought conditions and ``ground \nzero'' unfortunately was the Northern Plains of South Dakota and our \nneighboring states. In fact, the drought dealt so much damage to the \nSouth Dakota economy that South Dakota State University estimated the \ntotal economic loss to reach nearly $2 billion. Senator Daschle and I \nled an effort in the Senate to enact emergency legislation providing at \nleast $6 billion for farmers and livestock producers who experienced \ncrop and forage losses in 2001 and 2002. Our drought relief plan was \nconsistent with the approach Congress would always take with respect to \nthe aftermath of a natural disaster--our relief was emergency in nature \nbecause droughts, floods, fires, and hurricanes are historically \naddressed by emergency assistance. Despite the clear need for emergency \naid, the White House hard-line prevailed last year and multiple efforts \nto enact drought relief were defeated by White House foot soldiers in \nCongress.\n  I firmly believe that in order to help agricultural producers coping \nwith the drought, the relief must be comprehensive. But the plan \nadvanced in the omnibus today shortchanges producers in a number of \nways. First, the relief plan written by Vice President Cheney and House \nand Senate Republicans provides inadequate aid for losses occurring in \neither 2001 or 2002, but not both. Second, the $3.1 billion offered in \nthe omnibus does not adequately cover the severe crop and forage losses \nproducers suffered as a result of the drought. Third, cutting the new \nConservation Security Program (CSP) in the farm bill to pay for the \ndisaster aid is a terrible precedent to set. When a hurricane damages \nthe Gulf Coast or an earthquake occurs in California, the Federal \nEmergency Management Agency (FEMA) budget is not raided, rather \nemergency aid is provided to natural disaster victims. A drought is no \ndifferent, and it's a crippling mistake to cut the farm bill in order \nto pay for a drought emergency. Fourth, the special-interest provisions \nslipped into the omnibus drought plan by Republican authors leaves much \nto be desired. While the proposal that Senator Daschle and I advanced \nwould cover\n\n[[Page S2435]]\n\nall crop losses, the omnibus makes special grants to cotton and tobacco \nfarmers. Moreover, the omnibus contains a special section to address \nhurricane losses and $10 million to the State of Texas. This simply is \nnot fair.\n  How did White House and Republican negotiators find the farm bill \nfunds to pay for this woefully inadequate disaster aid? I am told they \nasked the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) to revise the estimated \ncost of the CSP. CBO's re-estimate reportedly grew the cost of the new \nconservation program to around $6.8 billion over ten years. This level \nis substantially above CBO's initial estimate of the cost of the CSP--\n$2 billion over 10 years. I am very disappointed that Republicans \nemployed a budget gimmick to inflate the cost of the CSP in order to \nlaunder funds through the program and pay for disaster aid. This entire \nprocess is a dis-service to farmers, ranchers, and conservationists and \nis sure to create hard feelings among these groups. According to the \nCongressional Research Service (CRS), not in three decades has a \nprogram in the farm bill been cut in order to pay for a natural \ndisaster. This historically outrageous move to eliminate money from a \nconservation program in the farm bill to address a drought emergency \nmay prove a precedent that hurts farmers, ranchers, and the environment \nfor years to come. It is terribly short-sighted and I cannot support \nsuch a step.\n  Less than 6 months ago, 77 Senators joined Senator Daschle and I in \nsupport of $6 billion in drought aid for farmers and ranchers suffering \nlosses in 2001 and 2002. Today, it appears producers will get less than \nhalf of what they need and pay the price in the long run with a cut to \nthe farm bill. I am disappointed that nearly thirty of my colleagues in \nthe Senate dropped their support for comprehensive and emergency \ndrought aid totaling $6 billion in order to satisfy the White House for \nhalf that much.\n  My record on drought relief for farmers and ranchers is clear. On \nthree occasions in the last Congress, the Senate passed relief that \nwould have compensated all drought victims for their loss. \nUnfortunately, each time objections from the White House and the House \nRepublican leadership stopped this aid from making it to producers. \nSouth Dakota's farmers and ranchers deserve better and for this reason \nI will not support the so-called drought aid in the omnibus.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, the Senate is now considering and will \nsoon adopt the omnibus conference report on H.J. Res. 2. I will vote \nfor the conference report. I know from my work on the Appropriations \nCommittee that this bill represents a genuine effort by many in both \nbodies to finally finish the fiscal year 2003 appropriations bill.\n  I want to begin my remarks by thanking our leader on this side, \nSenator Robert Byrd. Senator Byrd was the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee when the fiscal year 2003 appropriations \nprocess began. He steered all 13 appropriations bills through the \ncommittee with bipartisan support from every member of the committee. \nSenator Byrd was instrumental in putting this conference report \ntogether. I know the Senator has many concerns about this bill. I share \nmany of his concerns and particularly those regarding the many cuts to \nhomeland security in this bill. The Senator has been a leading voice \nfor homeland security funding and I look forward to working closely \nwith him in the days ahead as this body works on this important issue.\n  I also want to acknowledge and thank the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee. We are here tonight because of the determined \nleadership of Senator Ted Stevens. I know many of my colleagues did not \nwant to see the Congress agree to fund the government with a continuing \nresolution for the rest of the fiscal year. This would have represented \na huge failure on the part of the Congress, setting a dangerous \nprecedent for the legislative branch's working relationship with the \nExecutive Branch. Chairman Stevens is a tough but fair chairman. I \nappreciate the work he has put in to manage and successfully complete \nthis very unusual process.\n  I appreciate the inclusion of funding for many projects and programs \nthat directly benefit the environment and natural resources in my \nbeautiful home State. The bill includes funding for salmon recovery \nwork from the Elwha River in northwest Washington to the Snake River in \nsoutheast Washington and nearly every community between. Funding is \nalso provided to fight the Spartina infestation in Willapa Bay and to \nacquire important ecological lands around the State. However, while I \nam very grateful for my colleagues willingness to support my work to \nsecure this funding, I must express my dismay over anti-environmental \nprovisions included in the bill and its failure to adequately fund the \nconservation trust fund created 3 years ago.\n  The conference considered many different provisions related to the \nTongass National Forest which sought to strip away environmental \nconsiderations in the management of the forest. I appreciate the \nconference removing these provisions, but wish the one remaining \nprovision could have also been deleted.\n  Also of concern to me is a provision retained in the omnibus that \nsignificantly expands the Forest Service's stewardship contracting \nprogram. This had been a pilot project intended to see if the \nstewardship contracts were a constructive tool in addressing forest \nhealth issues. The problem with the provision in the bill is that it \ncreates a permanent program before we have received any data from the \npilot projects already authorized. There is simply no data yet in upon \nwhich to make the decision to provide unlimited expansion of the \nprogram. I want to make clear that I support the pilot program and \nbelieve stewardship contracting could be a valuable tool in addressing \nforest health issues, but in order for this to be a valuable tool, it \nmust be one that has the trust of Congress and citizens. There is \nsimply not enough data to have created that trust yet.\n  There are many great accomplishments in this bill. I am particularly \nproud of the work we did in the transportation title. The Senate worked \nvery hard to keep my amendment to fund the Community Action Program or \nCAP at $120 million for the fiscal year. I appreciate the Senate's hard \nwork to stand for this small program that is making a difference all \nacross the country. This bill provides increased funding for a number \nof education programs. Importantly, education programs like Head Start \nare exempted from any across the board cuts associated with this bill.\n  As we conclude the fiscal year 2003 appropriations process, I hope we \ncan move forward on the coming fiscal year with a renewed commitment to \nfinish all 13 appropriations bills on time. We will need the help of \nour House colleagues and of course, the administration is an important \ncontributor to the appropriations process too. We must avoid a repeat \nperformance of fiscal year 2003.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I rise today to thank the \nconferees for helping the City of Boca Raton, FL, and the County of \nPalm Beach, FL, begin to deal with the bio-terrorist attack on the \nAmerican Media Building in October of 2001, and the death of Robert \nStevens, who worked in the building, due to anthrax.\n  That building remains closed off with 24-hour security, still \ninfested with anthrax, within a short distance of homes, schools, and \nother office buildings. But, now the U.S. Congress has authorized the \nGeneral Service Administration to receive title to the building within \n12 months of enactment of the omnibus bill.\n  The residents of Boca Raton and the surrounding communities will be \nrelieved to know that, with this language in the omnibus bill help is \non the way. I am confident that the General Service Administration, the \nFlorida Congressional Delegation and the owners of the American Media \nBuilding will be able to carry out the language in the omnibus bill and \ntransfer the building to GSA or another appropriate agency to rid south \nFlorida of this public health hazard.\n  The omnibus language provides for a report by GSA to Congress within \n270 days of enactment of the bill describing the expected agreement \nbetween GSA and the owners of the American Media Building regarding the \ntransfer of the property to the Federal Government.\n  The language further requests that a public health risk be shown. The \nlocal\n\n[[Page S2436]]\n\npublic health officials and the Governor of Florida both have \nacknowledged that the AMI Building poses a public health threat. And \nsince it is the first attack of its kind in the United States, the \namount of danger posed is still unknown.\n  Another provision talks about the liability of the owner of the \nproperty. It is logical that the owner of the building would remain \nliable until title is transferred to the Federal Government.\n  All of these provisions can be easily worked out to reach an \nagreement on the transfer of this building to the Federal Government.\n  And, as this process moves forward, I know that each party will carry \nout their responsibilities under this language with the utmost \nintegrity and with the concerns of the residents of Palm Beach County \nin mind. I look forward to monitoring the parties' progress toward an \nagreement.\n  In fact, I encourage the parties to meet on a regular basis with \nmembers of the Florida delegation so that this issue is resolved in the \nmost efficient manner.\n  As we all live with the increased threat of a chemical or biological \nattack, we need to keep in mind that a biological attack is not a mere \nthreat to south Florida and it is not something that occurred in the \npast and was taken care of--the anthrax attack remains.\n  Let us employ the powers of the Federal Government as the Founding \nfathers intended.\n  In Federalist Paper No. 23, Alexander Hamilton outlined the four \nprincipal reasons why the Federal Government was formed.\n  And the very first reason was for the common defense--national \nsecurity. An attack from an unknown source was perpetrated on this \ncommunity and the Federal Government has the power and the expertise to \nprotect and safeguard these citizens.\n  I look forward to the day when I can walk on the Senate floor and \ndeclare that this community is finally free of anthrax.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I want to alert you and my fellow \nSenators to a particularly egregious rider that was included in the \nomnibus appropriations conference report. After the conference \ncommittee met and behind closed doors, this special interest rider will \ngut the organic standards just recently enacted by U.S. Department of \nAgriculture.\n  I understand this special interest provision was inserted into the \nbill on behalf of a single producer who essentially wants to hijack the \n``organic'' certification label for his own purposes. He wants to get a \nmarket premium for his products, without actually being an organic \nproduct.\n  This provision will allow producers to label their meat and dairy \nproducts ``organic'' even though they do not meet the strict criteria \nset forth by USDA, including the requirement that the animals be fed \norganically grown feed. This approach was considered and outright \nrejected by USDA last June. The entire organic industry opposed this \nweakening of the organic standards. If beef, poultry, pork and dairy \nproducers are able to label their products as ``organic'' without using \norganic feed, which is one of the primary inputs, then what exactly is \norganic about the product?\n  This provision is particularly galling because so many producers have \nalready made the commitment to organic production. For most, this is a \nhuge financial commitment on their part. I have already heard from some \nlarge producers General Mills, Tyson Foods--around the country who are \nenraged by this special loophole included for one company that does not \nwant to play by the rules.\n  I am also very disappointed that just because one company could not \ncreate this loophole to the organic rule in public during the USDA \nprocess, the Republican leadership decided to bury it within the 2-foot \ntall spending bill. It was done behind closed doors after the \nconference committee met in public.\n  I will be introducing legislation today to strike this rider from the \nOmnibus Appropriations Act and I hope to move it through Congress \nquickly before it does gut the organic meat and dairy industry. We need \nto send a message to all producers that if you want to benefit from the \norganic standards economically, you must actually meet them. When I \nincluded the ``The Organic Foods Production Act'' in the 1990 farm \nbill, it was because farmers recognized the growing consumer demand for \norganically produced products, but needed a tool to help consumers know \nwhich products were truly organic and which were not. The act directed \nUSDA to set minimum national standards for products labeled ``organic'' \nso that consumers could make informed buying decisions. The national \nstandard also reassured farmers selling organically produced products \nthat they would not have to follow separate rules in each state, and \nthat their products could be labeled ``organic'' overseas.\n  The new standards have been enthusiastically welcomed by consumers, \nbecause through organic labeling they now can know what they are \nchoosing and paying for when they shop. This proposal to weaken the \norganic standards would undermine public confidence in organic \nlabeling, which is less than a year old.\n  Getting the organic standards that are behind the ``USDA Organic'' \nlabel right was a long and difficult process, but critically important \nto the future of the industry. Along the way, some tried to allow \nproducts treated with sewer sludge, irradiation, and antibiotics to be \nlabeled ``organic.'' The public outcry against this was overwhelming. \nMore than 325,000 people weighed in during the comment period, as did \nI. The groundswell of support for strong standards clearly showed that \nthe public wants ``organic'' to really mean something. Those efforts to \nhijack the term were defeated and this one should be too.\n  Consumers and producers rely on the standard. I hope members will \ncosponsor my bill and send a message to special interests that they \ncannot hijack the organic industry through a rider on the spending \nbill. This provision is an insult to organic producers and to consumers \naround the country.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, I would like to express my concerns \nabout a provision that has been buried in the fiscal year 2003 spending \npackage. The language would make contract air traffic control (ATC) \ntower construction costs eligible for Airport Improvement Program (AIP) \nfunding.\n  On the face of it, this provision looks acceptable. The concept of \nmaking contract ATC towers eligible for Federal assistance under AIP \nhas wide support in Congress. Many small and rural airports lack an ATC \ntower and do not share the safety benefits of having an air traffic \ncontroller to assist aircraft on takeoff and landing. Pilots at these \nairports are on their own, responsible for seeing and avoiding traffic. \nA number of smaller airports would like to use AIP funding to build a \ntower but are barred under current law. If these airports can make \ncritical safety upgrades with this funding, they should have that \noption.\n  The problem with the provision included in the fiscal year 2003 \nomnibus bill is that while it would properly allow small airports to \nuse AIP money to build new or replacement FAA contract towers, it would \nalso allow airports that built contract ATC towers after October 1, \n1996, to be eligible for reimbursement of their construction costs. The \nFederal Government already pays to operate these towers, and as a \ncondition of this assistance, these airports agreed that the government \nwould not pay the cost of constructing them.\n  This reimbursement would affect at least 21 contract towers that were \npreviously built and provide up to $25 million in total for these \nairports from current AIP funding. In this era of having our Federal \nresources limited by reduced revenues and the expense of ensuring the \nsecurity of our homeland, it is irresponsible for this Congress to \nprovide funds from the AIP program to reimburse these airports for \ncosts that have already been accounted for.\n  The AIP program is vital to the safety, security and capacity needs \nof our Nation's airways. I am hopeful that we will carefully consider \nthe potential ramifications of this issue as we proceed later this year \nwith the reauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I want to recognize the hard work of my \nSenate colleagues, especially Senator Stevens, for putting together a \nconference report for our consideration tonight.\n\n[[Page S2437]]\n\n  Last year the Senate Appropriations Committee under the leadership of \nmy distinguished colleague from West Virginia, Senator Byrd, reported \nall 13 appropriations bills. Those bills formed the basis of the \nomnibus bill we are considering tonight. Unfortunately, this bill makes \nunwise reductions in many of the most important areas of our Federal \nGovernment, including education and homeland security. This bill also \nincludes a provision that would make reckless changes to our Nation's \nforest management policy. This rider--which would provide the long-term \nauthorization to contract the management and unfettered harvesting of \nnational forests to timber companies--was so controversial when it was \nproposed in the farm bill that Democrats removed the entire forestry \ntitle rather than take it.\n  Rather than write individual timber contracts, the Forest Service has \nengaged in pilots of this stewardship idea for the last few years. It \nis a process by which the normal limits on contracting are avoided and \ntimber companies are given broad leeway to harvest;\n  Some 84 stewardship contract pilots have so far been approved; none \nare complete; none have been evaluated to see if they meet the claim \nthat the timber industry ``stewards'' are managing the pilots well;\n  Despite the fact that pilots haven't been evaluated, this rider \ncontains a broad authorization for stewardship contracting;\n  It allows the Forest Service to pay contractors with trees rather \nthan appropriated money, hence increasing incentive for harvest of \nlarge trees and making the Forest Service more directly dependent on \ntimber sales.\n  Currently the Forest Service supervises sales, marking trees for cut; \nunder this proposal, oversight is gone. It would be up to the timber \ncompany to decide what to cut. The rider enables the Forest Service to \nallow timber companies to take over large swaths of public forests by \naffording giving them long term management authority as part of these \ncontracts. This is an important issue that deserves the full debate and \nconsideration of the Senate. I am disappointed that it was included in \nthis must-pass spending measure.\n\n  I also want to discuss in detail some of the funding priorities in \nthis bill. This funding bill provides $4.5 billion less in funding for \nhomeland security and emergency responders than the appropriations \nbills passed by the Senate last year. Just last year, we passed a bill \nto create a new Department of Homeland Security. Republicans and \nDemocrats came together to approve the largest reorganization of the \nFederal Government in decades. Without sufficient funding that new \nagency won't translate into improved safety on the ground, in our \nneighborhoods, cities and rural areas. This is an issue that is \nparticularly important for my State of Nevada. We have one of the most \nimportant facilities and some of the most talented personnel for \ntraining emergency responders.\n  Just today, one of the managers of this program spoke to me about how \nmany trainers they would be able to train this year with the \n$35,000,000 approved by the Senate. He told me that he could train \n8,000 emergency responders this year. This facility at the Nevada Test \nSite is one of five counter-terrorism training facilities that formed a \nconsortium several years ago. Together these five facilities could \ntrain nearly 35,000 first responders with the amount of money the \nSenate provided. Every $4,000 less we spend is one less first responder \nwe train. These are the police and firefighters in communities \nthroughout the country. These are the emergency responders who are \nalready overworked by the increased threat level we are experiencing. \nThese are the first responders who still are not sure how to change \ntheir patrols and activities in response to the elevated orange threat \nlevel. They need to know. They need to be trained.\n  Instead of the $35 million approved by the Senate, the final \nconference report agreed to provide $20 million for the training. While \nthis is a large amount of funding, it will only meet a small portion of \nthe need for training. I hope as the year continues that the \nadministration will request additional funds to ensure that at least \none member of every police, fire and emergency response unit in the \ncountry receives homeland security training.\n  I also want to comment on the funding this bill provides for \neducation. Every person who wants to get an education in Nevada, and \nthroughout the country, deserves to have the opportunity to get one. \nWhether we are talking about the 230,000 students in the Clark County \nPublic Schools or the 11,000 students who attend Truckee Meadows \nCommunity College, every person who wants an education in Nevada, and \nthroughout the country, deserves one.\n  During the last Congress, we worked together in a bipartisan fashion \nto pass a sweeping education reform bill. This bill showed the best of \nwhat the Congress can do when Republicans and Democrats work together. \nThis omnibus bill does not live up to the promise of that crucial bill. \nInstead of ensuring that we leave no child behind, this bill leaves \nmuch to fund.\n  In summary, I again want to thank my colleagues for their tireless \neffort to complete this conference report for our consideration this \nevening. This bill does not do enough to ensure every American can live \nup to his or her potential. We have an obligation to provide our states \nwith a clean, safe environment, a secure homeland, and the ability to \neducate every person. This bill could do more to accomplish these \ngoals, and next year, I hope we will do that.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, America is on high alert. This is no \ntime to shortchange our security at home. Yet, that is precisely what \nthis bill does.\n  Simply creating a new bureaucracy for homeland security is not \nenough. We must increase protection at our borders, provide the Coast \nGuard with additional resources, and provide more security at our \nports. We must also assist local authorities to prepare for the worst. \nOur homes will not stay safe with duct tape alone. Our communities need \nhelp to fund law enforcement personnel, firefighters, rescue workers, \nand medical personnel.\n  Today, I asked mayors in Massachusetts whether the Federal Government \nis doing its share to help local communities with homeland security. \nNot one--not one--has received sufficient help from the Bush \nadministration to meet local homeland security needs. Mayor Fred Kalisz \nof New Bedford tells me that since the Bush administration declared a \nCode Orange emergency last week, he has posted a 24-hour police \npresence at his small local airport. And he ordered round-the-clock \nsecurity for a tanker that is docked in New Bedford's harbor. The \nbudget crisis in Springfield, MA, forced Mayor Michael Albano to cut 76 \npolice officers and 57 firefighters from the city payroll. Police, \nfire, and rescue officers in Springfield are stretched to the limit to \ncover continuing duties with fewer officers. Springfield simply cannot \nafford the additional duties of homeland security without federal help. \nThe same is true in Worcester, where Mayor Timothy Murray is facing \ncuts to his police and firefighting force by more than ten percent. And \nhis officers not only fight crime in Worcester, but they have \nprotection duties with a strategic reservoir near Worcester as well as \nmajor rail hub. And the city of Boston has already spent $2.6 million \nin scarce city funds for homeland security.\n  These local officials care about their communities. They are doing \nall they can amid an avalanche of budget cuts just to meet the ongoing \nneeds of their citizens. It is unfair of the Bush administration and \nthe federal government to leave them high and dry in the face of \nterrorist threats at home. Despite promises of funding from Washington \nto help with these urgent needs, he has received nothing--and this bill \nprovides no new money beyond what administration promised long ago, and \nhas yet to deliver. Washington must do more--much more--to be a real \npartner with our local cities and communities to protect our citizens.\n  I am also deeply concerned that this bill is yet another leap in the \nRepublican campaign to undermine years of progress in protecting our \nenvironment. This bill contains provisions that allow the \nindiscriminate logging of irreplaceable forests, and lays the seeds for \nthe destruction of one of our country's greatest natural treasures, the \nArctic National Wildlife Reserve.\n  In addition, while I commend the fact that this bill represents a \nstep forward\n\n[[Page S2438]]\n\non education, and rejects the administration's anti-education budget, I \nbelieve that parents and teachers and students across the country will \nagree that more should have been done. Education is about fulfilling \nthe hopes and dreams of the next generation. And it is about the \nsecurity and economic future of America.\n  For these reasons I oppose this bill.\n  I ask that unanimous consent that a recent Boston Globe article that \ndescribes what our mayors are doing with little or no Federal help to \nmeet homeland security needs in their communities be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From The Boston Globe, Feb. 9, 2003]\n\nSecurity Costs Rise for Local Officials, Terrorism Alert Puts a Strain \n                               on Budgets\n\n                   (By Megan Tench and Jenna Russell)\n\n       With the nation on heightened alert for terrorist attacks, \n     Massachusetts officials said yesterday that the added \n     responsibility will tax local budgets already facing a fiscal \n     crisis.\n       The Bush administration hiked the terror alert to the \n     second-highest level on Friday as Attorney General John \n     Ashcroft cited an ``increased likelihood'' that the Qaeda \n     terror network would attack Americans, noting that hotels and \n     apartment buildings were possible targets.\n       However, Congress's failure in the last session to provide \n     additional funding for security for cities and towns prompted \n     criticism from several Massachusetts mayors as they attempted \n     to cope with increased security mandates at a time of state \n     aid reductions.\n       ``Obviously there are targets that need to get additional \n     attention, but the fact of the matter is that this is a major \n     concern,'' Worcester's Mayor, Timothy P. Murray, said \n     yesterday.\n       ``We have thousands of police and firefighters out there, \n     yet the president and the Congress failed to supply, equip, \n     and fund these departments,'' Murray said.\n       Like other municipal leaders around the state, Salem Mayor \n     Stanley Usovicz Jr. said cities and towns are on the front \n     line in the war on terrorism, but have not received the money \n     they need to keep up the fight.\n       ``I think everybody is willing and quite able to do their \n     jobs, but no one at the federal and the state level \n     understands that there is a bill to be paid,'' he said. ``We \n     are at war, and . . . I don't know how anyone can fight a war \n     without giving money to the front lines. They cannot continue \n     to ask for more without paying for it.''\n       Still, few residents voiced concern yesterday over the \n     possibility of attacks, which officials said could target \n     Jewish communities or institutions.\n       ``We heard about that on the news, but we are not afraid. \n     We feel safe,'' said George Ullevinov, a Reading resident who \n     was touring the Holocaust Memorial in Boston yesterday with \n     his family.\n       Authorities believe that terrorists connected to Al Qaeda \n     could be planning to time an attack or attacks with the end \n     of the five-day Muslim holy period of the Hajj, the \n     pilgrimage to Mecca, which began yesterday.\n       Officials have been particularly concerned about the use of \n     a ``dirty bomb,'' which would use conventional explosives to \n     disperse radioactive material, but they also cited the \n     possibility of suicide bombings and assassinations.\n       ``Well, we can't run and hide under the bed,'' said Boston \n     resident Philip West, as he checked his luggage with American \n     Airlines at Terminal B at Logan Airport yesterday. West, a \n     helicopter pilot, was headed to Dallas for a pilot's \n     convention.\n       ``We have to go out,'' he said. ``I believe if it's our \n     time to go, it's our time to go.''\n       At Logan, tighter security was visible, with more State \n     Police and trained dogs on patrol and more car inspections on \n     entry to airport garages, during curbside stops, and an \n     additional roadblocks on airport roads.\n       The increased presence seemed to comfort Dorchester \n     resident Marlene Francis, who, along with her 4- and 10-year \n     old children, was preparing for a flight to Jamaica.\n       ``I believe in the security people here, and I try not to \n     think about these things because I am traveling with my \n     children,'' Francis said, as she waited in line at a security \n     checkpoint. ``What's meant to be will be.''\n       At malls and hotels in and around Boston, security \n     directors were reluctant to discuss what precautions they \n     were taking. Law enforcement and transportation officials \n     also were reticent about the heightened alert.\n       FleetCenter managers urged ticket holders to arrive an hour \n     early for a Bruins game yesterday to comply with added \n     security procedures, including the use of metal detectors at \n     entrances. And the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority \n     also increased security to reflect the orange alert, \n     according to spokesman Joseph Pesaturo.\n       The Coast Guard also stepped up patrols around Boston, a \n     spokeswoman said, and the Massachusetts Water Resources \n     Authority increased security and patrols at key spots around \n     the state's water supplies.\n       Bridges also became a focus of attention. ``We've \n     instructed our maintenance people who patrol the roads on a \n     daily basis to be extra vigilant and keep an eye out for any \n     stalled vehicles, particularly near bridges,'' said Jon \n     Carlisle, a spokesman for the Executive Office of \n     Transportation and Construction.\n       Boston's mayor, Thomas M. Menino, could not be reached for \n     comment on the terrorism response yesterday. However, Menino, \n     who also serves as president of the US Conference of Mayors, \n     expressed concerns about the cost of the fight against \n     terrorism during his address to the Greater Boston Chamber of \n     Commerce two months ago.\n       There, Menino announced that he is assembling a national \n     coalition of state and local officials to urge Congress to \n     pass the security funding measure as part of Bush's federal \n     budget proposal when lawmakers return next month.\n       Boston has spent $2.6 million in extra security since Sept. \n     11 terror attacks, Menino said. It's unclear how much the \n     city would reap if the federal package were approved.\n       ``This is money we were promised for police and fire and \n     terrorism protection,'' he said in his address. ``We cannot \n     allow Congress to keep fiddling while the states and cities \n     burn their reserves and exhaust their funds.''\n       Other local officials echoed that sentiment.\n       ``It's a very difficult situation. There are no additional \n     dollars,'' said New Bedford's mayor, Frederick M. Kalisz, \n     whose city is bracing for substantial cuts.\n       ``The alert requires a certain level of patrol visibility \n     at our airport and waterfronts, and the federal dollars just \n     haven't come down to local governments yet,'' he said. ``In a \n     time of taxed dollars, we have to increase the patrols with \n     local patrol officers that we use in our neighborhoods.''\n       In Springfield, Mayor Michael Albano said 57 firefighters \n     will receive layoff notices by Monday, in addition to the 76 \n     police officers he just laid off. Albano said the state \n     budget cuts hurt more than the failure of the federal \n     government to fund local security.\n       Downsizing police and fire departments ``is inconsistent \n     with national policy, and it should be inconsistent with \n     state policy,'' he said. ``The governor has weakened our \n     front lines during a national alert.''\n       Eric Fehrnstrom, a spokesman for Governor Mitt Romney, said \n     federal, state, and local governments ``should spend whatever \n     is necessary'' to protect local cities and towns. ``There has \n     to be more federal involvement,'' he said. ``Governor Romney \n     will stand shoulder to shoulder with the state's mayors in \n     making sure they receive adequate federal dollars to respond \n     to the needs of our local communities.''\n       After the boost in the national alert, Romney flew back to \n     Boston two days early from an Olympics anniversary \n     celebration in Utah, to make sure he would be here in the \n     event of an emergency, Fehrnstrom said.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I rise in opposition to the fiscal year \n2003 omnibus appropriations bill. I oppose this bill because it is a \nsignificant step backward from the bills that the Appropriations \nCommittee reported last year unanimously.\n  The most troubling departure from these committee-passed bills is in \nthe critical area of homeland security. Compared to the levels \nunanimously approved last year by the Senate Appropriations Committee, \nthis bill makes deep cuts in the Transportation Security \nAdministration, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, community \npolicing, FEMA disaster assistance, the DOT Office of Domestic \nPreparedness, firefighter grants, port security, American embassy \nsecurity, and many other homeland security needs.\n  The agricultural disaster assistance provisions in bill are also of \ngreat concern to my State of South Dakota and many other States. The \nprovisions provide limited assistance to producers by cutting important \nconservation assistance in the Farm Bill. The provisions provide only \nhalf the assistance needed to address the scope of natural disaster \nacross the country. Finally, the provision provides assistance to \nselect producers who did not suffer from natural disasters. The Senate \nvoted three times last year for a measure that would have compensated \nall drought victims for their loss. Unfortunately, objections by the \nWhite House and the House Republican leadership stopped this aid from \nmaking it to producers.\n  I am also very concerned about the anti-environmental provisions in \nthe bill. One provision would dramatically expand the forest \nstewardship contracting program until 2013. This provision would \neliminate the current cap on pilot projects and require the Forest \nService and the Bureau of Land Management to open up more than 70 \nmillion acres to potential logging. The timber companies, not the \nForest Service, would pick the trees to be harvested. In addition, the \nbill would eliminate judicial review for the Tongass National Forest \nland management plan; remove language protecting the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge;\n\n[[Page S2439]]\n\nexempt the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System from environmental review; and \ncut funding for important conservation programs.\n  For these reasons, I oppose this conference report and urge my \ncolleagues to oppose it as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent that following the remarks of \nthe distinguished majority leader, the Senate proceed to vote on the \nadoption of the conference report with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, before we vote I will take a minute to \noutline the schedule. This will be the last vote prior to the \nPresidents Day recess. The Senate will be in session tomorrow. However, \nno rollcall votes will occur during Friday's session.\n  At the conclusion of Friday's business, we will adjourn until Monday, \nFebruary 24, under the order. At noon on Monday, February 24, Senator \nChambliss will deliver George Washington's Farewell Address. Following \nthe address, the Senate will resume consideration of the Estrada \nnomination. In addition, on February 24, we will consider S. 151, the \nProtect Act. Members should expect to vote on passage of that bill at \napproximately 5:30. I will notify all Members when the exact time is \nlocked in.\n  I thank all Members for their cooperation during this busy period. \nAgain, this will be the last vote before the recess. The vote will be \nconducted in a few minutes, and the Senate will be in session tomorrow.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, will the majority leader yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. FRIST. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Can Members be assured that there will be no vote prior to \n5:30 on the Monday we come back?\n  Mr. FRIST. That assurance will be given.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is all time yielded back for debate on the \nconference report?\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask that the time of the ranking member \nbe yielded back.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield back all time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the conference \nreport. The yeas and nays have been ordered.

Madam President, the Saltonstall-Kennedy (S-K) Grant \nProgram is a competitive program administered by the National Marine \nFisheries Service of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration, NOAA, Department of Commerce. The S-K program was \nestablished by the Saltonstall-Kennedy Act of 1954 to promote U.S. \nseafood products around the world and generally support our Nation's \nfisheries. For the first time in 1979, S-K receipts from import duties \non fishery products were transferred to NOAA's base budget to fund an \nindustry/government partnership. However, without my amendment in \nfiscal year 2003 NOAA would transfer $75 million to it's base budget, \nleaving only $220,000 for the original purposes of this program--\npromoting domestic seafood production. This provision ensures that a \nlittle less than 15 percent of those receipts transferred to NOAA will \nbe used for their intended purpose--promoting domestic seafood from \nAlaska, home to half of the U.S. domestic seafood production.\n  This bill includes $10 million from the S-K program to market Alaska \nseafood products and creates the Alaska Fisheries Marketing Board to \nadminister these funds. This program will help develop and promote \nhigh-value fresh and fresh-frozen Alaskan seafood products, allowing \nAlaska fishermen to better compete in the global and domestic markets.\n  The Secretary of Commerce will appoint the members of the board and \nthe executive director. In appointing members to the board, the \nSecretary shall fully consult with and seek recommendations from the \nGovernor of Alaska. The membership should reflect the various aspects \nof seafood production, distribution, State oversight and the retail of \nAlaska seafood products. This would include three individuals with \nexperience in harvesting Alaska seafood, two individuals with \nexperience in fish processing, one individual from the Alaska \ntransportation industry, one individual from the Alaska State \nlegislature -preferably with experience on the State of Alaska's Salmon \nTask Force, one individual with experience in mass market food \ndistribution, one individual with experience in mass market food \nretailing, one individual with experience in niche marketing of Alaska \nseafood products, and one individual recommended by the Alaska Seafood \nMarketing Institute.\n  The board will solicit grant proposals for marketing Alaska seafood \nfrom the public, review them, and fund those that will do the most to \nhelp reinvigorate struggling sectors of the Alaska seafood industry. \nThese proposals can promote region-specific or species-specific \nmarketing programs that do not undermine existing statewide ``Alaska \nSeafood'' marketing efforts.\n  The board may choose to promote the development of new processing \ntechnologies to insure the commercial viability of Alaska seafood and \nimprove related transportation costs in delivering these products to \nmarket, and will work to improve the overall marketability of Alaska \nseafood.\n  I look forward to working with the Secretary of Commerce on \nestablishing the Alaska Fisheries Marketing Board and helping the \nAlaska seafood industry get its message out to the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/13/senate-section/article/S2439-3", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2439-S2440]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         HAPPY 100TH ANNIVERSARY TO THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, tomorrow the smallest of our Cabinet\n\n[[Page S2440]]\n\nagencies, the Department of Commerce, will celebrate the biggest of big \nanniversaries, and as the ranking member of the Commerce, Science and \nTransportation Committee, I rise to salute them on 100 years.\n  We have a whole list of their accomplishments, starting with the \ndevelopment of the Gross Domestic Product in the 1930s, the measure \nthat gave us for the first time a true picture of our economy. Commerce \nhouses the Census, the top statistical agency in the world. It is home \nto the Patent Office, which has witnessed an incredible amount of \nAmerican history, issuing more than 6 million patents, be it to Orville \nand Wilbur Wright for a flying machine, or for the development of \ntelevision, transistors, and computers.\n  In the last century, Commerce created the first atomic clock, \nfostered the development of public television; assisted more than half \na million minority-owned businesses; and helped thousands of \neconomically-distressed communities generate commercial development in \nevery Senators' States. Having a hand in creating NOAA, I will always \nremember the last 100 years for the great advancements made in weather \npredicting and the saving of the gray whale and dolphin.\n  When Teddy Roosevelt wrote to this body a century ago, he asked us to \ncreate the Department for the ``purpose of broadening our markets . . . \nand making firm our new position in the international industrial \nworld'' William Redfield, the first Secretary of Commerce, set a clear \ngoal: ``We are going out into the markets of the world to get our \nshare.''\n  This Senator knows that times change and situations change, but that \nfor our long-term economic well being no words hold truer. We need our \nshare to bring back jobs into this country. I wish the good people at \nCommerce a happy birthday. Most of all, I hope President Bush and \nSecretary Evans set their mark on the Department's next 100 years with \ntrade policies that can truly build our economic potential in global \nmarkets.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/13/senate-section/article/S2440-1", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2440]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            RULES OF PROCEDURE OF THE SENATE RULES COMMITTEE\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Meetings of the committee, including meetings to conduct \n     hearings, shall be open to the public, except that a meeting \n     or series of meetings by the committee on the same subject \n     for a period of no more than 14 calendar days may be closed \n     to the public on a motion made and seconded to go into closed \n     session to discuss only whether the matters enumerated in \n     subparagraphs (A) through (F) would require the meeting to be \n     closed followed immediately by a recorded vote in open \n     session by a majority of the members of the committee when it \n     is determined that the matters to be discussed or the \n     testimony to be taken at such meeting or meetings--\n       (A) will disclose matters necessary to be kept secret in \n     the interests of national defense or the confidential conduct \n     of the foreign relations of the United States;\n       (B) will relate solely to matters of the committee staff \n     personnel or internal staff management or procedure;\n       (C) will tend to charge an individual with crime or \n     misconduct, to disgrace or injure the professional standing \n     of an individual, or otherwise to expose an individual to \n     public contempt or obloquy, or will represent a clearly \n     unwarranted invasion of the privacy of an individual;\n       (D) will disclose the identity of any informer or law \n     enforcement agent or will disclose any information relating \n     to the investigation or prosecution of a criminal offense \n     that is required to be kept secret in the interests of \n     effective law enforcement;\n       (E) will disclose information relating to the trade secrets \n     or financial or commercial information pertaining \n     specifically to a given person if--\n       (1) an Act of Congress requires the information to be kept \n     confidential by Government officers and employees; or\n       (2) the information has been obtained by the Government on \n     a confidential basis, other than through an application by \n     such person for a specific Government financial or other \n     benefit, and is required to be kept secret in order to \n     prevent undue injury to the competitive position of such \n     person; or\n       (F) may divulge matters required to be kept confidential \n     under the provisions of law or Government regulations. \n     (Paragraph 5(b) of rule XXVI of the Standing Rules.)\n       3. Written notices of committee meetings will normally be \n     sent by the committee's staff director to all members of the \n     committee at least a week in advance. In addition, the \n     committee staff will telephone reminders of committee \n     meetings to all members of the committee or to the \n     appropriate staff assistants in their offices.\n       4. A copy of the committee's intended agenda enumerating \n     separate items of legislative business and committee business \n     will normally be sent to all members of the committee by the \n     staff director at least 1 day in advance of all meetings. \n     This does not preclude any member of the committee from \n     raising appropriate non-agenda topics.\n       5. Any witness who is to appear before the committee in any \n     hearing shall file with the clerk of the committee at least 3 \n     business days before the date of his or her appearance, a \n     written statement of his or her proposed testimony and an \n     executive summary thereof, in such form as the chairman may \n     direct, unless the Chairman and the Ranking Minority Member \n     waive such requirement for good cause.\n\n\n                           TITLE II--QUORUMS\n\n       1.

Pursuant to paragraph 7(a)(2) of rule XXVI of the \n     Standing Rules, 2 members of the committee shall constitute a \n     quorum for the purpose of taking testimony under oath and 1 \n     member of the committee shall constitute a quorum for the \n     purpose of taking testimony not under oath; provided, \n     however, that in either instance, once a quorum is \n     established, any one member can continue to take such \n     testimony.\n       4. Under no circumstances may proxies be considered for the \n     establishment of a quorum.\n\n\n                           TITLE III--VOTING\n\n       1. Voting in the committee on any issue will normally be by \n     voice vote.\n       2. If a third of the members present so demand, a record \n     vote will be taken on any question by roll call.\n       3. The results of roll call votes taken in any meeting upon \n     any measure, or any amendment thereto, shall be stated in the \n     committee report on that measure unless previously announced \n     by the committee, and such report or announcement shall \n     include a tabulation of the votes cast in favor of and the \n     votes cast in opposition to each such measure and amendment \n     by each member of the committee.

The presiding officer at any hearing is authorized \n     to limit the time of each witness appearing before the \n     committee or a subcommittee.

In the event there are \n     supplemental, minority, or additional views, an appropriate \n     opportunity shall be given the majority to examine the \n     proposed text prior to filing or publication. Unless the \n     chairman and ranking minority member agree on a shorter \n     period of time, the minority shall have no fewer than three \n     business days to prepare supplemental, minority or additional \n     views for inclusion in a committee report from the time the \n     majority makes the proposed text of the committee report \n     available to the minority.\n       Rule 17.--(a) The committee, or any subcommittee, may issue \n     subpoenas, or hold hearings to take sworn testimony or hear \n     subpoenaed witnesses, only if such investigative activity has \n     been authorized by majority vote of the committee.\n       (b) For the purpose of holding a hearing to take sworn \n     testimony or hear subpoenaed witnesses, three members of the \n     committee or subcommittee shall constitute a quorum: \n     provided, with the concurrence of the chairman and ranking \n     minority members of the committee or subcommittee, a single \n     member may hear subpoenaed witnesses or take sworn testimony.\n       (c) The committee may, by a majority vote, delegate the \n     authority to issue subpoenas to the chairman of the committee \n     or a subcommittee, or to any member designated by such \n     chairman. Prior to the issuance of each subpoena, the ranking \n     minority member of the committee or subcommittee, and any \n     other member of the committee or subcommittee, and any other \n     member so requesting, shall be notified regarding the \n     identity of the person to whom it will be issued and the \n     nature of the information sought and its relationship to the \n     authorized investigative activity, except where the chairman \n     of the committee or subcommittee, in consultation with the \n     ranking minority member, determines that such notice would \n     unduly impede the investigation. All information obtained \n     pursuant to such investigative activity shall be made \n     available as promptly as possible to each member of the \n     committee requesting same, or to any assistant to a member of \n     the committee designated by such member in writing, but the \n     use of any such information is subject to restrictions \n     imposed by the rules of the Senate. Such information, to the \n     extent that it is relevant to the investigation shall, if \n     requested by a member, be summarized in writing as soon as \n     practicable. Upon the request of any member, the chairman \n     of the committee or subcommittee shall call an executive \n     session to discuss such investigative activity or the \n     issuance of any subpoena in connection therewith.\n       (d) Any witness summoned to testify at a hearing, or any \n     witness giving sworn testimony, may be accompanied by counsel \n     of his own choosing who shall be permitted, which the witness \n     is testifying, to advise him of his legal rights.\n       (e) No confidential testimony taken or confidential \n     material presented in an executive hearing, or any report of \n     the proceedings of such an executive hearing, shall be made \n     public, either in whole or in part or by way of summary, \n     unless authorized by a majority of the members of the \n     committee or subcommittee.\n       Rule 18.--Presidential nominees shall submit a statement of \n     their background and financial interests, including the \n     financial interests of their spouse and children living in \n     their household, on a form approved by the\n\n[[Page S2442]]\n\n     committee which shall be sworn to as to its completeness and \n     accuracy.

Information relating to other \n     background and financial interests (part II) shall not be \n     required of any nominee when the committee determines that it \n     is not relevant to the nature of the position.\n       Committee action on a nomination, including hearings or \n     meetings to consider a motion to recommend confirmation, \n     shall not be initiated until at least five days after the \n     nominee submits the form required by this rule unless the \n     chairman, with the concurrence of the ranking minority \n     member, waives this waiting period.\n       Rule 19.--Subject to statutory requirements imposed on the \n     committee with respect to procedure, the rules of the \n     committee may be changed, modified, amended or suspended at \n     any time; provided, not less than a majority of the entire \n     membership so determine at a regular meeting with due notice, \n     or at a meeting specifically called for that purpose.\n       Rule 20.--When the ratio of members on the committee is \n     even, the term ``majority'' as used in the committee's rules \n     and guidelines shall refer to the party of the chairman for \n     purposes of party identification. Numerical requirements for \n     quorums, votes and the like shall be unaffected.\n       Rule 21.--First degree amendments must be filed with the \n     chairman at least 24 hours before an executive session.

Each standing committee, including any subcommittee of \n     any such committee, is authorized to hold such hearings, to \n     sit and act at such times and places during the sessions, \n     recesses, and adjourned periods of the Senate, to require by \n     subpoena or otherwise the attendance of such witnesses and \n     the production of such correspondence, books, papers, and \n     documents, to take such testimony and to make such \n     expenditures out of the contingent fund of the Senate as may \n     be authorized by resolutions of the Senate.

The majority leader or his designee shall \n     announce to the Senate whenever consent has been given under \n     this subparagraph and shall state the time and place of such \n     meeting. The right to make such announcement of consent shall \n     have the same priority as the filing of a cloture motion.\n       (b) Each meeting of a committee, or any subcommittee \n     thereof, including meetings to conduct hearings, shall be \n     open to the public, except that a meeting or series of \n     meetings by a committee or a subcommittee thereof on the same \n     subject for a period of no more than fourteen calendar days \n     may be closed to the public on a motion made and seconded to \n     go into closed session to discuss only whether the matters \n     enumerated in clauses (1) through (6) would require the \n     meeting to be closed, followed immediately by a record vote \n     in open session by a majority of the members of the committee \n     or subcommittee when it is determined that the matters to be \n     discussed or the testimony to be taken at such meeting or \n     meetings--\n       (1) will disclose matters necessary to be kept secret in \n     the interests of national defense or the confidential conduct \n     of the foreign relations of the United States;\n       (2) will relate solely to matters of committee staff \n     personnel or internal staff management or procedure;\n       (3) will tend to charge an individual with crime or \n     misconduct, to disgrace or injure the professional standing \n     of an individual, or otherwise to expose an individual to \n     public contempt or obloquy or will represent a clearly \n     unwarranted invasion of the privacy of an individual;\n       (4) will disclose the identity of any informer or law \n     enforcement agent or will disclose any information relating \n     to the investigation or prosecution of a criminal offense \n     that is required to be kept secret in the interests of \n     effective law enforcement;\n       (5) will disclose information relating to the trade secrets \n     of financial or commercial information pertaining \n     specifically to a given person if--\n       (A) an Act of Congress requires the information to be kept \n     confidential by Government officers and employees; or\n       (B) the information has been obtained by the Government on \n     a confidential basis, other than through an application by \n     such person for a specific Government financial or other \n     benefit, and is required to be kept secret in order to \n     prevent undue injury to the competitive position of such \n     person; or\n       (6) may divulge matters required to be kept confidential \n     under other provisions of law or Government regulations.\n       (c) Whenever any hearing conducted by any such committee or \n     subcommittee is open to the public, that hearing may be \n     broadcast by radio or television, or both, under such rules \n     as the committee or subcommittee may adopt.\n       (d) Whenever disorder arises during a committee meeting \n     that is open to the public, or any demonstration of approval \n     or disapproval is indulged in by any person in attendance of \n     any such meeting, it shall be the duty of the Chair to \n     enforce order on his own initiative and without any point of \n     order being made by a Senator. When the Chair finds it \n     necessary to maintain order, he shall have the power to clear \n     the room, and the committee may act in closed session for so \n     long as there is doubt of the assurance of order.\n       (e) Each committee shall prepare and keep a complete \n     transcript or electronic recoding adequate to fully record \n     the proceeding of each meeting or conference where or not \n     such meeting or any part thereof is closed under this \n     paragraph, unless a majority of its members vote to forgo \n     such a record.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n  Guidelines of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions With Respect to Hearings, Markup Sessions, and Related Matters\n\n\n                                Hearings\n\n       Section 133A(a) of the Legislative Reorganization Act \n     requires each committee of the\n\n[[Page S2443]]\n\n     Senate to publicly announce the date, place, and subject \n     matter of any hearing at least one week prior to the \n     commencement of such hearing.\n       The spirit of this requirement is to assure adequate notice \n     to the public and other Members of the Senate as to the time \n     and subject matter of proposed hearings. In the spirit of \n     section 133A(a) and in order to assure that members of the \n     committee are themselves fully informed and involved in the \n     development of hearings:\n       1. Public notice of the date, place, and subject matter of \n     each committee or subcommittee hearing should be inserted in \n     the Congressional Record seven days prior to the commencement \n     of such hearing.\n       2. At least seven days prior to public notice of each \n     committee or subcommittee hearing, the majority should \n     provide notice to the minority of the time, place and \n     specific subject matter of such hearing.\n       3. At least three days prior to the date of such hearing, \n     the committee or subcommittee should provide to each member a \n     list of witnesses who have been or are proposed to be invited \n     to appear.\n       4.

Madam President, last Sunday the news program ``60 \nMinutes'' reported on an exciting new technology called ballistic \nfingerprinting, which is currently underutilized by our Nation's law \nenforcement organizations. Each time a gun is fired, it inscribes a \nunique pattern on each bullet. This marking is referred to as a \nballistic fingerprint. The ``60 Minutes'' report presented the case of \na New York City double homicide in which the New York Police Department \ndeveloped little evidence to work with besides the bullet shells and \ncasings from the crime scene. After exhausting all other efforts to \nsolve the case, detectives took those shells and casings to the NYPD \nballistics lab to be scanned into the Integrated Ballistic \nIdentification System, a database of ballistic fingerprints maintained \nby the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives. \nThe ballistics lab was able to connect the gun used in the double \nhomicide to the one used three months later in an armed robbery. An \narrest was made and the man was convicted of both crimes. Without \nballistics fingerprinting this case might have never been solved.\n  Through its National Integrated Ballistic Information Network or \nNIBIN Program, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives \ndeploys Integrated Ballistic Identification System equipment to State \nand local law enforcement agencies, such as the one in New York City, \nfor their use in imaging and comparing crime gun evidence. This state-\nof-the-art equipment allows firearms technicians to acquire digital \nimages of the markings made by a firearm on bullets and shells, like \nwas done in the New York case. Unfortunately, at this point, only \nweapons that are confiscated in crimes are included in this database. \nExpanding this database to include newly manufactured and imported guns \nwould enhance law enforcement's ability to investigate and reduce gun-\nrelated crime.\n  I believe that the ATF's ballistic fingerprinting network should be \nexpanded, and that is why I have cosponsored the Technological Resource \nfor Assisting Criminal Enforcement Act or TRACE Act. Under this bill, \nmanufacturers and importers would be required to test fire firearms and \ncapture ballistics images of the fired bullets and casings of new \nfirearms. Expanding NIBIN to include these ballistics images would \nincrease the crime gun tracing capabilities of the ATF and local law \nenforcement. Law enforcement could identify firearms by using the \nballistics images of cartridge cases and bullets recovered at crime \nscenes even when criminals had removed the serial number. In fact, this \ntechnology would allow investigators to identify the firearm used in \nthe crime without actually recovering that firearm. The legislation \nalso contains strict provisions stating that the ballistics information \nregarding individual guns may not be used for prosecutorial purposes \nunless law enforcement officials have a reasonable belief that a crime \nhas been committed and that ballistics information would assist in the \ninvestigation of that crime.\n  I believe this is sensible legislation that will strengthen law \nenforcement's ability to effectively track down criminals. This \ntechnology has worked for both the NYPD and in the investigation of the \nWashington area sniper attacks. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/13/senate-section/article/S2446-2", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2446]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Madam President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. In the last Congress Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Act, a bill that would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence \nof any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred March 9, 2002 \nin Huntington Beach, CA. Aris Gaddvang, 25, a Filipino-American store \nmanager, was beaten in a parking lot. The attackers, three teenagers, \nshouted racial slurs and ``white power'' before beating Gaddvang with \nmetal pipes. After the attack, Gaddvang said he received a phone call \nfrom someone who identified himself as one of the attackers. Gaddvang \nsaid that the caller used racial slurs and threatened him.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/13/senate-section/article/S2446-3", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2446-S2447]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     SUPPORTING THE USE OF ETHANOL\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Madam President, I rise today to express my support \nfor the ethanol legislation that is being introduced today.\n  I am pleased to join my colleagues, Senators Hagel, Lugar, Daschle, \nand Johnson, in this effort to develop an ethanol package that \naddresses the concerns of a variety of stakeholders in the energy \ndebate while providing a tangible benefit for the American people. I \nbelieve that increasing our use of renewable fuels such as ethanol and \nbiodiesel is a key element in our effort to construct a viable energy \npolicy.\n  As I have often stated, we face an incredible challenge in putting \ntogether an energy policy for our Nation. In my view, the Senate has a \nresponsibility to develop a policy that harmonizes energy and \nenvironmental policies, and to acknowledge that the economy and the \nenvironment are vitally intertwined.\n  As I has to be a policy that broadens our base of energy resources to \ncreate stability, guarantee reasonable prices, and protect America's \nsecurity. It has to be a policy that will keep energy affordable. \nFinally, it has to be a policy that won't cripple the engines of \ncommerce that fund the research that will yield future environmental \nprotection technologies.\n\n[[Page S2447]]\n\n  I believe the passage of an ethanol bill will protect our energy \nindependence, our economy, and our environment.\n  Increasing the use of renewable fuels such as ethanol will protect \nour energy independence. Given the current situation in the Middle \nEast, perhaps our greatest energy challenge is to reduce our reliance \non foreign sources to meet our energy needs. As my colleagues know, the \nUnited States currently imports about 58 percent of our crude oil. \nPresident Bush has stated repeatedly that energy security is a \ncornerstone for national security and it is crucial that we become less \ndependent on foreign sources of oil and look more to domestic sources \nto meet our energy needs. Ethanol is an excellent domestic source--it \nis a clean burning, home-grown renewable fuel that we can rely on for \ngenerations to come.\n  Creating a greater market for ethanol will protect our economy. \nEthanol is good for our Nation's economy and, in particular, good for \nOhio's economy. Ohio is sixth in the Nation in terms of corn \nproduction, and an increase in the use of ethanol across the Nation \nmeans an economic boost to thousands of farm families across my State. \nOhio is one of the Nation's leading consumers of ethanol, with 40 \npercent of the gasoline consumed in the State containing ethanol. \nBecause of the economic benefits of increasing consumption of ethanol, \nOhio has placed a tremendous emphasis on expanding its use and is \nactively pursuing opportunities to build ethanol production plants.\n  Expanding the use of ethanol will protect our environment. Increasing \nthe use of ethanol will help reduce auto emissions, which will clean \nthe air and improve public health.\n  The language that is being introduced today is identical to the \nethanol title passed by the Senate in last year's comprehensive energy \nbill. It is important to note that while this body overwhelmingly \nsupported inclusion of an ethanol title in that bill, there were some \nsignificant issues raised during debate on this provision.\n  As chairman of the Clean Air Subcommittee, I intend to hold hearings \non, and to mark up, this legislation so that it can be included in this \nCongress' version of comprehensive energy legislation. I know that \nSenator Inhofe, Chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, \nhas some strong issues with the way that MTBE is dealt with in this \nlegislation, and I intend to work closely with him to see that those \nissues are resolved before we move forward with this bill.\n  I was delighted that the Senate was able to come together and craft a \nbipartisan agreement on ethanol during the last Congress. It is my hope \nthat that spirit of bipartisanship will continue throughout this \nCongress and that we can finally enact a comprehensive national energy \npolicy that includes ethanol as one of its key provisions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/13/senate-section/article/S2447-1", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2447-S2448]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     DEPLOYMENT OF TROOPS IN EUROPE\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Madam President, I rise today to speak for a few moments \nabout, what I feel, is a very important issue--regarding NATO and the \ndeployment of great armed forces in Europe.\n  I, like many of my colleagues, have watched and listened with concern \nto some of our European allies' thoughts and actions regarding the \ninspections in Iraq.\n  It has caused many in this town, both in this Chamber and in the \ngovernment to ponder the merits of some of our allies that are new \nmembers of NATO . . . and the fine job they have done in supporting \nthis Nation on fledgling budgets but with the heart of gold and fervor \nof patriotism often found in new democracies.\n  I believe that it is high time that we consider the merits of a \nlimited redeployment of some U.S. forces either on a permanent or \nrotating basis from Germany to alternative locations in Eastern and \nSouthern Europe.\n  The current alignment of U.S. forces in Europe, particularly their \nconcentration in Germany, reflects a geopolitical reality that no \nlonger exists. There has not been significant enough realignment of \ncapabilities and assets since the fall of the Berlin Wall.\n  We no longer expect Soviet tanks to come rolling over the Folda Gap. \nWhy are U.S. forces, therefore, still on a cold war footing?\n  During the 1990s, America and its allies agonized over the future of \nNATO. Now that we have reaffirmed that NATO will continue to exist and \ngrow, and that the U.S. will remain engaged in Europe, we should ask \nourselves what it should look like and how it can best serve our \nnational and common security interests.\n  As attention turns to the Middle East, we should be thinking about \nwhere our troops should be stationed over the longer term. Given that \nthe military flashpoints in the future are likely to revolve around the \nCaucuses, Iraq, the Middle East and North Africa, closer proximity of \nU.S. troops is of the utmost necessity.\n  Since Berlin has long ceased to be the fault line for military \nconflict, I urge my colleagues and the Administration to consider \nredeploying U.S. troops from Germany in a direction, and in a manner, \nthat reflects the challenges of the future rather than the past.\n  I was proud to support the inclusion of Czech Republic, Hungary and \nPoland into NATO. I am also supportive of the aspiration of others to \njoin that Alliance and to make the democratic and budgetary reforms \nnecessary to bolster their candidacy.\n  I am proud that seven other nations, including Bulgaria and Romania, \nare candidates for membership.\n  By deploying U.S. forces to new locations to the East or South of \nGermany, to nations that enjoy new or prospective membership in NATO, \nwe would demonstrate our firm commitment to those countries.\n  Doing so would also reflect new geopolitical realities: first, we \nhave cooperative and constructive relations with Russia, and secondly, \npoints to the south of Europe will continue to require more of our \nattention.\n  As Secretary Rumsfeld has noted, while ties between the people of \nGermany and America remain strong, on a governmental level, our \nbilateral relations are increasingly out of sync.\n  I couldn't agree more.\n  Well before Mr. Schroeder began his attacks on President Bush and \nbefore the incessant German criticism of the administration's efforts \nto combat terrorism and the threat posed by Iraq--Germany had imposed \nincreasing and burdensome restrictions on the way the U.S. military \ncould maneuver and train in Germany.\n  Basing and operating costs in Germany one of the most industrialized \nand rich nations of Europe are high. Though start-up costs of \nrelocating some U.S. forces to countries such as Poland or Romania \nmight be high, over time such relocation would present savings.\n  Some Eastern or Southern European countries would be keen to host \nU.S. forces, either permanently or on a rotating basis.\n  They would welcome a U.S. military presence for the strategic and \npolitical dividends involved, and not least for the positive economic \nimpact that this would entail. They would welcome us in the spirit of \nfriendship.\n  In particular, I think the administration should strongly consider \nredeploying NATO forces to Poland, Romania and Bulgaria. Poland has \nbases and training grounds well-suited for U.S. military training, \nwhile Romania and Bulgaria are both in the process of upgrading their \nbases under the terms of their NATO membership.\n  Operating with fewer restrictions than on German bases will allow \nAmerican troops to train more effectively, thus maintaining military \nreadiness at the highest possible level.\n  Redeployment of U.S. forces to Romania and/or Bulgaria would ease \nstrategic pressure on Turkey, a vital American ally.\n  With its location near the center of the world's least stable \nregions, we should not leave Ankara to stand as the sole pressure point \nwhen the U.S. projects forces eastward and southward from Europe.\n  Someday the political situation might force even a generally friendly \nTurkish government to resist America using Turkey as a staging point. \nAmerican bases in Bulgaria and Romania would shift some of the burden \nfrom this hard-pressed American friend.\n  Likewise, bases in Bulgaria and Romania would provide the Turks, who \nwill remain key partners in the new era, the diplomatic cover to \ncontinue to assist the U.S.\n  Nations that have escaped the yoke of communism in Central and \nSouthern\n\n[[Page S2448]]\n\nEurope have been among the most active and outspoken supporters of U.S. \npolicy particularly the global war on terrorism and U.S. efforts to \ncontain Iraq and North Korea.\n  Perhaps that is because these nations, unlike their continental \nneighbors to the West, know what it is like to live without security, \nfreedom and democracy.\n  As we move forward on this critical issue, Congress should authorize \nand the Administration should thoroughly study, the military and \nfinancial implications of European redeployment.\n  It is also an issue to broach with the Russian Federation, as it may \nrequire renegotiation of the Treaty Conventional Armed Forces in \nEurope. We must emphasize that it is not directed at Moscow but rather \ncan form the basis of a closer NATO-Russia relationship.\n  I would note that a few days ago, Senators Shelby, Bunning, Allard, \nCollins, Sessions, Brownback, McCain, Kyl, Hutchinson, Craig, Ensign, \nSantorum, Warner and I sent a letter to Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld \nrequesting that the Department of Defense undertake an immediate study \nof U.S. bases in Europe that should be geared to U.S. national \ninterests.\n  We asked that issues considered in such a study include, but not be \nlimited to: force structure, length of deployment, infrastructure, \ndependents and dependent housing and services, and costs regardless of \ncategory.\n  I believe that was a good first step toward thinking about the issue \nof deployment of our forces in Europe.

This legislation makes \nimportant improvements to the current Medicare Incentive Payment (MIP) \nProgram. These refinements will go a long way in ensuring eligible \nrural physicians receive the Medicare bonus payment to which they are \nentitled.\n  The Medicare Incentive Payment Program was created in 1987 under the \nOmnibus Budget Reconciliation Act to serve as an incentive tool to \nrecruit physicians to practice in Health Professional Shortage Areas \n(HPSAs) by providing a 10 percent Medicare bonus payment. There are \napproximately 2,800 federally designated HPSA's--75 percent of which \nare located in rural areas. In my State of Wyoming, over half of the \ncounties are designated as a Health Professional Shortage Area and have \na difficult time recruiting physicians.\n  Unfortunately, this well-intended program has not worked well due to \nthe burden if places on providers. Under the current MIP programmatic \nstructure, physicians are required to determine if the patient \nencounter occurred in designated underserved areas, they must attach a \ncode modifier to the billing claim and must undergo a stringent audit. \nAdditionally, there is evidence that many physicians who would be \neligible are not even aware of the program.\n  The legislation we are introducing today alleviates the \nadministrative burden on rural physicians by requiring Medicare \ncarriers to determine eligibility. The Medicare Incentive Payment \nProgram Improvement Act of 2003 also requires the Centers for Medicare \nand Medicaid Services to establish a MIP education program for \nproviders and establishes ongoing analysis of the MIP program's ability \nto improve access to physician services for Medicare beneficiaries.\n  All physicians are struggling with last year's Medicare payment \nreduction of 5.4 percent and with the possibility of another 4.4 \npercent reduction on March 1 of this year. These payment cuts combined \nwith an ever-increasing regulatory burden to participate in the \nMedicare program and escalating medical malpractice premiums have begun \nto impact senors' access to care. As rural providers tend to be \ndisproportionately impacted by Medicare payment cuts, it has never been \nmore important to ensure that the few rural physician incentive \nprograms that exist have a positive effect on the stability of our \nrural health care delivery system. I strongly urge all my Senate \ncolleagues interested in rural health to cosponsor the Medicare \nIncentive Payment Improvement Act of 2003\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/13/senate-section/article/S2448-2", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2448-S2450]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONSERVATION SECURITY PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I came to Congress in 1975 and served in \nthe House until 1984, when I was elected to the Senate. As a member of \nthe House Agriculture Committee and later the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee I have always known the importance of agriculture \nconservation. My home State of Iowa is rich in agriculture and also \nrich in the tradition of conservation.\n  But even in Iowa, we recognize the need for more conservation. For \ndecades we had cost-share money available for producers through the \nAgriculture Conservation Program. But, it was not\n\n[[Page S2449]]\n\nuntil 1990 that a farm bill took the next critical step toward \nconservation by including my Water Quality Incentives Program. This \nprogram, for the first time in agriculture history, included incentive \npayments for producers. The basic concepts and principles of WQIP were \nthe foundation for the Environmental Quality Incentives Program, EQIP, \nincluded in the 1996 farm bill. EQIP, which expanded beyond water \nquality to all natural resources, was a fundamental advancement for \nconservation on working lands.\n  However, even with these advances we were still spending over 90 \npercent of conservation dollars on land retirement programs, namely CRP \nand WRP. While these two programs are critically important, it became \nabundantly clear that conservation on working lands needed to be \naddressed. EQIP was hugely popular among farmers and ranchers, but the \ndollars were limited and many, many, many producers were left \nstranded--unable to access this program.\n  Moreover, a growing resentment from good conservationists was brewing \nover the EQIP funding. Too many good stewards of their lands were left \nout of the conservation programs. Those who worked hard, using their \nown resources and ingenuity, were not recognized by USDA agriculture \nconservation programs.\n  As I traveled the countryside, it became abundantly clear that change \nwas necessary. I heard from many producers that we finally needed a \ngood strong conservation program open to all producers, not just a few \nselect producers. And, they told me that we needed a conservation \nprogram that rewarded those committed stewards of the land, instead of \nexcluding them.\n  During the development of the farm bill, I continued to press for an \nexpanded conservation title. To expand and improve the existing \nconservation programs and to finally add a new conservation program \nwhich I called the Conservation Security Program--a program to secure \nthe right of all American farmers and ranchers to access \nconservation dollars to adopt and maintain conservation practices on \ntheir lands. We did not put a cap on the CSP so that all producers who \nwould carry out conservation and meet the requirements could enroll in \nit. The CSP was a novel approach to conservation--it adopted the well-\naccepted full participation principle in our commodity programs. That \nis the most unique factor of CSP. I first proposed CSP in 1999 and over \nthe next three years CSP evolved into the groundbreaking program that \nwas included in the 2002 farm bill. Prior to the final product, the CSP \nwas introduced in a bipartisan manner on both the House and the Senate \nin 2001.\n\n  Senator Smith of Oregon and I worked hard on developing this \nimportant program. It took long hours of negotiation involving staff \ntogether with major commodity groups, like the American Farm Bureau \nFederation, the American Soybean Association, National Corn Growers \nAssociation, Sustainable Agriculture Coalition, Defenders of Wildlife, \nSierra Club and many others. Moreover, we worked extensively with the \nUSDA. Eventually, we developed a program embraced by both commodity and \nconservation groups alike.\n  But, the evolution of CSP continued through the development of the \nfarm bill. As the Senate worked on the farm bill, Senator Lugar, \nSenator Smith and I continued to modify the CSP to ensure that the \nenvironmental benefits were maximized and that farmer access was \nparamount. Senator Lugar and I developed joint principles on the farm \nbill, including for the conservation title. While both Senator Lugar \nand I vocally supported a strong conservation title, we took time to \nrefine the CSP. As a result of our bipartisan work, the conservation \ntitle, including a CSP without an arbitrary funding limit of the Senate \nAgriculture Committee unanimously.\n  But, our work on the CSP was far from over. As we moved into \nconference with the House, we again worked to improve CSP. We worked \ntirelessly and carefully to refine the CSP and make sure that it was \nacceptable to all members of conference. This was not a simple process. \nThe Farm bill conference took months, and the conservation title was \ndebated during the entire process. I personally engaged in weeks of \nnegotiations on the CSP. Because I understood the critical importance \nof including a CSP without a funding cap in the final bill, I made many \nconcessions on the farm bill.\n  Finally, after months of debate, the conference agreed to include CSP \nas an uncapped program--one open to all producers who meet requirements \nof the program and one that would have a budget baseline in the future \nas the program grew. The farm bill was a carefully negotiated bill that \nrequired a delicate balancing of all concerns.\n  When President Bush signed the 2002 farm bill last May, we all \ncelebrated the historic increase in conservation spending for existing \nand new programs. For the first time ever, the farm bill took a \nmonumental step forward toward truly addressing conservation of natural \nresources on our farms and ranches in the form of the CSP.\n\n  The CSP, by its uncapped nature, ensured for the first time that all \nfarmers and ranchers who meet the requirements may participate in an \nagriculture conservation program. Again, it was uncapped nature of this \nprogram that provided for this program that provided for this giant \nstep for conservation--for both our farmers and ranchers and the \nenvironment.\n  I must restate that the CSP will generate real environment benefits. \nThe design of CSP mandate these benefits. Producers are required to \nmaintain or adopt conservation practices at the highest level of all \nconservation programs.\n  Why else is CSP so important? For many reasons--It is the first \nprogram that provides a comprehensive approach covering the full range \nof conservation and environmental issues related to working lands, and \nenables participation based on one unified, site-specific conservation \nplan.\n  CSP helps rebalance conservation funding in support of incentives for \nland in production so that producers don't have to retireland and stop \nfarming in order to benefit. CSP is open to producers of all types of \ncrops and all parts of the country. CSP, for the first time, pays \nproducers in recognition of the public nature resource and \nenvironmental benefits provided on working farms and ranches, including \nmaintenance payments for active management of already adopted \npractices. And, CSP is compatible with our trade obligations under WTO.\n  That is why major commodity and conservation groups support CSP. \nGroups including, Cotton Council, American Farm Bureau Federation, \nAmerican Soybean Association, National Association of Wheat Growers, \nNational Corn Growers Association, National Farmers Union, National \nMilk Producers Federation, United Fresh Fruits & Vegetables, U.S. Rice \nProducers, American Farmland Trust, Defenders of Wildlife, National \nAssociation of Conservation Districts, National Audubon Society, \nPheasants Forever, Sierra Club, Trout Unlimited, Union of Concerned \nScientists and many more. Despite the Administration's contention that \nit supports voluntary conservation programs in the farm bill, we have \nfound that their words are not matched by their actions. In fact, the \nAdministration has actively worked to undermine conservation programs.\n\n  Just recently, the Administration described CSP as having ``a unique \nrole among USDA conservation programs. It identifies and rewards those \nfarmers and ranchers who meet the highest standards of conservation and \nenvironmental management on their operations, creates powerful \nincentives for other producers to meet those same standards of \nconservation performance on their operations, and provides public \nbenefits for generations to come.''\n  Despite this glowing endorsement, the Administration has attacked \nCSP--by proposing to cut back CSP to a strict $2 billion for 10 years \nin the FY04 budget and by pushing to cap CSP to only $3.77 billion in \nthis omnibus appropriations bill. The manner in which the CSP was \ncapped was unfair. It began with a small provision in the House \nagriculture appropriations bill by limiting CSP as a pilot program in \nFY03 in my home state of Iowa.\n  But as time went on and the majority developed an inadequate disaster \nbill--one that doesn't provide the necessary support farmers need, they \ndecided they needed an offset for the program. So, for the first time, \nwe have\n\n[[Page S2450]]\n\nnow created a horrible precedent of requiring an offset for disaster \npayments. And, where did the Administration go for this offset? The \nfarm bill which was just passed nine months ago. And, more importantly, \nwhat did the Administration attack first--the conservation title.\n  During the farm bill, the CSP was scored by CBO for $2 billion, but \nas the popularity and producer support and excitement for this program \ngrew, CBO rescored this program for significantly more. In fact, the \nmost recent score for CSP is $6.8 billion. Instead of seeing a \nwonderful vehicle to accomplish conservation on the ground, the Bush \nAdministration viewed CSP as a cash cow--one to attack to pay for \ndisaster payments. So, without any ability for debate, in the quiet of \nthe night behind closed doors the Administration undermined the most \nimportant conservation program ever authorized--a conservation program \nopen to all producers and capped the CSP. This cap fundamentally \nchanges the CSP.\n  No longer can all producers have the security of knowing they can \nparticipate in a conservation program, no longer can the promised \nenvironmental benefits of the conservation title of the farm bill \nguaranteed. By capping this program--unintended restrictions on \nparticipation will follow and the baseline we worked so hard to develop \nand so carefully negotiated in the farm bill is gone. And, we have \ngreatly hindered the most promising program we had for meeting our WTO \nobligations in the future.\n  It is clear today that the Administration is bent on undermining \nconservation practices and the CSP. It is clear that its words of \npraise for conservation cannot be reconciled with its destructive \nmeasures.\n  The colloquy between Senator Stevens, Senator Cochran, Senator \nDaschle, Senator Frist and me entered into on passage of the Omnibus \nAppropriations bill on February 13, will hopefully lead to correcting \nthis mistake on the next supplemental appropriations bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a statement by Congressman Goodlatte be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         [From the House Agriculture Committee, Feb. 13, 2003]\n\n Chairman Goodlatte's Statement Concerning the Final Omnibus Spending \n               Bill and the Drought Assistance Provision\n\n       ``We are pleased that the final drought assistance \n     provision provides targeted disaster relief to those farmers \n     who need it the most. It is my hope that this approach will \n     help countless American farmers avoid devastating financial \n     circumstances. I am pleased that it is paid for.\n       ``However, the Committee is greatly concerned that it is \n     paid for out of a carefully negotiated Farm Bill, and would \n     have preferred that the funds had been found elsewhere. \n     Breaking open the Farm Bill, before it has even been \n     implemented, is a very serious matter. This is a dangerous \n     precedent, which we strongly opposed throughout the course of \n     these negotiations.\n       ``This is a warning to farm legislators and the farm \n     community at large to be vigilant. It will be a constant \n     effort to ensure that the Farm Bill remains a valuable asset \n     to America's farmers and ranchers. While this legislation \n     will help farmers who are hurting right now, we must make \n     certain that in providing this assistance, we don't harm \n     American agriculture in the long term.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/13/senate-section/article/S2450-1", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2450]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          UNINSURED AMERICANS\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Madam President, as I rise today to speak before my \ncolleagues in the 108th session of the US Congress, I have a sense of \ndeja vu. While I have only been a member of the Senate since 1997, I \nhave already seen the issues of prescription drugs for seniors and \nhealth care for the uninsured come and go--unresolved--a number of \ntimes. And while we continue to discuss the issues to death, people are \ndying.\n  According to a recent report by the Institute of Medicine, an \nestimated 18,000 people die every year because they don't have health \ninsurance, and don't get the care they need in a timely fashion. \nEighteen thousand deaths a year. And millions more people suffer \nunnecessarily due to delays in care, or lack of access to care. We need \nto do something substantial, and we need to do it now.\n  We have all heard the numbers, but they are so staggering that I have \nto mention them again. Today--right now as I speak--41 million \nAmericans are living, working, and going to school without health \ninsurance. That's one in every six Americans or 17 percent of our hard-\nworking citizens who do not have health insurance. They are our \nfriends, our neighbors, our children, our parents.\n  Many--more than 35 million of these uninsured Americans -are in low-\nincome working families. Many people who work in small businesses are \nnot offered health insurance, and those who are often cannot afford the \nskyrocketing premiums. My family owns a business, and I know what small \nbusinesses go through.\n  We want to provide health care to our hard working employees as much \nas they want us to offer it, but it is becoming so expensive and so \nbureaucratic, it grows more difficult every year. This Congress has its \nwork cut out--strengthening the economy, fighting a war, creating a \nprescription drug benefit for our Nation's seniors. These are just a \nfew of the important pieces of business before us this year. But the \nproblem of the uninsured will not go away--to the contrary, the ranks \nof the uninsured are growing by millions every year.\n  A crisis of this magnitude is going to require fundamental change, \neither through a series of incremental steps, such as helping lower \nincome Americans buy insurance or by spreading insurance risk, or by \nadopting a bold new approach, such as that advocated by Senator Breaux.\n  We in Congress should consider it a moral imperative to help everyone \nget access to affordable health coverage.\n  The number of uninsured people in America is an outrage, and every \nunnecessary death is a tragedy. If 18,000 Americans died in terrorist \nincidents each year, there would be widespread outrage.\n  Yet tens of thousands of uninsured Americans are at risk of dying \neach year from cancers diagnosed too late, or stroke from uncontrolled \nhigh blood pressure. These can be slow, painful deaths.\n  They are preventable deaths. We can help prevent these deaths. We \nshould help prevent these deaths. With the help of my colleagues, we \nwill help prevent these deaths by committing ourselves to substantial \nreform this congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/13/senate-section/article/S2450-2", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2450-S2451]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n           HISTORIC DEERFIELD CELEBRATES ITS 50TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, 2002 marked the 50th anniversary \nof the incorporation of Historic Deerfield. Founded in 1952 by Mr. and \nMrs. Henry Needham Flynt of Greenwich, Crt, the western Massachusetts \nmuseum complex is located within the 330-year-old village of Deerfield, \ncalled ``the gem of rural New England'' by the National Trust for \nHistoric Preservation. Cited often as the best documented small \ncommunity in America, Deerfield attracts scholars, curators, and \nstudents to study the history of New England using the village's rich \nmanuscript an research holdings. And, tourists and travelers from \nthroughout the world encounter the story of early America in the \nparlors and kitchens of Deer Field's old houses and along its mile-long \nthoroughfare simply called, ``The Street.''\n  Surrounded by more than 1,000 acres of actively farmed meadows, \nHistoric Deer Field's museum houses and decorative art galleries are \nfiled with more than 30,000 objects made or used in America between \n1650 and 1850. This carefully preserved community of 18th and 19th \ncentury houses and the renowned collections of antiques within them are \nframed by working farms in a quintessential New England village that \ntravelers are delighted to discover.\n  In 1936 Henry and Helen Flynt enrolled their son at Deerfield \nAcademy, a college preparatory school founded in 1797. The couple was \namazed at the remarkable but fragile state of preservation of the \nvillage's houses and buildings dating back to the early 18th century. \nMany were ghosts of their former selves, but still lived in by \ndescendants of the proud families that had survived the infamous \nDeerfield Massacre of 1704. In those years preceding World\n\n[[Page S2451]]\n\nWar II, Henry Flynt's great passion for America was stirred as he \nrealized that this little village, founded by English settlers in 1669 \nand whose meadows were inhabited by native peoples for thousands of \nyears before, had witnessed the great events of this country's history.\n  Encouraged by Deerfield Academy's legendary Headmaster Frank Learoyd \nBoyden, the Flynts began to purchase several of the old houses and \nrestore their ells and early additions as dormitory space for the \nschool's growing student body. Their interest in every American history \nand the decorative arts blossomed simultaneously and soon the Flynts \nwere restoring the old houses not as dormitories but as museums filled \nwith their growing collection of the finest antiques then available.\n  In 1945 the Flynts purchased the 1994 Deerfield Inn and restored it \nfor use by parents visiting Deerfield Academy students. In that same \nyear they bought an old house for themselves and furnished it as their \nDeerfield residence. By 1948 Historic Deerfield's first museum house--\nthe Parson Jonathan Ashley House--was opened to the public and in the \nensuing 25 years 13 more houses were furnished as museums welcoming \ngrowing numbers of visitors. Shortly before Henry Flynt's death in \n1970, a new research library was opened that also administers the \nextensive collection of early Deerfield manuscripts owned by the \nvillage historical society, The Pocumtuck Valley Memorial Association. \nFounded in 1880, this repository of local history and art still opens \nits doors to visitors each year from May to October.\n  In 1998 a long held dream was realized when a new, 27,000-square-foot \ndecorative arts museum--the Flynt Center of Early New England Life--was \nopened. With galleries for changing exhibitions, a unique storage \ndisplay of more than 3000 objects appropriately called the Museum's \nAttic, and expanded lecture and public program space, the Flynt Center \nwas the culmination of a $12 million capital campaign that attracted \ngifts from more than 800 individuals, foundations, and corporations \nthroughout America and abroad.\n  I congratulate Historic Deerfield on the occasion of its 50th \nanniversary, and I send my best wishes for 50 more great years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/13/senate-section/article/S2451-1", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2451]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         OREGON COMMUNITY HERO\n\n Mr. Smith. Madam President, as we celebrate Valentine's Day by \nsharing our love with those dear to our hearts, I find it fitting today \nto honor a man who has given his love, time, and dedication to all \nthose he serves. Mr. Dale Hilding of my home town of Pendleton, OR, is \nan exemplary civil servant, community volunteer, and family man. Both \nliterally and figuratively, he is a hero in every sense of the word.\n  Dale serves as the manager of the Pendleton Social Security office. \nAssisting the residents of eastern Oregon with such tasks as Social \nSecurity retirement, disability and supplemental income benefits; \nMedicare enrollment; and trouble shooting problems is a gargantuan \ntask. In each of these endeavors, Dale is superb.\n  Besides supervising employees and managing an office, Dale is also \nthe point of contact for congressional staff. Dale is at the head of \nthe class of Oregon congressional liaisons. He is efficient, effective, \nand positive in helping me serve my eastern Oregon constituents. Dale \nhas gone beyond the call of duty numerous times helping my staff answer \nSocial Security questions and solving problems for my constituents. He \nis a true civil servant hero.\n  Beyond his work as a Federal employee, Dale finds time to serve his \ncommunity. Taking the example of his father, also a civil servant, Dale \nsays: ``If you're an employee of the Federal Government, you have an \nobligation to be active in the community it serves.''\n  Dale took this advice to heart by spearheading the Combined Federal \nCampaign, CFC, in eastern Oregon. CFC is the annual fundraising drive \nconducted by Federal employees in their workplace. These dollars raised \nbenefit thousands of nonprofit charities.\n  Dale's performance was so phenomenal, in 2001 he was awarded with the \ncivilian CFC Hero Award. This national award is presented to only three \nwinners annually, representing the three areas of Federal service--\ncivilian, military, and postal. He is a true community hero.\n  Despite these activities, Dale still finds time to be an active \nfamily man to his wife and three children. In order to spend more time \nwith his kids, he decided to become involved in their favorite \nactivities. That led Dale to serve as an assistant scout master with \nthe Boy Scouts and an assistant troop leader with the Girl Scouts. Dale \nalso volunteers with the Umatilla County United Way. He is a true \nfamily hero.\n  Exemplary civil servant. Community volunteer. Family man. These are \njust a few of the many characteristics that make Dale Hilding an \nexceptional citizen of Oregon. It is with great respect that I, too, \ncall Dale ``hero.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/13/senate-section/article/S2451-2", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2451]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             FBLA-PBL WEEK\n\n Mr. BROWNBACK.

Madam President, this month, Iowa Wesleyan College \nis marking an important milestone--1 million hours of service by their \nstudents to the community. As we celebrate National Volunteer Month, I \nwould like to take a few moments to recognize this extraordinary \nachievement.\n  Iowa Wesleyan is a 161 year old liberal arts college located in Mount \nPleasant, IA. The college is affiliated with the Methodist Church and \n``Learning in Community'' has been the central mission since its \ninception in 1842. This mission was formally integrated in 1968 with \nthe establishment of the Responsible Social Involvement, RSI, program. \nInitially begun as a way to channel the strong desire of students to \nbecome socially active, RSI was adopted as a requirement for graduation \nin 1971.\n  Students must contribute a minimum of 160 hours of service to a non-\nprofit organization. They record their experiences in a journal, write \na paper reflecting on the experience and make an oral presentation to a \nfaculty committee. Students receive 6 hours of college credit for their \nservice.\n  For 35 years, Iowa Wesleyan students have served in all types of jobs \nand all kinds of communities. Students have served as mentors with Big \nBrother/Big Sister and volunteered for organizations including the \nAmerican Red Cross, Habitat for Humanity and Special Olympics. Students \nhave served in schools, orphanages and hospitals around the world. They \nhave contributed their time and talent in communities from Mount \nPleasant, IA to Jakarta, Indonesia.\n  Since 1968, Wesleyan students have provided companionship to nursing \nhome residents, tutored children on Indian reservations, coached \nathletic teams and the list goes on. Over the years, 5000 Wesleyan \nstudents have logged 1 million hours of service--or\n\n[[Page S2452]]\n\nmore than 114 years of service. The RSI program has been a life \nchanging experience for many and has prompted many alumni to continue \ntheir volunteer efforts after graduation. It is impossible to calculate \nthe total impact of the program around the State, Nation and world.\n  In the first of its kind survey of U.S. households, the National \nBureau of Labor Statistics reported that 59 million Americans over the \nage of 16 volunteered between September 2001 and September 2002. \nAlthough nearly 30 percent of our citizens are currently serving their \ncommunities, the need for more volunteers is vast and I encourage every \nperson to get involved. Volunteer work is the most rewarding experience \nyou will ever find.\n  I am reminded of this fact every week as a volunteer for the \nEverybody Wins! Program where I spend the lunch hour reading with a \nstudent at Brent Elementary. This is one of the most enjoyable parts of \nmy week and I wouldn't miss it for the world. Unfortunately, there are \ntoo many children and not enough volunteers, so please get involved.\n  You can check your local newspaper, contact nonprofit organizations \nin your areas or log on to the Internet to find out about volunteer \nopportunities in your community. There are millions of volunteer jobs \nthat need you. The best way to recognize this milestone of 1 million \nhours of service by the students of Iowa Wesleyan College is to join \nthem.\n  Congratulations to the students, alumni and staff of Iowa Wesleyan \nCollege for reaching this milestone. You have made a real difference to \nyour communities bullet.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/13/senate-section/article/S2452-1", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2452-S2453]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO DONALD FRIARY\n\n Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, Donald R. Friary, Executive \nDirector and Secretary at Historic Deerfield since 1975, who has been \non staff since 1965, will retire from his present position on December \n31, as the western Massachusetts museum concludes a year-long \ncelebration of its 50th anniversary. Friary, who announced his \nretirement in early 2001, has been named Director Emeritus and on \nJanuary 1, 2003 will begin work as Historic Deerfield's Senior Research \nFellow. In announcing Donald Friary's retirement, Henry N. Flynt, Jr., \nChairman of the museum's Board of Trustees and son of the museum's \nfounders said, ``Historic Deerfield is profoundly grateful for Don \nFriary's energy, imagination and strong leadership throughout his \nremarkable twenty-seven years as Executive Director. The successful \ncompletion of the campaign that made the Flynt Center of Early New \nEngland Life a reality, exemplifies his extraordinary skills as both a \nleader and a fundraiser. I reflect the Board's deep appreciation for \nDon's strong and steady hand through the years. We are particularly \npleased that he has agreed to accept an important new position at \nHistoric Deerfield upon his retirement as Executive Director, namely \nthat of Senior Research Fellow.''\n  Commenting on his plans to step down as Executive Director Friary \nsaid, ``Guiding and fostering the development of Historic Deerfield \nover these past twenty-seven years has been an extraordinary \nexperience. The ability of this institution to raise the funds \nnecessary to make possible the steady growth of the museum and library \ncollections, the expansion of programs, the increase in both the \nquality and number of staff, and one of the museum's crowning \nachievements to date--the creation of the Flynt Center of Early New \nEngland Life--has been deeply rewarding for me during my tenure as \nDirector. Deerfield has been home to me and to my family, it has shaped \nour lives and given much to us, as we have given much to it. Now, I \ngreatly anticipate doing what I have hoped to do since I first came \nhere as a graduate student nearly forty years ago--undertake the \nresearch that will allow me to write and lecture about the history of \nDeerfield and the Historic Deerfield collections. I look forward to \nkeeping in contact with our varied constituencies--our staff, our \nmembers and supporters, our Summer Fellows, and all who make this such \na unique and exciting place to live and work.''\n  Donald Friary is one of the longest serving directors of a major \nAmerican museum. He completed his twenty-seventh year at Historic \nDeerfield's helm and thirty-seventh year on staff when he stepped down \nas the museum's CEO at the end of 2002. He was a graduate student in \n1965 when he accepted the position of Head Tutor of the Historic \nDeerfield Summer Fellowship Program in Early American History and the \nDecorative Arts. A native of Boston, and a graduate of the Boston Latin \nSchool and Brown University, he holds a Ph.D. in American Civilization \nfrom the University of Pennsylvania. He served as the museum's \nfirst Director of Academic Programs from 1971 to 1973 and was named \nAssistant Director and then Executive Director in 1975.\n\n  Friary has been honored by election to the American Antiquarian \nSociety, the Colonial Society of Massachusetts, and the Massachusetts \nHistorical Society. He has served on the Boards of the Bay State \nHistorical League, the Dublin Seminar for New England Folklife, the \nMassachusetts Foundation for the Humanities, the Winterthur Museum's \nEducation Committee, and the Hill-Stead Museum. He was a Trustee and \nthen President of the Williamstown Art Conservation Center where an \nendowed conservation fellowship bears his name.\n  Over the last three decades, Friary has brought together a staff of \ncurators, conservators, and other highly skilled professionals in a \nvariety of fields to manage, market and interpret Deerfield's \nnationally renowned collections of decorative arts and the 18th and \n19th century houses in which they are displayed. Under his direction \nthe museum has developed a reputation for excellence in programming, \ninterpretation, and the preservation of the historic buildings and the \nopen space entrusted to its care. Friary was instrumental in forging an \nagreement of affiliation for teaching and research between Historic \nDeerfield and the Five College consortium in 1986 and has, himself, \ntaught several courses at Smith College through that affiliation. In \n1990 he was actively involved as a founder of the Deerfield Land Trust, \nwhich has, to date, saved more than 1600 acres of town farmland from \ndevelopment.\n  As Historic Deerfield's major fundraiser, Friary, with some Historic \nDeerfield Trustees and the museum's development office staff, raised \nthe more than $12 million needed to design, build and endow the Flynt \nCenter of Early New England Life, which opened in 1998. In 2000, on the \noccasion of his twenty-fifth anniversary as Executive Director, the \nCenter's major exhibition space was named the Donald R. Friary \nExhibition Gallery recognizing the role his leadership played in \nbringing this ambitious project to a successful conclusion.\n  Friary began the Friends of Historic Deerfield in 1976 and today 2000 \nmembers in 44 States and 7 foreign countries contribute a significant \namount to the museum's operating budget each year. When the Deerfield \nInn burned in 1979, Friary led the Board of Trustees in raising the \n$1.5 million necessary to repair, refurbish, and modernize the original \n19th century building, which remains today a centerpiece of the 333-\nyear-old village for the thousands of tourists and travelers who come \nto Deerfield each year from throughout the world.\n  Donald Friary's colleagues and students note that among his many \naccomplishments at Historic Deerfield has been his adherence to the \nhighest standards of excellence in the conservation and presentation of \nthe museum's nationally renowned collections for the benefit of all who \nvisit and study at Historic Deerfield each year. Friary summed up his \npersonal hope for the institution's future in the inaugural issue of \nthe museum's semi-annual magazine, published in Winter 2001, when he \nsaid, ``Historic Deerfield must and will maintain the standards of \nexcellence that inspired our founders Henry and Helen Flynt, that have \nguided our staff and Trustees, and that continue to assure our visitors \nthat at Historic Deerfield they have access to the story of New \nEngland's and America's past.''\n  Friary brought the endowment phase of the museum's capital campaign \nto a successful conclusion at the end of 2001 and has spent time in \n2002 traveling across the country celebrating Historic Deerfield's 50th \nanniversary with hundreds of constituents in several states.\n\n[[Page S2453]]\n\nIn the last several months he has overseen preparations to launch a new \ncampaign to fund a Children's Discovery Center, which is scheduled to \nopen in 2004. And, he is working on several collaborative initiatives \nas the town of Deerfield prepares to commemorate the tercentenary of \nits infamous 1704 French and Indian attack, which will take place \nduring 2004.\n  On the occasion of his well-deserved retirement, I salute Donald \nFriary for his dedication and outstanding service to Historic \nDeerfield, to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and to the \nnation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/13/senate-section/article/S2453-1", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2453]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    CONGRATULATING MISSOURI WINNERS FOR THE NATIONAL ENGINEERS WEEK \n                   REGIONAL FUTURE CITY COMPETITION.\n\n Mr. BOND.

Madam President, one of our great American \ncomposers, Lou Harrison, died recently at the age of 85. Mr. Harrison \nlived most of his life, including the last 50 years, in California. He \ntaught at a number of universities and had been honored in many ways in \nrecent years, including by a festival of his music at the San Francisco \nConservatory of Music. He was en route to another festival of his \nmusic, sponsored by Ohio State University and the Columbus Symphony \nOrchestra, when he died. The San Francisco Chronicle recently published \na thoughtful obituary written by its chief classical music critic, \nJoshua Kosman. I would like to print it in the Record in honor of this \ngreat man and his rich legacy.\n  The obituary follows:\n       Composer Lou Harrison, who delighted Bay Area audiences for \n     decades with his tuneful, spangly music as well as his \n     exuberantly generous personality, died of a heart attack \n     Sunday night in Lafayette, Ind. He was 85.\n       Mr. Harrison, a resident of Aptos (Santa Cruz County) since \n     1953, was on his way to Columbus, Ohio, for a weeklong \n     festival of his music sponsored by the Columbus Symphony \n     Orchestra and Ohio State University. According to Professor \n     Donald Harris, Mr. Harrison, who disliked flying, was being \n     transported in a university van from the Chicago train \n     station to Columbus on Sunday night. The van had stopped at a \n     roadside diner when he was stricken. He died at a local \n     hospital shortly afterward.\n       ``He was just such a great friend to music, to our planet \n     and to everybody,'' said San Francisco Symphony music \n     director Michael Tilson Thomas, an advocate who commissioned \n     an orchestral piece from Mr. Harrison to inaugurate his first \n     concert season in 1995. ``We're going to miss him greatly.''\n       ``This was an irreplaceable guy,'' said composer Charles \n     Amirkhanian, executive director of the Other Minds Festival, \n     which honored Mr. Harrison in 2000. ``The East Coast had \n     (Aaron) Copland, and we had Lou.''\n\n\n                      unabashedly beautiful music\n\n       Spirited, rhythmically vibrant and unabashedly beautiful, \n     Mr. Harrison's music incorporated elements of Asian and \n     Western styles in a highly personal synthesis. He had a \n     fondness for the jangly, percussive sounds of Asian music, \n     and in addition to traditional instruments, his scores often \n     included such devices as flowerpots, porcelain rice bowls, \n     garbage cans and oxygen tanks.\n       Many of these instruments were built in collaboration with \n     his life partner William Colvig, who died in 2000. Together, \n     the two men created a large orchestra of idiosyncratic metal \n     percussion instruments for which Mr. Harrison wrote dozens of \n     pieces.\n       He wrote copiously in traditional Western forms as well, \n     including symphonies, operas, chamber and choral music.\n       What united all his music, though, was its essentially \n     melodic nature. Whether shaped by medieval French dance \n     rhythms, Javanese modes or Korean harmonies, melody always \n     was Mr. Harrison's primary building block.\n       ``These are melodies that stick with you and are useful for \n     everyday life,'' Thomas said. ``There are tunes by Lou \n     Harrison that are ideal for walking up a steep ridge, and \n     some that are good for falling asleep in a hammock. He had \n     the gift for finding the tune that had the essence of a \n     particular experience.''\n       And in the face of orthodoxies favoring structural \n     integrity and fearless dissonance, Mr. Harrison was never \n     afraid to write music that celebrated beauty for its own \n     sake.\n       ``He was one of the very first composers to bring back the \n     pleasure principle,'' said composer John Adams. ``For those \n     of us who came of age during the bad old days when rigor and \n     theory and the atomization of musical elements was so in \n     vogue, Lou provided a model of expressivity and sheer \n     beauty.''\n       Mr. Harrison also was the last living link to a tradition \n     of American experimental music that reached back to Charles \n     Ives--whose Third Symphony had its premiere in 1946 with Mr. \n     Harrison conducting--and included such influential figures as \n     Henry Cowell, Harry Partch and John Cage.\n       Lou Silver Harrison was born on May 14, 1917, in Portland, \n     Ore., and moved frequently as a child throughout the Pacific \n     Northwest and the Bay Area. By the time he graduated from \n     Burlingame High School in 1934, he said, he had attended 18 \n     different schools, ``so I never really put down roots or had \n     a peer group.''\n       He studied music briefly at San Francisco State University, \n     then began private lessons with Cowell, who encouraged his \n     interest in world music and nontraditional instrumental \n     techniques. Cowell also introduced him to Cage, who would be \n     a lifelong friend and artistic collaborator.\n       After a brief stint at UCLA, where he enrolled in Arnold \n     Schoenberg's composition seminar, Mr. Harrison moved to New \n     York in 1943. There he wrote music criticism for the New York \n     Herald Tribune under the aegis of Virgil Thomson and edited \n     and premiered Ives' Third Symphony, which won the composer a \n     Pulitzer Prize.\n       But Mr. Harrison found New York life too stressful, and \n     after a two-year teaching engagement at Black Mountain \n     College in North Carolina, he settled in Aptos for good in \n     1953. In subsequent years, he taught at Stanford University, \n     San Jose State University, Cabrillo College and Mills \n     College. In 1963, he was one of the founders of the Cabrillo \n     Music Festival, which continues as an annual celebration of \n     new music.\n       His nearest survivors are his sister-in-law, Dorothy \n     Harrison, and two nephews. His body was cremated, but other \n     arrangements are incomplete.\n       In recent years, Mr. Harrison's music was a frequent \n     feature of San Francisco Symphony programs, with the composer \n     himself, in his trademark red flannel shirt and snow-white \n     beard, beaming from a loge box. In addition to ``A Parade for \n     M.T.T.,'' premiered in 1995, the Symphony has performed the \n     Third Symphony, the Canticle No. 3 and the Organ Concerto.\n       His music is amply represented on the San Francisco record \n     label New Albion.\n       In 1998, Barry Jekowsky and the California Symphony \n     released a disc of his music, including the Fourth Symphony \n     with jazz vocalist Al Jarreau as narrator.\n       Mr. Harrison's interests extended far beyond music. He was \n     a published poet and a painter, and as a young man had been a \n     dancer as well--a fact he enjoyed relating to audiences in \n     his later years, when his girth made the idea seem \n     incongruous.\n\n\n                        committed to gay rights\n\n       He was committed to gay rights long before the subject was \n     common; his 1971 puppet opera ``Young Caesar'' focused on a \n     gay love affair of Julius Caesar's. He was an ardent pacifist \n     and political activist.\n       And he had more exotic passions as well--Esperanto, bio-\n     diesel, kenaf (a fiber related to the hibiscus that he touted \n     as an ecologically sound alternative to paper), calligraphy, \n     American Sign Language and especially straw-bale \n     construction. His straw-bale house in the Mojave Desert near \n     Joshua Tree National Park, completed last year, was a joyful \n     retreat in his final months.\n       That spirit of all-embracing receptivity and openness to \n     experience was evident everywhere in his music. As he once \n     told an interviewer, ``There are so many musics that I'm \n     attracted to. I'm fortunate that I laid out my toys on a very \n     large acreage when I was very young.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/13/senate-section/article/S2453-3", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2453-S2454]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  REPORT CONCERNING THE JUSTIFICATION OF THE AUSTRALIA GROUP AND THE \n     CONVENTION ON THE PROHIBITION OF THE DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION, \nSTOCKPILING AND USE OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS AND ON THEIR DESTRUCTION--PM 16\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United\n\n[[Page S2454]]\n\nStates, together with an accompanying report; which was referred to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Consistent with the resolution of advice and consent to ratification \nof the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, \nStockpiling, and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction, \nadopted by the United States Senate on April 24, 1997, I hereby certify \npursuant to Condition 7(C)(i), Effectiveness of the Australia Group, \nthat:\n  Australia Group members continue to maintain equally effective or \nmore comprehensive controls over the export of: toxic chemicals and \ntheir precursors; dual-use processing equipment; human, animal, and \nplant pathogens and toxins with potential biological weapons \napplications; and dual-use biological equipment, as that afforded by \nthe Australia Group as of April 25, 1997; and\n  The Australia Group remains a viable mechanism for limiting the \nspread of chemical and biological weapons-related materials and \ntechnology, and the effectiveness of the Australia Group has not been \nundermined by changes in membership, lack of compliance with common \nexport controls and nonproliferation measures, or the weakening of \ncommon controls and nonproliferation measures, in force as of April 25, \n1997.\n  The factors underlying this certification are described in the \nenclosed statement of justification.\n                                                      George W.

Cole in Yemen; American \n     embassies in East Africa; the Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia; \n     the World Trade Center in New York; the Pentagon in \n     Washington, D.C.; and\n       Whereas, in the past, present and future, thousands of men \n     and women in the Armed Forces of the United States, including \n     many from the Traverse City area, have been and continue to \n     be engaged in defending against terrorist attacks worldwide; \n     and\n       Whereas, these men and women have taken an oath to defend \n     the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, \n     foreign and domestic; and\n       Whereas, these men and women have demonstrated their \n     dedication to defining our freedoms with their personal \n     sacrifices, in some cases the ultimate sacrifice of their \n     lives, in order for us to enjoy the freedoms so often taken \n     for granted; and\n       Whereas, especially in this holiday season, these men and \n     women serve in faraway and lonely places, separated from \n     homes and families, without the comforts and joys of this \n     season of peace; and\n       Whereas, through this resolution, the City Commission will \n     be extending due respect to all our men and women in the \n     Armed Forces of the United States and a greater sense of \n     national gratitude to those who are preserving our liberties: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the City Commission of the City of Traverse \n     City expresses its support and appreciation to the men and \n     women of the Armed Forces of the United States in the War on \n     Terrorism in this holiday season; and further, be it\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the Office of the President of the United States, the \n     President of the United States Senate, and the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-50. A resolution adopted by the House of the \n     Legislature of the State of Michigan relative to expanding \n     Medicare to include a prescription pharmaceutical plan for \n     low-income seniors; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 597\n\n       Whereas, As the costs of medicine rise and as more seniors \n     face great difficulties in paying for prescription \n     medications, there is a genuine need to expand the coverages \n     provided under Medicare. For an increasing number of our \n     older citizens, the choice between spending limited financial \n     resources on food or medicine creates a strain that can in \n     itself be damaging to a person's health and well-being; and\n       Whereas, Beyond the financial considerations of proposals \n     to offer a prescription drug plan under Medicare, \n     implementing a program will elevate the level of health care \n     for many people. Clearly, this will benefit not only the \n     seniors who participate, but their families as well; and\n       Whereas, It is significant to note that, even as our \n     country faces the expensive task of fighting terrorism and \n     even as we battle recession, the issue of low-income seniors \n     needing prescription drug coverage remains critical. For \n     those who face the painful realities of being unable to pay \n     for vitally needed medication, this is a crisis of its own: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to expand \n     Medicare to include a prescription pharmaceutical plan for \n     low-income seniors; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-51. A resolution adopted by the House of the \n     Legislature of the State of Michigan relative to allow \n     taxpayers to deduct fully the cost of their health insurance \n     premiums; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 601\n\n       Whereas, A key factor in a person's overall quality of life \n     is access to health care. Having health insurance contributes \n     to better health for individuals and families. On a larger \n     scale, people with health insurance benefit society because \n     they are far less likely to need public resources when health \n     problems arise; and\n       Whereas, Through our state and federal tax policies, our \n     nation has made decisions on what types of behavior benefit \n     our society. There are many examples of this. Our tax laws \n     encourage people to save for retirement, invest in business \n     enterprises, make donations for charitable purposes, and own \n     homes. A great number of specific expenses are deductible, \n     although some require different thresholds to qualify; and\n       Whereas, Given the clear public benefits to our society \n     that derive from those who purchase health insurance, it \n     would be a sound public policy to take every step to \n     encourage the purchase of health insurance. It seems not only \n     eminently fair, but also in the best interests of the country \n     to amend federal tax laws to provide that an individual's \n     premium costs for health insurance are fully deductible. By \n     taking this step to encourage people to secure insurance, we \n     will be addressing a fundamental need, reducing some public \n     costs, and helping our citizens help themselves and their \n     families: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize Congress to enact legislation to provide that \n     taxpayers can deduct fully the cost of their health insurance \n     premiums; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-52. A resolution adopted by the House of the \n     Legislature of the State of Michigan relative to removing \n     ``use it or lose it'' restrictions on flexible spending \n     accounts to permit participants to roll over unused funds to \n     the next year, to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 602\n\n       Whereas, Flexible spending accounts have proven to be \n     effective tools for helping people cope with necessary \n     expenses, such as dependent care and medical costs. Like many \n     aspects of tax policies that encourage behavior that \n     ultimately benefits both individuals and our entire society, \n     flexible spending accounts reflect sensitivity to the \n     challenges people face in providing for themselves and their \n     families; and\n       Whereas, Under the current provisions of the laws governing \n     taxes, flexible spending accounts are subject to tight \n     restrictions. While most of the provisions are very \n     productive in ensuring fairness, one of the policies in place \n     is proving to be counterproductive. Currently, a participant \n     with a flexible spending account must use all the money in \n     the account by the end of each year or forfeit the remaining \n     funds. This is a serious disincentive to participation. This \n     requirement not only presumes a person can predict exactly \n     how much money will be spent on the covered activity in a \n     year, but it also ignores the fact that the money set aside \n     for the intended purposes still belongs to the participant; \n     and\n       Whereas, It would be far more appropriate to permit a \n     participant to transfer unused funds in a flexible spending \n     account to the next year rather than losing the unused money: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to enact \n     legislation to remove the ``use it or lose it'' restrictions \n     on flexible spending accounts to permit participants to roll \n     over unused funds to the next year; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-53. A resolution adopted by the House of the \n     Legislature of the State of Michigan relative to providing \n     more flexibility for participants in medical care spending \n     accounts; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 603\n\n       Whereas, Medical care spending accounts are an effective \n     tool for people to use to prepare for medical expenses and \n     minimize overall costs. These flexible spending accounts help \n     individuals and families dealing with the increasing costs of \n     health care; and\n       Whereas, All measures that encourage people to plan for \n     medical expenses also bring benefits through the increased \n     number of people seeking and paying for medical services \n     without relying on governmental programs. For participants, \n     medical care spending accounts can bring significant savings, \n     especially since major health care expenses are often \n     unforeseen; and\n       Whereas, While medical care spending accounts have been \n     helpful to many American families, there is much more that \n     could be done to increase the rate of participation. The \n     nature of medical expenses argues strongly for increased \n     flexibility to meet unforeseen health costs. With the ever-\n     increasing cost of medical services, every effort should be \n     made to increase participation in medical care spending \n     accounts by removing the barriers and restrictions that keep \n     many people from taking advantage of this idea Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to enact \n     legislation to provide more flexibility for participants in \n     medical care spending accounts; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-54.

A resolution adopted by the City of Ann Arbor, \n     Michigan relative to opposition to war in Iraq; to the \n     Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n                               Resolution\n\n       Whereas, A United States war against Iraq could have \n     significant impact on the Citizens of Ann Arbor, in terms of \n     the potential loss of life and disability among our members \n     of the armed forces, as well as an economic impact as our \n     local tax dollars are diverted to the costs of war, not \n     returned to our State and our community to be spent on needed \n     social, health and education services;\n       Whereas, The United States has declared this decade, 2000-\n     2010 as the ``International Decade for a Culture of Peace and \n     Non-Violence for the Children of the World'' (UN Declaration \n     53/25, November 10, 1998), urging all people and all levels \n     of government to seek non-violent approaches to conflict \n     resolution and wider education about international law and \n     alternative to war;\n       Whereas, A unilateral preemptive war would be a radical \n     change in the principles of international law and custom that \n     the United States has always followed;\n       Whereas, All war brings destruction and loss of lives, both \n     of combatants and civilians, to all involved countries;\n       Whereas, Our U.S. Congressional Delegation, Senators Carl \n     Levin and Debbie Stabenow and House Representatives Lynn \n     Rivers and John Dingell, voted against unilateral war by the \n     United States against Iraq and have urged the United States \n     to cooperate with the United Nations in any decision on \n     military action against Iraq, and would be encouraged by our \n     support; and\n       Whereas, The Ann Arbor City Council cannot speak for all \n     residents, but has been asked by many residents to speak out \n     on this momentous issue facing our nation; therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Ann Arbor City Council joins with the \n     communities of Washington, D.C.; Seattle, Washington; \n     Albuquerque, New Mexico; Takoma Park, Maryland; Arcata, \n     California, Santa Barbara, California, Santa Cruz, \n     California; Ithaca, New York; Santa Fee, New Mexico; Danby, \n     New York; Sebastopol, California; New Haven, Connecticut; \n     Oakland, California; Carrboro, North Carolina; Haines \n     Township, Pennsylvania; Madison, Wisconsin; Burlington, \n     Vermont; and Detroit, Michigan; and with our U.S. \n     Congressional Delegation, Senators Carl Levin and Debbie \n     Stabenow and Representatives Lynn Rivers and John Dingell, in \n     opposing a war with the country of Iraq, particularly prior \n     to taking all available measures to cooperate with the United \n     Nations in removing all weapons of mass destruction.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-56. A resolution adopted by the City of Palm Bay, \n     Florida relative to completely banning human cloning; to the \n     Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                         Resolution No. 2003-06\n\n       Whereas, human cloning is a manufacturing process in which \n     a human being is created in a laboratory; human cloning \n     indicates a utilitarian view in which a human being is \n     created merely for usefulness with no respect for the dignity \n     of that human being; and human cloning creates a human being \n     who is the twin of a parent, has no other biological parent, \n     and is the child of the grandparents thereby causing serious \n     moral, social, and legal issues, and\n       Whereas, current human cloning attempts pose a substantial \n     risk of producing human beings with unpredictable but \n     potentially devastating health problems, and\n       Whereas, such human cloning attempts are grossly \n     irresponsible and unethical, and\n       Whereas, on July 31, 2001, the United States House of \n     Representatives passed the Human Cloning Prohibition Act of \n     2001, a complete human cloning ban; and the President of the \n     United States has called for a complete human cloning ban; \n     and\n       Whereas, the United States Senate failed to act on the bill \n     passed by the United States House of Representatives before \n     the end of the 107th Congress, and\n       Whereas, a complete human cloning ban is achieved by the \n     passage of the Human Cloning Prohibition Act of 2003 as \n     introduced in the United States House of Representatives by \n     Congressman Dave Weldon, M.D. (H.R. 234) and is not achieved \n     by the passage of other human cloning prohibition acts that \n     allow the creation of human embryos by cloning so long as \n     they are killed for research: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the City Council of the City of Palm Bay, \n     Brevard County, Florida, as follows:\n       Section 1. The above recitals are true and correct and by \n     this reference are hereby incorporated into and made an \n     integral part of this resolution.\n       Section 2.

A bill to amend the Clean Air Act to eliminate methyl \ntertiary butyl ether from the United States fuel supply, to increase \nproduction and use of renewable fuel, and to increase the Nation's \nenergy independence, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironmental and Public Works.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, headlines in daily papers all across \nthe country underscore our economy's vulnerability to foreign oil.\n  Today, a new generation is learning what many Americans have known \nsince the 1970s--our economic security and our national security depend \non our energy security.\n  Today I, along with a number of my colleagues, am introducing the \nFuels Security Act of 2003.\n  This bill responds directly to our Nation's unhealthy reliance on \nimported oil by establishing greater flexibility in our gasoline \nregulations, and by tripling the use of domestic, renewable fuels over \nthe next 10 years.\n  This legislation is identical to the fuels agreement included in last \nyear's Senate-passed energy bill.\n  Based on the experience we have gained over the last seven years with \nthe reformulated gasoline program, the Fuel Security Act bill makes a \nnumber of important changes in Federal law.\n  It bans MTBE in 4 years, authorizes funding to cleanup MTBE \ncontamination and fix leaking underground tanks, allows the most \npolluted states to opt into the reformulated gasoline program, and \nprovides all States with additional authority under the Clean Air Act \nto address air quality concerns.\n  It eliminates the oxygen requirement from the RFG program, a change \nthat is very important to states that are planning to remove MTBE from \ntheir gasoline supplies in the near future.\n  To preserve the hard-fought air quality gains that have resulted from \nthe implementation of that requirement, the bill creates a renewable \nfuels standard that will nearly triple the use of renewable fuels like \nethanol and biodiesel over the next 10 years.\n  Finally, the bill also provides special encouragement to biomass-\nbased ethanol, which holds great promise for converting a variety of \norganic materials into useful fuel, while substantially reducing \ngreenhouse gas emissions.\n  Ethanol comes from American farmers and producers, passes through \nAmerican refiners, and fuels American energy needs. No soldier has to \nfight overseas to protect it. And no international cartel could turn \noff the spigot.\n  For years, we talked about those benefits with a sense of \nresignation. After all, these aren't new arguments, and yet there were \na lot of people who still saw ethanol as a boutique fuel, not a real \nanswer to our energy problems.\n  With this legislation, we intend to change that preception--and get \nAmerica moving toward energy independence.\n  The renewable fuels standard will be a win-win-win. It will help the \nenvironment, it will help the rural economies which are hurting right \nnow, and it will help reduce America's dangerous dependence on foreign \noil.\n  I believe we can make it law. During consideration of the Energy Bill \nlast summer, the Senate endorsed the Renewable Fuels Standard package \nby a vote of 69 to 30.\n  Overall, this legislation is a careful balance of often disparate and \ncompeting interests--and a compromise in the finest tradition of the \nU.S. Senate.\n  Just look at some of the organizations whose active support is \nhelping to make this legislation possible: The Northeast States \nCoordinated Air Use Management Agency, the American Petroleum \nInstitute, the Clean Fuels Development Coalition, the American Lung \nAssociation, the American Coalition for Ethanol, the Renewable Fuels \nAssociation, the Governor's Ethanol Coalition, the National Farmers \nUnion, the American Farm Bureau, the National Corn Growers Association, \nand the American Corn Growers Association.\n\n[[Page S2459]]\n\n  That support across the political and ideological spectrum is \nreflected within the Senate as well.\n  I particularly want to thank Senator Lugar. The seeds for this \ncomprehensive legislation were planted a few years ago when he and I \nfirst introduced legislation to establish a renewable fuels standard \nand provide flexibility in producing reformulated gasoline. Senator \nLugar's enthusiastic support gave this idea needed momentum and helped \nlay the groundwork for agreement on this legislation last year.\n  In addition, Senators Tim Johnson and Chuck Hagel deserve enormous \ncredit for legislation they introduced last year to establish a very \nambitious renewable fuels standard, and for their work in promoting \nthis concept.\n  And there are many others--Senators Ben Nelson, Tom Harkin, Chuck \nGrassley, Byron Dorgan, Mark Dayton, Dick Durbin, Max Baucus, Kit Bond, \nGeorge Voinovich, and others--who all deserve recognition for the \nprogress we have made on this issue.\n  Look at America's energy situation today: gasoline prices are high, \nfarm income is low and America is importing close to 60 percent of the \noil we use.\n  At the same time, our substantial appetite for energy continues to \ngrow every year. Over the next ten years, the United States is expected \nto consume roughly 1.5 trillion gallons of gasoline. At the same time, \nwe hold only three percent of the known world oil reserves.\n  It has been said that ``we are all continually faced with a series of \ngreat opportunities, brilliantly disguised as insolvable problems.''\n  Meeting our energy challenges is a difficult problem, but it is also \na great opportunity to demonstrate American strength, and American \ningenuity.\n  By increasing the use of renewable fuels, preserving clean air gains \nand moving us toward energy independence, that is what I believe this \nbill does.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, I am pleased to join with my colleague, \nSenator Daschle, in reintroducing the Renewable Fuels Act. I am \nthankful for this opportunity to remind my colleagues about the \nimportance of this legislation, and the benefits it brings to the \nAmerican people.\n  In the 107th Congress, the Senate voted in favor of a comprehensive \nenergy bill establishing a renewable fuels standard. This provision \nwould triple the amount of renewable fuel America consumes, displacing \nnearly 600,000 barrels of oil per day. The bipartisan renewable fuels \nagreement is a culmination of years of effort and enjoys strong support \nfrom a broad spectrum. Regrettably, disagreements on other provisions \nin the comprehensive energy legislation stranded the renewable fuels \nprovision in a House-Senate conference committee last year.\n  Senator Daschle and I first introduced a bill creating a renewable \nfuels standard three years ago. Like that earlier bill, this bill \nrepresents an important first step toward reducing our dependence on \nforeign oil and improving our nation's energy security. At the same \ntime, this proposal goes far toward protecting the environment, \nstimulating rural economic development, and increasing the flexibility \nof the national fuel supply to reduce the impact of future price \nspikes.\n  This bill will also forms the basis for a solution to the MTBE \nproblem that will be acceptable to all regions of the nation. MTBE, a \ncarcinogen that contaminates drinking water, is on its way out. This \nproposal addresses public concerns regarding water pollution while \nconsidering all of the environmental and energy security issues \ninvolved. It requires the EPA Administrator to end the use of MTBE \nwithin four years in order to protect public health and the \nenvironment. And it establishes strict ``anti-backsliding'' provisions \nto capture all of the air quality benefits of MTBE and ethanol as MTBE \nis phased down and then phased out.\n  Those of us who recall the energy crises of the 1970s--and recognize \nthe current political instability in oil-rich regions around the \nworld--remain committed to the development of cheap, plentiful \nrenewable sources of energy. For years, tax incentives supporting \nethanol production have helped foster the creation of a strong domestic \nethanol industry. But more needs to be done to reduce the cost of \nethanol and make this plant-based commodity more competitive with \nfossil fuels.\n  Energy and agriculture are closely tied topics that have been of \ninterest to me for several years. Since 1996, I have chaired five \nhearings in the Agriculture Committee regarding energy security and \nrenewable fuels. These hearings were designed to inform the public that \nour reliance on imported oil is growing, making the U.S. and the world \nincreasingly dependent on the unstable nations of the Persian Gulf and \nthe Caspian Sea. At the same time, the hearings convinced many in \nWashington that a greater reliance on renewable fuels like ethanol \ncould have major energy security, air quality and rural development \nbenefits.\n  As we look to the future, major new scientific and technical \nbreakthroughs are making ethanol more economical. As a result of the \nBiomass Research and Development Act, federal agencies are now \ncoordinating research activities focused on making ethanol out of \nvirtually any plant in the world. New biocatalysts--genetically \nengineered enzymes, yeasts, and bacteria--are reducing the cost of so-\ncalled cellulosic ethanol to the point where petroleum products may one \nday face vigorous competition.\n  The legislation we are introducing today will build on these efforts \nby offering an incentive to producers of cellulosic ethanol. Like our \nprevious proposals, this bill gives a special credit to users of \ncellulosic ethanol for the purpose of fulfilling requirements of the \nrenewable fuels standard.\n  This legislation will go far toward strengthening our national \nsecurity, improving our rural communities, protecting our natural \nenvironment and, ultimately, substituting carbohydrates for \nhydrocarbons.\n  Thank you for joining me in supporting ethanol, a domestic form of \nclean, renewable energy.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Madam President, I come to the floor this morning to speak \nbriefly about an important, comprehensive fuels bill that I will \nintroduce today, along with Senators Daschle, Lugar, Johnson, \nVoinovich, Grassley, and others. This bill aims to enhance air and \nwater quality, reduce supply and distribution challengers in the \ngasoline market, and increase energy security by expanding the use of \nclean, domestically produced renewable fuels.\n  Specifically, our bill follows the advice of the EPA's Blue Ribbon \nPanel on Oxygenates by repealing the Federal oxygenate mandate and \nphasing out the use of MTBE nationwide. It also contains a reasonable \nRenewable Fuel Standard, RFS, which would gradually increase the \nnation's use of renewable fuel to 5 billion gallons a year by 2012. All \nof this while protecting the environmental gains already made by the \nreformulated gasoline program.\n  This legislation mirrors the bipartisan fuels agreement in last \nyear's Senate energy bill, which gained the votes of 69 Senators. This \nyear, we have worked to build an even broader, bipartisan coalition of \ncosponsors.\n  Much has happened since the Senate passed its energy bill last year. \nThe renewable fuels industry has expanded considerably to meet growing \ndemand. The ethanol industry opened 12 new plants last year, with 10 \nadditional plants now under construction. Sixteen of these new plants \nare farmer-owned co-operatives. By the end of 2003, annual ethanol \nproduction capacity is expected to exceed 3 billion gallons. In \nDecember the ethanol industry wrapped up a record year--2.13 billion \ngallons in 2002, up by more than 20 percent over 2001.\n  Also, ChevronTexaco announced last month that it will switch from \nblending MTBE to blending ethanol in the southern California market--\nmaking Chevron the last of the large California refiners to make the \nswitch to ethanol. This means that more than 80 percent of California's \nfederally-reformulated gasoline will be blended with ethanol by May \n2003.\n  We should not forget that biodiesel, made primarily from soybeans and \nstill a developing fuel technology, has grown enough that it is now \nused in more than 200 State and Federal automobile fleets--using a 20-\npercent blend or higher.\n  Today, 16 States have already banned MTBE. With State MTBE bans will \ncome increased challenges to fuel distribution and supply. The national \nphase-down of MTBE proposed in this bill will help us meet these \nchallenges.\n\n[[Page S2460]]\n\nAnd a national Renewable Fuels Standard with a credit and trading \nprogram will ensure that renewable fuels are used where they make the \nmost sense. In fact, according to a recent analysis, enacting this \nfuels bill would even reduce refiner costs, .2 cents, per gallon \ncompared to current law.\n  The Standard in our legislation is a fair and workable compromise new \ncrafted nearly a year ago--after months of work the American Petroleum \nInstitute, the environmental community, the Northeast air directors, \nagricultural groups, DOE, EPA and others. Senator Daschle and I helped \nfacilitate those talks. We crafted the language of last year's fuels \nagreement--the same language in this bill.\n  This is not a per-gallon mandate. It will not force a specific level \nof compliance in places where compliance may be difficult.\n  Our Nation needs a broader, deeper and more diverse energy portfolio. \nToday, less than one percent of America's transportation fuel comes \nfrom renewable sources. Under this energy bill, renewable fuel use \nwould increase to approximately 3 percent of our total transportation \nfuel supply--tripling the amount of renewable fuel we now use.\n  Today, America imports nearly sixty percent of the crude oil it \nconsumes. This amount is estimated to climb to 70 percent by 2002. \nAlmost a fourth of America's oil imports come from the Persian Gulf. \nLast year, the United States imported nearly half-a-million barrels of \noil a day from Iraq. Overall, petroleum imports cost the United States \nmore than $100 billion a year--around 25 percent of our trade deficit.\n  This country consumers more than 300 billion gallons of crude oil a \nyear--of that, 165 billion gallons is refined into gasoline and diesel. \nOur legislation says that by 2012, not less then 5 billion gallons of \nthat 165 billion gallons shall come from renewable sources. By enacting \nthis legislation, we would replace 66 billion gallons of foreign crude \noil by 2012; reduce foreign oil purchases by $34 billion; create more \nthan 200,000 jobs nationwide; and boost U.S. farm income by more than \n$6 billion a year.\n  As the new Congress prepares to resume deliberations on a new \nnational energy plan, I ask my colleagues to seriously consider this \nlegislation--which will assist our efforts to modernize the Nation's \ntransportation fuel system and address the environmental, energy and \nsecurity concerns for today and tomorrow.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I am pleased to join my colleagues, \nSenator Daschle, as well as Senator Lugar, Senator Hagel, Senator \nJohnson and others in introducing this bipartisan piece of legislation \ntoday.\n  This bill is extremely important--from an environmental perspective \nand from an energy security perspective.\n  This bill increase the use of ethanol as an additive in gasoline. \nThat means that we will be increasing the use of renewable sources in \nthe fuel that we pump into our gas tanks. Transportation is the sector \nthat uses the greatest amount of imported oil. By replacing some of the \npetroleum products in gasoline, we will help reduce our dependence on \nforeign oil. The White House recognizes that: ``America imports 55 \npercent of the oil it consumes; that is expected to grow to 68 percent \nby 2025. Nearly all of our cars and trucks run on gasoline, and they \nare the main reason America imports so much oil. Two-thirds of the 20 \nmillion barrels of oil Americans use each day is used for \ntransportation.''\n  Let me point out the top countries from whom we import crude oil: our \ntop supplier is Saudi Arabia. Almost one-third of our oil comes from \nthe Middle East--and Iraq is our fifth largest supplier. Venezuela is \nour fourth largest supplier. Their country has been rocked by crisis \nfor the last couple of years. So, it is in our best interest to reduce \nthe amount of oil we import from these nations.\n  This bill is also important because it will phase-out MTBE \nnationally. MTBE has been shown to contaminate water supplies and to \nhave the ability to cause potentially harmful side effects. This is \nimportant. We have attempted to do this here in Congress for several \nyears. We should not be exposing ourselves and our children to such \nharmful contaminants. Now is the time to act to remove this from our \ngasoline and from our water supplies. No more delays. I urge may \ncolleagues to work with me to move this important legislation in a \ntimely manner.\n  Today, ethanol reduces the demand for oil and MTBE imports by 98,000 \nbarrels per day. To me, this just makes good sense: take starch from \ncorn or wheat, break it down into simple sugars, then ferment it to \nproduce ethanol that can be used for energy. The byproducts can be \nused, too.\n\n\n                 renewable fuels provision in the bill\n\n  The renewable fuels provision has been carefully negotiated over a \nperiod of months and years. Now, 20 groups, including the Nation Corn \nGrowers Association, Renewable Fuels Association, American Farm Bureau \nFederation, and the National Farmers Union, have sent a letter \nexpressing their support for this legislation. 1.8 billion gallons of \npure ethanol are currently produced each year. This provision would add \n3.2 billion new gallons over a period of years for a total of 5 billion \ngallons by 2012. And, this provision will ensure that the ethanol \nindustry continues to grow.\n  This translates to a new market for 1.19 billion bushels of corn and \nother agricultural products. This also means new opportunities for \nfarmers to invest in value-added processing of a product they're \nalready growing. While we are seeing mergers and acquisitions in the \npetroleum and other industries, the ethanol industry is diversifying, \nas farmers invest in local processing.\n\n\n                              north dakota\n\n  I am excited about the wide range of opportunities ethanol presents. \nOne unique opportunity is being created in my home state of North \nDakota. The aerospace program at the University of North Dakota and the \nEnvironment and Energy Research Center (EERC) are researching the \npotential for using ethanol as aviation fuel.\n  Aviation fuel is the last fuel in the U.S. that still contains lead. \nUND is now teaming up with South Dakota State University and the \nFederal Aviation Administration on a program to get ethanol approved \nand certified to help replace this lead-based aviation fuel.\n  And we are working on building E85 (blended ethanol fuel) stations in \nNorth Dakota.\n\n\n                           economic benefits\n\n  According to some estimates, the ethanol industry is responsible for \nmore than 40,000 direct and indirect jobs, creating more than $1.3 \nbillion in increased household income annually, and more than $12.6 \nbillion over the next five years.\n  During the past year, industry has built 12 new facilities. Ten new \nfacilities are under construction, and dozens more are in the planning \nstages. The ethanol industry adds--directly and indirectly--more than \nthan $6 billion to our economy each year.\n  I am excited by the opportunities this sector presents for my State, \nthe region, and the entire Nation.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, I am pleased that we are reintroducing \nrenewable fuels legislation and that we are taking time today to talk \nabout the benefits and importance of this bill.\n  I want to acknowledge the extraordinary leadership of Senator Daschle \nand also Senator Byron Dorgan of North Dakota who was on the floor to \nspeak to this issue but was called away for another critical \nresponsibility and will not be able to be in the Chamber this morning.\n  There has been a great deal of discussion about the nation's energy \nsituation. The increasing volatility in gasoline and diesel prices, the \ngrowing tension in the world from the terrorist attacks, and the \npossibility of war with Iraq have affected all of us. The more we \ndepend on oil from the Middle East, the more our stability is \ninextricably tied to governments and factions in that region. There is \na critical need for finding new sources of energy that will move the \ncountry away from dependence of a natural resource available in \nincreasingly volatile regions of the world. Dependence on foreign oil \nin the unstable Middle East and South America makes us less stable. The \nuse of domestic, clean, renewable energy sources can increase our \nenergy security and increase the nation's security. It must be a \ncritical part of our nation's energy strategy.\n  To this end, last year I introduced a bill with Sen. Chuck Hagel of \nNebraska that would ensure future\n\n[[Page S2461]]\n\ngrowth for ethanol and biodiesel. The bill would create a new, \nrenewable fuels content standard in all motor fuel produced and used in \nthe United States. Last year, the Senate passed a comprehensive energy \nbill which included the framework of our legislation. Today, ethanol \nand biodiesel comprise less than one percent of all transportation fuel \nin the U.S. This consensus language would require that five billion \ngallons of transportation fuel be comprised of renewable fuel by 2012--\nnearly a tripling of the current ethanol production.\n  The consensus language was agreed to last year after productive \nnegotiations between the renewable fuels industry, farmers' groups, the \noil industry and environmentalists. Unlike many of the disputes during \nconsideration of the energy bill last year, this issue had a relatively \nwide range of agreement. The basis for this agreement is still viable, \nand it is under this framework that we are reintroducing the bill \ntoday.\n  The people of South Dakota and the neighboring states understand the \nbenefits of ethanol to the economies of rural communities. Increased \nrenewable fuel production lowers our dependence upon foreign oil, \nstrengthens energy security, increases farm income and creates jobs. \nThe growth of farmer-owned ethanol plants in South Dakota demonstrates \nthe hard work and commitment needed to serve a growing market for clean \ndomestic fuels.\n  Based on current projections, construction of new plants will \ngenerate $900 million in capital investment and tens of thousands of \nconstruction jobs to rural communities. For corn farmers, the price of \ncorn would rise 20-30 cents per bushel.\n  Combine this with the provisions of the bill and the potential \neconomic impact for rural states is tremendous. In South Dakota, seven \nethanol plants are operating to produce approximately 156 million \ngallons per year. Three other ethanol projects are under construction, \nwith a combined capacity to produce an additional 180 million gallons \nof ethanol annually. With the enactment of a renewable fuels standard, \nthe production in South Dakota now could grow substantially, with at \nleast 5000 farmers owning ethanol plants and producing over 500 million \ngallons of ethanol per year.\n  An important but under-emphasized fuel is biodiesel, which is chiefly \nproduced from excess soybean oil. Soybean prices are hovering near \nhistoric lows. Biodiesel production is small but has been growing \nsteadily. The renewable fuels standard would greatly increase the \nprospects for biodiesel production, benefitting soybean farmers from \nSouth Dakota and other states.\n  While the energy bill was not enacted last year, two-thirds of the \nSenate voted against amendments that would have weakened or eliminated \nthe renewable fuels provision. For the first time in recent memory, \nCongress's actions reflect the knowledge that value-added agriculture \nand ethanol production are critical to the nation's energy needs and to \nthe future of family-farm agriculture and rural America. The prospects \nfor farmers in South Dakota and other rural states have brightened \nconsiderably. Moreover, we have a unique opportunity to help reduce our \nuse of foreign oil and make our nation more stable. I am pleased that \nwe are reintroducing the bill and urge its swift passage.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Madam President, I thank you for the \nopportunity to speak about what is clearly a bipartisan issue. I would \nlike to add to what my colleague from Minnesota said about the Fuels \nSecurity Act offered by Senators Daschle and Lugar on a bipartisan \nbasis.\n  I am here today to support the Fuels Security Act of 2003. This \nimportant renewable fuels legislation is one of the pillars for \neconomic development for rural--America one segment of the population \nthat has lagged behind during the economic surge of the 1990's and is \nsuffering under the combined effects of the current economic slowdown \nand a two-year devastating drought which I had the audacity to name \n``Drought David.''\n  This legislation is important for rural America. Last year, we \ncompleted the farm bill--the first part of the economic revitalization \nplan for rural America. For the last several months, we have been \nstruggling over the most important short-term economic stimulus plan \nfor rural America--comprehensive drought assistance. Though I believe \nwhat the Senate passed and what we hear will be included in the omnibus \nis insufficient to adequately compensate for the drought, it might \nprovide some initial assistance to farmers and ranchers.\n  In addition to the farm bill and disaster assistance, I believe we \nneed to craft a comprehensive rural development plan that will spur \ninvestment in agri-business and promote economic activity in the \nagriculture center. We need to consider opening new markets like Cuba--\nto ensure American products can be sold and farmers and ranchers can \nearn a living.\n  The Fuels Security Act of 2003, is the latest piece of the puzzle.\n  It is clear that use of ethanol, as part of a renewable fuels \nstandard is a win-win-win situation: a win for farmers, a win for \nconsumers, and a win for the environment. That is why I rise as an \noriginal co-sponsor and strong supporter this renewable fuels \nlegislation.\n  If passed, the Fuels Security Act will establish a 2.3 billion gallon \nrenewable fuels standard in 2004, growing every year until it reaches 5 \nbillion gallons by 2012. There are many benefits to this legislation.\n  It will displace 1.6 billion barrels of oil over the next decade; \nreduce our trade deficit by $34.1 billion; increase new investment in \nrural communities by more than $5.3 billion; boost the demand for feed \ngrains and soybeans by more than 1.5 billion bushels over the next \ndecade; create more than 214,000 new jobs throughout the U.S. economy; \nand it will expand household income by an additional $51.7 billion over \nthe next decade\n  It is quite apparent that increased use of ethanol will do much to \nboost a struggling U.S. agriculture economy, and will help establish a \nmore sound national energy policy.\n  The greater production of ethanol will also be beneficial to the \nenvironment. Studies show ethanol reduces emissions of carbon monoxide \nand hydrocarbons by 20 percent and particulates by 40 percent in 1990 \nand newer vehicles. In 2001 ethanol reduced greenhouse gas emissions by \n3.6 million tons, the equivalent of removing more than 520,000 vehicles \nfrom the road.\n  A choice for ethanol is a choice for America, and its energy \nconsumers, its farmers, and its environment.\n  Enactment of the Fuel Security Act will help us to reverse our 100-\nyear-old near total reliance on fossil fuels; a more pressing concern \nthan ever given the possibility of military conflict in the Mid East \nand the continuing economic turmoil in Venezuela.\n  It was recently reported we are currently exporting about 80,000 \ngallons of fuel to Venezuela right now to help in their shortfall \nbecause of the turmoil in that part of our world.\n  I am unabashedly proud of what my home State has accomplished in this \narea. Within the State of Nebraska, during the period from 1991 to \n2001, seven ethanol plants were constructed and several of these \nfacilities were expanded more than once during the decade.\n  Specific benefits of the ethanol program in Nebraska include: $1.15 \nbillion in new capital investment in ethanol processing plants. They \ninclude 1,005 permanent jobs at the ethanol facilities and 5,115 \ninduced jobs directly related to plant construction, operation, and \nmaintenance. The permanent jobs alone generate an annual payroll of $44 \nmillion. And more than 210 million bushels of corn and grain sorghum is \nprocessed at the plants annually. These economic benefits and others \nhave increased each year during the past decade due to plant expansion, \nemployment increases, and additional capital investment.\n  If each State produces 10 percent of its own domestic, renewable \nfuel, as Nebraska does, America will have turned the corner away from \ndependence on foreign sources of energy.\n  And it is possible because ethanol and biodiesel can be made from \nbiomass from other than corn or sorghum or other row crops. It can be \nproduced from garbage. It can be produced from switch grass and all \nkinds of other biomass.\n  When you take a hard look at the facts, you will see that this \nlegislation is nothing but beneficial for America. The Fuels Security \nAct is balanced,\n\n[[Page S2462]]\n\ncomprehensive, and is the result of the dedication of so many, \nespecially Senator Daschle and Senator Lugar.\n  So now I ask my colleagues to join me in promoting new opportunities \nfor the technologies that will put our Nation and the world's \ntransportation fuels on solid, sustainable, and environmentally \nenhancing ground. We owe it to our country now--and to future \ngenerations--to pass this legislation without any further delay.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Madam President, if I may, in contrast to the very \npartisan tone of the Estrada filibuster and this partisan divide that \nis stopping us from moving forward, I want to spend a few minutes \ntalking about an issue in which we come together and perhaps which \nshould be a model.\n  I am pleased to join my distinguished colleagues, Senator Hagel and \nminority leader Daschle, as an original cosponsor of this landmark \nrenewable fuels legislation.\n  Senator Daschle is from our neighboring State. We have mutual \ninterests. We understand the needs of our farmers.\n  We are looking at working together, which I think is such a good \nthing.\n  The Minnesota AgriGrowth Council points out renewable fuels like \nethanol and biodiesel promote the 3 E's: economic development, \nenvironmental protection, and energy independence.\n  Let me talk briefly about the economic development benefit first. I \nran for the Senate on jobs. The best welfare program is a job. The best \nhousing program is a job--creating jobs--and economic development. That \nis what mayors do. That is what they understand is important to moms \nand dads. We get results. There were 18,000 more jobs in St. Paul when \nI left than when I began.\n  The legislation we introduce today means economic development--it \nmeans jobs, revitalization, and new businesses--particularly for rural \nMinnesota.\n  Minnesota is a leader in renewable fuels. Not only do the people of \nmy State make Minnesota the top 10 among States of nearly every \nagriculture commodity that can be produced in our climate, but \nMinnesota leads the way in renewable fuels, and I am proud of that.\n  Today, Minnesota has 14 ethanol plants in production--more than any \nother State in the Nation. Preliminary planning is underway for at \nleast a couple of biodiesel production facilities in my State as well. \nSo the importance of this legislation to my State and to the health of \nthe people in my State and to the lives of our farmers and their \neconomic opportunity is clear.\n  But, let's take a look nationally to see what every American has to \ngain through this legislation. According to at least one economic \nanalysis, the renewable fuels standard we propose today would, over the \nnext decade:\n  Reduce America's trade deficit by more than $34 billion;\n  increase America's Gross Domestic Product by $156 billion;\n  create more than 214,000 jobs throughout the entire economy, \nincluding places important to me like Little Falls and Winnebago, MN; \nand\n  increase net farm income by nearly $6 billion per year.\n  That the renewable fuels standard legislation we introduce today \npromotes the first ``E'' of the 3 ``Es''--economic development--is \nevident.\n  The second ``E'' I want to talk a little about is energy \nindependence.\n  As a member of both the Governmental Affairs Committee and the \nForeign Relations Committee, I have had the opportunity, in my first \nmonth in the Senate, to hear from a number of experts on homeland \nsecurity and on conditions around the world that affect our security. \nAnd, with this experience as a backdrop, I can say I am not comfortable \nat all with America's level of reliance on oil imports--now at 56 \npercent of our supply, and expected to be about 70 percent by 2020 \nunless something is done to turn things around.\n  Back on September 19, 2001, former CIA Director James Woolsey, former \nJoint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Admiral Thomas Moorer, and former \nNational Security Advisor Robert McFarlane all wrote the Senate on this \nvery issue, stating:\n\n       One of the critical actions that must be taken now is to \n     advance America's energy security through transportation \n     fuels like ethanol [and] slow the dollars to the Middle East, \n     where too many of those dollars have been used to buy weapon \n     and fund terrorist activities.\n\n  The legislation we offer today takes to heart the admonition of \nDirector Woolsey, Admiral Moorer, and Mr. McFarlane by advancing \nrenewable fuels to reduce our dependence on foreign oil.\n  And, finally, but not least, is the ``E'' for environmental \nprotection that got the whole reformulated gasoline ball rolling in the \nfirst place.\n  Ethanol is an important tool for improving air quality in America's \ncities by reducing carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, NOX, \ntoxics, and particulates.\n  Proof of ethanol's clear air benefits was seen in Chicago last year \nwhere exclusive use of ethanol reformulated gasoline helped the city \nattain federal ozone standards--the only area under such standards to \nsee this kind of improvement.\n  What is more, ethanol continues to be the only liquid transportation \nfuel that can help to reduce global warming. In 2002 alone, ethanol use \nin the United States reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 4.3 million \ntons--the equivalent of removing more than 636,000 vehicles from the \nroad.\n  These are the 3 ``Es''; economic development, energy independence, \nand environmental protection--all three worthy objectives furthered by \nthe legislation we offer today.\n  Naturally, there are places here and there where this bill can and \nshould be improved, and we can work on it. But, this is a good starting \nplace. It is a bipartisan effort. I am pleased to be an original \ncosponsor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORZINE (for himself, Mr. Fitzgerald, Mr. Sarbanes, and \n        Mr. Akaka):\n  S. 386. A bill to establish a grant program to enhance the financial \nand retirement literacy of mid-life and older Americans and to reduce \nfinancial abuse and fraud among such Americans, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues, Senators \nFitzgerald, Sarbanes, and Akaka to introduce the Education for \nRetirement Security Act of 2003. This bill will provide access to badly \nneeded financial and retirement education for millions of mid-life and \nolder Americans whose retirement security is at stake.\n  Improving financial literacy has been a top priority for me in \nCongress. I believe it is a critical and complex task for Americans of \nall ages, but it is especially crucial for Americans as they approach \nretirement. In fact, low levels of savings and high levels of personal \nand real estate debt are serious problems for many households nearing \nretirement. Although today's older Americans are generally thought to \nbe doing well, nearly one-out-of-five, 18 percent, were living below \n125 percent of the poverty line in 1995, which was a year of tremendous \neconomic prosperity in our Nation. And, only 53 percent of working \nAmericans have any form of pension coverage. In addition, financial \nexploitation is the largest single category of abuse against older \nindividuals, and this population comprises more than one-half of all \ntelemarketing victims in the United States.\n  While education along cannot solve our Nation's retirement woes, \nfinancial education is vital to enabling individuals to avoid scams and \nbad investment, mortgage, and pension decisions, and to ensuring that \nthey have access to the tools they need to make sound financial \ndecisions and prepare appropriately for a secure future. Indeed, the \nmore limited time frame that mid-life and older Americans have in which \nto assess the realities of their individual circumstances, recover from \nbad economic choices, and to benefit from more informed financial \npractices makes this education all the more critical. Financial \nliteracy is also particularly important for older women, who are more \nlikely to live in poverty and be dependent upon Social Security.\n  The Education for Retirement Security act would create a competitive \ngrant program that would provide resources to State and area agencies \non aging and nonprofit community based organizations to provide \nfinancial education programs to mid-life and older Americans. The goal \nof these programs is to enhance these individuals' financial and \nretirement knowledge and reduce their vulnerability to financial\n\n[[Page S2463]]\n\nabuse and fraud, including telemarketing, mortgage, and pension fraud.\n  My legislation also authorizes the creation of a national technical \nassistance program that would designate at least one national nonprofit \norganization that has substantial experience in the field of financial \neducation to provide training and make available instructional \nmaterials and information that promotes financial education.\n  Over the next thirty years, the percentage of Americans aged 65 and \nolder is expected to double, from 35 million to nearly 75 million. \nEnsuring that these individuals are better prepared for retirement and \nare more informed about the economic decisions they face during \nretirement will have an important impact on the long term economic and \nsocial well-being of our Nation.\n  I hope that as the Senate moves to address pension reform, my \ncolleagues will work to address the issues outlined in this \nlegislation. The recent rash of corporate and accounting scandals and \nthe declining stock market have jeopardized the retirement savings of \nmillions of Americans, making the need for financial literacy even more \nclear.\n  In closing, I would like to acknowledge the expertise and assistance \nthat AARP, the Older Women's League, OWL, and the Women's Institute for \na Secure Economic Retirement, WISER, offered to me in drafting this \nlegislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of my legislation be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 386\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Education for Retirement \n     Security Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Improving financial literacy is a critical and complex \n     task for Americans of all ages.\n       (2) Low levels of savings and high levels of personal and \n     real estate debt are serious problems for many households \n     nearing retirement.\n       (3) Only 53 percent of working Americans have any form of \n     pension coverage. Three out of four women aged 65 or over \n     receive no income from employer-provided pensions.\n       (4) The more limited timeframe that mid-life and older \n     individuals and families have to assess the realities of \n     their individual circumstances, to recover from counter-\n     productive choices and decisionmaking processes, and to \n     benefit from more informed financial practices, has immediate \n     impact and near term consequences for Americans nearing or of \n     retirement age.\n       (5) Research indicates that there are now 4 basic sources \n     of retirement income security. Those sources are social \n     security benefits, pensions and savings, healthcare insurance \n     coverage, and, for an increasing number of older individuals, \n     necessary earnings from working during one's ``retirement'' \n     years.\n       (6) The $5,000,000,000,000 loss in stock market equity \n     values since 2000 has had a significantly negative effect on \n     mid-life and older individuals and on their pension plans and \n     retirement accounts, affecting both individuals with plans to \n     retire and those who are already in retirement.\n       (7) Although today's older individuals are generally \n     thought to be doing well, nearly \\1/4\\ (24 percent) of such \n     individuals had annual incomes of less than 14,000 (or 150 \n     percent of the Federal poverty line) between 1998 and 2000.\n       (8) Over the next 30 years, the number of older individuals \n     in the United States is expected to double, from 35,000,000 \n     to nearly 75,000,000, and long-term care costs are expected \n     to skyrocket.\n       (9) Financial exploitation is the largest single category \n     of abuse against older individuals and this population \n     comprises more than \\1/2\\ of all telemarketing victims in the \n     United States.\n       (10) The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Identity Theft Data \n     Clearinghouse has reported that incidents of identity theft \n     targeting individuals over the age of 60 increased from 1,821 \n     victims in 2000 to 5,802 victims in 2001, a threefold \n     increase.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nextend the eligibility periods for geriatric graduate medical \neducation, to permit the expansion of medical residency training \nprograms in geriatric medicine, to provide for reimbursement of care \ncoordination and assessment services\n\n[[Page S2464]]\n\nprovided under the medicare program, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Madam President, today I am pleased to introduce the \nGeriatric Care Act of 2003, a bill to increase the number of \ngeriatricians in our country through training incentives and Medicare \nreimbursement for geriatric care. I am proud to be joined in this \neffort today by Senators Reid, Snowe, Breaux, Graham, Bingaman, \nLandrieu, Murray, Mikulski, Sarbanes, Reed, Kennedy, and Collins.\n  Our country teeters on the brink of revolutionary demographic change \nas baby boomers begin to retire and Medicare begins to care for them.\n  As a member of the Finance Committee and the Special Committee on \nAging, I have a special interest in preparing health care providers and \nMedicare for the inevitable ``aging of America.'' By improving access \nto geriatric care, the Geriatric Care Act of 2003 takes an important \nfirst step in modernizing Medicare for the 21st century.\n  By the year 2030, 70 million Americans will be 65 and older. The \nelderly will soon represent one-fifth of the United States population, \nthe largest proportion of older persons in our Nation's history. Our \nNation's health care system will face an unprecedented strain as our \npopulation grows older. Our Nation is simply ill-prepared for what lies \nahead.\n  Demand for quality care will increase, and we will need physicians \nwho understand the complex health problems that aging inevitably \nbrings. As seniors live longer, they face much greater risks of disease \nand disability. Conditions such as heart disease, cancer, stroke, \ndiabetes and Alzheimer's disease occur more frequently as people age.\n  The complex problems associated with aging require a supply of \nphysicians with special training in geriatrics. Geriatricians are \nphysicians who are first board certified in family practice or internal \nmedicine and then complete additional training in geriatrics.\n  Geriatric medicine provides the most comprehensive health care for \nour most vulnerable seniors. Geriatrics promotes wellness and \npreventive care, helping to improve patients' overall quality of life \nby allowing them greater independence and preventing unnecessary and \ncostly trips to the hospital or other institutions.\n  Geriatricians also have a heightened awareness of the effects of \nprescription drugs. Given our seniors' growing dependence on \nprescriptions, it is increasingly important that physicians know how, \nwhen, and in what dosages to prescribe medicines for seniors. That's \nbecause frequently, older patients respond to medications in different \nways than younger patients.\n  In fact, 35 percent of Americans 65 years and older experience \nadverse drug reactions each year. According to the National Center for \nHealth Statistics, medication problems may be involved in as many as 17 \npercent of all hospitalizations of seniors annually.\n  Care management provided by a geriatrician will not only provide \nbetter health care for our seniors, but will also save costs to \nMedicare in the long term by eliminating more costly medical care in \nhospitals and nursing homes.\n  Quite clearly, geriatrics is a vital thread in the fabric of our \nhealth care system, especially in light of our looming demographic \nchanges.\n  Yet today, there are fewer than 9,000 certified geriatricians in the \nUnited States. Of the approximately 98,000 medical residency and \nfellowship positions supported by Medicare in 1998, only 324 were in \ngeriatric medicine and geriatric psychiatry. Only three medical schools \nin the country, the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, UAMS, \nbeing one of them, has a Department of Geriatrics. This is incredible \nconsidering that all 125 medical schools in our country have \ndepartments of pediatrics.\n  As if that weren't alarming enough, the number of geriatricians is \nexpected to decline dramatically in the next several years. In fact, \nmost of these doctors will retire just as the Baby Boomer generation \nbecomes eligible for Medicare. We must reverse this trend and provide \nincentives to increase the number of geriatricians in our country.\n  Unfortunately, there are barriers preventing physicians from entering \ngeriatrics. These include insufficient Medicare reimbursements for the \nprovision of geriatric care, inadequate training dollars, and too few \npositions for geriatricians.\n  Many practicing geriatricians find it increasingly difficult to focus \ntheir practice exclusively on older patients because of insufficient \nMedicare reimbursement. Unlike most other medical specialties, \ngeriatricians depend almost entirely on Medicare revenues. A recent \nMedPAC report identified low Medicare reimbursement levels as a major \nstumbling block to recruiting new geriatricians.\n  Currently, the reimbursement rate for geriatricians is the same as it \nis for regular physicians. But the services geriatricians provide are \nfundamentally different.\n  Physicians who assess younger patients simply don't have to invest \nthe same time that geriatricians must invest assessing the complex \nneeds of elderly patients. Moreover, chronic illness and multiple \nmedications make medical decision-making more complex and time \nconsuming. Additionally, planning for health care needs becomes more \ncomplicated as geriatricians seek to include both patients and \ncaregivers in the process.\n  We must modernize the Medicare fee schedule to acknowledge the \nimportance of geriatric assessment and care coordination in providing \nhealth care for seniors. Geriatric practices cannot flourish and these \ntrends will not improve until we adjust the system to reflect the \nrealities of senior health care.\n  The Geriatric Care Act I am introducing today addresses these \nshortfalls. This bill provides Medicare coverage for the twin \nfoundations of geriatric practice--geriatric assessment and care \ncoordination.\n  The bill authorizes Medicare to cover these essential services for \nseniors, thereby allowing geriatricians to manage medications \neffectively, to work with other health care providers as a team, and to \nprovide necessary support for caregivers.\n  The Geriatric Care Act also will remove the disincentive caused by \nthe Graduate Medical Education cap established by the 1997 Balanced \nBudget Act. As a result of this cap, many hospitals have eliminated or \nreduced their geriatric training programs.\n  The Geriatric Care Act corrects this problem by allowing for \nadditional geriatric training slots in hospitals. By allowing hospitals \nto exceed the cap placed on their training slots, this bill will help \nincrease the number of residents in geriatric training programs.\n  Finally, the Geriatric Care Act contains a new provision that ensures \nGraduate Medical Education payments for the second year of geriatric \nfellowship training. A one-year fellowship may be adequate for training \nclinical geriatricans but a two-year fellowship is essential for \ntraining academic geriatricans who will teach geriatrics to primary \ncare and specialty physicians-in-training. Academic geriatricians are \ncritical in preparing the next generation of doctors to care for our \ngrowing elderly population.\n  My home State of Arkansas ranks sixth in the Nation in percentage of \npopulation 65 years and older. In a decade, we will rank third. In many \nways, our population in Arkansas is a snapshot of what the rest of the \nUnited States will look like in the near future.\n  We are blessed in Arkansas to have the Donald W. Reynolds Department \nof Geriatrics and the Center on Aging at the University of Arkansas for \nMedical Sciences. It is my hope that the Geriatric Care Act will make \nit easier for our medical school and others across the country to train \nmore physicians in geriatrics.\n  As our parents, grandparents, friends, and loved ones cope with the \nchallenges that aging brings, we must ensure that physicians skilled in \ncaring for their special needs are there to help them. I ask my \ncolleagues to join me in support of this effort to modernize Medicare \nto support crucial geriatric services for our Nation's seniors.\n  I ask unanimous consent that following my statement there be a \nprinted list of organizations that support the Geriatric Care Act of \n2003.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n        Organizations Supporting the Geriatric Care Act of 2003\n\n       Alzheimer's Association.\n\n[[Page S2465]]\n\n       American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry.\n       American Association of Homes and Services for the Aging.\n       American College of Physicians-American Society of Internal \n     Medicine.\n       American Geriatrics Society.\n       Association of Professors of Medicine.\n       Association of Program Directors in Internal Medicine.\n       Association of Subspecialty Professors.\n       Catholic Health Association.\n       International Longevity Center--USA.\n       National Chronic Care Consortium.\n       National Committee to Preserve Social Security and \n     Medicare.\n       National Council on the Aging.\n       National PACE Association.\n       National Family Caregivers Association.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROBERTS (for himself, Mrs. Hutchison, Ms. Collins, and Mr. \n        Jeffords):\n  S. 388. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to expand \nthe dependent car tax credit, to accelerate the child tax credit, and \nto promote dependent care assistance programs; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROBERTS (for himself, Ms. Collins, and Mr. Jeffords):\n  S. 389. A bill to increase the supply of quality child care; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I am pleased and honored to join with my \ncolleagues to introduce two pieces of legislation to help meet the \nchild care challenges facing families around the Nation. These bills \nentitled the ``Caring for Children Act'' and ``A Boost for Child Care \nAct'', or the ABC's Act.\n  Child care, in the home when possible and outside the home when both \nparents work, goes right to the heart of keeping families strong. \nUnfortunately, finding quality, affordable child care is one of the \nmost pressing problems for families in Kansas and around the country. \nIt is estimated that quality child care can cost as much or more than \ncollege tuition in some areas.\n  The ``Caring for Children Act'' and `A Boost for Child Care Act'' \ntake the first steps in addressing this challenge through a responsible \napproach. This legislation expands child care opportunities without \nincreased government costs or intrusion in our lives. This legislation \nbuilds into the existing network adding more government intervention or \nmandates. This legislation will help families that have two working \nparents and families that have a stay-at-home parent. This legislation \nwill help to increase the supply of quality child care.\n  First, in order to provide additional tax relief and increased \naffordability of child care, the ABC's Act expends the Dependent Care \nTax Credit by raising the income level to $30,000 at which families \nbecome eligible for the maximum tax credit. This legislation also \nraises the maximum percentage of child care expenses that parents can \ndeduct to 50 percent. These changes make the Dependent Care Tax Credit \nmore realistic for families that face increasing child care costs. \nAdditionally, the ABC's Act accelerates and makes permanent the child \ntax credit at $1,000 for qualifying taxpayers in order to further ease \nthe financial burden on families.\n  Increasing the income level and the percentage of child care expenses \nthat are deductible will help families where both parents work. But, we \nmust also recognize that families who choose to have one parent remain \nat home have child care expenses as well. Therefore, this legislation \nextends eligibility for the Dependent Care Tax Credit to families with \na stay-at-home parent. This provides greater options to more families \nand leaves child care choices where they should be--with the family. In \norder to target this credit to parents who need it the most and meet \nour fiscal responsibilities, the credit is phased out for higher income \nwage earners.\n  The ``Caring for Children Act'' recognizes that small businesses play \na critical role in providing child care options to millions of working \nparents. Unfortunately, small businesses generally do not have the \nresources required to start up and support a child care center. This \nlegislation includes a short-term flexible grant program to encourage \nsmall businesses to work together to provide child care services for \nemployees. This program is more of a demonstration project that will \nsunset at the end of three years. In the meantime, small businesses \nwill be eligible for grants up to $100,000 for start-up costs, training \nscholarships, or other related activities. Business must continue to \nmeet state quality and health standards. Businesses will be required to \nmatch Federal funds to encourage self-sustaining facilities well into \nthe future.\n  Parental access to child care information and technical assistance to \nchild care providers both play a strong role in increasing the supply \nof quality child care. The Caring for Children Act includes a grant \nprogram to allow entities to develop and operate technology-based child \ncare training infrastructures to enable child care providers to receive \nthe training, education and support they need to improve the quality of \nchild care. The legislation also provides funds for the Department of \nHealth and Human Services to collect and disseminate state of the art \ninformation on topics related to child care health and safety, as well \nas early childhood development. This information could be distributed \nthrough brochures, the internet, a toll-free information hotline, or \nresource and referral organizations.\n\n  Child care is an issue that impacts each and every one of us. While \nparents continue to struggle to meet the constant demand of work and \nfamily, we must continue to do our part to expand child care options \nand protect our nation's most valuable resource, our children. I look \nforward to working with all of my colleagues in this important effort.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the ``Caring for Children \nAct'' and ``A Boost for Child Care Act'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bills were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 388\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to permit \nretired members of the Armed Forces who have a service-connected \ndisability to receive both military retired pay by reason of their \nyears of military service and disability compensation from the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs for their disability; to the Committee \non Armed Services.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, over the last several years, I have tried \nto correct a long-standing injustice impacting our Nation's veterans. \nUnder a law that is now over 110 years old, most veterans who retire \nwith 20 years of honorable service, and who also have a service-related \ndisability, cannot collect both their retirement and their disability \npay.\n  In 2001, I was joined by 82 cosponsors in introducing S. 170, the \n``Retired Pay Restoration Act of 2001.'' Our bill sought to lift the \nrestrictions to allow veterans the ``concurrent receipt'' of both \nretirement compensation and disability benefits. Although we were \nsuccessful in getting the language approved in the National Defense \nAuthorization Act of 2002, now codified at 10 U.S.C. 1414, the \nauthorization was made contingent upon the passage of further \nappropriations. No funds were ever appropriated and concurrent receipt \nremained another unfulfilled promise to our veterans.\n  In 2002, I introduced S. 2051, the ``Retired Pay Restoration Act of \n2002'' to repeal the contingency language and make concurrent receipt a \nreality. The Senate again overwhelmingly passed this measure. \nUnfortunately, the White House threatened a veto of the National \nDefense Authorization Act of 2003, and therefore, the Conference \nCommittee conceded to a compromise proposal, see Section 636 of \nConference Report 107-772. This compromise was a much scaled-back \nversion of concurrent receipt. Senator Warner correctly referred to it \nas a ``beachhead'', but we all acknowledged there was much work \nremaining.\n  Under last year's compromise, only a small number of veterans--\nestimated to be between 15 to 30 thousand--would stand to benefit. The \ncompromise left the contingency language for full concurrent receipt in \nplace, but created a new category of special compensation, now codified \nat 10 U.S.C. 1413(a). In this new category, retirees that had at least \na 60 percent disability rating that was a direct result of armed \nconflict, hazardous service, performance of duty under conditions \nsimulating war, or through an instrumentality of war, would be eligible \nto collect both retirement compensation and disability benefits. Thus, \nthe current law excludes approximately 500,000 disabled veterans who \nhave served their country honorably. To exclude these veterans assumes \nthat they are less deserving of fair compensation because they did not \nincur their injury in combat. The law also creates an unnecessary \nbureaucracy for the VA and the Department of Defense, which currently \ndo not make distinctions based on the specific cause of a service-\nconnected disability.\n  Therefore, I rise today with Mr. McCain, to introduce the ``Retired \nPay Restoration Act of 2003'', along with our colleagues Mr. Akaka, Mr. \nAllard, Mr. Allen, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Biden, Mr. Bingaman, Ms. Boxer, Mr. \nBreaux, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Campbell, Ms. Cantwell, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. \nCorzine, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Dayton, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Durbin, Ms. \nFeinstein, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Johnson, Ms. \nLandrieu, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Levin, Mr. Lieberman, Ms. Lincoln, Mr. Miller, \nMr. Nelson of Nebraska, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. Roberts, Mr. \nRockefeller, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Smith, and Ms. Snowe, to correct this \ninequity for veterans who have retired from our Armed Forces with a \nservice-connected disability.\n  Our bill removes the contingency language for full concurrent receipt \ncurrently found at 10 U.S.C 1414(a) and (f), and repeals the Special \nCompensation programs codified at 10 U.S.C. 1413 and 1413(a). The \neffect would be to finally implement full concurrent receipt, thereby \nending the 110 year inequity.\n  Passage and implementation of this bill is long overdue. I am sure \nmany of my colleagues would be interested to learn that Congress \nimposed these restrictions on concurrent receipt just after the Civil \nWar, when the standing army of the United States was extremely limited. \nAt that time, only a small portion of our armed forces consisted of \ncareer soldiers.\n  Today, nearly one and a half million Americans dedicate their lives \nto the\n\n[[Page S2468]]\n\ndefense of our Nation. The United States' military force is unmatched \nin terms of power, training and ability. Our Nation's status as the \nworld's only superpower is largely due to the sacrifices our veterans \nmade during the last century. Rather than honoring their commitment and \nbravery by fulfilling our obligations, the federal government has \nchosen instead to perpetuate a longstanding injustice. Quite simply, \nthis is disgraceful, and we must correct it.\n  Once again our Nation is calling upon the members of the Armed Forces \nto defend democracy and freedom in Afghanistan, in the Persian Gulf and \nthroughout the world. We must send a signal to the men and women \ncurrently in uniform that our government takes care of those that make \nsacrifices for our Nation. We must demonstrate to veterans that we are \nthankful for their dedicated service.\n  Military retirement pay and disability compensation are earned and \nawarded for entirely different purposes. Current law ignores the \ndistinction between these two entitlements. Military retired pay is \nearned compensation for the extraordinary demands and sacrifices \ninherent in a military career. It is a reward promised for serving two \ndecades or more under conditions that most Americans find intolerable. \nVeterans' disability compensation, on the other hand, is paid to \nrecompense pain, suffering, and lost future earning power caused by a \nservice-connected illness or injury. Few retirees can afford to live on \ntheir retired pay alone, and a severe disability only makes the problem \nworse by limiting or denying any post-service working life.\n  Career military retired veterans are the only group of Federal \nretirees who are required to waive their retirement pay in order to \nreceive VA disability benefits. All other Federal employees receive \nboth their civil service retirement and VA disability with no offset. \nSimply put, the law discriminates against career military men and \nwomen. It assumes, in effect, that disabled military retirees neither \nneed nor deserve the full compensation they earned for their 20 or more \nyears served in uniform.\n  This inequity is absurd. How do we explain it to the men and women \nwho sacrificed their own safety to protect this great nation? How do we \nexplain this inequity to those members currently risking their lives to \ndefeat terror?\n  We are currently losing over one thousand World War II veterans each \nday. Every day we delay acting on this legislation means continuing to \ndeny fundamental fairness to thousands of men and women. They will \nnever have the ability to enjoy their two well-deserved entitlements.\n  This bill represents an honest attempt to correct an injustice that \nhas existed for far too long. Allowing disabled veterans to receive \nmilitary retired pay and veterans disability compensation concurrently \nwill restore fairness to Federal retirement policy.\n  This legislation is supported by numerous veterans' service \norganizations, including the Military Coalition, the National Military/\nVeterans Alliance, the American Legion, the Disabled American Veterans, \nthe Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Fleet Reservists Association, the \nMilitary Officer's Association, the Paralyzed Veterans of America and \nthe Uniformed Services Disabled Retirees.\n  Passing this bill will finally eliminate a grossly inequitable 19th \ncentury law and ensure fairness within the Federal retirement policy. \nOur veterans have heard enough excuses.

Madam President, I first introduced legislation on this \nissue all the way back in 1992. Then again in 1993, then again in 1994, \nthen again in 1995. In 1999, I drafted legislation that became law--as \na compromise measure that paid special compensation pay for severely \ndisabled military retirees with disabilities greater than 50 percent. \nHere we are in 2003 with an opportunity to finally rectify a problem \nthat has plagued our veterans and to rectify it, once and for all, for \nall military retirees who have become disabled during their military \nservice.\n  I know personally the character of Americans who take up arms to \ndefend our Nation's interests and to advance our democratic values. I \nknow of all the battles, all the grim tests of courage and character, \nthat have made a legend of the Army, Navy, Marine Corps and Air Forces \ndevotion to duty.\n  Let me remind this body of the grave sacrifice that our men and women \nwho risk their lives for their country must endure. The United States \nhas exerted military force more than 280 times since the end of World \nWard II. We are even now engaged in an epic struggle against a new and \nhidden enemy that involves the men and women of our armed forces.\n  Once again our young men and women are defiantly heading into harms \nway with the understanding that we, as the lawmakers of this great \nNation, will ensure they are taken care of as citizens and as veterans \nfor their actions above and beyond the call of duty.\n  We now have an opportunity to show a measure of our gratitude to \nthese brave men and women, and for the future men and women who \ncontinue to serve in this time of trial.\n\n[[Page S2469]]\n\n  The existing law as it stands is simply discriminatory and wrong. \n``Concurrent receipt'' is, at its core, a fairness issue, and present \nlaw simply discriminates against career military people who have been \ninjured or disabled while in conduct of their duties while in defense \nof this great Nation. Retired veterans are the only group of federal \nretirees who are required to waive their retirement pay in order to \nreceive VA disability compensation.\n  In my view, the two pays are for very different purposes; one for \nloyal and selfless service to our country. The other for physical or \nmental `pain and suffering' occurred in that service to country.\n  The Retired Pay Restoration Act has received strong bipartisan \nsupport in Congress for several years.\n  The Military Coalition, an organization of 33 prominent veterans' and \nretirees' advocacy groups, supports this legislation, as do many other \nveterans' service organizations, including the Veterans of Foreign \nWars, American Legion and Disabled American Veterans.\n  For the brave men and women who have selected to make their career in \nthe U.S. military, they face an unknown risk. If they are injured, they \nwill be forced to forego their earned retired pay in order to receive \ntheir VA disability compensation. In effect, they will be paying for \ntheir own disability benefits from their retirement checks.\n  It is long overdue for us to redress the unfair practice of requiring \ndisabled military retirees to fund their own disability compensation. \nSixty percent is not enough! We need full funding for all military \nretirees. It is time to show our appreciation to the men and women who \nhave sacrificed so much for our great Nation.\n  Therefore, I am proud to rise today with Mr. Reid, to introduce the \n``Retired Pay Restoration Act of 2003'', along with our colleagues Mr. \nAkaka, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Biden, Mr. Bingaman, Ms. Boxer, Mr. \nBreaux, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Cochran, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Corzine, Mr. \nDaschle, Mr. Dayton, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Durbin, Ms. Feinstein, Mr. Inouye, \nMr. Johnson, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Levin, Mr. Lieberman, Ms. \nLincoln, Mr. Miller, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. \nRockefeller, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Allard, Mr. Allen, Mr. Brownback, Mr. \nCampbell, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Smith, and Ms. \nSnowe, to correct this inequity for veterans who have retired from our \nArmed Forces with a service-connected disability.\n  I am thankful for the Senate's action to address this important issue \ntoday and I urge the Chairman and Ranking Member to carry this \nlegislative provision through Conference and final passage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLEN:\n  S. 393.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na 3-year extension of the credit for producing electricity from wind; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce important tax \nlegislation on behalf of myself and Senators Baucus, Conrad, Crapo, \nBreaux, Leahy, Harkin, Durbin, Craig, Johnson, Chafee, Snowe, and \nKerry.\n  This bill, entitled the ``Bipartisan Renewable Efficient Energy with \nZero Effluent, BREEZE, Act,'' extends the production tax credit for \nelectricity generated by wind for three years. The current tax credit \nis set to expire on January 1, 2004.\n  As the author of the Wind Energy Incentives Act of 1993, I sought to \ngive this alternative energy source the ability to compete against \ntraditional, finite energy sources. I strongly believe that the \nexpansion and development of wind energy must be facilitated by this \nproduction tax credit.\n  Wind, unlike most energy sources, is an efficient and environmentally \nsafe form of energy production. Wind energy makes valuable \ncontributions to maintaining cleaner air and a cleaner environment. \nEvery 10,000 megawatts of wind energy produced in the United States can \nreduce carbon monoxide emissions by 33 million metric tons by replacing \nthe combustion of fossil fuels.\n  Since the inception of the wind energy production tax credit in 1993, \nmore than 3,000 megawatts of generating capacity have been put online. \nThis generating capacity powers nearly 900,000 homes.\n  Just last year, over 400 megawatts of new wind energy capacity was \ninstalled, bringing total capacity to more than 4,500 megawatts. Wind \nenergy is currently serving the equivalent of more than 1.3 million \naverage American homes in 27 states across the country.\n  During the past two decades, the price of wind energy has been \nreduced more than 80 percent, making it one of the least expensive \nsources of renewable energy. In order to continue this investment and \ndevelopment in America's energy future, we must extend the production \ntax credit.\n  From 1999 to 2001, wind energy capacity in Iowa grew by 33 percent, \nand while Iowa ranks tenth in the nation in terms of wind energy \npotential, Iowa currently ranks third nationally in wind development, \nwith over 400 megawatts of generating capacity. Only California and \nTexas generate more electricity from wind than Iowa. And, the Iowa \nDepartment of Natural Resources estimates that Iowa has the potential \nto produce nearly 5 times its own annual electrical needs through wind \npower.\n  Wind energy also produces substantial economic benefits. For each \nwind turbine, a farmer or rancher can receive more than $2,000 per year \nfor 20 years in direct lease payments. Iowa's major wind farms already \npay more than $640,000 per year to landowners.\n\n  Equally important, wind energy increases our energy independence, \nthereby providing the United States with insulation from an oil supply \ndominated by the Middle East. Our national security is currently \nthreatened by a heavy reliance on oil from abroad.\n\n[[Page S2471]]\n\n  Unfortunately, due to the structure of the current tax incentive, a \nsignificant portion of the electricity industry is unable to take \nadvantage of the credit. Rural electric cooperatives and municipal \nutilities provide power to nearly 25 percent of the Nation's consumers. \nTo encourage a unified national energy plan, it's only fair to give \ncooperatives and other not-for-profit utilities the ability to use \nrenewable tax incentives.\n  REC's and municipal utilities should be given a mechanism to utilize \nthe tax incentives for renewable electricity generation. And, while the \nlegislation I'm introducing today does not address this issue, I look \nforward to working with my colleagues on the Finance Committee to \ninclude such a mechanism in a comprehensive energy tax package.\n  Extending the wind energy tad credit would allow for even greater \nexpansion and planning stability in the wind energy field. Wind is a \ndomestically produced natural resource, found abundantly across the \ncountry. Because wind energy is homegrown, it cannot be controlled by \nany foreign power.\n  Wind energy can be harnessed without injury to our environment. Wind \nis a reliable form of power that is renewable and inextinguishable. \nThis legislation ensures that wind energy does not fall by the wayside \nas a productive alternative energy source.\n  The Senate needs to extend this important incentive and I encourage \nmy colleagues to join us in this effort.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 395\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Bipartisan Renewable, \n     Efficient Energy with Zero Effluent (BREEZE) Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. 3-YEAR EXTENSION OF CREDIT FOR PRODUCING ELECTRICITY \n                   FROM WIND.\n\n       Section 45(c)(3)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 \n     (relating to wind facility) is amended by striking ``January \n     1, 2004'' and inserting ``January 1, 2007''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself and Mr. GRASSLEY):\n  S. 396. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to exempt \nsmall manufacturers from the firearms excise tax; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Gunsmith \nExcise Tax Simplification Act of 2003. This bill will protect funding \nfor the Federal Aid to Wildlife Restoration Fund by simplifying \nadministration and compliance with the excise tax by eliminating the \nassessment of the tax against custom gunsmiths.\n  The creation of the Federal Aid to Wildlife Restoration Fund is one \nof the great success stories of cooperation among America's sportsmen \nand women, state fish and wildlife agencies, and the sporting goods \nindustry. Working together with Congress, Americans who enjoy the \noutdoors volunteered to pay an excise tax on sporting arms and \nammunition to be used for hunter education programs, wildlife \nrestoration, and habitat conservation.\n  Under the tax code, all manufacturers of firearms must pay an excise \ntax of 10 percent or 11 percent of the retail price, depending on the \ntype of firearm. For more than 25 years custom gunsmiths have sought to \nclarify that they were not intended to be subject to this tax. Many \ncustom gunsmiths do not actually make new guns, rather they remodel or \nrefurbish existing firearms. The proposal establishes an exemption from \nthe excise tax for manufacturers of fewer than 50 firearms per year.\n  This issue is important to individuals in Montana. Steven Dodd \nHughes, a custom gunmaker in Livingston, MT, pays this tax. He has a \nsole proprietorship, a one man shop. Steven's business is generated \nfrom outside of Montana and brings in much needed revenue to his \ncommunity. He agrees with the tax as it was intended, on manufacturers. \nIt was not intended to be applied to one man operations such as his. \nThe American Custom Gunmakers Guild and the NRA agree with Mr. Hughes.\n  In summary, the Gunsmith Excise Tax Simplification Act of 2003 would \naccomplish two worthy objectives. First, this proposal will eliminate \nthe assessment of the excise tax on custom gunmakers, which is fair. \nSecond it eliminates the significant administrative burden placed on \nsmall businesses, such as determining who the manufacturer is and who \nis going to assess and collect the tax. These custom gunmakers rebuild \nand update the firearms, they don't administer tax laws. Last year, the \nJoint Committee on Taxation estimated the proposal will decrease \nrevenues by less than $10 million over ten years, resulting in minimal \nreduction of the Federal Aid to Wildlife Restoration Fund.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill entitled ``The \nGunsmith Excise Tax Simplification Act of 2003'' be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 396\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \ndeduction for the old-age, survivors, and disability insurance taxes \npaid by employees and self-employed individuals, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, 194 years ago this week, a son was born to \nNancy and Thomas Lincoln in Elizabethtown, Kentucky. That son, Abraham, \nwould go on to become President of the United States at one of the most \ndefining times in our Nation's history.\n  President Lincoln is still revered today for his leadership and \nvision of a country in which all citizens have the opportunity to \nsucceed. In 1864, when the outcomes of the war and his re-election were \nin question, he asked soldiers from Ohio's 66th regiment to stop at the \nWhite House on their way home so he could express his appreciation. \nPresident Lincoln shared with them the following:\n  ``I beg you to remember this . . . I happen temporarily to occupy \nthis big White House. I am a living witness that any one of your \nchildren may look to come here as my father's child has. It is in order \nthat each of you may have through this free government which we have \nenjoyed, an open field and a fair chance for your industry, enterprise \nand intelligence; that you may all have equal privileges in the race of \nlife, with all its desirable human aspirations. It is for this the \nstruggle would be maintained, that we may not lose our birthright . . . \nThe nation is worth fighting for, to secure such an inestimable \njewel.''\n  That jewel--the American dream that should be within reach of all who \ngrasp for it--has been the hope of generations in this nation. This \nNation that elected Abraham Lincoln--born in a one-room log cabin and \nonce a farmhand . . . This Nation that harvests in its children a \nyearning to soar beyond the earth's atmosphere . . . This Nation that \npreaches that education, hard work, and family bring success.\n  Unfortunately, making a living, raising a family, and educating \nourselves and our children is becoming more and more difficult in \nAmerica. And it's the\n\n[[Page S2472]]\n\nleaders of this nation that have made the obstacles to success higher \nto get over and wider to get around.\n  Here in Washington, we've built a wall of obstacles with one tax \nburden after another. Our Founding Fathers outlined exactly the powers \nthey wanted Congress to have in Article I, Section 8 of the \nConstitution. Just because the first thing listed is the power to lay \nand collect taxes, doesn't mean it's the power we need to exercise the \nmost.\n  Not only should we take the responsibility of stopping the building \nof this wall of tax burdens, we need to step up and start removing \nthese burdens. We need to alleviate the tremendous stress that comes \nwith having to work to pay so much of what we earn to the government.\n  Last year, the average taxpayer in my home State of Nevada did not \nfinish paying taxes until April 27, which was also the average across \nthe United States. Everything earned for the first 117 days of the year \nwent to a government entity. In comparison, the average American spends \nonly 106 days paying for food, clothing, and shelter combined.\n  That doesn't leave enough days to pay for a family vacation or to \nsave for education or to pay medical bills or to save for retirement or \nto take a class to improve skills or to do whatever you want with your \nmoney--after all, it is your money.\n  In itself, our tax system is unfair because American families have to \nwork harder to make more money only to pay greater taxes, and workers \nbear the burden of a government that continues to find ways to tax them \ninto working even harder.\n  Whatever our individual thoughts are on tax relief, we must agree \nthat, although being taxed has become a challenging part of life, the \nidea of being double taxed is truly the government stealing from \nworking Americans. Double taxation is immoral. Think about it in terms \nof a parent teaching a child. I am a parent of three young children. \nJust as I would explain to my children that it is not all right to take \na piece of candy that they have not paid for, I would also tell them it \nis absolutely not okay to charge someone for something they aren't \ngetting. But that is exactly what our government is doing with the \nSocial Security tax.\n  Time magazine recently called it ``The Really Unfair Tax.'' I call it \nthe Social Security double dip. The take-home pay of 100 million \nAmericans is fodder for this gutsy government scam. In very simple \nterms, this means that when a family pays income tax, the portion that \nis withheld for Social Security--money that they never see--is \ncalculated into their personal income. The first dip is the tax that \nworkers pay on wage income. The second dip is the icing on the cake for \nthe government--taxing money that they are already taking anyway. \nWorking Americans are forced to pay income tax on their Social Security \ntax. It is textbook double taxation, and if a business concocted such a \nscheme it would be shut down. How can we continue this policy if we \nwould teach our children that it is wrong? This is only one reason why \nthe tax is unfair.\n  Another example of the outrageousness of this tax is that while \nworking families are double taxed, American businesses are not. You \nsee, half the Social Security tax is paid by workers, but employers pay \nthe other half. Businesses and corporations get to deduct what they pay \nin Social Security taxes--a savings that working families are not \nafforded. This tax discrimination is unacceptable.\n  We must eliminate this absolutely wrong tax policy that mocks our \nConstitution's goal to ``promote the general Welfare.'' I propose an \nabove-the-line deduction for Social Security taxes so that an \nindividual's Social Security taxes are not included in the calculation \nof income for income tax purposes. It's the right thing to do if we \nwant to lead this Nation by example. Providing a Social Security tax \ndeduction makes sense and will make a real difference to working \nfamilies. About 100 million individuals and families would feel the \nsavings--to the tune of around $2,000 each. Such savings translate into \nreal growth and opportunity. Scholars predict that the Payroll Tax \nDeduction Act would mean 900,000 new jobs in this country, and it also \nmeans a Nation of workers who get to keep more of their hard-earned \nmoney.\n  When government takes money away from working families, it stifles \ngrowth and builds obstacles to success. Let's take this chance to \nprovide relief to America's families, open the doors to opportunity, \nand let future generations know that the American dream--the jewel that \ninspired Abraham Lincoln--is well within the reach of all who truly \ndesire it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 397\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize grants for the establishment of quasi-\njudicial campus drug courts at colleges and universities modeled after \nState drug courts programs; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Madam President, today I introduce the ``Campus \nClassmate Offenders in Rehabilitation and Treatment Act of 2003.''\n  The legislation I am introducing today is based on legislation I \npreviously introduced toward the end of the 107th Congress.\n  The Campus Classmate Offenders in Rehabilitation and Treatment Act, \nwhich can also be referred to as the ``Campus CORT Act,'' directs the \nDepartment of Justice to establish a demonstration program to provide \ngrants and training to help our Nation's universities and colleges \nestablish new quasi-judicial systems. These systems aim at countering \nthe serious drug and substance abuse related problems that are taking \nsuch a heavy toll on our institutions of higher learning and the \nstudents who attend them. The demonstration program, which would be \nadministered by the Department of Justice's Office of Justice Programs, \nwould be based on the valuable lessons and successes we have garnered \nfrom our Nation's innovative and expanding drug court system.\n  Specifically, this demonstration program legislation would authorize \nthe establishment of up to five Campus CORTs each year for Fiscal Years \n2004 through 2007. The bill authorizes the Office of Justice Programs \nto provide $2,000,000 in Federal funding during each of those years to \nhelp get five Campus CORTs well trained, soundly established and up and \nrunning. This new program's approach should be similar to how the \nOffice of Justice Programs currently runs the ongoing drug court grant-\nmaking program, including providing an Internet-based application \nprocess.\n  There are plenty of good reasons to take the next step and establish \na Campus CORTs program based on the drug court model. Since they first \nappeared in 1989, drug courts have rapidly spread all across the \nNation. Rather than simply locking-up nonviolent drug offenders in \nprison along side violent criminals, drug courts provide the \nalternative of court-supervised treatment. Instead of simply punishing, \ndrug courts help get people clean.\n  Drug courts' many successes are underscored both by the bipartisan \nsupport they have received in Congress and by the Bush Administration. \nFor example, during a national conference hosted this last April by the \nNational Association of Drug Court Professionals, both Office of \nNational Drug Control Policy Director John Walters, our Nation's ``Drug \nCzar,'' and Drug Enforcement Agency Director Asa Hutchinson gave \nspeeches in support of drug courts and the benefits they provide.\n  According to the latest statistics as reported by the Department of \nJustice's Office of Justice Programs, as of November 2002, 946 Drug \nCourts are operating all across the United States. This is an \nimpressive increase of approximately 250 Drug Courts over the past \nyear. This 946 Drug Courts includes 547 Adult Drug Courts, 245 Juvenile \nDrug Courts, 59 Family Drug Courts and 14 Combination Courts. Over 400 \nadditional new Drug Courts are in the planning process.\n  The report goes on to state that approximately 300,000 adults and \n12,000 juveniles have been enrolled in the drug court system to date. \nOf those participants, 73,000 adults and 4,500 juveniles have \nsuccessfully graduated from Drug Courts.\n  The merits of the drug court system are well documented. Nationwide, \ndrug courts have been instrumental in enabling more than 1,000 children \nto be born drug free, more than 3,500 parents to regain custody of \ntheir children, and 4,500 parents to resume making their child-support \npayments. The retention rate is over 70 percent with 73 percent of the \nparticipants managing to keep their jobs or successfully find new work. \nThese are encouraging statistics, and not just for the individuals \ninvolved, but for society as a whole.\n  While it is not as easy to measure, we know that Drug Courts play a \nbeneficial role in reducing criminal behavior since so much crime these \ndays is drug related.\n  Drug Courts also help save up money. It is estimated that every \ndollar spent on Drug Courts saves our country and communities \napproximately ten dollars in reduced prison and other criminal justice \ncosts.\n  These are the kind of successes we should be able to see once the \ndrug court model is customized and applied through Campus CORTs as we \nwork together to respond to the alcohol, drug and other substance abuse \nchallenges facing our Nation's colleges and universities.\n  Just as drugs are deeply interconnected with crime on our streets, \ndrugs and serious substance abuse are also interconnected with much of \nthe academic failure that damages so many of our Nation's institutions \nof higher learning and their aspiring students seeking college degrees.\n  Our Nation's drug courts use a carrot and stick approach where \noffenders can either live at home and remain free to work under court \nsupervised treatment or face the very real threat of hard jail time. \nSimilarly, Campus CORTs will give troubled students the chance to get \nsupervised treatment and stay clean or get kicked out of school and \nwatch their futures get squandered away.\n  Instead of simply booting students with substance abuse problems \ndirectly out of school, as is currently happening at many universities \nand colleges all across the country, I believe we should instead help \nprovide institutions of higher learning with new tools they can use to \nhelp students get and stay clean. Of course, just like it is with the \nexisting drug courts, there will be some students who simply do not \nrespond to Campus CORTs. While those students will have to face the \nfact that they may well be expelled from school, at least we will have \nbeen able to give them the opportunity to clean-up their act.\n\n[[Page S2474]]\n\n  Since the new Campus CORTs would be established at colleges and \nuniversities, the legislation calls on the Office of Justice Programs, \nor OJP, to establish new ``quasi-judicial standards and procedures for \ndisciplinary cases'' for institutions of higher learning that wish to \nparticipate in the new Federal program.\n  Today, I am pleased to highlight that one of the leading institutions \nof higher learning in my home State, Colorado State University, CSU, \nhas already broken new ground as the Nation's first university to apply \nthe drug court concept in a campus setting. The ``Day IV'' program, as \nit is known at CSU, has racked-up a successful record in helping keep \nstudents clean and in school.\n  Our Drug Court system is making a difference all across our Nation. \nIn fact, a 2002 report issued by Columbia University's prestigious \nNational Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse states that ``Drug \nCourts provide closer, more comprehensive supervision and much more \nfrequent drug testing and monitoring during the program, than other \nforms of community supervision.'' The report underscores that ``drug \nuse and criminal behavior are substantially reduced while offenders are \nparticipating in drug court'' and that ``criminal behavior is lower \nafter participation, especially for graduates.''\n  Our Nation's Drug Court system is a good example of a viable and \nproductive partnership between the Federal Government our State \ngovernments and local jurisdictions. Their collaboration is making a \npositive impact all across our country. I want to take this moment to \nthank the people of the OJP, the experts at the National Association of \nDrug Court Professionals and the state and local judges, prosecutors, \nlaw enforcement officers and other officials who have done so much to \nestablish, build upon and continually improve our Nation's drug court \nsystem.\n  I also want to take a moment to thank Judge Karen Freeman Wilson, \nChief Executive Officer of the National Association of Drug Court \nProfessionals for her letter of support for the Campus CORT legislation \nI am introducing today. It is appreciated.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter of support and the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                     Drug Court Professionals,\n\n                                 Alexandria, VA, January 15, 2003.\n     Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Campbell: As the representative of the \n     National Association of Drug Court Professionals (NADCP) and \n     of drug court professionals throughout the country, I am \n     writing this letter of support for the Campus Classmate \n     Offenders in Rehabilitation and Treatment (CORT) Act'' which \n     I understand you will be introducing in the Senate in the \n     near future. Not only are campus drug courts a natural \n     progression of the traditional drug court system which has \n     proliferated successfully throughout the country for more \n     than a decade, but they also will serve as yet another \n     mechanism to reduce drug abuse and its concomitant crime.\n       Drug court professionals throughout the country truly \n     appreciate your tenacious support and are eager to work \n     collectively with you and other legislators to ensure that \n     substance-abusing students are reached early and do not \n     continuously cycle through the revolving door of the criminal \n     justice system.\n       Because of your in depth knowledge of the substance abuse \n     and its concomitant crime, you are already aware that drug \n     and alcohol abuse is not limited to a specific age, gender or \n     race. However, according to the 2001 National Household \n     Survey on Drug Abuse, approximately 15.9 million Americans \n     aged 12 or older were current users of an illicit drug in \n     2001, representing 7.1% of the population. The highest rate \n     of use was found among young adults (ages 18-25) with 18.8% \n     reporting current use and among youth (ages 12-17) with \n     10.8%. Current use of any illicit drug in the population aged \n     12 and older increased significantly from 6.3% in 2000 to \n     7.1% in 2001. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services \n     Administration reported an equally alarming statistic in its \n     fact sheet entitled ``Consequences of Underage Alcohol Use'' \n     as it stated in 1998, there were 8,844 arrests for drug law \n     violations on 487 college campuses.\n       Unfortunately, the 2001 National Household Survey on Drug \n     Abuse and other studies clearly indicate that the need still \n     exists to invest more attention to the rising problem of drug \n     abuse, specifically on college campuses, throughout the \n     country. Drug courts have already proven that an early \n     investment in treatment obviates the need for repeated \n     investments in incarceration and allow previously addicted \n     offenders to lead healthy, productive lives within their \n     communities. Campus drug courts are the natural extension of \n     drug courts and will combat campus drug and alcohol abuse \n     head on, thereby preventing accidents and crimes at colleges \n     and universities throughout the nation.\n       Thank you once again for you stanch support of the drug \n     court field and for introducing the ``Campus CORT Act.'' I \n     look forward to providing support to this and similar \n     legislation and to working with you and your staff in the \n     future.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                Judge Karen Freeman-Wilson (ret.),\n     Chief Executive Officer.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                                 S. 399\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to increase to \nparity with other surviving spouses the basic annuity that is provided \nunder the uniformed services Survivor Benefit Plan for surviving \nspouses who are at least 62 years of age; and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Armed Services.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on an issue of \ngreat importance to our military retirees. This issue I want to address \nis the Survivor's Benefit Plan and the need to eliminate the Social \nSecurity offset.\n  The Survivor's Benefit Plan, SBP, has been in existence for nearly 30 \nyears. Under this plan, military retirees may contribute part of their \nmonthly retirement pay to the SBP, with the knowledge that after their \ndeath, their spouses can continue to receive 55 percent of their \nmonthly retirement pay. But, when the surviving spouse reaches the age \nof 62, something disturbing happens. At the age of 62, the widow or \nwidower of a military retiree sees his or her payments under the SBP \nshrink to 35 percent. This reduction is an offset for the Social \nSecurity payments that the survivor has begun to collect.\n  The survivors of military retirees find this to be unjust, and \nrightly so. The SBP is a fund that their spouses payed into, with the \nexpectation that their survivors would be taken care of\n\n[[Page S2475]]\n\nafter they pass away. The SBP is not a lavish monthly payment, but \nreflects the low salaries that men and women on active duty receive. In \na recent article in the Shreveport Times, Billie Combs, who is 73, and \nis the widow of an Air Force Master Sergeant commented on the strain \nthat the Social Security Offset imposes on their budget. She said: ``It \ncurtails my spending. It stops me from buying the things that I need; I \njust cut back and make sure that I have enough to carry me through to \nthe next month.''\n  The legislation that I introduce today would slowly phase out the \nsocial security offset to Survivor Benefit Plan, reducing it \nsignificantly by 2007, and completely erasing it by 2013.\n  Those who choose the military as their profession don't do it for the \nmoney. They do it because they have a love for country. They have a \nlove for country that runs so deep, they would gladly sacrifice their \nlives in defense of the homeland. Despite the extreme sacrifice our \nSoldiers, Sailors, Airmen, and Marines are willing to make, they are \nnot well compensated. And we don't just ask the servicemen to \nsacrifice, we ask their families to make a sacrifice. They endure long \nperiods of separation, they live in military housing which in many \ncases is substandard, and we ask them to get by on low pay. The least \nwe can do for our servicemen is to given them a decent retirement \nsystem. The very least we can do for their widows, is to restore the \nfunds that are unjustly removed from their survivor's benefit plan.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article and the text \nof this bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              Military Widows Lose Chunk of Benefits at 62\n\n                           (By Dennis Camire)\n\n       Washington.--Some survivors of military retirees have a \n     rude awakening when they turn 62 and find their income from a \n     Defense Department pension plan slashed.\n       Many who enrolled in the survivor annuity plan in the 1970s \n     say they understood their surviving spouses would receive 55 \n     percent of their retirement pay for life.\n       But that's not the case. The benefit droops to as low as 35 \n     percent when survivors reach 62. Retires who have paid \n     decades of premiums say they feel betrayed.\n       ``I like to have dropped dead right there,'' Marion \n     Charles, 78, said in finding out about the reduction after \n     her husband, Edward, died last year, ``In fact, I wondered \n     why God didn't take me with Ed.''\n       Charles of Plant City, Fla., was left struggling with \n     funeral expenses, credit card debts and house maintenance \n     bills after she saw her income drop by $1,200 a month upon \n     the death of her husband, who retired in 1966 as a Navy chief \n     petty officer. She now lives in a damaged 28-foot travel \n     trailer and gets by with help from the Navy-Marine Corps \n     Relief Society.\n       Though the annuity covers all spouses of military service \n     members who don't opt out, women overwhelmingly are affected \n     because most who have chosen the military as a career through \n     the years have been men.\n       ``It curtails my spending. It stops me from buying the \n     things I want and need,'' said Billie Combs, 73, of Bossier \n     City, widow of an Air Force master sergeant who died in 1995. \n     ``I just cut back and make sure I have enough to carry me \n     over to the next month.''\n       Lee Lange of the Military Officers Association of America \n     called the cutback wrong. ``It just seems counter-intuitive \n     that we would be cutting their benefit as they get older.''\n       Benefits for elderly widows and widowers at the 35 percent \n     level are modest even for relatively senior officers, Lange \n     said. For many widows of enlisted service members, the money \n     amounts to less than $5,000 a year.\n       About 800,000 of the nation's 1.9 million retirees are \n     paying 6.5 percent of their retirement pay to participate \n     in the plan, and more than 250,000 survivors are \n     collecting the benefits.\n       Service members automatically are enrolled in the program \n     when they retire but can opt out if they and their spouses \n     sign a form.\n       The controversial drop is called a Social Security offset. \n     The theory behind the drop was that the plan should give a \n     survivor access to about 55 percent of the member's retired \n     pay--but from all sources related to military service, \n     including Social Security.\n       The offset began as a dollar-for-dollar reduction but was \n     changed in 1985 to the current plan. Survivors whose spouses \n     were eligible to retire by Oct. 1, 1985, may have the offset \n     computed under the old system or the new to gain the best \n     benefit. The offset is computed only upon death of the \n     retiree.\n       Veteran's organizations--including the Military Officers \n     Association, the Non-commissioned Offers Association, the \n     American Legion and the Fleet Reserve Association--want \n     Congress to eliminate the benefit reduction.\n       The Military Coalition, a group of 33 military and veterans \n     groups, plans to push for elimination of the cutback as an \n     issue of fairness and equity for the survivors.\n       That's how Combs of Bossier City sees it.\n       ``I would tell Congress to worry about the widows. Worry \n     about the women that are left behind and don't have very much \n     money and are never really able to get on their feet,'' Combs \n     said.\n       ``Imagine if all the wives told their husbands to get out \n     of the military, that they could make a better living on the \n     outside, then where would we be? But we didn't do that \n     because they made a promise to us. And now we are having to \n     fight for it.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                                 S. 401\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to abolish the death penalty under Federal law; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I introduce the Federal Death \nPenalty Abolition Act of 2003. This bill would abolish the death \npenalty at the Federal level. It would put an immediate\n\n[[Page S2476]]\n\nhalt to executions and forbid the imposition of the death penalty as a \nsentence for violations of Federal law.\n  Since 1976, when the death penalty was reinstated by the Supreme \nCourt, there have been 830 executions across the country, including two \nat the Federal level. At the same time, 103 people on death row were \nlater found innocent and released from death row. Exonerated inmates \nare not only removed from death row, but they are usually released from \nprison altogether. Apparently, these people never should have been \nconvicted in the first place. While death penalty proponents claim that \nthe death penalty is fair, efficient, and a deterrent, the fact remains \nthat our criminal justice system has failed and has resulted in at \nleast 103 very grave mistakes.\n  Eight hundred and thirty executions, and 103 exonerations. Those are \nnot good odds. It is an embarrassing statistic, one that should have us \nall questioning the use of capital punishment in this country.\n  Since January 25, 2001, when I last introduced this bill, the Federal \nGovernment resumed executions for the first time in almost 40 years, \nand 138 people have been executed nationwide. In this new year, we have \nbegun our use of capital punishment at an alarming pace. We are only in \nthe second week of February, and there have already been 10 executions \nthis year. And yet this one-to-eight error rate looms. Is it possible \nthat those 10 people are representative of the one-to-eight error rate \nthat has plagued the death penalty since it was reinstated in 1976? Is \nit possible that in the last six weeks, as we have debated a war in \nIraq, funding levels for Federal programs, and judicial nominations, \nour nation has killed an innocent person?\n  It is a difficult question to ask, but an even more difficult one to \nignore.\n  While executions continue and the death row population grows, the \nnational debate on the death penalty continues and has become even more \nvigorous. The number of voices joining in to express doubt about the \nuse of capital punishment in America is growing. As evidence of the \nflaws in our system mounts, it has created an awareness that has not \nescaped the attention of the American people. Layer after layer of \nconfidence in the death penalty system has been gradually peeling away, \nand the voices of those questioning its fairness are growing louder and \nlouder. Now they can be heard from college campuses and court rooms and \npodiums across the Nation, to the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing \nroom, to the Supreme Court. We must not ignore them.\n  That our society relies on killing as punishment is disturbing \nenough. Even more disturbing, however, is that the States' and Federal \nGovernment's use of the death penalty is often not consistent with \nprinciples of due process, fairness, and justice. These principles are \nthe foundation of our criminal justice system. It is more clear than \never before that we have put innocent people on death row. In addition, \nstatistics show that those States that have the death penalty are more \nlikely to put people to death for killing white victims than for \nkilling black victims.\n  After the death penalty was reinstated in 1976, the Federal \nGovernment first resumed death penalty prosecutions after enactment of \na 1988 Federal law that provided for the death penalty for murder in \nthe course of a drug-kingpin conspiracy. The Federal death penalty was \nthen expanded significantly in 1994, when the omnibus crime bill \nallowed its use to apply to a total of some 60 Federal offenses. Since \n1994, Federal prosecutions seeking the death penalty have now \naccelerated.\n  A survey on the Federal death penalty system from 1988 to early 2000 \nwas released by the U.S. Department of Justice in September 2000. That \nreport showed troubling racial and geographic disparities in the \nfederal government's administration of the death penalty. In other \nwords, who lives and who dies in the Federal system appears to relate \nto the color of the defendant's skin or the region of the country where \nthe defendant is prosecuted. Attorney General Janet Reno was so \ndisturbed by the results of that report that she ordered a further, in-\ndepth study of the results. Attorney General John Ashcroft pledged to \ncontinue that study, but we still await the results of that further \nstudy. The Federal Government should do all that it can to ensure that \nno person is ever subject to harsher penalties, most importantly that \nof capital punishment, because of the color of the defendant's skin.\n  I am certain that not one of my colleagues here in the Senate, not a \nsingle one, would defend racial discrimination in this ultimate \npunishment. The most fundamental guarantee of our Constitution is equal \njustice under law, and equal protection of the laws.\n  While the Federal death penalty system is clearly plagued by flaws, \nthere are 38 States across our Nation that also authorize the use of \ncapital punishment. And like the Federal system, those systems are not \nfree from error.\n  Over three years ago, Governor George Ryan took the historic step of \nplacing a moratorium on executions in Illinois and creating an \nindependent, blue ribbon commission to review the State's death penalty \nsystem. The Commission conducted an extensive study of the death \npenalty in Illinois and released a report with 85 recommendations for \nreform of the death penalty system. The Commission concluded that the \ndeath penalty system is not fair, and that the risk of executing the \ninnocent is alarming real. Governor Ryan recently pardoned four death \nrow inmates and commuted the sentences of all remaining Illinois death \nrow inmates, after the State legislature failed to enact even one of \nthe Commission's recommendations.\n  Illinois is not alone. Two years ago, then Governor Parris Glendening \nlearned of suspected racial disparities in the administration of the \ndeath penalty in Maryland. Governor Glendening did not look the other \nway. He commissioned the University of Maryland to conduct the most \nexhaustive study of Maryland's application of the death penalty in \nhistory. Then last year, faced with the rapid approach of a scheduled \nexecution, Governor Glendening acknowledged that it was unacceptable to \nallow executions to take place while the study he had ordered was not \nyet complete. So, in May 2002, he placed a moratorium on executions.\n  That study was released in January and the findings should startle us \nall. The study found that blacks accused of killing whites are simply \nmore likely to receive a death sentence than blacks who kill blacks, or \nthan white killers. According to the report, black offenders who kill \nwhites are four times as likely to be sentenced to death as blacks who \nkill blacks, and twice as likely to get a death sentence as whites who \nkill whites.\n  Maryland and Illinois are not exceptions to a rule, nor anomalies in \nan otherwise perfect system. In fact, since reinstatement of the modern \ndeath penalty, 81 percent of capital cases across the country have \ninvolved white victims, even though only 50 percent of murder victims \nare white. Nationwide, more than half of the death row inmates are \nAfrican Americans or Hispanic Americans.\n  There is evidence of racial disparities, inadequate counsel, \nprosecutorial misconduct, and false scientific evidence in death \npenalty systems across the country. While the research done in Maryland \nand Illinois has yielded shocking results, there are 36 other States \nthat authorize the use of the death penalty, most of them far more \nfrequently. Twenty-one of the 38 States that authorize capital \npunishment have executed more inmates than Maryland, and 13 of those \nStates have carried out more executions than Illinois. So while we are \ncloser to uncovering the unthinkable truth about the flaws in the \nMaryland and Illinois death penalty systems, there are 36 other states \nwith systems that are most likely plagued with the same flaws. And yet, \nthe killing continues.\n  At the beginning of 2003, at the beginning of a new century and \nmillennium with hopes for great progress, I cannot help but believe \nthat our progress has been tarnished by our Nation's not only \ncontinuing, but increasing use of the death penalty. We are a Nation \nthat prides itself on the fundamental principles of justice, liberty, \nequality and due process. We are a Nation that scrutinizes the human \nrights records of other nations. We are one of the first nations to \nspeak out against torture and killings by foreign governments. We \nshould hold our own system of justice to the highest standard.\n  Over the last two years, some prominent voices in our country have \ndone\n\n[[Page S2477]]\n\njust that. And they are not just voices of liberals, or of the faith \ncommunity. They are the voices of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, Reverend \nPat Robertson, George Will, former FBI Director William Sessions, \nRepublican Governor George Ryan, and Democratic Governor Parris \nGlending. The voices of those questioning our application of the death \npenalty are growing in number, and they are growing louder.\n  And while we examine the flaws in our death penalty system, we cannot \nhelp but note that our use of the death penalty stands in stark \ncontrast to the majority of nations, which have abolished the death \npenalty in law or practice. There are now 111 countries that have \nabolished the death penalty in law or in practice. The European Union \ndenies membership in the alliance to those nations that use the death \npenalty. In fact, it passed a resolution calling for the immediate and \nunconditional global abolition of the death penalty, and it \nspecifically called on all states within the United States to abolish \nthe death penalty. This is significant because it reflects the \nunanimous view of a group of nations with which the United States \nenjoys the closest of relationships.\n  On February 5, 2003, the International Court of Justice, ICJ, ruled \nunanimously that the United States must temporarily stay the execution \nof three Mexican citizens on death row in Texas and Oklahoma. There are \ncurrently 112 foreign nationals on death row in this country. Under \nArticle 36 of the 1963 Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, local \nauthorities are required to notify all detained foreigners ``without \ndelay'' of their right to have their consulate informed of their \ndetention. In most cases, this international law is not being followed. \nIn fact, only seven cases of 152 reported death sentences have been \nidentified as meeting complete compliance with Article 36 requirements. \nThe purpose of this law is to ensure that foreign nationals are allowed \ntime to secure adequate counsel during the critical stages of their \ncases. The February ruling of the ICJ was based on the need for an \ninvestigation into whether the foreign nationals on death row were ever \ngiven their right to legal assistance from their home governments.\n  What is even more troubling in the international context is that the \nUnited States is now one of only seven countries that imposes the death \npenalty for crimes committed by juveniles. So, while a May 2002 Gallup \npoll found that 69 percent of Americans oppose the death penalty for \nthose under the age of 18, we are one of only seven nations on this \nearth that puts to death people who were under 18 years of age when \nthey committed their crimes. The other are Iran, the Democratic \nRepublican of the Congo, Pakistan, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and Yemen. In \nthe last decade, the United States has executed more juvenile offenders \nthan all other nations combined, and in the last three years, only four \nnations have executed juvenile offenders: Iran, the Congo, Pakistan, \nand the United States.\n  Iran, the Congo, and Pakistan are countries that are often criticized \nfor human rights abuses. We should remove any grounds for charges that \nhuman rights violations are taking place on our own soil by halting the \nexecution of people who were not even adults when they committed the \ncrimes for which they were sentenced to die. No one can reasonably \nargue that executing child offenders is a normal or acceptable practice \nin the world community. And I do not think that we should be proud that \nthe United States is the world leader in the execution of child \noffenders.\n  As we begin a new year and another Congress, our society is still far \nfrom fully just. The continued use of the death penalty shames us. The \npenalty is at odds with our best traditions. It is wrong and it is \nimmoral. The adage ``two wrongs do not make a right,'' applies here. \nOur nation has long ago done away with other barbaric punishments like \nwhipping and cutting off the ears of suspected criminals. Just as our \nnation did away with these punishments as contrary to our humanity and \nideals, it is time to abolish the death penalty as we seek justice in \nthis new century. And it's not just a matter of morality. The continued \nviability of our justice system as a truly just system requires that we \ndo so. And our Nation's striving to remain the leader and defender of \nfreedom, liberty and equality demands that we do so.\n  Abolishing the death penalty will not be an easy task. It will take \npatience, persistence, and courage. As we work to move forward in a \nrapidly changing world, let us leave this archaic practice behind.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in taking the first step in abolishing \nthe death penalty in our great Nation. I also call on each State that \nauthorizes the use of the death penalty to cease this practice. Let us \nstep away from the culture of violence and restore fairness and \nintegrity to our criminal justice system.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 402\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to lift the trade embargo on Cuba, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I rise today to introduce the Free Trade \nwith Cuba Act of 2003. This legislation presents an important step \ntoward normalizing United States economic relations with Cuba and \nopening a dialog between our two nations. Perhaps more importantly, the \nbill promotes human rights and democracy in a nation that has suffered \nunder totalitarian rule for more than 4 decades, an objective central \nto the same democratic principles that have driven our foreign policy \nsince the end of the Second World War.\n  The Free Trade with Cuba Act contains three essential components. \nFirst, it lifts the trade embargo against Cuba and eliminates the \ntravel ban that accompanies the embargo. Second, it graduates Cuba from \nJackson-Vanik and authorizes the President to extend nondiscriminatory \ntrade treatment to Cuba. Finally, it removes the restrictions on travel \nbetween our two countries.\n  This legislation is similar to the legislation I introduced in the \nlast Congress, S. 400 and S. 401. That legislation was referred to the \nFinance Committee. I am hopeful the committee can pass favorably on \nthis legislation quickly so we can bring it to the floor and pass it.\n  This legislation is long overdue. In 1962, the United States \nembargoed virtually all trade with Cuba as a response to the rise of \nthe totalitarian regime and seizure of American property. Over the \nyears, U.S. sanctions against Cuba were further tightened, culminating \nwith restrictions on the rights of Americans to visit Cuba.\n  Within the context of the cold war, many of these sanctions seemed to \nmake sense. Yet throughout that time the embargo appeared to have \nlittle, if any, effect on the Castro regime. Forty years of the \nembargo, 4 decades of disengagement, have simply not worked. It is time \nto try a new approach. It is time for engagement.\n  Supporters of the embargo throw out many arguments against the \nlegislation. First, they will say that private property of U.S. \ncitizens that was taken in the early days of the Castro regime compels \nus to refuse trade with Cuba until we get the property back. They point \nout horrendous treatment of Cuban citizens by Castro and denial of the \nmost basic human rights is also a reason. Let us be clear. These are \nproblems and they must be resolved. Yet, the debate is not whether \nthese problems exist. They do exist, of course, they exist. That is not \nthe issue. We all know that.\n  The question, rather, is how to solve it. Forty years of embargo have \ndone nothing to regain private assets taken so long ago by Castro and \n40 years of embargo have done nothing to improve the living conditions \nand prospects for democratic reform in Cuba.\n  I have been to Cuba and visited Cuba. The people are in terrible \nshape. If anything, the embargo has lessened the prospects for reform \nby giving Castro someone else to blame for the terrible economic plight \nof his people. This embargo, frankly, is something Castro loves. It is \na foil. He can blame the United States for some of the ills of his \ncitizens. It is working in the opposite direction. In other words, \nwhile the problems may seem complicated, the one thing we can say we do \nknow for certain is this: Current policy is not the answer; the current \npolicy is a failure.\n  We must look to alternatives. How would this legislation resolve \nthese problems? First, as to expropriation, the legislation I am \nproposing today calls for the President to undertake negotiations with \nthe government of Cuba to settle this issue and make sure those harmed \nby this expropriation are fairly compensated. Second, as to the crucial \nissues of human rights and democratic reform, the legislation simply \nreflects the commonsense truth that engagement between the American and \nCuban peoples will do much more to open Cuban society and help Cuban \npeople, as it has around the world for 200 years, than silence and \nneglect--so similar to the question we had of China not too many years \nago.\n  What did we do with China? The answer was very simple: We engaged. We\n\n[[Page S2479]]\n\nengaged without losing. China is a country. We are a country. Let's \nengage again. The same is true for Cuba: They are a country, we are a \ncountry, let's start talking and figure out how to solve things.\n  We should not delude ourselves. Embargo is a word for neglect. By not \nengaging the Cuban people and opening our world and tradition to them, \nwe are neglecting them.\n  Last year we worked hard to further trade liberalization, passing the \nTrade Act of 2002. When the President signed that bill he said this:\n\n       Free trade is also a proven strategy for building global \n     prosperity and adding to the momentum of political freedom. \n     Greater freedom for commerce across the borders eventually \n     leads to greater freedom for citizens within the borders.\n\n  I agree. This statement is as true for Cuba as it is for any other \ncountry.\n  Third, on the economics of this, sure, we are in tough times. The \neconomy is flat. Our farmers and workers are hurting, but there is a \nmarket worth up to $1 billion a year we are shutting ourselves out, \ndenying ourselves. It makes no sense. The embargo against Cuba \naccomplishes nothing, and hurts our farmers and workers and companies \nby excluding them from a great potential market. Meanwhile, the \nEuropean Union, Japan, Mexico, Canada, dozens of other countries, are \nbusy selling goods and building commercial relations in Cuba. We are \nnot. They are. Ask me the rationale of that.\n  There is a final point regarding the basic rights of freedoms of the \nAmerican people. It is a fundamental violation of the spirit of our \ndemocratic principles to tell the American people they cannot travel to \nCuba. What a sad irony is trying to promote freedom and democracy in \nanother country by restricting it in our own. It is time to get real \nabout this. It is time to get real about promoting freedom and \ndemocracy, it is time to get real regarding economic expansion, and it \nis time to end the embargo.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BUNNING (for himself and Mr. Brownback):\n  S. 404. A bill to protect children from exploitive child modeling, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise to introduce, along with Senator \nSam Brownback, the Child Modeling Exploitation Prevention Act.\n  Many Senators may not be aware of what I am talking about. I was not \nuntil recently, and I think it is important to raise awareness of the \nissue. Once my colleagues see what it is I am talking about, I am sure \nthey will join in supporting my bill.\n  The Internet sites we are talking about are disturbing and dangerous. \nI wanted to have some enlarged pictures to illustrate what I am talking \nabout, but the images are indecent and would only be further exploiting \nthese children.\n  What I am talking about are websites with pictures and videos of \nchildren--mostly girls between the ages of 7 and 14, barely clothed and \nin revealing positions--being sold on the Internet. For $25 a month at \none site, you can look at pictures of a sweet and tender child being \nturned into a prostitute. She hikes up her skirt and poses in a bikini \non a bearskin rug.\n  What is the point of this? It is not to sell a bearskin rug or an \narticle of clothing or any other product. There is one thing being \nsold: A child as a sex object.\n  But there's more to this site. For $50 you can purchase a video of \nthis little girl dancing and running around in skimpy outfits that \nleave little to the imagination.\n  Normal people do not visit these sites. The primary viewers of these \nInternet sites are grown men. Some are pedophiles. Some are even \nregistered sex offenders.\n  And what is more disturbing is that some of these children are put on \ndisplay by their parents. It is absurd that a parent would do this to \ntheir own child for cash.\n  Some parents even allow Internet viewers to interact with their \nchildren through e-mail. Some even make personal videos for subscribers \nand allow them to send in clothes for the girls to model.\n  This is wrong. Any sane and logical person knows it is wrong. And \nthat is why Congress should do something about it.\n  I am not talking about children modeling clothes in a Sears catalog. \nI am not talking about kids advertising shoes or jackets.\n  That is fine. And legitimate marketing of products is not illegal \nunder my bill.\n  This bill has been carefully crafted to protect legitimate modeling \nactivities and to not trample on the First Amendment.\n  Children are precious.\n  I know firsthand because I have 9 of my own. I also have 35 \ngrandchildren, and 3 great-grandchildren. And I don't want any of \nthem--or any other children--growing up in a world where we exploit \nchildren in a sexual way.\n  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this bill and end exploitive child \nmodeling.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 404\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Child Modeling Exploitation \n     Prevention Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The use of children in the production of exploitive \n     child modeling, including on Internet websites, in \n     photographs, films, videos, and other visual depictions, is a \n     form of child abuse that can result in physical and \n     psychological harm to the children involved.\n       (2) Exploitive child modeling is different from other, \n     legitimate, child modeling because exploitive child modeling \n     involves marketing the child himself or herself in lascivious \n     positions and acts, rather than actually marketing products \n     to average American consumers.\n       (3) The purpose of exploitive child modeling is to satisfy \n     the demand of pedophiles.\n       (4) Unlike legitimate child modeling, exploitive child \n     modeling may involve a direct and personal interaction \n     between the child model and the pedophile. The pedophile \n     often knows the child's name and has a way of communicating \n     with the child.\n       (5) The interaction between the exploited child model and \n     the pedophile can lead the child to trust pedophiles and to \n     believe that it is acceptable and safe to meet with \n     pedophiles in private.\n       (6) Over 70 percent of convicted pedophiles have used child \n     pornography or exploitive child modeling depictions to whet \n     their sexual appetites. Because children are used in its \n     production, exploitive child modeling can place the child in \n     danger of being abducted, abused, or murdered by the \n     pedophiles who view such depictions.\n       (7) These exploitive exhibitions of children are \n     unacceptable by social standards and lead to a direct harm to \n     the children involved.\n\n     SEC. 3. EMPLOYMENT IN EXPLOITIVE CHILD MODELING.\n\n       (a) Prohibition on Employment.--Section 12 of the Fair \n     Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 212) is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n       ``(e)(1) No employer may employ a child model in exploitive \n     child modeling.\n       ``(2) Notwithstanding section 16(a), whoever violates \n     paragraph (1) shall be fined under title 18 or imprisoned not \n     more than 10 years, or both.\n       ``(3)(A) In this subsection, the term `exploitive child \n     modeling' means modeling involving the use of a child under \n     17 years old for financial gain without the purpose of \n     marketing a product or service other than the image of the \n     child.\n       ``(B) Such term applies to any such use, regardless of \n     whether the employment relationship of the child is direct or \n     indirect, or contractual or noncontractual, or is termed that \n     of an independent contractor.\n       ``(C) Such term does not apply to an image which, taken as \n     a whole, has serious literary, artistic, political, or \n     scientific value.''.\n       (b) Oppressive Child Labor.--Section 3(l) of such Act (29 \n     U.S.C. 203(l)) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``(1) any'' and inserting ``(A) any'';\n       (2) by striking ``(2) any'' and inserting ``(B) any'';\n       (3) by inserting ``(1)'' after ``(l)''; and\n       (4) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n       ``(2) Such term includes employment of a minor in violation \n     of section 12(e)(1).''.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to provide loan forgiveness to social workers who work \nfor child protective agencies; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, I join several of my colleagues today to \nintroduce a series of bills related to the reauthorization of the \nHigher Education Act (HEA). These five bills emphasize a number of \nissues that are vital to higher education, including teacher quality; \nloan forgiveness for social workers, family lawyers, and early \nchildhood teachers; and the reduction of drug use and underage drinking \nat our colleges and universities.\n  The quality of a student's education is the direct result of the \nquality of that student's teachers. If we don't have well trained \nteachers, then future generations of our children will not be well \neducated. That is why I am introducing a bill that would provide $200 \nmillion in grants to our schools of education to partner with local \nschools to ensure that our teachers are receiving the best, most \nextensive training available before they enter the classroom.\n  The Secretary of Education's annual report on teacher quality \nreported that a majority of graduates of schools of education believe \nthat the traditional teacher preparation program left them ill prepared \nfor the challenges and rigors of the classroom. Part of the \nresponsibility for this lies in the hands of our schools of education. \nHowever, Congress also has a responsibility to give our schools of \neducation the tools they need to make necessary improvements. This new \nbill would create a competitive grant program for schools of education, \nwhich partner with low-income schools to create clinical programs to \ntrain teachers. Additionally, it would require schools of education to \nmake internal changes by working with other departments at the \nuniversity to ensure that teachers are receiving the highest quality \neducation in core academic subjects. Finally, it would require the \ncollege or university to demonstrate a commitment to improving their \nschools of education by providing matching funds.\n  Another complex issue affecting the teaching force is the high \npercentage of disillusioned beginning teachers who leave the field. Our \nbill would help combat this issue, as well. Schools of education \nreceiving these grants would be responsible for following their \ngraduates and continuing to provide assistance after they enter the \nclassroom. The more we invest in the education of teachers--especially \nonce they have entered the profession--the more likely they will remain \nin the classroom.\n  Today, I also would like to introduce, along with Senator Dodd, the \nEarly Care and Education Loan Forgiveness Act. Our dear friend and \ncolleague, Senator Wellstone, and I had included this legislation in \nthe last higher education reauthorization bill. We had been working on \nthis legislation together before Paul's tragic death. I know he cared \ndeeply about this issue and about making sure that all children receive \na quality education. He was passionate about that. And, in his memory, \nI would like to rename our bill the Paul Wellstone Early Educator Loan \nForgiveness Act.\n  This bill would expand the loan forgiveness program so that it \nbenefits not just childcare workers, but also early childhood \neducators. This loan forgiveness program would serve as an incentive to \nkeep those educators in the field for longer periods of time.\n  Paul Wellstone knew how important early learning programs are in \npreparing our children for kindergarten and beyond. Research shows that \nchildren who attend quality early childcare programs when they were \nthree or four years old scored better on math, language arts, and \nsocial skills in early elementary school than children who attended \npoor quality childcare programs. In short, children in early learning \nprograms with high quality teachers--teachers with a bachelor's degree \nor an associate's degree or higher--do substantially better.\n  When we examine the number and recent growth of pre-primary education \nprograms, it becomes difficult to differentiate between early education \nand childcare settings because they are so often intertwined--\nespecially considering that 11.9 million children younger than age five \nspend part of their time with a care provider other than a parent and \nthat demand for quality childcare and education is growing as more \nmothers enter the workforce.\n  Because this bill targets loan forgiveness to those educators working \nin low-income schools or childcare settings, we can make significant \nstrides toward providing high quality education for all of our young \nchildren, regardless of socioeconomic status. The bill would serve a \ntwofold function. First, it would reward professionals for their \ntraining. Second, it would encourage professionals to remain in the \nprofession over longer periods of time, since more time in the \nprofession leads to higher percentages of loans forgiveness. The bill \nwould result in more educated individuals with more teaching experience \nand lower turnover rates, each of which enhance student performance.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join me in this effort to ensure that \ntruly no children--especially our youngest children--are left behind.\n  I also am working on two bills with my friend and colleague from West \nVirginia, Senator Jay Rockefeller. These bills would provide loan \nforgiveness to students who dedicate their careers to working in the \nrealm of child welfare, including social workers, who work for child \nprotective services, and family law experts.\n  Currently, Mr. President, there aren't enough social workers to fill \navailable jobs in child welfare today. Furthermore, the number of \nsocial work job openings is expected to increase faster than the \naverage for all occupations through 2010. The need for highly qualified \nsocial workers in the child protective services is reaching crisis \nlevel.\n  We also need more qualified individuals focusing on family law. The \nwonderful thing about family law is its focus on rehabilitation--that \nis the rehabilitation of families by helping them through life's \ntransitions, whether it is a family going through a divorce, a family \ndealing with their troubled teenager in the juvenile system, or a child \ngetting adopted and becoming a member of a new family.\n  Across the United States, family, juvenile, and domestic relations \ncourts are experiencing a shortage of qualified attorneys. As many of \nmy colleagues and I know, law school is an expensive\n\n[[Page S2481]]\n\ninvestment. In the last 20 years, tuition has increased more than 200 \npercent. Currently, the average rate of law school debt is about \n$80,000 per graduate. To be sure, few law school graduates can afford \nto work in the public sector because debts prevent even the most \ndedicated public service lawyer from being able to take these low-\npaying jobs. This results in a shortage of family lawyers.\n  The shortage of family law attorneys also disproportionately impacts \njuveniles. The lack of available representation causes children to \nspend more time in foster care because cases are adjourned or postponed \nwhen they simply cannot find an attorney to represent their rights or \nthose of the parent or guardian. Furthermore, the number of children \ninvolved in the court system is sharply increasing. We need to ensure \nthat the interests of these children are taken care of by making \ncertain they have an advocate--someone working solely on their behalf. \nBy offering loan forgiveness to those willing to pursue careers in the \nchild welfare field, we can increase the number of highly qualified and \ndedicated individuals who work in the realm of child welfare and family \nlaw.\n  Finally, I am introducing a bill today with my friend and colleague \nfrom Connecticut, Senator Lieberman, that would help address an \nepidemic--the epidemic of underage drinking, binge drinking, and drug-\nrelated problems on college and university campuses across the United \nStates. Our bill would provide grants to states to establish statewide \npartnerships among colleges and universities and the surrounding \ncommunities to work together to reduce underage and binge drinking and \nillicit drug use by students.\n  According to a study by Boston University, over 1,400 students aged \n18-24 died in 1998 from alcohol-related injuries, more than 600,000 \nstudents were assaulted by another student, and another 500,000 were \ninjured unintentionally while under the influence of alcohol. According \nto a 1999 Harvard University study, 40 percent of college students are \nbinge drinkers and according to the Department of Health and Human \nServices, nearly 10.5 million current drinkers were under the legal age \nof 21, and of these, over 5 million were binge drinkers.\n  Currently, 28 States, including my home State of Ohio, have \ncoalitions that deal specifically with the culture of alcohol and drug \nabuse on our nation's college campuses. They work with the surrounding \ncommunities, including local residents, bar, restaurant and shop \nowners, and law enforcement officials, toward a goal of changing the \npervasive culture of drug and alcohol abuse. They provide alternative \nalcohol-free events, as well as support groups for those who choose not \nto drink. They also educate students about the dangers of alcohol and \ndrug-use.\n  Furthermore, the coalitions recognize that while it is important to \npromote an alcohol aware and drug-free campus community, if the \ncommunity surrounding the campus does not promote these initiatives, \nthere will be no long-term solutions. Therefore, these coalitions also \nhave worked to establish regulations both on and off campus, which will \nhelp our nation's youth to stay healthy, alive, and get the most out of \ntheir time at college. Some of these regulations include the \nregistration of kegs. This provides accountability for both the store \nand the student. This is just an example of one step that colleges, \nlocal communities, and organizations can take.\n  To help start the expansion of these coalitions, our bill would \nprovide $50 million in grants. This is an important demonstration \nproject that would help lead to positive effects for our young people. \nIt is up to us to change the culture, which has been perpetuated by \nyears of complacency and a dismissal tone of--``that's just the way it \nis in college.'' We must protect the health and education of our young \npeople by changing this culture of abuse--and that is exactly what this \nbill would do.\n  Next year when we consider the reauthorization of the Higher \nEducation Act, I encourage my colleagues to join in support of these \ninitiatives.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bills be printing in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bills were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 405\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Paul Wellstone Early \n     Educator Loan Forgiveness Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1)(A) The first 5 years of a child's life are a time of \n     momentous change.\n       (B) Research shows that a child's brain size doubles \n     between birth and age 3.\n       (2) New scientific research shows that the electrical \n     activity of the brain cells actually changes the physical \n     structure of the brain, and that without a stimulating \n     environment, a baby's brain suffers.\n       (3) Research also indicates that there is a connection \n     between the cognitive, social, emotional, and physical \n     stimulation young children receive from their early childhood \n     teachers and caregivers and success in learning, school \n     readiness, and intellectual growth. There are important \n     short- and long-term effects of that stimulation on cognition \n     and social development.\n       (4) High quality early childhood education correlates with \n     better language development, mathematics abilities, and \n     social skills.\n       (5) 11,900,000 children younger than age 5 spend part of \n     their time with a child care provider other than a parent. By \n     2000, 64 percent of 3- to 5-year-olds were enrolled in some \n     type of preschool program. Demand for child care is growing \n     as more mothers enter the workforce.\n       (6) Good quality child care, in a healthy and safe \n     environment, with trained, caring providers who provide age-\n     appropriate, developmentally appropriate, and effective \n     activities, helps children grow and thrive. Recent research \n     shows that most child care needs significant improvement.\n       (7) Good quality child care depends largely on the \n     provider, yet providers of child care earn on average $7.86 \n     per hour, or $16,350 per year. Such earnings cause high \n     annual turnover, up to 31 percent of the staff in some child \n     care programs. High turnover affects the overall quality of a \n     child care program and causes anxiety for children.\n       (8) Children attending lower quality child care programs \n     and child care programs with high staff turnover are less \n     competent in language and social development than other \n     children.\n       (9) The quality of child care is primarily related to high \n     staff-to-child ratios, staff education, professional \n     development, and administrators' prior experience. In \n     addition, certain characteristics distinguish poor, mediocre, \n     and good quality child care programs, the most important of \n     which are teacher wages, education, and specialized training.\n       (10) Each State requires kindergarten teachers to hold at \n     least a bachelor's degree and certificate in early childhood \n     education. Only 20 States and the District of Columbia \n     require teachers in prekindergarten programs to satisfy those \n     requirements. Thirty States allow caregivers with no previous \n     training to work in child care programs.\n\n     SEC. 3.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Communities Combating \n     College Drinking and Drug Use Act''.\n\n     SEC 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Alcohol is by far the drug most widely used and abused \n     by young people in the United States.\n       (2)(A) In 2003, it is illegal for youths under the age of \n     21 to purchase alcohol in all of the 50 States and the \n     District of Columbia, and illicit drugs remain illegal.\n       (B) According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, on \n     average, young people begin drinking at about age 13. \n     However, some start even younger. By the time young people \n     are high school seniors, more than 80 percent have used \n     alcohol and approximately 64 percent have been drunk.\n       (C) When adolescents move on to college, they bring their \n     drinking habits with them. According to a 1993-1997 Harvard \n     School of Public Health College Alcohol Study, 40 percent of \n     college students are binge drinkers.\n       (D) According to the Department of Health and Human \n     Services, in 1998, 10,400,000 current drinkers were under \n     legal age (age 12-21) and of these, 5,100,000 were binge \n     drinkers, including 2,300,000 heavy drinkers.\n       (E) Among 10th graders the perceived harmfulness of \n     regularly taking LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide) is 68.8 \n     percent, and among 8th graders the perceived harmfulness is \n     52.9 percent, according to the 2001 Monitoring the Future \n     Study (MTF) funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse.\n       (F) Only 45.7 percent of 12th graders perceived a great \n     risk in trying MDMA (ecstasy) once or twice.\n       (G) The perceived availability of crack and cocaine among \n     10th graders was thought of as easy or fairly easy by 31 \n     percent of 10th graders.\n       (3)(A) Underage drinking particularly impacts institutions \n     of higher education.\n       (B) In 1999, Harvard University's School of Public Health \n     College Alcohol Study surveyed 119 colleges and found that \n     students who were binge drinkers in high school were 3 times \n     more likely to binge drink in college.\n       (C) According to a March 2002 article published in the \n     Journal of Studies on Alcohol, a study conducted by the \n     Social and Behavioral Sciences Department of the Boston \n     University School of Public Health reported that 1998 and \n     1999 studies show over 2,000,000 of the 8,000,000 college \n     students in the United States drove under the influence of \n     alcohol, over 500,000 were unintentionally injured while \n     under the influence of alcohol, and over 600,000 were hit or \n     assaulted by another student who had been drinking.\n       (D) According to the same Boston University study, it is \n     estimated that over 1,400 students aged 18-24 and enrolled in \n     2-year and 4-year colleges died in 1998 from alcohol-related \n     unintentional injuries.\n       (E) More than 600,000 students between the ages of 18 and \n     24 are assaulted by another student who has been drinking, \n     and another 500,000 students are unintentionally injured \n     under the influence of alcohol.\n       (F) More than 70,000 students between the ages of 18 and 24 \n     are victims of alcohol-related sexual assault or date rape, \n     more than 400,000 students reported having unprotected sex, \n     and more than 100,000 students reported having been too \n     intoxicated to know if they consented to having sex, \n     according to the Boston University study.\n\n[[Page S2483]]\n\n       (4)(A) Longstanding cultural influences perpetuate student \n     patterns of drinking.\n       (B) Of frequent binge drinkers, 73 percent of males and 68 \n     percent of females cited drinking to get drunk as an \n     important reason for drinking according to ``Binge Drinking \n     on Campus: Results of a National Study'', from Harvard School \n     of Public Health.\n       (C) The proportion of college students who drink varies \n     depending on where they live. Drinking rates are highest in \n     fraternities and sororities, followed by on-campus housing. \n     Students who live independently offsite (e.g., in apartments) \n     drink less, while commuting students who live with their \n     families drink the least.\n       (D) Institutions of higher education in places with strict \n     laws such as keg registration, prohibitions on happy hours, \n     and open container in public bans, which restrict the volume \n     of alcohol sold or consumed, displayed lower rates of \n     consumption and binge drinking among underage students.\n       (E) A 2000 report by the Department of Health and Human \n     Services, entitled ``Healthy People 2010'', observes that \n     ``The perception that alcohol use is socially acceptable \n     correlates with the fact that more than 80 percent of \n     American youth consume alcohol before their 21st birthday, \n     whereas the lack of social acceptance of other drugs \n     correlates with comparatively low rates of use. Similarly, \n     widespread societal expectations that young persons will \n     engage in binge drinking may encourage this highly dangerous \n     form of alcohol consumption.''.\n       (F) Mutually reinforcing interventions between the college \n     and surrounding community can change the broader environment \n     and help reduce alcohol abuse and alcohol-related problems \n     over the long term.\n       (5)(A) The use of illicit drugs threatens the lives and \n     well-being of students at institutions of higher education.\n       (B) According to the working paper, ``Alcohol and Marijuana \n     Use Among College Students: Economic Complements or \n     Substitutes'', for the National Bureau of Economic Research, \n     alcohol and marijuana are economic complements, meaning that \n     as the use of alcohol goes down on campuses, it is expected \n     that marijuana will as well, or that as marijuana usage \n     falls, so will alcohol usage.\n       (C) The annual prevalence of the use of an illicit drug at \n     institutions of higher education is 36 percent. The annual \n     marijuana use is 34 percent. The annual use of cocaine and \n     LSD is 4.8 percent. The annual use of heroin is 4.5 percent.\n\n     SEC. 3.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Across the United States, family, juvenile, and \n     domestic relations courts experience shortages of qualified \n     attorneys to represent the interests of men, women, and \n     children involved in their court systems.\n       (2) The Constitution of the United States provides that \n     everyone charged with a crime is entitled to adequate \n     counsel.\n       (3) In 1967, the Supreme Court held, for the first time, \n     that children were persons under the provisions of the 14th \n     amendment to the Constitution relating to due process, and \n     entitled to certain constitutional rights.\n       (4) In the case of In re Gault (387 U.S. 1), the Supreme \n     Court held that juveniles are entitled to notice of the \n     charges against them, legal counsel, questioning of \n     witnesses, and protection against self-incrimination in a \n     hearing that could result in commitment to an institution.\n       (5) Studies have indicated that many juveniles do not \n     receive the due process protections to which they are \n     entitled. More importantly, they frequently do not receive \n     effective assistance of legal counsel.\n       (6) Lawyers who represent juveniles often labor under \n     enormous caseloads with little training or support staff.\n\n[[Page S2484]]\n\n       (7) Public defenders who represent juveniles have, on \n     average, more than 500 cases per year, with more than 300 of \n     those cases being juvenile cases.\n       (8) Public defenders often lack specialized training in \n     representing juveniles. Approximately one-half of public \n     defender offices do not even have a section devoted to \n     juvenile delinquency practice in their office training \n     manuals.\n       (9) Due to relatively low wages, there is a nationwide \n     shortage of family law attorneys willing to represent \n     juveniles.\n       (10) The shortage of family law attorneys results in a \n     severe, disproportionate, and negative impact upon children, \n     impoverished parents, and victims of domestic violence.\n       (11) Children involved in family court cases are assigned \n     attorneys to protect their interests. Adults are entitled to \n     representation by attorneys. The lack of available \n     representation by family law attorneys causes children to \n     spend more time in foster care because cases are adjourned or \n     postponed due to lack of appropriate representation. Victims \n     of domestic violence seeking protection from their abusers \n     often will remain in the abusive situation, choose to \n     represent themselves, or wait until an attorney becomes \n     available, all of which risk their personal safety.\n       (12) In 1995, 3,100,000 children were reported to child \n     protection agencies as being abused or neglected, which is \n     about double the number reported in 1984. Of these, 996,000 \n     children were confirmed after investigation to be abused or \n     neglected. A 1996 study by the Department of Health and Human \n     Services found that the number of children seriously injured \n     nearly quadrupled between 1986 and 1993 from 141,700 to \n     565,000.\n       (13) As of 1995 year-end, about 494,000 children were in \n     foster care, a considerable rise from the estimated 280,000 \n     children in foster care at the end of 1986. Most of these \n     children are in foster care because of abuse, neglect, or \n     abandonment by their parents. Many are also placed in foster \n     care due to a court order during a child protection case.\n       (14) Some estimates suggest that in 70 percent of homes \n     where there is domestic violence, there is also child abuse.\n       (15) Children who witness domestic violence can also \n     develop posttraumatic stress disorder, low self-esteem, \n     anxiety, depression, eating disorders, and destructive \n     behavior that can last through adulthood, limiting an \n     individual's ability to achieve academically, socially, and \n     on the job. However, early intervention and education can \n     help prevent further danger to children.\n       (16) Continued adjournment forces victims to repeatedly \n     confront their abusers in court. This not only increases the \n     risk of retribution, but also the chance that the victim will \n     abandon the process because of the burden.\n       (17) Between 1984 and 1994 there was a 65 percent increase \n     in domestic relations cases and a 59 percent increase in the \n     number of juvenile cases.\n       (18) The caseload for child abuse in New York State alone \n     has increased by more than 300 percent between 1984 and 1988.\n       (19) Judges in Chicago hear on average 1,700 delinquency \n     cases per month, and in Los Angeles judges for juvenile cases \n     have about 10 minutes to devote to each case.\n\n     SEC. 2.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) An estimated 2,000,000 new teachers will be needed over \n     the next decade.\n       (2) Under the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, States must \n     recruit highly qualified teachers by 2006, yet schools in \n     rural areas and high poverty schools have trouble attracting \n     and retaining such teachers.\n       (3) A 2000 study by the Education Trust reports that high \n     poverty schools are twice as likely not to have teachers \n     certified in the fields in which they teach as schools that \n     are not high poverty schools, which highlights that high \n     poverty schools will need special help to meet the goals of \n     the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001.\n       (4) If the Nation is to improve student achievement and \n     success in school, the United States must encourage and \n     support the training and development of our Nation's \n     teachers, who are the single most important in-school \n     influence on student learning.\n       (5) A majority of graduates of schools of education believe \n     that traditional teacher preparation programs left them ill \n     prepared for the challenges and rigors of the classroom.\n       (6) Fewer than 36 percent of new teachers feel very well \n     prepared to implement curriculum and performance standards.\n       (7) Highly qualified teachers are more effective in \n     impacting student academic achievement because such teachers \n     have high verbal abilities, high content knowledge, and an \n     enhanced ability to know how to teach the content using \n     appropriate pedagogical strategies.\n       (8) The difference in annual student achievement growth \n     between having an effective and ineffective teacher can be \n     more than 1 grade level of achievement in academic \n     performance.\n       (9) Studies have consistently documented the important \n     connection between a teacher's verbal and cognitive abilities \n     and student achievement.\n       (10) Research has shown that there is a positive effect on \n     student achievement when students are taught by teachers with \n     a strong subject-matter background.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to provide \n     grants to teacher preparation programs to better prepare \n     teachers to educate all children.\n\n     SEC. 3.

AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There is authorized to be appropriated to carry out this \n     Act $200,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2004 through 2009.\n\n                                 S. 409\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Approximately 3,000,000 reports of child abuse and \n     neglect must be investigated each year.\n       (2) Approximately 1,000,000 of these reports are confirmed \n     and require ongoing intervention.\n       (3) On any given day in the United States, more than \n     500,000 children are being served outside their homes by the \n     child welfare system.\n       (4) These children are served in more than 150,000 foster \n     homes and more than 5,000 residential programs.\n       (5) The child welfare workforce crisis has developed as the \n     result of the following 3 major factors:\n       (A) Overall low levels of unemployment and the resulting \n     increase in competition for workers in all sectors of the \n     economy.\n       (B) The increasing numbers of children and families needing \n     service coupled with the decreasing numbers of workers in the \n     employment pool.\n       (C) The relatively low pay and difficult working conditions \n     that exist in many child welfare agencies.\n       (6) The vacancy rate in State child welfare agencies is 8.1 \n     percent, and 14.3 percent for private agencies.\n       (7) The overall turnover rate in child welfare agencies has \n     doubled since 1991, to 13.9 percent in public agencies and to \n     46.5 percent in private agencies.\n       (8) The child welfare workforce crisis is real and is \n     already compromising the ability of the child welfare system \n     to effectively provide essential services to its children and \n     families. In addition, analysis of trends indicates that the \n     situation will worsen over the next decade. It is clear that \n     steps must be taken now to encourage more workers to enter \n     the child welfare services field and to improve the salaries, \n     working conditions, and training of workers who provide these \n     critically important services.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to establish the Homeland Intelligence Agency, and for \nother purposes; to the Select Committee on Intelligence.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I have previously given a statement and a \nspeech on the floor of the Senate with regard to Mr. Estrada's \nnomination. I voted against him in the Judiciary Committee. The \nconcerns I had included his not answering questions that were put to \nhim, serious questions, in my judgment--issues about his record and his \ntemperament.\n  Today, I wish to talk about homeland security. First, I will talk \nabout the serious shortcomings in the administration's response, and \nthen I will talk about six bills I have introduced in this Congress to \nimprove our homeland security, including a bill today to overhaul the \nway we do intelligence work here at home.\n  The first responsibility of any government is to protect its people. \nYet we live in a time when Americans feel extraordinary insecurity. We \nare at an elevated level of threat warning. The CIA Director says al-\nQaida is ``resuming the offensive.'' The FBI Director says there are \n``al-Qaida cells in the United States that we have not yet been able to \nidentify.''\n  In other words, al-Qaida cells are operating here, but we do not know \nwho they are, where they are, or what they are doing.\n  Americans are buying plastic sheeting and duct tape in record \namounts. While they are doing everything they can to protect \nthemselves, they have a right to know that those of us in Government \nare doing everything we can to protect them, their homes, their \nfamilies, and their children. This is a dangerous time.\n  But a dangerous time calls for an honest response: This President is \nfailing the test on homeland security. Homeland security has yielded to \nchemical companies that are holding back commonsense steps to secure \nchemical plants against horrific explosions. Homeland security is \nyielding to bureaucratic inertia that is defending old and outworn ways \nof fighting terror.\n  Today there are huge holes in our borders--one guard for every 5 \nmiles on the Canadian border. There are huge holes at our ports--we are \nstill inspecting only a fraction of all shipments into the United \nStates, shipments that could carry nuclear or biological weapons. There \nare huge holes in our hometowns--where cops and firefighters do not \nhave the equipment or the training that they need.\n  For all these holes, this President has vetoed billions for homeland \nsecurity, he is withholding funds that first responders need today, and \nhe has proposed funding homeland security this year at a level that \neven Republican experts like Warren Rudman say is totally inadequate.\n  We cannot cover the holes in our borders with plastic sheeting. Our \ncops and firefighters need reinforcements and new gear, not canned \ngoods.\n  In 2000, the President's team talked about the dangers of a hollow \nmilitary. At a time when the greatest dangers we face are here at home, \nthis administration risks creating a hollow homeland defense.\n  This is happening for a very simple reason. The bare minimum of \nhomeland security improvements we need--$10 billion more this year--\ncosts less than half of President Bush's tax cut just for 226,000 \nmillionaires.\n  I believe it is time to say to this President: Mr. President, please \nput our security first. Please set aside $20 billion in tax breaks for \n226,000 millionaires, and put homeland security for 290 million \nAmericans first.\n  Let me talk a little bit about my work on homeland security since \nCongress came back into session. Back in December, I laid out a \ncomprehensive plan for strengthening our domestic security, from \nstopping ID fraud to sharing more information with local police to \nimproving our cybersecurity. And in the 6 weeks Congress has been in \nsession so far, I have introduced six bills to strengthen our homeland \nsecurity. Each of these bills would make a concrete, tangible \ndifference in people's lives.\n  Two bills are focused on empowering people to play a greater role in \nhomeland security.\n  First, until this week, most Americans have no better idea how to \nrespond to a terrorist attack than on September 11. Now the \nadministration has begun giving out useful information, but we still \ndon't have enough. We are not being told, for example, how to respond \nto chemical or biological attacks. In addition, there is still a \nserious question whether people will get the information they need when \nthey need it, particularly when they are sleeping. Obviously TV and \nradio won't help if you are asleep. So I have a bill, which I wrote \nwith Senator Fritz Hollings, that will create an emergency warning \nsystem to reach everyone--for example, using special phone rings that \ncould wake people up in the middle of the night.\n  Second, we want to encourage more people to contribute. People want \nto serve, but they feel like they haven't been asked. We should ask. \nOne way is through the Neighborhood Watch program. Neighborhood Watches \nhelp prevent both terrorism and ordinary crime. We are going to \nincrease support for these, encourage folks to get involved, with the \ngoal--the realistic goal--of tripling the number of neighborhood \nwatches.\n  Next, I have introduced two bills focused on hardening vulnerable \ntargets--in other words, taking those targets we know terrorists want \nto attack, and transforming them so they will be less vulnerable.\n  One bill is to do research to enhance building security, to improve \nthe quality of private security guards and make buildings more \nresistant to attack. We know that at the Oklahoma City bombing, 85 \npercent of the lives might have been saved if the building had been \nbuilt with better materials, in a better way. We are still learning \nabout the World Trade Center collapse. We know we need better \nconstruction and better security around buildings across America.\n  A fourth bill would require the Government to improve its \ncybersecurity. A few weeks ago, we had an attack that crippled a lot of \nGovernment computer systems. There are simple tests we could be doing \nto block computer attacks that we are not doing: to ``patch'' holes in \nthe systems. We need to make that happen.\n  Fifth, I have introduced a bill to help local law enforcement by \nrequiring the Government to give security clearances to more police \nofficers, firefighters, and health officials. They need information to \nkeep us safe, but too often they are not getting it. This bill would \nhelp make sure they do.\n  Finally, there is the bill I have introduced today, and that I want \nto talk about in some detail. This bill will make fundamental changes \nin the way\n\n[[Page S2488]]\n\nwe protect Americans against international terrorists operating within \nour borders. This bill takes away from the FBI the responsibility to \ncollect intelligence on foreign terrorist groups operating in America. \nAnd this bill gives that responsibility to a new Homeland Intelligence \nAgency. I believe this agency will do a better job protecting our \nsafety and our basic freedoms. Let me briefly explain why.\n  There is no question that the FBI is full of dedicated professionals \nwho are patriots, who serve their country with courage and conviction, \nwho do all of us proud.\n  But there is also no question that the FBI made many serious mistakes \nbefore September 11. There was the Phoenix memorandum, a memorandum \nabout suspicious behavior at flight schools that the FBI did not follow \nup on. There was the Moussaoui case, where the FBI had in its \npossession a computer full of critical information, yet did not access \nthe information there. There were even two hijackers who the FBI knew \nwere threats but did not track and stop.\n  It is true all this was before September 11. The other day, Director \nMueller told me that my criticisms understated the extent of the FBI's \nreforms. Well, I respect Director Mueller, and I look forward to \ncontinuing to talk with him about FBI reform. I have only the best \nwishes for his reform efforts.\n  At the same time, it would be hard to understate the seriousness of \nthe problems we have seen.\n  This is not just my view; it is the view of every objective panel to \nlook at this issue. These panels have raised serious questions about \nthe FBI's response to terrorism, and in some instances, about the FBI's \ncapacity to respond to terrorism.\n  The Markle Task Force commented: ``. . . there is a resistance \ningrained in the FBI ranks to sharing counter-terrorism information . . \n. the FBI has not prioritized intelligence analysis in the areas of \ncounter-terrorism.''\n  The Joint Congressional Inquiry noted: The FBI has a ``history of \nrepeated shortcomings within its current responsibility for domestic \nintelligence. . . .''\n  The Brookings Institution went further, stating that ``there are \nstrong reasons to question whether the FBI is the right agency to \nconduct domestic intelligence collection and analysis.''\n  And finally, the Gilmore Commission recently said: ``the Bureau's \nlong standing tradition and organizational culture persuade us that, \neven with the best of intentions, the FBI cannot soon be made over into \nan organization dedicated to detecting and preventing attacks rather \nthan one dedicated to punishing them.''\n  I believe the Gilmore Commission reached the right conclusion.\n  Part of the problem is bureaucratic resistance at the FBI. The FBI is \nfull of superb public servants. But the reality is that the FBI is also \na bureaucracy, and it is the nature of a bureaucracy to resist change. \nThat is just the reality. It was only in November that the New York \nTimes reported the FBI's No. 2 official was ``amazed and astounded'' by \nthe FBI's sluggish response to the terrorist threat.\n  Beyond the problem of bureaucratic resistance, there is a more \nfundamental problem with the FBI. That problem is the conflict at the \nbase of the FBI's mission, which is a conflict between law enforcement \nand intelligence. These are fundamentally different functions.\n  Law enforcement is about building criminal cases and putting people \nin jail. Intelligence isn't about building a case; it is about \ngathering information and putting it together into a bigger picture.\n  The FBI has never been built for intelligence. It has always been an \nagency that hires people who want to be law enforcement officers, \ntrains them to be law enforcement officers, and promotes them for \nsucceeding as law enforcement officers.\n  Cases have been run by field offices with little of the central \ncoordination that is essential to combat national networks of \nterrorists. The FBI has regularly kept intelligence within the agency's \nwalls rather than sharing it with other key players.\n  Now, the FBI says all this is changing. But with all due respect, the \nFBI's reforms are too little and too late. They are not enough, and \nbecause of the nature of the FBI, they cannot ever be enough.\n  That is why I propose today to create a Homeland Intelligence Agency, \none that would be responsible for collecting foreign intelligence \ninside the United States, analyzing that intelligence, and getting it \nto the policymakers or first responders who need it. This entity isn't \nin the new Department of Homeland Security. It isn't in the newly \nannounced ``Terrorist Threat Integration Center.'' That's just about \nanalysis. This is about collection, gathering the intelligence \ninformation to begin with.\n  I believe this agency will do a better job fighting terrorism because \nits sole focus will be intelligence gathering. The inherent conflict \nbetween law enforcement and intelligence will not get in the way of its \nwork.\n  I also believe it will do a better job protecting our civil \nliberties. While we will not give the new agency any new authorities, \nwe will place new checks on its ability to collect information about \ninnocent people. Time and again, we have seen this administration \noverreach when it comes to civil liberties. That should stop, and this \nproposal will help stop it.\n  We will require judicial approval before the most secretive and \ninvasive investigations of religious and political groups. We will \nrequire greater public reporting and more internal auditing. We will \nestablish a new and independent office of civil liberties within the \nnew agency that is dedicated to protecting the constitutional rights of \ninnocent Americans. So at the end of the day, we will help to fulfill \nAmerica's promise--that we are safe and free at the same time.\n  I believe this bill is an important step to making America safer, and \nI look forward to working on it with colleagues on both sides of the \naisle in getting this legislation passed.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN:\n  S. 411. A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to establish a \nuniversity transportation center to be known as the ``Southwest Bridge \nResearch Center''; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I rise to introduce legislation that I \nbelieve will go a long way in helping to improve the safety and \ndurability of the Nation's highway bridges. Today, with great pleasure \nI am introducing the Southwest Bridge Research Center Establishment Act \nof 2003.\n  The purpose of this bill is to authorize the Secretary of \nTransportation to establish a new University Transportation Center \nfocused on the safety of highway bridges. The new Southwest Bridge \nResearch Center is a cooperative effort between New Mexico State \nUniversity and the Oklahoma Transportation Center, comprising the \nUniversity of Oklahoma and Oklahoma State University. The new center \nwill lead the Nation in the research and development of technologies \nfor bridge testing and monitoring, procedures for ensuring bridge \nsafety and security, and training in methods of bridge inspection.\n  Our highway network is a central component of our economy and \nfundamental to our freedom and quality of life. America's mobility is \nthe engine of our free market system. Transportation via cars, buses, \nand trucks plays a central role in our basic quality of life. Much of \nthe food we eat, the clothes we wear, the materials for our homes and \noffices, comes to us over the 4 million miles of our road network.\n  One critical element of our highway network is the highway bridges \nthat span streams, rivers, and canyons of our cities and rural areas. \nBridges also help traffic flow smoothly by carrying one road over \nanother.\n  Most highway bridges are easy to overlook. Notable exceptions are New \nEngland's covered bridges, the well-known Golden Gate Bridge, and the \nspectacular Rio Grande Gorge Bridge near Taos, New Mexico. The fact is, \naccording to the Federal Highway Administration, we have about 590,000 \nhighway bridges in this country that are more than 20-feet long. The \ntotal bridge-deck area of these 590,000 bridges is an amazing 120 \nsquare miles, or slightly smaller in area than the entire city limits \nof Albuquerque, New Mexico, roughly twice the size of the entire \nDistrict of Columbia, or five times the area of New York's Manhattan \nIsland. The State of Texas leads\n\n[[Page S2489]]\n\nthe Nation with over 48,000 bridges, about ten percent of the total. \nOhio is second with about 28,000 highway bridges.\n  A little known, and disturbing fact about these 590,000 highway \nbridges is that nearly 84,000, or 14 percent, are considered to be \nstructurally deficient according to the most recent statistics from the \nFHWA. The percent of structurally deficient bridges varies widely among \nthe 50 States. For example, this chart shows some of the States with \nsome of the highest percentage of deficient bridges.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                             Percent of\n                                                Number of   structurally\n             State                Number of   structurally    deficient\n                                   bridges      deficient   bridges  (in\n                                                 bridges      percent)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOklahoma                              22,708         7,605          33.5\nMissouri                              23,604         6,083          25.8\nRhode Island                             749           187          25.0\nPennsylvania                          22,092         5,418          24.5\nSouth Dakota                           6,001         1,398          23.3\nMississippi                           16,825         3,694          22.0\nIowa                                  25,030         5,036          20.1\nNorth Dakota                           4,517           871          19.3\nMichigan                              10,631         2,012          18.9\nLouisiana                             13,426         2,425          18.1\nAlabama                               15,641         2,677          17.1\nNorth Carolina                        16,991         2,513          14.8\nKansas                                25,638         3,465          13.5\nOhio                                  27,952         3,304         11.8\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n Source: FHWA National Bridge Inventory (NBI) System, December 2001.\n\n  Structurally deficient bridges are a particular concern in rural \nareas of our country. According to FHWA's 2002 edition of its \nConditions and Performance Report to Congress, 16 percent of rural \nbridges are structurally deficient compared to only 10 percent of urban \nbridges. The report estimates the average cost required to maintain the \nexisting 590,000 highway bridges is $7.3 billion per year.\n  Another surprising fact about our Nation's highway bridges is their \nage. About one-third of all highway bridges are more than 50 years old, \nand an amazing 10,000 bridges are at least 100 years old. About 4,000 \nof these century-old bridges are currently rated as structurally \ndeficient.\n  I do believe the number of deficient bridges in this country should \nbe a concern to all Senators. Ensuring that States and local \ncommunities have the funds they need to help correct these deficient \nbridges will be one of my priorities when Congress reauthorizes TEA-21. \nHowever, because there may not be sufficient Federal and State funding \nto address all of the deficient bridges, it will be important to \nidentify the bridges that are most in need of replacement or \nrehabilitation.\n  To ensure the most efficient use of limited resources, Congress \nshould also address the need for new technologies to help States \nmonitor the condition of the Nation's 590,000 highway bridges and \ndetermine priorities for repair or replacement. Such monitoring \ntechnologies, or ``smart bridges,'' should be quick, efficient, and not \ndamage the bridge in any way. I am very pleased that New Mexico State \nUniversity is one of the Nation's pioneers in the development of non-\ndestructive methods of determining the physical condition of highway \nbridges. Such smart bridges can record and transmit information on \ntheir current structural condition as well as on the traffic crossing \nthem.\n  In 1998, NMSU installed 67 fiber-optic sensors on an existing steel \nbridge on Interstate 10 in Las Cruces. This award-winning project was \nthe first application of fiber-optic sensors to highway bridges. More \nrecently, in 2000, sensors were incorporated directly in a concrete \nbridge during construction to monitor the curing of the concrete; the \nbridge crosses the Rio Puerco on Interstate 40, west of Albuquerque. \nNMSU has an actual 40-foot ``bridge'' in a laboratory on campus to \nallow studies of instrumentation and data collection.\n  I ask unanimous consent that two articles describing NMSU's \naccomplishments on smart bridge technology be printed in the Record, \nexhibits one and two.\n  NMSU is also a leader in other areas of bridge inspection. It has \nprovided training for bridge inspectors for over 30 years. It has also \ndeveloped expertise in using a virtual reality approach to document a \nbridge's physical condition.\n  At the same time, Oklahoma State University leads the Nation in the \ndevelopment of the Geothermal Smart Bridge System, which uses energy \nstored in the earth itself to help keep bridges free of ice and snow. \nOSU is also performing cutting edge research on high-performance \nstructural materials frequently used in bridges including concrete, \nsteel, and timber.\n  At the University of Oklahoma, a multidisciplinary team of \nresearchers is working to develop a ``smart'' vehicle-bridge system \nthat is expected to reduce the impact of moving trucks on bridge \nstructures, thereby increasing the lifespan of highway bridges. The UO \nteam is also expert in the development of high-performance concrete and \nof sensors for non-destructive testing.\n  Of course, the Oklahoma Transportation Center was also heavily \ninvolved last year in the rebuilding of the Interstate 40 bridge over \nthe Arkansas River near Webbers Falls, OK, after it collapsed when \nstruck by a barge. The bridge was reopened to traffic only 64 days \nafter the accident.\n  This is just a glimpse at the high quality bridge research at these \nthree universities. All three institutions are widely recognized as \nnational leaders in all aspects of bridge research and technology. I \nbelieve it is fully appropriate for these three nationally recognized \nuniversities to collaborate in operating the Southwest Bridge Research \nCenter.\n  The bill I am introducing today authorizes the Secretary of \nTransportation to establish and operate the Southwest Bridge Research \nCenter at New Mexico State University in collaboration with the \nOklahoma Transportation Center. I do believe the three universities \nhave earned this honor. In fact, in some ways, Congress has already \nrecognized their fine work of the three centers. For example, the \nUniversity of Oklahoma was allotted $3.5 million in TEA-21 for research \nwork on intelligent stiffeners for bridge stress reduction and Oklahoma \nState received $3.5 million for work on the geothermal heat pump smart \nbridge program.\n  I am pleased to have also played a part. At my request, Congress \nprovided $600,000 in 2001 for bridge research at New Mexico State \nUniversity and an additional $250,000 in the current fiscal year.\n  The specific purpose of the Southwest Bridge Research Center will be \nto contribute to improving the performance of the nation's highway \nbridges. The center will emphasize five goals: 1. Increasing the number \nof skilled individuals entering the field of transportation; 2. \nimproving the monitoring of the structural health of highway bridges; \n3. developing innovative technologies for testing and assessment of \nbridges; 4. developing technologies and procedures for ensuring bridge \nsafety, reliability, and security; and 5. providing training in the \nmethods of bridge inspection and evaluation.\n  Building on the three universities' research work, the Southwest \nBridge Research Center will develop a strong educational component, \nincluding degree opportunities in bridge engineering at both the \nundergraduate and graduate levels. In addition, the center will have a \ncooperative certificate program for training and professional \ndevelopment. Distance education technology and computer-based learning \nwill allow programs to be offered at any of the universities.\n  The bill provides $3 million in funding from the Highway Trust Fund \nto operate the center.\n  New Mexico State University and the Oklahoma Transportation Center \nhave applied their vast talents, tools, and techniques to solving \ntechnological problems with highway bridges for over 30 years. The team \nis well established and maintains cutting-edge expertise. The members \nof the team are recognized and respected at the national and \ninternational levels through accomplishments in bridge testing, \nmonitoring, and evaluation.\n  I ask all senators to support the designation of a new Southwest \nBridge Research Center. I look forward to working this year with the \nChairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, Senator Inhofe, \nand Senator Jeffords, the ranking member, to incorporate this bill into \nthe full 6-year reauthorization of the transportation bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter of support from the three \nuniversities and a letter from Rhonda Faught, the Secretary of New \nMexico's State Highway and Transportation Department be printed in the \nRecord. I also ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S2490]]\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 18, 1998]\n\n         Sensors Bridge Gap in Communication About Repair Needs\n\n                          (By Louis Jacobson)\n\n       Las Cruces, NM.--Hardly anyone in this burgeoning \n     southwestern city realizes it, but right behind the Las \n     Cruces Days Inn is a state-of-the-art experimental bridge. It \n     isn't very exciting to look at--in fact, a motorist whizzing \n     under Interstate 10 probably wouldn't notice anything \n     unusual. But the experiment's sponsors--including the Federal \n     Highway Administration, the National Science Foundation and \n     state highway departments--hope that it will eventually \n     revolutionize the way the Untied States maintains its half-\n     million aging highway bridges.\n       Undergirding the Las Cruces ``smart bridge'' is a series of \n     special sensors. It's not unusual for a bridge to be strung \n     with mechanical sensors to measure structural stresses, \n     particularly when a bridge is older and at higher risk of \n     long-term fatigue. But the Las Cruces sensors are embedded in \n     fiber-optic cables that--once the experiment is fully \n     underway--will be able to transmit their readings to bridge \n     officials in real time. In other words, weary bridges will \n     soon be able to telephone their weakened conditions directly \n     to the highway authorities so that bridge engineers can be \n     dispatched to head off catastrophe.\n       ``We're looking at a very large bridge stock in the U.S. \n     that's in need of maintenance,'' says Rola Idriss, the civil \n     engineer at New Mexico State University who is monitoring the \n     I-10 experiment. ``Our idea was, how can we better inspect \n     our bridges, how can we better evaluate them and how can we \n     save money and time? The basic idea was to monitor them from \n     far away.''\n       The fiber-optic cables used in the experiment were designed \n     by the Naval Research Laboratory. First, laser beams etch the \n     cables' cores with five-millimeter-long internal gauges, \n     spaced about two to three meters apart. Once the cable is \n     strung under the bridge and attached with epoxy, engineers \n     program the system so that light beams careen down the cable \n     at regular intervals. The degree of the light beams' bend \n     directly correlates with the degree of bridge stress. If the \n     results exceed a pre-calibrated bench mark, officials will be \n     alerted to check for weakness exactly where they need to. The \n     gauges can also be used to report general traffic patters, \n     aiding transportation planners as well as bridge inspectors.\n       So far, the fiber-optic gauges have remained fastened \n     better than normal wire gauges have, Idriss says. More \n     important, the fiber simultaneously serves as a data \n     collector and transmitter. ``It was a very elegant way to get \n     away from the traditional method of using wires and \n     installation,'' Idriss says. ``You just hook it to a computer \n     and then let it cell phone the information home. The beauty \n     of it is that you don't have to be on the bridge. I could \n     monitor a bridge in Washington if I wanted to.''\n       Though the bridge in Las Cruces--which Idriss describes as \n     an ordinary interstate bridge--was built in the 1970s, it has \n     already displayed some metal fatigue (a fact that was known \n     even before the smart bridge experiment was concocted). \n     ``It's not unusual to have that kind of fatigue, but the \n     bridge is not very old, so you want to know much more about \n     what's happening,'' she says. ``Now, we need to expand the \n     capability of the system by collecting from many more \n     sensors. It currently has 30, but we'd like to double that at \n     least.''\n       Idriss--who grew up in a family of engineers in Beirut and \n     later became the first woman to earn a civil engineering PhD \n     from New Mexico State--acknowledges that both technical and \n     economic challenges remain. Her sensors cost about $50 to \n     $100 each, including the cost of the cable itself. The \n     benefits, she says, would come from freeing bridge inspectors \n     from many of their routine and time-consuming duties. At the \n     same time, highway departments could use their new data to \n     repair bridges more precisely and cost-efficiently than \n     today's information sources allow. ``If a fiber-optic gauge \n     system costs $30,000,'' she says, ``that's still far less \n     than a typical new bridge, which costs millions.''\n       Even if that price tag eventually drops, highway officials \n     who aren't involved in the experiment suggest that the system \n     will be most appropriate for the minority of bridges that \n     officials already fret about.\n       ``It seems like this system would be best for bridges that \n     need special attention,'' says David Hensing, deputy \n     executive director of the American Association of State \n     Highway and Transportation Officials. ``It's probably more \n     expensive than is necessary for 90 percent of America's \n     bridges. But for the other 5 or 10 percent, that kind of \n     instrumentation will get more years of life out of the bridge \n     and lead to more timely corrective action.''\n       Bob Reilly, director of cooperative research programs at \n     the federal Transportation Research Board, which is part of \n     the National Research Council, concurs. ``I could image it \n     would be a very useful thing in rare cases, but my guess is \n     that it's not worth it for all bridges,'' he says.\n       Richard Livingston, the Federal Highway Administration \n     official who is supplying Idriss with equipment and grant \n     money, suggests three types of bridges that are likeliest to \n     benefit: bridges that are already thought to be structurally \n     deficient, critical urban bridges that carry economically \n     vital traffic flows and newer bridge designs with which \n     engineers have little long-term experience.\n       California transportation officials have expressed interest \n     in installing fiber-optic gauges in critical seismic zones. \n     Closer to home, the Washington area's Woodrow Wilson Bridge--\n     a clogged and vital drawbridge on the Capital Beltway--could \n     be among the first to serve as a test site, if Congress \n     authorizes funding to do so.\n       ``It would be able to help us schedule maintenance \n     activities in a more cost-effective way,'' says Louis \n     Triandafilou, a Baltimore-based Federal Highway \n     Administration official who has been trying to broker the \n     Wilson Bridge deal. ``The Wilson Bridge is a good one to test \n     because it's a drawbridge and because it has a very high \n     traffic count, especially truck traffic, so you can get \n     information on how the bridge is affected by fatigue and \n     repetitive stress.''\n       Given that it often takes four or five professionals a full \n     week to inspect just one bridge--and considering the big \n     back-log of bridges to inspect, including some whose crucial \n     parts aren't easy to reach--the experiment's advocates say \n     that the benefits of remote sensing can be substantial. ``The \n     real problem is that no one has ever done a cost-benefit \n     analysis,'' Livington says. ``It has increased cost, but it \n     may also have increased benefits.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n           [From the Public Roads magazine, Nov./Dec., 2002]\n\n                        A Decade of Achievement\n\n     (By Richard A. Livingston, Milton Mills, and Morton S. Oskard)\n\n       Installation of sensor systems in bridges is increasingly \n     recognized as important for obtaining information on strains, \n     temperature, moisture, and other variables. The information \n     collected from such smart bridges can be used to confirm \n     design calculations, detect damage, and count traffic, among \n     other functions.\n       An example of the sensor systems developed by the Advanced \n     Research program is the fiber-optic strain gauge based on \n     Bragg gratings. These gratings consist of alternating zones \n     of different indexes of refraction. The spacing of the layers \n     determines a specific wavelength of light that will be \n     reflected. The technology is the same as that used in the \n     broadband fiber-optic telecommunications systems now being \n     installed across the country.\n       Since the fiber-optic sensor operates with light waves \n     rather than electrons, it has several advantages over \n     conventional electronic strain gauges: ruggedness, absence of \n     drift, and immunity to electromagnetic noise. It permits as \n     many as 100 gauges to be put on a single fiber as thin as a \n     human hair. The installation of the gauges is simplified, the \n     cabling requirement is reduced, and the cost-per-sensor is \n     lowered.\n       Possible applications may require networks on the order of \n     1,000 sensors, or 1 kilosensor. Working under an interagency \n     agreement with the Naval Research Laboratory, which has \n     developed many fiber-optic sensors, the Advanced Research \n     program has demonstrated several applications of sensor \n     networks for structural monitoring.\n       The first application, co-funded with the National Science \n     Foundation (NSF), resulted in the installation of a system of \n     67 calibrated fiber-optic sensors on an existing steel bridge \n     on Interstate 10 in Las Cruces, NM. This work was carried \n     out by New Mexico State University, with Dr. Rola Idriss \n     as the principal investigator.\n       ``The research has shown the fiber-optic sensors to be a \n     powerful nondestructive evaluation tool,'' says Idriss. \n     ``Whether retrofitted to an existing structure or built into \n     a new smart bridge, they can yield a wealth of information \n     about the structure and the traffic crossing it.''\n       The installation has generated several types of information \n     under random traffic loading, including girder deflections, \n     fundamental vibration frequencies, vehicle speed data, and \n     traffic flow on an hourly basis. To date, the Las Cruces \n     project has achieved notable success in its primary purpose \n     of investigating practical issues in the full-scale \n     application and regular operation of fiber-optic sensors on \n     highway structures. The project has been widely covered in \n     the media and received several awards.\n       New Mexico State University applied the sensors to the \n     construction of a new concrete bridge in a project co-funded \n     by Advanced Research, NSF, and the New Mexico State Highway \n     and Transportation Department (NMSHTD). The mix design and \n     curing conditions now being used to make high-performance \n     concrete structures may produce unexpectedly high \n     temperatures and stresses during the casting of girders, \n     possibly leading to cracking and major structural failure. \n     Obtaining information on the internal conditions is difficult \n     with conventional temperature or strain gauges because of \n     their fragility.\n       Forty fiber-optic long-gauge deformation and temperature \n     sensors were embedded in the concrete girders of the Rio \n     Puerco Bridge during casting. These sensors monitored the \n     prestress forces applied to the steel strands in the precast \n     concrete components during and after the steam curing period. \n     One finding was that some design codes considerably \n     overestimate the actual losses. NMSHTD now is planning to use \n     sensors routinely in the construction of concrete bridges in \n     the future. ``Building the sensors into new bridges,'' says \n     Idriss, ``enables us to evaluate new high-performance \n     materials and new designs. It also establishes a baseline for \n     long-term monitoring.''\n\n[[Page S2491]]\n\n       Several companies now offer Bragg fiber-optic sensor \n     systems on a commercial basis. Two States (Hawaii and New \n     Mexico) have received funding from the FHWA Innovative Bridge \n     Research and Construction Program. In addition, several other \n     States are considering installation of these systems on new \n     or existing bridges. Fiber-optic systems also have been \n     chosen as the method for measuring expansion in concrete \n     girders under the lithium treatment evaluation program. All \n     these developments indicate that fiber-optic sensor systems \n     have been transferred successfully from Advanced Research to \n     other FHWA programs.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           College of Engineering,\n\n\n              Office of the Dean, New Mexico State University,\n\n                                  Las Cruces, NM, January 8, 2003.\n     Hon.

Mr. NICKLES:\n  S. 413. A bill to provide for the fair and efficient judicial \nconsideration of personal injury and wrongful death claims arising out \nof asbestos exposure, to ensure that individuals who suffer harm, now \nor in the future, from illnesses caused by exposure to asbestos receive \ncompensation for their injuries, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill and to \nspeak about a litigation crisis affecting both the overall well-being \nof our nation and our ability to stimulate economic recovery. I'm \nspeaking of the out-of-control explosion of asbestos litigation.\n  Asbestos litigation has become a disease in our economy. It threatens \nto drive scores of companies into bankruptcy. It discourages investment \nin companies under suit. It drives stock value down. It diverts funds \naway from expansion and growth. It results in job loss and, in short, \nit has become an obstacle to economic recovery.\n  The cost of asbestos litigation and burden on business has been \ndevastating. Over 8,400 companies have been named as defendants in \nsuits. At least $54 billion has been paid on more than 6000,000 claims. \nU.S. Insurers have paid over $22 billion. Insurers outside U.S. have \npaid $8-12. Defendant companies have already expended between $20-24 \nbillion in claims and transaction costs associated with asbestos \nlitigation.\n  The total cost of asbestos litigation could reach between $200-265 \nbillion. This is revenue not invested in the economy, not invested in \nnew jobs.\n  Some companies are hit with multiple suits involving thousands of \nplaintiffs. The weight of claims and settlements has resulted in an \nalarming increase in Chapter 11 bankruptcies. Over sixty companies have\n\n[[Page S2493]]\n\nfiled Chapter 11 bankruptcy due to asbestos claims. This trend toward \nbankruptcy has had an alarming domino effect. As companies declare \nChapter 11 reorganization, the litigation burden shifts to other \ndefendant companies only encouraging them to declare bankruptcy as \nwell.\n  At least 5 major companies have each spent more than $1 billion. \nThirty-eight of the nations top 100 contractors to the DoD are now \nasbestos defendants. This crisis threatens to impact our national \nsecurity industry at the worst possible time in our history. But it \nalso prevents us from aggressively stimulating the economy. The bottom-\nline is: the cost of litigation and/or bankruptcy siphons away critical \nbusiness revenue needed for growth and the creation of new jobs. What \nis frightening, is that only about half the number of potential \nclaimants have come forward thus far. If left unchecked, we have only \nseen the tip of this crisis.\n\n  It's not only business that suffers. Employees of defendant companies \nsuffer a great deal from a damaging ripple effect. The Rand Institute \nof Civil Justice estimates that 100,000 jobs were not created as a \nresult of asbestos litigation. Bankruptcies related to asbestos \nlitigation have led to 52,000-60,000 people losing their jobs, \naccording to a SEBAGO study. It is estimated that each displaced worker \nwill lose, on average, $25,000-$50,000 in wages before finding a job, \nor in reduced salary following finding a new job.\n  It does not stop there. Approximately 42 percent of displaced \nmanufacturing workers participate in retraining programs, costing about \n$2,000-$3,000 per worker. Local communities also bear the brunt of job \nreductions due to asbestos-related lay-offs. It is estimated that there \nhave been between $.6 and $2.1 billion in additional indirect local \ncosts and loss. On average, there are eight additional jobs lost \nlocally for every initial job lost. Additional multiplier effects \ninclude lowered property values, population decline and lost Federal \nand State tax revenue.\n  Those employees fortunate enough not to lose their jobs in asbestos-\nrelated cut-backs, also suffer due to the weakened position of their \nemployer. Studies show that reduced stock value in defendant companies \nresults in a 25 percent reduction in employees' 401(k) plan value. The \naverage worker loses, on average $8,300 in pension devaluation.\n  This is a situation that has been exploited by the non-injured. Over \n65 percent of plaintiffs, estimates as high as 90 percent, have no \nmedical injury, but have filed suit on the basis that they ``may'' \ndevelop illness in the future. To date, most claims have been paid to \nnon-injured claimants. Some plaintiffs' attorneys are signing up \nthousands of individual plaintiffs onto suits where there may be no \nevidence of injury or no evidence of exposure to asbestos products. The \neffect is that the largest portion of the claim pool is being paid to \nnon-injured claimants. As a result, this adversely affects the ability \nof truly injured plaintiffs to collect damages. Claimants with \nmalignant injuries are being lost in the stampede of those not injured. \nThere is not only less money for those who really need it, the courts \nare swamped with a flood of questionable claims. It is not surprising \nthat the U.S. Supreme Court has twice called out for Congress to find a \nsolution.\n  Congress must indeed act. We must find a solution that both protects \nthe economy and the legal rights of those truly injured by asbestos or \nwho will develop asbestos-related injuries in the future. That is why \ntoday I introduce a bill that will not only introduce criteria to \nreassert some control over an out-of-control litigation process, but \nwill come to the assistance of those truly injured and who need help. \nIt is also intended to put a halt to the severe damage asbestos \nlitigation has been wrecking on our economy, so that we can get on with \nthe process of economic recovery.\n  My bill, entitled the Asbestos Claims Criteria and Compensation Act \nof 2003, establishes medical criteria that a claimant must meet prior \nto filing a suit. It will also toll the statute of limitations, so that \nthose who develop an asbestos-related disease years down the road will \nstill retain their right of legal action. It also will limit abusive \nvenue shopping, but provides an exception of venue choice for those \nterminally-ill and facing a shortened life expectancy.\n  In conclusion, I believe this bill offers a reasonable approach to \nresolving this serious problem. I believe it offers a solid bipartisan \napproach that many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will \ncome to support. If ever we hope to stimulate our economy into recovery \nand achieve sustained growth, we must also address and eliminate those \nfactors that tend to drag the economy in the opposite direction. \nAsbestos litigation is one of those inhibitors of the economy, and this \nbill is a good step toward recovery. I encourage my colleagues to lend \ntheir support to this bill and I thank you, Mr. President. I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 413\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) asbestos is a mineral that was widely used before the \n     1980s for insulation, fireproofing, and other purposes;\n       (2) millions of American workers and others were \n     significantly exposed to asbestos, especially during and \n     after World War II and before the advent of regulation by the \n     Occupational Safety and Health Administration in the early \n     1970s;\n       (3) exposure to asbestos has been associated with various \n     types of cancer, including mesothelioma and lung cancer, and \n     such nonmalignant conditions as asbestosis, pleural plaques, \n     and diffuse pleural thickening;\n       (4) the diseases caused by asbestos have latency periods of \n     up to 40 years or more, but the most serious asbestos-related \n     disease, mesothelioma, is fatal within 1 to 2 years, and \n     other related cancers are often fatal;\n       (5) although the use of asbestos has dramatically declined \n     since 1980 and workplace exposures have been regulated since \n     1971 by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, \n     past exposures will continue to result in significant death \n     and disability from mesothelioma and other cancers well into \n     the 21st century;\n       (6) exposure to asbestos has created a flood of litigation \n     targeting approximately 8,400 defendant companies in Federal \n     and State courts that the United States Supreme Court has \n     characterized as ``an elephantine mass'' of cases that \n     ``defies customary judicial administration and calls for \n     national legislation,'' Ortiz v. Fibreboard Corporation, 119 \n     S. Ct. 2295, 2302 (1999);\n       (7) the American Bar Association supports enactment of \n     Federal legislation that would--\n       (A) allow persons alleging non-malignant asbestos-related \n     disease claims to file a cause of action in Federal or State \n     court only if those persons meet the medical criteria in the \n     ``ABA Standard for Non-Malignant Asbestos-Related Disease \n     Claims'' dated February 2003 or an appropriate similar \n     medical standard; and\n       (B) toll all applicable statutes of limitations until such \n     time as the medical criteria in such standard are met;\n       (8) asbestos personal injury litigation can be unfair and \n     inefficient, imposing a severe burden on litigants and \n     taxpayers alike, in most cases involving defendant companies \n     that were never involved in the production of asbestos;\n       (9) the extraordinary volume of nonmalignant asbestos cases \n     continues to strain Federal and State courts, with over \n     200,000 cases pending and over 50,000 new cases filed each \n     year;\n       (10) asbestos personal injury litigation has already \n     contributed to the bankruptcy of more than 60 companies and \n     the rate of asbestos-driven bankruptcies is accelerating;\n       (11) the vast majority of asbestos claims are filed by \n     individuals who--\n       (A) have been exposed to asbestos;\n       (B) may have some physical sign of exposure; and\n       (C) suffer no present asbestos-related impairment;\n       (12) the cost of compensating exposed persons who are not \n     sick--\n       (A) jeopardizes the ability of defendants to compensate \n     people with cancer and other serious asbestos-related \n     diseases, now and in the future; and\n       (B) strains the ability of courts to manage the deluge of \n     cases involving nonimpaired plaintiffs;\n       (13) an estimated 50,000 to 60,000 workers have lost their \n     jobs as a direct result of asbestos litigation and related \n     bankruptcies of\n\n[[Page S2494]]\n\n     defendant companies and each displaced worker will, on \n     average, lose between $25,000 and $50,000 in lost wages;\n       (14) employees of defendant companies declaring bankruptcy \n     (who are often stockholders of those companies) will, on \n     average, lose 25 percent of the value of their retirement \n     investment under section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code \n     of 1986 because of lost stock value;\n       (15) concerns about statutes of limitations can force \n     claimants who have been exposed to asbestos but who have no \n     current injury to bring premature lawsuits in order to \n     protect against losing their rights to future compensation \n     should those claimants become impaired;\n       (16) consolidations, joinder, and similar procedures, to \n     which some courts have resorted in order to deal with the \n     mass of asbestos cases, can undermine the appropriate \n     functioning of the judicial process and encourage the filing \n     of thousands of cases by exposed persons who are not yet sick \n     and who may never become sick;\n       (17) the availability of sympathetic forums in States with \n     no connection to the plaintiff or to the exposures that form \n     the basis of a lawsuit has encouraged the filing of thousands \n     of cases on behalf of exposed persons who are not yet sick \n     and may never become sick;\n       (18) asbestos litigation, if left unchecked by reasonable \n     congressional intervention, will--\n       (A) continue to inhibit the economy and run counter to \n     plans to stimulate economic growth and the creation of new \n     jobs;\n       (B) threaten the savings, retirement benefits, and \n     employment of defendants' current and retired employees;\n       (C) affect adversely the communities in which these \n     defendants operate; and\n       (D) impair interstate commerce and national initiatives, \n     including national security; and\n       (19) the public interest and the interest of interstate \n     commerce requires deferring the claims of exposed persons who \n     are not sick in order to--\n       (A) preserve, now and for the future, defendants' ability \n     to compensate people who develop cancer and other serious \n     asbestos-related injuries; and\n       (B) safeguard the jobs, benefits, and savings of American \n     workers and the well-being of the national economy.\n       (b) Purposes.--It is the purpose of this Act to--\n       (1) give priority to those asbestos claimants who can \n     demonstrate actual physical harm or illness caused by \n     asbestos;\n       (2) fully preserve the rights of claimants who were exposed \n     to asbestos to pursue compensation should those claimants \n     become sick in the future;\n       (3) enhance the ability of the Federal and State judicial \n     systems to supervise and control asbestos litigation and \n     asbestos-related bankruptcy proceedings; and\n       (4) conserve the scarce resources of the defendants, and \n     marshal assets in bankruptcy, to allow compensation of cancer \n     victims and others who are physically harmed by exposure to \n     asbestos while securing the right to similar compensation for \n     those who may suffer physical harm in the future.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Con. Res. 5\n\n       Whereas reaching the shores of the Mississippi River \n     represented a major milestone for the westward expansion of \n     the system of railroad infrastructure that began on the East \n     Coast in the 1830s;\n       Whereas in 1854 the Chicago and Rock Island Railroad became \n     the first railroad to reach the Mississippi River and that \n     achievement was celebrated with a combined railroad and \n     riverboat trip known as the ``Grand Excursion of 1854'';\n       Whereas the Grand Excursion of 1854 began in Chicago with a \n     gathering of more than 1,000 dignitaries from professions \n     encompassing the fields of government, education, business, \n     journalism, and the arts, and included most prominently \n     former United States President Millard Fillmore;\n       Whereas the excursion party of 1854 traveled from Chicago, \n     Illinois, to Rock Island, Illinois, by train and then \n     proceeded by boat from Rock Island to the present-day twin \n     cities of Minneapolis, Minnesota, and St. Paul, Minnesota;\n       Whereas the Grand Excursion of 1854 is credited both with \n     bringing the upper Mississippi Valley into the national \n     spotlight and with solidifying Chicago's role as a major \n     transportation hub;\n       Whereas communities located on the 419 mile stretch between \n     Rock Island and Minneapolis are investing more than \n     $5,000,000,000 in recreational, commercial, and environmental \n     improvements to prepare for the celebration of the Grand \n     Excursion in 2004;\n       Whereas an educational program in Illinois, Iowa, \n     Wisconsin, and Minnesota will bring the history of the \n     Mississippi River to life for thousands of students from \n     kindergarten through 12th grade and will focus on the \n     recreational, environmental, and commercial importance of the \n     river;\n       Whereas the Grand Excursion celebration of 2004 will \n     establish a series of permanent exhibits throughout the upper \n     Mississippi River, recognizing the achievements of the many \n     communities and celebrating the history of the Mississippi \n     River;\n       Whereas the Grand Excursion, through its local, regional, \n     national, and international marketing programs and \n     initiatives, will communicate to the world the incredible \n     attributes of the upper Mississippi River and will invite \n     hundreds of thousands of visitors to the region to celebrate;\n       Whereas the National Park Service, along with other \n     Federal, State, and local agencies and many other interested \n     groups, is preparing activities to celebrate the \n     sesquicentennial of the Grand Excursion in 2004, to educate \n     local residents and visitors about the attributes of the \n     river, and to commemorate the occasion by establishing future \n     traditions that will improve community connections to the \n     river; and\n       Whereas Grand Excursion, Inc. is organizing and \n     coordinating the celebration in 2004 of the 150th anniversary \n     of the Grand Excursion of 1854: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) expresses its support for the work of all the Federal, \n     State, and local entities, and the work of all interested \n     groups that are preparing sesquicentennial activities to \n     celebrate the 150th anniversary of the Grand Excursion of \n     1854;\n       (2) expresses its support for the events to be held in \n     observance of the Grand Excursion of 1854 in Chicago, Rock \n     Island, Moline, and Galena, Illinois, in Davenport, Clinton, \n     and Dubuque, Iowa, in Prairie du Chien and La Crosse, \n     Wisconsin, in Wabasha, Winona, Red Wing, Saint Paul, and \n     Minneapolis, Minnesota, and in many other communities during \n     the sesquicentennial observance; and\n       (3) calls on the President of the United States, the \n     Secretary of Education, the Secretary of the Interior, the \n     Secretary of Defense, the Assistant Secretary of the Army, \n     the Director of the National Park Service, the Director of \n     the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, other public \n     officials, and the citizens of the United States to support, \n     promote, and participate in the many sesquicentennial \n     activities being planned to commemorate the Grand Excursion \n     of 1854.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to submit a resolution, \nwith my colleagues representing the Upper Mississippi River, expressing \nour support for the celebration in 2004 of the 150th Anniversary of the \nGrand Excursion.\n  In 1854, the Chicago and Rock Island Railroad became the first \nrailroad to reach from the East Coast to the Mississippi River. To \ncelebrate, Henry Farnam, a contractor for the railroad, organized an \nexcursion for friends, family, and stockholders. Word about this event \nspread quickly and a group of 1,200 people, including former President \nMillard Fillmore, traveled by steamboat from Rock Island, IL to St. \nPaul, MN.\n  This grand excursion turned into an opportunity to show influential \npersons of the day the remarkable beauty, numerous resources, and the \nunlimited opportunities that the Mississippi River and the West could \nprovide. This excursion brought millions of dollars of investment to \nthe area and positioned the Upper Mississippi region as a dominant \nforce in the development of the nation in the 19th century.\n  Once again, the Grand Excursion is an opportunity to highlight the \nrecreational, commercial, and environmental opportunities the river \nprovides, as well as celebrate the renaissance of the Upper Mississippi \nRiver region. Over 50 communities, 23 regional organizations, and 4 \nstates are joining together to make this celebration a reality.\n  For the past 10-15 years, communities in Iowa, Wisconsin, and \nMinnesota have been working together to reclaim their relationship with \nthe Mississippi River and reestablish vibrant riverfront communities. \nPlanning for the celebration has been a catalyst for over $5 billion in \ncapital improvements and environmental initiatives along the river.\n  In Iowa, communities such as the Quad Cities, Dubuque, and Clinton \nhave all rallied together to make their riverfronts engines for \neconomic development. The Quad Cities are the kickoff site for the \nGrand Flotilla taking\n\n[[Page S2497]]\n\nplace in June of 2004. Dubuque is the home of the National Mississippi \nRiver Museum and Aquarium, as well as the home dock of the Audubon Ark. \nAll of the participating Iowa cities have welcoming marinas, main \nstreets, and fun events planned for the celebration. I am honored to be \na partner with these dynamic communities.\n  Through the Grand Excursion 2004, hundreds of thousands of citizens \nwill experience America's River, a matchless national treasure, through \ncommunity festivities, educational events, enhanced recreation \nopportunities, and cultural programs. Those who are unable to \nparticipate first-hand in the celebrations will be able to experience \nthe excitement through a first-class website and educational \nExploration Trunks that will be provided with curriculum to classrooms \naround the country.\n  I hope that you will join me in supporting this resolution of \nAmerica's celebration of the Upper Mississippi River: Grand Excursion \n2004.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 6--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS THAT A \n    COMMEMORATIVE POSTAGE STAMP SHOULD BE ISSUED IN HONOR OF DANIEL \n   ``CHAPPIE'' JAMES, THE NATION'S FIRST AFRICAN-AMERICAN FOUR-STAR \n                                GENERAL\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Governmental Affairs:\n\n                             S.

Madam President, I rise today in celebration of Black \nHistory Month and a true American hero, General Daniel ``Chappie'' \nJames, Jr. To commemorate Daniel ``Chappie'' James' life, I submit a \nresolution, today, to create a postage stamp in his honor. General \nJames was a patriot for his country and broke down racial walls in the \nArmed Forces for all people of color. Not only was General James the \nfirst African American four-star general in the Air Force, but he was \nthe first African American four-star general in any service. \nRegrettably, too few Americans know of his heroism and contributions to \nthe United States.\n  General James dedicated his career to the defense of the United \nStates and improving the plight of Blacks in the military. ``Chappie'' \nJames learned to fly as a student at the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama. \nIn 1943 he was commissioned in the segregated U.S. Army Air Corps. He \nwas a member and trainer of the famed Tuskegee Airmen. Due to harsh \nprejudice, White officers doubted Blacks could be competent pilots, but \nthe Tuskegee Airmen answered all critics by remarkably executing over \n200 dangerous escort missions for American bombers during World War II \nwithout losing a single bomber. Following World War II, General James \nflew 179 fighter missions over Korea and North Vietnam. He commanded \nthe Bolo MiG sweep over North Vietnam which destroyed seven North \nVietnamese MiG-21s--the highest total kill of any one Air Force mission \nduring the Vietnam War.\n  Throughout his life in the Air Force, Chappie James continued to \nbreak the color barrier. It was not an easy task, as it was fraught \nwith road blocks. Nevertheless, General James pressed on to become a \nBrigadier General and the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for \nPublic Affairs in 1970. In 1975, Daniel James achieved the rank of \nGeneral and was named chief-of-staff of the North American Aerospace \nDefense Command.\n  General James never forgot the struggles he faced as a Black man in \nthe United States military, but his love for America never wavered. \nGeneral James sought to right the wrongs he encountered, not run from \nthem. In summation of his 35 years in the Air Corps and Air Force, he \nsaid, ``I've fought in three wars and three more wouldn't be too many \nto defend my country. I love America and as she has weaknesses or ills, \nI'll hold her hand.'' General James spent a life-time in service to his \ncountry and curing her of her weakness and ills. We should aspire to \nthe same and continue his fight for equality.\n  To commemorate General James' life, I am submitting a resolution, \ntoday, to create a postage stamp in his honor. I hope my colleagues \nwill support this measure and join me paying tribute to a great \nAmerican.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 7--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS THAT \nTHE SHARP ESCALATION OF ANTI-SEMITIC VIOLENCE WITHIN MANY PARTICIPATING \n   STATES OF THE ORGANIZATION FOR SECURITY AND COOPERATION IN EUROPE \n   (OSCE) IS OF PROFOUND CONCERN AND EFFORTS SHOULD BE UNDERTAKEN TO \n                       PREVENT FUTURE OCCURRENCES\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL (for himself, Mr. Smith, and Mrs. Clinton) submitted the \nfollowing concurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on \nForeign Relations:\n\n                             S. Con. Res. 7\n\n       Whereas the expressions of anti-Semitism experienced \n     throughout the region encompassing the participating States \n     of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe \n     (OSCE) have included physical assaults, with some instances \n     involving weapons or stones, arson of synagogues, and \n     desecration of Jewish cultural sites, such as cemeteries and \n     statues;\n       Whereas vicious propaganda and violence in many OSCE States \n     against Jews, foreigners, and others portrayed as alien have \n     reached alarming levels, in part due to the dangerous \n     promotion of aggressive nationalism by political figures and \n     others;\n       Whereas violence and other manifestations of xenophobia and \n     discrimination can never be justified by political issues or \n     international developments;\n       Whereas the Copenhagen Concluding Document adopted by the \n     OSCE in 1990 was the first international agreement to condemn \n     anti-Semitic acts, and the OSCE participating States pledged \n     to ``clearly and unequivocally condemn totalitarianism, \n     racial and ethnic hatred, anti-Semitism, xenophobia, and \n     discrimination against anyone as well as persecution on \n     religious and ideological grounds'';\n       Whereas the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly at its meeting in \n     Berlin in July 2002, unanimously adopted a resolution that, \n     among other things, called upon participating States to \n     ensure aggressive law enforcement by local and national \n     authorities, including thorough investigation of anti-Semitic \n     criminal acts, apprehension of perpetrators, initiation of \n     appropriate criminal prosecutions, and judicial proceedings;\n       Whereas Decision No. 6 adopted by the OSCE Ministerial \n     Council at its Tenth Meeting held in Porto, Portugal in \n     December 2002 (the ``Porto Ministerial Declaration'') \n     condemned ``the recent increase in anti-Semitic incidents in \n     the OSCE area, recognizing the role that the existence of \n     anti-Semitism has played throughout history as a major threat \n     to freedom'';\n       Whereas the Porto Ministerial Declaration also urged ``the \n     convening of separately designated human dimension events on \n     issues addressed in this decision, including on the topics of \n     anti-Semitism, discrimination and racism, and xenophobia''; \n     and\n\n[[Page S2498]]\n\n       Whereas on December 10, 2002, at the Washington \n     Parliamentary Forum on Confronting and Combating anti-\n     Semitism in the OSCE Region, representatives of the United \n     States Congress and the German Parliament agreed to denounce \n     all forms of anti-Semitism and agreed that ``anti-Semitic \n     bigotry must have no place in our democratic societies'': \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) officials of the executive branch and Members of \n     Congress should raise the issue of anti-Semitism in their \n     bilateral contacts with other countries and at multilateral \n     fora, including meetings of the Permanent Council of the \n     Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) \n     and the Twelfth Annual Session of the OSCE Parliamentary \n     Assembly to be convened in July 2003;\n       (2) participating States of the OSCE should unequivocally \n     condemn anti-Semitism (including violence against Jews and \n     Jewish cultural sites), racial and ethnic hatred, xenophobia, \n     and discrimination, as well as persecution on religious \n     grounds whenever it occurs;\n       (3) participating States of the OSCE should ensure \n     effective law enforcement by local and national authorities \n     to prevent and counter criminal acts stemming from anti-\n     Semitism, xenophobia, or racial or ethnic hatred, whether \n     directed at individuals, communities, or property, including \n     maintaining mechanisms for the thorough investigation and \n     prosecution of such acts;\n       (4) participating States of the OSCE should promote the \n     creation of educational efforts throughout the region \n     encompassing the participating States of the OSCE to counter \n     anti-Semitic stereotypes and attitudes among younger people, \n     increase Holocaust awareness programs, and help identify the \n     necessary resources to accomplish this goal;\n       (5) legislators in all OSCE participating States should \n     play a leading role in combating anti-Semitism and ensure \n     that the resolution adopted at the 2002 meeting of the OSCE \n     Parliamentary Assembly in Berlin is followed up by a series \n     of concrete actions at the national level; and\n       (6) the OSCE should organize a separately designated human \n     dimension event on anti-Semitism as early as possible in \n     2003, consistent with the Porto Ministerial Declaration \n     adopted by the OSCE at the Tenth Meeting of the OSCE \n     Ministerial Council in December 2002.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to submit Senate Concurrent \nResolution 7, expressing the sense and concern of the Congress \nregarding the recent spike in anti-Semitic violence that occurred in \nmany participating States of the 55-nation Organization for Security \nand Cooperation in Europe, OSCE. It is incumbent upon us to send a \nclear message that these malicious acts are a serious concern to the \nUnited States Senate and American people and that we will not be silent \nin the face of this disturbing trend.\n  The anti-Semitic violence we witnessed in 2002, which stretched the \nwidth and breadth of the OSCE region, is a wake-up call that this old \nevil still lives today. Coupled with a resurgence of aggressive \nnationalism and an increase in neo-Nazi ``skin head'' activity, myself, \nand other Commissioners on the Helsinki Commission, have diligently \nurged the leaders of OSCE participating States to confront and combat \nthe evil of anti-Semitism. Attacks on members of the Jewish community \nand their institutions have ranged from shootings, fire bombings, and \nphysical assaults in places as different as London, Paris, Berlin and \nKiev. Vandals have struck in Brussels, Marseilles, Bratislava, and \nAthens. Anti-Semitic propaganda has been spread in Moscow, Minsk and \nelsewhere as hatemongers have tapped into technology, including the \ninternet, to spread their venom. Yet while we witnessed a significant \nrise in violence last year in Europe, acts of vandalism have also \noccurred in the United States, so with encouraging our colleagues in \nother parliaments to act, we must be mindful that no country is immune.\n  As OSCE participating States, all member nations, including the \nUnited States, have pledged to unequivocally condemn anti-Semitism and \ntake effective measures to protect individuals from anti-Semitic \nviolence. Through the OSCE, which was the first multilateral \ninstitution to speak out against anti-Semitism, all of today's member \nstates share in that heritage. Thankfully, many OSCE states that I \nmentioned have responded appropriately, vigorously investigating the \nperpetrators and pursuing criminal prosecution. In short, \nmanifestations of anti-Semitism must not be tolerated, period, \nregardless of the source.\n  As Co-Chairman of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in \nEurope, I can report that the OSCE Proto Ministerial Council, through \nthe persistent efforts of the United States, addresses the phenomenon \nof anti-Semitism and called for the convening of a meeting specifically \nfocused on this timely issue. I introduce this resolution to put the \nUnited States Senate on record and send an unequivocal message that \nanit-Semitism must be confronted, and it must be confronted now. If \nanti-Semitism is ignored and allowed to grow, our societies and our \ncivilizations will suffer.

Madam President, I rise to express my support for the \nnomination of William H. Donaldson to be the Chairman of the United \nStates Securities and Exchange Commission.\n  In my view, Mr. Donaldson will bring considerable relevant experience \nto the position of SEC Chairman. He founded and managed a major \ninvestment company, Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, and served as \nChairman and CEO of the New York Stock Exchange. He was Chairman, \nPresident and CEO of a multi-billion dollar public company, Aetena, \nInc., and served as the first Dean and a Professor at the Yale School \nof Management. His background demonstrates that he is qualified for \nthis position.\n  Mr. Donaldson will face a daunting task as the new SEC Chairman. He \nmust join with his fellow Commissioners to appoint the Chairman of the \nPublic Company Accounting Oversight Board. He must address the \nchallenge of restoring confidence to the capital markets. And I very \nmuch hope that will move immediately to implement full pay parity of \nsalary and benefits for the SEC staff.\n  I am pleased that, in his appearance before the Senate Banking \nCommittee, Mr. Donaldson recognized the importance and immediate \nchallenge of implementing the new accounting responsibility and \ninvestor protection legislation which the Congress passed last year. He \ntestified that he ``will vigorously enforce the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and \nthe rules and regulations already put forth by the SEC.'' He said, ``I \nwill demand accountability from all responsible parties. I will \naggressively enforce civil penalties and work cooperatively with the \nstate and federal law enforcement agencies and the President's \ncorporate fraud task force to bring those who break the law to \njustice.'' He went on to pledge to call on\n\n[[Page S2500]]\n\ncorporate America and Wall Street to restore the principles of honesty \nand integrity to their proper place.\n  Mr. Donaldson also indicated a strong concern for the welfare of the \nSEC employees. He pledged to address issues of staff morale and union \nrelations at the Agency.\n  I am hopeful that Mr. Donaldson will effectively manage the SEC and \neffectively enforce the Federal securities laws. I hope that he will \nbring about a new era of respect for the Agency and confidence in the \nU.S. securities markets.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/13/senate-section/article/S2500-1", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2500]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nimmediately proceed to H.R. 395, which is being held at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 395) to authorize the Federal Trade Commission \n     to collect fees for the implementation and enforcement of a \n     ``do-not-call'' registry, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. McCain. Madam President, I am pleased that the Senate will pass \nH.R. 395, the Do-Not-Call Implementation Act, which was overwhelmingly \napproved by the House of Representatives yesterday.\n  All of us have been plagued by unwanted solicitations by \ntelemarketers. Recently, the Federal Trade Commission did something \nabout this and proposed regulations to create a national do no call \nregistry that consumers can sign up for to avoid unwanted \nsolicitations.\n  H.R. 395 authorizes the Federal Trade Commission, FTC, to collect \noffsetting fees from telemarketers to implement and enforce the \nregistry as part of the Telemarketing Sales Rule. The legislation would \nauthorize the FTC to collect these fees from telemarketers for Fiscal \nYears 2003 through 2007, and to move forward this year on setting up \nthis much-needed registry. The legislation also directs the Federal \nCommunications Commission to conclude its own relemaking regarding \ntelemarketing calls which, given the FTC's lack of jurisdiction over \ncertain industries, is an important component in creating an effective \nand comprehensive do not call option for consumers.\n  A one-stop option for consumers is overdue. In 1991, the Telephone \nConsumer Protection Act directed the Federal Communications Commission, \nFCC, to conduct a rulemaking to protect the privacy rights of \nresidential telephone subscribers. The FCC could have enacted a \nnational registry at that time, but chose instead of require \ntelemarketers to maintain their own individual do not call lists. This \nmeans that at present, most consumers must contact, individually, every \ntelemarketer who they do not want to call them. This far less than \nconsumer-friendly regime has spurred more than twenty-five States to \ncreate their own do-not-call registries. I understand that many of \nthese states support a national registry because maintenance of their \nlists is often burdensome, costly, and difficult to enforce. A national \nregistry will not preempt these state laws. Rather, States will work in \npartnership with the national registry by sharing information and \nenforcement abilities. Harmonizing the FTC regulations with those of \nthe FCC and the states, as I hope will soon occur, will give consumers \nand businesses alike a much more user-friendly system.\n  I recognize the importance of telemarketing to our economy and \nparticularly to new competitors' market entry. Consumers, nevertheless, \nshould be given a choice to opt out of receiving commercial \nsolicitations, and the national do-not-call list proposed by the FTC \ngives them this option. The FTC has endeavored to balance the interests \nof consumers against the interest businesses have in communicating with \nexisting customers and attracting new ones.\n  I commend the Federal Trade Commissioners and the FTC staff for their \nwork on this issue, and thank my colleagues for supporting this \nmeasure.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread the third time, passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and that any statements relating to the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 395) was read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/13/senate-section/article/S2500-4", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2500]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           CONSENT TO ASSEMBLE OUTSIDE THE SEAT OF GOVERNMENT\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Foreign \nRelations Committee be discharged from further consideration of S. Con. \nRes. 4 and that the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will state the concurrent resolution \nby title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 4) welcoming the \n     expression of support of 18 European nations for the \n     enforcement of United Nations Security Council Resolution \n     1441.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nconcurrent resolution.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, after leading the U.S. congressional \ndelegation to the Munich Conference on Security Policy last weekend, \nSenator Lieberman and I introduced this resolution to thank 18 \nEuropeans for standing with us in demanding that Security Council \nresolutions against Iraq be enforced. Contrary to what you may read in \nthe press, and despite shrill objections from Paris and Berlin, most \nEuropean governments believe Iraq must be held to account for its \ndefiance of Security Council Resolution 1441. France and Germany are \nisolated within Europe in their approach to enforcing, or in their case \nfailing to enforce, Security Council resolutions regarding Iraq.\n  Recent actions by Paris and Berlin in the most important \ninternational fora--the Security Council, the North Atlantic Council, \nand the European Union--raise serious doubts among nations on both \nsides of the Atlantic about their commitment to multilateral diplomacy \nand cause real damage to those institutions.\n  The French and German objection, for reasons of calculated self-\ninterest--a very flawed calculation, I fear--to a routine request to \nthe North Atlantic Council to upgrade Turkey's defenses\n\n[[Page S2501]]\n\nagainst the military threat from Iraq was a terrible injury to an \nAlliance that has served their broader interests well. For over three \nweeks, the United States, with fourteen of our eighteen European allies \nin the North Atlantic Council, has supported this necessary action, but \nhas confronted a new unilateralism conceived in Paris and Berlin, a \nunilateralism that exposed the sneering in those capitals about the \nimpulsive cowboy in the White House for the vacuous posturing and \nobvious misdirection it is.\n  Whatever NATO decides, Franco-German unilateralism will have a \nlasting impact on trans-Atlantic security calculations. If this \nminority French-German obstruction is not overcome, France and Germany \nwill have to answer to those who argue that Iraq could be to NATO what \nAbyssinia was to the League of Nations.\n  The United Nations Security Council risks that same fate should it \nfail to hold Iraq accountable for its defiance. Patient American and \nBritish diplomacy at the U.N. delivered a unanimous vote in favor of \nCouncil Resolution 1441. France played a key role in negotiating the \nresolution and knew what they were voting for, Germany was fully aware \nof the debate as it prepared to assume the Council presidency in \nJanuary. Americans, and many Europeans, were therefore astonished when \nFrance and Germany announced in advance of further consideration of the \nproblem of Iraq that under no circumstances would they support \nenforcing the resolution's terms against Iraq.\n  The behavior of France and Germany has set back European unity and \ncreated a divided front that makes Iraq's peaceful disarmament less \nlikely. Nations across Europe that have recently expressed a different \nview of multilateral obligations, including some of our oldest allies \nand our newest friends, expose the myth that France and Germany speak \nfor Europe.\n  The majority of Europe's democracies have spoken, and their message \ncould not be clearer. Most European governments support the Security \nCouncil's clear mandate to require Iraq's full disarmament and do not \nshrink from the grave responsibilities such a commitment entails. Most \nEuropean government understand clearly that if the Security Council \nfails to enforce its demands of Iraq, the Council risks impotence and \nirrelevance. In short, most European governments behave like allies \nthat are willing to meet their responsibilities to uphold international \npeace and security in defense of our common values.\n\n  As the foreign ministers of Romania, Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, \nLithuania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Croatia, Albania, and Macedonia have \ndeclared, ``the clear and present danger posed by Saddam Hussein's \nregime requires a united response from the community of democracies. We \ncall upon the U.N. Security Council to take the necessary and \nappropriate action in response to Iraq's continuing threat to \ninternational peace and security.''\n  As the leaders of Britain, Spain, Italy, Poland, Hungary, the Czech \nRepublic, Denmark, and Portugal have written, ``Resolution 1441 is \nSaddam Hussein's last chance to disarm using peaceful means. The \nopportunity to avoid greater confrontation rests with him. . . . [T]he \nSecurity Council must maintain its credibility by ensuring full \ncompliance with its resolutions. We cannot allow a dictator to \nsystematically violate those resolutions. If they are not complied \nwith, the Security Council will lose its credibility and world peace \nwill suffer as a result.''\n  We thank this European majority for standing with us.\n  I ask unanimous consent that two pieces of supporting material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            United We Stand\n\n       The real bond between the U.S. and Europe is the values we \n     share: democracy, individual freedom, human rights and the \n     rule of law. These values crossed the Atlantic with those who \n     sailed from Europe to help create the United States of \n     America. Today they are under greater threat than ever.\n  The attacks of Sept. 11 showed just how far terrorists--the enemies \nof our common values--are prepared to go to destroy them. Those \noutrages were an attack on all of us. In standing firm in defense off \nthese principles, the governments and people of the U.S. and Europe \nhave amply demonstrated the strength of their convictions. Today more \nthan ever, the trans-Atlantic bond is a guarantee of our freedom.\n       We in Europe have a relationship with the U.S. which has \n     stood the test of time. Thanks in large part to American \n     bravery, generosity and farsightedness, Europe was set free \n     from the two forms of tyranny that devastated our continent \n     in the 20th century: Nazism and communism. Thanks, too, to \n     the continued cooperation between Europe and the U.S. we have \n     managed to guarantee peace and freedom on our continent. The \n     trans-Atlantic relationship must not become a casualty of the \n     current Iraqi regime's persistent attempts to threaten world \n     security.\n       In today's world, more than ever before, it is vital that \n     we preserve that unity and cohesion. We know that success in \n     the day-to-day battle against terrorism and the proliferation \n     of weapons of mass destruction demands unwavering \n     determination and firm international cohesion on the part of \n     all countries for whom freedom is precious.\n       The Iraqi regime and its weapons of mass destruction \n     represent a clear threat to world security. This danger has \n     been explicitly recognized by the U.N. All of us are bound by \n     Security Council Resolution 1441, which was adopted \n     unanimously. We Europeans have since reiterated our backing \n     for Resolution 1441, our wish to pursue the U.N. route, and \n     our support for the Secretary Council at the Prague NATO \n     Summit and the Copenhagen European Council.\n       In doing so, we sent a clear, firm and unequivocal message \n     that we would rid the world of the danger posed by Saddam \n     Hussein's weapons of mass destruction. We must remain united \n     in insisting that his regime be disarmed. The solidarity, \n     cohesion and determination of the international community are \n     our best hope of achieving this peacefully. Our strength lies \n     in unity.\n       The combination of weapons of mass destruction and \n     terrorism is a threat of incalculable consequences. It is one \n     at which all of us should feel concerned. Resolution 1441 is \n     Saddam Hussein's last chance to disarm using peaceful means. \n     The opportunity to avoid greater confrontation rests with \n     him. Sadly this week the U.N. weapons inspectors have \n     confirmed that his long-established pattern of deception, \n     denial and noncompliance with U.N. Security Council \n     resolutions is continuing.\n       Europe has no quarrel with the Iraqi people. Indeed, they \n     are the first victims of Iraq's current brutal regime. Our \n     goal is to safeguard world peace and security by ensuring \n     that this regime gives up its weapons of mass destruction. \n     Our governments have a common responsibility to face this \n     threat. Failure to do so would be nothing less than negligent \n     to our own citizens and to the wider world.\n       The U.N. Charter charges the Security Council with the task \n     of preserving international peace and security. To do so, the \n     Security Council must maintain its credibility by ensuring \n     full compliance with its resolutions. We cannot allow a \n     dictator to systematically violate those resolutions. If they \n     are not complied with, the Security Council will lose its \n     credibility and world peace will suffer as a result. We are \n     confident that the Security Council will face up to its \n     responsibilities.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                Statement of the Vilnius Group Countries\n\n       Earlier today, the United States presented compelling \n     evidence to the United Nations Security Council detailing \n     Iraq's weapons of mass destruction programs, its active \n     efforts to deceive UN inspectors, and its links to \n     international terrorism.\n       Our countries understand the dangers posed by tyranny and \n     the special responsibility of democracies to defend our \n     shared values. The trans-Atlantic community, of which we are \n     a part, must stand together to face the threat posed by the \n     nexus of terrorism and dictators with weapons of mass \n     destruction.\n       We have actively supported the international efforts to \n     achieve a peaceful disarmament of Iraq. However, it has now \n     become clear that Iraq is in material breach of U.N. Security \n     Council Resolutions, including U.S. Resolution 1441, passed \n     unanimously on November 8, 2002. As our governments said on \n     the occasion of the NATO Summit in Prague: ``We support the \n     goal of the international community for full disarmament of \n     Iraq as stipulated in the U.N. Security Council Resolution \n     1441. In the event of non-compliance with the terms of this \n     resolution, we are prepared to contribute to an international \n     coalition to enforce its provisions and the disarmament of \n     Iraq.''\n       The clear and present danger posed by the Saddam Hussein's \n     regime requires a united response from the community of \n     democracies. We call upon the U.N. Security Council to take \n     the necessary and appropriate action in response to Iraq's \n     continuing threat to international peace and security.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nconcurrent resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements \nrelating to this matter be printed in the Record as if read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S2502]]\n\n  The concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 4) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The concurrent resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                             S. Con. Res. 4\n\n       Whereas on November 8, 2002, the United Nations Security \n     Council approved Security Council Resolution 1441 under \n     Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter by a vote of 15-0, \n     giving Iraq ``a final opportunity to comply with its \n     disarmament obligations'';\n       Whereas on November 21, 2002, the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization's North Atlantic Council unanimously approved a \n     declaration stating, ``We deplore Iraq's failure to comply \n     fully with its obligations which were imposed as a necessary \n     step to restore international peace and security and we \n     recall that the Security Council has decided in its \n     resolution to afford Iraq a final opportunity to comply with \n     its disarmament obligations under relevant resolutions of the \n     Council.'';\n       Whereas the North Atlantic Council stated, ``NATO Allies \n     stand united in their commitment to take effective action to \n     assist and support the efforts of the United Nations to \n     ensure full and immediate compliance by Iraq, without \n     conditions or restrictions, with United Nations Security \n     Council Resolution 1441. We recall that the Security Council \n     in this resolution has warned Iraq that it will face serious \n     consequences as a result of its continued violation of its \n     obligations.'';\n       Whereas, on January 30, 2003, the Prime Ministers of \n     Denmark, Italy, Hungary, Poland, Portugal, Spain, and the \n     United Kingdom, and the President of the Czech Republic \n     (``The Eight''), issued a declaration regarding Security \n     Council Resolution 1441;\n       Whereas in their declaration, The Eight stated, ``The \n     transatlantic relationship must not become a casualty of the \n     current Iraqi regime's persistent attempts to threaten world \n     security. . . .

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S.

Madam President, I offer this resolution with Senator \nSmith to congratulate the University of Portland women's soccer team \nfor winning the 2002 NCAA Division I National Championship.\n  This championship team achieved a lot of firsts. The women's soccer \nteam is the first to bring home a national championship in any sport \nfor the University of Portland. As the eighth seed in the NCAA \ntournament, the University of Portland Pilots were the lowest seeded \nteam to ever win the national title in the women's national \nchampionship 21 year history. Sophomore player Christine Sinclair made \na first by setting an NCAA tournament record with 21 points on 10 goals \nand 1 assist. The Pilots' road to victory included defeating 7 \nnationally ranked opponents, including the reigning champion, Santa \nClara University.\n  I am proud of these young women and their tremendous accomplishment. \nIn this day when Title IX of the Education Amendments is under \nchallenge, we cannot forget that women like those of the University of \nPortland champion soccer team are direct beneficiaries of Title IX. \nTitle IX has provided girls and women with equal opportunities in \nathletics. Before Title IX was enacted in 1972, only one in 17 high \nschool girls played team sports--now that number is one in 2.5. Title \nIX has helped our Nation develop fantastic athletes like the young \nwomen I am here to congratulate. We must continue to encourage these \nathletes, and provide them with our full support.\n  Mr. FRIST.
