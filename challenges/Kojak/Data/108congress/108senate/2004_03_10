Con.

Mr. President, I have a short statement I will give, and I \nassume the Democratic leader will have a statement. Following that, I \nask unanimous consent that the Senator from Nevada be recognized.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I want to open by congratulating the \nchairman of the Senate Budget Committee and ranking member and all \ncommittee members for the outstanding work they have done in bringing \nthis resolution to the floor in a very timely manner. It was a little \nover a month ago that the President of the United States transmitted \nhis proposed budget to the Congress, and the Budget Committee, under \nreal time constraints, was able to hold hearings and debate, mark up, \nand report its own congressional budget plan and bring it to the floor \nlast Thursday evening.\n  My experience with budget resolutions on the Senate floor tells me \nthat\n\n[[Page S2466]]\n\nit will become very hectic, really beginning today and tomorrow and the \nnext day--over the next 3 days. There is a limited amount of time, as \nwe all know. There are 27 hours remaining for debate on that resolution \nas of this morning. That time will end up passing very quickly, \nparticularly when we have a recess sitting on the other end awaiting \ncompletion of this resolution.\n  As I mentioned earlier, we will complete this budget resolution this \nweek before the recess. Since we have a limited time, I want to right \nupfront pay tribute to Chairman Nickles and one other Senator this \nmorning.\n  Chairman Nickles, as we all know, will be leaving the Senate at the \nend of his fourth term. After 2 years as chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, this will be the last Federal budget he will manage on the \nSenate floor. Last year, with his first budget resolution as chairman, \nwe were able to complete a budget resolution in record time. Eighty \namendments were offered last year and were all considered on the floor. \nThat was the third highest ever considered on the budget resolution in \nhistory. In 1998, there were 106 amendments. Last year was the third \nhighest.\n\n  I have had the opportunity to serve on the Budget Committee in the \npast and I know it is a very difficult assignment; it is a demanding \ncommittee. But I believe the ranking member would agree with me, while \nthe ranking member and the chairman have not always agreed on policy, \nSenator Nickles has maintained a fair and open and collegial committee \non which to work.\n  Six years before Senator Nickles was first elected to the Senate, in \nDecember 1974, Sam Ervin, the distinguished chairman of the Committee \non Governmental Operations, wrote:\n\n       I have no doubt that the Congressional Budget and \n     Impoundment Control Act of 1974 will stand as a monument to \n     the 93rd Congress and its devotion to our constitutional \n     system of Government.\n\n  This is the 30th anniversary of the enactment of the historic \nlegislation which established the Senate Budget Committee, established \nthe Congressional Budget Office, and established the procedures that we \nare involved in today in considering a congressional budget resolution.\n  Many did not expect that what at the time was a completely new \nprocess to survive. Indeed, it has survived over the last 30 years. In \na way, over those 30 years, it certainly had its bumps and bruises. \nJust down the road from Senator Ervin's home, one Senator, and only one \nSenator in this Chamber today, has served on the Budget Committee from \nits very beginning, and that is Senator Fritz Hollings. He has been \nthere from the very beginning. For 2 years, in 1979 and 1980, Senator \nHollings--and this was when Ed Muskie left the Senate to serve as \nSecretary of State under President Carter--also served as its chairman.\n  Just a little bit of budget trivia: As I was looking through the \nhistory, the first reconciliation bill was, indeed, crafted under \nChairman Hollings' leadership in 1980.\n  Senator Hollings was instrumental in the first major reforms to the \nFederal budget process, being one of the authors, along with Senators \nGramm and Rudman, of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control \nAct of 1985, more familiarly known as Gramm-Rudman-Hollings.\n  I mention Senator Hollings in part because of this long history, and \nI discussed some of it with him last night at dinner. As we all know, \nhe too will be voluntarily leaving the Senate at the end of this \nCongress. So this is his last budget resolution debate on the Senate \nfloor, and just like the 30 debates before, I am sure he will not \ndisappoint the Senate with his contribution to this debate over the \nnext 3 days.\n  We have begun deliberating a blueprint for next year's Federal \nbudget, and that is exactly what it is; it is truly a blueprint. For \nthose who may be observing these proceedings for the first time, it may \nappear we are passing laws on spending for our national defense, \neducation, or health programs, or it may appear we are enacting tax \nlegislation, but we are not. Listening to the debate it may sound like \nit but that is not what we are doing.\n  It is really not unlike a family sitting around the kitchen table at \nthe beginning of a new year discussing and estimating how much income \nthey will have over the course of the next 12 months, how that income \nwill be spent and how it should be allocated to the basic needs, \nwhether it is to their shelter, food, or health care, and then how much \nthey should save for their children's needs. It might be for schooling \nor it might be for their own retirement.\n  That is exactly what we are doing, or it is very similar to what we \nare doing, over the course of this week in this 50 hours of debate when \nwe are adopting a congressional budget plan.\n  Just like that family sitting around the kitchen table, we are going \nto have differences and those differences are going to be expressed. \nThere will be strong opinions on how our income should be divided among \nwhat people project as demands that will come and demands that we have \ntoday. Once we come to an agreement on a budget plan, which we will in \nthe next 3 days, just like that family, we will be tasked to implement \nit by passing the revenue and spending totals that are assumed in that \nblueprint.\n  We will also be asked to stick to it throughout the year, and so we \nwill be putting up some roadblocks and some warning signals in our \nbudget plan to remind us if we get off track or if we begin to go \nastray. Indeed, that is the importance of passing this budget \nresolution.\n  There are differences, just like sitting around that table in a \nfamily, when planning a budget. As we have heard over the last several \ndays, and we will hear for the next 3 days, there will be debate and an \namendment process. The big difference between what goes on here and \nwhat goes on with that family is size, the obvious one. Another \ndifference is that what we plan here can have a direct impact on that \nfamily sitting around that kitchen table.\n  Will we keep that family's taxes from increasing next January by \nplanning our budget here to prevent that child tax credit, now $1,000, \nfrom falling to $700 per child, thus taking $300 per child away from \nthat family?\n  Will we plan to keep the 10-percent rate bracket from dropping next \nJanuary from $4,300 to $12,000 as a threshold for joint filers?\n  Will we plan to prevent the standard deduction for that married \ncouple, and this is known as the marriage penalty tax, from dropping \nnext January and thereby continuing to penalize them simply because \nthey are married?\n  All of these, which we are talking about in the resolution, will keep \nfamilies from having to pay more beginning January. In fact, these \nthree tax items alone could mean the difference of over $13 billion in \nadditional take-home pay next year for nearly 38 million hard-working \nfamilies. Add that up and it becomes over $100 billion in additional \nincome to those families sitting around those kitchen tables over the \nnext 5 years. So what we plan for in our own Federal budget can and \nwill impact the budgets of millions of America's families in a very \ndirect way.\n  This is a challenging budget year. We are all aware it is a political \nyear, with the Presidential election this November, and thus reaching \nreal consensus on a budget will be difficult under the best of \ncircumstances, let alone in this Presidential election year.\n  The deficits we currently face are unacceptable. The budget crafted \nby the committee puts a priority on reducing them. We understand why \nthe deficits are there: recession and war on terror. Through this \nbudget plan we will cut those deficits in half over the next 3 years.\n  At the same time, the budget blueprint that we debate from the \ncommittee remains committed to certain priorities. The budget blueprint \nassumes spending for our national security will increase over $20 \nbillion next year. That is an increase of about 5.1 percent. It assumes \nfunding for domestic, or our homeland security, will increase by 15 \npercent. Both of these increases are essential in our war on terrorism.\n  Important domestic programs are not ignored. We all know a key to job \ngrowth in the future is one that gives a high priority to education, to \nretraining, to learning in schools, the basics of mathematics, writing, \nand verbal skills.\n  Chairman Greenspan recently testified:\n\n       By far the greatest contribution during the past century to \n     our average annual real GDP\n\n[[Page S2467]]\n\n     increase of 3\\1/4\\ percent has been the ideas embodied in \n     both our human and physical capital. Technological advance is \n     continually altering the shape, nature and complexity of our \n     economic processes.\n\n  Yes, education has always been, and will continue to be, the key to \nour country's economic future, and the blueprint assumes we will \nincrease funding for disadvantaged children for title I grants to local \neducation agencies by over 8 percent, up over $1 billion next year, \nbringing the total Federal funding for this program to $4.6 billion. \nThis program is the single largest Federal funding source for the No \nChild Left Behind legislation.\n  The resolution also makes room for increased funding for special \neducation, or the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. This \nincreased funding for special education assumes to go up by $1 billion, \nand that is the fourth consecutive year of $1 billion increases, \nbringing funding for this special education program next year to over \n$11.1 billion.\n  The resolution allows for a 5-percent increase in veterans medical \ncare funding, up $1.4 billion, to a total of nearly $30 billion for \nthese important programs next year.\n  The resolution also assumes moneys for critical international \nassistance programs, a 13.5-percent increase in discretionary funding \nin this area, including last year's newly authorized Millennium \nChallenge Corporation. Full funding for the HIV/AIDS initiative of $2.8 \nbillion next year is assumed in the blueprint, putting us on the path \nto meet our goal of $15 billion over 5 years.\n  In closing, these are a few of the priorities embodied in this \nblueprint. It does not please everyone. How could it? There is no \nguarantee that all of the assumptions in the blueprint will be \nfulfilled as we move on to the funding legislation that will implement \nthis blueprint.\n  The demands are great. The resources at this point in time are \nlimited. Just like a family making difficult and unpopular challenging \ndecisions, we, too, will not be able to provide all of the funds some \nthink are needed for particular programs or needed projects. I believe \nit is a solid, strong budget plan, presented to us by the chairman and \nthe committee and it is one that deserves our strong support.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, last Friday we were presented with the \nlatest report on the creation of new jobs in our economy. The \nadministration predicted about 200,000. In February, unfortunately, we \nonly created 21,000--180,000 short of what the administration \npredicted. If you don't count the increases in Government payroll, \nthere was actually no job growth whatsoever in the entire year of 2003. \nUnfortunately, that could also be said of 2002, and 2001.\n  The administration's economic forecasts appear to be little more than \nwishful thinking. A chart appeared in the New York Times yesterday that \nlays out very graphically how inaccurate the job predictions have been. \nIn his column yesterday, Paul Krugman wrote about this unfortunate \nmiscalculation in the prediction of jobs. His most graphic illustration \nof this miscalculation is entitled ``Promises, Promises.'' It is a \nchart. It is easy to understand.\n  The administration predicted in 2002 the creation of 138 million \njobs. Then in 2003 they corrected that prediction. They said it isn't \ngoing to be 138 million; it will be 135 million. In 2004, they said it \nisn't going to be 138 million, it isn't going to be 135 million, now \nit's going to be 132 million. Now we find out, in 2004, it wasn't 138, \n135, or 132 million; it was 130 million jobs, which means they were 8 \nmillion jobs off the mark in predicting where the non-farm payroll \nemployment rolls would be during the course of their term in office.\n  From the very first days in office, the Bush economic team has failed \nto understand what it takes to create jobs. I might say, as we look at \nthe job creation, this is American job creation. Unfortunately, I fear, \nwhile we don't have any numbers, the outsourcing job creation probably \ndoes exceed the prediction. I wouldn't be surprised if, under the watch \nof President Bush, we have actually seen more than 8 million jobs \ncreated. The problem is, most of them have been in India and China, and \ncountries in south Asia. It is American jobs we are gauging here, and \nit was a prediction that it was American jobs that would be created at \nthat 138 million level.\n  We know how to create jobs, but for some reason this administration \nhas not been willing to commit, in policy or in resources, the effort \nthat must be made to ensure those jobs are created. We had the most \nrecent illustration of that a couple of weeks ago. The transportation \nbill the Senate has now voted on, on an overwhelmingly bipartisan \nbasis, we are now told would create 1.7 million jobs in 6 years. South \nDakota would see over 5,000 jobs created; California, 87,000 jobs \ncreated; Texas, 60,000; New York, 61,000; Virginia, DC and Maryland, \n45,000 jobs. Thirty percent of our roads and bridges are in a state of \nsevere disrepair and those jobs would go to dealing with the incredible \nproblem we have with infrastructure deconstruction.\n  I think the broad support, 76-21, in the Senate marked yet another \nstatement about our appreciation of the magnitude, the importance of \nthat bill; yet what the administration has done in response to our \npassage of that bill is to say they would veto it today, veto it \nbecause they say we cannot afford it. We just talked yesterday about \nthe fact we are spending $27 billion this year to provide those who are \nmaking incomes of more than $1 million a tax break. We can afford to \ngive millionaires a tax break of $27 billion, but we can't afford the \ncommitment this country must make in infrastructure.\n\n  Ironically, that is about the difference between where the Senate is \nand where the administration wants to go with regard to highway \nconstruction funds. They would rather spend it on millionaires. Many of \nus feel very strongly it is important to spend it where we can create \njobs--not jobs in India, not jobs in China, but jobs here at home, \ntrying to meet that target the administration said was so important, \n138 million. They are right. It is important. We need to create those \njobs. But we are not going to do it with the policies that have so far \nbeen articulated by this administration.\n  Later today, Senator Boxer will be offering an amendment that will \ncreate jobs beyond those we now know could be created in the highway \nbill. We are going to allow for an amendment that would discourage the \nflow of jobs overseas and give assistance to workers whose jobs have \nbeen actually eliminated in the Bush economy. It would offer tax \ncredits to companies that create manufacturing jobs by making it more \naffordable for small businesses to offer coverage to their employees. \nIt would discourage the exporting of American jobs by eliminating the \ntax advantages for companies that take their plants overseas, and by \nprohibiting the Federal Government from dealing with contractors who \noutsource the work of their Government contracts to workers overseas. \nIt would also help workers who are dislocated by global economic forces \nby including service workers in the Trade Adjustment Assistance Program \nand by extending health care coverage to trade-dislocated workers.\n  Most of us believe families should not have to lose their health \ncoverage because of economic forces beyond their control. The amendment \nwe will be offering today says, while they are still trying to get back \non their feet, they must have the opportunity to access health care in \nsome form.\n  Since the administration has come to office, its economic policy has \nbeen to borrow money from foreign bankers, hand it over to the \nwealthiest people in the country, and hope for the best. The result is \na $9 trillion meltdown of our fiscal position and now the loss of 3 \nmillion jobs.\n  We need a new direction. Yesterday in the Washington Post the poll \nsuggested 57 percent of the American people shared that view. We have \ncome to a point where we must take a different direction. Economists \nare worried if jobs are not created soon, Americans could lose \nconfidence and spur an even steeper downturn in the economy.\n  We know how to create jobs. Let's pass the highway bill. Let's pass \nthe Boxer Democratic amendment today. Let's ensure we send the right \nmessage about the direction we want this country to take. We can do \nthat with this budget resolution and with legislation that has come \nbefore the Senate. I hope, on a bipartisan basis, we can send that \nmessage to the American people.\n\n[[Page S2468]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada is \nrecognized for up to 30 minutes under the previous order.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, this morning I rise to speak about the \nnational defense function of this budget resolution. The resolution \nprovides $413.9 billion in discretionary spending for our national \ndefense. This amount represents a increase of almost $20 billion, 5 \npercent above the 2004 level.\n  As chairman of the Readiness and Management Support Subcommittee of \nthe Armed Services Committee, I am keenly aware that today we are a \nnation at war. Almost 200,000 U.S. military service personnel are \ncurrently deployed around the world in Operation Iraqi Freedom, \nOperation Enduring Freedom, and other military operations in the \nongoing global war on terrorism.\n  Our soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines remain deployed in Korea, \nthe Balkans, at sea and elsewhere, protecting American interests and \ndeterring aggression.\n  There can be no disagreement on the magnificent manner which our \nArmed Forces have answered their nation's call. Their professionalism \nand performance have been brilliant, and their willingness to sacrifice \nfor this country is inspiring.\n  That is why I am so troubled today by the Democrats' response to \nPresident Bush's weekly radio address last Saturday. That response was \ndelivered by Senator John Kerry, their party's presumptive Presidential \nnominee.\n\n  We all know that each Senator has a right to state their opinion on \ndefense issues. However, when a Senator, or in this case, a party's \npresumptive nominee, makes an argument built on a foundation of facts \nas distorted as Senator Kerry's was, then the argument becomes more \nthan an honest disagreement.\n  He quoted the Secretary of the Army as saying that U.S. forces were \n``not prepared'' for the present conflict in Iraq.\n  This is the exact quote:\n\n       The Secretary of the Army admitted that the United States \n     forces were ``not prepared'' for the present conflict.\n\n  But yesterday at the Senate Armed Services Readiness Subcommittee \nhearing, the Vice Chief of Staff of the Army, General Casey, testified \nthat comment ``was taken out of context.'' He stated ``we were very \nwell prepared, all of the services.''\n  General Moseley, Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force, said, ``I \nwould have to tell you that . . . all airmen, whether they were Navy, \nMarine, or Air Force, were exceptionally well prepared. . . . and I \nwould take issue with anyone that criticized our magnificent airmen.''\n  General Huly, Deputy Commandant of the Marine Corps, said, ``I \nbelieve we were very well prepared . . . I think that's evidenced by \nthe fact that we exceeded our expectations, accomplished the mission in \na shorter period of time, with far fewer losses than we even \nanticipated ourselves.\n  Senator Kerry has woven a picture of incompetence and malfeasance by \nour military leaders and our President. Nothing could be further from \nthe truth. It is amazing the different pictures painted by those who \nhave been there, and those who have not.\n  I personally visited Iraq last December. As a matter of fact, I was \nprivileged to have been in the country the day the Third Infantry \nDivision captured Saddam Hussein. I have to tell you what impressed me \nthe most was watching our troops go above and beyond the call of duty; \npainting schools, rehabbing hospitals, and winning over the hearts and \nminds of the Iraqi people, even in the Tikrit region where their safety \nwas most at risk.\n  Watching events in Iraq unfold underscores that America is blessed \nwith more than her fair share of heroes. These men and women are doing \nwhat needs to be done in an extremely hostile environment. And they are \ndepending on this Congress to pass a budget that gives them the \nresources to complete their mission and return home safely to their \nfamilies. This budget ensures that the military has the resources it \nneeds to remain properly prepared and adequately equipped.\n  In his radio address, Senator Kerry also stated that: ``I will never \nsend our troops into harm's way without enough firepower and support.''\n  Strong words, but words alone offer little in this context and in the \noverall context of our budget discussions. It is interesting to note \nthat while Senator Kerry claims to be a devout supporter of our troops, \nhe was one of only 12 Senators who voted ``no'' for an Iraqi \nsupplemental that provided that very ``firepower'' and ``support'' he \nnow claims is so necessary.\n  The Iraqi supplemental was used to purchase the same body armor and \n``up-armored Humvees'' Senator Kerry rails about as being insufficient. \nIf we had allowed Senator Kerry to make the decision, our troops would \nindeed be ill prepared.\n  Votes have consequences. By voting against the Iraqi supplemental \nSenator Kerry voted to undermine the troops in the field and that is \nnot only inexcusable, it is reprehensible. I hope no Senator would make \nsuch an egregious mistake with respect to the current budget \nresolution.\n  Therefore, I am calling upon Senator Kerry to retract his comments \nabout our military being unprepared and to apologize to the men and \nwomen of our armed forces for using their sacrifices as political \nfodder. It is important to remember that in a democracy there will \nalways be honest differences of opinion over the difficult decisions \nabout the best way to fund, train, and equip American forces who are \nbeing sent into harms' way. I appreciate the opportunity to work with \nMembers on both sides of the aisle to resolve these differences.\n  On February 24, Senator Levin, ranking member of the Armed Services \nCommittee, sent a letter to Chairman Nickles and Senator Conrad.\n  In his letter he stated that ``no one can predict with precision what \nthese fiscal year 2005 costs will be'' and recommended an increase in \n``budget authority for the national defense function by $30 billion in \nfiscal year 2005.''\n  I agree with my distinguished colleague from Michigan when he said \nthat this is ``the responsible thing to do for our troops and for \nbudget accuracy.''\n  This budget takes Senator Levin's suggestions to heart and includes \nthe supplemental resources necessary to provide for the 200,000 men and \nwomen in our military who are currently serving abroad.\n  I look forward to working with my Senate colleagues to ensure that we \nadequately address the sacrifices of our men and women in uniform, by \npassing a budget resolution that provides the resources that will \nsustain and improve our military as they fight for security of this \ngreat Nation. By fully supporting this budget, we will send a clear \nmessage of support to our troops, worldwide, and an important message \nto the world of America's complete commitment to freedom and security.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina). The Senator \nfrom North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 5 minutes \nbefore Senator Murray begins her remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I don't know precisely what Senator Kerry \nwas referring to in his remarks the other day. But I think we all know \nthere were deficiencies in terms of resources provided to our troops \ngoing into Iraq and Afghanistan. We have all read the stories \nrepeatedly of soldiers not having the body armor they needed. We have \nall heard of people actually raising money back home in order to get \nthe body armor for our soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan. That should \nnot be. We shouldn't have a circumstance where American soldiers don't \nhave the best equipment to keep them safe when we have sent them into \nharm's way. I think we have all read the stories of our Humvees not \nbeing properly armored to protect soldiers against these bombs that \nhave been going off.\n  I remember very well going to Walter Reed Army Hospital visiting \nyoung men who had been badly injured in Iraq. I remember very well \nvisiting with one young soldier who had been in a Humvee that had not \nbeen properly armored. One of the roadside bombs had gone off, and that \nyoung soldier was terribly injured--blind in one eye,\n\n[[Page S2469]]\n\nlost a leg, an arm. He was badly wounded. As he lay in that bed, \nanother Senator and I visited him. As we left the room, having visited \nthat patient, we commented about how it can be that we send into Iraq \nHumvees not properly armored against the kind of truck bombs and \nroadside bombs that had been used to injure and kill our troops.\n  I don't know precisely what Senator Kerry was referring to in that \nspeech. We all know there were serious deficiencies in terms of body \narmor for our troops and in terms of Humvees being properly armored \nagainst bombs.\n  I think Senator Kerry was certainly not out of line in suggesting \nthat more could have been done to have our troops fully protected on \nthe battlefield.\n  I thank the Chair, and I thank especially my colleague from \nWashington, Senator Murray, who is such a valuable member of the Senate \nBudget Committee for permitting me to speak ahead of her.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nWashington is recognized to offer an amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2719\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

RESERVE FUND FOR NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND ACT EDUCATION \n                   PROGRAMS.\n\n       The Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate \n     shall revise the aggregates, functional totals, allocations \n     to the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate, \n     discretionary spending limits, and other appropriate levels \n     and limits in this resolution by up to $8,600,000,000 in \n     budget authority for fiscal year 2005, and by the amount of \n     outlays flowing therefrom in 2005 and subsequent years, for a \n     bill, joint resolution, motion, amendment, or conference \n     report that provides additional fiscal year 2005 \n     discretionary appropriations, in excess of levels provided in \n     this resolution, for Department of Education programs in the \n     No Child Left Behind Act (P.L. 107-110).\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing Senators be added as cosponsors: Senators Kennedy, Lieberman, \nMikulski, Corzine, Levin, Dodd, Stabenow, Clinton, Kerry, Harkin, \nSchumer, Pryor, Reed of Rhode Island, Kohl, Dayton, and Landrieu.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, parents, teachers, and students \nthroughout Washington State and across our entire country are looking \nfor our help today as they try to implement the No Child Left Behind \nAct.\n  Unfortunately, the budget before the Senate by the Republicans falls \n$8.6 billion short of what our schools and our students need this year. \nIt is yet another broken promise to our schools, our students, and our \nfamilies.\n  We can do better. That is why I am offering this amendment this \nmorning. I have visited schools in every corner of my State and I know \nfirsthand that our educators everywhere are working harder than ever to \nhelp their students to meet these new accountable requirements. They \nwant to do a good job. They want to do what is right. I also know it is \nnot fair for the Federal Government to leave our schools without the \nfunding they need to meet these Federal mandates we place on them.\n  Today our State and local budgets everywhere are stretched thin. Our \nlocal communities cannot afford to make up the difference between what \nour schools were promised and what this budget actually provides. That \nis why I am offering this amendment today to fully fund the No Child \nLeft Behind Act. My amendment tells students, teachers, and parents \nthat the Federal Government will be a full partner with our local \nschools as they carry out the new law we passed.\n  I am not asking for some unheard of amount of funding. I am simply \nasking we provide the funding we promised our schools 2 years ago. As \neveryone knows, the No Child Left Behind Act increased accountability \nfor schools so we can ensure that all of our children will receive a \nhigh-quality education. However, accountability is a two-way street. We \ncannot demand that schools follow all of these new mandates and look \nthe other way when it is time to write a check. If we expect our \nschools to uphold their part of the bargain, then we have to do our \npart and fund these requirements.\n  Let's not forget, the funding levels in the No Child Left Behind Act \nwere based on a bipartisan agreement on what it would take to implement \nthis new law. It is hard to believe we are here 2 years later and the \nFederal Government is still not doing its part.\n  This is especially important today because States are now confronting \nthe true cost of implementing this law. The only study that looked at \nthe actual cost to the States of the No Child Left Behind Act was \nconducted in Ohio. That analysis estimates that the cost to Ohio of \ncomplying with the law will reach $1.447 billion annually by fiscal \nyear 2010.\n  Again, the President's budget request and this Republican budget fail \nto live up to the promises we made in this Senate just 2 years ago when \nwe passed No Child Left Behind. That is why we need to pass this \namendment today. This amendment adds $8.6 billion to function 500 to \nfully fund the No Child Left Behind Act and to improve overall funding \nfor educational programs.\n  I am sure we will hear those on the other side saying their budget \nincreases funding for No Child Left Behind by $1.2 billion over last \nyear. It does. But it is still $8.6 billion short of what our schools \nneed. That shortfall is going to have real and painful effects on all \nof our students unless we fix this budget.\n  Mr. President, 4.6 million low-income children in this country will \nnot get the help they need under title I unless we pass this amendment. \nIn my home State alone, the difference between the President's request \nand the promise of No Child Left Behind means 28,000 low-income \nstudents will be left behind.\n  This budget will result in fewer students being served by a number of \nimportant programs. That is because the Republican budget freezes \nfunding for programs but those freezes mean real cuts in service when \nyou factor in that we have rising enrollment and costs to our schools. \nAt the end of the day, the Republican budget will mean that fewer \nstudents will be served in impact aid, dropout prevention, school \ncounseling, afterschool, teacher quality, migrant education, and rural \neducation.\n\n  Let me give one example of what those cuts mean for our students. \nThis budget will leave nearly 20,000 children in Washington State alone \nand 1.4 million children nationwide without a safe, adult-supervised \nenvironment\n\n[[Page S2470]]\n\nafter school. We can do better. My amendment shows how.\n  My amendment will live up to the commitments we made to our students \nwhen the No Child Left Behind Act was passed. It fully funds programs \nsuch as title I, English language acquisition, afterschool, and rural \neducation. If this amendment passes, more than 2 million additional \nneedy children will be served by title I, as we promised, when we \npassed No Child Left Behind.\n  My amendment will mean more than 38,000 children in Washington State \nand 1.4 million students nationwide will have access to safe, adult-\nsupervised afterschool programs.\n  My amendment is also fiscally responsible because it also asks for \n$8.6 billion in deficit reduction, something many of our colleagues \nhave talked about.\n  Our priority should be educating our students. This amendment \nreflects that priority because both the education increase and deficit \nfunding reduction are taken by closing tax loopholes. During the debate \non my amendment, I suspect we will hear a whole list of reasons why we \ncannot give our kids the funding we promised them. I want to debunk \nsome of those plans right now.\n  We will hear some argue that we have already increased funding for \neducation to a high enough level. I say to any one of my colleagues, go \nto your local schools in your communities and ask them if they agree \nwith that. See what type of reaction you get. Let's remember, we have \nnever fully funded the No Child Left Behind Act--never. How can we ask \nour schools today to comply with the law when we are not holding up our \nend of the bargain?\n  Let's not forget that the only reason we have reached this level of \nfunding is because many in Congress pushed and pushed last year to do \nbetter than the President's budget. If we had accepted the President's \nfunding request, there would be at least $10.7 billion less for \neducation than was appropriated by Congress and $6.6 billion less for \nNo Child Left Behind.\n  Another claim we will hear during this debate is that if my amendment \nis accepted, we will come back and ask for more funding next year. That \nis exactly what the law called for when we passed it. The requirements \non our schools ratchet up throughout the lifetime of this bill, \nincluding requirements to increase test scores and to have an increased \nnumber of highly qualified teachers that we require under the law. That \nis why the funding in the bill was slated to increase annually as well \nand why we are now falling further and further behind as we fail to \nlive up to that commitment. That is why we are hearing from our \nteachers in our schools today. As parts of this law become implemented, \nthey have to live up to them.\n  If my amendment is accepted, the request for fiscal year 2006 will \nnot have to play catchup again as we have done for the past 2 fiscal \nyears.\n\n  Finally, we will hear opponents argue that States and schools do not \nreally need all of this funding. I disagree. The bottom line is that \nour schools do not need more excuses from Washington, DC. They need the \nfunding we promised and my amendment will provide it.\n  As I conclude, I want to be very clear what is at stake. This \namendment will determine whether we keep the funding promises we all \nmade when we voted for No Child Left Behind. Those who vote against \nthis amendment will have to explain to parents and teachers and \nstudents and families and communities they represent why they refused \nto provide the funding we promised in the No Child Left Behind Act.\n  If any of my colleagues want to argue against fully funding No Child \nLeft Behind, that of course is their right, but I will fight with \neverything I have to give our schools the funding we promised so this \nlaw can work. Our students deserve nothing less.\n  I urge my colleagues to stand up with all of us who are working hard \nto make that law work for all of our students. I urge my colleagues to \nvote for the Murray amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington for \noffering this amendment. She offered it in the committee. This is one \nof the most important amendments we will vote on during the \nconsideration of the budget resolution. The Senator from Washington has \nbeen a strong leader on education issues.\n  If we are going to have a competitive country for the future, if we \nare going to do something about this job loss that is occurring, we \nhave to have the best educated, best trained workforce in the world. \nThat is the message the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board has sent \nto Congress and to the United States.\n  Senator Murray is saying, we ought to put our money where our mouth \nis, that we ought to keep the promise of No Child Left Behind, not just \nsend all the requirements out to the States but send the money along \nwith it that was promised in order to provide the resources necessary \nto make these promises a reality.\n  I again thank the Senator from Washington for her leadership.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington controls the time.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nMaryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington \nState. I enthusiastically rise in support of her amendment to fully \nfund No Child Left Behind.\n  This is the 21st century. In our own country, we have to make sure we \nare safer, that we have a stronger, more competitive economy. The way \nwe are going to be safer and stronger is if we get smarter. By \n``smarter,'' I mean develop a 21st century workforce. In order to do \nthat, we need to make sure our elementary, middle, and high schools are \nthe best they can be.\n  This is why I support full funding of No Child Left Behind. We need \nto focus on achievement. We need to focus on accountability. But while \nwe are looking to hold our public schools accountable, we need to hold \nourselves accountable in order to bring the resources to our public \nschools.\n  Requirements without resources are an unfunded Federal mandate. If we \nwant to have a smarter workforce, we need to get behind our public \nschools. The Murray amendment really takes us a long way in making sure \nwe have smaller class sizes, better trained teachers, and all the other \nresources that go into that.\n  College is also an important part of being smarter. I am deeply \ntroubled that access to college, which has been one part of the \nAmerican dream, could now become part of the American financial \nnightmare. I will be offering an amendment later on to help families \nwho want to send their children to college: a simple, straightforward \n$4,000 tuition tax credit for every year of college.\n  Our middle-class families are stressed and stretched. Families in my \nown State of Maryland are worried. They are worried about jobs. They \nare worried about losing their health care, with costs ballooning. They \nare worried about holding down more than one job to make ends meet. \nThey race from carpools to work and afterschool activities and back \nagain. But most of all, they want to know can they count on their \npublic schools, which is what Senator Murray is defending. They want to \nknow will their children be able to go to college.\n  I believe the United States of America should provide an opportunity \nladder and we need to make sure one of the rungs in that ladder is \naccess. That is why I believe a $4,000 tuition tax credit will go a \nlong way toward giving help to those who practice self-help--the \nfamilies who are working and saving to send their children to college, \nand young people who are working and saving to send themselves to \ncollege.\n\n  Tuition is on the rise at colleges. At my own University of Maryland, \nthere has been a 30-percent increase over the last 2 years. Tuition for \nBaltimore Community College rose by $300 in 1 year. The average cost of \na 4-year public college is about $10,500. If you add the fees and \neverything, at University of Maryland it is about $14,000. Those are \nnot numbers. Those are real costs to real families.\n  Financial aid, though, is not keeping up with the rising costs. \nToday, Pell grants only cover 40 percent of the average costs at 4-year \npublic colleges. Twenty years ago, it covered 80 percent of the costs.\n\n[[Page S2471]]\n\n  Our students are graduating with so much debt it is becoming their \nfirst mortgage. Families and students are looking for help. But I \nregret to say President Bush's budget does not offer them much hope.\n  The Republican budget has all the wrong priorities. It freezes the \nPell grants. It does not offer real tax breaks. Yet at the same time it \ngives tax breaks to those who do not need them.\n  We need to do more. We need to help middle-class families have the \nbest education out of our public schools to get them ready for college. \nBut when they are ready to go to college, there should be the financial \nhelp to get them there.\n  We need to double the Pell grant. We need a larger tuition tax \ncredit. We also need to make sure families have access to the American \ndream.\n  College education is more important than ever. Forty percent of the \nnew jobs for the new century will require postsecondary education. This \ncannot happen with platitudes. It has to happen with programs. To \ncompete in the global economy, we have to make sure all of our young \npeople have 21st century skills. In order to compete in the new world \norder, we need to make sure all of our children have 21st century \nskills for 21st century jobs. We need to remember the benefits of \neducation accrue not only to the individual but to society as well.\n  I stand here with my colleagues to say, if we are going to make \ninvestments, we need to invest in human capital, to create a world-\nclass workforce. Let's have the best public schools the world has ever \nseen and make sure we continue to have access to the American dream.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Maryland.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, will the Senator be willing to yield for \na question?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Yes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. First, I see my friend and colleague from Montana wants \nto address the Senate. I would like to comment after he concludes. But \nI first of all want to thank the good Senator from Washington for \noffering this amendment.\n  There is varied experience that is brought to the Senate by Members \nof this body. But we are listening to a voice who has been a teacher \nand also a school board member, and prior to entering the Senate \nprobably spent more time in the area of education, particularly young \nchildren, certainly, than any other Member of this body.\n  When she speaks about education and what happens in the classrooms \nand to the teachers, she is talking on the basis of a lifetime \nexperience. She makes a compelling case. I welcome the opportunity to \njoin with her.\n  I want to take a moment of the Senate's time and ask whether the kind \nof situation we are facing in Massachusetts is typical of what she is \nfinding in her State or if she has heard about it in other States.\n  In my own State of Massachusetts, we passed effectively a ``no child \nleft behind'' bill 4 years prior to the time we passed it here in the \nSenate. As a result, over a 7-year period, we find Massachusetts is No. \n1 in the country in the fourth grade and No. 1 in the eighth grade. We \nreduced the disparities with regard to race more than any other State. \nIt is because of those accepted concepts which the Senator from \nWashington has talked about: smaller class size, well-trained teachers, \nsupplementary services, parental involvement, evaluation of the \nchildren themselves, and support from the local communities.\n  These are the things for which she has fought. But when you fail to \ndo that--I have here before me a copy of the Boston Globe newspaper of \nFebruary 19, which talks about what is happening in the region: ``Deep \nCut in School Systems Taking a Toll on Educators.'' It lists school \nsystems feeling the effects because of the cutbacks, because of the \nfailure of us to provide for No Child Left Behind, plus what is \nhappening in the State.\n  Boston has lost 396 teachers. They have closed six schools. They have \ncut the budgets on individual schools and eliminated programs.\n  For Braintree, they have lost 56 teachers and increased class sizes.\n  Bridgewater-Raynham Regional has lost 35 teachers, increased class \nsizes, added a $175 bus fee, $200 athletic fee, and a $50 \nextracurricular fee, being paid by parents.\n  Fitchburg lost 47 teachers, increased class sizes, added a $180 \nannual bus fee, and raised the athletic fees from $30 to $40.\n  Haverhill lost 143 teachers, closed 6 schools, increased class sizes, \neliminated full-day kindergarten, added a $250 music fee, and raised \nathletic fees from $50 to $300. As we all know, in education, if the \nchild works in music for 3 to 4 years, their average goes up 50 to 75 \npoints in their test to go on to college.\n  The list goes on.\n  Lynn lost 85 teachers, closed 3 schools, eliminated full-day \nkindergarten and prekindergarten.\n  Pittsfield lost 51 teachers, increased class sizes, eliminated \nafterschool programs, added a $100 student activity fee.\n  Let me read this and ask whether this is something the Senator has \nseen. Here we have this extraordinary superintendent, Thomas \nGiancristiano, who has been in education for 30 years.\n\n  Let me read from the story:\n\n       On good nights, the superintendent fretted. On the bad \n     nights sleep vanished. Hours before dawn, thousands of \n     dollars and cents reeled in his head. Thomas Giancristiano \n     would lie in his bed in his Peabody home, eyes open and red, \n     and make deals with the school finance devil.\n       How many custodians do we need, the Winthrop superintendent \n     would ask. How many secretaries? If we keep the libraries \n     closed, can we keep one more kindergarten teacher?\n\n  That is what is happening out in the schools. Men and women who have \nworked a lifetime trying to educate our children, this is what they are \ngoing through.\n  Going back to the article, he then saw the cutbacks that took place \nin his school district:\n\n       It was a hard moment to watch: A confident, likeable, \n     optimist with 30 years of education experience was faced with \n     cutting 17 teaching jobs. He chose instead to cut himself.\n       Giancristiano's voice was steady, his pique never showing. \n     Only his reddening eyes displayed his anger.\n       ``Either you do not support me, or you do not support your \n     children,'' he read from notes.\n\n  This is happening across the country. This is what this budget is all \nabout. We have a chance to do something for these schools or we can \nprovide the additional kinds of tax breaks for the wealthiest \nindividuals.\n  The amendment of the Senator from Washington is responsible because \nit pays for itself and also helps reduce the deficit. I commend the \nSenator. I intend to speak longer, but I am just wondering, since I \nlistened to the Senator speak and since she is back home every weekend \ntalking to parents and schoolteachers and superintendents, whether the \nkind of stories I mentioned very briefly are happening in her State and \nare having a similar kind of impact on the men and women who have \ndevoted their lives to provide greater educational opportunity to \nchildren in the State of Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts \nfor defining for all of us what I think we are seeing across our \ncountry in every school and every classroom where the morale among our \neducators who are responsible for caring for our children every day has \ndeclined dramatically.\n  The Senator will remember not that long ago when the Senate passed a \nbill to increase class sizes in kindergarten, first, and second grades. \nAs I traveled around my State at that time, teachers were so \nenthusiastic. They were excited about being given the opportunity to \nhelp their young students learn to write and learn to do math so they \ncould be successful in life.\n  That atmosphere has changed dramatically. Now you travel around to \nclassrooms and they are begging and pleading for help. Every teacher \nsays to me: I want to do the right thing. I want to be accountable. I \nwant my students to be able to succeed. I want to make this work. But \nmy class size is twice as large. I get less time with parents. I am \npaying more out of my own pocket for basic supplies. We don't have \nenough books for all of our students. And even more so, I am spending\n\n[[Page S2472]]\n\nevery single second teaching to this test because my students don't \nhave art and music and other things that help them be well-rounded \nadults.\n  We can change this. We can make it better. We can do what we promised \n2 years ago and fund this and really make a difference in our \nchildren's lives.\n  I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his question. I yield 10 \nminutes to the Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank my good friend from Washington.\n  Mr. President, I don't know what the debate is all about. This is a \nno-brainer. It is an absolute no-brainer. All of us, when we are home \ntalking to our teachers and to our communities, to school boards, know \nthis is the right thing to do. It is clear. There is no contest. There \nis no debate.\n  Congress passed No Child Left Behind trying to set levels of \naccountability. But then Congress did not provide the money to \nimplement No Child Left Behind. It is contributing to all the cutbacks \nin our elementary and secondary schools about which we are hearing. I \nhear this constantly at home. I daresay that every Member of the \nSenate, when he or she returns home, finds the same comments.\n  Again, I don't know why we are debating this amendment. It is pretty \nclear. I highly compliment the Senator from Washington. I don't know \nanybody who believes more and has spent more personal time helping to \neducate our Nation's children than the Senator from Washington, who is \na schoolteacher. She is right. We should take our cues from what she is \ntelling us.\n  There is another reason to vote for this amendment. How are we paying \nfor it? Closing tax loopholes. That in and of itself should be enough \nto pass the amendment. Also, we are closing tax loopholes to do \nsomething that is good; that is, supporting education.\n  Education truly is a means of developing our greatest assets. We have \nbuilt the strongest, the most diverse economy on the planet, basically \nthrough education. There is more mobility, more opportunity in America, \nand one reason is our educational system.\n  We have pushed the technology horizon. We have developed a quality of \nlife that is the envy of much of the world. There is no doubt that we \ncan further improve our economy and our quality of life. But it is \nimportant to note that it is the investment in education that has \nessentially brought us to where we are, and it is an ongoing \ninvestment. You cannot stop investing in education. You have to keep \ngoing for obvious reasons.\n  Fully funding No Child Left Behind is a no-brainer. It is obvious we \nshould do this. Our people back home want us to do it. If you took a \npoll at home, should No Child Left Behind be paid for, the results \nwould be overwhelming because people at home know what a tight spot \nelementary and secondary education is in.\n  We are not giving our children our best shot. We have a moral \nresponsibility to leave this place in as good a shape or better than we \nfound it. That applies to the environment, education, the general \nconditions in which the America public finds itself. It is unfortunate \nin a certain sense--we are kind of lucky in another--that we have to \naccelerate our support for education. Why? Because the world is \nchanging so quickly. New technologies are developing worldwide so \nquickly. We, therefore, have an obligation to accelerate our emphasis \non education generally, and that is at all levels. It is Head Start, \nelementary and secondary, continuing, 4-year colleges, graduate \neducation. It is at all levels.\n  Clearly, a key part of that is No Child Left Behind. So far this \nadministration is giving words to the concept. It says vote for No \nChild Left Behind, but it has not backed it up with dollars.\n  A Presidential candidate years ago once asked: Where is the beef? I \nwill ask the same question: Where is the beef? Where is the support? \nWhere is the funding?\n\n  We have an opportunity to assist our children by providing them with \nthe necessary resources to help them meet the challenge. Under No Child \nLeft Behind, Montana was promised $71 million in 2005 to comply with \nthe new educational standards. What does this budget include? Half of \nthat, $46 million, and that is a shortfall. Add to that all the other \npressures schools are facing.\n  Again, this is a no-brainer. I compliment the Senators from \nWashington and Massachusetts. Both of them work very hard for \neducation.\n  Jack Kennedy once said:\n\n       Our progress as a Nation can be no swifter than our \n     progress in education.\n\n  I think we all agree. Funding education is key to maintaining an \nAmerican workforce that can compete in the world economy. Education is \ncritical to keeping jobs and creating new jobs in the United States. A \nbig problem we know is the offshoring of American jobs. It is very \nserious. We deserve to give it an answer.\n  I don't believe the answer has been given to us thus far by this \nadministration. We have heard nothing. It is laissez-faire: Let things \nhappen. So what if people lose their jobs. It is good in the long term. \nThat is essentially what the administration is saying.\n  I believe in order to keep our country strong we have to do something \npositive. We have to take some action. We must advance policies to help \ncreate new jobs in the United States, undertake measures designed to \nkeep good-paying jobs in the United States.\n  Finally, when jobs are lost in trade, we need to retrain workers and \nhelp them get back in the workforce as quickly as possible. That is why \nI believe it is right that one of the priority amendments on this side \nof the aisle addresses jobs. It is why at the appropriate time I will \noffer an amendment that will set us as a country on the path to \naccomplishing those goals.\n  We must begin where the jobs begin. We must adopt policies to create \njobs in America. One of the best ways to do that is by supporting \nresearch. Most of the innovative research done in the United States is \nat universities and research institutes which attract students from \nacross the globe. Over the last 20 years, Federal research funding in \nthe physical sciences and engineering as a percentage of GDP has \nactually declined. It has declined by nearly one-third. I believe we \nshould reverse that trend, increase Federal spending on basic research. \nThe money we spend will come back to us many times over in the creation \nof new jobs and new industries making products yet to be invented.\n\n  If we want to support Federal spending on research, we should support \nthe National Science Foundation. The NSF funds research and education \nin science and engineering through a variety of successful programs. It \naccounts for roughly 20 percent of all Federal support to academic \ninstitutions for basic research, a crucial engine of innovation for our \neconomy.\n  NSF funds have helped discover new technologies that have led to \nmultibillion-dollar industries and created countless new jobs. The list \nis astounding: fiber optics, radar, wireless communication, \nnanotechnology, plant genomics, magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound, \nand, yes, the Internet. All were made possible by work in the basic \nsciences and engineering funded by the NSF.\n  Each year, the NSF helps fund over 200,000 students, teachers, and \nresearchers. Many of these people take their NSF-supported work into \nindustry, where they found company startups selling new products and \nnew technologies. That means one thing: jobs. Fully funding NSF will \nlead to more jobs.\n  When the President signed the National Science Foundation \nAuthorization Act of 2002, the intent was to double in 5 years the \nfunding devoted to the NSF. Not fully funding NSF shortchanges \nAmerica's future.\n  The amendment I am offering will fulfill the promise of the NSF Act \nand restore funding to its fully authorized levels. That means \nproviding $7.4 billion in fiscal year 2005, $8.5 billion in 2006, and \n$9.8 billion in 2007. All told, that is $7.4 billion above current \nlevels--certainly money well spent.\n  Our future depends upon our ability to continue to innovate, and that \ndepends upon the support we give to America's innovators--our \nscientists and engineers. We should fully fund the NSF.\n  At the same time, we must ensure America's families can afford higher \neducation, which is an important part of the solution. This is the key \nto America's continued prosperity. Education provides the skills \nnecessary to unleash the creativity of our citizens.\n\n[[Page S2473]]\n\n  We should improve, consolidate, and expand the educational tax \nincentives that already exist and make them more effective. There are \nmany ways.\n  We can expand and extend the deduction for tuition expenses, expand \nthe Hope and lifetime learning credits, craft targeted incentives for \nstudent pursuing science and engineering careers, and focus on programs \nto make it possible for nontraditional students to obtain an education. \nThese are all good options.\n  We need to ensure that young Americans are not discouraged from \nobtaining postsecondary education because of costs. That is the \nAmerican dream, to get an education. We should not discourage it. \nTuition costs have risen considerably in recent years, and our Federal \nassistance programs have not kept up.\n  Increasing tax incentives can help to lessen the burden on students, \nand allow students to attend the schools that best fit their needs, \nwhether 4-year colleges or 2-year colleges, which can also provide \nvocational and technical training.\n\n  I ask for an additional 2 minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Off of the Senator's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 2 additional \nminutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Different students will opt for different types of \ntraining. That is good. We need workers with different skills to fill \nall the new jobs that are constantly being created.\n  One thing is sure: We need to train more engineers. Listen to this, \nMr. President. We train only half as many engineers as does Japan. We \ntrain only half as many engineers as does Europe. We train only a third \nas many as does China. Think how many engineers China is going to train \nnext year and the year after that and the year after that. Where will \nwe be? Engineers play a critical role in the development of new jobs \nand new industries. We should encourage students to pursue training in \nthis vital field.\n  We need to help displaced workers to receive the retraining needed to \nsucceed in a changing economy. There is one thing they can be sure of: \nThings will always change. Jobs will change. Workers should be equipped \nwith the tools to change with these jobs. Education is certainly the \nkey.\n  The amendment I am going to offer will put a downpayment of $10 \nbillion into our workforce. The U.S. economy is the most flexible, \nvibrant, dynamic in the world. We have to keep it that way. We owe that \nto the ingenuity of the American people and their relentless thirst to \ncreate and innovate.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in a positive response to offshoring. \nIt should not be negative; it should not be protectionism. It has to be \npositive. I am offering a sound, positive approach. Create jobs in \nAmerica by fully funding the National Science Foundation and support \neducation. That is one of the keys to our long-term prosperity.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, before my friend and colleague from \nMontana leaves, I want to say this amendment increases taxes by $17.2 \nbillion. It increases taxes next year by $13.2 billion.\n  For the information of colleagues, we are assuming next year, on the \nreconciliation, which is all that is going to happen this year--or \nmaybe all that will happen--that is the total child credit, it so \nhappens. Some people say, well, this is assuming revenue loophole \nclosings. That is not accurate. This resolution says increased taxes by \n$17.2 billion. We are assuming that the child credit is going to stay \nat $1,000 per child. So these two are in direct conflict. I want \neverybody to know this is a big spending increase in an area where we \nalready have big spending increases--enormous, if you go over the last \nfew years.\n  In spite of that, it is a big tax increase. In fact, it is a lot \nbigger tax increase than the amendment we voted on yesterday. I want \npeople to know this is a tax increase that is very large.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Yes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Will the Senator read the first line of the description \nof this amendment?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I am reading the amendment where it says offered by \nSenator Murray and ``on line''----\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Above that, further up.\n  Mr. NICKLES. The purpose?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Yes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. It says, ``by closing tax loopholes.''\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Does the Senator disagree that we should close tax \nloopholes?\n  Mr. NICKLES. But that is not what this amendment does. That is the \npurpose. The amendment says: ``On page 3, line 10, increase the amount \nby $13.2 billion.'' That is increasing taxes, an instruction to the \nFinance Committee.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. By closing tax loopholes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senators all address each other through \nthe Chair.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The purpose is to close tax loopholes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma has the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I have the floor. I want to make sure my colleague knows \nhow to understand what these amendments say. If you read lines 1, 2, 3, \nand 4, that increases taxes by $17.2 billion over the resolution. Our \nresolution assumes continuation of the existing tax law. So this would \nincrease taxes by $17.2 billion over existing law.\n  All we are assuming, frankly, in the big amount we have for next \nyear, since that is the bulk of our tax increase, it happens to be for \nthe child credit. So I am telling my colleagues, we talk about closing \nloopholes--and there are some out there. I know the chairman and \nranking member are trying to do that with the leasing provision. I \nhappen to support that. But you are spending it as well.\n  This resolution says increase taxes. The purpose doesn't make law; \nthe purpose doesn't change the resolution. You can put anything up \nthere. You could have as a purpose to make everybody feel good and to \nhave nice incomes in education. That can be your purpose. But when you \nare amending the budget resolution, you are saying how much money to \nspend and how much money to tax. This resolution says to raise taxes by \n$17.2 billion and raise spending by $8.6 billion.\n  I might also say that it raises spending by $8.6 billion in the first \nyear. One would think you would not do that for 1 year and drop it \ndown. So you can assume it would be 8.6 for a multitude of years. This \nis really like a $100 billion amendment on the spending side over 10 \nyears, and then on the tax side, I don't know how many. If you multiply \nthis out over the years, it increases taxes by 17.2 and spending by \n8.6.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. If the Senator will yield, the only way to close tax \nloopholes is by raising additional revenue. That is the only way you \ncan do it. There is no way to close loopholes otherwise. Does the \nSenator agree that he will work with me in closing loopholes and if not \nby raising revenue in some other way? The purpose of the amendment is \nto raise revenue by closing tax loopholes. I assume the Senator agrees \nwith me that is the best way we should raise the revenue, although \ntechnically we have to have the numbers in here; otherwise, the \namendment serves no purpose.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I enjoy working with my colleague from \nMontana on the Finance Committee, and I am one who is more than willing \nto close loopholes. I also tell my colleagues that my friend from \nMontana and the Senator from Iowa have used almost every loophole \ncloser, multiple times.\n  I am happy to close loopholes, but this amendment does not close \nloopholes. This amendment tells the Finance Committee to raise taxes by \n$17.2 billion, period. The Finance Committee can do it any way they \nwant. I am just telling the Senator that is exactly what it says.\n  What we have assumed is we are going to allow the child tax credit to \ngo forward. Maybe that is not a correct assumption. Maybe families are \nnot going to get to keep the present tax law. Maybe the child tax \ncredit will be reduced from $1,000 to $700. Maybe the marriage penalty \nrelief we have in the year 2004 will not happen in 2005. I am afraid, \nif this amendment is adopted, it will not happen.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Not just yet. My point is--and I have not even alluded \nto the\n\n[[Page S2474]]\n\neducation issue, and I am going to hand that to Senator Gregg who knows \nfar more about education than this Senator--no matter what level we had \nin this resolution, I was more than confident somebody would say that \nis not enough for education. I have looked at the total education \nfunction we have, and it totals $97.6 billion. That does not include \nthe additional $5 billion--yes, it does. That includes the $5 billion \nSenator Gregg has put in for higher education reauthorization.\n  I looked at what we spent. That is $97 billion. In 1990, we spent $39 \nbillion, almost three times as much. In the year 2000, we spent $49 \nbillion. It is right at twice as much as we spent in the year 2000. We \nhave had dramatic increases in education--dramatic increases--including \nthe last several years. But no matter what that amount is, people are \ngoing to say that is not enough and, oh, yes, we want to increase taxes \na lot more and throw a lot more money at it. I am just not sure that is \nthe correct result we should be following.\n  I want everybody to know this is a tax increase. I want everybody to \nknow this is a humongous increase in this program. I have not figured \nthe percentage.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. NICKLES. With this additional money, it is a 40.6-percent \nincrease. For everybody who says we want to balance the budget, how do \nyou balance the budget and simultaneously increase programs by 40 \npercent? This fictitious point of let's close loopholes, if there are \nloopholes out there, I am sure the chairman and the ranking member of \nthe Finance Committee want to close them because they have a lot of \ndemands. I am all for closing loopholes, but that doesn't fly. The \namendment says raise taxes by $17.2 billion.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington controls the time.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield to the Senator from Louisiana 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized for \n10 minutes.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I thank my friend \nfrom Washington.\n  I wanted to ask the Senator from Oklahoma, before he leaves, since he \nhas gone on record several times this morning as to what loopholes he \nwould agree to close, would he for the record indicate or give us some \nidea what some of those loopholes would be and how much money could be \ngenerated by those loopholes, because there are many people in \nOklahoma, Louisiana, Massachusetts, and Washington who would be \ninterested in identifying those dollars so we could apply them to \nfulfill the promise the President made to fund education. As the Budget \nchairman, I am very interested in what specific loopholes he would be \nwilling to close.\n  Mr. NICKLES. To answer my colleague's question, in the budget \nresolution we assume $20 billion of revenue loopholes and that, \nfrankly, is to pay for the tax cuts we have in this bill.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Can I clarify? The loopholes the Senator from Oklahoma \nis supporting are going to fund additional tax cuts for those at the \nhigher end of the tax cuts?\n  Mr. NICKLES. The Senator is absolutely incorrect. The loopholes we \nare closing basically will pay for extending present law. What we \nassumed in this budget resolution is continuation of present law, plus \nthe AMT fix.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator from Oklahoma. I have the floor. I \nwant to make clear for the record, as the Senator from Oklahoma just \nclarified, he and the administration are willing to close loopholes, \nbut only if the savings from those loopholes go to make permanent the \ntax cuts that drain the education budget and leave our children at \nrisk. I am glad we got that cleared up.\n  Let me begin the remarks I wish to make this morning.\n  The Senators from Massachusetts and Washington are absolutely correct \nabout the dire situation in our States and communities all across the \nNation. They are also correct that one of the strongest aspects of the \nAmerican dream--and I could argue the strongest aspect of the American \ndream--is the dream parents have for their children, the dream \nAmericans share that no matter how tough their life has been, no matter \nhow shortchanged they might have been when they started, they work hard \nbecause they want their children to get the kind of education that will \nhelp them be the human beings parents dream their children can and \nshould be and to make their communities stronger.\n  When this administration took office, they noted that dream. The \nPresident said:\n\n       The time has come for excuse making to end. With this No \n     Child Left Behind Act, we have committed the Nation to higher \n     standards for every public school, and we have committed the \n     resources necessary to help children achieve those standards. \n     We want accountability with results, and we are willing to \n     fund it.\n\n  That is what was said, but is not what was done. Budgets are \ndifficult to put together. This document does not look very thick, but \nthis document is a blueprint. This document sets a course for the \nNation. This document, if it is not written correctly, cannot meet the \npromises I have just described.\n\n  You know what, Mr. President, this document does not meet that \npromise. This document does not provide the money promised to every \nGovernor, every superintendent, every teacher, and every parent in this \nNation. This document is short $9 billion, and not one Senator on the \nother side is willing to close one loophole to fill that hole. They are \nonly willing to close loopholes to give more tax cuts. That is the \ndebate on this floor, and that is the choice the American people are \ngoing to make in the next election.\n  With the surplus disappearing, with the war at hand, with the war on \nterrorism perhaps escalating, the question is, Do we want to make some \nadjustments in our plans to provide tax cuts or do we want to provide \nsome tax cuts and fund education, invest in homeland security, and \nsupport our troops? That is the issue. But this administration, faced \nwith the facts of declining and evaporating surpluses, faced with the \nfacts of a war that is costing more than we anticipated, faced with \nthose facts, chooses to ignore the facts and put out a budget that goes \nstraight dead ahead 100 miles an hour into deficits and in doing so \nrobs the opportunity, pulls the rug out from under every \nsuperintendent, every Governor, and every teacher because they are \nstruggling in the schools.\n  This is what the President says, but this is not what he does. This \nis what the President says:\n\n       Once failing schools are identified, we will help them \n     improve. We'll help them help themselves. Our goal is to \n     improve public education. We want success, and when schools \n     are willing to accept the reality that the accountability \n     system points out and are willing to change, we will help \n     them.\n\n  We are doing this in Louisiana. We have received accountability. We \nhave identified our schools which are failing. We believed the \nPresident, but when we turned to him to ask him and this administration \nto help us hire new teachers, help us to train the teachers who need to \nbe certified by a date certain the President and the administration \nforced us to do in this act, when we asked them please help us put on \ntwo new classrooms in these schools because we have to meet these new \ngoals, they said we do not have any money, because he wants to extend \nthe tax cuts permanently. He will close the loopholes, but not for \nthem. Sorry, kids, we cannot close the loopholes. I have to close the \nloopholes for people who need tax cuts.\n  Now I am going to talk about the increases in education. I know \nSenator Kennedy is going to speak about this and he knows these numbers \nbetter than I do. I will admit, and I understand and know--so don't \nanybody bother coming to the floor to tell me I do not understand--\nthere is increased funding in education. I am clear and so are the \npeople in my State that the Federal Government has increased funding. \nThat is not the point. The point is, the increases have not been what \nthe administration promised and do not help us meet the new goals that \nhave been mandated on every county and every parish in this Nation.\n  I will also say, if the Senator from New Hampshire wants to come to \nthe floor and debate this issue--and as Senator Murray knows very \nwell--the increase in education in 2001, which was\n\n[[Page S2475]]\n\nthe last budget of the previous administration, was 19 percent. That is \nhow much the increase was. The next year is 2002, which was 18 percent. \nIn the years of the President's budget, which is right here--this is \nthe administration's budget and this is the chairman's mark. The \nchairman's mark is a little different than the President but it is \nbasically the same document. These are the increases they provide: 19 \npercent, 18 percent, down to 6 percent, 5 percent, and 3 percent. The \noutyears look even bleaker.\n  They put No Child Left Behind basically in here, and as we can see, \nthey pulled the rug out from everybody. That is what this election is \ngoing to be about.\n  I know I only have a couple minutes remaining, but I want to say I \nknow, not because I represent and am a leader from my State and I \ntravel just like Senator Murray does all over her State, how angry \npeople are about this. The front page of the Washington Post yesterday \nissued a poll that says 57 percent of the American people polled all \nover the country do not think the country is going in the right \ndirection.\n  This budget sets the direction, and 57 percent of the people know \nwhat is in this budget, not in every line but they are getting the \ngeneral gist of it. They do not like it, and I do not blame them. There \nare many things it does, but one thing it does is it breaks the promise \nto their kids, and when you start fooling with people's children and \nyou start upsetting the dream people have for their children and their \neducation, there is going to be a repercussion from that.\n  In conclusion, to use the President's own words: The time for excuse-\nmaking has come to an end. We have committed to our schools and our \nchildren. We have said if we ask for accountability and results, the \nFederal Government will be there, will be a reliable partner, and this \nadministration has made different choices.\n  I end with a quote from another President. We have had many great \nPresidents in our history, thank goodness, and we had a great one in \nPresident Kennedy who said:\n\n       I believe we possess all the resources and talents \n     necessary, but the facts of the matter are we have never made \n     the national decisions or marshaled the national resources \n     required for such leadership.\n\n  He was speaking about the space program.\n\n       We have never specified long-range goals on an urgent \n     timetable, or managed our resources and our time so as to \n     insure their fulfillment. . . . [L]et it be clear that I am \n     asking the Congress and the country to accept a firm \n     commitment to a new course of action--a course which will \n     last for many years and carry very heavy costs . . . if we \n     are to go only half way, or to reduce our sights in the face \n     of difficulty . . . it would be better not to go at all.\n\n  That is what I am saying. If we have set a course by this budget, we \nowe it to our parents, to our teachers, and our children to stay the \ncourse, and if we are not ready to go the whole distance, we should not \nhave started. That is the promise that has been broken.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I have been talking with the manager of the \nbill on the Democratic side, and he suggested maybe we should enter \ninto some sort of time agreement on this amendment. I see there are a \nnumber of people on his side who want to speak. Is there something the \nSenator recommends?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would say first to the people on our side, we are now \ngetting in a real jam and we are also getting further toward vote-arama \nin a way I think is probably not something we want to do. I recommend \nwe agree to an additional hour on each side, 2 hours equally divided.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I recognize that probably is a disadvantage \nfor us because the other side has been going now for an hour, and \nalthough we are probably more succinct and more persuasive in less \ntime----\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is what we were counting on.\n  Mr. GREGG. It is still not necessarily a fair division of the time. I \nwould agree to some sort of time limit that gave us a little extra \ntime. If the other side wants to go for an hour and we go for an hour \nand 15 minutes, which would be 2 hours and 15 minutes on this \namendment, that would give them an additional hour--they have already \ndone an hour--and we would get an hour and 15 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Would that be acceptable if we took an additional hour on \nour side and an additional hour and 15 minutes on their side?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. It is acceptable to me.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Is there any additional time that could be available? \nThis is such an important amendment. Could we take an hour and a half?\n  Mr. CONRAD. We had hoped to do this in 2 hours. We have already spent \nan hour, and this would be an additional 2 hours 15 minutes.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I understand.\n  Mr. CONRAD. It would be agreeable on this side.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent that debate on this amendment be \nfor an additional 2 hours and 15 minutes with an hour on the minority \nside and an hour and 15 minutes on the majority side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask that there be no second degrees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Is Senator Reed seeking time?\n  Mr. REED. Yes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will Senator Murray give time off the amendment?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield to the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Murray amendment to \nfully fund the No Child Left Behind Act. This is an important \namendment. It will keep our commitment to educational reform in the \nUnited States.\n  There are two keys to the success of the No Child Left Behind Act: \neffective implementation by the Department of Education and robust \nfunding. Both are presently lacking.\n  Without the needed resources, we will not meet the law's goals of \nclosing achievement gaps and ensuring an excellent education and \nopportunity for all children.\n  When the President signed the No Child Left Behind Act into law 2 \nyears ago, he pledged to support greater Federal investment in \neducation. That pledge has not been kept by this President. He has \nproposed eliminating some of the No Child Left Behind Act programs, \ncutting others and only increasing title 1 by $1 billion. That is over \n$7 billion short of the authorized level of $20.5 billion.\n  The No Child Left Behind Act was a fundamental change in the way we \ndo business. Part of that change was a commitment to fund all of our \naggressive ambitions to help every child succeed. What has been left \nare the requirements on children but insufficient resources for school \nsystems throughout this country to implement them.\n  It is no wonder general assemblies across this country, in Utah, in \nVirginia, Republican assemblies, are revolting against these \nprovisions, not because it is not a good effort at reform. Rather it is \nbecause we have not provided the resources to accomplish the reforms. \nSenator Murray's amendment would provide the needed resources.\n  I believe we have to go ahead and fund these programs, and we will \nnot do so unless the Murray amendment is accepted. I urge support of \nthe Murray amendment. This is not just about giving individual \nopportunity to every child. That is central and crucial. This is also \nabout our economic future. If we do not fully fund education now in the \nelementary and secondary years, we will fall further behind in a very \ncompetitive world economy. This is about giving every child a chance \nand making sure our economy and our society works. I commend the \nSenator for doing that, and I yield the floor to Senator Murray.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the other side is not ready to go. I \nyield to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Fine, if that is the desire. Mr. President, I ask 10 \nminutes on the Murray amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 10 minutes.\n\n[[Page S2476]]\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I mentioned a moment or two earlier what \nis happening in my own State, in Massachusetts, in the school districts \nall across that State, a State that was attempting to enhance \neducational opportunities for the children of Massachusetts. They \nrelied upon the commitment that the Federal Government made a few years \nago, some 3 years ago, to try to complete the commitment of that State, \nin partnership with the Federal Government, in enhancing educational \nopportunities for the children in our State and in States across this \ncountry.\n  The Murray amendment addresses the nature of the commitment that the \nadministration made to not just the Members of the Senate but to the \nchildren and to the parents and to the school districts across the \ncountry; that is, we were going to have reform and the resources to \nmake the reform take hold.\n  What we are talking about is a budget of $2.4 trillion, and the issue \nis can we find $8.6 billion in that $2.4 trillion. Education is either \nimportant or it is not. If we ask families all across this country, \npeople would say, I would think you would be able, in a budget of $2.4 \ntrillion, to find the $8 billion to make sure we are going to fund No \nChild Left Behind. It should not be that big a deal. It is a question \nof priority.\n  The Senator from Washington stated what her priorities are. I agree \nwith them, and I think most families in this country would say we can \nafford that, if it is going to make a difference in the quality of the \neducation of the children of this country.\n  Let's review very quickly the bidding, what has happened in the \nperiod since we passed No Child Left Behind. Since we passed the No \nChild Left Behind bill in 2002, let's be frank about where the funding \nis and where it has come from. When we passed No Child Left Behind, the \nadministration asked for $1.3 billion. We raised that up to $4.8 \nbillion during the period of the negotiation. That legislation would \nnot have passed at $1.3 billion. It would not have passed. I can tell \nyou that. I know that.\n\n  Then the next year the administration came in for less than $1 \nbillion and we were able to raise that up $3 billion more. That is the \nrecord. That is the increase right here, as a result of Democratic \namendments to the appropriations, right there.\n  Last year, in the Omnibus bill, the administration asked for a $900 \nmillion cut and we increased it $1.9 billion.\n  We will hear from the other side, look at the increases we have had \nin this area. They are the result of the amendments from this side. We \nwant to continue it. If you like what we have done, vote for the Murray \namendment.\n  Look at what this amendment does right here.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Not just yet, if I have 10 minutes. I will at the end of \nmy time.\n  Here we are, the cost of the Bush tax cut for those making over \n$337,000 in 2005--$45 billion. It is $45 billion.\n  Look at what the Murray amendment has, $8.6 billion. That is in \naddition to what was added, in terms of the Budget Committee--$8.6 \nbillion. This is $45 billion.\n  The issue is choices. The issue is priorities. The issue is, as a \nmatter of national urgency, is it more important to give $45 billion \nfor those making over $337,000 in 2005, or to provide the full funding \nfor the children of this country? That is the choice. That is the \ndecision we are facing.\n  The Murray amendment says let's get that money. We can certainly \nafford $45 billion--with that budget.\n  Let's look at what happens if we do not do this, if we do not accept \nthe Murray amendment. What is going to be the impact on the children of \nthis country?\n  I tried, in just the couple of minutes, to tell what the human impact \nwas on a superintendent who has for 30 years been committed to \nimproving the quality of the life of the children in his district. He \nwas restless. He couldn't sleep. Finally, rather than face the \nadditional cuts he was going to have to provide in this system, he \nactually resigned. That is happening in schools all across this \ncountry. Those are the real stories. That is what is really happening.\n  If we look at it in the broad sweep of what this means, this chart \ntells it. Under the Bush budget going out the years from 2005 to 2013, \nyou are going to leave 4 million children behind. Under the Murray \namendment and the follow-on, all the children will be addressed; no \nchild will be left behind.\n  I was absolutely amazed, listening to the other side, saying if we go \nand approve the Murray amendment this will be a 40-percent increase. \nImagine that, a 40-percent increase, thinking this body will never go \nfor a 40-percent increase. In fact, even with that, that will only mean \n60 percent of the total funding for No Child Left Behind. We are \nrequiring 100-percent performance by those children. We are expecting \n100-percent performance by the teachers. We are expecting 100-percent \nperformance by those people who are providing the supplementary \nservices, and we in the Congress say you do it on 60 percent of the \nmoney.\n\n  It is like in this Nation, if we passed a voting rights act to apply \nto all of the country and we say it is not going to apply to 10 States. \nWe will have Social Security for America but we are going to leave 10 \nStates out.\n  We really didn't mean it when we said we were going to really address \nthe needs of the 12 million children who fall into the category of \ntitle I. We didn't really mean it for all of them. We said it in the \nbill. We require it in the legislative proposal that in 12 years they \nhave to be proficient--except you are not funding it. What sense does \nthat make?\n  It would have been like President Kennedy saying, you are going to go \nto the Moon, and we appropriate enough money to go up 50 miles and say \nwe have had a success. You either do it or you don't. We were either \nserious at the time when we passed No Child Left Behind, like we were \non voting rights, like we were on Social Security, like we were on \nMedicare, and like we were on going to the Moon. Or we are not. That is \nwhat the issue is. That is what the issue is in the Senate. Either \nchildren have that priority or they do not. The Democrats believe they \ndo.\n  We find there is more than enough money in here right now to be able \nto do it. There is more than enough money in here to be able to do it.\n  I am glad to yield to my friend from New Hampshire if he still has a \nquestion.\n  Mr. GREGG. I will try to recall it.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will be around for a little while. I \nknow there are others who want to speak. I will withhold the remainder \nof the time but I will be around, ready to answer any questions. I \nthank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of the Senators \nsupporting the position represented by Senator Murray. But I do believe \nit is important to understand from where we come and where we are \ngoing, relative to educational spending in this country, and \nspecifically in this Congress, and who is accountable for what. \nBecause, obviously, the representation coming from the other side is \nthat this President and this Republican Congress has not been as \ncommitted to education as we should have been.\n  It is a hard case to make, honestly, in light of the history of \neducational spending.\n  Let us return to the scene of the crime, as they say in the business \nof reviewing evidentiary facts. The scene of the crime is the Clinton \nadministration, its spending on education, and its woeful efforts in \nthe area of special education and title I. The scene of the crime is \nthe Clinton administration and its failure to address the fact that for \ngenerations low-income children had been left behind in this Nation.\n  That is what this is about. You can throw out all the numbers you \nwant. But the issue is whether we as a Nation will continue to abandon \nthe low-income child and leave him or her in school systems which \nsimply shuttle him or her through, meaning when he got to the end of \nhis or her academic career--if you can even call it that--in our school \nsystems, he or she was unable to participate in the American dream \nbecause she couldn't read and he couldn't write relative to their \npeers.\n  The President of the United States, George Bush, came into office and \nhe\n\n[[Page S2477]]\n\nsaid, Let us do something about this. Let us address the issue of the \nfact that so many children in this Nation for generations have been \nshuttled through the system. He proposed the No Child Left Behind Act \nas a way to address that. The No Child Left Behind Act is not only \nabout money in a tangential way. No Child Left Behind is really about \nthe philosophy of whether a low-income child should enter the school \nsystem at a level at which they are not competitive with their peers \nand be left in that school system for the rest of their academic career \nand come out at a level that is not competitive with their peers.\n  The No Child Left Behind Act is an issue of whether we are going to \ntry to take the children in this country who come from a low-income \nfamily and give them a shot at the American dream by bringing their \neducation up to a level where they at least know what they need to know \nin order to participate in our society, which is a very academically \noriented society--a society which depends disproportionately on your \neducational ability in order to obtain success.\n  The President proposed the concept which was to say to local school \ndistricts throughout this country, You decide, school districts, what \nchildren in your school know in the third grade, in the fourth grade, \nin the fifth grade, in the sixth grade, in the seventh grade, or in the \neighth grade. You decide. We as a Federal Government are not going to \ntell you. You go out as a community, you sit down and brainstorm and \ndecide what your fourth graders should know, what level of math, what \nlevel of composition capability, what level of English. Then once you \ndecide that, you set up a process, a regimen, where you evaluate \nwhether the children in your school system are meeting those \nobligations, are meeting those standards, are learning English at the \nlevel and writing and spelling at the level you, the local school \ndistrict, decide is appropriate.\n  One of the key things the President said was don't cover up the low-\nincome child by putting them in a large group with all the other \nchildren in the school system--what is called disaggregation. Let us \nlook at these different groups, whether they come from minority \nbackgrounds, whether they come from low-English backgrounds, or low-\nincome backgrounds. Let us find out what each group of children \nactually is learning.\n  Let us not say just because fourth graders in the school system which \nhas a lot of kids and who come from average income families that are \ndoing well on the scores as a gross number, but that school system is \nworking well when we know for a fact the low-income kids in that school \nsystem are still being left behind--disaggregation.\n  We set up a system. The President proposed a system where we go out \nand say to the local school, You find out, you find out, parents, \nteachers, and principals, what children should learn in these \nelementary school grades and say whether the children by income groups \nor by ethnic groups are learning.\n  Those two ideas were rather radical. But the radical idea was we were \nactually going to tell the parents in the school system whether their \nchildren are being taught, whether they are learning at a level that is \ngoing to bring them up to their peers. Low-income parents--most of \nwhom, by the way, are single parents struggling to make ends meet--are \nfinally going to know whether their children in that school system are \nlearning what is necessary in order to make them competitive as defined \nby that school system and as defined by their peers. If the parent \nfinds out their child is in a school system that is not teaching that \nchild, then we are going to give the parents some tools to try to \ncorrect that problem. We are going to allow public school choice. We \nare going to allow extra help for low-income kids so they can be \nbrought up to speed if they aren't up to speed with their peers. We are \ngoing to allow the school districts to go into schools, which \nunfortunately have systemic failures, or large percentage failures, and \nput more resources into those schools to try to correct their problems.\n  This was the idea. It was revolutionary, and it has fundamentally \nimproved education in this country. Everywhere you go in this country \ntoday, school districts are addressing the issue of whether the \nchildren are learning, whether the low-income kids are learning, \nwhether they are being assessed, and the information is being put out \nto the public and the public is making assessments as to whether it is \nright.\n  This bill has been one of the most creative and aggressive bills we \nhave ever passed as a Congress, or even the States, in the area of \ntrying to correct what has been a fundamental problem in which our \npublic school systems, regrettably for years, were passing low-income \nkids off and not giving them a shot at the American dream. It is \nworking.\n  We incessantly hear from the other side about the failure of the \nbill. Why are we hearing that? Is it really because it has not been \nfunded? No. It is because there is an educational establishment out \nthere which does not like the fact it is being held accountable. This \nisn't about funding. This is a raw attempt by the educational \nestablishment to try to undermine the No Child Left Behind Act law \nbecause they do not like the fact they are being held accountable. They \ndo not like the fact low-income kids are finally getting a chance, are \nfinally learning something, or are being told they have to learn \nsomething.\n  That is what this debate is about. Let us not try to color it with \nmoney because it is not about money. Let us get into the money issue to \nprove that is not the case.\n  If money were the issue, the prior administration would have poured a \nlot more money into this program than they did. They did not. If money \nwere the issue, the school systems in this country would not have \nenough money to do the assessments that are the essence of this whole \nbill. They not only have enough money to do the assessments, but they \nhave more than enough money to do the assessments under this bill. If \nmoney were the issue, the money we have already put in the pipeline \nwould have been spent. There wouldn't be any available.\n\n  What we find is there are literally billions of dollars of money in \nthe pipeline which have not been spent as a result of the fact this law \nhas been aggressively funded.\n  Let me put it in context. The last time the President of this country \nwas a Democrat and the Congress was Democratically controlled was 1995. \nYou would have thought at that time, if you listened to the rhetoric \naround here, title I and the programs under title I which still existed \nat that time--the No Child Left Behind Act obviously wasn't the law--\nwould have been funded right up to the authorization amount. That is \nall we have heard about from the other side on this bill.\n  Surprise. It wasn't. It wasn't even close to the full authorization \namount in 1995. Not only that but the increases which flowed into the \naccount under a prior administration were minuscule in key areas such \nas title I and special education.\n  I heard the good Senator from Massachusetts come down here and say \nall the new money that has gone into title I, or most of it, is the \nresult of the fact they offered amendments on the other side and those \namendments made the changes in these programs and added all of this \nextra money. I appreciate the fact he at least gives credit to this \nadministration for putting a larger amount of new dollars into the \neducation accounts. That is nice, because it is true. There has been a \nhuge infusion of new dollars into the education accounts.\n  This chart shows that in real terms. I appreciate the fact the \nSenator from Massachusetts basically acknowledged it. The last year of \nthe Clinton administration, it was $42.2 billion in education accounts. \nAs of this year, there will be $58.7 billion in education funding, \nwhich shows the rather dramatic increase.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GREGG. I will yield when I finish my statement. I would be happy \nto.\n  If we go to title I, we will see in the last year the Presidency and \nthe Congress were controlled by the Democratic Party, there was $6.7 \nbillion spent on title I. When the Republicans took over the Congress, \nby the way, that started to move up. In the years since President Bush \nhas come into office, that number has jumped dramatically, so we are \nnow up to $13.3 billion being spent on title I.\n\n[[Page S2478]]\n\n  The same is true of IDEA, which is a more startling number because \nthe Clinton administration never proposed increases in IDEA until the \nlast year and they were the result of a Republican Congress forcing \nthose increases into the Clinton administration. Again, the IDEA \nnumbers went down during the first years of the Clinton administration \nand started to go back up when the Republicans took control of the \nCongress. I was very involved when we demanded $1 billion a year. This \nPresident has proposed more increases in the first 3 years in IDEA \nfunding--$1 billion each year onto each prior year--than the Clinton \nadministration proposed in their entire 8 years in office. This is an \nexample of that during the Clinton administration. IDEA funding was \nincreased by $1.4 billion over their 8 years. In three years in office, \nPresident Bush has increased that money by $3.7 billion.\n  It brings me back to a side issue. I found it entertaining that \nbasically if we listen to the Senator from Massachusetts, he said all \nthis new funding which has flowed into the various accounts--and it has \nbeen dramatic, as shown by the first chart, into special education and \ntitle I--it was a function of amendments offered by the Democratic \nleadership and the Democratic membership of this Congress. I point out \nI am not aware the Democratic Party controlled the Congress for these 3 \nyears and it certainly did not control the Presidency, so I am not sure \nhow they managed to do that. The fact is we could not pass the \namendments unless the President agreed to them, signed the bills, and \nthe Republican Congress agreed to them and passed it.\n  What can be pointed out is when the Clinton administration and the \nDemocratic Congress did control the issue of funding, had unilateral \ncontrol of the issue over funding because they had both Houses of \nCongress and the Presidency, their accounts went down. It was not until \na Republican Congress and a Republican Senate made it its No. 1 \npriority under Senator Lott, Senator Specter, and other Members of this \nCongress that we started to see the IDEA funding go back up \ndramatically.\n  This is a very substantive point because it makes the case that what \nwe are hearing from the other side is truly politics, the politics of \neducation, not the substance of education. The substance of education \nis whether a low-income child in America today is better off in the \nsystem than they were 3 years ago. There can be no question but that \nchild is. Finally, after years and years and years, we are finding out \nwhether that child is being educated at the same level as his peers, \nthrough assessment, and when we find that out and if we discover that \nchild is not being educated up to his peers, we put in place systems to \naddress that.\n\n  It is also important while we are on this topic to address the nature \nof this amendment. The amendment does not actually say the funding will \ngo to education. The amendment sets up a reserve fund. The only thing \nthe amendment actually does is raise taxes. It raises taxes by $17 \nbillion and puts that money in an account. That account may or may not \nget spent. What we do know is it will raise taxes.\n  What does $17 billion in new taxes account for? We heard from the \nother side it will go against those wealthy Americans who are making \ntoo much money and we need to tax them some more. That may \nphilosophically be what they want to do, but as a practical matter that \nis not the effect this amendment would have. The proposals which are \nmost at risk today in the tax laws do not impact wealthy Americans; \nthey impact moderate- and middle-income Americans. It is the child tax \ncredit that lapses, it is the marriage tax penalty which goes back into \nplace, and it is the 10-percent bracket which gets kicked back out if \nwe do not extend the tax reductions which are on the books.\n  Ironically, the $17 billion of higher taxes which this amendment is \ngoing to force on the American people is probably going to be borne \nprimarily by people who are married, because the spousal deductions and \nthe marriage tax penalty, if not extended, add up to $15.7 billion, an \nironic joining of numbers but clearly a logical place where it will \noccur. If the $17 billion tax increase occurs, it will occur as a \nresult of these extenders not being put in place. Therefore, the \nspousal tax, which is $15.7 billion and which basically says if you are \nmarried you should not have to pay more than if you were separated, \nwill end up being most likely the place I suspect this tax increase \nwill occur.\n  This amendment is unique in that it does not really impact the \neducation accounts because it puts it into reserve. It does, however, \nraise taxes, and most likely on married people.\n  While we are on the subject of how well funded No Child Left Behind \nis, we should go into some specifics. The No Child Left Behind part of \ntitle I--and what we have are charts that reflect how significantly we \nhave increased funding under title I since President Bush came into \noffice. Over the 8 years President Clinton was in office, he raised the \ndollars into title I by $2.6 billion. In the 3 years since President \nBush has been in office, we have seen a $4.6 billion increase or almost \ntwice as much, at least 70-percent higher funding levels from President \nBush as from President Clinton.\n  The argument is made that is still not enough, that we should be \nfunding this to the full authorized level. I have been around this \nplace for 11 years and I think I understand we do not fund at \nauthorized level and everyone in this institution understands the \nauthorized level is a statement, not a number. It is a goal. But it is \nnot necessarily the goal that will be reached.\n  What proves that beyond any serious doubt is the fact when the \nDemocrats did control both the Presidency, the House and the Senate, \nthey did not fund title I at full authorization. If there is \ncredibility to their argument today, they would have had to have funded \nthe authorization at its full level back when they controlled the \nCongress. But there is not credibility to their argument because they \ndid not do that.\n  In fact, when we look at the level of funding increases that occurred \nduring their administration when they had the Presidency and when they \nheld the Senate, it was pretty much flat funded, and it has only been \nwith President Bush that the dramatic increases in these accounts \nhappen.\n  Do we have enough money in the pipeline to address title I and No \nChild Left Behind? That is an argument we hear a lot about. We do know \nthe number has increased dramatically. States are getting a lot more \nmoney. In fact, a lot of states are not pulling down the full amount \nthey have available to them. We know there is some good anecdotal \ninformation coming in right now that says No Child Left Behind is being \nadequately funded.\n  I was interested to see a recent study by two public officials in \nMassachusetts, one of whom was the Massachusetts State school board \nchairman and another who was a member of the school board in \nMassachusetts. James Peyser is chairman of the Massachusetts Board of \nEducation and Robert Costrell is a professor of economics at the \nUniversity of Massachusetts at Amherst, on leave, and currently serves \nas the chief economist for the Executive Office for Administration and \nFinance.\n  These two gentlemen did a study of how much money was coming in under \nNo Child Left Behind and whether it was adequate. The report says they \nthought there was sufficient money in the pipeline in Massachusetts to \neffectively implement the law.\n  Here are a few things they cite: The $391 million of Federal \nDepartment of Education money that has been set aside specifically to \nadminister the additional State assessments required under No Child \nLeft Behind is more than adequate.\n  That was their conclusion.\n  They did say:\n\n       Although new funding may be needed in the future, the \n     authors observe that ``The needed dollar amounts are \n     relatively small and could be met easily by allocating funds \n     from lower-priority problems.''\n\n  Another finding:\n\n       Shortfalls in federal support of school technical \n     assistance, as required under No Child Left Behind, are small \n     at present but are likely to grow significantly as more \n     schools are found to be in need of improvement. To fill the \n     gap, the authors call for greater flexibility in federal \n     guidelines. ``Much of the gap can be filled,'' Peyser and \n     Costrell explain, ``by allowing states to allocate more of \n     their federal dollars to supporting turnaround efforts in \n     low-performing districts.''\n\n  The estimated cost of testing required by No Child Left Behind runs \nat\n\n[[Page S2479]]\n\n$20 per student, a small fraction of the per-pupil cost in the United \nStates. Today, the per-pupil cost in the United States is $7,392. \nInterestingly enough, if you take the $391 million that the Federal \nDepartment of Education has set aside--and this is not their numbers--\nto do the assessment work, you find it exceeds the $20 by a rather \ndramatic number. I know in New Hampshire, for example, it exceeds it by \na factor of almost 10. In fact, the dollars increased per pupil from \n2000 to 2004 in Federal spending, these two gentlemen discovered, was \nabout $300 per pupil across the country, which certainly far outstrips \nthe cost of the per-pupil testing requirement, which is the primary \nrequirement in this law.\n  So you have folks who are very intimately involved in this business \nin Massachusetts concluding that the funds which are flowing, which \nhave represented a very significant increase in funding--as shown by \nthis chart, $13.3 billion right now under this budget--more than \nexceeds what is needed to efficiently deal with the No Child Left \nBehind requirements.\n  One of the reasons we hear a lot about No Child Left Behind not being \nfunded I think is that most States and school districts today are under \nsignificant pressure. But the pressure is not coming from No Child Left \nBehind; the pressure is coming from local property tax burdens and \nState revenues.\n  We have gone through a recession and those States have contracted in \ntheir revenues. Property taxes have gone down. As a result, school \ndistricts find themselves under pressure. I do not deny that. Everybody \nrecognizes that. But because money is fungible, people easily identify \nthe Federal dollars as being less than what are required to fund what \ntraditionally would have been cost driven by and funded by local \nproperty taxes and State dollars.\n  The No Child Left Behind function is well funded. In fact, in this \nbill we have increased it again. It is up another $1 billion \nspecifically have increased special education funding in this bill by \n$1 billion. We have done that, by the way, without repealing the child \ntax credit. In fact, we plan to extend that. We have done that without \nrequiring parents--people who are married--having to pay more in taxes \nby not extending the marriage tax penalty relief language. We have done \nit by retaining the 10-percent expansion so low-income people pay much \nless in the way of taxes. All of that would be at risk--all three of \nthose areas--were the $17 billion of new taxes, which this amendment \nrepresents, to be adopted.\n\n  I do not believe this amendment is legitimate from a standpoint of \naddressing the concerns of No Child Left Behind. I do not believe it is \nconsistent with what happened in this Congress when the Democratic \nParty controlled the Presidency and the House and the Senate. It \nrequires full funding of an authorization level, which was not done at \nthat time.\n  I do believe it would have a huge detrimental impact, potentially, \nespecially on married women and men, as a result of its ironic identity \nwith the cost of extending the marriage penalty, which is $15 billion, \nwhich is essentially the amount of taxes this bill would raise.\n  I believe it is hard to defend this amendment either on a substantive \nground that it is going to make No Child Left Behind work better or on \na policy ground that it is consistent with historical actions in this \nCongress--funding full authorization--or on the ground that raising \ntaxes makes good sense because I do not think you can support raising \ntaxes, especially when it might have such a dilatory effect on married \npeople or people with children. Therefore, I strongly oppose this \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I would yield to the Senator from Louisiana on her \ntime.\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I think the Senator from Louisiana had a \nquestion. I yield to the Senator from Louisiana, but I ask that the \ntime for this question be taken off the side of the Democrats.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Washington yield time to \nthe Senator from Louisiana to ask a question of the Senator from New \nHampshire?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I would be happy to ask the question, but I think the \nSenator from Washington would like to ask the question, and then I \nassist her in that.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I have not yielded the floor yet.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Then, I will yield time to the Senator from Louisiana to \nask the Senator from New Hampshire a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is that acceptable to the Senator from New \nHampshire?\n  Mr. GREGG. As long as my answer is also coming off the time of the \nSenator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. No, I will not agree to that.\n  Mr. GREGG. Then, Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the Senator from New Hampshire has strewn \na number of arguments across the floor that need to be responded to. \nEvery one of them has a very legitimate, responsible answer.\n  I used to teach preschool, and I am reminded of the kids who came in \nand threw all their toys on the floor and then trying to figure out \nwhich one to pick up first to try to make it look better. Frankly, \nthere are so many arguments out here that I want to respond to--and I \nknow the Senator from Louisiana wants to respond to--but every one of \nthese arguments can legitimately and clearly be denied.\n\n  First, let me respond that this amendment does not raise taxes \ndespite the rhetoric from the other side. This amendment closes \nloopholes, just as the Republican budget requires within itself in \norder to pay for this. That is legitimate. It is not raising taxes. It \nis closing loopholes. I think it is an argument all of us in the \nChamber understand.\n  Senator Landrieu has been listening carefully to the Senator from New \nHampshire on his argument about funding and funding increases, and she \nis going to respond to that. I will yield her time to do that.\n  But let me point out, when President Clinton came into office in 1993 \nand 1994--and the Republican chart that was up only talked about 1993 \nand 1994; it did not talk about the tremendous increases later--the \nPresident's No. 1 priority at that time was to balance the budget, \nwhich was extremely out of whack. President Bush, when he came into \noffice--and that chart was showing us the numbers of increases at that \ntime--his No. 1 priority was to cut taxes. That is the difference.\n  I remind my colleagues on the other side, the reason the budgets for \neducation were increased is because Democrats demanded it. I know they \nhave forgotten this, but Democrats were in control in the Senate from \nabout June of 2001 until January of 2003, when much of those increases \nwere in place, because we came to the floor and said it needed to be \ndone.\n  I know my colleague, Senator Landrieu from Louisiana, is here. I \nyield to her such time as she needs to respond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. I appreciate the \nleadership of the Senator from Washington.\n  I am sorry the Senator from New Hampshire has left the floor because \nI do have about five points to make.\n  The first point I want to make is, while I respect his leadership in \neducation, and while I think he has absolutely put the best spin \npossible on the situation that we face, I would say, in Louisiana, that \ndog just won't hunt.\n  Those numbers don't add up. His charts do not tell the true story. \nPeople in Louisiana and throughout this country are very anxious right \nnow because what they want to hear is the truth, the whole truth, and \nnothing but the truth. While I am not saying those specific numbers \nwere not correct, the truth is not just about giving the specific \nnumbers; it is about the whole picture.\n  I will begin with the truth and the facts to put it in reference. I \nwish they would put the chart up, but they may not because they will \nnot be able to defend it. But if they would put the chart back up that \nshows the years they put up there--1993, 1994 and 1995--the Senator \nsaid when the Democrats were in charge in 1993, 1994, and 1995, we did \nnot\n\n[[Page S2480]]\n\nhave that much of an increase in education. That is true.\n  But what is also true is that the previous Republican administrations \nhad left this country in such debt and in such despair and the deficits \nwere so high that we could not contribute money to any program of any \nsubstance because the country was going broke.\n  So it is true we could not spend that much money on education because \nwe had to take care of the deficit, this big red line. So we had to cut \nback.\n  Although Republicans say the Democrats don't know how to cut back and \nDemocrats never will cut budgets, that is absolutely not true. We, \nunder good and solid leadership, started trimming back. And we had to \nraise some revenues to get the country back into surpluses. When we did \nget back into surpluses, the budget numbers will reflect that there \nwere increases made by the Clinton administration in education.\n  I will submit this document for the Record. It is a little scratched \nup and it is not very clear. I am sorry I don't have it in big print. \nBut it will be put in the Record. If anybody wants to argue about this \npage, they are more than welcome. This is the official document of the \nU.S. budget. Nobody will refute these numbers. They are all right here.\n  What they say is that there were increases of 15 percent, 12 percent, \n12 percent, 6.2 percent, 12 percent, 18 percent. It is true that as we \ngot surpluses, we gave more money to education. But what is also true \nis this budget, which Senator Murray is trying to amend but the \nRepublicans won't allow it, is saying that this budget, then, with \nthese surpluses, wants to take some of that surplus money and commit it \nto education. This budget says, no, we are going to commit to it tax \ncuts, all to tax cuts, and no money to education.\n  In addition, when President Bush came into office, which was 2001, \nalthough we had increased funding for education as the condition of the \ncountry improved and we were doing as much as we could, the truth is, \nthe President came into office and said: Even though we are increasing \nmoney to education, the past administration didn't do a good job, and \nI, as the new leader of the country, am going to put in a new law. We \nare going to step up the requirements and we are going to have \naccountability. If we do that, then I will fund those new efforts. As \nyou know, he and the Republican leadership have decided they are not \ngoing to fund it. They are going to provide tax cuts.\n  Let me talk about pressure. I know the Senator from New Hampshire, \nwho was Governor and is now Senator, understands pressure. I don't know \nexactly what he was talking about. Maybe he could clear this up.\n\n  But when I supported No Child Left Behind, 40 percent of the teachers \nin Louisiana were uncertified and their average salary was $27,000 a \nyear. We are one of the lowest in the country. But when that law was \npassed, a mandate was put in that all of those teachers had to be \ncertified by next year, 2005. We are in 2004. I don't know if the \nSenator from New Hampshire thinks that is not pressure, but let me tell \nyou, my superintendents are feeling some heat. My legislature is \nfeeling some heat. I am feeling some heat in a good way, because 40 \npercent of the teachers in Louisiana aren't certified. In this budget, \nwhich promised to help train them, help increase their skills, help \nrecruit them, the funding is not there to do it. That is what I call \npressure.\n  Let me talk about the pipeline for a minute. The pipeline issue came \nup because our Secretary of Education, supported by this \nadministration, after calling all the teachers in America and one of \nthe leading organizations a terrorist organization, which he has \napologized for but a lot of people don't think the apology went far \nenough, after calling them terrorists, he appeared before the committee \nand said, from a letter:\n\n       States are not fully utilizing the Federal education funds \n     available to them in a timely manner, allowing billions of \n     dollars to remain in the federal Treasury instead of \n     improving education for our children.\n\n  He has put in writing, for this administration, a charge to every \nGovernor, every superintendent, and every administrator across the \ncountry basically telling them, I don't know what you all are \ncomplaining about, because you have a lot of money.\n  Wait until you see the reaction that is going to happen across the \ncountry. It starts with the superintendent of Iowa who has gone on \nrecord as saying:\n\n       The implication that we have let huge sums of federal money \n     languish, that the funds are at our disposal to use at our \n     discretion, or that we have not been good stewards of the \n     public money is not only unfair, but it is patently \n     insulting.\n\n  If this administration, the Republican leadership, wants to continue \nto insult everyone in America who is trying their best across party \nlines, across racial lines, across geographic lines to improve \neducation, if they want to keep putting out insults such as this, they \nmay go right ahead. But that dog doesn't hunt. The arguments won't \nstand. The facts do not justify the story that is being told.\n  I am going to conclude with this. The facts are these: When the \ncountry was in huge deficits, which the Republicans, in large measure, \nwere responsible for because of their irresponsible policies, \neverything had to be cut back. And as soon as the surpluses started to \nappear, which was a good thing and everyone worked on making that \nhappen, we said: Let's set a new course for education and invest money \nbut not just throw money at the problem. Because I agree money is not \nthe solution, but let's have accountability and we will find results.\n  We started down the path. We believed the administration. We pressed \non, and then the rug was pulled out from under our feet. That is what \nthis budget is about. That is what Senator Murray's amendment is about. \nI am proud to be a cosponsor of it and that is the truth.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the following material in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                                                             DEPARTMENT OF

 Ms. LANDRIEU. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I understand the Senator from Wyoming is \non the floor. I want to set up some\n\n[[Page S2481]]\n\ntime allotment for our side so we can go back and forth. Under our \ntime, I yield 10 minutes to the Senators from Delaware, 5 minutes to \nthe Senator from New Mexico, and 10 minutes to the Senator from \nMinnesota. We will alternate time with the other side as they require.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. Do I understand that Senator Biden and I have 10 minutes \nto divide among ourselves?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator has 10 minutes. I assume that is equally \ndivided. If you need more than that, I am happy to yield it.\n  Mr. CARPER. What I would like to do is have maybe 5 minutes to talk \non your amendment, and then Senator Biden and I wish to welcome some \nspecial guests.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. That is fine. I will yield the time on my side to allow \nthem to do that.\n  Mr. CARPER. I thank the Senator.\n  I will say a word, if I can, in support of Senator Murray's amendment \nto fully fund No Child Left Behind.\n  In 1995, the Congress passed, with the urging of many Governors, \nunfunded mandate legislation that said Congress and the Federal \nGovernment should not tell the States what to do and then not provide \nthe money to do it. The Federal Government should not be taking money \naway from States without providing an offsetting amount of revenue for \nthe money taken off the table for the States.\n  If we fail to adequately fund No Child Left Behind, yet at the same \ntime mandate higher performance requirements in classrooms, whether it \nis in Delaware, Washington, New Hampshire, South Carolina, or in New \nMexico, we are putting in place an unfunded mandate. I have been \nvisiting a number of schools in my State over the last couple of weeks. \nWhat I have asked is, what have you done with the extra money we have \ngiven you as a result of No Child Left Behind? I got some interesting \nanswers.\n  A lot of the money is being invested especially in title I increases, \nin early childhood. We are seeing some remarkable results. These \nchildren who are doomed to fail, instead of going on to failure, have \nage 3 and age 4 quality prekindergarten programs, and age 5 full-day \nkindergarten programs, and extra learning time that follows beyond \nthat, and there are remarkable results.\n  By the time these kids are in the third grade, they are doing \nbasically as well as the kids coming from places where we expect \nsuccess. We are cutting in half our revenues to special education. I \nurge my colleagues to support the amendment proposed by our colleague \nfrom Washington to fully fund No Child Left Behind.\n  I will add a few comments to that, if I may. Every minute, the Bush \nadministration spends $991,000 more than it takes in--every minute. \nDuring the 2 minutes I have been talking, we have spent about $2 \nmillion more than we are taking in.\n  In 2001, the first year I was here, and when George Bush was \nPresident, he said:\n\n       We can proceed with tax relief without fear of budget \n     deficits.\n\n  He was wrong.\n  He said:\n\n       Our budget will run a deficit that will be small and short-\n     term.\n\n  He was wrong.\n  In 2003, he said:\n\n       Our current deficit is not large by historical standards \n     and is manageable.\n\n  He was wrong.\n  Now he says:\n\n       The deficit will be cut in half over the next 5 years.\n\n  He is wrong again.\n  My friends, our budget deficit this year is going to be about a half \ntrillion dollars. When you actually take away the surplus funds from \nSocial Security that mask the Federal budget deficit, it is even larger \nthan that. While there is a little downtrend starting this year for a \ncouple years in the budget deficits, the real budget deficit, the \noperating deficit, is about $450 billion. Then it climbs steadily up. \nThe boomers, my generation, will begin to retire, and we are looking at \na budget deficit for 2014 of about $785 billion. That is three-quarters \nof a trillion dollars. Those are operating deficits, not debt.\n\n  I wish we had a chart of the debt. We do.\n  In 1962, I was a 15-year-old kid growing up in Danville, VA. It is \nhard to see the red ink down there on the chart because it wasn't very \nmuch. It was less than a trillion dollars; it was a couple hundred \nbillion dollars. In 1982, we hit $1 trillion. In 2003, last year, we \nexploded up to about $6.8 trillion. You can see this leveling off from \nabout 1998, 1999, and 2000. That is what happened in the last \nadministration and in the very beginning of this administration.\n  What happens now, starting in 2003, is the debt--real debt, how much \nwe are borrowing as a country from the Bank of China and banks in \nJapan, and from people all over the world--goes from where it is today, \nabout $7 trillion, to in 2014 some $15 trillion.\n  There are going to be about 29 or so babies born in Delaware today. \nThey are going to be facing something I call a birth tax. Some of my \ncolleagues on the other side talk about a death tax, which is their \nterm for the estate tax. I am talking about a birth tax. For every baby \nborn in my State today, they will face a debt of $35,000 apiece when \nthey come into the world. So do their brothers and sisters and parents \nand grandparents. By 2009, it is going to be over $35,000. That is the \nkind of welcome to the world we are giving children in my State, and \nother States as well.\n  The fastest growing entitlement program in the Federal budget is not \nthe Medicare plan or Social Security or Medicaid. The fastest growing \nentitlement program in our Federal budget is servicing our national \ndebt, as you can see from the last chart I shared with you.\n  In 2009, our Federal Government will spend some $1.5 billion per day \nin interest on our national debt. In 2009, the Federal Government will \nspend more money servicing the debt than we spend on the entire defense \nfor our country.\n  I will say that again. In 2009, we are going to spend, if we stay on \nthis track, more money servicing the Federal Government's debt than on \ndefending our Nation.\n  Let's get real. I don't have the time to go through this entire \nchart, but this is instructive. The debt we are going to have this \nyear--about $521 billion--is actually more than all of our nondefense \ndiscretionary spending. We could get rid of the EPA, the housing \nprograms, the education programs, and homeland security on the \nappropriations side--everything but defense--and we would still have a \ndeficit of about $55 billion or $56 billion.\n  There will be a vote later this week, beyond the vote on the Murray \namendment. I think it will be offered by Senator Feingold of Wisconsin. \nIt speaks to getting real. There was a time not too long ago when we \nwere real. When somebody came to the floor and said, I want to raise \nspending by some magnitude, they had to come up with an offset. If they \nwanted to raise spending, they had to cut spending someplace else or \nraise revenue by that amount. Similarly, if I or anybody else wanted to \ncome here and say, let's cut taxes by some amount of money, we had to \ncome up with an offset. That is common sense in my State. That is just \ncommon sense. We used to do business that way here.\n  A couple of years ago, those pay-as-you-go rules lapsed. We need to \nreinstate them. We have the opportunity to do that this week. In an \nhour or so, we are going to vote on the Murray amendment to avoid an \nunfunded mandate and make good to those kids born in Delaware today and \naround the country so they are not saddled with a huge debt to face for \nthe rest of their lives, and to give them a chance to be successful in \nschool and in life.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The senior Senator from \nDelaware is recognized.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I am told we used up a lot of the time, \nnecessarily. I ask unanimous consent to have an additional 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GREGG. Reserving the right to object, I didn't hear that.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Earlier the distinguished Senator from Washington yielded \nto Senator Carper and me to allow us to both acknowledge support for \nher amendment and then a total of 10 minutes of morning business to \nspeak to another issue.\n\n[[Page S2482]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1 minute remaining of that time.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that my \ncolleagues would permit an additional total of 10 minutes, divided \nbetween the junior Senator from Delaware and myself.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Biden and Mr. Carper are printed in today's \nRecord under ``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield to the Senator from Wyoming such time as he may \nconsume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I rise in opposition to the amendment. I \nreally appreciate the comments of the Senator from New Hampshire where \nhe went over the No Child Left Behind legislation and what it really \ndoes. The No Child Left Behind legislation is to get kids to be able to \nread and do math, hopefully by the time they are in third grade but \ndefinitely by the time they graduate from high school, and to have some \nconfidence in it. Every State has the right to set their own standards \nand they have to follow them, but the idea is to get them to do reading \nand math.\n  We held some hearings in Wyoming. I had the Department of Education \ncome to Wyoming and talk about some of the rules and there were \nconcerns about the law and some of the ways it affected Wyoming. We are \na very rural State. We have a large State. We have very small \npopulations. We have some different classrooms than in other places and \nwe needed to be sure when the rules were written they would work for \nWyoming, which has a very tough law that was already in place before No \nChild Left Behind even came along.\n  It has increasingly difficult standards that have to be met over the \nnext several years, and they adopted that as their No Child Left Behind \nstandards. I do not want people to have the impression No Child Left \nBehind forced the States to do all of these things. Yes, it did force \nsome of the States to do some of these things, but a lot of the States \nwere already doing things to make sure no child got left behind.\n  I appreciate the President joining those States and encouraging in a \nvery forceful way the other States to do that, too.\n  Incidentally, I had people drive as far as 200 miles to come to one \nof these hearings and we are going to hold two more of them in Wyoming \nyet. But I did have one person stand up and say there is not anything \nin No Child Left Behind about improving physical education and that is \nvery important. If people are not healthy, they cannot do well in \nschool.\n  I pointed out there also is not anything in No Child Left Behind that \nsays they have to have competence in science until several years from \nnow, and that is very important. We are starting with some very basic \npoints. If a child cannot read and do math, they do not stand much of a \nchance. Their choices in life are very limited, and the President \nrecognized that.\n  He did not say: On the average, we want everybody to be able to read \nand do math. He said: I want every child in this country to be able to \nread and do math.\n  That is where we are starting. Now, we have places we can go with \nthat, science will be added in, and other things can be added in, but \nwe are trying to do something very basic. We also get the impression \nfrom this discussion the Federal Government provides all of the money \nfor education. That is not true and it never was true. I do not think \nit was ever intended to be true. We used to provide about 7 percent of \nthe education dollars in the United States. The local people provided \nthe rest of it.\n\n  It always fascinated me that for the 7 percent in education funding \nwe provided, we caused 50 percent or more of the paperwork. Yes, we \nreally tie a lot of things to our money that does not have anything to \ndo with local control. It has to do with jobs in Washington because if \nwe have a lot of reporting that has to be done, somebody has to make \nsure those reports are filled out.\n  I had a school superintendent who came out for one semester. He spent \nsome time in my office, and actually I had him go down to the \nDepartment of Education and look at where his reports were going and \nwhat was done with them. He was fascinated to find out they read all of \nthem. He was tremendously disappointed to find out that is all that \nhappened to them, and he did not see why we were filling out reports \nthat just provided people with a job to make sure the report was \ncomplete.\n  There is a lot of room to eliminate paperwork. That would save time \nand money at the local level, which is absolutely essential.\n  I also wish there was more in the bill that dealt with parental \nresponsibility. When the parents are involved in a child's education, \nthe child does better. Again, we focused on reading and math and what \nthe schools could do because that is where the money goes.\n  We held a hearing last week and one of the people present mentioned \nthat in one area of the country, Washington State, there was a high \nschool that forced the parents to sign up the courses for the kids. \nThat is a fascinating concept. Kids in high school can go sign up for \ntheir own courses, and when they do they will say: This one looks easy, \nand this teacher is easy for an A, and I like doing this because it is \na little more outdoors. But when the parents look at it, they say: I \nwant my kid to excel and these are the things he or she will have to do \nor be able to do to excel in the school. It makes a whole lot of \ndifference in what the kids take. The biggest difference is the parents \nhave to pay attention to what they want their kids to be able to do and \nmake sure the plan they are signing their kids up for will make that \nkind of progress.\n  In the discussion over our priorities on the current budget, my \ncolleagues continue to suggest funding for education is being ignored. \nWell, we have had some charts that show it is not being ignored; it has \nbeen greatly increased under the Bush administration.\n  We had a fascinating display of a chart on the other side that gave \nthe impression the reason the Clinton administration had declining \namounts going into education funds was because there was a deficit and \nthey were trying to overcome the deficit. I remember when I arrived \nhere 8 years ago we were trying to force that balanced budget \nconstitutional amendment. We failed by one vote, but it had a positive \neffect. The positive effect was both sides of the aisle understood we \nneeded to do a better job on balancing the budget, and we did. That \nhelped grow the economy, and the economy's growth is really what \nprovided the money. We did not cut programs. We increased programs. We \ndid not eliminate programs. We added new programs. The growth of the \neconomy kept ahead of the spending.\n  There have been a number of things that have affected the economy \nlately, but a very important part of this discussion is, we are on the \nU.S. budget. We are not appropriating. We are not doing Finance \nCommittee work of figuring out what the taxes should be. We are doing a \nbudget. The purpose of a budget is to set targets. Maybe that is not a \ngood word to use on this floor, but I think it is a very important word \nto use. It reminds me of a cartoon that I saw of a grizzly bear that \nhad this big target on his chest, and the other bears gathered around \nand said: Oh, rotten birthmark, rotten birthmark.\n\n  Targets are important, and all the budget does is set targets up. We \ndo not shoot at them. We do not decide how big the rings are going to \nbe. But we set targets up.\n  Now, if my colleague will listen to the debate we are having, \nsometimes we are suggesting the target be moved a little higher. \nSometimes we suggest the target be moved a little to the left. \nSometimes we suggest the target be moved a little to the right. Listen \ncarefully and see if anybody ever suggests moving the target down. No. \nThat is not good politics. It is important politics, but it is not good \npolitics.\n  What we are going to do is set the budget, the targets. Once those \ntargets are set, the authorization committees get to work with them. \nThey are the ones who actually work with the rings of the budget. They \ndecide what the priorities are and how big each of those ought to be, \nand then the money gets turned over to the Appropriations Committee. \nThey are the first ones\n\n[[Page S2483]]\n\nthat get to shoot at the target. When that comes to the floor, we get \nto shoot at the target. Everything before that is setting up targets.\n  A lot of the discussion we have heard this morning is based on three \nassumptions I believe are mistaken. The first assumption of my \ncolleague from Washington State is that raising taxes, by repealing \nsome or all of the recent tax reductions, will not have a negative \nimpact on the economy. I noticed that the discussion changed a little \nbit to loopholes, and it was pointed out that in the budget there are \nsome loopholes. We talked very specifically about some loopholes, how \nbig those loopholes are and whether they could be achieved in the \nbudget assumption. I think in order to add to that, a person would have \nto figure out what those other loopholes are. There is a limited amount \nof loopholes. There are some real ones that can be identified. They can \nhave a price put on them. But if that is not done, what is being talked \nabout is the common campaign tactic of saying we are going to take it \nout of waste, fraud, and abuse.\n  Yes, probably in many of the Government programs there is waste, \nfraud, and abuse. If you add it up, there is a limited amount of it. \nFinding it and eliminating it is a whole other problem. The same with \nloopholes.\n  So when they talk about the money here, they are talking about \nraising taxes, which would repeal all or some of the recent tax \nreductions, and it would have an impact on the economy.\n  The truth is, a tax increase would hurt economic growth, which is the \nmost important factor in terms of revenue. I mentioned that how we were \nactually able to come up with surpluses was growth, not reducing \nprograms.\n  The second assumption my colleague is making is that the Federal \nGovernment is somehow responsible for creating new jobs. As a former \nsmall business owner, I know firsthand that expanding Government is not \nthe best way to create jobs. Taxing small business is not the best way \nto create jobs.\n  We keep talking about these rich people out there. A lot of those \nrich people are not rich at all. They have businesses and, because they \nare single proprietorships or partnerships or subchapter S \ncorporations, whatever profit shows up on the balance sheet goes to the \nbottom line on their taxes. It is considered to be money they have \nearned on which they need to pay taxes.\n  But having been a small businessman, this is how that really works. \nYes, your business shows a profit at the end of the year. Yes, it is \nhonest accounting. But you don't get to take the money out. Hopefully, \nyou have a growing business, and a growing business needs ever more \namounts of revenue. That is what the big corporations do, too. Their \nprofits don't get paid out every year in the way of dividends. They \nstay in the corporation to grow the corporation.\n  The difference is, if you are a regular corporation you pay a small \ntax on the money that stays in there. When the dividend gets paid out, \nthere are additional taxes that get paid on it. So it is not very \nappealing to the small businessman to use that form of corporation. But \nif they go with the subchapter S, or single proprietorship, there are \nsome advantages to that, but the big disadvantage is they pay the tax \nin the year the balance sheet shows they earn it and they don't get to \ntake that out.\n  When we are talking about raising taxes on the rich people in this \ncountry, that is a nice phrase people like to use but most of those \nbusiness owners I know don't consider themselves to be rich. They do \nconsider themselves to have a good business and they are employing a \nlot of people.\n  When we are talking about businesses, we are talking about small \nbusinesses, we are talking about 90 percent of the businesses in this \ncountry, and we are talking about the vast majority of jobs in this \ncountry. I can tell you for a fact when somebody works for a small \nbusiness, they understand how tenuous their job is. They understand how \nfragile some of these small businesses are. They don't have the vast \nmarket to fall back on. If there is a small change in their market, it \ncan mean the end of their job; the same as a change in taxes can make a \ndifference in whether that person stays in business or goes to work for \nsomebody else, abandoning the business and losing jobs.\n  When we are talking about taxes, we have to keep that in mind. The \nFederal Government can leverage resources. We were talking about job \ntraining, too. They can leverage resources to help train individuals \nfor available jobs, but job creation is something done best by the \nprivate sector in this economy and it functions best when the Federal \nGovernment is not taxing these small businesses beyond the point where \nthey are sustainable.\n  It has been interesting. When we were back in the times of the mega \nmergers, when the big companies would combine together to form an even \nbigger company, and then have what they called a downsizing, or a \n``right sizing''--that is when they would lay off 6,000 or 9,000 \npeople; I called it laying people off--when that happened, the small \nbusinesses of the country picked up those employees. So it is not the \nbig businesses of this country that do the job for us; it is the small \nbusinesses in this country. And a change in taxes affects those small \nbusinesses.\n  I am also confused as to why my colleagues argue for additional \nfunding for programs that they argue will help generate jobs, yet they \ncontinue to oppose naming conferees to the Workforce Investment Act, \nwhich would help train individuals for jobs that are already available.\n  The Workforce Investment Act passed last year. Senator Murray and I \nworked on that, along with Senator Kennedy. We got it out of committee \nunanimously. We got it through this body unanimously. Now we can't name \na conference committee. Until a conference committee is named and we \ncan work out the differences with the House, improvements to that bill \nare not available.\n  Training for 900,000 people is in jeopardy. Training for people who \ncould upgrade their skills to fill in the kinds of jobs that are \navailable in the country versus the jobs they are trained for. It is \n900,000 jobs a year and we can't have a conference committee to get \nthat done. It makes more sense to me that we would try to fill the jobs \nthat are available now rather than spending more Federal dollars to try \nto create jobs.\n  The third assumption my colleagues are making is that this Congress \nis not maintaining its commitment to education. I would like to point \nout to my colleagues that under this Federal budget resolution, Federal \neducation funding will be at its highest level in history. It will come \nclose to doubling since the year 2000--doubling. We doubled the \nNational Institutes of Health's budget over a period of about 8 years, \nbut this President has nearly doubled the education budget since 2000--\nnearly doubled it. It amazes me.\n  The opposition, of course, is upset with that because this President \nhas had the audacity to take the leadership on education. Leadership in \neducation used to be from the other side of the aisle. But this \nPresident said, We are going to do it, and he put the dollars behind it \nto do it. It amazes me that, despite these increases every year, we \nhear about how this administration and the current congressional \nleadership failed to support adequate funding for educational programs, \nparticularly title I of No Child Left Behind.\n  The truth is, these programs have seen enormous increases over the \npast 4 years. Even so, my colleagues assert that we are somehow \nundermining our commitment to education.\n\n  I am reminded of the debate this body had over last year's budget \nresolution. We heard over and over from our minority colleagues that \nthe Federal commitment to education was too small. Despite all of the \ndiscussion surrounding our failure to support education funding, the \ncurrent Senate leadership has increased spending for title I and other \neducational programs more than any other Congress in history. Yet my \ncolleagues argue that is insufficient. They argue we need to raise \ntaxes to support more education spending.\n  What is the impact of all this new spending on education? State and \nnational studies show that funding for No Child Left Behind is \nadequate. I would like to remind my colleagues from Massachusetts that \na study in their State suggested that more than enough funding is \navailable for implementation of the law. Opponents of the budget \nresolution might suggest that other\n\n[[Page S2484]]\n\nStates have found that funding for No Child Left Behind is insufficient \nand that more money is needed. Many of these estimates are based on \nsome risky assumptions. Some of these studies are anticipating costs \nmore than 10 years into the future.\n  As an accountant, it strikes me that these studies are missing the \npoint, because they are suggesting that current funding is inadequate \nfor challenges that are not even going to appear for 5 or 10 years in \nthe future, if they appear at all.\n  I asked for some information about the title I grants for local \neducational agencies to see what kinds of increases we have had between \n2001 and 2005. I was fascinated to see Louisiana, which has been part \nof the discussion this morning, had a 46.9-percent increase in \nfunding. Massachusetts got a 24.1 percent increase in Title I. New York \ngot an increase of 65.2 percent. Rhode Island got an increase of 76 \npercent. Washington State got an increase of 47.9 percent.\n\n  The Senator from Louisiana also mentioned they didn't have enough \nmoney. It is kind of fascinating to me that out of the discretionary \nfunds, those that weren't used reverted to the U.S. Treasury. I have \nthe list by State. Louisiana surrendered 6.37 million to the United \nStates Treasury. All together more than $154 million was returned to \nthe Treasury. All of it isn't being used.\n  I spoke to one Wyoming superintendent. He said the biggest problem \nwith title I was they needed more flexibility to be able to shift that \nmoney to salaries because they already have all they can possibly buy \nwith title I. I thought that was interesting.\n  I also would like to point out to my colleagues that the ``wealthy'' \nindividuals who would be paying for these increases couldn't possibly \nafford to fund all the additional spending my colleagues in the \nminority are recommending. They would have to earn much more than $1 \nmillion a year. As my colleague from Utah has pointed out repeatedly, \nit is the small business owners who will be paying the bulk of these \ntaxes.\n  I don't believe you want to send the message to the people who \nmanaged to achieve the American dream and finally have financial \nsecurity that the Federal Government will then turn to them and ask \nthem to surrender a much larger portion of their income and call it \ntheir ``civic duty.'' I shouldn't have to remind my colleagues that the \nhighest tax rates in this country already apply to the wealthiest \nAmericans. The graduated tax scale relies largely on the wealthiest 10 \npercent of Americans for most of the Federal Government's revenue \nalready.\n  The ``wealthiest'', as I have explained, are the people who are \nbusiness owners who are putting most of that back into a business. My \ncolleagues are suggesting these Americans don't contribute enough and \nif these Americans were truly interested in their country's well-being, \nthey would agree their taxes should be even higher. I think that is \nsimply ridiculous.\n  I don't believe the tax increase is the only option we should \nconsider. We are discussing a budget that would provide $814 billion in \ndiscretionary spending. My colleagues are saying that simply is not \nenough money.\n  Reflecting on my experience as an accountant again, when a company is \nrunning deficits there are two things that can be done: They can raise \nrevenue or they can cut spending. This body has shown an insatiable \nappetite for new spending, but there is a genuine lack of support for \nreductions in spending. We talk about tax loopholes, we talk about \nfraud, waste, and abuse, and we talk about tax increases, but we don't \ntalk about truly cutting because we haven't got the will to do it. Even \nwhen we talk about increases, it is not enough.\n  I mention the targets we put up for the budget, the targets the \nappropriators actually see. We talk about raising them, moving them to \nthe right or moving them to the left, but never lowering them.\n  In the President's budget, there was some tremendous leadership. The \nPresident actually suggested cutting some programs. Why did he suggest \ncutting programs? He suggested it because Congress imposes on the \nFederal Government the Government Performance and Results Act. We said \nevery federal program in this country has to do a report every year. In \nthat report they have to show what their application is, what their \ngoals are, how they are going to accomplish it, and how that fits with \nthe money they are spending. They have to tell us what the job is they \nare doing and how they are getting it done.\n\n  It might be interesting to people who are listening, that in some of \nthe agencies some of their programs failed those reviews. They aren't \ndoing what they said they would do. According to the reports those \npeople are writing, they are not doing their job. The President said if \nthey are not doing their job, let us cut the program.\n  I can tell you that on the Budget Committee we did not do that. That \nis not in the budget. We didn't cut any of those programs no matter how \nbad the Government Performance and Results Act showed them to be. That \nwould have been $5.9 billion. I hear that is not enough to do anything, \nbut it would be a big part of what we are trying to do in this \namendment for education. We are not cutting those programs. We will \nhave constituents and interested people who will try to prove the \nGovernment Performance and Results Act reports were absolutely wrong.\n  We need to have some courage to cut some things, to revise some \nthings, and to consolidate some things. That is what businesses would \nbe doing. Businesses have to make cuts when revenues go down unless \nthey can figure out a way to get those revenues to come up. They \nusually do both. They try to figure out a way to get the revenues to \ncome up, but they also cut programs that don't work. They get rid of \nproducts that aren't selling.\n  For some of those programs, the products are only selling to the \npeople who are employed by the programs--not to all of them. For some \nof them, it was probably a gross error in writing their report. But if \nwe ever cut some of those, I would bet there would be a lot more \nattention paid to their own reports on performance and goals. That is \nsomething we ought to be doing.\n  Even under the current budget circumstances, my colleagues are asking \nfor even more spending. At what point can we say enough is enough? How \nmuch Federal spending is adequate? I think I have said enough about \nraising taxes and why this body must oppose any effort to finance \nadditional government spending by levying further taxes on our \ncitizens.\n  Discretionary education spending has increased by 64 percent since \n2000. In real dollars, there has been more than a $13 billion increase \nin discretionary program funding since 2000. Of that total, $4.5 \nbillion has been in title I alone. More than enough has been dedicated \nin spending to cover the mandatory expenses of the No Child Left Behind \nAct. Additional increases are both unnecessary and irresponsible given \nthe current budget situation. As we speak, States are waiting on new \nincreases even though they have nearly $6 billion in unobligated \nfunding to them. Almost $2 billion of that total is title I funding. It \nis time we stop taxing and spending to meet needs that have not \npresented themselves yet.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator \nSarbanes and Senator Bingaman as cosponsors of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I rise in strong support of the \nMurray-Kennedy amendment. This would fully fund the No Child Left \nBehind Act. The question of how much money the Federal Government \nshould provide to local school districts to assist in meeting the goals \nof the No Child Left Behind Act was something we discussed extensively \nwhen the bill was being written. Many of us urged that those figures be \nhigher than they wound up being, but the authorizing legislation \ncontains figures which we think the Congress should honor and should \nstep up to and fund. That is exactly what this amendment would do. I \ncongratulate my colleagues, Senator Murray and Senator Kennedy, for \nputting this amendment forward.\n\n[[Page S2485]]\n\n  As I am sure has been discussed extensively, the core idea behind the \nNo Child Left Behind Act was we would require States and school \ndistricts to establish what would be considered performance goals for \ntheir students, that they would make what we call ``adequate yearly \nprogress'' in achieving those goals, and that the Federal Government is \ncommitted to provide assistance in doing that. Unfortunately, we have \nfallen short. Unfortunately, this President has not asked for the full \nfunding on that legislation in any year since it has been in effect. \nAgain this year, he has not asked for that funding. This amendment \nwould try to correct that problem. I believe it is a very meritorious \namendment.\n  I want to particularly spend my very few minutes here focused on one \nparticular program I have spoken about many times on the Senate floor. \nIt is very important in my home State of New Mexico; that is, a \nprovision in the No Child Left Behind legislation the President signed \nwhich calls for the Federal Government to assist local school districts \nin trying to keep kids in school. It was dropout prevention efforts by \nthe Federal Government to assist the local school districts in pursuing \nthose. The idea was, as you are requiring more and more of students, \nteachers, and schools, there is a great temptation on the part of those \nschools and those teachers to just say, let's look the other way and \nallow some of these poorly performing students to leave school. That \nway we can get our standards up and everyone will be happy.\n\n  Unfortunately, that has happened. It is happening in my State. It is \nhappening in many States in the country. We are not doing what we \ncommitted to do--we, the Federal Government are not doing what we \ncommitted to do in that legislation to assist schools in heading this \noff. We committed in the legislation to provide $125 million per year \nto assist in dropout prevention. This year, this current year, we are \nproviding $5 million--not $125 million but $5 million. Considering the \nnumber of school districts in this country, the number of students who \nare at risk of dropping out, this is a ridiculously low figure.\n  Unfortunately, if we are not able to adopt the Murray-Kennedy \namendment, we are going to be faced with a situation where when we come \nto the Appropriations Committee, they will say there is no money to \nfund this. It was funded at $5 million. Maybe we will continue to fund \nit at $5 million again. Essentially, the Federal Government is going to \nonce again take a walk on any responsibility to assist with solving \nthis problem.\n  I believe firmly when we allow a student to drop out of school before \nthey graduate, we are leaving that student behind. We are leaving that \nchild behind. Clearly, we need to make a priority out of this. This is \na problem that particularly affects my State. We have a very large \nHispanic and Native American population. The graduation rates among \nthose groups are slightly better than 50 percent. That means we will \nfind half of the Hispanic and Native American students who started in \nthe 9th grade actually going through that graduation ceremony. That is \na terrible indictment of our education system. The least we can do is \nput in the small amount that was contemplated when we wrote the No \nChild Left Behind Act.\n  This is very important to schools throughout my State, to the larger \nschools, also to the rural schools. I hope it is a correction that can \nbe made. I hope very much the Murray-Kennedy amendment is adopted so \nthe funds will be there to actually accomplish this objective.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KOHL. Madam President, I rise today in strong support of the \nMurray amendment. I am proud to cosponsor this amendment, which will \nfinally provide the funding that Congress and the President promised \nwhen No Child Left Behind became law.\n  I supported the No Child Left Behind Act because I believed it would \nprovide a real chance for real reform. For the first time, the Federal \nGovernment would provide the resources that schools, teachers and \nprincipals need to help all students succeed. And in return, we \nrequired real accountability for results. Teachers, principals and \nschool boards are working hard to live up to their end of the bargain \nas they work to meet the requirements of the new law. Now they are \ncounting on us to live up to our end.\n  Unfortunately, the President's fiscal year 2005 budget request--and \nthe budget resolution before the Senate today--fall far short. This \nbudget resolution falls $8.6 billion short of what was authorized under \nNo Child Left Behind. Just when we're asking schools to do more, this \nbudget resolution takes away the very funding they need to succeed.\n  It might be easy to dismiss this shortfall when you talk about it in \nterms of billions of dollars. So I want to tell my colleagues here what \nthis shortfall in funding has actually meant for schools in my State of \nWisconsin. In 2003, Milwaukee Public Schools received an $8 million \nincrease in Title I funds. But the new requirements for supplemental \nservices and transportation for students to better performing schools \ncost over $10 million. In other words, the new mandates cost $2 million \nmore than the total increase MPS received, and they had to make up the \ndifference. To cover the costs, they were forced to cut their popular \nsummer school program, which had served 17,000 students.\n  This is just one example. Across Wisconsin, school districts are \nbeing forced to cut staff and increase class sizes, cut music, art and \nforeign language education, and cut textbook purchases. Some have even \nhad to keep their schools colder during the winter months to cut down \non their heating bills, or restrict how many pages students can print \nfrom their computers. These are certainly not the results we want.\n  Problems exist at the State level, too. Our State Department of \nPublic Instruction is working hard to implement the new law. But they \nbelieve they will need more funding to create new data systems to meet \nnew data collection and reporting requirements. They will also need \nmore funding for technical assistance teams to help schools and \ndistricts in need of improvement.\n  It is time that the Senate and the President lived up to the promises \nthat were made. The Murray amendment would establish a reserve fund to \nadd $8.6 billion to the Budget Resolution for the purpose of fully \nfunding No Child Left Behind. At the same time, this amendment lowers \nthe deficit by $8.6 billion. The amendment is fully offset. I hope my \ncolleagues will support this important amendment and finally provide \nthe funding that our students need to succeed.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President. I want to express my strong \nsupport for Senator Murray's amendment to the budget resolution to \nfully fund the No Child Left Behind, NCLB, Act.\n  Adequate funding is a necessity for school districts to continue to \nachieve adequate yearly progress. When Congress passed and the \nPresident signed NCLB, we set standards of achievement to improve \neducation for all. However, I have been woefully disappointed with the \nadministration's refusal to make good on the promises it made to \nprovide state and local school districts with the resources they need \nto implement the NCLB reforms. The administration has underfunded NCLB \nby $26 billion since 2002.\n  In my home State of South Dakota, education officials and educators \nare working very hard to meet the requirements of this law. It is \nirresponsible for the Federal Government to say that States and school \ndistricts must meet the requirements in this law, while we do not meet \nthe promises made in this law to provide funding to do so. Under NCLB, \nSouth Dakota should receive $62.3 million for Title I for Fiscal Year \n2005. President Bush's budget would shortchange South Dakota by $24.6 \nmillion. This would result in 8,029 South Dakota children being denied \nfull Title I services for which they are eligible. This is unacceptable \nto me.\n  As I travel South Dakota and meet with superintendents, principals, \neducators, school board members, and parents, I hear about how hard our \nschools are working to provide the best education possible to their \nstudents. However, this trend of continuing to underfund NCLB \ncommitments will only make it more and more difficult\n\n[[Page S2486]]\n\nfor our local school districts to meet the adequate yearly progress \nrequirements of the law.\n  This Congress and the administration have an obligation to uphold our \npromise that no child be left behind by the public education system. I \nencourage my colleagues to support Senator Murray's amendment, which \nwould go a long way in helping our schools meet the challenges in \nNCLB.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, when this President came to office he \ncalled himself the education President and called for significant \nreforms. When he offered these reforms he promised to provide us with \nthe resources needed to implement them. Taking him at his word, this \nbody took up and enacted the No Child Left Behind Act two years ago. \nYet here we are, only 2 years later, and No child Left Behind is being \nunderfunded by $8.6 billion.\n  When we passed the No Child Left Behind Act we pledged to expect \nmore, and provide more, to our Nation's schools. And yet this pledge is \nnot reflected in this budget. I have to ask, how do my Republican \ncolleagues and the administration, expect us to raise test scores, \nprovide high quality teachers and prepare students for the 21st century \nwithout the funds to do so? Furthermore, who is it that they expect to \nfeel the burden of these cuts? I can tell you who it will be.\n  First, it will be the States. States that need every dollar possible \nto do more than they have ever been asked to do before. States that are \nexperiencing the worst fiscal crisis in decades. Second, it will be the \nlocalities. With less funds to do more, hard decisions will have to be \nmade at the local level. Should local taxes be raised? Should music and \nart be cut? Should after school programs be eliminated? Should physical \neducation classes be cut in the midst of a childhood obesity epidemic? \nUltimately, the students will suffer. They will not be given the \nteachers that they need. They may not get the tutoring that they were \npromised. Music, art and foreign language may no longer be a part of \nthe curriculum. After school programs could be cut.\n  When we passed No Child Left Behind, we made it clear that we were \nexpecting more from our schools--and rightfully so. We were expecting \nmore so that American children--all American children--children in the \nsuburbs, children in our inner cities, children in our rural areas--\nwould have real opportunities to reach their full potential.\n  This past September, some Connecticut students went back to schools \nthat were labeled under performing by No Child Left Behind. And yet \nthis budget is not committed to helping them overcome that label. This \nbill will not give them the added funds they need to fully perform.\n  If we fail to adequately fund No Child Left Behind, our States, our \nlocalities, our school districts, local taxpayers, and most \nimportantly, our children, will suffer. Budgets are about priorities. \nWhat priority could be more important than ensuring the future of our \nchildren by providing them with a first-class, world-class education.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, I support the Murray-Kennedy amendment \nto meet the funding promises in the No Child Left Behind Act.\n  When I voted for the No Child Left Behind Act I though we made a deal \nwith our local school districts--we would ask more of them and we would \nprovide the resources to allow them to meet those expectations. Today \nit is clear that this administration has deliberately chosen not to \nplay by its own rules and has instead reneged on the promises it made \nto teachers, parents and millions of poor school children across the \nNation.\n  For a third year running, this administration has shortchanged the \nreforms included in No Child Left Behind. Instead of helping ensure \nthese children are not left behind, this administration has had a clear \nrecord of promising false hopes and of cutting resources targeted \ntowards improving educational opportunities for all children.\n  This Democratic amendment ensures the President and the Republicans \nin Congress live up to their commitments to fully fund programs like \nTitle I, English Language Acquisition, literacy programs, after school \nand rural education and that is why I am proud to cosponsor it.\n  We all know that there is no greater path to opportunity than \neducation. Unless we fully fund No Child Left Behind, millions of needy \nstudents will be denied the opportunity to achieve the American dream\n  I have visited schools across the great state of New York and I know \nfirsthand that our school districts are doing their part to help \nstudents learn at higher levels. Yet they continue to struggle with \ncritical funding shortages to fully serve all children in need.\n  The Murray-Kennedy amendment would help ensure that 4.6 million \nchildren get the quality education they need and deserve. For New York, \nthis funding will help close the $765.7 million gap in Title I funding \nbetween the funding proposed in the Republican budget and the amount \nthat was promised to my state when we passed No Child Left Behind. With \nthese resources, New York schools could decrease class sizes for \n834,117 students, expand preschool to 105,689 eligible children and \ncertify 102,740 teachers.\n  The more we hold off on funding these reforms, the more it will cost \nschool districts to meet the requirements to increase test scores and \nthe numbers of highly-qualified teachers. That is why we are falling \nfurther behind every year we fail to live up to that commitment.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to support the Murray-Kennedy \namendment.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I rise as a cosponsor to express my \nsupport for the amendment offered by my distinguished colleague from \nthe State of Washington, Mrs. Murray, and my distinguished colleague \nfrom the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, to fully fund the \nNo Child Left Behind Act and to improve overall funding for education \nand training programs. I believe it is critical that my colleagues in \nthe Senate adopt this amendment which represents a critical investment \nin America's future.\n  A little more than 2 years ago, in this Chamber, we made a bipartisan \ncommitment to leave no child behind. This landmark legislation has the \npotential to strengthen our public education system. It represents an \nambitious Federal effort to dramatically revitalize public education by \nclosing the achievement gap, making sure every classroom has a \nqualified teacher, and giving parents and students adequate choices to \nensure that their children receive a quality education. Adequate \nfunding, however, is essential in order to give our public schools the \nsupport and resources they need to implement the act, and to meet the \ngoals embodied therein.\n  The amendment before us will ensure that the budget resolution fully \nfunds the No Child Left Behind Act at its authorized level. We have all \nheard complaints with this law; the predominant one being that it is \nanother unfunded Federal mandate. Schools across the Nation are \nstruggling to meet the requirements of the law. However, they have been \nshortchanged by this President, and they are being shortchanged again \nby the budget resolution before us--shortchanged to the tune of $8.6 \nbillion. How can we expect our schools to embrace the act when their \nhands are tied by lack of funding? This issue has become so pronounced \nthat 18 States have considered a resolution that would grant them a \nwaiver from the law. I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment to \nassure our school systems will receive the funding levels they were \npromised when the law was enacted.\n  This amendment will signal to our schools and school districts that \nwe will meet our end of the bargain, in order to make public education \nin this country first class for every child in America. It will signal \nto our State and local education leaders that we will stand behind our \ncommitment to them, and give them the support they want and need to do \ntheir job for our children. The $8.6 billion being allocated by this \namendment can be used to ensure that we have highly qualified teachers \nin our classrooms, provide additional afterschool programs, send \nresources to schools identified as ``in need of improvement,'' supply \ntutoring and supplemental services, and give students specialized \ninstruction in reading and mathematics. It can also be used to leverage \nadditional State and local resources for public education in this \ncountry. Finally, I would like to point out that not only does this \namendment pay for itself, but it also dedicates an\n\n[[Page S2487]]\n\nadditional $8.6 billion for deficit reduction.\n  I commend the Senators from Washington and Massachusetts for offering \nthis amendment as an investment in our Nation's future. I am proud to \nbe a cosponsor. Our schools and students need adequate resources to \nmeet the high expectations that have been placed upon them. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I rise today in support of Senator \nMurray's amendment that, put simply, proposes to close unfair tax \nloopholes and use the funding closing them brings to fulfill the \npromises we made to the parents, teachers, principals, superintendents \nand, most importantly, our children. For the past hour, my colleagues \nfrom across the aisle have tried to put a different spin on this \namendment, claiming that it raises taxes to cover increased spending. \nThat is what they would like the American public to believe because \nthen their opposition to it is easier for them to explain. But the fact \nof the matter is, the underlying budget resolution now before us \nalready proposes that we close these very same tax loopholes, the only \ndifference is that under this budget the revenue generated would be \nused to pay for new tax cuts for corporations and millionaires. So it \nseems what we have here is a difference in priorities. Democrats are \nagainst tax evasion and for investments in education and Republicans \nare against tax evasion and for tax cuts for those who do not need \nthem. That is a choice I will leave to the American people come this \nNovember.\n  Two years ago, we challenged our schools to reject mediocrity and \nfailure and to embrace excellence and high standards. We laid out \nlegislation that provided a blue print for reform and we promised we \nwould be there every step of the way, in partnership, to bring about \nchange in our public schools. I was one of the 13 Members of the U.S. \nSenate who advocated for the kind of change embodied by the No Child \nLeft Behind Act long before it became a part of President Bush's \npolitical platform. I believe in the potential of this law, its \nfounding principles, and the direction it leads our Nation. It is by no \nmeans a perfect law. No law, in the history of Federal involvement in \neducation, has ever been perfect on the first try. But that does not \nmean we must abandon it and go back to the drawing board. What we must \ndo is come together to both fund it and fix it.\n  As the old saying goes, ``talk is cheap.'' Unfortunately, this \nadministration does pays a great deal of lip service to principles such \nas accountability, teacher quality, innovation and school choice, but \nare not willing to do a whole lot to be sure that these principles are \nreflected in the budget. For example, this administration says the \nfollowing when it comes to the importance of teacher quality. ``We know \nthat our children's future depends on their education. And the quality \nof their education depends on our teachers. Strong schools and quality \nteachers are the President's priorities,'' Laura Bush said on the First \nAnniversary of the Passage of NCLB.\n  Yet, what they do to fulfill the promise of a qualified teacher in \nevery classroom is a different matter. In this year's budget, President \nBush proposes to cut funding for Troops to Teachers and freezes funding \nfor grants to States to improve teacher quality. What this means is \nthat States like my own, are faced with the congressionally mandated \nchallenge of closing the gap in the number of qualified teachers, and \nhave had to try and meet this challenge with approximately $100 million \nless than they were promised.\n  The administration maintains that their goal is to improve public \nschools. In fact, in January of 2001, President Bush made the following \npromise: ``Once failing schools are identified, we will help them \nimprove. We'll help them help themselves. Our goal is to improve public \neducation. We want success, and when schools are willing to accept the \nreality that the accountability system points out and are willing to \nchange, we will help them.'' If this is not a promise, I am not sure \nwhat is. States like Louisiana believed in this promise and they \nbelieve in accountability. For the past 4 years they have been working \nhard to identify schools that were failing and turn them around. They \nhave done such an outstanding job that they were just recognized by \nEducation Week for having one of the best accountability systems in the \ncountry.\n  Is President Bush fulfilling his promise to support and encourage \nthese efforts? No. He is pulling the plug just when they need help the \nmost. This year's increase in education, which has been shrinking a \nlittle more every year since Bush took office, is the smallest increase \nin education spending in 7 years. What's worse, is that according to \nhis budget, next year, not coincidentally a year after the election, \neducation funding will be cut by $1.5 billion.\n  Our schools need more than lip service and empty promises, they need \nhelp. Now, I have asked the President and my Republican colleagues, why \nthe President would not provide States with the resources he promised \nwould be available to support their efforts. Here is what they tell me. \nThey say, ``Senator Landrieu, the President did not make any promises \nwhen it comes to funding, the funding levels listed in the law are just \ngoals. Congress never appropriates as much as they authorize.''\n  I think it is important for the American people to be able to \nseparate fact from fiction. Let me tell you what the facts are on this \npoint. When a program is a high enough priority for the President, you \ncan bet it will be funded. Let me give you some examples. Last year, \nCongress appropriated $1 billion for a program called the Millennium \nChallenge Account, a brand new foreign policy program proposed by the \nadministration. The President demanded $1 billion and he got a full \nbillion. Same was true for the tax package in 2003. Congress authorized \nthe passage of a $350 billion tax cut and we spent all $350 billion. \nMedicare, the Iraq Supplemental, the Compassion Capital Fund, the list \ngoes on and on.\n  The Secretary of Education claims that the reason for the decreased \nfinancial support from the administration is because States have too \nmuch money and are not even spending what they already have. In the \nwords of Ted Stilwill, the school chief from Iowa, ``The implication \nthat [States] have let huge sums of federal money languish that the \nfunds are at our disposal to use at our discretion, or that we have not \nbeen good stewards of the public's money is not only unfair, but \npatently insulting.'' Here are the facts: According to data from the \nU.S. Department of Education, States are actually spending their \nfederal money faster than expected. As of February 20, using normal \nspending rates, States should still be waiting to spend about 7 percent \nof their Federal education money from fiscal years 2000 to 2002. As a \nmatter of fact, States have spent all but 6 percent.\n  What our kids need is less excuse making, fewer empty promises, and \nmore leadership. In the words of President Bush himself, ``The time for \nexcuse making has come to an end Accountability for results is the law \nof the land.''\n  I would like to close my remarks this morning with one final \nPresidential quote. ``We possess all the resources and all the talents \nnecessary. But the facts of the matter are that we have never made the \nnational decisions or marshaled the national resources for such \nleadership. We have never specified long-range goals on an urgent time \nschedule, or managed our resources and our time so as to insure their \nfulfillment . . . Let it be clear that I am asking the Congress and the \ncountry to accept a firm commitment to a new course of action--a course \nwhich will last for many years and carry very heavy costs . . . [but] \nif we were to go only halfway, or reduce our sights in the face of \ndifficulty, it would be better not to go at all.''\n  Many of you may be saying to yourselves sounds like something \nPresident George Bush said when he urged Congress to pass the No Child \nLeft Behind Act, perhaps the most sweeping reform of Federal education \npolicy since 1965. But you would be wrong. This was from a speech given \nby another President making a historic challenge to the Nation. This is \nan excerpt from the famous ``Man on the Moon Speech'' delivered by \nPresident John F. Kennedy.\n  In 1961, President Kennedy presented a bold challenge to Congress and \nthe Nation: to reach for the stars, to put a\n\n[[Page S2488]]\n\nman on the moon within the next decade. Most thought he was over \nambitious, perhaps even crazy. It was such a large task, it could never \nbe done. Put a man on the moon in less than 10 years? In June on 1969, \n8 years and 1 month after this speech, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldren \nlanded on the moon and Neil Armstrong uttered the immortal phrase, \n``one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.''\n  The difference is that President Kennedy was not only willing to make \nthe challenge. He was willing to stand strong and provide the \nleadership and the resources necessary to meet it. In 1961, all tolled, \nthe United States was spending $1.6 billion, the equivalent of $8.7 \nbillion today on space programs. By 1966, just 5 years later, we were \nspending $7 billion, which is close to $30 billion in today's dollars. \nBut it was more than just money, he provided the leadership and the \nsupport. He made commitments and he stood by them. This program was \nmore than his speech for the day, it was a top priority. And it worked. \nHistory may have been very different if it hadn't.\n  In the words of the late President Kennedy, ``if we were to go only \nhalfway, or reduce our sights in the face of difficulty, it would be \nbetter not to go at all.'' We made a promise to our States, more \nimportantly, to our children. The Murray amendment fulfills that \npromise, it stays the course and that is why I am proud to support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield myself such time as I might consume off the 18 \nminutes remaining on this side.\n  Madam President, once again I remind the Senate about some of the \nissues that face the Senate Committee on Finance which I chair and how \ncertain assumptions being made by some of the amenders of the budget \nresolution might be affected by that or how their decisions might \naffect decisions we have to make.\n  First of all, there is the general proposition with all budgets and \nall amendments that pretend to dictate to committees where they ought \nto get the money or what legislation they ought to pass. This is just a \nrecommendation that has no force of law. It can be entirely ignored by \nany of the committees, including the Committee on Finance. So when \nthere is a premise certain loopholes ought to be closed, certain tax \nrate changes ought to be made to affect upper income limit people, the \npeople voting on this amendment and similar amendments ought to \nunderstand they are voting on numbers they are giving us, nothing else, \nbecause we will have to make those decisions not just on the substance \nof the dictates of the budget resolution but also on the responsibility \nto report a bipartisan bill.\n  We will have yesterday, today, and much more tomorrow, a whole series \nof amendments coming from the Democrat side of the aisle, trying to \ndictate something Democrats want Congress to accomplish, but with \nalmost no Republican support. The Senate Finance Committee cannot \nfunction under that sort of partisanship. We have to get things done in \na bipartisan way. If people who offer amendments to the budget expect \ntheir amendments to be adopted, it starts with bipartisanship. I have \nnot seen that in very many of the amendments we have had thus far. I \nguarantee, nothing will be done by the Senate Finance Committee in a \nstrictly partisan way. That is a dead end. That is an alley with no \nopening. We have to report a bipartisan bill if we expect to get it \nthrough the Senate.\n  The other thing I want my colleagues to understand, and why they \nshould vote against this amendment, is it assumes gaining certain \nrevenue from loophole closings. I can tell you of tens of billions of \ndollars we are going to get from closing loopholes, but we are doing \nthat because of the responsibility of the Senate Finance Committee, \nfirst of all, has to have a fair Tax Code, and secondly because we have \nthe obligation, if we are going to make tax changes, to have those \noffset. Without revenue neutrality we do not have bipartisanship, and \nwithout bipartisanship nothing is going to get through the Senate.\n  A lot of very popular tax provisions Democrats or Republicans expect \nme to get passed before this year is out, like the marriage penalty, \nlike the $1,000 tax credit for children, and the 10-percent bracket so \nwe can help low-income people pay less tax because they need that money \nthemselves to live rather than sending it to us to spend--both \nDemocrats and Republicans expect me to get that passed. We are going to \nuse the revenue from the loophole closings to fund those provisions. We \ncannot have that money spent on appropriated accounts. It has to be \nused to offset this social and economic policy that is involved in \ndoing away with the marriage penalty--the $1,000 child credit and the \n10-percent bracket, and even in addition to that, maybe, finding some \nbipartisan solution to bringing finality to what the estate tax ought \nto be in America as opposed to what it is now or what it will be in \n2011 when we go back to just the $1 million exemption.\n  Those are things we are going to do. Obviously, we ought to close \nthese tax loopholes and shelters because they are unfair. Some of them \nare outright schemes for corporations to avoid taxation. However, we \ncannot use that money twice. It will be used once. It will be used by \nour economy to establish a fair tax policy.\n  In addition to that, and unrelated to my position on the Senate \nFinance Committee, how I react to the debate we have had thus far on \nthis amendment--particularly when I hear some Senators on the other \nside say something like this: Don't tell me we have increased education \nspending by 60 percent, because I know that.\n  What that Senator wants us to hear is we have not appropriated what \nsomebody thought we ought to appropriate, which we seldom do anyway. I \nam well aware of that. I am well aware of promises that were made by an \nadministration on education expenditures, maybe in the first year of \nthis administration, but what I have not heard from the other side of \nthe aisle is, they decide how money ought to be divided, is what \nhappened on September 11 and the war on terror and how that changes \neverything. How has that changed everything?\n  You put your resources behind the men and women in battle. You put \nyour resources behind winning a war. That has caused the President of \nthe United States and the Congress, in turn, to divert some money from \ndomestic expenditures to the war on terror, to the Defense Department, \nand to homeland security. That is what is different now from the time \nwhen people thought this administration made certain promises on a lot \nof Federal programs, not just education.\n  It seems to me a responsibility we have when we overwhelmingly pass a \nresolution for war that, if we are going to put our men and women on \nthe battlefield, you have to give them all the resources it takes to \nwin that effort. If you do not, you should not be going to war.\n  Now, those who voted against that resolution may have the privilege \nof voting against funding our men and women in the battlefield, but it \nseems to me, regardless of whether you voted for the war resolution or \nnot, you have a responsibility to stand behind our men and women.\n  That is what has changed between promises being made on education and \ntoday. There has been a diversion of money. But even considering all \nthat, this administration, on the present budget and on previous \nbudgets, has put education No. 1, after the war on terror--including \nAfghanistan and Iraq--and after homeland security, because education is \nthe domestic program that gets the biggest increase in expenditures \nover anything else.\n  With that in mind, I ask that we defeat this amendment. I ask that it \nbe defeated because the revenue supposedly being used is the revenue we \nare going to use to make the Tax Code more fair to implement the social \nand economic policy we have that we call doing away with the marriage \npenalty, helping families, by keeping the $1,000 child credit, and \nhelping low-income people to pay less tax and to have more money in \ntheir pockets so they can support their families to a greater extent.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). Who yields time?\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask the Senator, could I have 2 minutes \noff the amendment?\n\n[[Page S2489]]\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I would be delighted to give the Senator \nfrom North Dakota 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized \nfor 2 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we have heard a lot of talk that the \namendment of the Senator from Washington raises taxes. Well, it does \nnot raise taxes on anybody except those who are engaged in the abuse of \ntax loopholes. Because that is what the amendment of the Senator from \nWashington provides: that tax loopholes are closed in the amount of \n$8.6 billion.\n  All this talk about middle-class tax relief has nothing to do with \nthis amendment--nothing. She is not talking about, in any way, \naffecting the 10-percent bracket or the childcare credit, or any of the \nother middle-class provisions--not at all.\n  The Senator from Wyoming indicated this is going to increase taxes on \npeople, on small businesspeople, on middle-class taxpayers. It is not. \nIt is aimed at tax loopholes.\n  Let's talk about the type of tax loopholes that one might consider. \nThere is now, across the land, a scam going on of enormous proportion. \nNew York has sold their subway system to a group of private investors, \nand then they turn around to lease it back, and the private investors \nget to depreciate the New York City subway system. New Jersey sold off \ntheir sewer system to private investors, which then depreciate the \nsewer system and then get away with a dramatic reduction in their \ntaxes. These are scams.\n  The administration, to its credit, has said we ought to close these \nloopholes. They think it will raise $33 billion. The amendment of the \nSenator from Washington is $8.6 billion to keep the promise of No Child \nLeft Behind--no tax increase, an end to scams.\n  It does not end there. The Joint Tax Committee did a thorough \nanalysis of the Enron scandal and found a series of abuses that could \nbe closed which would save billions of dollars in closing tax \nloopholes--no tax increase but stopping the scams.\n  And it does not end there. We have the spectacle of certain companies \nand certain wealthy Americans renouncing their U.S. citizenship--Mr. \nPresident, I ask for 30 seconds more, if I could.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield 30 seconds to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for an additional 30 \nseconds.\n  Mr. CONRAD. We have the spectacle of certain wealthy individuals and \nmajor corporations renouncing their U.S. citizenship to avoid U.S. \ntaxes. Closing down that loophole saves $3 billion.\n  Now, if anybody wants to vote against closing loopholes, let them \nvote against the amendment of the Senator from Washington. She is \nclosing those loopholes in order to fund our kids' education. That is \nexactly what we ought to do.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Senator from North Dakota for that \nclarification.\n  Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized for \n10 minutes.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I commend my colleague, the Senator from \nWashington, for her amendment, along with Senator Kennedy, and for her \ndedicated and lifelong efforts to improve the quality of education for \nall of our Nation's children. She has been a pioneer and a champion in \nthe Senate, as she has been in her career as an educator. She knows \nwhereof she speaks.\n  Once again, we are encountering the same old arguments from the other \nside of the aisle. Personally, I am tired of going back to 1993 or 1994 \nto try to explain or excuse what it is we are doing or not doing right \nnow for education in this country. I want us to do what is right for \nnow, to respond to the needs that exist now. I have said it in other \ndebates on education funding, and I will say it again: If President \nBush proposed more money than President Clinton, then President Bush \ndeserves that credit, in my eyes. If the 108th and the 107th Congresses \nprovided more money for education than previous Congresses, and more \nthan President Bush has proposed at times, then this Congress deserves \nthat credit, in my eyes.\n  But we are not doing this for ourselves. We are not trying to keep \nsome scorecard. We are not trying to fiddle around with percentages or \nother things. We are doing this for America's children.\n  The important question we ought to all be asking ourselves is, Are we \ndoing enough? Are we providing the money needed to do what we all said \nshould be done to leave no child behind?\n  That is this President's proclamation. He set that standard for us \nand for the country. That is the law we passed. It is a great standard. \nIt is an important standard, and we all seem to agree that should be \nthe standard. So the question we need to ask ourselves is, Are we \nbudgeting the money necessary to achieve that result?\n  When the Pentagon and Joint Chiefs of Staff have said they needed \nmore money to win the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, we have provided \nthat money, with bipartisan support, overwhelmingly.\n  When the President and Secretary Ridge have said they needed more \nmoney to protect our homeland, to provide protection and safety for all \nour citizens, we have done so on a bipartisan basis. Some of us, \nincluding Senator Murray, has urged we do more.\n  We have set the objectives in the Congress along with the \nadministration. We defined the standards of military victory and \nnational security, and we have provided the money necessary to succeed, \nbecause that is what is important, that we succeed at these most \nimportant goals we set for our Nation.\n  Now, we have also increased the Federal deficit enormously to do so. \nWe cut taxes very significantly, especially for the wealthiest people \nin this country. People whose annual income is greater than $1 million \nare receiving, this year, on average, a tax reduction of $113,000. It \nhas not bothered the majority enough to make any of those adjustments.\n  When I hear these concerns expressed about these onerous tax burdens \nthat are imposed on the superrich, the multimillionaires and \nbillionaires of America, or the large corporations that Senator Conrad \npointed out are not paying their fair share of taxes, not paying the \npercentage of their taxes owed as our small business owners pay, then I \nmust say, I think some of that is crocodile tears.\n  With all deference to the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, \nwhom I admire enormously and who has dealt with these matters, as \nsomebody who comes from--or at least before I got mixed up in \npolitics--the category of the wealthy, I would be glad to sit down with \nhim and go through it to discover how easily we can find the money to \npay for what he said he wants to do on taxes and what Senator Murray is \nproposing to do on education. It is not an either/or.\n  Nobody on this side wants to jeopardize the increase in the child tax \ncredit which was passed with overwhelming bipartisan support. In fact, \nit was originally a recommendation from this side of the aisle, but it \nhas bipartisan support. The same with eliminating the marriage penalty \nand expanding the 10-percent bracket. We are not going to do one thing \nto affect those extensions.\n  This is about education. Somehow that is treated differently by the \nother side. We can't close any of the tax loopholes. We can't allow the \nmillionaires or billionaires to escape one penny of taxes they owe. We \ncan't increase the deficit. Once again: Gee, we can't find the money we \nneed for education.\n  We are also told there is extra, unused money in the Federal pipeline \ngoing to State and local governments for public schools. I have heard \nthat in the years I have been here: Head Start has positions for kids \nthat are unfilled because there isn't a need or demand. Special \neducation has more money than they know what to do with. For No Child \nLeft Behind, there is more than enough money being provided.\n  When I tell this to educators and school board members and others in \nMinnesota who are involved with education, they think I am joking. They \nthink Congress must be seriously out of touch with reality. Where is \nthis pipeline, they ask, and if some States have more money than they \nneed or know what to do with, would they\n\n[[Page S2490]]\n\nplease send it on to Minnesota. I doubt my State is alone because all \nthe national organizations involved in these matters have said for \nyears, Head Start is being funded about half for the kids who are \neligible.\n  Again, Congress set these standards years ago. Congress defined what \nthe eligibility was for these programs. We are not making these numbers \nup out of whole cloth. We are supposed to be setting the measure of \nwhat qualifies a child for Head Start, the kids who need it.\n  Almost 30 years ago the Federal Government promised to pay for 40 \npercent of the cost of special education. It is less than half of that \ntoday. President Bush has increased it. This Congress has increased it \nevery year. Still it is less than half. So the question is not what is \nthe percentage; the question is, are we keeping a promise we made \nalmost 30 years ago. At least in Minnesota, when it is not being met, \nit has to be met, in most cases, with higher property taxes or cutbacks \nin the quality of education for all students.\n  Title I, again, is seriously underfunded and has been for years. In \nMinnesota's case, less than half the students are eligible by the \nFederal definition of what qualifies the child in poverty, with all \nthose disadvantages, for title I funding, the additional funding that \nis supposed to give that child the chance he or she deserves and \ncertainly is now entitled to by law under the President's initiative--\nless than half of those students in Minnesota, and we are going to lose \nmoney under the new formula.\n  In all these major areas of Federal Government responsibility for the \neducation of our children, we have been providing far less than enough, \nfar less than our own laws and our own statements of intent have called \nfor. I don't know whose fault it is. I don't think that is relevant. I \nknow whose responsibility it is today. That is what matters. It is our \nresponsibility. It is our responsibility to provide the funds necessary \nto fulfill our part of the bargain with States and local governments \nand school boards and the schools and, most importantly, with the \nchildren of America. If we are not willing to do that, then let's \nchange the law.\n\n  In Minnesota we have laws against consumer fraud. I would say if we \ndon't address these funding shortfalls, to call this No Child Left \nBehind violates the spirit at least of that law. If we are not going to \ndo more than we are doing now, let's at least have the honesty to tell \nthe truth to the American people. We didn't mean it. It sounds good; \ngreat slogan, but, sorry, it is not enough of a priority for us.\n  Tell the States: You come up with the money for these unfunded \nmandates, for the additional part of special education, which in \nMinnesota costs our schools about $250 million a year, real money. No \npipeline I am aware of can come up with that kind of money the schools \nin Minnesota need.\n  Let's tell school boards: Yes, you keep on raising local property \ntaxes in order to make up for what the Federal Government has promised \nbut isn't providing. Then let's have the honesty to tell the children, \nthe future of America: Sorry, you are not important enough.\n  I can only speak for Minnesota, but in my State schools are cutting \nclasses, opportunities. They are laying off teachers. Class sizes are \nincreasing; sports and extra curricular activities are being cut back. \nYou have to pay a special fee just to be a student. We know here in \nWashington that money is needed and should be spent and would be spent, \nbut, sorry, we are not going to provide it. We have other, more \nimportant priorities.\n  That is what the Murray amendment is about. It is a moment of truth \nfor this body, the Senate. Do we mean what we say, no child should be \nleft behind? Do we mean it? Are we willing to fund that as we funded \nother important national priorities, or is it not important enough in \nthe scheme of things to do what we promised to do?\n  Senator Murray has given this Senate, before the eyes of the Nation, \nthis moment of truth. What are our priorities? Do we keep our promises? \nDo we do what we know should be done and say must be done, and what \nevery child in America deserves to have done, which is provide the \nfunding necessary for quality education to leave no child behind?\n  I thank the Senator from Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Minnesota and \nall of our Democratic colleagues who have spoken. When the Senator from \nMinnesota was speaking, I couldn't help but think of someone he \nremembers well. During the whole debate of No Child Left Behind, \nSenator Paul Wellstone, who was on the floor during that debate saying: \nWe are giving a promise I don't believe we are going to keep. Everyone \nassured him: No, no, we will put this accountability in place. We will \nfund this.\n  The Senator from Minnesota speaks from his heart, as I know Senator \nWellstone would have admired him for, in reminding all of us what is \nhappening to our children and to our schools because we haven't kept \nthe promise all of us said we would keep when the debate took place \nseveral years ago.\n  How much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington has 8 minutes, and \nthe Senator from New Hampshire has 8 minutes 33 seconds.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, let me ask my colleague from New \nHampshire if he intends to use any more time on their side. I have a \nfew more minutes I would like to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has 8 minutes \n33 seconds remaining.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. And our side has 8 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seven and a half minutes now.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I was inquiring how much time the Senator from New \nHampshire intended to use, or if he wanted to go now.\n  Mr. GREGG. How much time does the Senator need to close?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I would like 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. I have no problem having the Senator close now and we can \ngo to a vote.\n  I am sorry. I can't do that. I guess I will speak for about 8 minutes \nand then yield to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, it has been a good debate. It certainly has \noutlined the issues involved. I want to reemphasize some points made by \nthe chairman of the Finance Committee who spoke about how the $17.2 \nbillion of tax increases in this amendment work. It is the only real \npart of this amendment.\n  The amendment represents it is going to take this tax increase and \nuse it to fund No Child Left Behind at the fully authorized level. It \ncan't do that for parliamentary reasons. It is unable to make that \nclear event within the amendment.\n  The only clear event within the amendment that does actually occur is \nthere is a $17.2 billion increase in taxes. The point which the \nchairman of the Finance Committee made, and which I think needs to be \nreemphasized, is those dollars could easily, if they are raised in this \nmanner, end up significantly impacting our ability to allow people who \nare now benefiting from no longer having to pay the marriage penalty; \nthose folks could end up paying the marriage penalty because we won't \nbe able to extend the relief from the marriage penalty tax.\n  If taxes are raised under this bill, those dollars could easily \nabsorb the money intended to be used for the purpose of addressing the \nissue of the child tax credit, which is a $1,000 tax credit. The \nextension of that might well be impacted. Those dollars, if this tax is \nput in place, could potentially impact the ability of this committee to \nfinance the continuation of the expansion of the 10-percent bracket for \nlow-income Americans so they have to pay less burden. Why is that? He \nmade the point, and I thought rather well, that that is because he \nintends to use the alleged loopholes recited here by my colleagues, \nwhich loopholes should legitimately be closed.\n  There is no reason people should be selling and leasing back the \nsubway system of New York, and the President supports making sure that \nloophole is closed. He intends to use that revenue in order to fund the \nability of people to get a child tax credit of $1,000, to avoid having \nto pay a penalty because they\n\n[[Page S2491]]\n\nget married, and to assist in expanding the 10-percent bracket.\n  As he makes the point, rather legitimately, if the dollars are \nsiphoned off from those loophole closures that are planned under the \nbudget, put in place, and are already in place and accepted as part of \nthis budget, if those dollars are siphoned off and end up flowing \npursuant to this amendment into a reserve account, he won't have the \ndollars available to him as chairman of the committee to accomplish \nthose tax relief efforts.\n  We are playing with some serious fire here. Basically, the risk of \nthis amendment is, No. 1, raising taxes $17.2 billion over what we need \nto do; but No. 2, it puts at risk the ability of the chairman to \naddress the use of the taxes that have been put in place in this budget \nthrough loophole closings to jeopardize the use of those taxes for the \npurpose of addressing the marriage tax penalty, the child tax credit, \nand the 10-percent bracket. A very important point.\n  Secondly, this amendment represents the goal is to fully fund No \nChild Left Behind at the authorized level. I believe we have discussed \nthis at some length, but I think it is worth emphasizing again. \nAuthorization numbers are guideposts. Rarely, as a Congress, have we \nmet authorization numbers. The proof is in the pudding.\n  The last time the Congress was controlled by the Democratic Party and \nthere was a Democratic President, title I was not funded to the full \nauthorization level. It was funded significantly below the authorized \nlevel. In fact, this President's commitment to funding education has \ndramatically outstripped the prior President's commitment or actions in \nthis area. I am sure he had a commitment, but he wasn't able to find \nthe dollars.\n  This President has made a huge commitment in the area of funding \neducation, and the dollar increase has been a billion dollars a year \nevery year--a billion, billion, billion, billion--cumulative billions \nfor the special education accounts, and a billion and a half to a \nbillion cumulatively for title I and for No Child Left Behind.\n\n  I see the chairman of the Finance Committee. I was trying to restate, \nprobably nowhere near as well as the chairman can, the effect of this \n$17.2 billion credit on his ability to do the extenders, which are so \nimportant to low-income families and married people and people with \nchildren.\n  I yield the remainder of our time to the chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized for 3 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank the Chair and I thank the Senator from New \nHampshire for his great leadership in dealing with education.\n  I spoke about the necessity of the Finance Committee having the \nfreedom to use revenue we can raise by closing these tax loopholes, and \nthe necessity of getting a bipartisan bill out of committee to do it. I \nthink the Senator from North Dakota spoke very well about some of the \nproblems we have with corporations and schemers and scammers using the \nTax Code to avoid taxation, by ridiculous things like leasing a subway \nfor a city in the United States, where there is no risk or economic \nsubstance to the process. We want to close those loopholes.\n  I thought I ought to bring to the attention of the Senate one of the \nbipartisan bills out of committee that was using some of those loophole \nclosings. They definitely have an impact upon some major industries and \njobs in this country where they are going to be hurt, because the World \nTrade Organization has ruled contrary to our trade agreements, the \nforeign sales corporation, and the extraterritorial income provisions \nwe have had to make to make our business competitive with European \nbusiness. Since that is ruled out, a lot of jobs in major \ncorporations--Microsoft and Boeing, to name a couple--are going to be \nhurt and be uncompetitive because of that.\n  We are taking some of the loophole closing money that is available to \noffset the revenue, to reduce corporate tax from 35 down to 32, so our \nbusinesses can be competitive. We can save jobs at Microsoft and Boeing \nwhich would otherwise be uncompetitive as a result of the foreign World \nTrade Organization ruling.\n  I don't want the Senate Finance Committee's hands to be tied by a \nscheme that thinks this money can be used four or five times and can be \nspent on domestic programs, when we have to have this money to offset \nvery important tax provisions we want to get passed. Saving jobs \nthrough this JOBS bill that was before the Senate last week, and will \nbe up again in 2 weeks, is an ideal place to use that revenue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield a minute to the Senator from \nNorth Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized \nfor 1 minute.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, let me just say the amendment of the \nSenator from Washington does nothing to raise taxes on middle-class \ntaxpayers, on wealthy taxpayers, on anybody but people who are engaged \nin tax scams and tax dodges, because her proposal is to close tax \nloopholes to the tune of $17 billion.\n  As we look in the budget, there is a relatively modest amount of \nmoney being raised to close tax loopholes. We know there are tens of \nbillions of dollars, according to the administration, in potential tax \nloopholes that could be closed.\n  In addition, let me say to my colleagues I met with the revenue \ncommissioner 2 weeks ago, who tells me the tax gap--the difference \nbetween what is owed and what is being paid--was $255 billion for 2001 \nalone. Let me repeat that. The tax gap--the difference between what is \nowed and what is being paid--is $255 billion for 2001 alone. There is \nplenty of money to be raised in tax loophole closings and the end of \ntax scams and the end of the tax gap to fully fund the amendment of the \nSenator from Washington and the middle-class tax relief all of us want \nto see continue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I know we are going to have a vote in a \nfew minutes. I will wrap up a few things. There has been a lot of stuff \nstrewn across the floor about this. We need to remember what this \namendment is all about. It is about keeping a commitment all of us made \nwhen we voted to pass No Child Left Behind.\n  We told our schools, essentially our children, our communities, our \nfamilies across this Nation that we were going to put in place \naccountability; that we wanted our students to learn, we wanted them to \nachieve, and we wanted them to be able to go on and get the skills they \nneeded to be out in the job market.\n  The Senator from Iowa talked about Microsoft and Boeing and making \nsure we can be competitive. The best thing for Microsoft and Boeing to \nbe competitive is to have an educated workforce of young people who \nhave the skills they need to come in and do the kinds of jobs to be \ncompetitive in an international marketplace.\n  When we passed the No Child Left Behind Act, we said we were going to \nput those standards out there, but that was a two-pronged promise, and \nthe other promise was to fully fund No Child Left Behind.\n  I have been amazed, sitting on the floor all morning listening to the \nother side say: We never intended to fully fund No Child Left Behind. I \nam shocked. I thought during the debate we had an agreement that we \nwould have accountability and that we would have funding. Now to come \nback 2 years later and say, We never intended to fully fund this act, \nwhat kind of promise is that to our children? We are going to make you \ntake tests and meet standards, and every year we are going to increase \nthose standards and we expect you to live up to it. But here in \nCongress we can get behind some kind of statement that we never \nintended to fully fund it? That doesn't fly in my home.\n  I think it is imperative that we face the American people and tell \nthem that when we in the Senate make commitments, we mean it. When we \nmake a promise to fund education, to make sure our students have the \nskills they need, and they can meet those accountability requirements, \nwe keep it. That is what this amendment is about. It is as simple and \nas clear as that.\n  I heard those on the other side argue that this is not a real \namendment. I\n\n[[Page S2492]]\n\nheard them say that it just sets up language. The language that I use \nin this amendment is the exact language that the other side has in the \nbudget to set up a reserve fund for transportation, to set up a reserve \nfund for Iraq and Afghanistan funding, to set up a reserve fund for \nfire suppression. Are those not real, either? If those are not real, \nthen I accept the argument that mine is not real. But if they want to \nstand out here and say we are fighting for fire suppression, that their \nbudget covers Iraq and Afghanistan, that their budget covers \ntransportation, then this amendment covers the No Child Left Behind \nfunding.\n  This amendment is real. It is exactly real. No one can hide behind \nthe fact it is not real. It is real to every child in every classroom \nacross this country.\n  There is a revolt going on in this country. Any Senator who has been \nhome and been in a school knows it. Any Senator who has talked with \nlegislators at their homes--and I know there have been discussions in \nVirginia, Utah, and many other States across the country--knows they do \nnot want this mandate anymore and to take off the handcuffs because we \nhave not funded it.\n  We have not lived up to our obligation to our children, to our \ncommunities, to our families, to our States, and to everyone else in \nthis world who cares about education because we have not funded this \nbill.\n  My amendment is basic and simple. It says we will follow up on a \npromise we made 2 years ago to fully fund No Child Left Behind. I am \nmore than at ease to go home and tell my constituents that I am \nfighting to make sure their children get a good education and we follow \nup on a promise. That is the decision every Senator is going to have to \nmake when they vote on this amendment. Whose side are you on, on the \nside of making sure we keep our promises, making sure our children have \nthe ability to learn and we do not just tell them they have to live up \nto standards, or on the side of hiding behind smoke and mirrors?\n\n  I intend to go home and tell my families in every community across \nthe State that I am going to fight every single day I am here to make \nsure their children have quality teachers, their children have quality \nclassrooms, their children have the ability to have good curriculum, \ntheir children are able to learn the skills they need from highly \nqualified teachers because that is what we promised them in this bill.\n  This amendment is about keeping promises. I urge my colleagues to \nvote for the Murray-Kennedy amendment. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 2719. The clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from South Dakota (Mr. Johnson) \nand the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would vote ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 46, nays 52, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 35 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--46\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham (FL)\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Kennedy\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--52\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham (SC)\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Johnson\n     Kerry\n       \n  The amendment (No. 2719) was rejected.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank our colleagues. We spent most of \nthe morning on one amendment. I discussed this with my friend and \ncolleague from North Dakota and said I know a lot of Members have \neducation speeches they want to make. We were pretty generous with time \nallotments for those amendments. But I really want to tell our \ncolleagues that generosity with time is coming to a close. We are going \nto start picking up the pace rather substantially. That means we are \ngoing to have a lot more votes. It means I am doing everything I can to \navoid a vote-arama which Senator Byrd and I have discussed many times. \nWe think it is demeaning to the Senate to have a large number of votes \nwhere Members are voting with almost no debate. We are making a great \nconcession on our side. It is easy to debate and say now the time is up \nand have a vote-arama. I think that is demeaning to the Senate.\n  I have discussed this with my colleague, Senator Conrad. We are \nwilling to consider more amendments with time agreements, have a \nshorter debate time, and try to dispose of amendments so we can avoid \nthe necessity of being here very late Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and/\nor Saturday. We are going to complete the bill. But let us try to \ncooperate, Democrats and Republicans, proponents and opponents. We all \nhave various issues on these amendments, but we are going to have to \nmove quickly. That last rollcall vote was 25 or 26 minutes. The time \nlimit is 15. I expect to be calling for regular order shortly after 15 \nminutes. We have three or four very significant amendments that will be \ncoming up. Senator Byrd, I believe, is going to offer an amendment \ndealing with striking reconciliation. I believe Senator Stevens and \nSenator Warner may be offering an amendment on defense. Excuse me. \nSenator Lindsey Graham and Senator Bunning have an amendment we hope to \nbe able to accept. That shouldn't take too long. Senator Byrd has an \namendment on reconciliation. We expect an amendment dealing with \ndefense. We expect an amendment dealing with pay-go. Those are three or \nfour major issues. We might stack the votes. I will consult with my \ncolleague from North Dakota as far as the timing of the votes.\n  We have had a significant debate. It is time for us to dispose of \nthese amendments so we can avoid the so-called vote-arama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, might I add my voice to the voice of the \nchairman. We are rushing toward another vote-arama. We have 58 \namendments noticed on this side already. Some of them are duplicative. \nOn some of them, one Senator is offering many more than one amendment. \nI am asking our colleagues to please let us exercise discipline. Let us \nreduce the number of amendments. I propose to my colleague that we \nconsider entering into a time agreement at least on these next few \namendments. If we could agree, for example, on 30 minutes or 40 minutes \nequally divided on the next amendment, and then an hour equally divided \non an amendment on reconciliation, then an hour on an amendment at the \ndesignation of the chairman, and then an hour equally divided on pay-\ngo, and stack the votes, we could then have a series of three votes at \nabout 5:45 which might accommodate some. I know there are plans for \nthis evening by some. At least we could get a series of important votes \nconcluded.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague's excellent \nsuggestion. I am not ready to enter into a consent on all of those \namendments. I think the Senator from South Carolina has indicated he \nwants 45 minutes on his amendment. I am willing to enter\n\n[[Page S2493]]\n\ninto an agreement on Senator Byrd's amendment. I don't think I am ready \nto go yet on the Stevens-Warner amendment. I need to consult with them \nfirst. If we can enter into an agreement on those two amendments, I am \nhappy to do that.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to enter into an agreement of 45 minutes \nequally divided on the Graham amendment and an hour equally divided on \nthe Byrd amendment.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I have no objection.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I am not yet \nready to enter into an agreement on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, our order would be then to consider the \namendment offered by Senator Graham and Senator Bunning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the next order of \nbusiness is the amendment of the Senator from South Carolina, Senator \nGraham.\n  The Senator is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2731\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, I send an amendment to \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Graham], for himself, \n     Mr. Daschle, Mr. Bunning, Mr. Leahy, Mrs. Clinton, and Mr. \n     DeWine proposes an amendment numbered 2731.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat reading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I think we might have it worked out so we can \nenter into a time agreement on the next two amendments, if the chairman \nwould be willing to repeat the request.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment by Senator Lindsey Graham and Senator Bunning be limited to \n45 minutes without second-degree amendments, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that the amendment to be offered by Senator Byrd be limited to \n1 hour equally divided without second-degree amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

RESERVE FUND FOR GUARD AND RESERVE HEALTH CARE.\n\n       If the Committee on Armed Services or the Committee on \n     Appropriations reports a bill or joint resolution, or an \n     amendment thereto is offered or a conference report thereon \n     is submitted that expands access to health care for members \n     of the reserve component, the Chairman of the Committee on \n     the Budget may revise allocations of new budget authority and \n     outlays, the revenue aggregates, other appropriate \n     aggregates, and the discretionary spending limits to reflect \n     such legislation, providing that such legislation--\n       (1) would not increase the deficit for fiscal year 2005 and \n     for the period of fiscal years 2005 through 2009, or would \n     offset such deficit increases through reduction of \n     unobligated balances from Iraqi reconstruction; and\n       (2) does not exceed $5,600,000,000 for the period of fiscal \n     years 2005 through 2009.\n\n     SEC. 305.

Mr. President, I will give a quick \noverview and yield to Senator Bunning for as much time as he needs to \nexplain his portion of the amendment. Then we will go to Senator DeWine \nand Senator Daschle and myself to finish.\n  I compliment Senator Nickles for helping us work this out. This is \nthe amendment we have been talking about for almost a year now, setting \naside some money in the budget to address the health care needs of the \nGuard and the Reserve.\n  If you are an activated member of the Guard or Reserve, you go into \nthe military health care system called TRICARE. Your family has \neligibility for that system. When you come off active duty, you will go \nback into your private plan, if you have one. If you are uninsured, \nthere will no plan available for you.\n  We are trying to allow Guard and Reserve members, by paying a premium \nout of their pockets, to be full-time members of TRICARE so they will \nhave continuity of health care.\n  Twenty-five percent of the people who were called to active duty for \nGuard and Reserve were unable to be deployed because of health care \nproblems. Providing continuity of health care year round would be a \ngood measure. I know this will help retention and recruiting.\n  There is another aspect of this amendment, thanks to Senator Bunning. \nWhat is happening with our Guard and Reserve forces is they are \nbecoming overutilized. There has been a 170-percent increase in Guard \nand Reserve utilization since 9/11.\n  The GI bill of rights applies to the Guard and Reserve in a limited \nfashion. Thanks to Senator Bunning's efforts, that is about to change.\n  At this time, I would like to yield to Senator Bunning to explain \nwhat he is trying to do for the Guard and Reserve members with an \namendment in terms of the GI bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, my amendment provides funds to increase \neducational benefits for the National Guard and Reserve members under \nthe GI bill. Currently, National Guard and Reserve members are eligible \nfor only $282 per month under the GI bill. That is only 27 percent of \nthe amount active-duty members can get.\n\n  In 1985, Congress set educational benefits for our Guard and Reserve \nmembers at 47 percent of the active-duty\n\n[[Page S2494]]\n\nbenefit level. Since then, it has continued to slip to today's levels \nof 27 percent. My provision provides the funds needed to bring Guard \nand Reserve benefits back to that 40-percent mark.\n  Today, we are using our National Guard and Reserve, as Senator Graham \nsaid, more than ever. They are being deployed away from their homes and \nfamilies for longer periods of time and put in harm's way. We should \nprovide them with educational benefits that reflect the contributions \nthey make to our national security.\n  I urge Members to support the Graham amendment.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, I thank Senator Bunning \non behalf of all the Guard and Reserves. He has made a real difference \nin their lives. This is long overdue. I appreciate what the Senator has \ndone to make this a better amendment.\n  I yield 3 minutes to Senator Leahy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am glad to join my colleagues Senator \nDaschle of South Dakota and Senator Graham of South Carolina in support \nof this critical budget amendment on the readiness of our National \nGuard and Reserves. This amendment will allocate resources in the \ncountry's long-term budget to implement a comprehensive health \ninsurance program for the 800,000 citizen-soldiers who serve in the \nNational Guard and Reserves.\n  Last year, the Senate recognized that 20 percent of the Nation's \nmilitary reserve--over 150,000 citizens waiting to answer the call-to-\nduty--did not possess health insurance. During a vote here on the \nSenate floor, 85 senators collectively agreed that this was unwise, and \nmore importantly, unconscionable that citizen soldiers ready to fight \nfor their country would arrive for service in less than perfect health \nbecause they were uninsured.\n  As a response to this clear problem, we passed a stopgap health \ninsurance program that allowed reservists to receive fully reimbursed \nhealth insurance through TRICARE as soon as they received their orders \nand maintain that insurance after they had been deactivated.\n  The centerpiece of the program passed in Congress last year was a \nprovision to allow drilling members of the Guard and Reserve to buy \ninto the TRICARE program on a cost-share basis if they were between \njobs or did not have access to health insurance through their \nemployers.\n  This program guarantees that every member of the Guard and Reserve is \ncovered either through TRICARE or a civilian program. However, the \nfinal defense bill last year authorized the program only through the \nend of this calendar year. This amendment would expand funding for this \nprogram for the next 5 years.\n  More troubling, critical portions of our original proposal, embodied \nin S. 852, the Comprehensive Guard and Reserve Health Benefits Act, \ndropped out during the final negotiations.\n  Missing in the final package was eligibility for employed members of \nthe Guard and Reserve to sign up for the cost-share TRICARE program. \nThis took away health insurance options for our reservists and a \nnecessary mechanism to make the mobilization process easier by \neliminating the need for reservists to switch back and forth between \nhealth insurance plans when they are activated.\n  The final compromise also shortchanged families of activated \nreservists who wanted to maintain their civilian health insurance while \ntheir loved ones were activated.\n  That provision would have substantially reduced some of the intense \ndisturbances these long separations create. We crafted this provision \nto have only marginal costs compared to the size of the benefit for \nGuard members, reservists and their families.\n  This amendment will help fund the full program set forth in S. 852: \nEarly health insurance, TRICARE access for all, reimbursements to \nfamilies for keeping civilian health insurance, and maintaining full \nTRICARE after deployment. It truly is a comprehensive package. It is, I \nwant to note, the exact same legislation that received an overwhelming \n85 to 10 favorable vote during our debate on the defense bill.\n  The Department of Defense has slow-rolled implementation of the \nprogram turned into law last year. They are still not opening up the \ncost-share program to eligible service-members. Passing this amendment \nthis year on the budget resolution sends a signal to DOD that they need \nto move ahead more aggressively. But, more importantly, this amendment \nassures the 130,000 men and women in the Guard and Reserve serving in \nIraq, Afghanistan, or at home, and the entire Guard and Reserve force, \nthat we are going to take significant steps to ensure that they are \nready to meet the challenges ahead. We are not going to let our Guard \ndown.\n  To reiterate, this amendment will allocate resources in the long-term \nbudget to implement a comprehensive health insurance program for the \n800,000 citizen soldiers who serve in the National Guard and Reserve.\n  We recognized in the Senate last year that 20 percent of the Nation's \nmilitary reserve--over 150,000 citizens waiting to answer the call to \nduty--did not possess health insurance. Think of that, over 20 percent \nof the military reserve, 150,000 people, with no health insurance. That \nis unwise and it is also unconscionable these citizen soldiers do not \nhave health insurance.\n  We passed a stopgap health insurance program that allowed reservists \nto receive fully reimbursed health insurance through TRICARE as soon as \nthey receive their orders and maintain that insurance after they have \nbeen deactivated.\n  Missing in the final package was eligibility for members of the Guard \nand Reserve to sign up for the cost-share TRICARE program. We have \ncrafted a provision at only marginal cost compared to the size for \nmembers of the Guard and Reserve, and this will help fully fund the \nprogram set forth--early health insurance, TRICARE access for all, \nreimbursements to families for keeping civilian health insurance, and \nmaintaining full TRICARE after deployment.\n  We need to do this. We cannot continue to ask these men and women to \ngo overseas to serve, basically full time, and have part-time benefits. \nThey are full-time soldiers. They should be treated that way.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. I yield 10 minutes to the chief author \nof this legislation, Senator DeWine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I am proud to join this afternoon my \ncolleague, Senator Lindsey Graham, in support of this very important \namendment. I commend him for his great leadership and great work.\n  I have been a longstanding supporter of both initiatives: extending \nTRICARE coverage to members of the Guard and Reserve, and also \nincreasing the level of benefits provided to the Selective Reserve \nunder the Montgomery GI bill. I have introduced and cosponsored several \nbills to address existing inequities with these specific benefits.\n  Unfortunately, benefits for our Guard and Reserve simply have not \nkept pace with the increasing role that these individuals are expected \nto play today.\n  I commend Senator Graham, Senator Daschle, and Senator Bunning for \ntheir great leadership and their continued commitment to these \ninitiatives. I look forward to working with them through the coming \nmonths to make these important initiatives a permanent reality.\n  This is important work. I know of nothing more important that this \nSenate will be doing in the months ahead. I look forward to making sure \nwe get the job done.\n  I thank my colleague for the time this afternoon to talk about \nanother important amendment that I have filed, but I am not calling up \nat this time. I take a moment to talk about this amendment that is \ncosponsored by Senator Leahy and Senator Coleman, an amendment that I \nhave sponsored.\n  We live in a world of 6 billion people, the majority of whom live in \ndeveloping countries. Theirs is a world where, according to UNICEF, out \nof every 100 children born, 30 will most likely suffer from \nmalnutrition in their first 5 years of life; 26 will not be immunized \nagainst the most basic of childhood diseases; and 19 will lack access \nto clean, safe drinking water.\n  This is certainly unconscionable. Yet we have seemingly come to \nexpect and indeed accept this as a way of life in the developing world. \nThe tragedy is\n\n[[Page S2495]]\n\nthat all of this is avoidable. We can do something about it. We can do \nsimple things, really simple things, basic things that can save \nmillions of children's lives every year. The reality is we are not \ndoing enough right now. Candidly, we are tolerating these deaths, and \nsaving these lives simply has not been a priority. Our amendment would \nchange that. And it is, indeed, a step in the right direction.\n  I take a few minutes this afternoon to share some important \nstatistics about child and maternal mortality. I am often hesitant to \ncome to the floor and talk about statistics. When we hear statistics, \nit is all too easy to become numb, all too easy to forget the human \nrealities they, in fact, represent. It is important for all to listen \nto some of these statistics today because they are so unbelievable and \nso tragic. They represent so many lives, countless lives that could, in \nfact, be saved; lives that could be saved if we would make the \nappropriate amount of resources available to people who are in such \ndire need.\n  Let's look at the facts. Today, over 10 million children under the \nage of 5 die each year from preventable, avoidable, and treatable \ndiseases and ailments, including such things as diarrhea, pneumonia, \nmeasles, and, yes, malnutrition. Over 10 million children under the age \nof 5 die from preventable and avoidable diseases. Of those 10 million \ndeaths worldwide, 3.9 million occur in the first 28 days of life. These \nbabies do not even have a shot at living their lives or even getting as \nold as 2, 3, 4 or 5. Yet two-thirds of these deaths could be prevented \nif available and affordable interventions had reached the children and \nmothers who needed them.\n  Malnutrition contributes to 54 percent of all childhood deaths, and \nas many as 3 million children die annually as a result of vitamin A \ndeficiency. An estimated 400,000 cases of childhood blindness are \nreported each year, also, because of vitamin A deficiencies.\n  According to the World Health Organization estimates, at least 30 \nmillion infants still do not have access to basic immunization \nservices, and over 4.4 million children died from vaccine-preventable \ndiseases in the year 2001 alone--diseases such as hepatitis, polio, and \ntetanus. Of all the vaccine-preventable diseases, measles remains the \nleading childhood killer, claiming the lives of, it is estimated, \n750,000 children--more than half of them in Africa alone. Yet vaccine-\npreventable deaths could actually be cut in half by the year 2005 if \nthese children were receiving proper vaccinations.\n\n  Mr. President and my colleagues in the Senate, we can change the \ncourse of these developing nations. We can change this tragic human \nreality. We can start by providing additional money and support for our \nchild survival and maternal health programs. The fact is, this is an \nemergency situation. There really is not any other way to describe it. \nOver 10 million children dying each year from preventable and treatable \nillnesses certainly qualifies as an emergency.\n  It is the equivalent of roughly 55 fully loaded 747 airplanes \ncrashing every day for a year. Think of that. If that were happening, \nif that many airplanes were going down each day in this country, or \nanywhere in the world, we know what our reaction would be. It would be \nall over the news, all over CNN. We would declare a worldwide tragedy, \nand we would do something about it.\n  But these problems facing the developing world cannot be resolved \nthrough short-term, temporary, piecemeal assistance. If we are to make \nany real headway in improving the health of women and children in the \nlong term, we need to take some bold and radical steps, and we also \nneed to be committed to supporting, in the long run, maternal and child \nhealth programs, and not just now but next year and the year after and \nthe year after that. Our funding simply cannot be administered in a \nsingle dose.\n  If we could look into the future 10, 20, 30, 40 years from now, we \nwould see what is possible with sustained investments in primary health \ncare and public health systems.\n  An article recently published in the journal, The Lancet, suggests \nthat providing, for example, vitamin A as a preventing measure could \navert as many as 225,000 deaths, and providing oral rehydration therapy \ncould prevent as many as 1,477,000 deaths. Simple interventions and \ntreatment are not expensive. Oral rehydration salt packets cost about 8 \ncents apiece--8 cents.\n  For 4 cents per child, two vitamin A capsules could be given every \nyear to children around the world, saving over 650,000 of them from \nblindness and death. For 30 cents worth of basic antibiotics given to \nevery child with pneumonia, we could prevent 577,000 deaths. I think \nyou get the idea.\n  Here is another example: Iodine regulates growth and the metabolism. \nA deficiency in iodine is the primary cause of preventable learning \ndisabilities and brain damage. Iodine can be introduced into the diet \nby something as simple as fortified salt--iodized salt--something that \nis in all our kitchens at home. This simple measure would cost only 5 \ncents per person annually.\n  Furthermore, our amendment would allocate additional money to help \navert maternal and neonatal death and improve maternal health, \nincluding the prevention of obstetric fistulas and other types of \ninjuries and disabilities resulting from childbirth in unsafe \ncircumstances.\n  The fact is, all pregnant women are at risk for injuries and \nchildbirth complications, which is why it is so important to have \nskilled attendants--midwives, doctors, or nurses--present at birth. Yet \nonly about half of the world's women give birth with a skilled \nattendant available.\n\n  The child survival and maternal health funding provides resources so \nthat USAID can provide training and technical assistance in infection \nprevention and quality of care, as well as needed equipment and \nsupplies to bring health facilities up to a level where they can \nprovide safe and effective emergency pre- and postnatal care. Clearly, \nchild survival interventions do, in fact, work, and they are the most \ncost-effective tools we have in the struggle for better global health.\n  We can and we should invest in these programs as they increase \ndeveloping countries' access to basic health services--services such as \nvaccinations, immunizations, micronutrient programs, and vitamin \nsupplements.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask for an additional 1 minute.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Absolutely.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for an additional \nminute.\n  Mr. DeWINE. If we can make these investments and work toward equal \naccess to health care, we can help ensure that mothers receive proper \nprenatal care, that children and families receive nutritional \ncounseling and vitamin supplements, and that children receive the \nnecessary immunizations and vaccinations to live healthy lives.\n  But tragically, if we fail to make a sufficient and sustained \ninvestment in the development of public health systems that provide \nprimary care, mothers will continue to die prematurely during \nchildbirth, children will continue to die from preventable diseases and \ncauses, and life expectancies in these developing nations will stagnate \nor perhaps even decrease. This is not acceptable.\n  Mr. President, adoption of this amendment--as I said, it has been \nfiled but not yet called up--will go a long way to save so many \nchildren's lives around the world. Therefore, I would ask my \ncolleagues, when this amendment is called up, to join my colleagues in \nvoting in favor of it.\n  Again, I thank my colleague for his great work to help our Guard and \nReserves in relation to what we talked about earlier today. I thank him \nfor his good work in this area.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, we are all in a thanking \nmode, and I think it is appropriate that we try to do as much as we \ncan, in a bipartisan fashion, when it comes to the military.\n  We will have our differences and funding and our differences about \npriorities in terms of what helps the economy and what helps to control \nthe deficit. But I want to acknowledge the work of Chairman Nickles' \nstaff and him personally for allowing this amendment to be accepted as \npart of the budget because working together, in a bipartisan fashion, \nwe are going to\n\n[[Page S2496]]\n\ncarve out about $5.6 billion to be utilized to help alleviate the Guard \nand Reserve health care problems that currently exist. And Senator \nBunning's measured, upgraded GI bill benefits will also be part of the \nbudget. To me, that is a good priority to have made. We have promised \nto pay for this. I think that is a good statement to have made, too.\n  Once the authorizing committee gets to work with Senator Warner, and \nthen, hopefully, Senator Stevens, who has been a big champion of this \ncause, they will appropriate what we do on the authorizing committee, \nthat it will be paid for, and that we can bring this program in under \nthe $5.6 billion amount. Senator McCain and others have ideas of how \nthe employer community can contribute.\n  But I would like to inform those maybe listening in the Guard and \nReserve community that your needs are well understood by this body, and \nthere is a real bipartisan effort to meet those needs.\n  To those in the Active Forces, I think we have tried to upgrade your \nbenefit package, tried to increase your pay. You have earned every \npenny of it, and then some. We are trying to improve the quality of \nlife of those people stationed overseas and their families.\n  This is a team effort. Nothing about the Guard and Reserve takes away \nfrom the Active Forces. Forty percent of the people in Iraq, by the end \nof the year, will be Guard and Reserve members. When a guardsman or \nreservist is called to active duty, it has its own unique stress. God \nknows their is stress on our active-duty families who are serving in \nthe military and have their family members in harm's way.\n  More times than not, when you are called to active duty, your pay \ngoes down. There are provisions in our Federal law that will allow some \nrenegotiating of loans but, at the end of the day, it is a very \nstressful event financially for families.\n  This one aspect, health care, is a huge problem that needs to be \naddressed. As I stated before, about one in four people called from the \nReserve and Guard community to active duty are not able to be deployed \nimmediately because of health care problems. The No. 1 disqualifying \nevent is dental problems.\n  When you think about it, a lot of private plans do not have a dental \ncomponent to it. So by allowing Guard and Reserve members to be part of \nthe military health care system year round, whether they are deployed \nor not, I think readiness goes up dramatically.\n  When we look at writing this bill, that would be one of the selling \npoints. I was in Iraq last summer with a delegation of Senators. The \nPresiding Officer was with us. It was a wonderful opportunity to \nunderstand how difficult service overseas can be and how stressful it \nis being in harm's way. You come away with a great sense of pride about \nall those serving our country. As the Presiding Officer will recall, we \nhad nine C-130 flights in Afghanistan and Iraq. Eight of the nine crews \nwere Guard crews. The last was a Reserve crew. All the 130 crews were \nfrom the Guard and Reserve community. That duplicates itself in many \nother areas--MPs, civil affairs. There is a heavy reliance on Guard and \nReserves.\n  I remember on one of the flights the pilot and the copilot were going \nto be first-time dads. One person worked for Southwestern Bell. \nSouthwestern Bell voluntarily extended health care coverage for the \nfamily, even though he was called back to duty, so that person's wife \ndid not have to change doctors or hospitals. The copilot was a realtor \nand he didn't have such an opportunity. So his wife had to change \ndoctors and hospitals late in the pregnancy, and it was a very \nstressful event.\n  One thing about providing full-time TRICARE eligibility to those who \nwant to pay the premium, we are asking guardsmen and reservists to \ncontribute to the cost. That is only fair, and it is a very good deal. \nThey will be contributing out of their pocket, like their active-duty \ncounterparts. One of the benefits is, your family doesn't have to \nbounce around from one health care provider to another, even when you \nchange plans. Some people have been deployed already three times. The \nlikelihood of their utilization in the future is greater, not less. \nAdopting this amendment as part of the budget allows us to take some \nmoney to meet those needs.\n  I need to say this about Senators Daschle and Leahy and Clinton, and \nour other Democratic sponsors: We wouldn't be here without Senator \nDaschle. I don't know how to say it any clearer. We would not have made \nit this far if he had not taken on this cause and pushed as hard as he \ncould push. He has been around here a lot longer than I have. It really \ndid matter. He and I may vote differently for the rest of the week, but \nI have great admiration for him as a person and we will vote together \ntoday. At the end of the week he may have a different view about what \nthe budget does for the country, but we will have agreement on this, \nthat the Guard and Reserve community is one step closer to getting the \nhelp they deserve. I publicly acknowledge that and thank him. It has \nbeen a very pleasurable, enjoyable experience. We are not there yet, \nbut we are closer than when we began.\n  I am the only Member of the Senate who is in the Reserves. I recently \ngot promoted and made a joke about that, showing how stressed out we \nare in the military if I am promoted. I am proud of my service. I have \nnever been in harm's way.\n  The one thing I got from that experience, having been on Active Duty \nfor 6\\1/2\\ years, serving overseas--I was in the Guard as a support \nperson in Alaska, doing legal work for families and military members \nbeing deployed--I know how stressful it is for families left behind and \nhow stressful it is for the pilots and their crews.\n  Here we are 10 years later plus, involved in another major operation \nto fight the enemies of this country who, if they had their way, little \ngirls wouldn't to go school and there would be only one way to worship \nGod. It would be their way. And if you differed, you would die.\n  This is a huge event we are undertaking, the war on terrorism. The \nGuard and Reserve community is playing a bigger role than ever.\n  The cold war dynamic with the Guard and Reserve has changed with the \nwar on terrorism. They are indispensable. That will not change anytime \nsoon. The stress on the forces is as great as it has ever been in my \nmilitary career, and the benefit package has not been changed \nsubstantially in 30 years. Now is the time to come together, \nRepublicans and Democrats, and put on the table new benefits for those \nserving their country in a very patriotic and unselfish way.\n  With that, I yield to the minority leader and my colleague on this \neffort, Senator Daschle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the Senator for his kind words. I have to say, \nthis has been an equal joy for me. The Senator from South Carolina has \nbeen an extraordinary partner in this effort. I applaud him for the \nextraordinary efforts he has made to get us to this point and the \nleadership he has provided. As he has noted, we may disagree on other \nissues, but on this there is very strong bipartisan support. I cite his \nleadership as one of the reasons why.\n  I can speak for all of those on this side of the aisle who have \nworked to try to pass this legislation. Senator Graham's efforts, his \npersistence, and the extraordinary effort he brings to ensuring we \nsucceed is a big reason why we are going to be successful today.\n  We have actually voted on this three times in the Senate. We have \ndone so with overwhelming margins. It is not often on an amendment that \nyou can generate 80-plus votes. But 87 Senators have already said this \nought to be law. Because they have said it ought to be law, we are \nconfident it will become law sooner or later.\n  The legislation we are offering today very simply recognizes, first, \nthat there are differences between members of the Reserves and the \nActive Duty. The Active Duty don't have to pay for their health care. \nWe believe that is the way it should be. If you are on active duty and \nyou are defending your country, that ought to be one of the \nprerequisites of Active-Duty service. We are suggesting that if you \nserve your country alongside that member of the Active Duty, you ought \nto have access to that health care, and maybe you ought to pay a little \npremium.\n\n[[Page S2497]]\n\n  Our guardsmen and reservists are determined and are accepting of that \ndifference. They just want access to the care. They are willing to pay \na premium, unlike our Active-Duty personnel who get it as part of their \njob, but they do want access. So that is the first big difference.\n  Clearly, what most people don't understand is this premium is a very \nsignificant differentiation between Active-Duty personnel and the \nGuard.\n  The second is, this will not be taken out of the Pentagon budget. \nWhat we are proposing with this amendment is we add $5.6 billion. We \nrecognize there are some very important needs within our defense budget \nthat have to be met. We don't want to see this compete with other \nneeds, and that is why we are adding on. But we are also not adding to \nthe deficit. There is a significant unobligated balance in the Iraq \nreconstruction fund, money that would go to Iraq normally, that is not \ngoing to be required in this fiscal year from which this money is \ntaken.\n  So first, we are not exacerbating the deficit. Secondly, we are not \ncompeting with any other programs in the Defense Department. And third, \nwe recognize the difference between members of the Reserve and Active-\nDuty personnel. So for all those reasons, we think this amendment is \nvery carefully drawn.\n  Obviously, there is no question about the importance of what it does. \nIt extends coverage to all reservists who are willing to pay the \npremium. You pay the premium; you have access to the health insurance. \nSecondly, we provide offsetting coverage when people are called up and \nthey have private coverage that they want to maintain. We are saying, \nif you are called to service by your country and you are fighting in a \nfaraway land, we are going to ensure that if you have private coverage \nthat you think is important and you want to keep for your family, you \nought to have a right to do that.\n\n  Finally, we make it permanent. We ought to take out the guessing \ngame. There shouldn't be any question as to whether it is going to be \nhere this year, gone the next, whether some people are going to have to \nsign up, worrying whether they can sign up in subsequent years.\n  What Senator Graham suggests with our amendment is, No. 1, it ought \nto be permanent. We have seen, as the Senator from South Carolina so \naptly noted, the biggest callup of members of the Guard and Reserves \nsince World War II. Our dependence upon the Guard and Reserves \ncontinues to grow. Forty percent is now the number that is widely \nrecognized; 40 percent of those serving in Iraq are members of the \nGuard and Reserves. So there is no question this integration of forces \nis a fact of life.\n  If we are going to see this integration of forces in the future, we \nhave to recognize that we are going to have to change our benefits and \npay structure to meet the demand and to put some element of fairness \nback into the system.\n  This amendment is needed for two reasons. One, it is the right thing \nto do. When you have 30 percent of those members of the Guard and \nReserves who are called up today who have no health insurance, many of \nwhom can't even get the kind of health care they need to be compliant \nphysically with the demands of their job, you need this amendment.\n  Secondly, when you look down the road and you talk to Governors and \nthe Guard and Reserve decisionmakers, what they will tell you \nprivately, and for good reason, is they are understandably concerned \nabout retention, understandably concerned about meeting the needs.\n\n  You will not find more patriotic Americans anywhere than those who \nserve through the Reserve and the Guard. Nobody is more committed. They \ngive up their jobs, time with their families, and they go to faraway \nplaces and sacrifice salary in order to defend their country.\n  All we are saying is, for all of that, we want you to stay in the \nGuard and continue to serve your country, so we are going to be a \nlittle more fair regarding your access to health insurance. That would \nbe one less problem for them. This amendment does that permanently, and \nit deserves to be passed overwhelmingly.\n  We are not going to ask for a rollcall vote because we have had three \nof them. We think the Senate is on record adequately regarding this \nlegislation. We will be back. This only authorizes it in the budget. We \nare going to come back with Defense Appropriations to make sure it is \nalso a part of the law as we consider the important aspects of public \npolicy relating to defense in the future.\n  Again, let me end where I started. Senator Graham deserves great \ncredit for the effort he made to bring us to this point. I am pleased \nthat, on a bipartisan basis, we can pass this with an exclamation point \nthis afternoon. This deserves to be law. This year is the year to do \nit.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator \nfrom Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, is there 5 minutes available to speak \nfor the amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sponsor controls 1 additional minute. The \nminority manager of the bill controls 20 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. How much time does the Senator need?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Five minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, does Senator Graham wish to retain a \nminute of his time?\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Yes. I will try to yield part of it \nback.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Louisiana off of \nour time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thank those managing the bill, and I \nthank the Senator from South Carolina for bringing this amendment to \nthe floor. I would like to cosponsor this amendment because it helps \nour veterans and Guard and Reserve in two very important ways. The \nSenator's portion of this helps to extend the TRICARE piece and extends \nalso in this amendment the GI benefits for the Guard and Reserve.\n  As I have said many times, the Guard and Reserve that is protecting \nus today, that is serving as the core in many instances of our Armed \nForces, is not the Guard and Reserve of our fathers' or grandfathers' \ngenerations. They are citizen soldiers. They are professional soldiers. \nBecause of policy changes we put into place, the Guard and Reserve now \nare picking up about 40 percent of the battlefield burdens, and they \ndeserve a greater portion of the overall budget to support them.\n  Do our active troops deserve support? Absolutely. But our Guard and \nReserve, because they are picking up an ever-increasing responsibility \nregarding this war against terrorism, the war in Afghanistan and the \nwar in Iraq, and even right here on the homefront, deserve more help \nand support.\n  I am proud to be a cosponsor of this amendment. I believe it will \npass with great support on both sides.\n  I wanted to take a minute to also talk about something I hope we can \nfind a way in this debate to fix. I want to see if we can find a way to \nfix the survivor benefit plan, which was enacted in 1972. This survivor \nbenefit plan was a pension benefit for military spouses, after the \nretirees passed away. We said if the retired veterans wanted to \nbasically pay into a certain account, when the retiree died, their \nwives would receive 55 percent of the veterans retirement pay.\n  We created this fund. However, after it was established, budget \npolicies were put into place that basically cut out that benefit. So we \nnow have the unbelievable and untenable situation where spouses--most \nof them women; I would say 85 to 90 percent are female--who, by the \nrequest of our military, move themselves and their families every 2 \nyears, which makes it extremely difficult for anyone to develop any \nconsistency in a career outside the home, even if they were able and \nwilling. Moving every 2 years doesn't give them the opportunity to \nexpand their earning capacity. That was a sacrifice many spouses and \ntheir families made to support the men in this case--in most cases--\nserving in our military and to support the country.\n  Yet for all that great commitment and service and dedication, we tell \nthem, thank you very much, but we are going to cut your benefits from \n55 percent of what you and your spouse put\n\n[[Page S2498]]\n\nin, in some instances, down to 32 percent. It is not fair.\n  There are Senators on the floor--I see the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee--who say we cannot afford to cut back the tax cut to provide \nfor this. They say the tax cut is too important and we cannot even \nmodify it or change it or postpone it or adjust it even in the \nslightest amount to pay for that.\n  I disagree. I think we can find a way to adjust the tax cut to pay \nfor the widows who moved every 2 years, paid their own money into the \nfund, and now they get shortchanged. When we talk about supporting our \nmilitary families, let's remember the soldier on the battlefield, and \nlet's also remember the soldiers who are at home, both the spouses and \nchildren who bear a tremendous burden, who do it willingly and with \ngreat patriotism. Let's not ask them to sacrifice when others in this \ncountry are not willing to make that same sacrifice.\n  I will be offering this amendment later, supporting the amendment \nthat is on the floor. Hopefully, we can convince some of the leadership \nto make adjustments in their tax cut plans to do some things we need to \ndo for our men and women in uniform and their families.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat Senators Lincoln, Dayton, Murray, Murkowski, and Mikulski be added \nas cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, as Senator Daschle has \ndescribed, this will be offset. This will be budget-friendly, and it \nwill be a huge deal to military Reserve and Guard families who are \nsacrificing much for their country. It will help build a better support \nnetwork. If you are called to active duty for the Guard and Reserve, \nthere is no daycare center on base because there is no base in which to \ngo. There is no counseling service because you are sometimes in a rural \ncommunity far away from military bases.\n  This continuity of health care would help dramatically. I urge its \nadoption.\n  I thank Senator Nickles for making this possible. I look forward to \nwriting good legislation to help the Guard and Reserve families.\n  I ask unanimous consent that all time be yielded back on this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from South Carolina.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I compliment my colleague from South \nCarolina and the Senator from Kentucky, Mr. Bunning, as well as Senator \nDaschle and Senator Conrad. We have no objection to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2731) was agreed to.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, again, I compliment our colleagues. I \nurge other colleagues, if they have ideas on amendments, to share them \nwith us and maybe we can work some of them out and eliminate the need \nfor rollcall votes. Rollcall votes take a lot of time and they also \ndon't count on the time for the budget resolution.\n  I have a unanimous consent agreement on two additional amendments. We \nhave unanimous consent on an amendment by Senator Byrd, dealing with \nstriking the reconciliation instruction, dealing with taxes on the \nresolution. That is limited to 1 hour. That will begin in a moment.\n  Following that, I ask unanimous consent that an amendment to be \noffered by Senators Warner and Stevens pertaining to the Department of \nDefense be limited to 1 hour; an amendment by Senator Feingold dealing \nwith pay-go also be limited to 1 hour, with no second-degree amendments \nin order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding, listening to my \nfriend from Oklahoma, the votes will be stacked; is that right?\n  Mr. NICKLES. That is my intention. I think we can do all these \namendments and probably start the votes shortly before 6. These are \nthree important issues, so Members should be advised--I know Members on \nthe Finance Committee wish to speak on a couple of these issues--to be \nprepared to debate, and Members should expect three rollcall votes \nshortly before 6 o'clock.\n  Mr. REID. Will my friend also agree to have 1 minute on each side \nprior to each vote?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I have no objection to that request. I modify my request \nso that the first vote be on Senator Byrd's amendment and then the \nfollowing two votes, and the managers be allowed to have 1 minute each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request as modified? \nWithout objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, now we will begin consideration of an \namendment Senator Byrd will lay down momentarily to strike the \nreconciliation provision.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator withhold?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold his request for a \nquorum call?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Yes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, Senator Byrd is now in the Chamber. While \nhe is going to his desk to present his amendment, I wish to take this \nmoment to urge our colleagues to get their amendments to us so we can \nreview them, so we can eliminate duplication, so we can schedule them \nefficiently.\n  If Senators have an amendment they kind of like but really would not \nneed to offer, please withhold. We already have 58 amendments noticed. \nThat is 19 hours of voting. It is going to take discipline if we want \nto conclude the business on the budget resolution by Friday, which is \nour common goal. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nWest Virginia is recognized to offer an amendment. The Senator from \nWest Virginia.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2735\n\n     (Purpose: To provide for consideration of tax cuts outside of \n                            reconciliation)\n\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair. I call up my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2735.\n       Strike Section 201(a) of the committee-reported resolution, \n     on page 24 line 21 through page 25 line 3.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, for many years, I have been growing \nincreasingly concerned about the Senate as a forum for debate. Senators \nat every turn seem bent upon undermining this institution and the \nvision of our constitutional framers embodied in this upper body of the \nCongress.\n  The Senate is the only forum in our Government where the perfection \nof laws may be unhurried and where controversial decisions may be \nhammered out on the anvil of lengthy debate. It may be slow; it may be \nunwieldy; it may be frustrating to some; but it is the best means to \nachieving compromise, to ensuring an informed citizenry, to protecting \nthe rights of the minority. To shut out the minority by limiting the \nright to debate is to needlessly and detrimentally infuse partisanship \ninto the legislative process. That is exactly what we are seeing in \nthis budget resolution.\n  Included in the Budget chairman's resolution are reconciliation \ninstructions to the Finance Committee to report $81 billion in tax cuts \nto extend the child credit, marriage penalty, and 10-percent bracket \nexpansion that are scheduled to expire this year. If misused, there is \nno procedural mechanism in the Senate more contemptuous of debate than \nthe budget reconciliation process, and it is being misused. It is a \nprocess that has morphed into an annual exercise where the majority \nparty takes advantage of the limitations on amendment and debate \nallowed by the\n\n[[Page S2499]]\n\nBudget Act to shield controversial legislation from public discussion.\n  This budget resolution would use reconciliation to circumvent a \ndebate in the Senate about the wisdom of allowing additional tax cuts \nto deepen the deficit.\n  I helped to craft the Budget Act in 1974, and I can tell Senators we \nnever in that day contemplated reconciliation would be used to shield \nfrom debate legislation that spends the Social Security surplus and \nincreases deficits. We, in that day, never one time envisioned these \nabuses of the process.\n  Senators regularly express their desire for less partisanship, \nlonging for the days--the days almost beyond recall--when the Senate \naccomplished its business without the political acrimony that has \nmarked recent debates.\n  One reason the Senate avoided such partisanship is because the \nleaders of the Senate respected the rights of the minority and allowed \nthe Senate to work its will through open and vigorous debate.\n  In 1981, Republican leader Howard Baker of Tennessee had the \nopportunity to use reconciliation to pass President Reagan's tax-cut \npackage. Did he use it to do so? No. He chose instead to allow the tax \ncut to be brought before the Senate as a freestanding bill and fully \ndebated. He said at the time, and I quote Howard Baker:\n\n       Aside from its salutary impact on the budget, \n     reconciliation also has implications for the Senate as an \n     institution . . .\n       I believe that including such extraneous provisions in a \n     reconciliation bill would be harmful to the character of the \n     Senate. It would cause such material to be considered under \n     time and germaneness provisions that impede the full exercise \n     of minority rights.\n\n  Now, that was an extraordinary statement of extraordinary vision by \nan extraordinary Senator, Howard Baker of Tennessee. Let me read it \nagain, and I quote him:\n\n       Aside from its salutary impact on the budget, \n     reconciliation also has implications for the Senate as an \n     institution . . . I believe that including such extraneous \n     provisions in a reconciliation bill would be harmful to the \n     character of the Senate. It would cause such material to be \n     considered under time and germaneness provisions that impede \n     the full exercise of minority rights.\n\n  That was a statement by a statesman. For almost 20 years, the Senate \nexercised restraint with regard to the reconciliation process, and \nuntil 1995 the reconciliation process served as a helpful mechanism for \ndeficit reduction. Since then, the process has been twisted and \ncontorted by those who find its limitations on debate and amendment too \nenticing to resist, using it to advance a partisan agenda.\n  The country is the worse for that legislative opportunism. Would that \nHoward Baker could again speak from these desks.\n  Today, the White House is projecting deficits at an alarming $521 \nbillion for the fiscal year 2004. To pay for its tax cuts, the Bush \nadministration is spending every dime of the Social Security surplus, \nmoney that the President and both parties pledged to set aside to save \nour retirement and disability system. According to the White House's \nown numbers, the gross debt just passed the $7 trillion mark on its way \nto $11 trillion in 2009, and there is no credible plan from this \nadministration or this Congress to do anything about it.\n  In response to mounting budget deficit projections, President Ronald \nReagan signed into law 12 bills to increase taxes, including \nlegislation to repeal part of his 1981 tax cut. Similarly, in response \nto alarming deficit projections in 1990, President Bush's father made \nthe courageous decision to break his no new taxes pledge.\n  State legislatures and Governors have been making similar decisions \nover the past 3 years in Alaska, Alabama, Connecticut, Idaho, Nebraska, \nNevada, and Ohio. It is what is being debated right now in Richmond, \nVA.\n  Senator Warner recently and courageously declared: Politics be \ndamned. Let's consider what is best for the men and women and their \nfamilies and children.\n  The debate about budget deficits is taking place all across this \ncountry. Ironically, the one place where debate is discouraged on this \nmatter is right here in this so-called greatest deliberative body in \nthe world today. The tax cut reconciliation instructions in this budget \nresolution would stifle a debate when it is most needed.\n  After 3 years of tax cuts and promises of job growth, the country has \nnot reaped the benefits of those promises. We can tout higher economic \ngrowth rates. We can tout higher productivity. But none of these \nstatistics mean anything to an unemployed worker. So far there seems to \nbe no robust connection between these particular tax cuts and job \ncreation.\n  Since January 2001, 2.2 million jobs have been lost. The \nmanufacturing sector has endured 43 straight months of job loss. \nDiscouraged workers are dropping out of the labor pool at a rate of \n100,000 per week. One million jobs have been lost overseas. Countless \nworkers, white-collar workers and blue-collar workers, are worried that \ntheir own jobs may be next.\n\n  The only thing we know for sure at this point is that tax cuts over \nthe past 3 years have contributed to an explosion in debt. Just look at \npage 189 in the historical tables of the President's budget. After \ndropping to a low of $5.6 trillion in the fiscal year 2000, the gross \nFederal debt has increased to $5.8 trillion in the fiscal year 2001 to \n$6.2 trillion in the fiscal year 2002 to $6.8 trillion in the fiscal \nyear 2003, and it will continue to increase to an estimated $10.6 \ntrillion in the fiscal year 2009. These figures are beyond all \ncomprehension.\n  It is not just election year rhetoric. The IMF, the GAO, and the \nFederal Reserve are all in agreement that deficits do matter, and they \nare threatening to derail the economy of the United States.\n  That is not all. The deficits also are threatening our ability to \nsave Social Security. I understand why some would prefer not to engage \nin a lengthy debate about the explosion in the gross debt. The American \npublic already is having trouble understanding why the Congress should \nenact the $1.2 trillion in new tax cuts included in the President's \nbudget before we have even figured out how we are going to pay for the \ncost of the ongoing operations in Iraq.\n  The budget resolution includes $30 billion in funds for ongoing \noperations in Iraq. And that figure is only in here because of the \nthoughtfulness of the distinguished chairman, only because of his \nthoughtfulness and foresight in putting the figures in here. The \nadministration downtown didn't put a penny in, not one thin dime.\n\n  But that $30 billion is even less than what was included in the House \nbudget, $20 billion less than what the administration intends to ask \nfrom the Congress, and only enough to finance the first 6 months of the \n5-year span in the budget resolution.\n  The deficits embraced by this budget resolution will prevent the \nCongress from allocating any money to address the threat to the Social \nSecurity system, even though the Social Security actuaries estimate $1 \ntrillion will be needed to finance the transition costs under the \noptions proposed by the President's Social Security Commission.\n  Reconciliation protects additional tax cuts from public discussion \nabout the size of the financial burden that will be passed on to our \nchildren and our grandchildren, and it leaves hanging questions about \ndeficit and debt and balanced budgets that are clearly on the minds of \nthe American people.\n  We have hard choices to make that may bring to bear enormous change \nin our Nation. We should not do so silently. This is no time to sweep \nproblems under the rug. At the very least, we have a duty to the future \nto discuss and debate so that the public, the people out there looking \nat us through those electronic eyes behind that Presiding Officer's \nchair will know our reasoning and hold us responsible, hold us \naccountable. We should lay down a record so that, if in the end our \nchoices are right, they may have in our example a good and steady guide \nand they may then say, ``Well done, thou good and faithful servant. . . \n.'' and so on. But, also so if destiny so transpires that our choices \nwere wrong, others will not repeat our mistakes.\n  If we have learned nothing else from the events of the past year, we \ncertainly should have learned the absolute necessity of debate in our \ndemocratic Republic. We should have learned the folly of failing to ask \nquestions, of failing to probe and to delve, failing to do our duty as \nthe elected representatives of the people of this great Republic. I\n\n[[Page S2500]]\n\nwould think by now we should have learned the dire consequences of our \nfailure to insist on debate. The Senate must not shirk its \nresponsibility to engage in debate about these issues.\n  With the American public, according to recent polls, in such stark \ndisagreement with the current course of our Nation's economic and \nbudget policies, it is time for the Senate at long last to finally \nengage in an honest debate about the fiscal course laid out by this \nadministration.\n  In recent weeks the chairman of the Budget Committee has expressed \nhis desire to address the expiring child credit, the marriage penalty, \nand the 10-percent bracket tax cuts through the regular legislative \nprocess. The chairman of the Finance Committee has indicated his belief \nthat including those tax cuts in the reconciliation bill would create a \nneedlessly partisan debate.\n  The Senate needs time to explore these views. While these \nreconciliation instructions are viewed by some as only a backup plan if \nboth the House and Senate pass a budget resolution with tax \nreconciliation instructions, the decision about whether to use \nreconciliation may be taken out of our hands. The House can force us to \ntake up a reconciliation bill in the Senate containing tax cuts.\n  The American public deserves the opportunity to better understand how \nthese tax cuts will affect our mounting budget deficits, and to probe \nwhether these tax cuts should be offset. We should allow the Senate to \nhave its debate, not stifle it.\n  That is the issue on which we will vote. A vote to strike the \nreconciliation instructions is a vote to allow the Senate to engage in \nan informed debate. That is what I want. I want an informed debate. \nThat is why I am suggesting we strike these instructions, so we may \nengage in an informed debate about how to prevent the further deepening \nof the deficit, and a further worsening of the bitter atmosphere that \nhas, regrettably, engulfed this body.\n  I urge Senators to vote to strike the tax cut reconciliation \ninstructions.\n  I ask unanimous consent to add Senators Conrad and Baucus as \ncosponsors of my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. I ask unanimous consent to reserve the remainder of my \ntime. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sponsor of the amendment controls an \nadditional 8 minutes. The majority bill manager controls 30 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I compliment my friend and colleague from \nWest Virginia. He is my friend. He is a valued member of the Budget \nCommittee. He has been on the committee for a couple of years, and I \nvery much enjoyed his participation with us on the Budget Committee.\n  As a matter of fact, one of my fondest moments, I will tell my friend \nfrom West Virginia, in my tenure as Budget chairman, occurred last \nyear. We were in the process of marking up the budget. My first \ngrandson was born. That happens to be day after tomorrow I celebrate \nhis birth. You acknowledged it with a very nice poem, and I want to \nthank you for that.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. You know, my wife and I are the proud possessors of two \ngreat-grandchildren, just within the last month. The distinguished \nchairman's grandson, and Erma's and my great-grandchildren, each of \nthem owes, as of this past Monday, $24,253.36 on the national debt of \nthe United States. My amendment is for the purpose of keeping down this \ndebt and not increasing the deficit.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I appreciate my colleague's comment. I appreciate the \nearnestness with which he says it and makes his case very forcefully, \nbut I am going to urge the opposite side.\n  Let me say, I don't totally disagree with my friend and colleague \nfrom West Virginia. I regret it appears we probably need reconciliation \nat times to get things done in the Senate. My colleague from West \nVirginia opined about the great days years past when Howard Baker was \nmajority leader. I remember that very well. I remember passing great \ntax bills. We actually passed a tax bill in 1981, and in 1986--by 1988 \nthe maximum tax bracket went from 70 percent to 28 percent. The Senator \nfrom West Virginia is right, it wasn't done under reconciliation.\n  But I also say the climate was much better in the Senate. There was a \nlot more cooperation in the Senate. The Senate was more civil and I \nwish the Senate would return to those days. I hope we don't need \nreconciliation to pass the bills we are advocating or encouraging the \nFinance Committee to do. I think it should be able to be done without \nreconciliation, if the Senate would work the way it should work.\n  The Senator from West Virginia knows, though, things have changed. \nUnfortunately things have changed a lot in the Senate. We used to not \nhave filibusters on judges, never had them in the history of the \nSenate. Now we have six individuals we can't confirm because they \nhappen to be nominated to an appellate court.\n  We have a situation today where we can't even get bills, in some \ncases that have been approved by the entire Senate unanimously--we \ncan't even get conferees appointed. Senator Enzi from Wyoming sponsored \na bill that has strong bipartisan support. The Workforce Reinvestment \nAct passed the Senate unanimously, and we can't get conferees \nappointed.\n  I am troubled by how difficult it is or how partisan it is to do a \nlot of work in the Senate.\n  Last year, yes, we used reconciliation to pass a tax bill and the tax \nbill was a jobs growth bill. To help the economy we did it, and frankly \nit worked. If we hadn't used reconciliation last year, it wouldn't have \npassed. The only reason I was advocating, reluctantly, that we use the \nreconciliation process to pass it was because I thought it was the only \nway we could pass it. In days of old, you could pass legislation in the \nSenate with a majority vote, but a lot of times people think we need to \nhave 60 votes to pass everything. I think that is a serious mistake. \nThe tax bill we did pass last year did cut taxes on dividends.\n  We used to tax corporate dividends higher than any other country in \nthe world. We slashed that tax by half--in some cases more than half--\nand it worked. We cut the capital gains rate from 20 percent to 15 \npercent, and it worked. We set the maximum rate for individuals as the \nsame rate for corporations--35 percent--and it has worked. The economy \nreally did start to move. The reconciliation process and expedited \nprocedure helped us to do things that, frankly, in the past we couldn't \nhave done under normal procedures. The only way to make sure there is \nnot a tax increase on my daughter and, frankly, on my grandson is to \nmake sure we have reconciliation.\n  I appreciate Senator Byrd saying the amount of debt per child born \ntoday is very significant. I want to reduce that. We have a budget that \nis the most significant deficit reduction package before this Senate in \nyears--maybe decades, maybe ever. We take a $477 billion deficit and \nreduce it in half in a couple or three years. That is not easily done. \nI don't think we should raise taxes on American families by not having \nthis reconciliation process. I am afraid that is what will happen.\n  Some people say you want to give additional tax cuts. The truth is, \nwe want to keep the tax cuts that are now in law. We don't want to have \ntax increases on American families. If we don't have this \nreconciliation process, that may well happen. It may be that some \nMembers, for partisan reasons or whatever, would say: I just do not \nwant that to happen. I know President Bush really wants it, and, \ntherefore, they might work hard to see that it doesn't happen. What \nhappens if that is the case? If the tax bill, which is current law, is \nnot extended, there will be a tax increase on American families.\n  To give you an example, a couple that has taxable income of $58,100--\nthat is not a particularly wealthy family; I think most of us would say \nthat is a middle-income family--this year, under present law, will pay \n$6,000. If we don't keep present law, their taxes will increase to \n$7,600; that is for a family of four.\n  I will outline it. With the provisions that we are assuming in \nreconciliation, the Finance Committee can reconcile anything. If we \ngive them $80 billion and say, reconcile the tax reduction, we are \nassuming--presuming maybe--they would extend present law. We are\n\n[[Page S2501]]\n\nnot trying to cut taxes further than they are in the year 2000. We are \njust trying to keep the present tax law from increasing. If we don't do \nit, they will find with the tax credit we have now that the $1,000 a \nchild goes to $700. That is a $300 tax increase on that family. If they \nhave two kids, that is $600. If they have four kids, that is $1,200.\n  Last year we also did something that a lot of people do not \nunderstand but it is very significant in the Tax Code. We have the most \nsignificant reduction in the marriage penalty--the imposition of taxes \non people and penalizing them because of the fact they are married. It \nis a higher income tax on couples as compared to individuals. We have \nthe most significant reduction of that tax in history. We basically \nsaid for at least the couple they should pay the 15-percent bracket. \nBasically they should have to double the amount of income that an \nindividual has on the 15-percent bracket. It should be doubled for \ncouples. Individuals who have taxable income pay at the 15-percent \nbracket--taxable income up to $29,000. We say that should be $58,100 \nfor a couple.\n\n  If we don't extend present law, they will have a tax increase of \n$900. They will be paying 25 percent, not on income above $58,100. They \nwill be paying 25 percent above any income above $42,000. That is a \n$900 tax increase, if we don't extend present law for a married couple.\n  My father-in-law and mother-in-law are both retired. Their income is \nin this category. I don't want them to have a $900 tax increase. I \ndon't want my son and my son-in-law and my daughter to have a $900 \nincrease. I want them to be able to get a $1,000 tax credit. It costs a \nlot of money nowadays to raise children and to educate children.\n  We also have an expansion of the 10-percent bracket as well. More \npeople pay more who have a greater amount of income. They pay a 10-\npercent tax instead of 15 percent. That tax rate used to be 15 percent \nand was reduced to 10 percent, and we expanded the amount of income \ncovered under that.\n  To make sure people understand, we are trying to extend present law \nto make sure that a couple with a taxable income of $58,100 will not \nhave a $1,600 tax increase if they have two kids. If they have four \nkids, it would be a $2,200 tax increase. I didn't want that to happen \nto American families.\n  One way of making sure it doesn't happen is to have reconciliation \nprotection so we can pass a bill. If we get bogged down politically and \nSenator Grassley and Senator Baucus can't get it worked out, if there \nare endless amendments and people will say we are going to keep \namending this thing forever, you will never get an agreement to finish \nit. It is nice to have at least in the arsenal to get things done a \nreconciliation process where it can guarantee that we don't increase \ntaxes on American families. That is why this reconciliation provision \nis in there. It is not a lot of money.\n  We are assuming, according to the Congressional Budget Office, almost \n$12 trillion of revenues to be generated to the Federal Government \nunder present law over the next 5 years--$12 trillion. I will tell my \ncolleague from West Virginia that we are only reconciling $81 billion \nout of $12 trillion.\n  Again, I don't consider that new taxes. That is extending present law \nfor American families--for low-income and middle-income American \nfamilies primarily. They will be the big beneficiaries of this.\n  I have the greatest respect for my colleague and friend from West \nVirginia. But I urge our colleagues to vote no on the amendment to \nstrike reconciliation because this is our resource if people are \nobstructing passing bills. It seems to be more prevalent all the time \nin the Senate today. Let us maintain some protection for the American \ntaxpayer by using reconciliation, if we have to. We can make sure these \ntax increases of $1,600 or $2,200 for a family of four do not happen. \nLet us not saddle American couples with a $900 tax increase. Let us \nmake sure we protect taxpayers and American families. I am afraid, \nunfortunately, we need reconciliation as an option to make sure they \naren't faced with a big tax increase.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, may I get 3 minutes?\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield 3 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, let me say we don't need the \nreconciliation process to extend the middle-class tax cut the chairman \nhas referenced. I support and I will work to get votes to extend the \n$1,000 childcare credit, to extend the marriage penalty relief, and to \nextend the 10-percent bracket. I am absolutely confident that we can \nget the votes to do that outside of reconciliation.\n  What is wrong here is to use reconciliation for tax cuts. \nReconciliation, which is a fast-track process in the Senate that limits \nour right to debate, that limits our right to amend, is used for \nsomething other than deficit reduction. The only reason Senators agreed \nto give up their basic rights was because we were in a crisis that \nrequired deficit reduction. This is adding to the deficit--not reducing \nit. The chairman said this budget before us has a record amount of \ndeficit reduction. This budget before us has a record amount of debt \nincrease. This budget before us will increase the debt of the United \nStates by $2.86 trillion over the next 5 years.\n  The former Budget Committee chairman, Senator Domenici, said this \nabout reconciliation:\n\n       Frankly, as chairman of the Budget Committee, I am aware of \n     how beneficial reconciliation can be to deficit reduction. \n     But I am also totally aware of what can happen when we choose \n     to use this kind of process to basically get around the Rules \n     of the Senate as to limiting debate. Clearly, unlimited \n     debate is the prerogative of the Senate. That is greatly \n     modified under this process. I have grown to understand that \n     this institution, while it has a lot of shortcomings, has \n     some qualities that are rather exceptional. One of those is \n     the fact that it is an extremely free institution, that we \n     are free to offer amendments, that we are free to take as \n     much time as this U.S. Senate will let us to debate and have \n     those issues thoroughly understood both here and across the \n     country.\n\n  Finally, the simple fact is, the reconciliation instruction in this \nbudget resolution doesn't assure that those tax cuts--the middle-class \ntax cuts--will be the ones that are, in fact, brought back to us by the \nFinance Committee. We all know the budget resolution does not make the \nspecific decisions of how the revenue is raised by the Finance \nCommittee.\n\n  The chairman of the committee has said over and over in the Senate, \nwe do not control the specifics of what the Finance Committee does. All \nthis reconciliation instruction does is give $80 billion to the Finance \nCommittee. They can use it for any tax-cutting purpose.\n  Again, we can have an extension of the middle-class tax cuts, $1,000 \nchild credit, and 10-percent bracket, the marriage penalty relief \nwithout the blunderbuss of reconciliation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I will be brief with a couple of \ncomments.\n  According to the Department of the Treasury, if Senator Conrad is \ncorrect, we give the Finance Committee an instruction and they can do \nwhatever they want, but these three provisions I mention are the only \nones that expire at the end of this year that have a lot of popular \nsupport because they affect millions of people.\n  The Treasury Department says if these are not extended, 94 million \ntaxpayers would receive an average tax increase of $538 if we do not \nextend these three. Seventy million women would see their taxes \nincrease on average $662. Forty-six million married couples, including \nmy son-in-law and daughter, including my father-in-law and mother-in-\nlaw, 46 million married couples would pay on average an additional $906 \nin taxes. Thirty-eight million families with children would incur an \naverage tax increase of $902. Eight million single women with children \nwill see their taxes increase on average by $368. Eleven million \nelderly taxpayers would pay on average an additional $383. I could go \non.\n  This is important to protect these families, these citizens, these \nwomen, these children from a tax increase. I am afraid that \nreconciliation is the only tool we can have to almost assure them they \nwill not be straddled with a big tax increase for next year.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia controls an \nadditional 5 minutes.\n\n[[Page S2502]]\n\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  The distinguished chairman has alluded to the sometimes ill will that \nexists increasingly within our own premises. That ill will is often \nengendered by the meddling of the White House. The White House should \nnot meddle in the business of the Congress. Congress should pass bills \nand the President can decide whether to sign or to veto them.\n  Last year, the President stepped in late in the debate on the Omnibus \nappropriations bill and forced the conferees to drop protection for \nworkers to earn overtime. He forced us to change the media ownership \nrules in order to protect large corporate interests. We should not \nallow the President to force the Congress to consider legislation \nthrough reconciliation.\n  Moreover, I say to my friend from Oklahoma, this amendment is not \nabout tax cuts. It is about paying for tax cuts. This budget resolution \nassumes that our gross debt will grow to $10.6 trillion by 2009. This \nresolution does nothing to address the staggering debt. In fact, it \nassumes $144 billion of additional tax cuts with $81 billion of tax \ncuts cloaked within the protection of reconciliation. We should insist \non a full debate on whether these tax cuts should be paid for.\n  We do not need reconciliation to get things done. In 1981, we passed \nPresident Reagan's tax cuts without reconciliation. Reconciliation was \ndesigned to pass difficult legislation that would help to reduce the \ndeficit. It was not designed to pass tax cuts. We are facing huge \ndeficits. We should have an opportunity to actually debate whether \nadditional tax cuts should be paid for.\n  May I say to my chairman, I respect him greatly. I am sorry he has \nvoluntarily elected to leave the Senate and not chair the committee. I \nhave tremendous admiration for him. I have always enjoyed his \nfriendship and my associations with him, and I shall long miss him.\n  I hope, on the note on which we have been playing, Senators will \nsupport my amendment.\n  Does my chairman wish any further time?\n  Mr. CONRAD. How much time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia controls 1\\1/2\\ \nminutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield that time to my chairman.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator.\n  I yield 5\\1/2\\ minutes off the resolution and the minute and a half \nthat we have in addition for a total of 7 minutes to the Senator from \nMontana, the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, all Members ought to think and reflect \nupon this amendment and how important this amendment is. First of all, \nlet me explain what this amendment does and what it does not do.\n  What does it not do? It does not prevent any of the middle-income tax \ncuts we all want to extend. It does not do that. It does not prevent \nthose tax cuts. It does not prevent Congress from enacting an extension \nof those tax cuts that we all want to extend. This amendment has no \neffect on that.\n  What does it do? It says we should not use the regular Senate rules \nin deciding whether to extend and how to extend the middle-income tax \ncuts; that is, the child tax credit, the marriage penalty, and the 10-\npercent bracket. It says no, create a special rule. Do not use the \nregular order, the regular standing rules of the Senate in determining \nhow and in what way we extend those middle-income tax credits. This \namendment does say do not do that. And Congress will extend those \nmiddle-income tax cuts. That is not the issue. We are going to do that.\n  The issue is twofold. One is, should we pay for them or not? That is \nthe issue. And there are lots of ways we could pay for it, lots of ways \nthat are virtually painless. What are those virtually painless ways? \nClosing a lot of tax loopholes. There are countless tax loopholes that \nwe can pass very quickly, shelters that are ripping off American \ntaxpayers, post-Enron provisions. There are a host of them. We talk \nabout SILOs, for example. We know we are about to find in the Finance \nCommittee other shelters being used that are not widely known.\n  That is why we are saying this is a two-for. We are saying to extend \nthe middle-income tax credits, tax provisions, child tax cut, and the \n10-percent bracket, and at the same time we are going to clamp down on \nsome tax loopholes. I am not being facetious or joking about this. This \nis real. There are immense loopholes we can and should close down. I \nknow the Presiding Officer agrees, as most Members would agree. This is \na two-for.\n  We are saying, let's get that two-for, get both of those passed. And \nwe have to pass the amendment of the Senator from West Virginia to do \nthat; otherwise, we are saying change the Senate rules, extend these \ntax cuts but do not pay for them, do not enact those shelters.\n  I also add, we have a moral obligation.\n  We have a moral obligation, I believe, as Senators, as \nrepresentatives of our people, to leave this place in as good a shape \nor better shape than we found it. That pertains to the environment. \nThat pertains to the budgets. That pertains to all we do. We are \nentrusted with such responsibility as U.S. Senators.\n  And, my Lord, it seems to me, right off the top, at the very least, \nwe could cut back on the irresponsible, large deficits and debts we are \ngoing to be leaving our children and our grandchildren. That is a moral \nobligation you have, I have, and each Member of this body has.\n  By adopting the amendment of the Senator from West Virginia, we can \nmake good on that moral responsibility, that moral obligation, by \nsaying, sure, we are going to extend the tax cuts, as well we should, \nbut we are going to do it in a responsible way; we are not going to add \nto the budget deficit; we are not going to add to the debt. It is the \nonly right thing to do. I urge my colleagues, therefore, to pay very \nclose attention to the Senator's amendment and to adopt it.\n  I might add, there are other issues. I do not think these have been \nthought through very much. Let me just explain.\n  The budget resolution instructs the Finance Committee to decrease \nrevenues by $80.6 billion. This is intended to cover the extension, as \nI mentioned, of expiring middle-class tax cuts--the 10-percent bracket, \nthe marriage penalty, and the child tax credit. The instruction for \nthis tax bill does not, however, include any instructions to increase \noutlays.\n  Why is that important? It is very important. It is an instruction for \ntax cuts. Why am I saying we need to also increase outlays? It is not \ncalled for in the budget reconciliation provision. I say so because \nthese specific tax cuts also require outlays. That is because there is \na refundable part of these tax cuts. Let me explain it.\n  The child tax credit provides a $1,000 per child tax credit for low- \nand middle-income families. There are some working, low-income families \nthat do not have income tax liability that this credit can be used to \noffset. Even so, they are out there working every day paying a good \nchunk of their paycheck in payroll taxes. For these families whose \nincome does not qualify, we provide, in the law today, as you know, a \nrefundable child tax credit. They do not have the income liability to \noffset, so they get a refund from the Treasury, and this scores for \nbudget purposes as an outlay.\n  These reconciliation instructions tell us to extend the child tax \ncredit. But we know that if we extended the child tax credit for all \nthe families that currently receive it, it would take about $20 billion \nin outlays. But the reconciliation instruction fails to include this. \nIt does not even mention it. In fact, by definition, therefore, we \ncannot increase outlays.\n  So what does this mean? The best I can figure it, it means we should \nextend the tax cuts for all families--except for the working poor. If \nmiddle-income families deserve to get the $1,000 child tax credit next \nyear, then why not low-income families?\n  We have heard many times this week: Families should not see their \ntaxes increase next year. We should extend the current tax relief. So \nwhy does this budget leave the working poor families behind?\n  There are about 26 million families that receive the child tax \ncredit. About 8 million of these families receive some refundable \ncredit. That is almost one-quarter of all child tax credit recipients, \nfamilies making between $10,500\n\n[[Page S2503]]\n\nand $26,000. Three-quarters of families deserve an extension of the \nfull child credit but not the remaining one-quarter? This does not make \nsense. Give me a break.\n\n  Who are the families that will be left behind? Let's think about that \na second. A single mother of one, making $17,000 a year is left behind. \nA couple, both working full time at minimum wage is left behind. What \nother type of family is going to be left behind? Military families. \nThere are a couple reasons for this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional \nminutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I give the Senator 2 minutes off the \nresolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Why are military families left behind under this \nreconciliation instruction?\n  First, there are many military families that have incomes between \n$10,000 and $26,000 a year. Roughly, 200,000 military personnel fall \nwithin this income range. They all get the refundable child tax credit. \nBut under the reconciliation provisions, which the Senator from West \nVirginia wishes to delete, they would be left behind. They do not get \nany help.\n  Second, there are many military personnel with higher incomes who \nreceive the refundable child tax credit. But why do the higher income \npeople receive the refundable child tax credit? That is because they \nhave been called to serve in combat zones. Why is that relevant? Well, \nthe income military personnel receive when they are in a combat zone \ndoes not count for income tax purposes. That means it also does not \ncount for purposes of determining the child tax credit. How many are \nthose? At least 40,000. So even though these families make more than \nthe $26,000, they are receiving the refundable child tax credit because \nthey are in a combat zone.\n  So roughly a quarter of a million military families are being cut out \nby the Budget Committee's reconciliation instructions. Families that \nreceive the refundable credit simply because they are serving in a \ncombat zone or simply because they are serving in the military--all \nthese families will be left behind.\n  We all agree, extending the child tax credit is critical. So why are \nso many families being excluded?\n  This reconciliation instruction will not work the way it should. It \nis not right to cut so many low-income people off and out of the child \ntax credit. That is wrong. So let's work together. Let's use the \nregular order and the Senate rules so we can fix some of these \ndiscrepancies that exist in the current budget resolution.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment of the Senator from \nWest Virginia. It is the right thing to do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself up to 15 minutes of our \n17 minutes for remarks I will have on the subject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, first of all, I think, based upon my \nclose working relationship with the Senator from Montana and our work \non guiding the Finance Committee, from what he said, I have just one \ndisagreement with his position. I think the difference between what he \nsaid and the position I am taking is that I, myself, as leader of the \ncommittee, want to do things through regular order. I think we can do \nthings through regular order.\n  But just in case we cannot, since this tax policy is so important to \nworking men and women--not increasing their taxes next year is so \nimportant--I want the insurance policy a reconciliation package gives \nus, just in case there is something unpredictable out there.\n  Now, I do not think I would have said that same thing in 2001, I \nwould not have said that same thing in 2003, where I believed we needed \nto absolutely pass something that was going to be so controversial that \nit would not pass maybe except by reconciliation.\n  In this particular case, I believe we are going to have the spirit, \nthe bipartisanship to get this stuff done without going through \nreconciliation. So I think that is the only place I disagree with my \ncolleague. In other words, I am speaking for the budget resolution as \nit came out of the Budget Committee.\n  But what we are setting the stage for is a debate on whether the \nFinance Committee will have an opportunity to reduce taxes for families \nand children or, in this particular case where we already have these \ntax reductions in place, to keep them from automatically, without a \nvote of the Congress, going up next year.\n  I want to underscore the word ``opportunity,'' because that is what \nthis debate is all about today on the budget resolution, an \nopportunity--with some assurance because of reconciliation as a shotgun \nbehind the door--for tax reduction.\n  This vote is not about the tax reduction itself. That debate and vote \nwill come later, on the product of our committee, the Finance \nCommittee, when we mark up tax reduction legislation. This vote today \nis about whether we will consider the tax reduction under \nreconciliation or the possibility of using reconciliation because \nreconciliation, just plain and simple, as we sit here today, is the \nonly way that we can guarantee tax relief to the American people in a \ntimely fashion.\n  Now, there have been some very strong statements made by some on the \nother side of the aisle about tax relief and about reconciliation. Let \nme say to those who are worried about this instruction, I, as chairman \nof the Senate Finance Committee, plan to use this as a backstop, not as \nmy primary tool.\n  My hope is that we deliver family tax relief through regular order. I \nwill not use this instruction, should it survive this vote in \nconference, unless we have to. We have reconciled tax cuts on several \noccasions--1995, 1997, 1999, 2001, and we did it last year.\n  The opposition is not based on precedent. The precedent is very \nclear. The measures we are talking about are supported on both sides of \nthe aisle. I am talking about the child tax credit, the marriage \npenalty relief, and expansion of the 10-percent bracket.\n  Let's be clear. If the Congress does not act, we are talking about a \ntax increase for nearly every American who pays taxes. It will also \nhelp out a lot of low-income families with a refundable child tax \ncredit, if we can deliver this relief. That is another thing I would \nsuggest to people on the other side. If they want a refundable child \ncredit and we get into a hassle where it cannot be done through regular \norder, it would seem to me they would want to have a process of \nreconciliation because it guarantees finality. You never get anything \nuntil you get to the finality of votes.\n  A bigger tax credit is a better tax credit. A tax benefit under \nrefundability of $300 per child means a lot to hard-working men and \nwomen in my State, and every State. Keep in mind the opposition has no \nproblem with raising taxes in reconciliation. Somehow that is OK. It \nhas been done many times. If the 1993 Clinton tax increase were \nrepealed today, it would score over $1 trillion over 10 years. Who is \nto say that a $1 trillion tax increase is appropriate in \nreconciliation, that somehow you can use the process of reconciliation \nguaranteeing finality, cutting off debate after 20 hours, OK, if you \nwant to raise taxes. That would be for a $1 trillion tax increase. But \nsomehow it is wrong to do it for a $90 billion tax reduction. \nDemocrats, in 1993, used reconciliation--within their rights from our \nview--to further their President's program, a partisanly designed major \ntax increase. Eleven years later, we are faced with a different \nsituation, though I am hopeful more than one Member on the other side \nwill support the final product. Republicans, by a razor-thin edge, \ncontrol the Congress and have a President of our party in the White \nHouse.\n  I want to make another point that, for those of us on this side of \nthe aisle, is very compelling, especially in the context of our side's \nconcessions in the power-sharing agreement. We believe the Byrd \namendment should not be necessary. Reconciliation affords us a backstop \nto ensure that tax relief stays in place. I hope the Finance Committee \nwill not need reconciliation. Hopefully,\n\n[[Page S2504]]\n\none way or the other, we will get this tax relief.\n  A vote against the Byrd amendment is a vote for an insurance policy \nthat tax relief will get to American families.\n  In closing, I point out this would be a hypothetical family, but \npresently for the year 2004, this family would be paying $6,000 a year \nin taxes. If we don't do anything before this year is out, then \nautomatically certain provisions are going to expire. This family, \nstarting January 1, 2005, is going to be hit with a 26-percent tax \nincrease. You can see it would go up $600 because the $1,000-per-child \ntax credit would expire. When the marriage penalty relief expires, that \nfamily is going to pay $911 more. Why? Just because they are married. \nIf they weren't married, they wouldn't be stuck with this, if they were \nfiling separately. Then because they are going to have expiration of \nthe 10-percent bracket expansion, they will pay $100 more. That is \n$1,611 more in taxes because of inaction by this Congress.\n\n  That is wrong. We have a chance to do something about it. We ought to \ndo something about it. I think we can do something about it in a \nbipartisan way through regular order. But in case we cannot, because \nthis body gets locked up too often--call it a filibuster, it is locked \nup, no finality. It takes a 60-vote supermajority to overcome it; \nsometimes you can't overcome it. Then for this family, they ought to be \nentitled to a reconciliation, shotgun, behind-the-door process so we \ncan guarantee them no tax increase.\n  It is one thing for us to vote a tax increase: it is another thing to \nhave a tax increase because of inaction by this Congress. That could \nhappen. I don't want that to happen. It doesn't have to happen this \nway. We can use regular order. But we ought to provide some assurance \nto this family that they don't get a 26-percent increase in taxes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma is advised he has 7 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I compliment my friend and colleague, the chairman of \nthe Finance Committee. He and I were elected to the Senate together in \n1980. We have been friends ever since. I absolutely love a person who \nhas intensity on issues. I love a person who likes to get things done. \nI love it when we actually do something that makes American families \nbetter.\n  The tax bill we passed last year helps American families. It helps \nthis family with a taxable income of $58,000. I don't know how many \ntimes I have heard that the tax cut is a tax cut for the wealthy and \nthe rich. That is hogwash. This proves it. A married couple making \n$58,000 in taxable income, if they have two kids, saves $1,600. That is \nreal. That is significant. Frankly, it happened in large part because \nof the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Grassley. I \ncompliment him for his work and his speech. He is exactly right.\n  I want to help American families. That is the reason we want to \npreserve this option. I compliment Senator Grassley. I urge our \ncolleagues to vote no on the Byrd amendment when we vote.\n  For the information of our colleagues, I expect we will have three \nrollcall votes probably at 6 o'clock.\n  I yield back the remainder of our time on this amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Might I just take 30 seconds off the resolution?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will withhold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. May I say to my colleagues, I have not heard a single \nSenator who is opposed to extending the middle-class tax cuts. I have \nnot heard a single Senator who is opposed. There is no need for this \nreconciliation instruction for the purposes of tax reduction. The fact \nis, this budget resolution does not assure the money will be used for \nthat purpose. We all know the Senate budget resolution cannot compel \nthe Finance Committee to make any specific decision. Again, I would \njust say to my colleagues, I don't know of a single Senator who is \nopposed to extending the middle-class tax cuts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I wish that was the case. But I would \nlike to say that there has been a lot of politics. Maybe this is more a \npolitical year because of the election. We can't even get conferees for \nthe Workforce Reinforcement Act, a bill that passed unanimously in the \nSenate. Yes, you might say everybody is in favor of it, but people \nmight find a reason not to give consent to pass it or they might say: I \nwill pass it, but I want to offer amendments. And maybe those \namendments would continue to be offered, more and more amendments.\n  Tax codes are interesting. The Senator from North Dakota and I both \nserve on the Finance Committee with Senator Grassley. When you get a \ntax bill on the floor, you could have an unlimited number of \namendments. There are 100 Senators and probably every one of us has \ndifferent ideas on the Tax Code. We might start debating ethanol \nsubsidies because the Senator from New Hampshire and others believe we \nhave overdone it on ethanol. Before you know it, we might not finish \nthis bill.\n  The chairman said he wants to make sure we can get it finished one \nway or another, to make assurances to those families who have kids, or \nthose married couples, that they are going to continue to keep the same \ntaxes so they don't have a tax increase.\n  This is not about tax cuts. This is making sure they don't have a tax \nincrease. The only way we can make sure they don't have tax increases \nis to defeat the Byrd amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of our time on the \nunderlying amendment.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I believe the regular order would be to \nrecognize Senator Warner for his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Virginia is recognized to offer an amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. NICKLES. If the Senator will yield for a moment, I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Momentarily, we will be considering an amendment with \nrespect to the defense budget for the year. That is being worked out \nnow, and Senator Warner will be here momentarily. Perhaps he is almost \nready.\n  I wish to express the opinion that I do not think it is wise to cut \nthe Commander in Chief's defense request when we are at war. I don't \nthink that is the right policy. I don't think it sends the right \nsignal. I personally believe the increase ought to be paid for. But I \nthink we ought to increase the defense request to what the Commander in \nChief has recommended when we are at war.\n  With that, I see Senator Warner, so I will stop until he has made his \npresentation, and then we will have a further opportunity to discuss \nthe pending amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nNorth Dakota. Momentarily, he is quite correct, we will address that.\n  This amendment raises the caps and we do not have an offset in it. We \nbelieve at this point in time the urgency of the matter dictates that \nwe do just what I hope the Senate will do by virtue of adoption of this \namendment.\n  Momentarily, the Senator from Oklahoma will return to the floor and \nperhaps the Senator will ask if we may proceed.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: How is the time \nbeing charged?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time is being charged against the resolution. \nThe quorum calls are being equally divided.\n  Mr. CONRAD. We are not charging time against the amendment then.\n\n[[Page S2505]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I do not want to take action without consulting the other \nside, and the chairman is not in the Chamber at the moment. So I will \nnot make a request at this point. Maybe if we can ask the floor staff \nto check if we want to be charging time to the amendment on an equal \nbasis. I asked that question because we have tried to carefully \ncalibrate this so we would have a voting window starting at 6 o'clock. \nMaybe if people can check, and while that is being done, I will add a \nfew thoughts on this question.\n  I agree with Senator Warner we ought to increase the defense \nallocation to the request of the Commander in Chief when our troops are \nengaged in combat. I think that should be done.\n  I also believe we ought to pay for it. As I understand it, under \nSenator Warner's amendment, the increase will be made to increase the \nbudget allocation to the request by the President--I agree with that--\nbut it will not be paid for. With that I do not agree. When presented \nwith a choice, I will vote to increase the spending to the request by \nthe Commander in Chief because I do not think it is appropriate policy \nnot to fully fund the Commander in Chief's request when our troops are \nengaged in combat half a world away. Our troops right now are engaged \nin direct combat in Iraq and Afghanistan and, of course, in addition to \nthat, we are engaged globally in the war on terror. That does not mean \nwe should not pay for these additional expenditures. Already we see \nrecord budget deficits.\n  We see in this budget resolution the debt of the country being \nincreased by $2.86 trillion over the next 5 years. That is a stunning \namount of money. The assertion by some that the deficit is being \nreduced really pales in consideration and in comparison to what is \nhappening to the debt.\n  The increases in the debt under this budget are simply staggering--\n$2.86 trillion over the next 5 years. That is before the baby boomers \nretire, that is before the full cost of the President's tax cuts \nexplode because they increase geometrically right beyond the budget \nwindow.\n  I would hope we would increase what is in the budget for our national \ndefense to the amount requested by the President, but we do it in a way \nthat is paid for. I think that would be the right approach. \nUnfortunately, Senator Warner's amendment has half of that formula. He \nwill have the increase in funding but will not have the appropriate \noffsets.\n  We will have a vote later on the question of paying for this \nincrease. I hope my colleagues are on notice on what this amendment \nwill involve, and hopefully we will be on this amendment soon.\n  I will withhold my request if the Senator from Missouri wants to take \nsome time. Can we go on to the amendment then? The Senator from \nMissouri will speak with the understanding that the time will, at a \nlater moment, be taken off the time of the amendment so we can try and \nstay on schedule.\n  I thank the Chair. I thank my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I thank my friend from North Dakota for \naccommodating me and allowing me to speak for a few minutes about the \namendment we all know is going to be offered in a few minutes by our \nfriend and colleague, Mr. Warner from Virginia.\n  I do thank and congratulate Chairman Warner and also Chairman \nStevens, not just for producing this amendment I think is so important, \nbut also for their work over the years in sustaining America and \nkeeping faith with the men and women who keep faith with us every day \nand serve us on the front lines and on the back lines and throughout \nthe world to keep our country safe.\n  I want to suggest to the Senate there is no more serious amendment we \nwill consider in this debate on the budget than the one Senator Warner \nis about to offer.\n  America is deeply engaged in the world in all respects, and it should \nbe, it needs to be. It is a difficult task, but it is one we bear every \nday as a nation in a lot of different ways.\n  Yet despite all our other efforts, despite our diplomatic efforts, \ndespite our participation in international organizations, despite the \ncoalitions we have built around the world, despite our foreign aid, \ndespite our exhortations based on our philosophy, despite the power of \nour ideas, as important as all of that is, America's security and the \nsecurity of our allies and our friends around the world depends and \ncontinues to depend on the reality and the perception of our military \npower.\n  That is what is at stake in this amendment today. The President of \nthe United States has submitted a defense budget which states a \nrequirement of $421 billion for the national defense. In my judgment, \nthat is quite probably too low. I have argued for 10 years, first in \nthe House and now in the Senate, that we are not adequately funding our \ndefense establishment.\n  I simply offer very briefly as evidence of that the fact the Joint \nChiefs of Staff recently submitted, in response to a question from \nCongressman Ike Skelton, my old and dear friend from the other body, \nabout what their unfunded requirements were. In other words, what are \ntheir requirements they were not able to get into the President's \nbudget.\n  They submitted $12 billion in unfunded requirements, and that is just \ntheir top priorities: $6 billion for the Army; $2.5 billion, roughly, \nfor the Navy; $2.5 billion for the Air Force. I think it is more than \nthat, based on my years of experience. I believe we could add $15 \nbillion to $20 billion to the budget for procurement alone without \noverfunding America's military. I will explain in a minute why we are \nin this position.\n  The Army needs to be bigger. I supported an amendment that was \noffered by the Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. Reed, last year to \nincrease the size of the Army. I think it needs to be another 30,000 to \n40,000 men and women. I am pleased to say the administration is moving \nin that direction now, at least on a temporary basis, but that \nrequirement was not included in the President's budget. Half of \nmilitary housing is inadequate. That was not provided for in the \nPresident's budget. There are other quality-of-life needs we would like \nto meet.\n  Many of us here would like to resolve the issue of concurrent \nreceipt, for example, so we can allow our military retirees who also \nhave a military disability pension to keep both their retirement they \nearned and the disability benefits they deserve. That is not included \nin the budget. I could go on on behalf of my belief that the $421 \nbillion the President has asked for is probably too low.\n\n  Now, I am sure it will be said by some in the debate on this \namendment that the President's budget increases defense from last year \nby 7 percent and that is too great. That is above the rate of \ninflation.\n  Our spending on defense as a percentage of gross domestic product is \nless than it was prior to World War II. We spent 47 percent of our \ndiscretionary funds on defense in 2002 compared to 60 percent in 1990, \nand we are at war. It is time for us to get as serious as the men and \nwomen in America's military are about winning this war.\n  I went into the Congress in 1993. It was just after the outgoing \nfirst Bush administration had, in response to the cold war, cut the \nsize of America's military establishment by about a quarter to \nestablish what they called the Bush base force, which, by the way, is \nprobably about what we need today, in my judgment.\n  The incoming Clinton administration then cut the size of the force an \nadditional 25 percent, to about a third, depending on which branch of \nthe service we are talking about. I argued all throughout the 1990s \nthat we were not funding even that undersized force adequately.\n  All throughout those years, we were tacitly engaging in the \nassumption in this Congress that there was not any real threat to the \nUnited States; that with the end of the cold war in some sense history \nhad ended as well.\n  Well, history had not ended. It had not ended all those years. It was \njust frozen and it thawed out with a vengeance on September 11. All the \nethnic and regional rivalries of the world--fanaticism, nationalism, \nextremism--have risen up now to threaten us and once again we \nrediscover we do, indeed, need America's military and we do, indeed, \nneed to fund it.\n\n[[Page S2506]]\n\n  The question today is whether we are going to be serious on behalf of \nthat responsibility. The force is too old. The reason it is too old is \nthat all throughout the 1990s we were not buying enough new, what they \ncall in the military, platforms, trucks, and planes.\n  When the capital stock is not replenished, it gets old. The average \nage of an aircraft in the U.S. Air Force is 22 years; the bombers, over \n40 years; Navy and Marine aircraft, 18 years. We do not have enough \nships in the Navy. We have 294 ships in the Navy. The Chief of Naval \nOperations, the Chief of Staff of the Navy, says we need 20 more today. \nHis vision for the future is 375 ships, and we are not buying enough to \nget us there. We are not buying enough to maintain a 300-ship Navy.\n  I could go on. I have done it before, at least when I served in the \nother body. Some evening I will probably have occasion to spend 45 \nminutes or an hour discussing this.\n  To his credit, and in the face of the threat presented by the \nterrorist war, President Bush has regularly submitted substantial \nincreases in the defense budget to this Congress. To its credit, this \nCongress has supported those increases. Along with the tremendous \ndedication of America's military and the vision and leadership of those \nwho are running it, it is helping. We need to stay at least on that \ncourse.\n  It would be almost a historical abdication of our responsibilities \nwere we not to provide for at least the amount of money the President \nof the United States has asked for America's military while America's \nmilitary is fighting a war for us.\n  The only argument against it is that the deficit is a problem. Well, \nyes, the deficit is a problem. We are in a war. Members who do not \nbelieve that should read about it. It is in the papers every day. We \nare in a war. We are also in a recession.\n  I have not gone back and checked the Almanacs but I cannot imagine a \ntime when the United States has been in a war and a recession and has \nnot run a deficit. If my colleagues are worried about the deficit, let \nme suggest what will increase the deficit: If we lose the war, I \nguarantee that will increase the deficit. We do not have to lose it; we \njust have to suffer another significant attack on our homeland, and it \ncan happen. That will increase the deficit. In fact, all we have to do \nis encourage America's enemies--and we have enemies around the world--\nto believe that we will not see this through, that we will retreat. I \nguarantee that will increase the deficit a lot more than the amendment \nof the Senator from Virginia proposes to do.\n  Let's not be shortsighted. I have confidence that this Senate will \nnot be. I do not want to sound like a scold; I really do not. I am \nproud of what the Congress has done the last few years in supporting \nour military.\n  I serve on the Armed Services Committee. I am proud to be on that \ncommittee. An hour ago I left a hearing, which I had the honor of \nchairing, of the Seapower Subcommittee, where Senator Kennedy is the \nranking member. We had several hours in which we considered the \ncapacity of our military to move goods around the world. One of the \nareas of jurisdiction of the subcommittee is on airlift and the \ncapacity of our marine resources, civilian and military, to move goods \naround the world. I was astounded, amazed, and encouraged by how much \nwe have improved the efficiency of that part of the service. We are all \nin debt to the men and women who work there and who run that, both \ncivilian and military. I am pleased this Congress has sustained their \nefforts, and I know we will sustain the efforts of our men and women in \nAmerica's military today.\n  They are doing their job. The question is whether we are going to do \nours. They are watching. Our enemies are watching to see what the \nSenate does today. I am not sure exactly the form in which the Warner \namendment will be offered. I do know it will restore the approximately \n$7 billion that the committee reduced and cut from the President's \nsubmission. We need to pass that amendment. We need to do our job in \nwinning this war and protecting the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I believe, under the consent request that we had entered \ninto previously, we have had debate on the reconciliation amendment by \nSenator Byrd. I believe next in order would be Senator Warner to offer \nan amendment, and then Feingold on the pay-go amendment. It is our \nintention to vote on all three of these back to back hopefully as close \nto 6 as possible. We have had a little break, and I apologize for that, \nbut it would be our intention to try to have debate on both amendments \nand vote as close to 6 as possible.\n  I now yield to my friend and colleague Senator Warner to manage our \ntime on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it is my understanding that there is an \nhour equally divided. Am I correct on that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank both managers of the bill for \ntheir cooperation.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield for just a moment?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. One of the things we discussed, if I can say, is there \nwas a slight amount of time used here in discussion on the amendment. \nOne of the things that was discussed was the possibility, perhaps, of \ncharging that time to the amendment once we got on the amendment so we \ncould hold to the schedule of being as close to 6 o'clock as we could \nbe. Would that be agreeable?\n  Mr. WARNER. No objection.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, how much time had both sides used?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri used 11 minutes, and \nthe other side has not used any.\n  Mr. CONRAD. We did, actually. I spoke.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent there be 40 \nminutes on the amendment to be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2742\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner] for himself and Mr. \n     Stevens, Mr. McCain, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Roberts, Ms. Collins, \n     Mr. Chambliss, Mr. Graham of South Carolina, and Mr. Talent, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2742.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in this amendment, I am joined by Senator \nStevens, Senator McCain, Senator Inhofe, Senator Roberts, Senator \nCollins, Senator Chambliss, Senator Graham, Senator Craig, and Senator \nTalent.\n  The amendment is very simple. It restores funding for the Department \nof Defense to the level requested by the President for fiscal year \n2005. Specifically, this amendment will add $6.9 billion to the level \ncontained in the pending budget resolution for the national defense 050 \nbudget function.\n  As we review our budget priorities for the coming year, it is clear \nmany important programs must compete for limited resources. Hard \nchoices must be made. As we individually wrestle with the hard choices \nwe must make, I remind my colleagues we have no more solemn \nresponsibility than that imposed by the Constitution of the United \nStates and that is to provide for the common defense of this great \nNation, the United States. This is the most important function of the \nFederal Government.\n  The President requested $420.7 billion for defense-related activities \nfor fiscal year 2005. That request includes funding for the Department \nof Defense, the defense activities of the Department of Energy--that's \nroughly two-thirds of the total Department of Energy budget--and a \nsignificant amount for the intelligence community.\n  Our military service chiefs--the Chief of Naval Operations, Chief of \nStaff of the Army, the Commandant of the Marine Corps, Chief of Staff \nof the Air Force--all four service chiefs came before the committee and \nasked that we authorize and obtain the full amount requested by the \nPresident.\n  As you well know, having spent a considerable portion of my career in \nthe Department of Defense, each year the President goes to the \nDepartment for their recommendations, a budget is made up and it is \nsubmitted and it finally is submitted to the Office of Management and \nBudget on behalf of the President and Congress.\n  Recognition must be given that we are a nation at war. Those are the \nvery words used by our distinguished colleague, the manager of this \nbill, moments ago. Terrorists brought this war to our shores on \nSeptember 11, 2001. President Bush, together with a coalition of \nnations, responded forcefully and effectively. This Chamber provided a \nresolution expressing support for the President to bring the war on \nterrorism to the terrorists.\n  Hundreds of thousands of our servicemen and women are now deployed \naround the world defending our Nation in Operation Enduring Freedom, \nOperation Iraqi Freedom, and other military operations in the ongoing \nwar on terrorism. Hundreds of thousands more are forward deployed in \nKorea, the Balkans, at sea and elsewhere, protecting American interests \nand deterring aggression.\n  I wonder if our Nation realizes that well over half of the United \nStates Army today, some 320,000 men and women, proud to wear the \nuniform of the United States Army, are deployed overseas, over half of \nthe total standing Army--leaving their families behind, going into \nharm's way to protect us. Others stand vigilant at our borders and at \nour ports and in our skies here at home. We have an obligation, in my \njudgment, to live up to the President's budget request, which budget \nrequest was carefully prepared in consultation with the Chiefs and \nother senior members of the defense force.\n  What have our Armed Forces accomplished in the last few years? The \nsimple answer is, everything we have asked of them and more. They have \nconfronted brutal regimes in Afghanistan, and Iraq and given the people \nof those regions hope, and an opportunity to experience freedom and \ndemocracy. In Iraq, together with a coalition of nations, they \nliberated a repressed nation--a country larger than Germany and Italy \ncombined--in roughly 3 weeks. The Armed Forces accomplished this with \nunprecedented precision, and with casualties far below estimates. This \nlevel of professionalism is what we have come to expect of our \nmilitary.\n  Such expectations must be tempered by the realization that the \nmagnificent professionalism of our Armed Forces is a product of strong \nleadership, patriotic young men and women, supportive families, great \nAmerican technology, and strong, consistent resources. All of these \nthings require the long term support of the Congress in the form of \nfunding, guidance and support.\n  At a time of unprecedented demands on our military, it is critical \nthat we provide our men and women in uniform--active, reserve, and \nNational Guard--the funding they need to continue to successfully \naccomplish their missions. To meet the challenges we now face around \nthe world, and to prepare for the future, the President has proposed a \nbudget that includes $420.7 billion for national defense. It is a \nprudent request that maintains the readiness of our current force and \nmakes the investments necessary to develop and field the capabilities \nthat will keep our Nation safe from the uncertain threats of the \nfuture.\n  We are blessed with a military that has responded to the demands of a \npost-September 11 world with extraordinary commitment, but even the \nbest military has its limits. The pace of recent operations is putting \nincreased demands on our forces around the world, increased demands on \nour Reserve and National Guard units, and increased demands on military \nfamilies. Our military has dedicated personnel--active duty, reserve, \nguard and retirees--and families who must be fairly compensated with \ncompetitive pay and a good quality of life. Our military has equipment \nthat has been heavily used in recent operations that must be repaired \nor replaced, and new capabilities that must be developed and procured \nto meet future threats. And finally, our military has an aging \ninfrastructure that must be modernized.\n  In my opinion, the President's budget request for defense has struck \nthe proper balance to accomplish these goals. At this critical time in \nthe war against terror, when we are asking so much of our uniformed \npersonnel and their families, and when we are seeking the continued \ncooperation of our allies, what message do we want to send? We must \nsend a message of continued commitment and resolve by supporting the \nlevel of funding for defense requested by the President. Our military \ndeserves no less.\n  At this time, Mr. President, I yield the floor and grant such time as \nthe distinguished Senator from Alaska may desire\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, in a time of war, and we are at war--we \nare at war against terrorism; that's the leading war we are still \ninvolved in; we\n\n[[Page S2508]]\n\nhave activities in Haiti; we have them in Afghanistan and they are \npersisting in Iraq--it is my feeling the request of the Commander in \nChief should be met in full, and that's what this amendment does. It \nmeets in full the request of the President, submitted in his budget for \nthe activities of the Department of Defense not directly connected with \nIraq and Afghanistan. We are going to see that in a supplemental, I \nassume, sometime after the first of the year.\n  But as a practical matter, this budget is a very thin budget for a \nmilitary stretched as thin as it is right now around the world. As the \nSenator from Virginia says, more than half of our men and women in \nuniform are outside the United States at this time. It is a matter of \njust simple justice, as far as I am concerned. The Commander in Chief's \nrequest should be honored. I hope the Senate will support this request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I support the amendment by the Senator \nfrom Virginia, the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee. He has been a member of the committee for many years. He \nunderstands our defense and national security needs.\n  I believe the fundamental message is we are in a war. We are in a \nwar. We are in a war. The fact is this money is needed in order to \nprosecute the conflicts in Afghanistan, in Iraq, and around the world, \nas we fight the war on terrorism and attempt to thwart the possibility \nof a terrorist attack on the United States of America and our citizens.\n  Clearly, we are going through a period of transition in the military, \nand one that is going to be somewhat expensive, but there is no doubt \nwe have to adjust our military in order to meet the needs of an ever-\nchanging and, in some respects, larger threat to our security than we \nhave faced in the past few years.\n  Also, I have the greatest respect for our colleagues here in the \nSenate and the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee and the \nranking member. But I did note, with some interest, that the chairman \nof the Budget Committee in the House suggested a moratorium on earmarks \nfor 1 year. Why would he do that?\n  Well, I show my colleagues a very interesting Congressional Research \nService chart which shows that in 1994, there were 4,126 earmarks; in \n1996, it went down to 3,023 earmarks; and it has gone steadily up \ngeometrically; and in 2004, there were 14,040 earmarks--amounting to a \ngrand total of $47.9 billion--$47.9 billion.\n  Rather than cut $7 billion out of defense, why don't we cut $7 \nbillion out of $47.9 billion of pork-barrel projects, such as the $3 \nmillion to study the DNA of bears in Montana, the Cowgirls and Cowboys \nHall of Fame, and the elves up in North Pole, AK, that got some more \nmoney this time?\n  Why don't we cut $7 billion out of $47.9 billion in earmarked funds? \nThat comes from the Congressional Research Service, up from $23.7 \nbillion in 1996. Why don't we show some courage, make some choices, and \ncut this, rather than cutting $7 billion out of defense?\n  I would hope my colleagues on the Budget Committee at some point \nwould seriously consider a moratorium on earmarks--just for 1 year. It \nmight be a nice thing to see.\n  Mr. President, I support the amendment from the Senator from Virginia \nand I hope the choices we make are not to cut into our Nation's \nsecurity but to cut into the pork-barrel spending which has absolutely \nrun amok in this body. It is a disgrace, and there is no excuse for it. \nI hope we will start attacking the wasteful and pork-barrel spending \nrather than the men and women in the military.\n  I support the amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I compliment my colleagues, Senators \nStevens and Warner. I intend to support this request.\n  Senator Stevens, when I first brought to his attention that we needed \nto stay with the cap of 814, brought to my attention very strongly, \nrepeatedly, that he wanted to have the President's full request in. \nThis amendment does that.\n  The reason we brought a resolution out at 814 was to make sure a \nbudget point of order wouldn't lie against the entire resolution and \nfrankly kill the resolution. We would have to have 60 votes. The \namendment Senator Stevens and Senator Warner are introducing fully \nfunds the President's request and frankly it increases the caps to do \nso. It takes 60 votes to pass the amendment. It increases the deficit \nby $7 billion. It means we are going to have increases in defense \nspending by $27 billion, 7.1 percent. It is a big increase, but frankly \nwe have big challenges with our defense.\n  I happen to agree with Senators Warner and Stevens, when we have \ntroops in the field who have their lives in jeopardy day by day, being \nfired upon, we need to give them support as requested by their \nCommander in Chief.\n  I hope our colleagues will support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, can the Chair advise me what the time \nsituation is on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 12 minutes 50 seconds remaining on \nthe Republican side, 20 minutes on the Democratic side.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, speaking for our side, I again want to \nindicate I intend to fully support the amendment of the Senator from \nVirginia, joined in by the Senator from Alaska. Is this a Stevens-\nWarner amendment at this point?\n  I just think we need to send a very clear message. When we are at \nwar, when our troops are in jeopardy, when they are in combat zones, \nwhen the Commander in Chief makes a request, we need to honor that \nrequest.\n  Look, I believe we ought to pay for this increase. I believe we ought \nto offset it with either additional revenues or spending cuts in other \nareas because the deficit is at record levels now and this just \nincreases it. We are seeing dramatic increases in the debt.\n  We had a right to offer second-degree amendments to this amendment to \nprovide a pay-for. We basically did not exercise that right, in an \nagreement to get a number of amendments up and voted on before 7 \no'clock tonight. But it is our intention, with a later amendment, to \noffer a means of paying for this increase.\n  Without that before us at the moment, the choice becomes do we \nincrease the defense expenditure to meet the request of the Commander \nin Chief or do we not?\n  I believe the imperative is clear. I believe we must raise the \ndefense expenditure level to meet the request of the Commander in Chief \nwhen we have troops in combat half a world away fighting day and night \nfor this country.\n  It is my intention to ask our colleagues to support the Warner-\nStevens amendment. At a later time, it will then be my intention to ask \nour colleagues on both sides to find a way to pay for it and to suggest \nspecific ways we might do that. I hope colleagues will keep an open \nmind on that subsequent amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I very much appreciate the support of \nSenator Conrad on this amendment. We have worked together now on two or \nthree amendments. We have agreed to some amendments. That is good \nprogress.\n  I also want to correct the Record. I said it was my understanding \nthat this increases the defense amount by 7.1 percent. That is the OMB \nfigure. The Congressional Budget Office figure is 6.8 percent. I was \naccurate by saying it would increase defense spending by $27 billion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, this budget resolution is $6.9 billion \nbelow the President's request for defense spending for fiscal year \n2005. I am voting for the Warner amendment to restore this cut.\n  I am doing so because I believe we should pay for our activities in \nIraq\n\n[[Page S2509]]\n\nand Afghanistan within the budget. I do not believe we should pretend \nthose costs do not exist and then have the President come back to \nCongress saying we did not give him enough money and he needs more.\n  We must have truth in budgeting. The costs of our operations in Iraq \nand Afghanistan should be included in the budget; the costs should be \npaid for with regularly budgeted funds. The alternative is further \nescalating debt.\n  I am extremely concerned about the runaway debt. If we do not include \nin the budget the costs of our operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, the \nPresident will come back with a request for emergency supplemental \nfunds. Those funds do not have to be offset, thereby adding billions of \ndollars to our national debt.\n  Therefore, I will vote for the Warner amendment to restore the cut in \ndefense spending.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I presume the managers desire to have this \namendment laid aside for the present time, unless there are other \nspeakers.\n  I yield such time as the Senator from Oklahoma desires.\n  Mr. President, would you advise the Senator from Virginia the amount \nof time we have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eleven minutes forty seconds.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Senator from South Carolina desires a \ncouple of minutes following the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I will be very brief. I think everything I \nwould have said has been said by our chairman, Senator Warner.\n  We have 325,000 troops scattered around 120 different countries. I \nchaired the Subcommittee on Readiness for a number of years. That was \nduring the 1990s when we were making cuts in our defense across the \nboard in terms of end strength, in terms of numbers of divisions and \nnumbers of tactical air wings, in terms of the numbers of ships, in \nterms of modernization, and in terms of readiness. It was very \ndisturbing during that time. I was outspoken at that time that we might \nbe going too far.\n  Recently we went through this thing of not having adequate body \narmor. Of course, the Army, in this case, responded with our help and \nwe are able to say now they are taken care of adequately.\n  In modernization, we are going into the future combat system. We were \ndelayed in the 1990s. Now things are getting back on track. However, we \noften say we want our troops, our men and women in uniform, to have the \nvery best of equipment and the best support.\n  Quite frankly, we don't have as good equipment as some of our \npotential adversaries in the case of our artillery. We are still \ndealing with World War II technologies when there are five countries \nthat have made a better case than we have. I don't think the American \npeople want our young people going into combat with anything except the \nbest. That is what this is about. We are in a rebuilding mode right \nnow. We are talking about transforming all branches. We are talking \nabout changing the way our troops are stationed around the world. This \nis going to be expensive. We are in the middle of a war. I strongly \nsupport the increases recommended by the chairman, Senator Warner.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, I rise in support of the \namendment offered by our chairman. I thank the chairman, Senator \nWarner, for doing something that is not easy. We pride ourselves on \ntrying to be fiscal conservatives and taking care of the country's \nneeds and the President's budget request for the military. I applaud \nour chairman, Senator Warner, for offering this amendment to make sure \nwe can get the money the President thinks we need to defend the Nation.\n  One thing I have learned about this whole process is I would not want \nSenator Nickles' job. It is very hard to put a budget together which \ndoes what we need to do for the economy and for defense of the Nation \nand other domestic priorities.\n  But I know where this debate is going. It won't be long before we \nwill have an amendment to counter this amendment saying, all right, we \nwill agree that the military needs more money. I am glad we agree with \nthat, because they do. But then they will start arguing, let us pay for \nit; let us be fiscally responsible, and let us take money from this \ngroup to pay for it. We are going to get into a partisan fight in the \nname of fiscal responsibility that probably doesn't have a whole lot to \ndo with fiscal responsibility. I think that is sad but we know it is \ncoming.\n  Let me say this: The No. 1 job of being a Senator, in my opinion, is \nto make sure we can defend America. We can have all the fights about \nhow you create jobs, and I would argue to my friend--I will be glad to \nspeak on this proposal--if you are worried about losing jobs in \nAmerica, then you need to be more friendly to people who are trying to \ncreate jobs in America. You are not a very friendly crowd to job \ncreation with your proposals. But we will talk about that down the \nroad. I know it is coming.\n  Let me say this: It is good news for the men and women in uniform at \nthis point in time because we have bipartisan support to make sure \nthere is budget authority to defend America. I thank the chairman on \ntheir behalf. I look forward to the debate to come about this issue in \nterms of domestic politics. But I hope we don't get unnecessarily off \nscript for the men and women who depend on us making sure they have the \nequipment when we ask them to fight the war. They probably don't \nappreciate a lot of the fussing and fighting.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains under the control of the Senator \nfrom Virginia?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 7 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we will yield our time if the other side \nwill yield their time and go on to the next matter.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we are prepared to yield back time on this \nside. I yield all but 5 minutes of our time reserved for Senator Levin. \nWe can proceed with Senator Feingold.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank our colleague, Senator Warner, \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee, and also Chairman Stevens of \nthe Appropriations Committee for their cooperation on this amendment. I \nam sure the Commander in Chief is grateful for this amendment. I am \nsure the Chiefs of Staff of the Armed Forces are grateful for this \namendment.\n  For the information of our colleagues, this amendment, in addition to \nSenator Byrd's amendment and I believe Senator Feingold's amendment, \nwill be voted on probably a little before 6 o'clock. Also, for the \ninformation of our colleagues, I know there are other amendments out \nthere. Senator Conrad and I already realize we are running short on \ntime and the number of days. We are going to finish this bill by \nFriday. I encourage our colleagues to either not offer amendments or at \nleast work with us so we can accept or dispose of some amendments in \none way or another. But if they have amendments, please bring those to \nour attention tonight. It is our intention to work very late tonight. I \nhate to do that because our very good friend, Chairman Stevens, is \nhaving a nice event that I would love to attend, but I think our \nbusiness is to complete the budget this week.\n  For the information of our colleagues, we expect three rollcall votes \nshortly before 6 o'clock. I believe the regular order of business now \nwould be for Senator Feingold to offer his amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we have just now tallied all the \namendments that have been noticed. I know the chairman will be \ninterested to know there are 98 amendments pending. Let me say those \nare amendments that have been noticed to us. They are not necessarily \npending before the Senate, but Senators have given notice they intend \nto offer 98 amendments. It takes 1 hour to handle three amendments. \nThat would be 33 hours of straight voting. We have to get serious. We \ncannot have a circumstance in which we spend 33 straight hours voting \non amendments to the budget resolution. That is an unreasonable \nproposition. It is an\n\n[[Page S2510]]\n\nunreasonable proposition for the Members, and an unreasonable \nproposition for the administrative staff.\n\n  I am sending the message to our colleagues, let's eliminate the \nduplication. Let's ask Senators to refrain from offering amendments \nthat can be offered later to appropriations bills or to other \nlegislative vehicles. We cannot have 98 amendments voted on this budget \nresolution. There is no way we would finish by Friday. We have agreed \non a common goal of finishing the budget resolution by Friday. We have \nworked in good faith together. Please, colleagues, let's show some \nrestraint.\n  We will turn it over to our Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. Feingold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2748\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the managers for making it \npossible for me to offer this amendment at this time. I send an \namendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold], for himself, Mr. \n     Chafee, Mr. Baucus, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Carper, and Mr. Graham \n     of Florida, proposes an amendment numbered 2748.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       (Purpose: To fully reinstate the pay-as-you-go requirement)\n\n       On page 46, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 408. PAY-AS-YOU-GO POINT OF ORDER IN THE SENATE.\n\n       (a) Point of Order.--\n       (1) In general.--It shall not be in order in the Senate to \n     consider any direct spending or revenue legislation that \n     would increase the on-budget deficit or cause an on-budget \n     deficit for any one of the three applicable time periods as \n     measured in paragraphs (5) and (6).\n       (2) Applicable time periods.--For purposes of this \n     subsection, the term ``applicable time period'' means any 1 \n     of the 3 following periods:\n       (A) The first year covered by the most recently adopted \n     concurrent resolution on the budget.\n       (B) The period of the first 5 fiscal years covered by the \n     most recently adopted concurrent resolution on the budget.\n       (C) The period of the 5 fiscal years following the first 5 \n     fiscal years covered in the most recently adopted concurrent \n     resolution on the budget.\n       (3) Direct-spending legislation.--For purposes of this \n     subsection and except as provided in paragraph (4), the term \n     ``direct-spending legislation'' means any bill, joint \n     resolution, amendment, motion, or conference report that \n     affects direct spending as that term is defined by, and \n     interpreted for purposes of, the Balanced Budget and \n     Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985.\n       (4) Exclusion.--For purposes of this subsection, the terms \n     ``direct-spending legislation'' and ``revenue legislation'' \n     do not include--\n       (A) any concurrent resolution on the budget; or\n       (B) any provision of legislation that affects the full \n     funding of, and continuation of, the deposit insurance \n     guarantee commitment in effect on the date of enactment of \n     the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990.\n       (5) Baseline.--Estimates prepared pursuant to this section \n     shall--\n       (A) use the baseline surplus or deficit used for the most \n     recently adopted concurrent resolution on the budget; and\n       (B) be calculated under the requirements of subsections (b) \n     through (d) of section 257 of the Balanced Budget and \n     Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 for fiscal years beyond \n     those covered by that concurrent resolution on the budget.\n       (6) Prior surplus.--If direct spending or revenue \n     legislation increases the on-budget deficit or causes an on-\n     budget deficit when taken individually, it must also increase \n     the on-budget deficit or cause an on-budget deficit when \n     taken together with all direct spending and revenue \n     legislation enacted since the beginning of the calendar year \n     not accounted for in the baseline under paragraph (5)(A), \n     except that direct spending or revenue effects resulting in \n     net deficit reduction enacted pursuant to reconciliation \n     instructions since the beginning of that same calendar year \n     shall not be available.\n       (b) Waiver.--This section may be waived or suspended in the \n     Senate only by the affirmative vote of three-fifths of the \n     Members, duly chosen and sworn.\n       (c) Appeals.--Appeals in the Senate from the decisions of \n     the Chair relating to any provision of this section shall be \n     limited to 1 hour, to be equally divided between, and \n     controlled by, the appellant and the manager of the bill or \n     joint resolution, as the case may be. An affirmative vote of \n     three-fifths of the Members of the Senate, duly chosen and \n     sworn, shall be required to sustain an appeal of the ruling \n     of the Chair on a point of order raised under this section.\n       (d) Determination of Budget Levels.--For purposes of this \n     section, the levels of new budget authority, outlays, and \n     revenues for a fiscal year shall be determined on the basis \n     of estimates made by the Committee on the Budget of the \n     Senate.\n       (e) Sunset.--This section shall expire on September 30, \n     2009.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am very pleased to offer this \namendment with Senators Chafee, Baucus, Cantwell, Carper, and Graham.\n  This amendment is very straightforward. It would simply reinstate the \npay-as-you-go rule that has been such an effective restraint on the \nfiscal appetites of Congress and the White House.\n  The last 3 years have seen a dramatic deterioration in the \nGovernment's ability to perform one of its most fundamental jobs, and \nthat is balancing the Nation's fiscal boxes. We are all familiar with \nthe history. In January of 2001, the Congressional Budget Office \nactually projected in the 10 years thereafter, Government would run a \nunified budget surplus of more than $5 trillion. A little more than 3 \nyears later, we are now, unfortunately, staring at almost a mirror \nimage of that 10-year, $5 trillion surplus. Instead of healthy \nsurpluses, under any reasonable set of assumptions, we are now facing \nimmense deficits.\n  We must stop running deficits because they cause the Government to \nuse the surpluses of the Social Security trust fund for other \nGovernment purposes rather than to pay down the debt and help our \nNation prepare for the coming retirement of the baby boom generation.\n  We have to stop running deficits because every dollar we add to the \nFederal debt is another dollar we are forcing our children to pay back \nin higher taxes or fewer Government benefits.\n  When the Government in this generation chooses to spend on current \nconsumption and to accumulate debt for our children's generation to \npay, it does nothing less than rob our children of their own choices. \nWe make our choices to spend on our wants, but we saddle them with \ndebts they must pay from their tax dollars and their hard work. That is \nnot right.\n  This is also why I am offering this amendment to fully reinstate the \npay-as-you-go rule. We need a strong budget process. We need to exert \nfiscal discipline. This amendment would simply return us to the rules \nby which Congress played for the decade of the 1990s. It would \neliminate the exceptions to pay-as-you-go included in last year's \nresolution that exempt new tax cuts and new mandatory spending included \nin a budget resolution. The reason we have to get rid of these \nexceptions is these exceptions facilitate more damage to the Federal \nbottom line.\n  I recognize there are some who prefer to provide some exemptions for \ncertain tax and spending policies. In particular, the argument has been \nmade that we ought to exempt the extension of the 10-percent bracket, \nthe child care tax credit, and the marriage penalty provisions. The \nargument is that these, and possibly other policies, are so worthy that \nthey should not be subjected to pay as you go.\n  Let me offer what I think are two valid responses to this. First, \nwhile there are certainly worthy tax provisions included in the \nassumptions underlying this resolution, including those I just listed, \nas the chairman of the committee has pointed out very effectively in \nthe Senate, no budget resolution can actually specify which taxes must \nbe cut and which must be raised. The resolution can set forth levels of \ntax cuts, but it cannot specify which taxes are cut. It follows that \nthe resolution cannot specify which tax cuts should be exempt from \nbudget enforcement. It can exempt some level of tax cuts from that \nenforcement, as indeed this resolution does.\n\n  But a budget resolution cannot specify which specific tax cuts are to \nbe exempt from budget enforcement. So we have no guarantee at all that \nthese popular and worthy tax cuts I just mentioned, those three, would \nend up being the ones that would benefit from this exemption that \nexempts tax cuts from the normal pay-as-you-go requirement on which we \nhave to get the 60 votes to waive the rule.\n  The second reason, for the specific tax cuts I mentioned earlier--the \n10-\n\n[[Page S2511]]\n\npercent bracket, the child tax credit, and the marriage penalty \nprovision--I am absolutely sure there will be far more than 60 votes to \nwaive any point of order against those provisions. I even wonder if \nanyone will propose to put us in a position where we have to waive a \npoint of order. Someone will have to actually raise a point of order. \nThese three sorts of tax cuts have such strong support that it is not, \nin my view, a serious or genuine objection that the pay-as-you-go rule \nwill prevent them from being extended and continuing.\n  Reinstating the pay-as-you-go rule makes it harder for this body to \nmake the deficit worse. It does not prohibit these tax cuts. It does \nnot make it impossible to have a tax cut. It just makes it a little \nharder. That is as it should be. Given our current budget position, we \nought to make it harder to make the deficit worse. If new tax cuts or \nnew mandatory spending is not to be offset, then they ought to be only \nthe most worthy of policies, not just anything that can get a majority \nvote. They ought to be policies that can achieve the 60 votes needed to \nwaive a point of order.\n  It is very simple. That is what this amendment would do. It is the \nleast we should do to ensure fiscal responsibility and sound budgeting. \nWe must stop using Social Security surpluses to fund other Government \nprograms. We must stop piling up debt for our children to pay off. We \nmust continue the discipline of the budget process.\n  This is one of those situations where after you have been here a \nwhile, you can actually speak from experience. I can speak from \nexperience of having watched in this body. As I came in 1993, we had \nthe largest deficit in American history. Were it not for these budget \nrules, if it were not for the pay-as-you-go rules, I am certain the \nparties would not have come together as we did over those years to \nachieve what almost no one thought was possible--a very solid surplus. \nWithout these rules, the discipline goes away. Without these rules, we \nare back to the behavior of the 1980s, which my constituents so \nthoroughly condemn: Unlimited tax cuts on unlimited spending, the blank \nchecks that were written that put this Nation in its worst deficit to \ndate.\n  We now have a much worse deficit. We now have the largest deficit in \nAmerican history. It is incumbent upon this body to go back to what we \nknow worked, to what we know put the parties in a healthy competition, \nto see which party could be more fiscally responsible. We desperately \nneed to return to that discipline now.\n  That is why I urge my colleagues to accept this amendment that will \nreturn the pay-as-you-go rules in full.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, look, now we are starting to talk about \namendments that are just critically important if we are going to start \nto do something about the skyrocketing deficits and the accumulation of \ndebt.\n  The pay-go provisions are budget disciplines to make it harder to add \nto deficits. We have used these provisions in the past successfully to \nmove from record deficits to record surpluses.\n  In just a few moments, this body is going to vote on whether it is \ngoing to renew those disciplines or we are just going to abandon the \nship and keep right on running up an ocean of red ink.\n  This year, we are poised to run a deficit in record terms of over \n$470 billion--$100 billion more than last year. And last year's deficit \nwas almost $100 billion more than the previous record.\n  This is an opportunity for Senators to stand and be counted and be \nheld accountable. Are we going to go back to the budget disciplines \nthat have worked in the past or are we going to let them lapse? They \nlapsed in 2002, they have not been reinstituted, and the deficit has \nskyrocketed.\n  What this amendment does is to put back in place the fundamental \ndisciplines that say simply this: If you want new mandatory spending, \nif you want new tax cuts, you can have them, but you have to pay for \nthem. It is that simple.\n  Some will say, Well, this does not discipline discretionary spending, \nwhich is a third of Federal spending. That is true. We discipline \ndiscretionary spending by spending caps. We have a spending cap in \nplace.\n  The question before us is, Are we going to reenact the budget \ndisciplines on mandatory spending, which is two-thirds of Federal \nspending? Are we going to replace the budget disciplines on the revenue \nside of the equation, which have been allowed to lapse?\n  Let me just put up a statement by the chairman of the Federal Reserve \non this question. Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan, on restoring pay-\ngo, said:\n\n       I would, first, Mr. Chairman, restore pay-go and \n     discretionary caps. Without a process for evaluating various \n     trade-offs, I see no way that any group such as a Congress \n     can come to a set of priorities which will be effectively \n     reflecting the will of the American people.\n\n  Mr. President, this is the test: this vote. This is going to answer \nwho stands for budget discipline, who stands for getting these deficits \nand debt under control, and who is going to sit on the sidelines and \nallow these deficits and debt to continue to skyrocket out of control.\n  For those who say they are fiscally responsible, here is the test. \nHere is the test. All the talk is going to be measured in this vote. Do \nyou stand for restoring the budget disciplines that have worked in the \npast or do you not? That is the question.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, does the Senator from North Dakota want \nmore time off the amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Wisconsin for \nhis amendment. He offered the same amendment in the Budget Committee. I \nhave great respect for him as a friend and a colleague, but I would \nurge our colleagues to vote no on the amendment.\n  We have pay-go in the existing bill. We have pay-go basically for \nanything that is not in the assumption of the budget resolution. We \nassume $144 billion on the tax side. It may sound like a lot of money, \nbut over that 5-year period of time, we are talking about $12 trillion \nof revenue. The amount of money that we are saving is a very small \npercentage.\n  Now, why do we try to say, Well, you should not have to pay for that? \nBecause almost all of that, with the exception of a little AMT, is \npresent law.\n  We don't have pay-go if you have a lot of spending bills that sunset. \nWhen those are reauthorized, you do not say, Oh, now you have to have \npay-go. You have to raise taxes or cut spending to reauthorize the farm \nbill, for example.\n  As a matter of fact, I have found about $1 trillion worth of \nentitlements over the next several years that are sunset or due to \nsunset, but they don't have pay-go when they are extended. We have a \nlot of tax cuts that are sunset that, when they are extended, would \nhave to be paid for. So it really discriminates against taxes, makes it \nmuch more difficult to keep tax levels where they are today.\n  Some people say: Additional tax cuts. I say, no, keep taxes where \nthey are today. This is a much higher hurdle if you want to keep tax \nlevels where they are today. Adoption of this amendment is going to \nmake it a lot harder. It is going to make it a lot harder to continue \nto have the marriage penalty relief we are now assuming in our budget. \nThat is $900 for my in-laws, $900 for my kids, $900 for any couple in \nAmerica that makes $58,000. We are assuming we are going to continue \npresent law.\n  People say: We want pay-go. We want it to apply to spending and to \nentitlements. But when you look at the amendment, it doesn't apply to \nappropriated accounts. It doesn't apply to increases in appropriations \nfor a lot of different activities.\n  Someone might say: That is handled in the caps. Only if you pass a \nbudget. The idea is to pass pay-go that is going to extend for the next \nseveral years, I believe through 2009, regardless of whether you have a \nbudget. We may or may not have a budget. A lot of people predicted last \nyear we wouldn't have a budget. They predicted this year we wouldn't \nhave a budget. We proved them wrong last year, and I hope and expect we \nwill prove them wrong this year.\n\n[[Page S2512]]\n\n  Spending is not covered. Discretionary appropriations are not \ncovered. What is appropriated is not covered. Next year 820-some \nbillion will not be covered. You could have any kind of increase. As a \nmatter of fact, it almost is an incentive for increases in \nappropriations because that doesn't have to be paid for. But anything \nelse has to be paid for.\n  The tax cuts that expire or that have an expiration date--and we have \nhad to do that in the past for a variety of reasons--would have to be \npaid for. Spending programs don't have to be paid for.\n  I didn't hear our colleague saying we needed pay-go when we were \ndoing concurrent receipts for retired military personnel. That was \nabout $40 billion. I didn't hear people say, when we were doing the \nMedicare expansion, we need pay-go for that. That was $395 billion, as \nscored by CBO, and that is permanent. So the Medicare bill, which is \ngoing to grow dramatically over the next several years, can continue \ngrowing almost unchecked unless a future Congress curtails it in some \nway. And no pay-go, even if it is $300 billion the first 10 and maybe \n$1 trillion the next 10 or more, no pay-go for that.\n  So spending can increase rather dramatically. But if you want to \ncontinue having a 25-percent tax rate--and by the year 2010 it \nexpires--if you don't pay for it, that rate goes to 28 percent in the \nyear 2011. The difference between 28 and 25 doesn't sound like much. \nThat is 3 percent. That is over 10 percent. That is about a 15-percent \nincrease in an individual's tax rate. That means the marriage penalty \nrelief we just gave would disappear. That is $1,000. By that time, it \nwill be $1,000. Right now it is $911. We are trying to continue that.\n  Some people say: You want more tax cuts. That is not more tax cuts. \nThat is keeping present law. If we don't keep present law, extend \npresent law, it is going to be a tax increase on families.\n  What did we assume under our resolution? We assumed present law is \nextended. Above that, you have pay-go. That is what our resolution \nsays.\n  I urge our colleagues, think about this a little bit. Frankly, if you \nare going to have it, it really should apply to any entitlement program \nthat is sunset. That is not in this amendment. What we did in our bill \nis very similar to my colleague's amendment with the exception of we \nsay we should exempt those things that are covered in the budget. \nPrimarily that includes extending present law on the child credit, on \nthe 10-percent bracket, and on marriage penalty relief. We also \nincluded $23 billion for AMT relief, and we included $15 billion on the \nenergy bill. That is the bulk of what we have extended or what we \nassumed. Anything above that has to be paid for, entitlementwise or \ntaxwise.\n  Again, I congratulate my colleague from Wisconsin, but I urge our \ncolleagues, if they want to protect families and make sure the tax cuts \nhappen, to vote no on the amendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I appreciate not only the comments of \nthe Senator from Oklahoma but his leadership on the Budget Committee. I \nenjoy very much serving with him on the committee. I also appreciate \nthe sort of change of tone from the opposition on this amendment. \nEverything we have heard about this amendment recently is how we need \nto have a weaker rule than the pay-go rule. Somehow we have to justify \nthese exceptions that were put in the Budget Committee resolution. \nFinally the chairman is talking about what we really should be talking \nabout, that we need a strong rule.\n  What he has done is lay out some things our pay-go doesn't do. That \nis true. There may be some additional things we should do in this area. \nBut what I am proposing, with the cosponsors, is let's at least go back \nto the rules we know worked, the rules that brought this country a \nbalanced budget in the 1990s. They were proven to work. That is all \nthis amendment does.\n  If the Senator from Oklahoma wants to talk about additional steps, I \nam all for it. Senator Gregg and I, in the Budget Committee in the \npast, tried for 5-year caps on spending. We were defeated by a largely \nparty-line vote except for Senator Gregg. That didn't work so we tried \na 2-year cap, working with Senator Conrad. That was rejected. We tried \n1 year. That is one of the three legs of the stool, the discretionary \nspending. If the Senator wants to work with me and Senator Gregg and \nothers to propose legislation to deal with that, I am ready to go. In \nfact, Senator Gregg and I proposed such a bill.\n  But the chairman knows very well we can't change that on the budget \nresolution. We have to pass a statutory item in order to accomplish \nthat. So I am eager to do it.\n  Let's pass this pay-go amendment and let's immediately move on to \nfinish the job by passing the kind of statute that will achieve what \nthe Senator from Oklahoma is talking about.\n  I can't allow a complete changing of the subject because the truth is \nthe pay-go rules in the proposal before us are not pay-go. They are \npay-go minus. It is sort of as though you draft up a budget and after \nyou figure out what you want, then you draft up the rules by which you \nwill draft up the budget. That is the game we are playing here. We \ndon't go into the process saying: Look, we have played by these rules. \nThey have worked. We say: What do we need; what tax cuts do we want; \nwhat mandatory spending do we want. And after that, everything else \nthat hasn't gone through the barn door, then we make the rules apply \nafter that.\n  I suggest that doesn't work. I suggest it is a formula for more \nfiscal disaster. I suggest it means next year in the Budget Committee \nthe same thing is going to happen. There is going to be a whole list of \ntax cuts and other things--mandatory spending--people wanted to get in \nthere. And they will say: We exempt this, and now we will make the pay-\ngo rule apply.\n  That is making a sham out of the pay-go rules. The ranking member, \nfor whom I have enormous admiration on this subject, hit it right on \nthe head. The people of this country are beginning to realize it has \nall happened again, that they have been taken. We had rules in place \nthat the American people were thrilled to see work, leading to a \nbalanced budget and a surplus. Those rules are no longer there. Those \nrules were allowed to expire at a time when this country was undergoing \nenormous anxiety. But they are catching on. They caught on in 1992, and \nthey sent to Washington people who would deal with the deficit. They \nare catching on again now. The Senator is right, this vote is ``the \nvote'' about whether you are for balancing this Nation's budget or \nwhether you want deficits as far as the eye can see.\n  Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Delaware who has been a \nterrific advocate on this issue.\n  Mr. CARPER. I thank my colleague for yielding. I thank Senator \nFeingold and others on our side and the other side of the aisle for \ntheir work.\n  This is an important amendment. He is right. I don't know whether it \nis the most important amendment offered on this resolution, but it may \nwell be. I would like to take a couple of minutes and look back a few \nyears to some of the things that have been said by folks in our country \nand actually outside of our country.\n  I would like for us to go back to 2001, the first year George Bush \nwas President. What he said was:\n\n       We can proceed with tax relief without fear of budget \n     deficits.\n\n  We found out he was wrong.\n  A year or so later, he said:\n\n       Our budget will run a deficit that will be small and short \n     term.\n\n  I am sorry to say he was wrong again.\n  In 2003, he said:\n\n       Our current deficit is not large by historical standards \n     and is manageable.\n\n  That, too, is wrong.\n  This year, he is saying to us:\n\n       The deficit will be cut in half over the next 5 years.\n\n  Unfortunately, if we look more closely at what is going to happen \nover the next 5 years and beyond, the deficit may be trimmed a little \nbit, but it is going to begin to explode when my generation of baby \nboomers starts to retire in 5 or 6 years.\n  I want to share with my colleagues another quotation that occurred \nseveral years before these. It was not by an American but a fellow from \nGreat Britain, Dennis Healy. In the late 1970s, he was Chancellor of \nthe Exchequer. There was something he called the ``theory of holes.'' \nThe theory of holes\n\n[[Page S2513]]\n\ngoes something like this: When you find yourself in a hole, stop \ndigging.\n  We are in a hole. We are in a huge hole. The hole of debt is almost \n$7 trillion, up from about $1 trillion in 1982. It is actually pretty \nmodest compared to the hole we are going to be in in 2014. This red \nline represents money that we owe somebody. Those somebodies are going \nto want to be repaid. Do some of the people lending money to Uncle Sam \nlive in this country? A lot of them don't. A lot of them live around \nthe world. As they see this red ink accumulate, and as they see a \nnation not only living beyond its means financially through our Federal \ndeficits but a nation that buys a lot more from overseas than we \ncertainly sell to other countries, my fear is that what may well happen \nis those other countries will lend us so much money, but in order to \ncontinue to loan us more money, they are going to want a little higher \ninterest rate--maybe significantly higher--as our creditors. If we \nbegin to pay higher interest, we know what kind of adverse effect that \ncan have on the economy of this country.\n  Look at one other chart. This is about the year 1999, 2000, when the \nbudget deficits turned into surpluses. Now we are back in the soup. \nThis is what the deficit looks like. In 2004, it is about $600 billion. \nThe reason this looks higher than some of us are used to is because \nthis is the real operating deficit, when you take away the mask that is \nprovided by Social Security. Social Security is going into the surplus, \nand it makes the operating deficit look smaller because we operate \nunder a unified budget. After dropping down, it picks up to about \nthree-quarters of a trillion dollars. That is 1 year. It will be over a \nquarter of a trillion dollars in 2014.\n  A week or so ago Alan Greenspan was before the Banking Committee. He \nwas testifying. During the course of his testimony, and following his \ntestimony, we had the opportunity to ask him questions. I asked him \nquestions about the potential of interest rates rising and what that \nmight do to the economy. He expressed that could happen and, in fact, \nit would be a chilling one for the American economy.\n\n  We also talked about the proposal before us today that Senator \nFeingold is offering, this pay-as-you-go notion; the idea that if I \nwanted to raise spending further above the baseline of spending already \nbuilt into our budget, I would have to come up with an offset. The idea \nis that if I wanted to lower revenues, cut taxes in some area, I would \ncome up with an offset to equal out that effect.\n  I asked Chairman Greenspan--there are different approaches to pay-go. \nOne, I call it pay-go ``lite,'' where it would only affect the spending \nside. If I had a spending increase I wanted to make, I would have to \ncome up with the offset. I said, How about the other side of a pay-as-\nyou-go, on the revenue side? I was trying to get him on the record to \nsay that the pay-as-you-go should be applied both on the spending side \nand the revenue side.\n  This is what he said: What worked in the past is what we ought to do \nnow. That is what he said. What worked in the past is what you, the \nCongress, ought to do now. What worked in the past? It was a pay-as-\nyou-go approach that applied to both spending and revenues. Frankly, it \nworked real well in the past. It is not the only thing that worked \nwell, but it was helpful. We have the opportunity to put it back into \nplace. We ought to do it.\n  My dad, when I was a kid growing up, would say to my sister and me \nwhen we would do some foolish stunt and not show any forethought: Just \nuse some common sense. My guess is, if we were on the floor today and I \nasked Senator Feingold, or Senator Conrad, or the Presiding Officer, to \ngo back to your childhood and think about things your parents used to \nsay to you, you could all think of something they would say to you to \ntry to drum into your heads. My dad would say more times than I would \ncare to remember: Just use some common sense.\n  When we have an annual budget deficit that is approaching $600 \nbillion, when we have a national debt that is now at about $7 trillion, \nI think a good test of common sense is, when any Senator wants to raise \nspending to make this situation worse, or any Senator wants to cut the \nrevenue base to make this situation worse, we ought to say: How are you \ngoing to pay for it? If I don't have a good answer, we should not do \nwhat I want to do--either raising spending or cutting revenues. In my \ndad's words, that would be using common sense. We need some common \nsense. This amendment will provide that.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes remain.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator. I will take 2 minutes off the \nresolution so the Senator will retain his time.\n  My colleagues, this amendment matters. We have a lot of amendments \nthat are important but that, frankly, are not going to do much about \nour long-term fiscal condition. This amendment could make a real \ncontribution to getting these skyrocketing deficits under control. Why? \nBecause it says simply this: No new spending on the mandatory side, and \nthat is two-thirds of Federal spending; no new tax cuts that are not \npaid for, unless you can get a supermajority vote.\n  This is one of the key budget disciplines we had through the 1990s \nthat helped us save hundreds of billions of dollars on the deficit. \nThis is what helped us move from record deficits to record surpluses. \nThis budget discipline was allowed to lapse in 2002, despite our best \nefforts.\n  Senator Feingold and I made a last-ditch attempt to save these budget \ndisciplines and we got 59 votes. We needed 60. Look what has happened \nsince. Deficits have taken off like a scalded cat.\n  My colleagues, I think this vote is going to be evidence of whether \nsomebody is serious about fiscal discipline and restoring fiscal sanity \nor whether they just want red ink as far as the eye can see. Make no \nmistake, that is where we are headed. That is where we are headed under \nthe President's plan.\n  The President's plan adds $3 trillion to the national debt in the \nnext 5 years. The budget resolution is a little bit better; it adds \n$2.86 trillion to the national debt in the next 5 years. All of this is \nright before the baby boomers retire.\n  My colleagues, you cannot leave this Chamber calling yourself a \nfiscal conservative unless you vote for this amendment. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the amendment of the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I strongly support the amendment offered \nby my good friend from Wisconsin.\n  We are facing a dire financial situation. The projected deficit for \nthe current fiscal year is $521 billion--that's over half of a trillion \ndollars--the largest ever. That is why the Congress and the \nadministration must begin taking action this year, despite the fact \nthat it is an election year, to address this crisis. Our failure to \nstart making some of the tough decisions will land squarely on the \nbacks of our children and grandchildren, and their financial future \nwill be strapped with digging out of the holes that have been created \nby our actions and inactions.\n  The Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan testified recently before \nthe House Budget Committee about the seriousness of our rising budget \ndeficit and, more specifically, the impact the deficit is going to have \non our future economic stability. He very clearly warned about the \nconsequences of a lack of fiscal discipline, and called for new steps \nto restrain spending. The Chairman firmly supports reinstatement of the \npay-go rules as one such step.\n  According to a joint statement issued by the Committee for Economic \nDevelopment, the Concord Coalition, and the Center on Budget and Policy \nPriorities, ``without a change in current (fiscal) policies, the \nfederal government can expect to run a cumulative deficit of $5 \ntrillion over the next 10 years.''\n  These figures are shameful and frightening. Another astonishing part \nof this report states that, ``after the baby boom generation starts to \nretire in 2008, the combination of demographic pressures and rising \nhealth care costs will result in the costs of Medicare, Medicaid and \nSocial Security growing faster than the economy. We project that by the \ntime today's newborns reach 40 years of age, the cost of these three \nprograms as a percentage of the economy will more than\n\n[[Page S2514]]\n\ndouble--from 8.5 percent of the GDP to over 17 percent.''\n  The Congressional Budget Office, CBO, also has issued warnings about \nthe dangers that lie ahead if we continue to spend in this manner. \nAccording to a recent CBO report, due to rising health care costs and \nan aging population, ``spending on entitlement programs--especially \nMedicare, Medicaid and Social Security--will claim a sharply increasing \nshare of the nation's economic output over the coming decades.'' The \nreport went onto say that, ``unless taxation reaches levels that are \nunprecedented in the United States, current spending policies will \nprobably be financially unsustainable over the next 50 years. An ever-\ngrowing burden of federal debt held by the public would have a \ncorrosive . . . effect on the economy.'' Additionally, CBO has \nprojected a 10-year deficit of $4.4 trillion.\n  These are alarming figures. It is critical we take action to curtail \nfurther deficit spending.\n  In the 1990s, when we faced what we thought to be the worst fiscal \nsituation possible, we passed the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990, which \ninstituted a number of statutory deficit control rules, including the \npay-as-you-go, pay-go, requirements. The statutory pay-go rules were \nlargely responsible for imposing true financial discipline on the \nCongress when it came to mandatory spending programs and taxes. \nUnfortunately, those rules expired in 2002.\n  We have an opportunity today to show the American public that we are \nserious about digging out of the fiscal hole that faces our country by \nadopting this amendment to strengthen the Senate pay-go point of order. \nAlthough I wish we could reestablish the statutory pay-go rules, we \ncan't do that in the budget resolution since it is not a law. We can, \nhowever, tighten up our own Senate rules to make it more difficult to \npass legislation that increases the deficit.\n  I would like to bring my colleagues' attention one of today's \neditorials in the Washington Post, urging reinstatement of the pay-go \nrules. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the editorial be printed \nin the Record immediately following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to clarify that I firmly support \nthe three proposed tax extensions in the pending budget resolution. I \nfully expect that when tax legislation is considered by the Chamber in \nthe weeks ahead, it will include extensions of the marriage penalty tax \nelimination, the $1,000 child tax credit, and expanding the 10 percent \nincome tax bracket as called for in this resolution, and I will support \nsuch legislation. This amendment is not an amendment in opposition to \nthose provisions, but rather, an amendment to promote fiscal \nresponsibility and protect us from ourselves.\n  I urges my colleagues to support the amendment.\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 10, 2004]\n\n                        Rigging the Budget Rules\n\n       When it comes to matters of taxes and spending, members of \n     Congress are like would-be dieters who can't stop raiding the \n     refrigerator. Recognizing this weakness, lawmakers have \n     resorted in the past to budget rules that act much like a \n     lock on the fridge. During the 1990s, these rules set \n     ceilings on discretionary spending and required that any tax \n     cuts or spending increases in entitlement programs be matched \n     by offsetting spending cuts or tax increases. As with the \n     dieter who knows where the key is hidden, the rules didn't \n     work perfectly--they could be avoided with a 60-vote \n     majority--but they did help curb lawmakers' natural \n     tendencies.\n       The rules expired at the end of 2002, and everyone from \n     President Bush to Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan to \n     Clinton Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin has called for \n     their renewal. ``Perhaps the single most important act \n     Congress and the Administration could take at this point to \n     rein in the budget over the next decade would be to re-\n     establish the budget rules that existed in the 1990s,'' Mr. \n     Rubin wrote in a recent paper co-authored with the Brookings \n     Institution's Peter R. Orszag and Allen Sinai of Decision \n     Economics Inc.\n       But the Bush administration, and some of its allies in \n     Congress, would rig the rules to apply discipline in a \n     dangerously lopsided fashion. The administration proposes \n     strict controls on spending but no restraints at all on \n     cutting taxes, an approach influenced by the administration's \n     inflated view of the beneficial effect of tax cuts. But even \n     for those who fully subscribe to the administration's \n     position on the relative merits of taxes and spending, it's \n     clear that such a rule would simply skew budgetary choices, \n     resulting in spending programs recast in the guise of tax \n     breaks. Mr. Greenspan reiterated last month that the rule \n     ought to apply to both spending increases and tax cuts.\n       Meanwhile, the budget resolution before the Senate would \n     leave in place the sham version of pay-as-you-go adopted last \n     year, in which the rule applies only to tax cuts or spending \n     increases in excess of what the budget resolution provides. \n     This year's model would permit $122 billion more in tax cuts \n     not offset by savings elsewhere. Under this meaningless form \n     of pay-as-you-go, senators promise every year to show \n     spending discipline--the next time around.\n       An effort to add an evenhanded pay-as-you-go rule failed on \n     a party-line vote in the Senate Budget Committee last week. \n     The Senate should fix that omission before it approves \n     another irresponsible budget. And lawmakers should show \n     discipline by requiring themselves to pay for all their tax \n     cuts--not carving our popular middle-class breaks like the \n     child tax credit, and certainly not speeding up repeal of the \n     estate tax, for special budgetary treatment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I cannot tell you how pleased I am to \nhave the support of these two Senators. They are two Senators who are \nconsistently devoted to protecting the taxpayers in their State and in \nthe country. I find, more than anything else, people looking for \nrepresentatives who truly come out here and take the tough votes to \nprotect the interests of the taxpayers.\n  As I indicated before, they are figuring out that despite all the \ntroubles of the last couple of years, we have irresponsibly driven up \nthis country's deficit and debt to a point that is unprecedented in the \nhistory of the country.\n  I am grateful to these two Senators. I remind everybody, this is a \nbipartisan amendment. We have a Republican cosponsor, and there will be \nother Republican votes for it. This is not your typical partisan \namendment or vote on a budget resolution. This is about what used to be \na consensus in this body. We ought to have some rules that are \nconsistent that will apply to all parts of the budget so that we can \nwork together on behalf of the American people to do something about \nour very serious fiscal problems.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, how much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma has 24 minutes. The \nSenator from Wisconsin has 3 minutes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, to notify our colleagues, it will be my \nintention to yield some time back and to vote, unless my colleague from \nIowa wishes to speak, at quarter to 6. We have three rollcall votes. \nThe first one will be on Senator Byrd's amendment to strike the \nreconciliation provisions.\n  I notify my colleagues that rollcall votes will probably begin in the \nnext 10 minutes.\n  I have great respect for the authors of the amendment. I support pay-\ngo, but I think it should be pay-go with the present law tax cuts being \nextended. If we do not, we are going to have tax increases. We ought to \nlet people keep the same tax rates they have today. I do not want to \nlose the marriage penalty relief. That is what we are assuming in our \nbudget. This boils down to, we have pay-go on everything except these \nchild-friendly, marriage-friendly tax cuts. We want those to continue, \nmaybe not under pay-go.\n  Some people say let's raise somebody else's taxes to pay for them. \nThat is a recipe for getting nothing done. We want to continue present \nlaw on the taxes. It is very interesting that present law on spending \ndoes not have to be paid for. We have a lot of spending programs that \nalso have sunset provisions, but they do not have pay-go when they are \nreauthorized, when they are extended.\n  If you extend the farm bill--I have a whole list of programs--\nTemporary Assistance for Needy Families, food stamps, Commodity Credit \nCorporation, veterans compensation, child care entitlements, and State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program. All these, and many more, are \ntemporary. They sunset. When they are extended, they are assumed to be \nextended. They do not have to be paid for. But any tax cuts--when I say \ntax cuts, marriage penalty relief, child credit taxes, the rates that \nwe now have, 35 percent maximum, 10 percent--that 10 percent\n\n[[Page S2515]]\n\nis now going to revert to 15 percent unless we pay for it? Oh, that \nrate that is 25 percent today is going to go to 28 percent unless we \npay for it, but we do not make the appropriators pay for incremental \nexpense. They can increase appropriations by any amount. They do not \nhave to pay for it.\n\n  My point is we have basically identical pay-go under our resolution \nas this amendment provides, except we assume present law, I stated a \nwhile ago, with exception of AMT. AMT is basically an extension of \npresent law.\n  The resolution we have before us was well thought out. It says let's \nkeep present law intact, basically. Let's not have tax increases on \nfamilies. Let's not make it more difficult for people to keep present \nlaw. Let's not tax them more next year under some rule, the present \nlaw.\n  I know most of my colleagues do not want to increase taxes on those \nfamilies, so we put it in the budget. Anything above that has to be \npaid for. So we have pay-go. If somebody says it does not work, they \ndid not look at the Senate last year. I happened to be chairman of the \nBudget Committee. I requested somebody to make 60-some budget points of \norder, almost all of which we prevailed on. If anybody thinks I am not \nwilling to use pay-go or any other budget rule to try and constrain \nspending, I think the facts will show quite differently.\n  We will enforce the budget. The question is whether we are going to \nallow people to keep the same rates they have today or assume they are \ngoing to have a tax increase unless we find some other tax increase to \npay for it.\n  I urge our colleagues to vote against this amendment. I reserve the \nremainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I wish I could say what is in the budget \nresolution before us is pay-go, but it is not pay-go. It is pay-go \nwithout an absolutely critical component, and that is making it apply \nto the tax cuts. It is almost like saying I want pay-go as long as it \ndoes not apply to what I want, and that is not the pay-go that worked \nin the 1990s. That is not the pay-go that brought us a balanced budget.\n  I have to reiterate, this does not stop the tax cuts the Senator from \nOklahoma is talking about--child care credit, 10-percent bracket, \nmarriage penalty. Not only can all of these survive under pay-go, they \nwill. They just need to get 60 votes. I predict in each case, they will \nprobably get 35 to 40 extra votes on top of that, if anyone even raises \nthe point of order. So it is simply false to say somehow this stops the \ntax cuts from being extended.\n  Let's be honest about it. The only reason this exemption is needed is \nthose tax cuts were not made permanent. Had they been made permanent, \nthe Senator from Oklahoma would not have to be worrying about extending \nthem. Why weren't they made permanent? They weren't made permanent so \nwe could have this phony idea the deficit isn't as bad as it really is \nout in the future years. It is a gimmick. It is a game to make them \ntemporary so you can say it is not going to cost more in the outyears. \nThen when it comes time to face the music, what do we do? We say the \nnormal rules do not apply. We do not require ourselves to pay for it, \nor we do not require the 60 votes that are normally needed.\n  Without the adoption of this amendment, we have done serious damage \nto the integrity of the pay-go rules going into the future. A system of \nrules such as this depends on the integrity of the rules, that they be \napplied fairly and across the board. Allowing these exemptions, even \nwell-intentioned, with regard to certain tax cuts, undermines the \nintegrity of a system we all relied on to work in the 1990s.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma has 20 minutes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield my colleague from Iowa such time as he desires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am going to oppose this amendment \nbecause this amendment is not about paying for tax cuts; it is about \navoiding a tax increase. Although I understand the desire to impose \npay-go, it should not apply to current law, and that is a very \nimportant distinction.\n  Under current law, we have a number of tax provisions, including the \nexpanded 10-percent tax bracket, the $1,000-per-child tax credit, and \nmarriage penalty relief that will expire at the end of this year. If we \ndo not extend these provisions, taxes will go up, and taxes will go up \nautomatically.\n  As I have said before in several other points I have been making on \nother amendments, it is one thing for Congress to have guts enough to \nvote a tax increase, but it is quite another to let taxes go up \nautomatically without a vote of the people. I think that is wrong.\n  In order to extend the existing tax law, we need to pass legislation \nyet this year if we are going to have a seamless continuation of \npresent tax law into the year 2005 and beyond. That is what this \namendment is all about. We are going to either extend current law or we \nare going to let taxes go up.\n  Requiring the Senate to pay for this tax relief we already have in \nthe law, that would not be in the law if we do not take some action \nthis year, could lead to disastrous results. We are talking about \ndisastrous results for families, such as if one is married and they get \nhit with the marriage penalty, that is a major concern to those \nfamilies who have to pay more. If they have children and they benefit \nfrom the $1,000 child credit and that credit goes down, that is going \nto hit those families to a greater extent.\n  All families, low income or otherwise, but particularly this 10-\npercent bracket was put in the law to help low-income Americans pay \nless taxes. So it is a disastrous result on families, and we should not \nhave to go to the extra extreme of maintaining existing law. If for \nsome reason we could not agree on the necessary offsets that would be \nrequired under Senator Feingold's amendment, or if we could not get 60 \nvotes, then current law would expire and taxes would automatically go \nup, without even any consideration by any of us. There would be 535 \npeople just standing by and letting taxes go up.\n  Some people may be willing to take that risk, but I do not believe \nthat is the right approach. Consequently, we need to reject this \namendment. We need to support working families of America by extending \nthe tax reductions that have already been provided for under current \nlaw. We need that to be seamless. We do not want to take any chance \nsomehow somebody is going to say next October, just before we adjourn \nfor the election, well, we will worry about this next year. That is a \nbad situation to leave the families of America. They ought to know what \ntax policy is for the long haul.\n  Certainty of tax policy is the best tax policy. Even if it might not \nbe exactly the right tax policy, certainty of tax policy is better than \nthe uncertain situation we have facing American working men and women \ntoday.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I will be shortly yielding back the \nremainder of our time. I believe our agreement was we would go to the \nByrd amendment first. I think we agreed to have 1 minute on each side \nto recap the debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I have already asked Senator Byrd to come in. Has the \nSenator from Wisconsin concluded?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I want to know, do I have 30 seconds \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Let me point out to the Senator from Iowa, for whom I \nalso have enormous regard and really enjoy working with, he indicated \nhe wanted to make sure this pay-go goes through the way they have it in \nthe budget resolution in order to make sure tax cuts that are current \nlaw continue. The fact is they are not in current law. The current law \nsays they shall expire. That is the law. The law is they are going to \nexpire.\n  In order to continue these tax cuts, a new law must be passed. All I \nam saying is the pay-go rule should apply to that new law, to those new \ntax cuts, because otherwise we are not applying the rules that are \napplied to everything\n\n[[Page S2516]]\n\nelse. I think it is an important distinction.\n  It is not by accident these were set up to expire.\n  They would have been in violation of the budget because they caused \ndeficits in the outgoing years.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, my colleague from Wisconsin is correct, \nthese tax changes we made last year expire at the end of this year. \nActually, I think they have been in effect for 2 years. If we do not \nextend them, it is going to be a tax increase on American families. We \nare trying to protect American families.\n  I heard my colleague from Wisconsin say we want to protect taxpayers. \nThat is exactly what we are trying to do. We are basically saying over \n$13 trillion in spending and about $12 trillion in revenues. The only \nthing we are trying to protect over the next 5 years is $144 billion. \nThat is basically extending present law to make sure people do not have \na tax increase from what their tax rates are today. Above that, we have \npay-go. That is basically what our resolution says, with the exception \nof the energy bill, and perhaps one other minor provision; AMT is an \nextension of present law.\n  We do not want the families who are paying taxes today to have a big \ntax increase, if they have 4 kids, of $2,200 next year. So we said \neverything else, yes, is pay-go. We do not have pay-go for the farm \nbill. We do not have pay-go for all of these multitude of entitlement \nprograms I mentioned. They all sunset. They all expire at a certain \nperiod of time. There are some real inequities, almost a bias, for more \nspending. We do not have pay-go for incremental increases in \ndiscretionary spending, but we say, oh, if you want to keep your \npresent tax level, you have to pay for it.\n  What some people mean by that is we want to have higher taxes on \nsomebody else. The net result could be, especially in a political year, \none where the partisan feelings are so strong you would end up with no \ntax bill, which ends up increasing taxes on American families. I do not \nwant that to happen.\n\n  If we look at the total amount of money spent, the difference is $144 \nbillion. We are saying we want to apply pay-go above everything else. \nWhen talking about $13 trillion, it is not that significant. I think it \nis important to protect the $144 billion, so we protect American \nfamilies so they do not have a tax increase next year.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. On our side, it is my understanding Senator Levin has 5 \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. NICKLES. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. I ask Senator Feingold have 1 minute of that 5 minutes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. We could go back and forth all day. I would like to \nstart the rollcall vote very quickly. If Senator Levin is in the \nChamber, this would be the time for him to speak.\n  Mr. REID. He is not going to use his time.\n  Mr. NICKLES. If Senator Feingold wants an additional minute, that \nwill be fine. I will take an additional minute.\n  Mr. REID. I will yield back the 4 minutes when he finishes his time.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I would be happy to grant Senator Feingold an additional \nminute. I will take an additional minute and then we will hear from \nSenator Byrd and we will vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to debate \nthe Senator from Oklahoma. I join with him on the issue when it comes \nto the taxpayers. The lesson we learned in the 1990s is the worst thing \nthat can be done to the taxpayers of this country is to run record \ndeficits and destroy the fiscal integrity of this country.\n  The only question is: Are we going to have across-the-board, tough \nbudget rules to protect the taxpayer dollars, or are we going to have \nholes in those rules that will make sure the taxpayers get in a deeper \nhole with the deficits?\n  Those tax cuts will not be denied because of these rules this year. \nThe taxpayers of this country will get the 10 percent. They will get \nthe continued elimination of the marriage penalty. They will get the \nchild care credit. If we go with my amendment, they will get that and \nalso get the fiscal discipline rules that brought them a balanced \nbudget at the end of the 1990s.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic whip.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, would the distinguished manager of the bill \nentertain having the second 2 votes 10-minute votes rather than 15-\nminute votes?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I was going to make that request.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time. What we agreed to do \npreviously was to stack the three votes. Senator Byrd would be first. \nWe agreed to have the proponents and opponents each have a minute \nbefore each vote. I ask unanimous consent that we vote on Senator \nByrd's amendment and that the following two votes be limited to 10 \nminutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I wanted to \ninquire if I might find a way to speak for not to exceed 2 minutes in \nopposition to the amendment that is offered by Senators Warner and \nStevens.\n  Mr. REID. I have no problem with that.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I modify my request so that there be 2 minutes on each \nside prior to the vote on the amendment of Senator Warner and Senator \nStevens.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have not been ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I ask for the yeas and nays for the Byrd amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I believe our regular order would be we \nwould revert to the Byrd amendment with 1 minute debate on each side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct. Is the Senator yielding back \nhis time on the Feingold amendment?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield the remainder of my time on the Feingold \namendment.\n  Mr. REID. I yield Senator Levin's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection to the request of the \nSenator that the yeas and nays be ordered?\n  Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2735\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized \nfor 1 minute.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the debate about budget deficits is taking \nplace all across this country. Ironically, the one place where debate \nis discouraged on this matter is right here in the world's greatest \ndeliberative body. My amendment would strike the tax reconciliation \ninstructions to the Finance Committee that would shield tax cut \nlegislation that worsens the deficit from a thorough debate in the \nSenate.\n  To use reconciliation to increase the deficit is an abuse of the \nbudget process. It doesn't matter whether it is an $81 billion tax cut, \na $350 billion tax cut, or a $1.35 trillion tax cut, the Budget Act \nframers--and I was one of them--did not contemplate all this \ndifficulty, did not contemplate reconciliation would ever be used to \nworsen the deficit. Not until 1999, after 25 years of restraint, was \nthis abuse of the process first perpetrated.\n  If this budget resolution passes with these reconciliation \ninstructions included, the Senate will be denied the opportunity to \nforge a consensus that would allow it to extend these tax cuts and pay \nfor them.\n  That is the issue on which we vote today. A vote to strike the \nreconciliation instructions is a vote to allow the Senate to work its \nwill and to permit the further worsening of the deficit. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the amendment, and I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I alert my colleagues we are going to start 3 rollcall \nvotes momentarily.\n\n[[Page S2517]]\n\n  The only way to make sure there is not a tax increase on American \nfamilies is to pass reconciliation. Maybe we don't need it. I hope we \ndon't need it. Maybe we will have some good bipartisan cooperation and \nwe can extend present law to make sure these families don't have a tax \nincrease, but this is a pretty partisan time. We can't even get \nconferees appointed to the Workforce Reinvestment Act, which would help \npeople to get jobs. Some people are just playing games. I don't want to \nplay games with the American family. We only reconcile $81 billion out \nof $12 trillion.\n\n  I want families to have a tax cut. I want them to keep the same tax \nlaw they have today. That is a savings of $1,600 for a family of four \nthat has taxable income of $58,000. The only way we can really assure \nthat is going to happen, or increase the likelihood that will happen, \nwill be to have reconciliation. I wish that wasn't necessary, but \nunfortunately it is. You can have a lot of people play games with the \ntax bill if it comes through and it has unlimited amendments.\n  Maybe we won't need reconciliation. Chairman Grassley asked me to \nmake sure we have it as an option, and I think it is important to do \nso. If we don't, you may well see the $1,000 tax credit per child go to \n$700, you may well see the marriage penalty relief disappear and \nincrease taxes on couples $900. I urge our colleagues to vote no on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. \nThe yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from South Dakota (Mr. Johnson) \nis necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). Are there any other Senators \nin the Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 47, nays 52, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 36 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--47\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham (FL)\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--52\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham (SC)\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Johnson\n       \n  The amendment (No. 2735) was rejected.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2742\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are now 4 minutes evenly divided prior \nto a vote on the Warner amendment.\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, of the 2 minutes under my control, I would \nlike to give a minute to my distinguished colleague, Senator Stevens.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the amendment I have cosponsored with \nSenator Warner will restore the President's request for the Department \nof Defense. I understand the reasons why the Budget Committee did not \nbring this full number out of the committee, but we wish to restore the \nPresident's request in full.\n  We are engaged in a global war against terrorism. We have troops in \nAfghanistan, Iraq, and Haiti. More than half of our forces are overseas \nat the present time. I do not think it is time for us to cut the \nPresident's request for the Department of Defense.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I will be happy to follow with the \nremainder of my time, if the other side wishes to address this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, on this side we urge our colleagues to \nsupport this amendment. We think when our forces are in the field, when \nthey are in combat half a world away, we ought to meet the Commander in \nChief's request for funding.\n  We will offer an amendment at a later point in the queue to fully pay \nfor this amendment. We think that is an appropriate way to handle this \nmatter. But for the moment, on this amendment, we think the right vote \nis to support the request of the Commander in Chief while our forces \nare in combat.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes in opposition.\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have the utmost respect for the two \nauthors of this amendment. They know that.\n  The Defense Department is plagued with accounting problems so severe \nthat the Secretary of Defense cannot account for billions of taxpayer \ndollars. The General Accounting Office estimates the very earliest the \nDefense Department could possibly pass an audit would be 2007, and that \nis optimistic. The administration does not even know how much time and \nhow much money it will take to fix the accounting problems.\n  It is absurd that the administration is proposing to cut vital \ndomestic investments while billions and billions of dollars are lost \nevery year in the Pentagon's broken accounting system. Such waste would \nnot be tolerated from any other Department.\n  I suggest the Pentagon would be more careful with its money if it had \nless of it to waste. The Defense Department's budget is already bloated \nat $414 billion. I cannot support this amendment to add another $6.9 \nbillion to the budget resolution for the Pentagon when it cannot \nexplain to the American taxpayers how their hard-earned money is being \nspent.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I say to my distinguished colleague in \nreply that you have brought this to the attention of the Senate year \nafter year, as you should.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. WARNER. We are endeavoring, through oversight and otherwise, to \ncorrect it. But those problems in no way are owing to the valor of the \nmen and women in uniform and their families.\n  Mr. BYRD.

There will now be 2 minutes of debate, evenly \ndivided, prior to a vote on the Feingold amendment.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this amendment will simply return us to \nthe rules by which Congress played in the decade of the 1990s. We \neliminate the exceptions to pay-go included in last year's resolution \nthat exempt new tax cuts and new mandatory spending included in the \nbudget resolution, an exception that facilitates more damage to the \nFederal bottom line.\n  This amendment will not--I repeat, will not--prevent the extension of \nthe expiring 10-percent bracket or the child tax credit or the marriage \npenalty. This body will vote to extend those tax cuts by a huge margin, \nand I will be part of that huge margin. But this amendment will return \nsome of the budget discipline that helped us balance the budget.\n  Deficits matter. Debt matters. Let's not leave our children and \ngrandchildren with an even bigger tab than we have already stuck them \nwith.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I urge our colleagues to vote no on this \namendment. These are the tax cuts we are trying to protect. Everything, \nbasically other than that with a minor couple other things, is pay-go. \nWe have pay-go on everything that is not assumed in the budget. This \nchart shows most of it. That is tax relief for American families.\n  We should protect taxpayers. We do not have pay-go for expansion of \nentitlements that sunset, but we do for tax cuts that are sunset. That \nis not fair to the taxpayers. Let us protect taxpayers.\n  We have pay-go in the underlying resolution. Last year, I and others \nmade 62 points of order to cut spending. We used pay-go. We will use it \nagain this year. We have it in this budget resolution. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote no on the Feingold amendment.\n  For the information of colleagues, we expect to have about a 2-hour \nwindow, and we expect to have more rollcall votes probably beginning \nabout 8:45 or 9 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, for the information of our colleagues, \nSenator Conrad and I are trying to work out an agreement on which \namendments will be going next. I believe we have an understanding that \nSenator Baucus will offer an amendment. At that point, Senator \nVoinovich will offer an amendment, and I think I will stop there. I \nknow Senator Conrad is trying to line up one or two more.\n  It is our hope that people would not want too much time on their \namendments so we could expedite as many amendments as possible.\n  Again I will repeat, we expect votes to occur probably shortly before \n9.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2751\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I have an amendment at the desk and I ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Montana [Mr. Baucus] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2751.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To strike the outlay reconciliation instruction to the \n                         Committee on Finance)\n\n       Strike section 201(c).\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this amendment would eliminate the \nreconciliation instruction in the budget resolution directing the \nFinance Committee to produce savings in mandatory programs within the \ncommittee's jurisdiction. The amendment is based on an assumption in \nthe resolution that our committee would cut Medicaid by $11 billion \nover 5 years, and reduce earned-income tax credit outlays by $3 \nbillion.\n  Let me begin by clearing up one common misconception. Some may think \nthe budget calls for the Finance Committee to produce legislation that \nsaves $3.4 billion over 5 years, since that is the figure in the \nreconciliation instruction. In fact, the Finance Committee would have \nto produce $21.6 billion in savings. Why? Because the budget resolution \ncalls for extending the child tax credit and marriage penalty relief. \nSince a portion of the child tax credit and marriage penalty relief\n\n[[Page S2519]]\n\nis refundable, these count as outlays in the budget process. So \nextending the child tax credit and marriage penalty relief, as the \nPresident has proposed and as the budget resolution provides, and which \nI support and I think the vast majority of Members of this body \nsupport, it will have the effect of increasing outlays also by $18.2 \nbillion over 5 years.\n  To produce legislation that generates net outlay reductions of $3.4 \nbillion, and the additional $8.2 billion cost, the Finance Committee \nwould have to draft legislation to reduce spending by $21.6 billion--\nagain, not the $3.4 billion over 5 years, which is the figure in the \nbudget resolution. It would actually have to be $21.6 billion.\n  The budget resolution assumes the Finance Committee will pass \nlegislation that cuts Medicaid by $11 billion and cuts the earned-\nincome tax credit by $3 billion and comes up with the remaining $7.6 \nbillion by extending customs user fees.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator withhold for one moment? I apologize.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Absolutely.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. Chairman, would you like to present a unanimous \nconsent request on time agreements on the next four amendments?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, we have three or four amendments in the \nqueue. I believe they are the amendment of Senator Baucus, the \namendment of Senator Voinovich, the amendment of Senator Nelson, and \nthe amendment of Senator Corzine.\n  I ask unanimous consent there be 30 minutes equally divided on each \nof those four amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Reserving the right to object, can I get in that queue?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I reserve the right to object, too.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Can I get on that queue?\n  Mr. NICKLES. You would have to talk to your manager.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I will be happy to make that the fifth amendment.\n  Mr. NICKLES. What amendment would that be?\n  Mr. CONRAD. The firefighters amendment.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I am not familiar with the amendment. I would like to \nsee it. I expect I would agree to it.\n  Mr. CONRAD. It is the amendment offered in the committee. I would say \nwhat we would like to accomplish. The next round of votes has been set \nfor 8:45 or 9 o'clock. We would like to get the next group of \namendments debated so they could be voted on at that time. That is why \nwe are trying to have very tight time limits on these amendments. Would \nthat be agreeable to the Senator?\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, actually it is not agreeable. I would like \nan hour. I may not use it all, but I would like an hour, equally \ndivided.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Equally divided. I ask the chairman, could we say we have \nan hour equally divided on that amendment and 30 minutes on the other \nthree, equally divided, and reach that agreement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will modify the request that there be an hour equally \ndivided on the Baucus amendment and the other three amendments I \nreferred to be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SARBANES. I object. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Senator from Montana \nhas the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, let me just recap briefly so Senators \nunderstand my amendment. I explained where we were before the break in \nthe action.\n  I am offering an amendment which would eliminate the reconciliation \ninstruction to the budget resolution directing the Finance Committee to \nproduce savings in mandatory programs within the Finance Committee's \njurisdiction. The amendment, as I mentioned earlier, is based on the \nassumption in the resolution that the committee would cut Medicaid by \n$11 billion over 5 years and reduce the earned-income tax credit \noutlays by $3 billion.\n  Some may think the budget calls for the Finance Committee to produce \nlegislation that saves $3.4 billion over 5 years, since that is the \nfigure in the reconciliation. Actually, the committee would have to \nproduce savings of $21.6 billion, and that is basically because the \nresolution calls for extending the child tax credit and the marriage \npenalty relief, as the President has proposed, and as provided for in \nthe budget resolution and which I support. I think the vast majority of \nthe Members here support it.\n  As a consequence of all that, the outlays have to be increased $18.2 \nbillion over 5 years, and that is, again, because the earned-income tax \ncredit is refundable. So you add it all together and it actually comes \nup to $21.6 billion that has to be cut, not the figure of $3.4 billion \ncontained in the budget resolution.\n  I might add that I think neither the earned-income tax credit cuts \nnor the Medicaid cuts make a lot of sense. Let me start with the \nearned-income tax credit. That is a feature in the Tax Code that \nPresident Reagan once hailed as--and let me give his quote:\n\n       . . . the best anti-poverty, the best pro-family, the best \n     yet creative measure to come out of Congress.\n\n  I think he is right. The earned-income tax credit has done a lot to \nlift people out of poverty.\n  President Bush has not proposed any reductions in the earned-income \ntax credit, and with good reason. The earned-income tax credit was \ncreated in 1975 as a bipartisan effort to reduce the tax burden on low-\nincome Americans. It provides a powerful incentive for people to work. \nIt has played a very large role in moving poor families from welfare to \nwork. It has reduced poverty.\n\n  Nearly 4.8 million people, including 2.6 million children, are lifted \nout of poverty each year because of the EITC. By all accounts, the \nearned-income tax credit has been successful, and it has been \neffective.\n  While the earned-income tax credit has achieved its policy aims, and \nI might add with incredible success, a 1999 Treasury audit of EITC \nreturns shows that noncompliance is a problem. And it is a problem. \nNoncompliance in the EITC has been a problem. I believe, however, that \nnoncompliance on the earned-income tax credit is largely due to errors, \nnot because of fraud. Both the complexity of the tax credit and the \ncomplex living situations are responsible for the high error rate.\n  Let me give an example. There is an IRS publication called \npublication 596. That is the IRS instructions and forms for the earned-\nincome tax credit. Guess what. It is 52 pages long. Can you imagine \nsomebody sitting down at his or her kitchen table trying to figure out \nthe earned-income tax credit? The IRS takes more pages to explain the \nearned-income tax credit than it does to explain the complicated \nalternative minimum tax. Guess how many pages are in that. Eight. They \nare eight terrible pages, but there are only eight of them. The EITC \nbooklet has 52 pages. Obviously, it is unnecessary complexity.\n  Senator Grassley and I fashioned a series of reforms that were \nenacted as part of the 2001 tax cut legislation. The Treasury expects \nthose changes alone will reduce earned-income tax credit overpayments \nby about $2 billion a year. So we are doing something about it. We all \nrecognize more needs to be done, and we will all work together to see \nthat this work gets done.\n  But the remaining work is administrative; it is not legislative. As \nthis administration has indicated, finding ways to identify earned-\nincome tax filers who were not compliant, and to save money by \npreventing losses to the Treasury, is primarily an administrative \nissue, not one that can be achieved through legislation. One can't \nsimply wave a wand and pass a law mandating a lower error rate. That \ntakes a lot of administrative work. The IRS and Treasury are working on \nit now. They are conducting a major pilot project to test new \nprocedures which the agency hopes will reduce overpayments. I hope the \nTreasury reduces overpayments, and the IRS is also likely to conduct a \nsecond pilot this summer. I and other Senators want to see whether \nthese procedures work, while making sure\n\n[[Page S2520]]\n\nthey don't cause honest, eligible working families to lose earned-\nincome tax payments for which they qualify.\n  But I believe administrative action is the proper course. Let me \nreiterate that no legislative remedies are at hand that the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation has found will generate significant savings--no \nlegislation. Reducing errors is primarily administrative, and the \nbudget resolution's reconciliation instructions to the Finance \nCommittee would unfortunately force the committee to cut the EITC \nitself. It doesn't really address the error rate.\n  For hard-working, low-income families, the EITC offsets income, \npayroll, or Federal excise taxes. It would thus raise taxes for these \nworking families; that is, if the EITC were cut.\n  It is bad enough we continue to let the minimum wage erode. We should \nnot be raising the taxes on the working poor on top of that by cutting \nthe EITC. The Senate should take a firm stand against raising taxes on \nworking Americans.\n  The chairman's mark in the Budget Committee last week lays out two \nways to achieve these so-called EITC savings. One way is a tax \nincrease, pure and simple. The other way is administratively infeasible \nand would generate strong opposition from small business owners. The \nonly way the second method could be designed so it would save money \nwould be to make it, too, into a tax increase. Let me explain.\n  The first of two options in the chairman's mark is to repeal the EITC \nfor very poor workers, particularly workers without children. According \nto the IRS, some 3.7 million low-income workers received this credit in \nthe year 2003 and secured an average tax credit of a little over $200 \neach. These workers are among the poorest, lowest paid workers in the \ncountry. Only single workers with incomes below $11,490, and married \ncouples with incomes below $12,490, would even qualify.\n  This credit equals a maximum of 7.65 percent of the first $5,000 in \nwages these workers earn. As a result, this credit simply offsets some \nor all of the employee share of the payroll taxes these workers pay. \nRepeal it and the net Federal tax burden on these workers rises.\n  Furthermore, if this tax credit is repealed, poor, single workers \nwill begin owing Federal income tax in addition to their payroll taxes \nwhen their earnings only reach $7,950. That is nearly $2,000 below the \npoverty line. We can't do that. Such a change would literally tax these \nlow-paid workers deeper into poverty.\n  The other option the chairman's mark lists for achieving these EITC \nsavings is to require workers to get their EITC payments in their \npaychecks rather than in the refund when they file their tax returns at \nthe end of the year. This is unworkable.\n  First, some small employers will find it very difficult to do. They \nwould have to have additional complexity to do it. Second, many workers \nwill not want to do this because they believe their earnings or their \nspouse's earnings may rise during the year which would make them \neligible for a smaller EITC or no EITC at all, and if they received \nEITC payments during the part of the year their family's income was \nlower, they would have to write the IRS a check paying back the EITC \nwhen they file their tax returns. Not everyone in this situation is \nlikely to file a separate amended tax return or have the cash to pay \nthe EITC back. As a result, this could actually increase errors. It \ncould increase overpayments as well as causing many families \nconsiderable difficulty.\n  It would not save money. Suppose you instituted this system starting \nin the tax year 2005. It means next year low-income workers would \nreceive both their EITC tax refund for the tax year 2004 and their EITC \npayments for tax year 2005 which would be provided in their paychecks \nthroughout the year. The result would be the earned-income tax credit \ncosts would nearly double in 2005. That would increase costs, not \nreduce them.\n  This is not the time to cut Medicaid. Medicaid provides a crucial \nhealth care lifeline to more than 50 million Americans. It is a \ncritical player in our health care safety net. Medicaid pays for about \n40 percent of all births in this country. It pays for almost half of \nall nursing home days. Its reach stretches throughout the health care \nsystem, and substantial costs will be felt in every corner of this \nNation if this cut were to proceed.\n\n  Even without these proposed cuts, Medicaid beneficiaries and \nproviders are facing a very difficult year. Many States have not yet \nemerged from their worst financial crisis in several decades, and \nMedicaid programs have been cut in virtually every State in the past 2 \nyears. In fact, over the past 2 years, States have instituted Medicaid \nchanges that have resulted in between 1.2 million to 1.6 million low-\nincome children, parents, elderly, and disabled people losing coverage \nand becoming uninsured.\n  Benefits and provider payments have also been cut, resulting in \nbeneficiaries' reduced access to needed services and greater cost \nshifting to individuals who are insured. The liability of our health \ncare safety net is threatened. These cuts would have been significantly \nsteeper had Congress not provided States with $20 billion in fiscal \nrelief last year.\n  Even after these Medicaid cuts and other budget cuts--and in many \nStates tax increases--States still face a new round of deficits \nestimated at $40 billion in the coming year. Despite this news, the \nFederal fiscal relief is ending with the result that deeper Medicaid \ncuts are likely. The last thing we need to do now is to reduce Federal \nfunding for Medicaid further and force deeper cuts in Medicaid.\n  We should instead heed the bipartisan warnings of the National \nGovernors Association. In a letter last week, the National Governors \nAssociation chair and vice chair, Governor Kempthorne of Idaho and \nGovernor Warner of Virginia, had this to say:\n\n       States are currently emerging from the most severe budget \n     crisis since World War II. And nearly every State has enacted \n     difficult cuts to its Medicaid program, including both \n     eligibility levels and provider payments. Federal funding \n     reductions would force States to implement even deeper cuts \n     by restricting eligibility, eliminating or reducing critical \n     health benefits, and cutting or freezing provider \n     reimbursement rates. As a result, the Medicaid funding cuts \n     could add millions more to the ranks of the uninsured and \n     would harm our Nation's health care safety net.\n\n  We should listen to the Governors. They are bipartisan. This is not a \nbipartisan issue.\n  Opposition to the cuts extends beyond the Governors to hundreds of \norganizations of hospitals, doctors, nurses, veterans, disability \nadvocates, patients' advocates, and nursing homes.\n  Some have argued the savings could come--harmlessly, they seem to \nsuggest--by merely cutting ``fraud and abuse,'' particularly in State \nfinancing arrangements. But this is a false premise. Not one, not the \nadministration and not the chairman of the Budget Committee--not one--\nhas proposed a policy to limit State financing arrangements they decry. \nThe administration's exhortations on this matter are so vague the \nCongressional Budget Office has not scored the administration's \nproposal as producing any savings in Medicaid. No one has even claimed \nany specific proposals could raise $11 billion as essentially called \nfor in this reconciliation instruction.\n  To be clear, Congress has addressed the fraud we hear about.\n  The Finance Committee takes very seriously its oversight of the \nprograms within its jurisdiction. The committee is dedicated to \nmaintaining program integrity and ensuring taxpayer dollars are used \nwisely and efficiently. I am as strongly opposed to fraud as any \nSenator. But mandatory budget cuts are a blunt instrument unsuited to \naddress this difficult, complex problem, particularly in the absence of \nspecific administration proposals the Congressional Budget Office \nscores as producing savings.\n  Some have argued this budget reconciliation instruction doesn't \nmatter. They argue if the Finance Committee does not want to make these \ncuts, then it can simply not act.\n  But I ask, What if the House committees of jurisdiction do act? If \nthe House passes a reconciliation bill, any single Senator could then \nuse rule XIV to put that bill on the calendar, bypassing the Finance \nCommittee. The Senate could then be facing a fast-track vehicle to make \nunfair spending cuts that fall in the Finance Committee's jurisdiction \nwithout the committee ever having participated in the effort.\n  I have high confidence in the chairman of the committee, Senator \nGrassley of Iowa. He will find a good way to\n\n[[Page S2521]]\n\ndeal with Medicaid and with Medicare. He is very fair. He works with \nall Senators. I think that is by far the preferable procedure rather \nthan the fast-track procedure as I mentioned under rule XIV which \nbypasses the committee. It could well happen, if the House acts.\n  Finally, I note the House budget is likely to reconcile much deeper \ncuts in these programs while acting as though all such savings can \nsomehow be achieved by wishing away ``fraud, waste, and abuse.'' I am \ndeeply concerned about conference deliberations on this matter.\n  This reconciliation instruction is a very dangerous provision. It is \none that could do real damage. My amendment to strike this \nreconciliation instruction enjoys widespread support from many \nGovernors, many health care providers, and organizations dedicated to \nhelping the Nation's children, among countless others.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the amendment.\n  I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Hawaii to also speak on this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise to support an amendment offered by \nmy colleague from Montana, Senator Baucus, the ranking member of the \nFinance Committee. His amendment seeks to right wrongs perpetuated \nagainst low-income families in the budget resolution before us. As he \nhas explained, the pending resolution seeks to make room for further \ntax cuts by instructing the Finance Committee to make ill-advised cuts \nof $21.6 billion from Medicaid and the earned-income tax credit, EITC.\n  I am already concerned about the reconciliation instructions in the \nresolution that would further reduce federal revenues by $80.6 billion \nfor tax cut extensions that we cannot afford. We have felt in the \ncurrent fiscal year the negative effects of these tax cuts on important \ndomestic programs starved for resources, while we continue to put \nessential support toward our operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and the \nglobal war on terror. I strongly support our men and women in the \nmilitary who are fighting to preserve our security, and we must not \nerode further resources from them or the people they are protecting at \nhome by extending tax breaks or making them permanent. Although fully \noffset relief to lower income families through measures such as the \nrefundable child credit are seductive assumptions under this \ninstruction, I understand that further assumptions in the resolution \nwould allow an earlier repeal of the estate tax in 2009 instead of 2010 \nand permanency in other areas such as the dividends and capital gains \nrate structures at a cost of $22.7 billion. Now is simply not the time \nfor such measures.\n  With due respect to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, \nwhile we are seeing small promising signs in the economy, my colleagues \nseem willing to deny the ability of lower income families to help drive \neconomic recovery by raising their taxes. The resolution would partly \nfund tax cut extensions and permanency on the backs of the working poor \nwith attacks on Medicaid and the earned-income tax credit, EITC. These \nare simply mean-spirited actions against working families in this \ncountry.\n  The budget resolution would increase the number of underinsured and \nuninsured in this country by cutting more than $11 billion from \nMedicaid. The impact that this would have on already strained state \nMedicaid programs and the individuals who rely on this important safety \nnet would be devastating. States continue to face crisis situations \nwith respect to their budgets. We all know that Medicaid makes up a \ntremendous portion of state budgets, and drastic cuts by states to \nbalance their budgets have swelled the rolls of those without \ninsurance. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities reports that \nstate cuts over the past 2 years have shut between 1.2 million and 1.6 \nmillion people out of the Medicaid Program.\n  Additionally, the reductions in Medicaid included in the budget \nresolution will lead to further cuts in coverage and benefits for \npeople in need. They will prevent individuals from being able to access \nhealth care, which will increase the burden on our public health \nsystem. The uninsured delay seeking medical treatment, which is likely \nto lead to more significant and costly problems later on than if they \nhad sought earlier, preventative treatment or had access to proper \ndisease management. These cuts will also further erode the ability of \nthe hospitals, physicians, and other medical providers in our \ncommunities to meet the health care needs of the community. Our health \ncare providers who already are confronted with inadequate \nreimbursements, rising costs, and an increasing demand to provide care \nfor the uninsured. A tremendous $11 billion cut would far exacerbate \nthis problem and perhaps hold tragic consequences for welfare \nrecipients only beginning to rebuild their way to self-sufficiency.\n\n  The resolution before us would also strike $3 billion from the EITC--\na refundable credit that helps lower income individuals and families to \nmeet essential needs--food, clothing, housing, transportation, and \neducation. The Census Bureau notes that the credit lifted nearly 4 \nmillion people above the poverty line in 2001. This year, families can \nexpect an average refund of $2,067, which can mean a stay of eviction, \ntransportation to a decent paying job for the year, or food in \nchildren's bellies. The EITC can mean the equivalent of a $2 an hour \nraise in the salary for working mothers and fathers.\n  I would like to present a visual image of just which families are \nreached by the EITC. As you can see in the chart behind me, courtesy of \nthe Brookings Institution, higher concentrations of EITC recipients are \nin the dark orange at more than 40 percent, with the percentage \ndecreasing as the colors move to yellow, then blue. We can see how \neffectively the EITC reaches families and communities in large cities \nand all across the rural South. Highest concentrations of EITC \nrecipients as a percentage of total filers in a state can be found in \nAlabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico, South \nCarolina, and Texas.\n  Finally, an analysis of delegations by state clearly shows that the \nEITC should remain a bipartisan issue. The 18 States that have two \nSenators from my side of the aisle have 15.2 percent of all EITC \nearners, while the 19 States with two Senators from the other side of \nthe aisle have an even greater percentage of recipients at 17.2 percent \nof all EITC filers. All total, EITC assistance of almost $36 billion is \nlifting our communities representing meaningful relief for millions of \nEITC earners, whose numbers grew by 8 percent between tax years 2000 \nand 2002 due to the economic downturn and longer-term unemployment \ntrends.\n  Mr. President, in closing, we should not be attempting to produce \nsavings for ill-timed tax cuts by denying such assistance to those in \nour states who most need it. Without the Medicaid program and the EITC, \nmany families will go without health services and fundamental, everyday \npriorities. The Baucus amendment seeks to ensure that the working poor \nwill have access to the healthcare that they and their children need, \nand the financial assistance that will provide for their essential \nexpenses.\n  I have sent to my colleagues in the Senate a copy of the statement of \nthe low-wage workers. I have also sent a ``Dear Colleague'' letter to \neach office on the earned-income tax credit map we have shown.\n  I hope all of my colleagues will look at the EITC predicament and \nsupport the Baucus amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might \nconsume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, during this debate on this amendment, we \nhave heard there is going to be $11 billion cut from various programs \nunder the jurisdiction of the Senate Finance Committee. I have the \nbudget resolution in front of me. I defy anybody to tell me where in \nthis budget resolution there is an $11 billion cut.\n  I want to make it clear. What has been said, thus far, is based on \nsome assumptions, assumptions that, in the global view of all the \npossible assumptions that the Senate Finance Committee could draw on to \nsave a little\n\n[[Page S2522]]\n\nbit of money, it is in the realm of possibility, but it is a very \nextreme possibility of just exactly where the Senate Finance Committee \nends up to save $3.4 billion, not $11 billion. This comes from the fact \nthe budget includes an instruction to the Finance Committee to \nreconcile $3.4 billion over 5 years.\n  Now, if you were talking on ``Main Street'' in Waterloo, IA, about \nsaving $3.4 billion over 5 years, out of the trillions of dollars that \nthe Federal Government is going to spend over that period of 5 years, \nand you wanted to explain to somebody that you could not save a \nfraction of 1 percentage point, they would say: You better get some \nbusinessperson to serve in the U.S. Senate because the average \nbusinessperson has to deal with problems like that all the time. It is \na small amount of money, but it is still some direction given to the \ncommittee.\n  Now, exactly where we might do that--there has been a lot said \ntonight, that somehow people know exactly where the Senate Finance \nCommittee is going to get this sort of reconciled figure. I would have \nto say, I do not know yet. I do not know yet because I have not looked \nat all the possibilities. I do not know yet for a second reason: that \neven if I had a very good idea of exactly where this ought to come \nfrom, a chairman of a committee, particularly of the Senate Budget \nCommittee, does not run the Finance Committee. We do things in a \nbipartisan fashion in that committee. Even within the Democrats, there \nis a difference of opinion, not a unified position among Democrats and, \nfor sure, among my Republican members of the committee there is not a \nunified position.\n  It takes a lot of compromise to do anything in the Finance Committee. \nWhen you are talking about even saving a fraction of 1 percent--a very \nsmall fraction of 1 percent--let me tell you, there would still be a \ngreat deal of difference of opinion that it ought to be done. The fact \nis, there is nothing in this budget resolution that says where we have \nto save that money. That is our committee's decision.\n  When you vote this week on this budget resolution or when you vote on \nthis amendment, I want to make it very clear to you that there is \nnothing in this that says how this money ought to be saved. So I can \nsay to any of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle: I do not \nwant this program cut. Another one says: I do not want that program \ncut. I can say: There is nothing in this resolution that says I have to \ncut program ``ABC'' or ``DEF.'' It is what we can do in our committee.\n  For sure, there has been a great deal of talk about it might come out \nof Medicaid or it might come out of the earned-income tax credit. Maybe \nit could, to some extent. But I do not know that yet. Even if I knew \nit, I could not produce 11 votes this minute, and that is the way it \nought to be. This has to be a thoughtful process.\n  All we are doing in this budget resolution is making an overview of \nthe fiscal policy of the Congress for the next 12 months. That is all \nwe are doing. We are doing that so all the committees of Congress are \ndisciplined. Before the budget resolution, when it came to fiscal \nmatters, every committee and subcommittee in Congress was a kingdom \nunto itself. And what was the fiscal policy of the Congress of the \nUnited States? It was the total action of all the separate committees.\n  But the Budget Committee is set up so that before you spend money, \nbefore you make tax policy, you have a well-thought-out process of \nkeeping within certain limits so that each committee is not a kingdom \nunto itself, but they are disciplined by the total view expressed in \nthe Congress in a budget resolution--in the Senate and House \nseparately; and then, after compromise between the two Houses, that \npolicy is adopted.\n  Now, the budget assumes additional savings, but the Finance Committee \nis not required to reconcile these savings. Striking the $3.4 billion \nreconciliation instruction does not remove these other nonbinding \nsavings. These nonbinding assumptions would remain. This amendment does \nnot change any--does not change any--of those assumptions.\n  The amendment deals with $3.4 billion, but all the debate has been \nabout certain assumptions, and there is nothing in the amendment that \nchanges any of those assumptions. So what all the debate has been about \nis not what you are going to be voting on. You are going to be voting \non $3.4 billion being saved. But the debate has been about, ``Oh, the \nmoney is going to come out of Medicaid; the money is going to come out \nof the earned-income tax credit'' because of some assumptions that were \nmade. But the assumptions are not binding. The amendment before us does \nnot even change the assumptions.\n  As to the point that the House-passed reconciliation bill could be \nhandled in the Senate under what we call the rule XIV procedure--which \nis a way of bypassing the Finance Committee--the Congressional Budget \nAct clearly states that only a bill reported by the Finance Committee \nis entitled to the reconciliation protections. So you cannot bring \nsomething over from the House under rule XIV and have it reconciled. \nOur committee, and only our committee, has the responsibility to deal \nwith this for the Senate.\n  Now, speaking to a specific program, I would address the issue that \nhas come up about Medicaid. As chairman of the Senate Finance \nCommittee--we have jurisdiction over the entire Medicaid Program--I am \nnot bound by those budgetary assumptions. That is the third time I have \nsaid it. I hope it is clear. The chairman of the Senate Budget \nCommittee and the Budget Committee can put certain assumptions in the \nresolution, and those are legitimate assumptions to put in the report, \nalthough we do not vote on those assumptions. But they are assumptions \nbecause it is legitimate for those of us in the Congress to expect the \nBudget Committee to be responsible. If you are going to put down a \nfigure, you ought to have something to back it up. It should not be \npulled out of the clear blue sky. It ought to be based on certain \nassumptions. That is what the Budget Committee and the chairman did, \nand that is what they should be doing. Now, I am not bound by those. I \nhave respect for those, though, I want to point out, as I have respect \nfor the work of the Budget Committee and its chairman. But I don't have \nto share the assumptions that any Budget Committee makes on how to \narrive at the figure. In this particular instance, I might have \ndifferent views about Medicaid. Frankly, I do. But that is not the \nissue of debate.\n\n  I happen to believe Medicaid is a vital safety net program for our \nmost vulnerable citizens. It is for people who are low income. It is \nfor pregnant women. It is for the elderly, for the disabled, and for \nothers. States also spend a significant amount of their budgets on \nMedicaid. When I look at a program, how we save Medicaid money, if we \ngo there--and we are going to have a responsibility to look at all this \nstuff; we might not even look at Medicaid at all, but we might--I have \nto be mindful of any effective changes we make to the Medicaid Program \nthat it might have on the States, because this is a program where there \nis a partnership between the Federal Government and State governments \nand, in some States, even local governments.\n  Last year, for instance, this entire Congress felt very serious about \ndoing something to help States, in addition to what we would do through \nFederal grants to the States, emergency grants, because most of the \nStates had very tight budget situations. We gave $20 billion relief to \nStates, of which $10 billion was just for Medicaid. I say that not that \nyou need to be reminded of it, but I want you to know our committee, \neven 8 months ago, took into consideration the needs of the States.\n  I am going to look at how Federal tax dollars are spent, but I also \nhave to know there is some impact they have on the States.\n  We also have to look at the reality of every Federal program. They \nought to be reviewed from time to time. It seems to me we can look at \nMedicaid not as some sacred cow. Not that it is not a good program, not \nthat it should not be preserved. It is part of the social safety net of \nour society. It will be maintained. It is a program that is 38 years \nold. But it is only an extension of a 200-year history our society has \nhad of taking care of the most vulnerable, originally, entirely by \ncounties or local governments. Then the States got involved, and then, \nin the 1940s, the Federal Government got involved in several ways. Then \nthat was all kind of put together in the 1960s in the Medicaid Program.\n  There is no reason to think this is some sort of a flawless program \nthat\n\n[[Page S2523]]\n\ncan't be made a better program. You don't even have to assume it is \nsome program that at least a fraction of 1 percent maybe can't be saved \nto some extent. No conclusions on my part, but I wouldn't be a very \ngood public official, a very good trustee of the taxpayers' money if I \nthought any program couldn't be looked at to see could we save a half \nof 1 percent out of that program.\n  I am not opposed to reviewing whether there are instances of fraud or \nabuse in the Medicaid Program, but I want you to know that I will \nconduct oversight activities and do it in the open. I will do it in a \nbipartisan manner. I am going to do it with extensive input from \nstakeholders.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator Grassley, \nchairman of the Finance Committee, for his statement. He happens to be \nexactly right. The net essence of this reconciliation instruction is to \ntell the Finance Committee, save $3.4 billion over the next 5 years. \nThe Finance Committee is an enormous committee. It has jurisdiction \nover welfare, Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, a total of about \n$4.6 trillion over the next 5 years. Surely this committee can find \n$3.4 billion of waste, of money that should not be spent.\n  Senator Byrd alluded to the reconciliation process and said it is \nsupposed to be used to save money, to reduce the deficit. We gave an \ninstruction to the Finance Committee to do that. Can't we save at least \n$3.5 billion out of $4.6 trillion?\n  I have heard people say: It is going to mean some cuts in Medicaid. \nMedicaid has a lot of fraud. I tell my colleagues and my good friend \nfrom North Dakota, I may want to do a hearing in the Budget Committee, \nif the Finance Committee is not willing to do it. Let's get into these \nintergovernmental transfers. Let's find out about how much some States \nare ripping off the Medicaid system. I use that term exactly as I meant \nit, ripping off the Medicaid system, ripping off the Federal \nGovernment, taking a program that is supposed to be 50-50 Federal-State \nand turning it into a program where the Federal Government pays 100 \npercent.\n  There are some proprietors who specialize in how to milk the Federal \nGovernment on Medicaid where the State doesn't even have a match. They \ndon't have to pay anything. It is all Federal Government. They are \ndoing that today in a lot of States. Maybe they will pay a little \npayment to the hospital if they will participate. There are a lot of \nschemes, scams, I think fraud, probably should be totally illegal, some \nof it may be bordering on illegality, to the tune of billions of \ndollars. The committee doesn't have to do that. We just said: Look, \ncan't you find at least $3.5 billion?\n  We have the appropriators tell us day after day: Wait a minute. We \nonly appropriate maybe about 30-some percent of the budget. Don't make \nus take the full brunt of any savings plan. What about those \nentitlements? Year after year people say: We can't do that.\n  My guess is you could find this amount of savings in a number of \nentitlements. The committee has jurisdiction over welfare. Are you \ngoing to tell me there is not welfare abuse; that it couldn't be \ntightened up?\n  One assumption I think we need to look at is the earned-income tax \ncredit. This is a $36 billion program our Federal Government is writing \na check for every year; in some cases, a lump sum in excess of $4,000 \nfor a family. We find out it has abuse of 27 to 30 percent from fraud \nor incorrect payments. We can't tighten that up? I didn't say 5-percent \nfraud. I didn't say 10 percent. I said 27 to 32 percent of fraud or \nmispayment in the earned-income tax credit program. Surely we can \ntighten that up. That program over the next 5 years will be about $170 \nbillion or something. Surely we can find some savings in that program.\n  Whether you are talking about Medicaid, Medicare--there is fraud in \nMedicare. We have had some people put in jail because of fraud in \nMedicare. Let's tighten it up. We have deficits. We can't afford to \nhave fraud. We can't afford to have this kind of cheating system going \non day in and day out. It has happened frequently.\n  So should we not look at the two-thirds of the budget, two-thirds of \nthe budget that many people say: That is untouchable; let's not do \nanything to Social Security. I don't want Social Security fraud. When \nyou are spending the kind of money we are, there is some fraud. I think \nwe should look at every dollar.\n  The Finance Committee has enormous jurisdiction and is very capably \nled by Senator Grassley. He is exactly right: $3.4 billion out of a \ntotal of $4.6 trillion is .0007 percent. It is not one-tenth of 1 \npercent. It is less than that. It is such a small figure. Yet some \npeople are acting as if the sky is falling because somebody is afraid \nmaybe their gravy train of abuse might not be able to continue or \nsomebody is saying: Wait a minute, we have been doing that for a long \ntime. I want to make sure I can continue.\n  I say: What is your program? Let's eliminate some fraud. Let's \neliminate some waste. Let's give the discretion to the Finance \nCommittee to come up with some savings. Let's curtail the growth of \nentitlement programs if they are fraudulent, if they are incorrect.\n  I have great confidence Senator Grassley and Senator Baucus are not \ngoing to report anything out of the Finance Committee that is not going \nto be fair if they are talking about trying to tighten up some of the \nabuses in the system.\n  They are not limited. They are not bound. They are not directed to do \nanything except can't you save $3.5 billion over the next 5 years when \nwe assume spending under the committee's jurisdiction will be $4.6 \ntrillion? Surely that can be done.\n  Again, appropriators have said: Let's not have us bear the full \nbrunt. Let's have savings elsewhere in the budget. These are very minor \nsavings, very doable savings.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no on the Baucus amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, America faces a continuing health care \ncrisis, and this budget makes it even worse for those on Medicaid. For \nyears, that State-funded program has provided health insurance coverage \nfor the poor. Because of the fiscal pressures created by the failed \nBush economic policies, States have already had to drop 1.5 million \npeople--half of them children--from the Medicaid rolls. Instead of \nhelping States provide insurance coverage, this budget actually cuts \nMedicaid further. That is the wrong policy--and this amendment will \nreverse it.\n  The Bush administration is out of touch with the reality of the \nplight of working Americans across the Nation. The unemployment rate \ncontinues high, and no end to this crisis is in sight. In addition to \nstruggling to pay their rent and buy food for their families, millions \nof Americans are also having to go without needed health care.\n  Almost 44 million Americans are uninsured and this number is rising. \nHealth costs are soaring at double-digit rates each year. As health \ninsurance premiums continue to soar, employees and employers alike \nworry that they will not be able to keep their coverage.\n  Those without health insurance pay a cruel price. A third of \nAmericans without insurance say they do without recommended treatment \nbecause they can't afford it. A third report not filling a prescription \nbecause of cost. Almost half report postponing care because of cost. \nThese facts have real health consequences. According to the Institute \nof Medicine, 18,000 Americans die every year, simply because they don't \nhave health insurance. Thousands more suffer needlessly or acquire \nearly disabilities.\n  The Republican budget ignores this crisis, without any credible \nproposal to protect the uninsured or reduce the rising cost. Instead, \nthe Republican budget makes the problem worse, by slashing $11 billion \nfrom Medicaid over the next 5 years.\n  Medicaid is a lifeline for 50 million Americans who have no other \naccess to health care. Medicaid provides needed prenatal care to \npregnant women. It means that children receive early and periodic \nscreening, diagnosis, and treatment. They get immunizations and other \nhealth services. Millions of low-income elderly seniors rely on \nMedicaid to pay the health and nursing home costs that Medicare doesn't \ncover.\n\n[[Page S2524]]\n\n  States are struggling to maintain their share of Medicaid in the face \nof severe budget deficits. Last year, States had a combined deficit of \n$78 billion, and another $40 billion shortfall is expected this year. \nThe State Medicaid cuts last year would have been far worse without the \n$20 billion State relief passed by Congress to help meet it a year ago. \nWe should continue that assistance now, not make the problem worse by \nslashing benefits to the most vulnerable Americans.\n  The amendment we are proposing will eliminate the unfair \nreconciliation instruction that would force the Finance Committee to \ncut $11 billion more from Medicaid. These harsh cuts are opposed by \nmore than 155 national organizations, including physicians, hospitals, \nchildren, the elderly, women, religious organizations, and professional \nassociations. The National Governors Association opposes these cuts. \nThe American Hospital Association opposes these cuts. The American \nMedical Association opposes these cuts. The American Health Care \nAssociation opposes these cuts. The Children's Defense Fund opposes \nthese cuts. The National Organization for Women and Families opposes \nthese cuts.\n  The American people understand that these cuts are cruel and \ncounterproductive. They are the wrong priority for America, and I urge \nthe Senate to approve this amendment and preserve health care coverage \nfor millions of Americans.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I rise in strong support of the amendment to save \ncrucial programs like Medicaid from being slashed by this short-sighted \nbudget.\n  This is a time when American families are still struggling to find \njobs, and the new jobs they are finding are often low-wage jobs that \nlack health insurance. In this setting, Medicaid remains an essential \n``safety-net'' in the provision of health and long term care services \nfor millions of Americans.\n  Meanwhile, even as need is greater, States' revenues are declining, \nso there are fewer and fewer resources to meet those needs. New York \nhad a $6.8 billion budget gap last year, $11.5 billion in '03/'04--\nthat's 25 percent of the general fund. This is a pattern repeated for \nall the states. Texas had a 15 percent shortfall. Alabama faced a \nshortage amounting to 16.5 percent of the general fund. And because \nStates, unlike the Federal Government, often face State constitutional \nprovisions that prevent them from carrying a deficit, they are forced \nto cut benefits to make ends meet, thus slashing eligibility, starving \nhospitals and physicians, and slashing services. We see that happening \nall over the country.\n  But instead of acting to prevent these cuts, and stanch the bleeding, \nthis budget turns the knife further and forces $11 billion in \nunspecified cuts to Medicaid at a time when such cuts would cripple \nstates' ability to serve American families in hard times.\n  We have all been on record supporting the important safety net role \nthat Medicaid plays when American families are hard-pressed to find \njobs. Last year, we worked hard to recognize the existing financial \ninstability threatening the Medicaid program. We provided $10 billion \nin temporary State fiscal relief directed at Medicaid. Thanks to this \nrelief, States and local communities have been able to continue to \nmaintain their Medicaid programs and avert drastic cuts in local \nservices. But the fiscal relief is due to expire in 3 months, even as \nState budget situations remain in critical condition. And as the jobs \nsituation continues to look dire, Medicaid is as critical as ever to \nensuring the health of millions of Americans. Now is not the time to \nmake additional reductions in federal Medicaid funding.\n  We must reject the Medicaid reduction provisions in the budget and, \nin doing so, take a stand to protect the health and long term care \nneeds of our nation's struggling families, our elderly and disabled. \nThat is why I urge my colleagues to support the Baucus amendment to \nreduce the amount of cuts that would otherwise have to come from \nMedicaid.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am wondering at this point if we can \nreach an agreement on the additional time on this amendment. Senator \nBaucus tells me he only requires 5 more minutes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent there be 5 \nminutes on each side remaining on the Baucus amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I want to address a couple of points that \nI think need to be addressed. They are a bit misleading. First, there \nis no language in the budget that specifically requires the Medicaid \ncuts. So why pass this? The fact is, with all due respect to the \nchairman of the Budget Committee, during markup the chairman said \nbasically that we assumed the $11 billion in mandatory cuts was going \nto come from Medicaid. That is the chairman's assumption. He made that \nvery clear. He wants it to come out of Medicaid.\n  As we know around here, that is the general thrust of measures we \npass that are in the budget resolution, and that is what is going to \nhappen. As long as I have been here, and I have been here a long time, \nthat is the way this place operates.\n  There are clearly going to be cuts there. So the point that cuts in \nMedicaid are specifically required, that is not true. Are they \neffectively required? Clearly, yes. Also, it has been suggested there \nis a lot of fraud, waste, and abuse. That is a bit of a disingenuous \nstatement. First, we never condone fraud and abuse. We don't need a \nstatute to allow that. There are anti-fraud and anti-abuse laws. There \nare no specific fraud and abuse proposals. It just says cut.\n  If there is no proposal, as I said earlier, Joint Tax has not scored \nanything that amounts to raising revenue. By logical conclusion, we are \ngoing to cut Medicaid; it is that simple. It sounds good, this fraud, \nwaste, and abuse, but it is just going to be a straight cut. There is \nno specific proposal that addresses that.\n  Also, we are already so-called cutting waste. There is a $2 billion \nsavings, a cut in error rates, because the administration is looking at \nthis more closely, which is good. There are a lot of error rates \nelsewhere in the code, not just for low-income people. It is in sole \nproprietorships and other categories of taxpayers as well. We are not \ncracking down on them; we are cracking down on poor people. That is the \nwrong thing to do.\n  The main point is this is a cut in Medicaid. That is clearly what is \nintended. Second, this is not a fraud, waste, and abuse cleanup; it is \na cut in Medicaid. Be honest. That is the effective result.\n  Technically--it is a small point--some of the concern about error \nrates in Medicaid is because States controlling the Medicaid Programs \nare undertaking actions that are now being corrected by Uncle Sam. So \nit is not the fault of the low-income folks. It is not the earned-\nincome tax credit or the refundability portion. That is a small part of \nthe problem. Rather, it just changes the administration of it between \nUncle Sam and the States.\n  This is a good amendment. We should not cut Medicaid. We should not \ncut folks who get the advantage of the marriage penalty by $21.6 \nbillion. That is the effect of the cut that is going to be required in \nthe budget resolution.\n  My amendment says, let's eliminate that requirement and deal with \nMedicaid and other programs as we normally do in the normal course of \nbusiness.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I think Senator Grassley said it very \nwell. He is chairman of the committee. He said the committee can find \n$3.4 billion out of $4.6 trillion. I think it could be in Medicaid or \nin the earned-income tax credit. I think it could be in almost any \nprogram, such as the welfare program. I have no doubt whatsoever there \nis plenty of abuse. The administration talked about the \nintergovernmental transfers. There is lots of abuse.\n  I am going to embarrass our colleagues by getting into this in \ndetail. I will show people how some States have been ripping off this \nsystem--probably to a much greater extent than even what has been \nbantered about. It is happening today. Many States are doing it.\n  I will tell my colleagues that we found we had payment abuse in \nMedicaid in years past. You might remember the program. We had to \ntighten it up. There has been some tightening of\n\n[[Page S2525]]\n\nthe intergovernmental transfer but not very much. A lot more could be \ndone.\n  The Federal Government should not be taking Medicaid dollars and \ngiving it to States to pave roads. In some cases, Medicaid money is \nbeing used by States for a lot of things other than Medicaid. I am \ntelling you, I come to this Senate with, I hope, a little bit of \ncredibility. I am not making this up. Maybe a more thorough evaluation \nin the committees would expose some of this. The earned-income tax \nprogram, people don't want to touch it. Yet the GAO says there is an \nerror rate, a fraud rate in 27 to 30 percent, or a 32-percent fraud in \na program that spends $36 billion a year, and we cannot direct the \ncommittee to say, Can you not come up with some savings? I am \nembarrassed.\n  If we are not going to stay let's at least do some shaving of the \ngrowth of some of the fraud in the entitlement programs, two-thirds of \nthe Federal Government or of the budget, if we cannot shave a little \nspending in this area, shame on us.\n  For the people who act as if I am a deficit hawk, I want to get the \ndeficit down. The last time we had significant instruction to reduce \nthe growth of some of these entitlements to take out some abuse was in \n1997. Some of my colleagues say we got the deficit down. The biggest \nspending reduction thing we did--maybe one was shutting down the \nGovernment in 1995 for a while, but the biggest thing was in the 1997 \nbill that had reconciliation instructions, had significant savings. A \nlot of the people taking credit for the great savings we did in the \nnineties didn't vote for that.\n  Anyway, to ask this committee to find $3.4 billion out of $4.6 \ntrillion over the next 5 years is not heavy lifting, as Senator \nGrassley alluded to. I agree with him entirely. I think the committee \ncan find this much and more. I urge our colleagues to, at the \nappropriate time, vote no on the Baucus amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, my understanding of the Baucus amendment \nis that he has not taken out the savings at all. All he does is take \nout the reconciliation instruction. The savings are still there.\n  Let me comment for a moment, if I can, on what Chairman Nickles is \nsaying, because he is talking about something where I entirely agree \nwith him.\n  In Medicaid, there are States that are engaged in scams. I don't know \nhow else to say it. What Chairman Nickles has said is entirely \naccurate. There are States that have figured out ways of tapping into \nthe Federal Treasury and replacing what should be State funds with \nFederal funds. There is nobody who studies this who doesn't know what \nthe chairman has said is true.\n  There are a number of States that have almost made a science out of \nplaying games with Federal programs, to tap into the Federal Treasury, \nto advantage their States to the disadvantage of Federal taxpayers and \nto the disadvantage of other States.\n  But I repeat, in looking at the amendment of Senator Baucus, he has \nnot taken out those savings. Those savings remain in the underlying \nresolution. It does take out the reconciliation instruction. So I have \nconcluded that the Baucus amendment is worthy of support.\n  What the chairman has said is something I join in, especially with \nrespect to Medicaid Program abuses. I am very hopeful we will have a \nhearing on these issues once we get past the budget resolution and the \nnegotiations in which the chairman will have to be involved in the \ncoming days. We ought to put a bright light on some of these States \nthat are engaged in a scam operation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, we yield back the remainder of our time. \nI believe the Senator from Ohio has an amendment. He has requested 25 \nminutes on his side. I know a couple of other colleagues have \namendments. We told people to expect votes at 9 o'clock. I would like \nto get in three or four amendments, if possible. I call upon our \ncolleague from Ohio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, maybe we can lock in an agreement. Is \nthere any way the Senator from Ohio would take 20 minutes on his side, \nand we will take 20 minutes on this side? I would even take 15 minutes \non this side if the Senator would reduce his time to 20 minutes. That \nwill give us a chance to offer another amendment or two before the \nvoting starts.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I think I need 25 minutes, but it may \nbe 20. I think I need 25 minutes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Ohio be \nrecognized for his amendment not to exceed 25 minutes, and the Senator \nfrom North Dakota be recognized for 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Ohio.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2705\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2705 and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Ohio [Mr. Voinovich] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2705.\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To balance the budget and lock away the Social Security \nsurplus by establishing a supermajority point of order prohibiting the \nconsideration of any bill that raids the Social Security Trust Fund by \n  exceeding a declining level of on-budget deficits on a fiscal year \n                                 basis)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . BALANCED BUDGET POINT OF ORDER.\n\n       (a) In General.--Except as provided in subsection (b), it \n     shall not be in order in the Senate to consider any bill or \n     resolution (or any amendment, motion, or conference report on \n     that bill or resolution) that would result in an on budget \n     deficit larger than--\n       (1) in fiscal year 2004, $639,000,000,000;\n       (2) in fiscal year 2005, $575,000,000,000;\n       (3) in fiscal year 2006, $511,000,000,000;\n       (4) in fiscal year 2007, $447,000,000,000;\n       (5) in fiscal year 2008, $383,000,000,000;\n       (6) in fiscal year 2009, $319,000,000,000;\n       (7) in fiscal year 2010, $255,000,000,000;\n       (8) in fiscal year 2011, $191,000,000,000;\n       (9) in fiscal year 2012, $127,000,000,000;\n       (10) in fiscal year 2013, $63,000,000,000; and\n       (11) in fiscal year 2015, $0.\n       (b) Exception.--Subsection (a) shall not apply if--(1) the \n     President has declared a state of national emergency; or (2) \n     the economy is in recession, defined as 3 consecutive \n     quarters of negative growth in Gross Domestic Product.\n       (c) Supermajority.--(1) Waiver.--This section may be waived \n     or suspended in the Senate only by the affirmative vote of \n     three-fifths of the Members, duly chosen and sworn.\n       (2) Appeals.--Appeals in the Senate from the decisions of \n     the Chair relating to any provision of this section shall be \n     limited to 1 hour, to be equally divided between, and \n     controlled by, the appellant and the manager of the bill or \n     joint resolution, as the case may be. An affirmative vote of \n     three-fifths of the Members of the Senate, duly chosen and \n     sworn, shall be required in the Senate to sustain an appeal \n     of the ruling of the Chair on a point of order raised under \n     this section.\n       (d) Exercise of Rulemaking Powers.--Congress adopts the \n     provisions of this section--(1) as an exercise of the \n     rulemaking power of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives, respectively, and as such they shall be \n     considered as part of the rules of each house, or of that \n     house to which they specifically apply, and such rules shall \n     supersede other rules only to the extent that they are \n     inconsistent therewith; and (2) with full recognition of the \n     constitutional right of either house to change those rules \n     (so far as they relate to that house) at any time, in the \n     same manner, and to the same extent as in the case of any \n     other rule of that house.\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, before I speak in regard to this \namendment, I would like to comment on the discussion that was going on \nwith regard to Medicaid. There is no question that as a former Governor \nI observed my colleagues around the country gaming the system, and I \nwas very upset about it. I made it very clear as chairman of the \nNational Governors Association that this was an understanding we had \nwith the Federal Government and that we ought not to game the system.\n  I will never forget while I was Governor there was a management \ncompany, which is no longer in business, that went out to the school \ndistricts and showed them how they could use the money they were \nspending for\n\n[[Page S2526]]\n\nhealth care and use it to game the Medicaid system. They would charge a \npercentage of the money they were able to bring into the school \ndistrict. When I found out about it, I went beserk, to put it as nicely \nas I can, and that stopped. But I do think it is not a sacred cow that \nought not be looked at. Just like a lot of mandatory spending we have, \nit should be reviewed to see if there are ways we can save some money.\n  Mr. President, I support this budget resolution, and I applaud \nSenator Nickles for his diligence and fiscal responsibility. The budget \nresolution we are considering builds on the success of the resolution \nSenator Nickles crafted last year. The fiscal year 2004 budget \nresolution reestablished fiscal discipline and provided reconciliation \ninstructions for a stimulus package that generated 4-percent economic \ngrowth in 2003.\n  The fiscal year 2004 budget resolution also balanced fiscal \ndiscipline with a very real need to stimulate the economy. Although the \neconomy started to grow after the 2001 tax reforms, the growth was very \nsluggish and did not create many jobs. Real growth in GDP was 2.9 \npercent in 2001 and 2.8 percent in 2002.\n  Consequently, the fiscal year 2004 budget resolution included \nreconciliation instructions for a modest, highly targeted economic \nstimulus package that Congress adopted in May of last year--a $350 \nbillion stimulus package. By the end of the year, economic growth \nreached 4.4 percent, and unemployment had finally fallen below 6 \npercent. Most experts expect the economy to grow by more than 4 percent \nthis year and for unemployment to continue to fall.\n  Unfortunately, my own State of Ohio has not participated as fully in \nthe recovery as some of the other States. We need to continue the \nstimulus measures to make sure Ohio's economy takes off. We have too \nmany people out of work in my State. We have too many people who are \nconcerned about whether or not they are going to have a job. I agree \nwith the President that we should not rest until every American who \nwants a job has one.\n  Congress also provided direct assistance to working families last \nyear when we accelerated the phase-in of the child tax credit, \neliminated the marriage penalty, and expanded the number of families \npaying income taxes at the lowest rate of 10 percent. I supported these \ntax reform provisions when they were enacted last year and even joined \nwith Senator Snowe and Senator Lincoln to encourage the Finance \nCommittee to expand refundability of the child tax credit for families \nwith incomes between $10,500 and $25,000 per year.\n  For many families in Ohio, these tax reform provisions meant they \ncould buy presents for Christmas as well as food. For some, it meant \nthey could pay the heating bill. All families benefited from these \nreforms, and I am proud we supported them.\n\n  Fortunately, Senator Nickles has again crafted a budget resolution \nthat balances fiscal discipline with the need to continue assisting \nlow-income families. The Budget Committee makes hard decisions by \nassuming a freeze for most spending programs at 2004 spending levels, \nwith increases for high-priority programs and reductions for low-\npriority, one-time, or expired programs. Nevertheless, the committee \nrecognizes fiscal reality and provides a contingency fund of up to $30 \nbillion for 2005 to fund ongoing military operations in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. Also, at long last, the Budget Committee addresses runaway \nincreases in mandatory spending and proposes a $4.6 billion net \nreduction in mandatory spending programs over 5 years.\n  The fiscal year 2005 budget resolution also assumes Congress will act \nto close tax loopholes identified by the President and by the tax-\nwriting committees. The committee builds upon the budget discipline \nincluded in last year's budget resolution by establishing enforceable \ncaps on discretionary spending for 2005 and 2006.\n  The spending caps are set at levels consistent with the discretionary \nspending assumptions and are enforced with a 60-vote point of order. \nThe Budget Committee continues a 60-vote point of order against \nadvanced appropriations that exceed current levels.\n  These budget enforcements proved very important last year. There were \n67 attempts to increase spending by waiving the Budget Act, and we \nsuccessfully fought back 64 of them and saved this country billions of \ndollars of additional spending.\n  Finally, the budget resolution assumes continued budget enforcement \nunder existing mechanisms for nondefense emergency spending and pay-as-\nyou-go. In other words, if you want to spend the money, you find \noffsets or you find revenues that you can increase to pay for them.\n  Equally important, the resolution before us today includes tax policy \nassumptions focused on preventing economically damaging tax increases \non working families.\n  The budget resolution proposes to extend the personal tax relief \ncurrently scheduled to expire at the end of 2004, including the $1,000-\nper-child tax credit, the 10-percent income tax bracket expansion, and \nmarriage penalty relief. The budget resolution assumes a revenue loss \nof $80.6 billion from 2005 to 2009 for these proposals and directs the \nSenate Finance Committee to produce a reconciliation bill to facilitate \ntheir enactment.\n  Let's put that $80.6 billion in context. I remind my colleagues that \nin one fell swoop, we spent $87 billion to provide funding for the war \nin Afghanistan and Iraq. That just gives us a figure. That is $87 \nbillion in 1 year, and we are talking about $80.6 billion over a 5-year \nperiod.\n  These provisions directly impact almost 90 million taxpayers \nnationwide, and about 4 million of them in my State. If they are not \nextended, a low-income family of four making $40,000 a year will go \nfrom receiving a small refund of $30 to paying the IRS an additional \n$800. Frankly, these families simply do not have the extra $800 to send \nto Washington at this time. So it is critical that we continue \nassisting them until the job market catches up with the growth in the \neconomy.\n  I fought very hard for the refundable child tax credit in the 2001 \ntax reform, addressing the marriage penalty problem that discouraged \nmany people from getting married because they paid higher taxes if they \ngot married, and moving the people in the 15-percent bracket down to 10 \npercent.\n  When we enacted tax reforms to provide assistance to working \nfamilies, I fully supported the sunset provisions that would allow \nthose provisions to expire when they were no longer needed.\n  Unfortunately, while the economic situation has improved, we are not \nout of the woods yet. In Ohio, over 96,000 initial claims for \nunemployment compensation were filed in January. That is why I voted to \nextend unemployment benefits and that is why I think this Senate should \nvote in the next several weeks to extend unemployment benefits.\n  Although this number is more than 5 percent lower than last year, it \nstill represents real families who have lost their principal source of \nincome. Also, many families and individuals who regained employment \nover the past 6 months must still pay off loans to make up late \npayments they missed while they were unemployed.\n  It is time for Congress and the Nation to acknowledge the size of the \nproblem we face. The Federal Government has a serious debt of almost $7 \ntrillion, annual unified deficits of $477 billion, and net interest \npayments that consume 7.5 percent of the Federal budget.\n  If we see interest rates start to go up in the next couple of years, \nthat 7.5 percent number could go up to 13 or 14 percent because that is \nwhat it was in 1999 when I came to the Senate.\n  Under current policy assumptions outlined in OMB's budget \nprojections, the Federal debt will exceed $9.3 trillion by 2008 and net \ninterest payments will claim 9.5 percent of our budget. If the private \nsector corporations ever issued similar financial projections, their \nstock value would plummet. Their credit rating would be discounted to \nbelow junk bond status and no bank on the planet would lend them \nadditional money. During the savings and loan crisis, the Resolution \nTrust Corporation liquidated companies with healthier balance sheets \nthan the Federal Government can produce today.\n  Whatever we may desire, until we restore some sort of fiscal \ndiscipline to Federal spending we may not be able to\n\n[[Page S2527]]\n\nafford any new initiatives, no matter how badly they are needed.\n  More importantly, we are rapidly approaching the time when much of \nthe debt comes due and we must carefully consider how we will meet this \nobligation. Currently, we borrow $160 billion to $175 billion each year \nfrom the Social Security trust fund. As the baby boom generation \nretires, this source of borrowing will no longer be available, and \nstarting in 2017 Social Security will start cashing in the bonds which \nmake up its assets. If we exercise fiscal discipline now, the Federal \nTreasury will be able to redeem those bonds with little or no negative \nimpact on the rest of the budget or the economy as a whole.\n  However, if we dig ourselves into deeper debt, we will only be able \nto pay our Social Security obligations by raising taxes or with \ndraconian cuts in other Federal programs.\n  For almost two decades starting in 1980, fiscal conservatives have \nworked hard to return the Federal Government to a balanced budget. For \na short time, after hand-to-hand combat--and I was here for that hand-\nto-hand combat--we met our goal for 2 years. In 1999, for the first \ntime in 30 years, we had a balanced budget, about $1 billion; in 2000, \nwe had an $87 billion budget surplus. That means we did not use Social \nSecurity to balance our budget.\n  However, our success in balancing the budget was short-lived. In the \nblink of an eye we returned to spending the Social Security surplus \nrunning large budget deficits. Today, instead of reducing our $7 \ntrillion national debt, we are expanding it. Unfortunately, as soon as \nwe achieved success we reversed course in 1998 and have been increasing \nspending ever since. Do we really want to lose 20 years of hard work? \nIs it not time we went back to what we were trying to do in 1999 and \n2000?\n\n  Since 1999, this body has increased Federal spending an average of 7 \npercent per year. If we maintain this pace, Federal spending will \ndouble every 10 years. Instead of doubling spending, we should be \ncutting it. We have consistently skirted the truth about how much we \nincrease spending and the size of the debt we are incurring.\n  Advance appropriations and other accounting gimmicks have become \ncommonplace in our budget process. Thank God these last two budgets \nhave gotten rid of most of the gimmicks we have had, but most of the \nAmerican public does not realize we are spending the Social Security \nsurplus. So although people may be going around Washington saying next \nyear's deficit will only be $477 billion, it will really be $639 \nbillion. According to the new CBO projections, we will spend all of the \n$162 billion of the Social Security surplus and issue new debt.\n  Our budget system is broken. Its obvious failure to perform is having \nserious consequences on our economy and, by extension, future Federal \nrevenues, deficits, and debt. That is why I am here to talk about our \nSocial Security lockbox amendment.\n  My amendment is simple. It caps the on-budget deficit at the level \nprojected by CBO for fiscal year 2004, $639 billion, and reduces it by \n10 percent each year thereafter. We are going to reduce it over 10 \nyears so at the end of a 10-year period, we will no longer be spending \nthe Social Security surplus. That means we will really have an on-\nbudget surplus.\n  This is a very conservative proposal. It has been 5 years since we \nhave had an on-budget surplus. This proposal proposes it will be 15 \nyears from 1999-2000 until we get back to where we were at that period \nof time.\n  This proposal has a nice, natural glide. We will go from $639 billion \nin 2004 to $575 billion to $511 billion to $447 billion, to $383 \nbillion to $319 billion. For my colleagues' information, the numbers I \nhave for the next couple of years, 2005 and 2006, are a little bit \nabove the on-budget numbers the Budget Committee is projecting.\n  Once we get to the fourth and fifth year, it is lower than the Budget \nCommittee has projected for that 5-year budget, and then we keep going \ndown to zero.\n  I recognize it would be unrealistic to eliminate the ongoing budget \ndeficit in a single year or even within 5 years. The attempt would \nrequire either draconian spending cuts or job-destroying tax increases. \nIt contains waivers to recognize national emergencies or a prolonged \nrecession.\n  I understand the need for waivers in case of emergencies. This is \nhard to believe, but Senator Miller and I drafted a Social Security \nlockbox that gained the support of the White House. We worked with them \nfor 6 months. We were going to announce it 2 days after 9/11. In other \nwords, we were all set to do it, have a nice press conference, and 9/11 \nhappened. Of course, that changed everything.\n  Nevertheless, Congress and the President can act now to prevent the \non-budget deficit from getting any larger and initiate a 10-year \nglidepath to reduce the on-budget deficit to zero, thereby limiting \ntransfers from the Social Security trust fund and at the end of the 10 \nyears placing the entire Social Security trust fund in the lockbox.\n\n  We need to get this bill passed because today our national debt \nstands at $6.2 trillion and until we restore some sort of fiscal \ndiscipline to Congress's spending habits, this number is only going to \nkeep going up.\n  It is immoral--it is immoral--to bequeath trillions of dollars in \ndebt to our children and grandchildren. One of the reasons I came to \nthis Congress was because I was concerned about my children and my \ngrandchildren; that we were going to balance the budget, that we were \ngoing to reduce the debt--good, solid Republican principles. We were \nthere in 1999 and 2000, and then we know what happened. We have to \nreturn to those days.\n  I know when people come into the office asking for money for \nparticular projects, I always ask them the same question, and that \nquestion is: Is this particular priority worth putting your children \nand grandchildren further into debt? I have done that with several \nveterans organizations during the last couple of days. They want \nmandatory spending for veterans health care. I pointed out to them how \nbad off we are, that we have a war going on and we have to be concerned \nabout our children and grandchildren, and if we do not do it there will \nnot be anything around in 10 or 12 years for anyone.\n  It is remarkable. Their attitudes change. Most of them look at me, \ntalk about it, and they say, I understand.\n  The problem today in America is people do not know how bad our debt \nis. They still think there is some kind of spigot we can turn on in \nWashington and take care of all the problems. It is our obligation to \ndo something about that. It is our obligation to make sure people \nunderstand how far in debt we are and the tough decisions we are going \nto have to make.\n  I applaud the chairman of the Budget Committee for giving \ninstructions to the Finance Committee and saying to them, let's find \nsome reductions in mandatory spending because that is where all the \nmoney is going. The discretionary part of the budget is minuscule \ncompared to the mandatory spending.\n  The amendment I offer today is a good start on the difficult path we \nmust take in order to ensure our economic freedom and security for the \nfuture. I urge my colleagues to consider not only what we propose today \nbut also to seriously consider what will happen to our Nation's economy \ntomorrow if we do nothing.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the stated purpose of the Voinovich \namendment, to prohibit consideration of any legislation that would raid \nthe Social Security trust fund, is one with which I strongly agree. It \nis a noble purpose. But I am afraid this amendment does not come close \nto achieving that purpose. Here is what this amendment does.\n  We are looking at a comparison between the CBO baseline deficits, \nthat would be the blue line; the dotted red line would be the Senate \nGOP budget plan, the deficits under that plan; the green line would be \nunder the Voinovich plan. What one sees is the deficits are higher \nunder the Voinovich plan for the next 3 years than under either the CBO \nbaseline or under the Senate GOP budget resolution. He is actually \ngoing further into the hole on the promise that 3 years from now, he \nwill have less of a deficit. He promises\n\n[[Page S2528]]\n\nless of a deficit out in 2008 and 2009. Unfortunately, because of the \nway it is constructed, you cannot even be sure you would have less of a \ndeficit out in 2008 and 2009. What you can be certain of is the \ndeficits will be higher in 2005, 2006, 2007.\n  Let me show my colleagues what I am talking about. Comparing to the \nCBO baseline, the deficits of the Senator from Ohio would be $78 \nbillion higher in 2005; $121 billion higher in 2006; $57 billion higher \nin 2007, with the promise that in 2008, they would be $24 billion lower \nand $89 billion lower in 2009. If you add this up, this is $256 billion \nmore deficit here and $113 billion less deficit there. That is more \ndeficits, not less. That is more.\n  I don't know what kind of a plan this is to save anything. It \ncertainly doesn't save Social Security. It digs the hole deeper. I \ndon't know what the intention was, but I did read what the effect is. \nCompared to the budget resolution before us, the amendment of the \nSenator from Ohio would increase the deficit by $63 billion this year, \n$66 billion in 2006, and $16 billion in 2007. That is a $145 billion \nincrease in the deficit over the next 3 years, on the promise that it \nis going to reduce it compared to the chairman's mark by $180 billion \nin 2008 and 2009. But because of technically the way it is drafted, you \nhave absolutely no assurance it is going to save on the deficit out in \n2008 and 2009 either. All I can say is the words are good, the \nsentiment is good, but the proposal goes in exactly the wrong \ndirection. It increases the deficits, it increases the debt. It makes \nno sense to this Senator.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I think perhaps the Senator is misinterpreting the \namendment. Fundamentally what this says is we are going to use these \nnumbers to get down, in 10 years, to an on-budget surplus like we had \nin 1999 and 2000. You are right, the amount of reduction in this \namendment allows for a higher debt, but the fact is, all this says is \nyou can raise a point of order if it exceeds this amount. I am not \nsuggesting we reach this amount. All I am saying is, understanding the \nway things work around this Senate as I have observed during the last 5 \nyears, we just go straight down and we have this opportunity to raise a \npoint of order if the amount of money exceeds the numbers we have in \nour proposed amendment.\n  It is a very simple way of achieving what my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle have talked about for a great period of time. The \npurpose of it is to allow us to raise a point of order. It takes 60 \nvotes to waive that point of order in terms of spending.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, if I could say this to the Senator, the \nproblem I think he has with his amendment is he has assumed the CBO \nbaseline unadjusted. I know this sounds like inside-the-beltway \ngobbledygook, but let me say this to the Senator. There was a \nsupplemental appropriations bill approved last year of $86 billion. I \nthink all my colleagues will remember that. The problem with the \nnumbers the Senator from Ohio has chosen is he has built that \nsupplemental appropriations bill--that was a one-time increase of $86 \nbillion--into that baseline figure. He has that $86 billion built in, \ngoing out all the years into the future. As a result, what you wind up \nwith is much higher deficits than if you used the adjusted baseline the \nchairman of the Budget Committee has adopted.\n  The chairman of the Budget Committee quite wisely and with strong \nsupport from the ranking member adjusted the CBO baseline by taking out \nthe future years' adoption of the one-time supplemental. The effect of \nthe Senator's amendment is to create higher deficits--or at least the \npotential for higher deficits--in each of the next 3 years by the \namounts that I talked about. These are the amounts: $256 billion over \nthe baseline that was adopted by the chairman. I say to the Senator, I \nthink that would just be a profound mistake.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I wonder if he had a chance to see the numbers I used \nin this amendment?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I think there is no question that in the first 3 years \nthe number is a little higher than what you projected, assuming this \n$86 billion hit we had last year. But the fact is, if you look at the \nnumbers for 2008 and 2009, the last 2 years of the 5-year budget \nresolution, our numbers are below the numbers projected by the Budget \nCommittee. In effect, in the first 3 years it may be a little higher. \nThat doesn't mean we are necessarily going to spend that money. But \nwhen we get to the fourth and fifth year, our numbers are below the \nnumbers projected in the budget.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would just say this to the Senator. I have great \nrespect for the Senator from Ohio. I think he has been one of the most \nlevelheaded Members here on issues of fiscal discipline. I think this \namendment in technical detail is flawed, and you will increase or give \nthe potential for substantial increases in the deficit in the first 3 \nyears, compared to the adjusted CBO baseline, a $256 billion increase.\n  My experience around here is the promise of more deficit reduction in \nthe fourth and fifth year is a distant hope, and what you presented is \na present threat of substantially increasing the deficit. I think that \nwill be just most unwise for the body. It is higher than the adjusted \nCBO baseline, higher deficits, higher deficits than in the underlying \nSenate budget resolution.\n  I hope my colleagues will resist this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, if we look at the practicality, I just \nused these numbers because it was 10 percent a year. But the fact is a \nbudget point of order will lie against the numbers that you are \nprojecting in the budget that came out of the Budget Committee. In \nother words, if we exceed your numbers, you are saying this number I am \nproposing is going to provide we can spend up to that amount of money.\n  I am saying the number coming out of the Budget Committee creates a \npoint of order you can't go beyond.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, let me say to the Senator that I know his \nintentions are good. I really do. I have great respect for the Senator.\n  The problem is, technically, with the baseline that has been adopted, \nhis numbers leave just so much room for additional deficits for these \nfirst 3 years, and I don't think you will ever catch up to it.\n  Chairman Nickles and I agreed with the Senator totally about \nadjusting the baseline so that one-time expenditures didn't get built \ninto future years' expenditures. Unfortunately, the Senator from Ohio \nhas taken the unadjusted Congressional Budget Office baseline that has \nthe one-time expenditures and includes them going forward in each and \nevery year. That adds hundreds of billions of dollars to expenditures \nover the next years of this budget. What you are left with, as I have \ndescribed, is higher deficits for the first 3 years, with the promise \nthat I am afraid will prove ephemeral, that you are going to get lower \ndeficits in the fourth and fifth year. I don't think that is a trade we \nought to make.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, the Senator from North Dakota has been \nhere longer than I have. He is the ranking member of the Budget \nCommittee. I have been interested in this budget for a long time, as he \nknows. I would like to ask him if we could achieve this in 10 years \nthrough a real on-budget surplus. Most people would say it would be \nmiraculous. But the point I am making is you could argue about this \nnumber. You can make a big deal out of it in terms of we know we are \ngoing to do this and you are going to raise these issues. But the real \nissue is to try to get down to where we were 5 years ago. I can assure \nyou, for this Congress to achieve this will be something very \nsignificant and cause a great deal of discipline in terms of extending \ntax reductions, and so forth.\n  In effect, in order to get here we are going to have to have some \npay-go restrictions in order to make that happen.\n  All I am saying is, say what you want about these first couple of \nyears, down the road the Senate could achieve what I have on this \nchart. It would be a wonderful gift to the American people because we \ncould guarantee to them that\n\n[[Page S2529]]\n\nwe are going to have a true on-budget surplus.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I don't want to prolong this debate. But I \nsay to the Senator that I think the intention is good. I think the \nlegal effect of what is before us does not accomplish the Senator's \npurpose. In fact, what we would wind up with is room for greater \ndeficits in the first 3 years, and you would never catch up in the \noutyears.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I can't understand that because the numbers provide \nfor the budget point of order. How can you say, if you have the number, \nthat you have a budget point of order, that you are not going to \nachieve these numbers?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Because what is critical to having a budget point of \norder that is actually effective in reducing deficits and debt in the \nfuture is having a baseline that really gets you the result you want. \nUnfortunately, the baseline the Senator has provided will not lead to \nthe result as depicted on the graph. That is our conclusion.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I would like to reiterate if we were \nable to achieve what this graph shows, it would be the greatest gift we \ncould give to our children and grandchildren because it would mean that \nwe have been fiscally responsible. The way we are trying to achieve it \nis to say we are not going to use the Social Security surplus. When we \nwere able to get that on-budget surplus in 1999 and 2000, I remember \nhow we always had to wrestle in order to not use the Social Security \nsurplus. It was a way that we were able to control spending. That is \nexactly what we are trying to do with this amendment.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I wish to compliment my colleague from \nOhio. I appreciate the amendment. If his amendment had our deficit \nprojection level for the first few years and then went down to zero, I \nwould probably support him. I can't support an amendment that would \nhave higher deficits than what we project in our budget. I have the \ngreatest respect for my colleague. He is very sincere. He is a deficit \nhawk. He is very interested in getting down to zero, as I am.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I would be more than happy to take my amendment and \nput the numbers of the Senator from North Dakota in for the first 3 \nyears so that it will take care of the problem the Senator made \nreference to and handle it that way so it eliminates any allegations \nthat somehow this amendment is going to allow for increased spending. I \nwould be more than happy to do that.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, for the information of our colleagues, \nmomentarily we will be taking up the Nelson amendment. We will have a \nvery short 10 minutes on each side on that amendment, and I expect we \nwould have three rollcall votes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I am happy to.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The Senator mentioned three rollcall votes, and then \nstay on the floor for other amendments to be offered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I would be happy to do that temporarily for some period \nof time. I know Senator Corzine has an amendment. I think he was next \nin line to lay one down. I was expecting that would be the first \namendment we would vote on tomorrow. But I will be happy to consider \nit. I know the Senator has an amendment that deals with homeland \nsecurity. I think Senator Cochran will be debating that issue. I am not \nsure he wants to debate it tonight. I would like to get the rollcalls \nstarted pretty quickly so we can get people home by 10 o'clock, or not \ntoo late thereafter.\n  Tomorrow, for the information of our colleagues, is going to be a \nvery tough day. We will have a lot of votes tomorrow. I expect we will \nhave a lot of votes on Friday. I am trying to cooperate to dispose of \nas many amendments as possible. I will be happy to work with my \ncolleague from Maryland to get in his amendment.\n  I have asked Senator Conrad to line up amendments on his side. I am \ntrying to line up amendments on my side.\n  Mr. SARBANES. What problem would it cause if we were to offer the \namendment after the votes and maybe even discuss it for a few minutes?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I might not have any objection. I would like to ask \nSenator Cochran. I just wanted Senator Cochran to be able to respond to \nmy colleague from Maryland. We may be able to do that. We could \nactually set aside the Corzine amendment and discuss the amendment of \nthe Senator from Maryland. I am willing to consider that.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I understand from talking to the desk \nin order to amend my amendment to reflect the numbers that were in the \nbudget that came out of the Budget Committee, I need consent from my \ncolleagues. I would like to move to amend and insert the numbers that \nwere in the budget resolution to eliminate the problem Senator Conrad \nhas brought to our attention so the numbers would reflect his numbers. \nAnd, I might point out the number in the third and fourth year is below \nthe number the Senator from North Dakota has in his budget numbers.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I would be constrained to object. I object \nbecause even with that change, he would still be substantially above \nthe Congressional Budget Office adjusted baseline. And he is still left \nwith an utterly unenforceable mechanism. I would be happy to sit down \nand talk with the Senator as to why that is the case. We would object.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, the order we have agreed upon now would \nbe to recognize the Senator from Florida. I ask unanimous consent there \nbe 10 minutes on each side on the Senator's amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2745\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I call up amendment numbered 2745.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. Nelson], for himself, Mr. \n     Corzine, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Schumer, and Mr. Nelson of \n     Nebraska proposes an amendment numbered 2745.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe reading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To create a reserve fund to allow for an increase in \n   Veteran's medical care by $1.8 billion by eliminating abusive tax \n                               loopholes)\n\n       On page 3, line 9, increase the amount by $1,620,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 10, increase the amount by $162,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 11, increase the amount by $7,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 12, increase the amount by $2,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 17, increase the amount by $1,620,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 18, increase the amount by $162,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 19, increase the amount by $7,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 20, increase the amount by $2,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 20, increase the amount by $1,620,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 21, increase the amount by $162,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 22, increase the amount by $7,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 23, increase the amount by $2,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 3, decrease the amount by $1,620,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 4, decrease the amount by $1,782,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 5, decrease the amount by $1,789,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 6, decrease the amount by $1,791,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 7, decrease the amount by $1,791,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 11, decrease the amount by $1,620,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 12, decrease the amount by $1,782,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 13, decrease the amount by $1,789,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 14, decrease the amount by $1,791,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 15, decrease the amount by $1,791,000,000.\n       At the end of Title III, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   .

I ask unanimous consent Senators Corzine, \nMikulski, Schumer, and Nelson of Nebraska be added as cosponsors to my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, we have arrived at the moment \nof truth on veterans. Veterans have been all over this Capitol today \npleading their case regarding their health care. There is not one \nMember from any one of our 50 states who has not heard from veterans \nthe tales of woe, the tales of inefficiency, the tales of long waits, \nwaits as much as 6 months to get an appointment with a VA doctor to get \na prescription.\n  The way I approached this amendment was to go to the deliberations of \nthe Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee and to find and be guided by \ntheir bipartisan analysis of the Veterans' Administration budget, \nconcluding we must add $1.8 billion in order to adequately fund the \nhealth care requirements of veterans.\n  Listen to the words of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs when he \ntestified last month to the House Veterans' Affairs Committee. \nSecretary Principi said:\n  I asked for $1.2 billion more than I received.\n  In other words, even the Secretary of the VA is calling for more \nmoney.\n  The President's budget makes up the difference for these cuts in \ntrying to rely on copayments from veterans on enrollment fees. To pay, \nthe administration has tried to impose this tax--and it is a tax--on \nthe hard-earned benefits of veterans in the past, but the Congress has \nnot and is not going to allow it. We simply cannot accept a budget that \nincludes access fees and higher prescription drug copayments.\n  What this budget assumes is the number of VA patients requiring \nmental health care will decrease next year. If you believe that, you \nbelieve in the tooth fairy because the bipartisan analysis of our own \nVeterans' Affairs Committee finds no basis for this assumption and \nwholeheartedly rejects the President's $60 million cut in the funding \nfor mental health care.\n  To make matters worse on veterans health care, there are 60,000 \nveterans nationwide who have enrolled in the VA and have waited for 6 \nmonths or longer for an appointment. This is according to the Senate \nVeterans' Affairs Committee. Failure to provide more funds is going to \nresult in longer waits and a higher risk to the quality of the care.\n  Then there are a couple of other complicating factors. If anyone \nthinks because we have so many World War II veterans and because of \ntheir age their numbers are declining, think of all the veterans who \nwere deployed in our Armed Forces serving in Operation Enduring Freedom \nand Operation Iraqi Freedom: 287,000 service members have served or are \nserving in those missions. The veterans health system has struggled, to \nmake matters worse, with war-related problems from the first gulf war, \nwith hundreds of thousands of American soldiers serving on the ground, \nwhile we cannot begin to estimate future demand on the veterans health \nsystem.\n  Indeed, because of wonderful improvements in the way our military \noperates its health care on the battlefield, this present operation in \nIraq has fewer deaths. But because of the nature of the war, there are \nmany more injuries. At the end of November of last year, a few months \nago, the number of soldiers medically evacuated from Iraq was almost \n11,000, both battle and nonbattle related. This means what? It means \nour veterans are surviving at higher rates, hallelujah, but they are \ngoing to also, more likely, depend on the VA for future medical care \nrelated to those injuries.\n\n  When we look at the President's budget for the Veterans' \nAdministration, it reflects only a 1.8 percent increase in medical care \nfunding over last year's appropriation. Overall medical care inflation, \naccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, was 4 percent. So if we \nhave medical care inflation at 4 percent with the President's budget \nonly rising at something under 2 percent for veterans medical care \nfunding, where is that going to leave our veterans? We must recognize \nthe health care costs are growing more rapidly and reflect this in the \nrapid rise in the VA budget.\n  From where do I get it? I get it from tax loopholes. Since I only \nhave 10 minutes, I will not give examples of tax loopholes. If anyone \nwants these examples, they have been discussed over the course of the \nlast several days.\n  It is simple. Take the money, $1.8 billion increase for veterans \nmedical care, which is woefully, inadequately funded in the President's \nbudget and you get that out of closing tax loopholes where corporations \nare taking advantage of tax provisions that, in essence, allow them to \npay less taxes than are owed. It is a simple tradeoff. That is what I \nam proposing.\n  Why don't we do something for the veterans?\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, to advise our colleagues, it now appears \nwe will have a vote in a couple of minutes. The first will be a 15-\nminute rollcall vote, the second will be a 10-minute rollcall vote. It \nappears we will have two rollcall votes tonight. The first will be on \nthe Baucus amendment dealing with striking the reconciliation \ninstruction and the second will be an amendment by Senator Nelson.\n  If my memory serves me correctly, we voted on a similar amendment \nyesterday. I wonder how many times we will have to vote on various \nissues. This amendment is very similar to the one from yesterday in a \ncouple of respects. One, it has billions of dollars of tax increase, \nhas billions of dollars of spending, except the spending is sheltered \ninto a reserve fund so some people say this gives more money to \nveterans medical care, but it does not do that. It does not increase \nmoney to veterans medical care. It creates a fund and maybe that money \nwould go in there if the Appropriations Committee did such and such. \nBut you can count on what it does do; it increases taxes.\n  My colleague has very legitimate concerns--I share some of those \nconcerns--about veterans health care. Let me mention a couple of facts \non veterans. We are increasing the total amount of money going to \nveterans on mandatory and discretionary by 14.5 percent. I believe I \nsaid this yesterday. That is a lot, especially when you consider you \nare trying to do a budget that is almost deficit neutral.\n  We did add $1.4 billion for medical care. I understand people want \nmore. I know people wanted more even if we did not do anything. No \nmatter what we put in, they would want more because they think they are \nscoring political points.\n  I will also say we have taken total veterans function 700--mandatory \nand discretionary--from $47.5 billion in the year 2001 to $70.4 \nbillion. That is an enormous increase.\n  I understand the demands. I understand the challenge it is. But I \nurge our colleagues to vote no on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, this amendment is significantly \ndifferent from the one defeated yesterday by a very narrow vote. That \none was for a $2.7 billion increase, but it also had a commensurate \nlike reduction in the deficit, so the total amount taken out of tax \nloopholes was $5.4 billion. This amendment has only $1.8 billion taken \nout of tax loopholes to give to veterans for their medical care.\n  What easier tradeoff--we, all the time, have to make tradeoffs around \nhere--what easier tradeoff is there than to do this on tax loopholes, \nfor example, that allow a corporation to go out and buy a bridge, turn \naround and lease it back to a municipality, and because it technically \nowns the bridge, depreciate the value of that bridge? That is a sham \nkind of tax loophole, and that is the kind of stuff we can go after to \nfund, to stand up and support the men and women in uniform who have \nserved this country.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, how much time does the Senator from \nFlorida have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twelve seconds.\n\n[[Page S2531]]\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Does the Senator yield his time? I am going to order \nsome votes.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I will be happy to yield back \nthe remainder of my time, urging a vote for the veterans of this \ncountry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, we are ready to begin voting. We are \ngoing to have two votes tonight.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 2705 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw \namendment No. 2705.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Ohio. He is my \nvery good friend. He makes some excellent points. I compliment him. He \nis what I call a deficit hawk, and I compliment him.\n  I look forward to working with him on a lot of ideas. Some of his \nideas are in this resolution. Some of his ideas for budget reform were \nin last year's resolution. I will remind my colleague from Ohio, we \nused some of your budget points of order you suggested to me over a \nyear ago, this year, throughout the year, to save a lot of spending.\n  I compliment my colleague from Ohio for his work, and I look forward \nto continuing to work with him.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2751\n\n  Mr. President, we are now ready to vote, first on the Baucus \namendment. I expect it will be a 15-minute rollcall vote. I do not \nexpect to let it go much beyond 15 minutes. I ask unanimous consent to \nhave the second rollcall vote be limited to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of our time.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on the Baucus amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  Without objection, the question will first occur on the Baucus \namendment.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 2751.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, that is the last vote tonight. I believe \nSenator Corzine has an amendment he is going to lay down. We will \npossibly discuss it tonight. I believe he wants to discuss it a little \nbit, I am not sure. I have to see what the amendment is. I am not sure \nwhat it is.\n  I don't know if there are any other amendments that will be \nintroduced tonight. But I want to let all our colleagues know we are \ngoing to be starting pretty early tomorrow, and we will have a lot of \nvotes. My guesstimate is I will yield back a lot of time so we will be \non amendments tomorrow. We handled a lot of amendments today. I haven't \ncounted the number. We accepted some, we disposed of some, but\n\n[[Page S2532]]\n\nwe are going to have a lot more amendments tomorrow night, and tomorrow \nnight we are probably going to be working a lot past 10 o'clock. I \nregret that. I would love to change the way budgets are done.\n  I urge our colleagues, not all these amendments have to be offered. I \nurge our colleagues if you have amendments, if you can work them out \nwith Senator Conrad and myself, we are happy to try to do that. That \nmight save a lot of time. Rollcalls take a lot of time. We still \nconduct rollcalls the way it was done 200-some-odd years ago. It takes \na little while, and that is fine. But I encourage our colleagues to \nthink of the major amendments we really need to vote on, that they feel \ncompelled to vote on, and we will try to have those together and give \neverybody a fair crack at amending this budget resolution.\n  I hope some of our colleagues, if they have had success in passing an \namendment, maybe they would consider voting for the resolution, not \njust trying to tear the resolution down or change it and continue to \noppose it.\n  Anyway, I urge our colleagues tomorrow to expect a long day with a \nlot of votes. Maybe we can conclude tomorrow night. More than likely we \nwill conclude sometime on Friday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I add my voice to the chairman's and \nindicate to our colleagues we have now been able to substantially \nreduce the list on our side. I report to the chairman a very \nsubstantial reduction. I think we have eliminated, now, more than 50 of \nthe amendments that have been noticed. But that still leaves us with \nover 40.\n  At three amendments an hour, that would be 13 hours of straight \nvoting. It is not just going to be straight voting because we still \nhave time on the resolution. We still have eight or nine amendments \nthat are going to require more extended time during the day, before we \nget to vote-arama.\n  I think, just eyeballing it, we are probably talking 4 hours before \nwe get to vote-arama. Then we have at least, as I have indicated, 13 \nhours of votes after that, if people do not back off and show \nrestraint.\n  We have the night. We have the night to think very carefully about \nwhat kind of quality of life we want for ourselves over the next 2 \ndays.\n  We have had very significant debates, significant amendments. Let's \ntry to close this out and do it in a way that has the dignity the \nSenate should have. Yes, we will have significant additional amendments \nand debate, but let's eliminate the duplication and try to have a \nreasonable number of amendments so we can be done by a reasonable time \non Friday.\n  I thank the chairman for working with me as we have to try to move \nthis process.\n  I also thank very much Senator Corzine, who is a very valuable member \nof the committee, who has been extraordinarily patient. We almost \nachieved a unanimous consent that would have allowed his amendment to \nbe voted on this evening. It did not happen. I thank him personally for \nhis patience and his graciousness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I compliment both the chairman and the \nranking member for their leadership in this debate. I hope people \nunderstand how civil and effective the views in the debate have been \ncarried forward. They will be pleased to know we have pulled the other \nthree amendments I submitted.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank my colleague.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2777\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. With that, Mr. President, I send an amendment to the \ndesk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Corzine] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2777.\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To eliminate tax breaks for those with incomes greater than \n  $1 million and reserve the savings to prevent future cuts in Social \n                           Security benefits)\n\n       On page 3, line 9, increase the amount by $20,000,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 10, increase the amount by $31,000,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 11, increase the amount by $34,000,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 12, increase the amount by $39,000,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 13, increase the amount by $36,000,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 17, increase the amount by $20,000,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 18, increase the amount by $31,000,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 19, increase the amount by $24,000,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 20, increase the amount by $39,000,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 21, increase the amount by $36,000,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 20, increase the amount by $20,000,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 21, increase the amount by $31,000,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 22, increase the amount by $34,000,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 23, increase the amount by $39,000,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 24, increase the amount by $36,000,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 3, decrease the amount by $20,000,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 4, decrease the amount by $31,000,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 5, decrease the amount by $34,000,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 6, decrease the amount by $39,000,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 7, decrease the amount by $36,000,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 11, decrease the amount by $20,000,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 12, decrease the amount by $31,000,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 13, decrease the amount by $34,000,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 14, decrease the amount by $39,000,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 15, decrease the amount by $36,000,000,000.\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       ``Sec.   . Reserve Fund To Prevent Cuts in Social Security \n     Benefits.--If legislation is reported by the Senate Committee \n     on Finance, or an amendment thereto is offered or a \n     conference report thereon is submitted that would extend the \n     solvency of the Social Security Trust Funds and prevent \n     future cuts in Social Security benefits, the Chairman of the \n     Senate Committee on the Budget may revise the aggregates, \n     allocations, and other appropriate levels and limits in this \n     resolution by not more than $160,000,000,000 to reflect such \n     legislation.''\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, this is an amendment that is very simple \nin nature. It calls for the elimination of tax breaks for those with \nincomes greater than $1 million, that is less than two-tenths of 1 \npercent of income-tax payers in the United States with incomes greater \nthan $1 million, and reserves the savings for the Social Security fund. \nI emphasize that is two-tenths of American taxpayers, basically setting \na new bracket, returning it to 39.5 percent for those who have adjusted \ngross income over $1 million.\n  The amendment uses the savings to establish a reserve fund for Social \nSecurity which would be used only to extend the solvency of the Social \nSecurity trust fund and prevent future cuts in Social Security \nbenefits. It is straightforward.\n  Social Security represents the best of America's values. It promises \nall Americans, if you work hard, pay your taxes, play by the rules, you \ncan live out your life in dignity. Social Security is not a handout. It \nis not welfare. It is an earned benefit. It honors and rewards work, a \nbasic American value. The promise of Social Security, when you get \nright down to it, is a guaranteed promise of retirement security. \nRegardless of how long you live, regardless of the rate of inflation, \nregardless of the state of the economy or the state of the stock \nmarket, you worked all your life, you contributed to our Nation's \nproductivity. Social Security promises you will have enough to have \ndignity in your senior years.\n  In fact, the benefits promised by Social Security are quite modest. \nThe average monthly benefit is about $900; $900 per month for a senior. \nI don't think, at least not in New Jersey--that is not exactly \nluxurious living that one would be benefiting from, from Social \nSecurity. But it does provide an important safety net.\n  For nearly one-third of the seniors in retirement, it is at least 90 \npercent of their income or more--one-third. For another one-third it is \n50 percent or more of their retirement security. And for the balance, \nit is a major support, that third third; it is a little less than 50 \npercent but a significant part of their retirement security.\n\n[[Page S2533]]\n\n  As a result of Social Security, the poverty rate among seniors today \nis less than 10 percent. It is actually about 9 percent. Without the \nprogram, nearly half of all retirees would live below the poverty \nlevel--48 percent is what the calculations would be--which, by the way, \nis where seniors were before the institution of Social Security. It has \nprovided a major support for the quality of life for America's seniors.\n  We hear a lot of conversation around here about the problems facing \nSocial Security. Let me first say that talk is way overblown. Even if \nCongress does nothing, the Social Security system is secure and solvent \nto 2042. After that date, a substantial portion of benefits could \ncontinue--about 75 percent, I guess, according to the actuaries.\n  That said, we all have a responsibility to address the long-term \nsolvency problem of Social Security. It is not in crisis, but it needs \nto be addressed. It is better to deal with it earlier rather than \nlater. That is one of the reasons I believe my amendment makes sense. \nIf we get started on that process now, we can protect seniors as time \ngoes forward.\n  The Social Security trust fund faces a long-term shortfall. The last \n30 years of the trust fund needs to be addressed. We ought to be \npreparing for it. That is what I am trying to talk about.\n  Given the angst that so many people in the country have with regard \nto Social Security, the President proposed a very radical reform \nprogram which we heard about in the State of the Union. It is something \nI think we ought to start putting money aside for now to protect our \nseniors as we go forward.\n  The reality is that this budget resolution does nothing to preserve \nor save Social Security. That is why I think it is so important that we \naddress it. This is one of those means to do it.\n  Actually, this budget resolution in many ways will make the problem \nworse. This budget resolution takes every penny out of the Social \nSecurity trust fund and spends it either on funding additional tax cuts \nor spending it on other programs, depending on how you look at it. But \nthe fact is, over the next 10 years we are going to--if we don't \neliminate tax cuts or some portion of it--use $2.5 trillion. That is \nthe cost of the Bush tax cuts over the next 10 years. That is almost \ndollar per dollar what would be coming into the Social Security trust \nfund over the period of time ahead. That is what the excess is. Almost \ndollar for dollar, we match the funding of those tax cuts and use up \nthe Social Security trust fund. I don't think that is what the American \npeople had in mind. I know they don't have in mind running this country \ndeeper and deeper into debt. In fact, this budget resolution continues \nwhat this Congress and this President have done over recent years, \nwhich is absolute abandonment of fiscal discipline.\n  For the year 2005, the majority is proposing that the Government run \na deficit of more than $512 billion with this resolution. That is the \nfull on-budget element, and I think it is very hard to argue it is \nfiscally responsible. In fact, I consider that a pretty egregious \nfigure hardly reflecting the kind of fiscal responsibility we all seem \nto hold close to our chests. Even that figure is misleading because it \nexcludes known costs such as the cost of addressing the alternative \nminimum tax beyond 2005; similarly, the cost of our continued presence \nin Afghanistan and Iraq after 2005.\n  By the way, I compliment the chairman and others for putting together \na resolution that actually acknowledges there will be additional \nexpenditures. But I don't think we have addressed it.\n  Most importantly, we are not addressing, and there is no allowance \nfor, the provisions that are embedded in Social Security reform that is \ntalked about both by the President and many of those on the other side \nof the aisle.\n  Everyone knows that the total cost of the transition to private \naccounts, which is so readily embraced by many, will be over $1 \ntrillion and that nothing is allowed in this budget for the beginning \nof that transition. I think it is even more aggravated with regard to \nwhere we will end up relative to what the reflected budget deficit is \nthat is included. I think it will be considerably larger.\n\n  We are fooling ourselves if we think that running such deficits comes \nwithout a cost. In the long run, these deficits will have a substantial \nimpact on our economy and on every American family.\n  In January of 2001, the Congressional Budget Office projected that by \nthe end of 10 years we would have $36 billion in publicly held debt. \nInstead, today we are looking at a projection of $5.5 trillion by 2008. \nIt is a rather significant swing in cashflow by this country. It calls \ninto question whether we are really thinking about the long-run impact \nthis is going to have on our Nation. Our level of national savings will \ngo down, interest costs will go up, investment will go down, and the \nend result is likely to be a reduced standard of living in the long \nterm for all Americans.\n  There is one thing that is absolutely certain in this context, and \nthat is the certainty that every American will be carrying the debt \nburden that goes well beyond where we are today, which is about $24,000 \nper person and up to about $35,000 just in 2009. I hate to see how this \nexplodes over the longer period of time because we have all seen the \ncharts about how deficits grow as the baby boomers retire. We have a \nreal problem. It is going to undermine the quality and level of \nstandard of living in America through a period of time.\n  That is why I believe we need to revisit at least some of the huge \ntax breaks enacted in recent years. Over the next 75 years, the cost of \nthe Bush tax cuts is about $12 trillion in present value terms. By \ncontrast, the amount needed to ensure the long-term solvency of Social \nSecurity is less than $4 trillion. This is what the tax cuts cost for \n75 years. This is how much it costs to fix Social Security, according \nto the actuarials. In other words, those tax cuts cost more than three \ntimes the entire Social Security shortfall.\n  What will happen if we make the tax cuts permanent, as the President \nwants? It is a real problem in our capacity to fix this problem; by the \nway, Medicare as well. It will lead inevitably to benefit cuts in \nSocial Security, and more than likely will be dealt with quite deeply.\n  Many of us, by the way, have thought and long suspected that the \nrising deficits of recent years have been no accident but rather part \nof a strategy designed to force deep cuts in Social Security and \nMedicare to change the basic underlying fix of the social safety net we \nhave in this country.\n  Recently, it became a little more clear in a lot of people's minds \nexactly what is going on here. No less a figure than the Federal \nReserve Chairman, Alan Greenspan, came out and publicly stated it is \ntime to do two things: make permanent tax breaks which go largely to \nthose doing the most well in our society, or make significant cuts--\nlong run cuts--in Social Security benefits. No doubt many politicians \nwho believe in such an approach were hoping to defer this debate until \nafter the election. But I think we need to have that debate out in the \npublic and fully understood.\n  I compliment Chairman Greenspan for at least raising this issue so it \nis on the table. I don't necessarily agree with the strategy of \nexecution, of making permanent these tax cuts which undermine our \nability to deal with it, but I think it is absolutely one we need to \ndebate.\n  We need to be saving today to make sure we can protect those benefits \nfor tomorrow. We can't do it if we are going to continue to live with \nthis absolute binge of tax cuts, especially for the most fortunate. Yet \nthat is what this resolution proposes. That is why I feel so strongly \nwe should take steps to try to address something that is so fundamental \nto the American people.\n  My amendment proposes to limit those tax breaks that go to those with \nincomes greater than $1 million.\n  By the way, just returning to the tax bracket at the very high end, \n.2 percent of the American taxpayers use those savings to establish a \nSocial Security reserve fund. The fund would be available only for \nlegislation to extend the solvency of the Social Security trust fund \nand to prevent future benefit cuts. This would not entirely save Social \nSecurity's long-term challenge. Roughly $4 trillion is what we have, \nbut it is a heck of a downpayment. It is about $1 trillion on the \npresent value basis in the direction of a big step towards trying to \npreserve and make sure we can deal with the Social Security shortfall \nover a period of time.\n\n[[Page S2534]]\n\n  Again, let me recap why this amendment is so important. Social \nSecurity is a promise we must keep. It is a promise millions of hard-\nworking Americans will depend on to keep them out of poverty in their \nold age. Keeping that promise in the future will require increasing our \nsavings now. That is why we cannot afford to build massive deficits \nwith huge new tax breaks for the most fortunate Americans among us.\n  We need to be disciplined. We need to be responsible. This amendment \nsays instead of going deeper and deeper into debt, let's save a portion \nfor the future. Let's hold off on tax breaks for those with incomes \ngreater than $1 million so we can keep our promise to Social Security \nand prevent future benefit cuts for our seniors as the years go on.\n  That is the right thing to do. It is the responsible thing to do. I \nhope the majority of my colleagues will support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CORZINE. Certainly.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I am trying to figure out how the amendment would work. \nYou are assuming the highest income level people would have no \nreduction in their tax rates going back to 2001, so their personal \nincome tax rate would be 39.6 percent?\n  Mr. CORZINE. The Senator is right, except for the 2001. It is moving \nback up to the 39.6 percent rate for those over $1 million.\n  Mr. NICKLES. If the Senator will yield further, would that include \nthe rate on capital gains?\n  Mr. CORZINE. It would.\n  Mr. NICKLES. And the rate on dividends?\n  Mr. CORZINE. It would.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I have great respect for my colleague \nfrom New Jersey, but this is one of the worst amendments I have seen. \nThis is a tax increase of $160 billion. The Senator from New Jersey can \nassume it will only be on millionaires, but you cannot do that. \nTherefore, it is a direction to the Finance Committee to raise $160 \nbillion. It assumes it would be saving Social Security, but it will \nnot. It will not in any way, shape, or form. He assumes it will be put \ninto a trust fund to save Social Security, but it will not. It raises \ntaxes $160 billion.\n  I will talk about, if he was correct, how bad that would be. It would \nbe kind of interesting to say everyone in the country gets a capital \ngain rate of 15 percent, but if you happen to be at an income level of \nsuch and such, your capital gain rate is twice as high; it is 39.6 \npercent. That is very strange.\n  I assume, too, if you had dividend rates now and we set them now at \n15 percent, and that helped the market a lot, and we tax dividends \nhigher than any other country in the world, but we helped that in last \nyear's bill by cutting dividends to 15 percent, and you say dividends \nwill be taxed for everybody in the country at 15 percent except for the \nhighest income people, that will be at 39.6 percent, you are getting \ninto a mess as far as administering the Tax Code.\n  What about this instruction to increase it $160 billion? How does \nthat save Social Security? I tell my colleagues, Social Security has a \n$4.9 trillion unfunded liability. If this makes sense to do it to \nSocial Security, the unfunded liability over 75 years for Medicare is 3 \nor 4 times as high. The last estimate I had was $15.3 trillion for \nMedicare. We made it worse last year when we expanded the Medicare \nbenefits.\n\n  First, if we went with the amendment's assumption, you would be \nincreasing the maximum rate at least to 39.6 percent. The maximum rate \non corporations is 35 percent. So why would we tax individuals who \nhappen to be proprietors, who own their own business, who happen to be \nthe individuals who are creating about 80 percent of the jobs, and \nprobably 80 percent of the people who pay maximum rates are \nindividuals, self-employed proprietors, maybe doctors and lawyers, \nhiring a lot of people, but we will tax them higher rates than we tax \nExxon and we tax Goldman Sachs, the corporation. They pay 35 percent, \nbut we will say we will have these individuals pay an additional tax up \nto 39.6 percent, and then to say we will put it into a fund, that just \nwill not work.\n  What we would do, the net essence, is raise taxes $160 billion. \nPresumably we will put it into a fund, but with the deficit situation \nwe have right now it will be spent. It is absurd to think it would not \nbe spent. It will be spent.\n  You might have an IOU in that fund, but if the Government collects \nthe taxes--I made this speech yesterday; I don't want to be redundant, \nespecially this late--all money will go into one pot, and if you want \nto have a little paper entry that says IOU over here and you have \nanother fund that says IOU, and someone assumes it is to pay Social \nSecurity, that is not the way it works. It would not work that way.\n  I appreciate my colleague's amendment. I hope our colleagues would \nvote no on this amendment to raise taxes by $160 billion on a lot of \nsmall business entrepreneurs throughout the country. I think it would \nbe slamming the door on economic recovery right off the bat. I urge our \ncolleagues to vote no. We will vote on this amendment tomorrow morning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Madam President, would the chairman acknowledge the $160 \nbillion is only for 5 years? If you were to implement this policy over \nthe full 75-year timeframe, the present value would be roughly $1 \ntrillion. My calculation is not down to the last decimal point. But the \npoint being not that $160 billion will save Social Security, nor $1 \ntrillion, but doesn't the Senator think we ought to be making steps, \neven if it is not this approach, to begin to address these shortfalls \nas we go forward?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I don't think this economy needs a big \ntax increase. I have not figured out percentagewise what it would be if \nyou applied it to upper income, but it is an increase of about 15 \npercent, I guess maybe 14 percent on some of the most productive people \nwe have in the country.\n  That is a good way to encourage a lot of people to go overseas. That \nis a good way to encourage more business in other areas. That is a good \nreason for people to outsource more to other countries that do not have \ntax rates this high.\n  I find this to be very shortsighted. This is a big tax increase. It \nwould not be funneled into Social Security. If you want to do that, \nincrease the payroll tax. Some people think we will save Social \nSecurity by increasing some people's income tax. That is not my \nopinion. Very shortsighted. We pay Social Security right now. It is \nbasically an unfunded, defined benefit plan. It is a rollover type \nplan, money coming in, money going out. Right now a little more is \ngoing in than going out, but there is significant liability. It has \nnever been a funded, vested plan. It is basically a pay-go system, paid \nfor under the payroll system.\n\n  Some think it should be changed. I happen to think maybe it should be \nchanged in line with what the President suggested, where we move it \nfrom a defined benefit to a defined benefit plus a defined contribution \nplan; where we allow individuals to take a percentage of their payroll \nand put it in their own bank account where they own it and they control \nit and they are not dependent on Government promises to provide future \nbenefits.\n  That is a debate for another day. That would help save the system. I \nused to be a trustee of a private pension system. Our system, like \nmillions across America, moved away from a defined benefit system to a \ndefined contribution system. Federal employees have done the same \nthing. Frankly, that will continue happening and will continue \nhappening. We need to let individuals have the opportunity to grow, \nown, invest, and control part of their retirement funds, including \nSocial Security retirement funds.\n  This, however, is not that solution. This is a solution that says \nlet's not only have the payroll tax--and I might mention, the payroll \ntax is already very large. The payroll tax of Social Security is 12.4 \npercent of payroll. Matching employee and employer, 6.2, 6.2, 12.4 \npercent of all payroll going up to 87,000 is paid into Social Security. \nThat is a lot. That is thousands and thousands of dollars.\n  Incidentally, the individuals get a crummy deal because they have to \npay\n\n[[Page S2535]]\n\ntaxes on it before they make their contribution. So they have to use \naftertax dollars to make their Social Security contribution.\n  This is not a great deal for individuals. They can do a lot better if \nthey were able to invest some of their own money in their own accounts, \nand let it grow--hopefully, grow tax free--so they would not be so \ndependent on Government.\n  This solution says, let's have not only the payroll taxes and the \ndemographic challenge that we have with payroll taxes--because right \nnow you are going to have a lot more people drawing the benefits and \nfewer people paying as the baby boomers retire--but let's create a tax \nsurcharge or an income tax just on a very small percentage and really \nsock it to them. And we will say we are putting that into a fund.\n  All that fund would be used for would be to maybe reduce debt or \nmaybe finance more spending. The direction in this amendment is: Well, \nlet's create a fund. Basically, the Finance Committee might create a \nfund, but there are going to be more taxes raised. It would be a $160 \nbillion tax increase over the next 5 years.\n  I do not doubt my colleague from New Jersey; it may be $1 trillion \nover the next umpteen years. I think it would be very shortsighted \neconomic policy.\n  Marginal rates make a difference. I used to run a manufacturing \ncompany. I used to have a janitor service. Marginal rates made a \ndifference when I had a janitor service because I found out I was \nworking just as much for the Government as I was for myself. And why \nwould you build or expand?\n  The Senator's amendment would move us very close to 40 percent, not \ncounting State income tax, not counting city income tax, if you happen \nto live in some cities. If you add all that together, people will say: \nWhy should I grow, build, or expand? If they do not expand, they are \nnot creating jobs. This is a very bad amendment if you want to grow the \neconomy.\n  The real future of Social Security is going to be dependent on a \ngrowing economy. This amendment would be sending the signal we are not \ninterested in growing; we would rather have you leave.\n  So I urge my colleagues to vote no on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Madam President, I would like to make just a couple \nobservations relative to the views of the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The last time I checked, when marginal rates were 39.6 percent for a \nwhole wider range of Americans--and I do believe marginal rates and \nlarge increments do make a difference on the motivation to work--the \neconomy grew for 8 straight years, producing 22.5 million jobs. We had \n4, 5 percent productivity, the highest growth in small business in the \nhistory of the country.\n  It is hard for one to imagine just exactly how that marginal rate \nended up being so dampening to economic growth given the reality of the \neconomy's performance in the 1990s. And now what we are talking about \nwith this suggestion applies to two-tenths of 1 percent of taxpayers.\n  I would also suggest that there are many differentials already in the \nTax Code with regard to tax payments on dividends. It is not a flat \napplication of the dividend rate for all businesses. So there are many \ncircumstances where you could end up having a differential of rates.\n  I think the choice that we are making here is: Is it worthwhile to \nprotect guaranteed benefits--again, where one-third of Americans now \nare 100 percent dependent on Social Security as their sole protection \nfor their senior years and another third are 50 percent or more \ndependent? Do we want to continue to have a social safety net, a \nguaranteed benefit for Americans? I think that is a compact and a trust \nwe put together.\n  This is one of the ways that we can begin to address it: a $1 \ntrillion present-value step, if we were to implement it. So I hope my \ncolleagues will take into account whether we want to maintain Social \nSecurity with its guaranteed benefit structure or are we going to put \nourselves at risk, having to change that program because we do not have \nthe long-term actuarial protection of the ability to fulfill the \nobligations that are accumulating by Americans who work, the \nfundamental value that we take on here.\n  The folks from the State that I call home tell me that Social \nSecurity is vital to their long-term security. And I hear from those \nfolks that they would like to see a program that is not at risk, but \nthey want to maintain that guaranteed benefit.\n  This is one of those steps we can take to make that happen.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, I have just a couple thoughts to share \ntonight on the Senator's amendment and on Social Security in general.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma mentioned what the Senator's amendment \nwould actually do: raise taxes, supposedly to put into a fund to save \nSocial Security.\n  First of all, it directs the Finance Committee to raise taxes. You \ncannot tell the Finance Committee, in a budget resolution, what taxes \nto raise. It could easily raise taxes on the child tax credit. It could \neasily raise whatever taxes it chooses to raise. You cannot direct the \nFinance Committee on what taxes to raise. We all know that.\n  Any of the amendments that have been put forward today that say, \nwell, just raise the tax on millionaires, you have to be on the Finance \nCommittee to be able to direct that. That may be your desire, but that \nis not the way the budget resolution works. You can just direct the \namount of money for the Finance Committee to raise. And I think the \nSenator from New Jersey is aware of that.\n  As far as putting it in a fund, this Senator has only been here for 3 \nyears. I was in the House of Representatives for 4 years prior to this. \nThe one thing I have learned around here, first of all, is that there \nis no Social Security trust fund; it is a bunch of IOUs. It is simply \nan accounting system that we have. Taxpayers, basically in the future, \nwill pay taxes to fund this accounting gimmick that we know as a trust \nfund.\n  In most companies, the way they set up trust funds, they actually \ntake the money and invest it. That money accumulates. There are \nactually real assets. There are not real assets, other than the word of \nthe United States, in the Social Security trust fund. That is really \nall we have.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Let me make a few points, and then I will be happy to \nyield.\n  There is no cash. There are Treasury bills, basically financing debt \nthat we have for the long term. And we get a very low rate of interest \non those for the Social Security trust fund.\n  The pension systems of companies and States have real assets in them. \nThe State of Nevada has the Public Employees Retirement System. It is a \nsystem that a lot of States have.\n  Most teachers, police officers, and the like are not in the Social \nSecurity system because they are in a pension system. The easiest way \nto explain that is, instead of the taxpayers of today paying for the \nretirees of today, the retirees' money that they earned while working \ngot put in a system that earned money, so that when they retired they \nstarted getting that money back out with interest.\n  For retirees of today under Social Security, theirs was put in a \npaper account. It has earned a tiny amount of interest, but the workers \nof today pay in taxes for their retirement payments. That is how it \nworks. It is a complete difference.\n  By the way, for the State of Nevada, since we have had our PERS \nsystem--I think for 25 or 30 years, whatever it has been--the average \nrate of return has been 11 percent. Social Security is about 2, 3 \npercent, somewhere in there--1 percent. It is a lot lower, we know, \nthan 11 percent.\n  If Social Security would have been set up as a retirement system, as \na pension system with real assets, what the Senator is trying to do--\nput money into that system--may work. But it is not set up that way.\n  It is set up as a pay-as-you-go system. All this money you give to \nCongress today, they will spend it. I have been around here 3 years, \nbut it is obvious: If you give more money to this Government, it is \ngoing to spend it. It\n\n[[Page S2536]]\n\nis an easy way to get reelected, just giving money to people.\n  So while the Senator from New Jersey wants to put it in to save \nSocial Security, it is not going to do that.\n  As a matter of fact, it will raise the baseline which will put more \nliability into the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, if I might ask the Senator from Nevada a \nsimple definitional question, I think government bonds and treasury \nbills are assets. They may not be as high yield assets as those \navailable to the investment profile that is the Nevada PERS fund, but \nthen again, it is also an asset that provides presumably greater \nsecurity and less volatility and less risk to those who would benefit \nfrom it down the road. Social Security, while it has pay-as-you-go \ncharacteristics, has never been a system that was without accumulated \nreserves or deficient reserves.\n  There is a time for us to have a debate about Social Security that \ngoes further than we do tonight, but my view is if we reduce the amount \nof borrowings that are taken out of the Social Security trust fund to \nfund everything else we do in government, we would be a lot safer in \nthe long run, and that is what my amendment is really to accomplish.\n  The reserve is going to lower actually the amount of borrowing the \nFederal Government has to do.\n  I think it is up to us to express the self-discipline of not having \nunlimited tax cuts and also discipline with regard to spending. It is \nnot just on the spending side that we have shown a lack of discipline \nthat has allowed us to get to $5.5 trillion of publicly held debt.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. If I may respond to the Senator from New Jersey, first of \nall, we have a difference of philosophy. The ranking member on the \nBudget Committee and I had this discussion last night. There is a \ndifference in philosophy. This Senator believes in cutting tax rates, \ngiving entrepreneurs more of their own money. For instance, when I was \npracticing as a veterinarian, I was a sole proprietor. If I wanted to \nexpand my business, I looked at my costs, and I looked at rate of \nreturn. Part of that was taxes. Could I justify expanding my business. \nI looked at the cost of borrowing. I looked at the cost of taxes. I \nlooked at all those variables. The higher you raise the cost of taxes, \nthe less expansion of business you are going to get, the fewer jobs you \nare going to create.\n  While we have to have tax rates that allow what we believe in to be \nfunded, there is a balance there. I believe if we raise taxes, as you \nare suggesting, especially as fragile as this economy and this economic \nrecovery is, it could send us back into a double-dip recession as we \nhave seen this economy do historically several times.\n  I think raising taxes would actually threaten the Social Security \ntrust fund because, as the Senator from Oklahoma said, the only real \nsecurity for the Social Security trust fund as it is set up today is a \nstrong economy.\n  We have the baby boomers who are retiring, this huge demographic \nshift. When Social Security was first set up, there were 39 workers for \nevery one retiree. The retirement age was 65. The average age when \npeople died was 63. That is why a pay-as-you-go system worked for all \nthose years. We had plenty of workers to pay for the retirees. We are \ndown to less than four workers for every one retiree today. We are \ngoing to two to one. In future years, if we continue with the birth \nrates and the increase in age that people live, we will be down to one \nto one. A pay-as-you-go system does not work in that regard.\n\n  It is an important debate to have. I realize we are not going to \nsolve this on the budget resolution, but the bottom line is, a strong \neconomy is the only way in a pay-as-you-go system, a growing, strong, \nhealthy economy is the only way for you to be able to have enough \nrevenues coming into the Federal Government to be able to pay Social \nSecurity retirees.\n  If we want to change the system, and I believe in changing the \nsystem, keep it the way we have now, but for the future having similar \nprivate accounts, whether it is like we have a Nevada PERS or whatever \nit is, to where you have real assets that are returning a better rate \nof return that many other countries in the world are changing their \nSocial Security systems into, if we have that, that is a better way for \nthe long-term solvency for Social Security, in this Senator's opinion. \nBut the current system would be threatened by the amendment of the \nSenator from New Jersey because we are in the situation of a fragile \neconomy, and tax increases could send us into a double-dip recession.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I express my support for the budget \nresolution.\n  We have seen tough economic times take jobs from the average \nAmerican. We have seen new spending in the face of terrorism and war \nincrease the deficit. Today we respond with a budget resolution that \nwill set the correct tone for our country.\n  We now see that the President's tax cuts we passed in 2001 and 2003 \nare jumpstarting the American economy and providing us with some \npositive movement in job creation. This budget will extend the tax \nreductions that have fueled our economy and have helped the average \nAmerican worker.\n  Thanks to this budget resolution, we will reduce the deficit by $139 \nbillion to a total deficit of $338 billion in 2005. Our reductions \nfollow the President's plan to cut the deficit as a percentage of our \neconomy in half by 2006. We will hold the line with an $814 billion cap \non discretionary spending and even decrease mandatory spending by $5.7 \nbillion.\n  This budget is a blueprint for America tomorrow that recognizes the \nrealities of today. Those realities call for strong budgets for our \nmilitary and for the State Department. There are real threats on the \nhorizon that we cannot ignore. We must have the manpower, \ninfrastructure, and intelligence network to protect all Americans from \nthe threat of terrorism. We cannot afford to lose sight of the \nimportance of these programs.\n  Of course, spending more in the budget to protect Americans means \nthat some other worthy programs will have to face a little belt-\ntightening. But as we review our spending levels, we have an \nopportunity to allocate some new monies and focus on new priorities.\n\n  One such program is the Pell Grant program. Since 2001, Pell Grant \nfunding has increased by 47 percent. In committee, I was able to amend \nthe budget resolution to increase Pell Grants for students who are \nwilling to work harder in high school. This $33 million program will \nallow students who participate in a ``State Scholars Program'' to \nreceive an extra $1,000 for their college education.\n  We will seek out those students who work harder and strive for better \ncollege preparation from their high school education and reward them \nwith more money for college. Motivating our young Americans to learn \ntoday will create a skilled workforce tomorrow.\n  Another area we have expanded is veteran's medical research. The \nBudget Committee unanimously agreed to my amendment to add $536 million \nin funding over 5 years for veteran's medical and prosthetic research. \nThat is a 25 percent increase in fiscal year 2005 funding over this \nyear's level.\n  We owe it to the men and women of the armed forces to expand these \nprograms. And breakthroughs in medical research funded by this program \nwill benefit all Americans, not just those in uniform.\n  But one of the most important provisions this budget addresses is the \ntax cuts we have fought so hard to enact over the last few years. We \nhave to stop the average American from getting a tax increase next \nyear. That is why this budget will extend several provisions that are \nset to expire at the end of this year, including the $1,000 per child \ntax credit, the 10 percent income tax bracket expansion, and marriage \npenalty relief.\n  We passed these tax cuts to help the American family. And just as \nAmerica is finally getting back on track and creating new jobs, we \ncan't throw the weight of a tax increase on the shoulders of working \nAmericans.\n  This budget offers responsible spending, protects the tax cuts that \nhave stimulated our economy, and cuts the deficit. We have taken a hard \nlook at our priorities and how we can help the\n\n[[Page S2537]]\n\neconomy. But we're getting stiff resistance from across the aisle. They \nhave attacked these needed tax cut extensions and sensible spending \npolicies.\n  But they offer no constructive criticism or alternative solutions. \nThey just throw rocks and complain about our budget proposal. When they \nran the Budget Committee, they couldn't even get a budget that could \npass on the floor of the Senate.\n  We also hear complaints about Social Security. Where is their plan to \ngrapple with the future of Social Security? Where were they when the \nClinton budgets ``spent'' the Social Security Surplus?\n  As our Budget Committee chairman said this morning, this budget will \ntreat Social Security exactly the same as past budgets. The trust fund \nbalances are available for future benefit payments, just as they were \ndescribed in the fiscal year 2000 Clinton budget, which said, ``they do \nnot consist of real economic assets that can be drawn down in the \nfuture to fund benefits.'' We'll keep our Social Security money in \ntreasury bills just as we always have and in fact, are required to do \nby law.\n  I am ready to tackle the problems Social Security will face in the \nnext several decades. I, unlike many who just complain about the \nproblem, have spent a lot of time thinking about Social Security, \nparticularly during my time as chairman of the Social Security \nsubcommittee in the House. In the past, I have even drafted and \nintroduced an option for improving the system. Very few can say that. \nAll can complain, but few are willing to be constructive.\n  I hope my colleagues can look past the partisan bias and rhetoric \ncoming from some across the aisle. We drafted in the Budget Committee a \nserious proposal that addresses spending levels and our economy.\n  I support this budget before us today because it recognizes the \nrealities of our world, the necessity to limit spending, and the \nimportance of creating jobs and keeping the average American on the \nroad to economic recovery. I urge my colleagues to support the budget \nresolution before us.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, as the Senate considers the fiscal \nyear 2005 Federal budget, I want to address what I believe are the \ndeeply misplaced priorities of the Republican budget plan and the \ndangerous fiscal course facing the Nation.\n  In 3 short years, the Nation's fiscal health has deteriorated to the \npoint of turning a record budget surplus of $236 billion in 2001 to a \ngapping projected budget deficit of $477 billion. Instead of working to \nsteady the country's fiscal condition, the budget plan the U.S. Senate \nis considering will contribute an additional $179 billion to the \nFederal budget deficit over the next 5 years by permanently extending \ntax cuts for the richest one percent of American taxpayers.\n  There is another approach. It is an approach that strengthens the \nfiscal integrity of the government, while addressing the pressing needs \nof the 40 million Americans without health insurance, ensuring the \nsolvency of the Social Security trust fund, as well safeguarding the \nhomeland.\n  On Thursday, March 4, on a party line vote, the Senate Budget \nCommittee approved a budget that adheres too closely to the President's \nbudget plan and sets the wrong priorities for securing the homeland, \ncreating the conditions for job growth, and tackling the out-of-control \nFederal budget deficit. Under the budget plan the Senate is \nconsidering, the Federal budget deficit would actually increase $179 \nbillion above the Congressional Budget Office CBO baseline. To \nforestall a further run-up on the government's credit card, the Senate \nshould amend the Republican budget plan by identifying a combination of \nspending reductions and increases in revenues that will achieve the \ngoals of reducing deficits and strengthening the economy.\n  In 2001, President Bush pushed through a sweeping tax cut on the \nrationale that the historic budget surpluses built up during the \nClinton administration justified reductions in taxes. At that time, the \nFederal budget was at a record budget surplus of $236 billion and I, \nalong with many of my colleagues in the Senate, agreed that taxes \nshould be reduced. Now that the fiscal condition of the country has \nswung deep into the red, it is necessary and prudent to reevaluate \npermanently extending tax breaks for the highest income levels. Such an \napproach, in combination with focused spending discipline, could reduce \nthe deficit that threatens the long-term fiscal health of our country.\n  Instead of pursuing this approach, President Bush is asking Congress \nto make permanent the tax cuts that have put us in this situation. \nSince the United States is already in red ink, obviously the money for \nthis new distribution will require decreases in important domestic \nspending and borrowing from the Social Security trust fund. I believe \nthis is a terrible idea when other pressing budget priorities are \nshortchanged and cut.\n  Our Nation's veterans are currently on year-long waiting lists to get \naccess to VA health care, our rural hospitals and nursing homes are on \nthe verge of closing because of inadequate Medicare/Medicaid \nreimbursement, our schools are struggling to stay open due to reduced \nbudgets, and the President says we don't have the funds for South \nDakota's water projects. Some may see the people affected by these cuts \nas ``special interests.'' I see them as South Dakotans who should not \nbe short-changed to provide tax cuts that overwhelmingly benefit the \nwealthiest one percent of Americans.\n  I remember when being a conservative meant living within one's means, \nand that is the strategy our Nation ought to return to. President \nClinton had it right when he called for an secured a balanced Federal \nbudget--that meant we were not borrowing from Social Security, we were \nnot creating huge new debts for future generations to pay off, we were \ncreating millions of new jobs, and we were not jeopardizing Medicare \nand Social Security. Government is about priorities, and the Bush \nadministration's budget priorities are wrong in too many instances. I \nwill continue to do all that I can to redirect our Nation's resources \nto an agenda that better meets America's domestic needs and our \ninternational moral obligations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, we have had a good debate. I appreciate \nour colleagues staying this late. We have been on this bill for a \nlittle over 13 hours today.

Madam President, the degree to which our Nation prospers \nin the 21st century will depend on our abilities to develop scientific \ntalent in our youth, to provide lifelong learning to a well-educated \nworkforce able to embrace the rapid pace of technological change, and \nto raise the level of public scientific and technological literacy.\n  That is why I am proud to announce a very exciting series of events \ntaking place this week in my home State of South Dakota.\n  We urgently need to upgrade American students' knowledge and skills \nacross the educational spectrum, particularly in mathematics, science, \nand technology. Results of an international science and mathematics \nstudy conducted in 2000 indicate that ``children in the United States \nwere among the leaders in the 4th grade assessment, but by high school \ngraduation they were almost last.'' Part of the problem is that many \ngirls and young women in junior and senior high school lose interest in \nscience and technological careers.\n  As we work to develop the finest scientists and engineers for the \n21st century, our human resources policy must move beyond simply the \nsupply and demand of personnel and address the composition of the \nscience and engineering workforce. Achieving diversity throughout the \nranks of the scientific and technical workforce presents a formidable \nchallenge; the number of\n\n[[Page S2538]]\n\nwomen and minorities in science and engineering, relative even to \nprofessions such as medicine and law, remains low.\n  We need to draw upon the full talent pool. Quality of education and \nequality of educational opportunity are central to our political future \nas well as to producing the workforce needed to maintain American \nleadership in the century ahead.\n  To address this challenge, the National Weather Service Forecast \nOffices in Aberdeen and Rapid City, with the support of local and State \nagencies, schools, and businesses, are co-hosting Women in Science \nconferences in Aberdeen, Watertown, Pierre, and Hot Springs the week of \nMarch 8 through 13, 2004. Governor Rounds has declared that week to be \n``Women in Science Week'' in South Dakota.\n  These conferences provide a forum for young women and girls to learn \nabout the virtually limitless opportunities available in math- and \nscience-related careers and to create personal connections with \nprofessional women scientists. These positive role models encourage \nyoung women to develop or continue to cultivate an interest in science \nand technological careers. A total of over 700 junior and senior high \nschool students and teachers will attend these conferences.\n  The work of all these individuals and organizations to inspire and \nmentor young women, and offer role models is crucial. My special thanks \nand appreciation go to everyone involved in this partnership--teachers, \nworkers, State, local, and Federal Government, academia, and \nbusinesses--who will make this a successful and an inspiring \nconference.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/10/senate-section/article/S2538-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2538]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Madam President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  In the fall of 1999 in Washington County, PA, Ira Swearingen, a 49-\nyear-old medical consultant was abducted, beaten and murdered. After \nbeing abducted, Swearingen was stuffed inside the trunk of his car \nwhile one of the perpetrators allegedly said, ``Did ya' hear it? I \nbroke his jaw.'' Another perpetrator heard gurgling of blood and heard \nthe victim screaming. They yelled ``Shut up faggot!'' Later, the victim \nwas driven to an isolated area, forced to strip and marched into the \nwoods as he pleaded for his life at which point, one perpetrator \ntestified, he shot the victim between the eyes at close range.\n  Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to defend them \nagainst the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law Enforcement \nEnhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. By passing this \nlegislation and changing current law, we can change hearts and minds as \nwell.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/10/senate-section/article/S2538-2", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2538]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               MILITARY SURVIVOR BENEFITS IMPROVEMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I rise to encourage my colleagues to \nsupport S. 1916, the Military Survivor Benefits Improvement Act. The \npurpose of this legislation is to correct a long standing inequity in \nsurvivor benefits paid to the widows and widowers of our military \nretirees and what is afforded survivors of other Federal retirees. This \nlegislation would balance cost and equity considerations by phasing in \nan increased benefit for military surviving spouses, over a 10-year \nperiod, from 35 percent to 55 percent of retired pay after age 62.\n  The military Survivor Benefits Plan simply does not stack up with the \nFederal civilian Survivor Benefit Plan either in benefits to survivors \nor in intended Government cost sharing to help reduce premium costs. \nWhen you compare survivor benefits you find that the military Survivor \nBenefit Plan provides for 55 percent of retired pay until the widow is \n62, then drops payments to 35 percent of retired pay. This dramatic \ndrop can translate to as much as one third of the previous payment.\n  Survivors of Federal civilian retirees under the earlier Civilian \nService Retirement System receive 55 percent of retired pay--with no \ndrop in benefits at age 62. Under the newer Federal Employee Retirement \nSystem, survivors receive 50 percent of retired pay, again with no drop \nat age 62. When the military Survivor Benefit Plan was enacted, the \nCongress intended a 40-percent Government subsidy for cost of military \nSurvivor Benefit Plan premiums. Over time, because of conservative \nactuarial cost assumptions, the Government's cost share has declined to \n19 percent. This means that military retirees are now paying 81 percent \nof program costs from their retired pay versus the intended 60 percent. \nThis contrasts with a Government Service Retirement System and 33 \npercent for the current Federal Employee Retirement System.\n  In closing, I submit that these inequities are unfair to the \ndeserving survivors of military retirees and should be corrected by \nsupporting this important measure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/10/senate-section/article/S2538-3", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2538-S2539]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TIBETAN UPRISING DAY\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, March 10 has been known around the \nworld as ``Tibetan Uprising Day.'' Today, as Tibetans remember those \nwho died resisting Chinese occupation, we too should reflect on the \nstruggles that have faced Tibet since that fateful day 45 years ago. \nThe events of that day, followed by over four decades of struggle by \nthe Tibetan people, is a plight that has become known to many around \nthe world.\n  After Chinese invasion in 1949 and despite the 1951 Seventeen Point \nAgreement forced upon the Tibetans by the Chinese Government, it was \nclear by 1958 that they had no intention of securing the preservation \nof Tibetan autonomy and institutions. By March 10, 1959 so many \nTibetans feared for the Dalai Lama's life that they surrounded his \ncompound as a means of protection and began protesting Chinese \noccupation. Only seven days later the Dalai Lama escaped to India \nfearing for the lives of his vigilant people. After the crowds refused \norders to leave the compound and unaware of the Dalai Lama's escape, \nthe People's Liberation Army launched an attack killing thousands of \ninnocent civilians. It is estimated that 87,000 Tibetans were killed, \narrested or deported to labor camps during the uprising. Many attempted \nescaping the communist persecution to India, but only a small \npercentage actually survived the difficult conditions.\n  The United States has long supported the Tibetan right to self-\ndetermination and has declared Tibet to be an occupied territory. In \n2000 this very body passed a resolution recognizing March 10 as Tibetan \nUprising Day. In fact, the United States has supported the Dalai Lama's \ncommitment to a dialogue and has commended him for his 1989 Nobel Peace \nPrize recognizing his efforts to work for self-determination through \nnon-violent means. In the Dalai Lama's statement today he said, and I \nquote,\n\n       My hope is that this year may see a significant \n     breakthrough in our relations with the Chinese Government. As \n     in 1954, so also today, I am determined to leave no stone \n     unturned for seeking a mutually beneficial solution that will \n     address both Chinese concerns as well as achieve for the \n     Tibetan people a life of freedom, peace and dignity.\n\n  I, like the Dalai Lama, hope that this year will be a breakthrough \nyear for the Tibetan cause. On the eve of the 60th Session of the U.N. \nCommission on Human Rights, let us not forget or neglect the plight of \nTibetans who have struggled for too long.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full statement of the Dalai Lama be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nStatement of His Holiness the Dalai Lama on the Forty-Fifth Anniversary \n                    of Tibetan National Uprising Day\n\n                             March 10, 2004\n\n       Today we commemorate the 45th anniversary of the Tibetan \n     People's Uprising of 1959. I pay tribute to the many brave \n     Tibetan men and women who have sacrificed their lives for the \n     cause of Tibetan freedom. They will always be remembered.\n       This year marks 50 years since my visit to mainland China \n     in 1954 to meet with the then Chinese leaders, especially Mao \n     Tse-tung. I remember very well that I embarked on the journey \n     with deep concerns about the future of Tibet. I was assured \n     by all the leaders I met that the Chinese presence in Tibet \n     was to work for the welfare of the Tibetans\n\n[[Page S2539]]\n\n     and ``to help develop'' Tibet. While in China I also learned \n     about internationalism and socialism which deeply impressed \n     me. So I returned to Tibet with optimism and confidence that \n     a peaceful and mutually beneficial coexistence could be \n     worked out. Unfortunately, soon after my return China was \n     embroiled in political unrest unleashed by radical political \n     campaigns. These developments impacted the Chinese policy on \n     Tibet resulting in more repression and rigidity leading \n     finally to the Tibetan People's Uprising in March 1959.\n       My hope is that this year may see a significant \n     breakthrough in our relations with the Chinese Government. As \n     in 1954, so also today, I am determined to leave no stone \n     unturned for seeking a mutually beneficial solution that will \n     address both Chinese concerns as well as achieve for the \n     Tibetan people a life in freedom, peace and dignity. Despite \n     the decades of separation the Tibetan people continue to \n     place tremendous trust and hope in me. I feel a great sense \n     of responsibility to act as their free spokesman. In this \n     regard, the fact that President Hu Jintao has personal \n     knowledge about the situation and problems in Tibet can be a \n     positive factor in resolving the Tibetan issue. I am \n     therefore willing to meet with today's leaders of the \n     People's Republic of China in the effort to secure a mutually \n     acceptable solution to the Tibetan issue.\n       My envoys have established direct contact with the Chinese \n     government on two trips to China in September 2002 and in \n     May/June 2003. This is a positive and welcome development, \n     which was initiated during the Presidency of Jiang Zemin. The \n     issue of Tibet is complex and of crucial importance to \n     Tibetan as well as Chinese peoples. Consequently, it requires \n     careful consideration and serious deliberations on both sides \n     before taking any decisions. It will take time, patience and \n     determination to lead this process to a successful \n     conclusion. However, I consider it of highest importance to \n     maintain the momentum and to intensify and deepen this \n     process through regular face-to-face meetings and substantive \n     discussions. This is the only way to dispel existing distrust \n     and misconception and to build trust and confidence.\n       Consequently, I have instructed my envoys to visit China at \n     the earliest date to continue the process. I hope that they \n     will be able to make this trip without delay. This will help \n     in building trust and confidence in the present process among \n     Tibetans as well as among our friends and supporters around \n     the world--many of whom remain strongly skeptical about the \n     willingness of Beijing to engage in a genuine process of \n     rapprochement and dialogue.\n       The current situation in Tibet benefits neither the \n     Tibetans nor the government of the People's Republic of \n     China. The development projects that the Chinese Government \n     has launched in Tibet--purportedly to benefit the Tibetan \n     people--are, however, having negative effects on the Tibetan \n     people's distinct cultural, religious and linguistic \n     identity. More Chinese settlers are coming to Tibet resulting \n     in the economic marginalization of the Tibetan people and the \n     sinicization of their culture. Tibetans need to see an \n     improvement in the quality of their life, the restoration of \n     Tibet's pristine environment and the freedom to decide an \n     appropriate model of development.\n       I welcome the release of Ani Phuntsok Nyidrol, even as we \n     recognize the injustice of her sentence and continue to urge \n     for the release of all political prisoners in Tibet. The \n     human rights situation in Tibet has not seen any marked \n     improvement. Human rights violations in Tibet have a distinct \n     character of preventing Tibetans as a people from asserting \n     their own identify and culture. The violations are a result \n     of policies of racial and cultural discrimination and \n     religious intolerance.\n       Against this background we are encouraged and grateful that \n     many individuals, governments and parliaments around the \n     world have been urging the People's Republic of China to \n     resolve the question of Tibet through peaceful negotiations. \n     Led by the European Union and the United States there is \n     growing realization in the international community that the \n     issue of Tibet is not one of human rights violations alone \n     but of a deeper political nature which needs to be resolved \n     through negotiations.\n       I am also encouraged by the recent improvements in the \n     relationship between India and China. It has always been my \n     belief that better understanding and relations between India \n     and China, the two most populous nations of the world is of \n     vital importance for peace and stability in Asia in \n     particular and in the world in general. I believe that \n     improved relations between India and China will create a more \n     conducive political environment for a peaceful resolution of \n     the Tibetan issue. I also strongly believe India can and \n     should play a constructive and influential role in resolving \n     the Tibetan problem peacefully. My ``Middle-Way-Approach'' \n     should be an acceptable policy on Tibet for India as it \n     addresses the Tibetan issue within the framework of the \n     People's Republic of China. A solution to the Tibetan issue \n     through this approach would help India to resolve many of her \n     disputes with China, too.\n       It is 54 years since the establishment of the People's \n     Republic of China. During Mao Zedong's period much emphasis \n     was put on ideology, while Deng Ziaoping concentrated \n     primarily on economic development. His successor Jiang Zemin \n     broadened the base of the Communist Party by enabling wealthy \n     people to become part of the Communist Party under his theory \n     of ``The Three Represents''. In recent times Hu Jintao and \n     his colleagues were able to achieve a smooth transition of \n     leadership. During the past decades China has been able to \n     make much progress.\n       But there have also been shortcomings and failures in \n     various fields, including in the economy. One of the main \n     causes of the shortcomings and failures seems to be the \n     inability to deal with and act according to the true and real \n     situation. In order to know the real and true situation it is \n     essential that there be free information.\n       China is undergoing a process of deep change. In order to \n     effect this change smoothly and without chaos and violence I \n     believe it is essential that there be more openness and \n     greater freedom of information and proper awareness among the \n     general public. We should seek truth from facts--facts that \n     are not falsified. Without this China cannot hope to achieve \n     genuine stability. How can there be stability if things must \n     be hidden and people are not able to speak out their true \n     feelings?\n       I am hopeful that China will become more open and \n     eventually more democratic. I have for many years advocated \n     that the change and transformation of China should take place \n     smoothly and without major upheavals. This is in the interest \n     of not only the Chinese people but also the world community.\n       China's emergence as a regional and global power is also \n     accompanied by concerns, suspicion and fears about her power. \n     Hosting the Olympic Games and World Exposition will not help \n     to dispel these concerns. Unless Beijing addresses the lack \n     of basic civil and political rights and freedoms of its \n     citizens, especially with regard to minorities, China will \n     continue to face difficulties in reassuring the world that \n     she is a peaceful, responsible, constructive and forward-\n     looking power.\n       The Tibetan issue represents both a challenge and an \n     opportunity for a maturing China to act as en emerging global \n     player with vision and values of openness, freedom, justice \n     and truth. A constructive and flexible approach to the issue \n     of Tibet will go a long way in creating a political climate \n     of trust, confidence and openness, both domestically and \n     internationally. A peaceful resolution of the Tibetan issue \n     will have wide-ranging positive impacts on China's transition \n     and transformation into a modern, open and free society. \n     There is now a window of opportunity for the Chinese \n     leadership to act with courage and farsightedness in \n     resolving the Tibetan issue once and for all.\n       I would like to take this opportunity to express my \n     appreciation and gratitude for this consistent support that \n     we have been receiving throughout the world. I would also \n     like to express once again on behalf of the Tibetans our \n     appreciation and immense gratitude to the people and the \n     Government of India for their unwavering and unmatched \n     generosity and support.\n       With my prayers for the well-being of all sentient beings.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/10/senate-section/article/S2539-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2539-S2540]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TIBETAN DAY OF COMMEMORATION\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I rise today to commemorate the 45th \nanniversary of the Tibetan Uprising of 1959. I sincerely hope that \nChinese and Tibetan leaders will take this opportunity to work together \nin a spirit of cooperation and dialogue to overcome differences that \nhave plagued relations between China and Tibet for too long.\n  After the Chinese invasion of Tibet in 1949-1950, China and the Tibet \nGovernment signed the ``Seventeen Points Agreement'' to make Tibet an \nautonomous region in the People's Republic of China and grant the \nTibetan people the right of autonomy in determining the shape of their \nreligious, cultural, and social institutions.\n  Nevertheless, in the ensuing years the Chinese Government did not \nfulfill its commitments, leading to the 1959 Lhasa Uprising and the \nflight of the Dalai Lama. Forty-five years later, tens of thousands of \nTibetan refugees have been forced to flee their homeland in the face of \nrepeated oppression and human rights abuses and those that remain are \nstill unable to practice their religion freely and preserve their \ncultural autonomy.\n  Despite this tragedy, the Dalai Lama has consistently stated that his \ngoal is not independence for Tibet but rather cultural and religious \nautonomy for the Tibetan people and negotiations within the framework \nenunciated by Deng Xiaoping in 1979.\n  Last year, in his speech to commemorate the Lhasa Rebellion, the \nDalai Lama said:\n\n       As far back as the early seventies in consultation with \n     senior Tibetan officials I made a decision to seek a solution \n     to the Tibetan problem through a ``Middle Way Approach.'' \n     This framework does not call for independence and separation \n     of Tibet. At the same time, it provides genuine autonomy for \n     the six million men and women who consider themselves \n     Tibetans, to preserve their distinctive identity, to promote \n     their religious\n\n[[Page S2540]]\n\n     and cultural heritage that is based on a centuries-old \n     philosophy which is a benefit even in the 21st century, and \n     to protect the delicate environment of the Tibetan plateau. \n     This approach will contribute to the overall stability and \n     unity of the People's Republic of China.\n\n  I have worked on behalf of Tibet and the Tibetan people for over 20 \nyears and I have done everything in my power to bring China and Tibet \ntogether to settle their differences peacefully at the negotiating \ntable. I have personally carried messages from the Dalai Lama to China \non these issues and there is no doubt in my mind that he is fully \nprepared to negotiate with China to achieve a just and lasting peace \nfor the Tibetan people.\n  It is disappointing that another year has gone by and more progress \nhas not been achieved in settling these issues. The road ahead of us is \nlong but we must persevere to ensure that the Tibetan people will one \nday achieve the freedom and autonomy to shape their own society. It is \nmy sincere hope that China will cooperate with the Dalai Lama in \nresolving their differences on Tibet.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/10/senate-section/article/S2540-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2540]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            FULL FAITH AND CREDIT CLAUSE OF THE CONSTITUTION\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I welcome this opportunity to call the \nattention of the Senate to an impressive article in yesterday's Wall \nStreet Journal by Professor Lea Brilmayer of Yale Law School on the \nproposed amendment to the Constitution on same-sex marriage.\n  Supporters of the amendment claim that same-sex marriages in one \nState must be recognized in all other States. That claim is not true. \nAs Professor Brilmayer explains, ``Longstanding precedent from around \nthe country holds that a state need not recognize a marriage entered \ninto in another state with different marriage laws if those laws are \ncontrary to strongly held public policy.'' States have broad discretion \nin deciding to what extent they will defer to other states when dealing \nwith sensitive questions about marriage and raising families.\n  There is no need to amend the Constitution on this issue. States \nacross the country are clearly dealing with the issue and doing so \neffectively, according to the wishes of the citizens in each of the 50 \nStates. If it is not necessary to amend the Constitution, it is \nnecessary not to amend it.\n  Professor Brilmayer testified on these constitutional issues at our \nJudiciary Subcommittee hearing last week, and I ask unanimous consent \nthat her article in the Wall Street Journal be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, Mar. 9, 2004]\n\n                         Full Faith and Credit\n\n                           (By Lea Brilmayer)\n\n       Last Wednesday's hearing before the Senate's ``Subcommittee \n     on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Property Rights'' was \n     billed as the occasion for a serious discussion on the need \n     for a constitutional amendment to limit the interstate \n     effects of Goodridge, the Massachusetts court decision \n     recognizing a state constitutional right to same-sex \n     marriage. Why else would the hearing's organizers invite me, \n     a professor with no particular published opinion on gay \n     rights but dozens of technical publications on interstate \n     jurisdiction? Prepared to do battle over the correct \n     interpretation of the Constitution's Full Faith and Credit \n     Clause, I found myself instead in the middle of a debate \n     about whether marriage is a good thing, and who really loves \n     America's kids the most--Republicans or Democrats.\n       Like many political debates, the discussion was framed in \n     absolutist terms. Conservatives say that without a \n     constitutional amendment, Goodridge goes national. Gays will \n     travel to Massachusetts to get married and then their home \n     states will be forced (under the Full Faith and Credit \n     Clause) to recognize their marriages. Traditional marriage \n     (apparently a frailer institution than I'd realized) will be \n     fatally undermined unless we act now to prevent the \n     Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court from imposing its will \n     upon the whole nation. Either amend the Constitution to adopt \n     a national, and traditional, definition of marriage (they \n     say) or there will soon be gay and lesbian married couples \n     living in your own neighborhood. Either it's their nationwide \n     standard--anyone can marry--or it's ours.\n       The fly in the ointment was that nobody bothered to check \n     whether the Full Faith and Credit Clause had actually ever \n     been read to require one state to recognize another state's \n     marriages. It hasn't. Longstanding precedent from around the \n     country holds that a state need not recognize a marriage \n     entered into in another state with different marriage laws if \n     those laws are contrary to strongly held local public policy. \n     The ``public policy doctrine,'' almost as old as this \n     country's legal system, has been applied to foreign marriages \n     between first cousins, persons too recently divorced, persons \n     of different races, and persons under the age of consent. The \n     granting of a marriage license has always been treated \n     differently than a court award, which is indeed entitled to \n     full interstate recognition. Court judgments are entitled to \n     full faith and credit but historically very little interstate \n     recognition has been given to licenses.\n       From a technical legal point of view, the debate at last \n     week's hearing was entirely unnecessary. But inciting a \n     divisive and diversionary debate over whether America's \n     children will only thrive in traditional marriages (on the \n     one hand) or whether people who oppose gay marriage are \n     bigots (on the other) was probably a central objective in \n     certain quarters. Social conservatives, in particular, have a \n     vested interest in overstating the ``domino effect'' of \n     Goodridge. This is particularly true in an election year. \n     Only an ivory tower academic carrying a text full of \n     footnotes would notice anything odd.\n       The assumption that there must be a single national \n     definition of marriage--traditional or open-ended--is \n     mistaken and pernicious. It is mistaken because the existing \n     constitutional framework has long accommodated differing \n     marriage laws. This is an area where the slogan ``stages \n     rights'' not only works relatively well, but also has \n     traditionally been left to do its job. We are familiar with \n     the problems of integrating different marriage laws because \n     for the last 200 years the issue has been left, fairly \n     successfully, to the states. The assumption is pernicious \n     because the winner-takes-all attitude that it engenders now \n     has social conservatives pushing us down the constitutional-\n     amendment path. For those who see the matter in terms of gay \n     rights, this would be a tragedy. But it would also be a \n     tragedy for those who genuinely favor local autonomy, or even \n     those of us who genuinely favor keeping the constitutional \n     text uncluttered by unnecessary amendments.\n       If today's proponents of a marriage amendment are motivated \n     by the fear of some full faith and credit chain-reaction set \n     off in other states by Massachusetts, they needn't be. If \n     they are motivated by the desire to assert political control \n     over what happens inside Massachusetts, they shouldn't be. In \n     our 200-year constitutional history, there has never yet been \n     a federal constitutional amendment designed specifically to \n     reverse a state's interpretation of its own laws. Goodridge, \n     whether decided rightly or wrongly, was decided according to \n     Massachusetts' highest court's view of Massachusetts law. \n     People in other states have no legitimate interest in forcing \n     Massachusetts to reverse itself--Massachusetts will do that \n     itself, if and when it wants to--and those who want to try \n     should certainly not cite the Full Faith and Credit clause in \n     rationalizing their attempts.\n       Unlike most other hotly contested social issues, the \n     current constitutional marriage debate actually has a \n     perfectly good technical solution. We should just keep doing \n     what we've been doing for the last 200 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/10/senate-section/article/S2540-2", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2540-S2541]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           SBA EMERGENCY AUTHORIZATION EXTENSION ACT OF 2004\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, yesterday I introduced a bill, S. 2186, \nto keep the SBA, its two largest lending programs, the 504 and 7(a) \nLoan Guarantee Programs, and the Women's Business Centers up and \nrunning through the remainder of this year, September 30, 2004. I ask \nunanimous consent that a letter of support from the trade association \nof 7(a) lenders, the National Association of Government Guaranteed \nLenders, be printed in the Record. Along with NAGGL, I thank the \nAmerican Bankers Association, the Independent Community Bankers of \nAmerica, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the many other small business \nassociations, that have helped us find solutions, demonstrating great \ncooperation in a difficult position, to help small businesses.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                Government Guaranteed Lenders,\n\n                                   Stillwater, OK, March 10, 2004.\n     Re SBA 7(a) Funding Crisis and S. 2186.\n\n     Hon. John F. Kerry,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kerry: As Congress considers how to solve the \n     ongoing SBA 7(a) program funding crisis, we are writing to \n     express our support for S. 2186, which includes provisions \n     that both Small Business Committees and the 7(a) industry \n     have already agreed are equitable.\n       While NAGGL is generally opposed to programmatic fee \n     increases, the 2004 budget for the 7(a) program has made his \n     concession necessary. NAGGL testified in 2003 that 2004 \n     program demand would be nearly $12 billion, but the \n     Administration adamantly disagreed with our estimate, \n     providing program level\n\n[[Page S2541]]\n\n     of only $9.5 billion. The Administration has also failed to \n     reprogram any additional money to the 7(a) program or offer a \n     supplemental appropriations request.\n       As a result, the SBA's flagship 7(a) loan program, the \n     single largest provider of long-term start-up and expansion \n     loans to American's small businesses, has been crippled since \n     the beginning of this fiscal year, when the SBA temporarily \n     shut it down due to a funding shortfall. When the Agency \n     reopened the program a week later, it implemented an \n     artificial loan cap of $750,000--a reduction of more than 50% \n     of the program's statutory loan limit of $2 million--and a \n     prohibition on piggyback loans, which would have allowed \n     lenders to make loans in excess of a loan cap.\n       Businesses who had already submitted applications for loans \n     in excess of the new cap were then told their deals would not \n     qualify for the program. These applicants had gone through \n     months of financial planning and had been promised their \n     loans would be approved. Many had already begun purchasing \n     equipment and hiring employees. And if their deals don't get \n     done, many will lose earnest money they had taken from \n     personal savings and retirement plans to inject into these \n     loans.\n       Other potential applicants who would ordinarily qualify for \n     the 7(a) program have since been told there is no alternative \n     to finance their start-up or expansion. The net result \n     to these small businesses is a loss of faith in the U.S. \n     government. The net result to the economy is a loss of \n     jobs.\n       The provisions of S. 2186 fix this problem, and the bill \n     has NAGGL's full support. As the trade association \n     representing lenders who make over 80% of loans in the 7(a) \n     program every year, we can attest to the fact that the \n     minimal fee increases in S. 2186 are ones that lenders will \n     pay and will not be passed along to borrowers. We also \n     continue to oppose the SBA's legislative proposal to reduce \n     the guarantee on all 7(a) loans to 50% and allow the \n     legislation that provided for lender and borrower fee \n     decreases through the end of this fiscal year to simply \n     sunset.\n       Without the provisions of S. 2186, $3 billion in loans will \n     remain unavailable to small businesses for the remainder of \n     FY 2004--a net loss of approximately 90,000 jobs. We also \n     fear that if a swift and equitable solution is not enacted, \n     many 7(a) lenders will flee the program, leaving a void in \n     availability of the long-term financing that is so crucial to \n     small businesses' success. This will be occurring at a time \n     when our economy is in desperate need of a shot in the arm.\n       We request that you press for swift passage of S. 2186 to \n     bolster economic recovery and the small businesses that can \n     drive it. Thank you in advance for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Tony Wilkinson,\n     President & CEO, NAGGL.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/10/senate-section/article/S2541-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2541]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    NOMINATION OF STEPHEN JOHNSON TO BE DEPUTY ADMINISTRATOR OF THE \n                    ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, today, I announced my intention to object \nto any unanimous consent request for the Senate to take up the \nnomination of Stephen Johnson to be Deputy Administrator of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency. I did this because I have been trying \nto obtain information concerning EPA's decision to become involved with \nthe City of Portland's combined sewer overflow program since last \nAugust. Despite numerous requests, EPA has to this point failed to \nanswer my questions and failed to provide me with the documents I have \nrequested, with the exception of a limited number of documents that EPA \nwould have to provide to any requester under FOIA.\n  There are legitimate questions about EPA's decision to intervene 10 \nyears after the City signed an enforceable order with the State of \nOregon and after the city and its ratepayers have spent more than $500 \nmillion to reduce sewer overflows. But to date, I have been unable to \nget answers to my questions from EPA despite repeated requests.\n  Last August, I wrote to the Acting EPA Administrator Marianne Horinko \nrequesting answers to a number of questions concerning EPA's decision \nto become involved with the City of Portland's combined sewer overflow \nprogram. I also requested copies of documents about the Portland sewer \nsituation. I never received answers to my specific questions, and I \nhave received only a small number of the documents I requested.\n  I also submitted written questions following a hearing of the Senate \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee on September 15 to then EPA \nAssistant Administrator for Water, Tracy Mehan. I never received a \nresponse from Mr. Mehan, who has subsequently left the agency, or \nanyone else from EPA.\n  In October, I received a letter from Acting EPA Administrator \nMarianne Horinko promising to ``work[] with your staff to identify \nwhich of the documents that are not enforcement sensitive or \nconfidential would be most helpful to you.'' Since then, I have \nreceived only a slim file of documents that doesn't begin to answer my \nquestions.\n  Finally, I ask EPA Administrator Leavitt to look into this personally \nmore than a month ago.\n  Until I receive answers to my questions and the documents I need to \nexercise my oversight responsibilities over EPA as a member of the \nSenate Environment and Public Works Committee, I will continue to \nobject to any unanimous consent request for the Senate to take up the \nnomination of Stephen Johnson to be Deputy Administrator of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/10/senate-section/article/S2541-2", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2541-S2542]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    RECOGNITION OF E. NORMAN VEASEY\n\n Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I rise today in recognition of \nthe Honorable E. Norman Veasey upon his retirement as Chief Justice of \nthe Supreme Court of Delaware. He has served as Chief Justice of the \nState of Delaware for 12 years. His leadership over that span of time \nhas won him the respect and gratitude of our entire State. He has been, \nand remains, a trusted friend.\n  Chief Justice Veasey was born on January 9, 1933 in Wilmington, DE to \nthe late Dr. Eugene E. Veasey and Elizabeth N. Burnett. He attended the \nPeddie School in Hightstown, NJ. From there, he went on to Dartmouth \nCollege where he obtained his A.B. in 1954. He then attended the \nUniversity of Pennsylvania Law School where he graduated in 1957 with \nhis LL.B. At the University of Pennsylvania Law School, he was a Member \nof the Board of Editors of the University of Pennsylvania Law Review \nfrom 1955 to 1957 and was Senior Editor from 1956 to 1957. He was \nadmitted to the Delaware Bar in 1958.\n  Chief Justice Veasey has spent most of his life in public service. He \nserved honorably in the Delaware Air National Guard from 1957 to 1968 \nwhereby he obtained the rank of captain. He has also served, among a \nlong list, as Chief Deputy Attorney General of the State of Delaware, \nChair of the Delaware Board of Bar Examiners, President of the \nConference of Chief Justices in 2000, Chair of the ABA Special \nCommittee on the Evaluation of the Rules of Professional Conduct \n``Ethics 2000'', and President of the Delaware State Bar Association. \nFurthermore, he served as a Director of Beneficial Corporation and \nNational Bank for 13 years from 1979 to 1992.\n  From 1957 to 1988, he was a member of the prestigious Delaware law \nfirm of Richards, Layton & Finger, with practice emphasis in corporate \ntransactions, litigation and counseling. He was a member of the firm \nfrom 1957 to 1992, serving as a partner from 1963 to 1992 and as \npresident from 1985 to 1988.\n  Judge Veasey became Chief Justice of the State of Delaware on April \n7, 1992, having been nominated to that post by then Governor Michael N. \nCastle and unanimously confirmed by the Delaware State Senate. Chief \nJustice Veasey is a Judicial Fellow of the American College of Trial \nLawyers and is a member of both the Standing Committee on Rules of \nPractice and Procedure of the United States Judicial Conference and the \nAmerican Law Institute. He is a Life Fellow of the American Bar \nFoundation and a director of the Institute for Law and Economics at the \nUniversity of Pennsylvania. He has been a frequent speaker on corporate \ngovernance, ethics and professionalism at continuing legal education \nprograms and has been published widely in the fields related to \ncorporate governance.\n  In June of 2002, Chief Justice Veasey received the 2002 Paul C. \nReardon Award, one of the highest awards given by the National Center \nfor State Courts, NCSC. The Reardon Award, named after the late \nMassachusetts Supreme Court Justice who was the first president of The \nNational Center's Board of Directors, is presented to a person who has \nmade outstanding contributions to the improvement of the justice system \nand who has supported the mission of The National Center.\n  Chief Justice Veasey has been a member of the Conference of Chief \nJustices since 1992, and headed the conference from 1999 to 2000, a \nsingular\n\n[[Page S2542]]\n\nhonor for him and for Delaware. He has been intimately involved in \nissues of attorney ethics, having served as chair of the American Bar \nAssociation's Special Committee on Evaluation of Rules of Professional \nConduct, Ethics 2000. A frequent speaker on corporate governance, \nethics, and professionalism at continuing legal education programs, \nChief Justice Veasey has been published widely in the fields related to \ncorporate governance. From 1994 to 1995, he was Chair of the Section of \nBusiness Law of the ABA. Justice Veasey is also a Judicial Fellow of \nthe American College of Trial Lawyers.\n  Justice Veasey has been married to the former Suzanne Johnson for 47 \nyears. Both he and Suzy are the proud parents of four children, Andrew, \nDouglas, E. Norman, Jr. and Marian Elizabeth, and even prouder \ngrandparents to eleven grandchildren.\n  Through Chief Justice Veasey's tireless efforts, he has made a \nprofound difference in the lives of thousands of Delawareans. Upon his \nretirement, he will leave behind a legacy of commitment to public \nservice for both his children and grandchildren and for the generations \nthat will follow. I thank him for the friendship that we share and for \nthe privilege of working closely with him when I served as Governor of \nDelaware from 1993 to 2001. On behalf of all Delawareans, I \ncongratulate him on a truly remarkable and distinguished career. I wish \nhim, Suzy and their family only the very best in all that lies ahead \nfor each of them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/10/senate-section/article/S2542-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2542]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       HONORING RETIRING SENATORS IN THE IDAHO STATE LEGISLATURE\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, I rise today to honor some good \nfriends who will retire later this month from the Idaho State Senate \nafter a long history of public service.\n  Laird Noh is completing his twelfth term, representing District 24, \nTwin Falls County. Presently he serves as the chairman of the Senate \nCommittee on Resources and Environment; he is also a member of the \nSenate Committee on Agriculture Affairs and the Senate Committee on \nEducation. Throughout his career, Senator Noh has provided reasoned \nstability, civility and wisdom to a wide range of issues confronting \nthe State of Idaho for all these years.\n  Since he began his tireless service to Idaho in 1980, he has set a \nhigh standard for public service. Since I was elected to the Idaho \nState Senate in 1984, Laird has been a friend and mentor to me. I have \nalways appreciated his thoughtful insights and measured manner. In \ncountless meetings with Laird, he has paid incredible attention to the \ninformation given and followed that up with salient questions and real \naction. He has had remarkable foresight on a number of legislative \nissues, and been able to ascertain how an issue or piece of legislation \nwill affect Idahoans down the road. He is truly a statesman who \nfollowed his own moral compass and set a course that he felt would best \nbenefit Idahoans. He has been dedicated to giving his all as he has \ncarefully listened to the needs of Idahoans. His leadership and \ninstitutional knowledge will be greatly missed as he retires after 24 \nyears of service.\n  I am certain that his wife Kathleen and his children, John and Susan, \nwill be pleased to have him back home, but I fully expect that he will \nstay involved in his community. Idaho is a better place to live because \nof Laird Noh's fine service to the State and its people. I know they \njoin with me in thanking him and wishing him well in his future \nendeavors.\n  Sheila Sorensen is completing her sixth term representing District 18 \nin Ada County. She has been a significant force in the Idaho State \nSenate, and is completing her tenure as the chairman of the State \nAffairs Committee. She has also served this session on Judiciary and \nRules.\n  Public servants like Sheila are hard to come by. She has demonstrated \na strong commitment to her community and her ideals as she has \nrepresented District 18. Sheila is known for her political courage. She \nhas been willing to work across party lines and develop solutions that \nwill make Idaho a better place to live and work. Her medical training \nhas given her unique insight into many issues that have come before the \nIdaho State Senate.\n  Her contributions to Idaho will be felt long after she retires from \nthe State senate. Sheila and her husband Dean are longtime friends and \nsupporters of mine, and I will personally miss having them in Idaho and \nlook forward to their return to our State. I appreciate her service, \nand know that many others in District 18 and across the State join with \nme in wishing her the best as she moves to the next challenges in her \nlife.\n  Cecil Ingram is also completing his sixth term representing District \n16 in Ada County. He is finishing up his service in the State senate as \nchairman of the Transportation Committee. His service on the Health and \nWelfare Committee and the Local Government and Taxation Committee has \nalso been admirable.\n  He has provided leadership to our State in so many areas, and has \nbeen an example of a great public servant. Cecil is known for his \nindependent streak that has advanced the debate on many public policy \nissues in Idaho, and we are better for that contribution. His efforts \nhave extended beyond the Idaho State Senate to various community \norganizations, including the Western Idaho Fair, the Salvation Army, \nthe United Way, Junior Achievement, and the Mountain States Tumor \nInstitute. Cecil's wife, Lois Ann, and his three children, Cynthia, \nWilliam, and Christopher, have provided him with strong support from \nhome, and I know that without that kind of backing, it would be \nimpossible for him to work as tirelessly as he has for the betterment \nof our State. His contributions will be greatly missed, and I send my \nbest wishes as he moves into the next phase of his life.\n  All three of these senators have carved their own mark on our State. \nThey have done it in an admirable and memorable fashion, and I know \nthat their efforts have not gone unnoticed and will likely be felt for \nyears to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/10/senate-section/article/S2542-2", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2542]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       THE 175TH ANNIVERSARY OF FAYETTEVILLE FIRST BAPTIST CHURCH\n\n Mr. MILLER.

Our places of worship are vital to the social \nfabric of our Nation, and Fayetteville First Baptist is no exception. \nIt has taken on this responsibility and remained steadfast in its \nmission for the last 175 years. I am proud of this wonderful church and \nask that my colleagues join me in wishing its congregation a happy \n175th anniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/10/senate-section/article/S2542-3", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2542-S2543]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO ELAINE RAUBACH\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I would like to take a few \nminutes to comment on the recent retirement of Elaine Raubach. Elaine \nserved for many years as the director of the Budget and Analysis Group \nof the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. In that role, Elaine \nwas responsible for putting together the budget and performance plan \nfor CMS, as well as running the agency's financial management system.\n  Elaine previously played a lead role in the development and \nimplementation of a major reorganization of the agency, then known as \nthe Health Care Financing Administration. She also served the agency in \ninformation resources management.\n  Elaine began her Federal career in 1973 with the Social Security \nAdministration and, soon thereafter, began\n\n[[Page S2543]]\n\nworking with the Medicare program. She remained with Medicare when the \nHealth Care Financing Administration was formed in 1977, and continued \nwith work in Medicare, Medicaid and other Federal health programs.\n  Elaine graduated from Rutgers University and received her Master of \nArts Degree from the University of Virginia and an Executive Master of \nBusiness Administration from Loyola College.\n  For the past several years, she provided invaluable service as \nliaison to the Appropriations Committee in the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives. She has met each and every challenge given her with \nthe utmost ability and professionalism. Elaine has been an asset in \nevery position in which she has served.\n  On behalf of the members of the Appropriations Committee, I would \nlike to take this opportunity to thank Elaine for her dedicated \nservice, of her vision which so often guided us in formulating creative \nsolutions to funding issues, and in caring for the people we serve. \nBest wishes for an enjoyable and well-deserved retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/10/senate-section/article/S2543-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2543]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:43 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 3536.

A bill to temporarily extend the programs under the Small \nBusiness Act and the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, through May \n15, 2004, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Small Business \nand Entrepreneurship.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation that \nkeeps the Small Business Administration and its financing and \ncounseling assistance available to small businesses. Small businesses \nneed us to act now to keep critical assistance available to our \nNation's biggest job creators.\n  There should not be any objections to this bill. It has broad support \nin the small business and the lending communities. The lending \nprovisions of the bill have the support of small borrowers that \ntestified before Congress over the past few weeks and the support of a \ncoalition of small business trade associations, including the trade \nassociations of 504 lenders and of 7(a) lenders, the American Bankers \nAssociation and the Independent Community Bankers Association, as well \nas the National Small Business Alliance and the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce, and the women's business center provisions have the support \nof women's trade associations such as Women Impacting Public Policy and \nthe Association of Women's Business Centers.\n  This bill authorizes the SBA and most of its programs through the May \n15, 2004, which will allow time for the House to complete its work on \nthe SBA's 3-year reauthorization bill, passed by the Senate in \nSeptember 2003. In addition, this bill addresses several urgent issues \nthat are critical to keep SBA programs operating and helping small \nbusinesses across the country.\n  Let me outline these for you. The first provision authorizes the \ncontinued operation of the SBA's 504 loan guarantee program for the \nrest of fiscal year 2004. Unless we act, the authority to operate this \nprogram will expire on March 15, next Monday, and small businesses in \nneed of financing for fixed assets will be turned away. These loans are \nfor growing small businesses that need loans with long repayment terms \nand fixed interest rates to afford a new building or perhaps land to \nexpand their business and their workforce, or equipment to improve or \nincrease production. The lenders who make these loans serve a unique \nrole in our economy--they develop economic opportunities where \nconventional lenders are not willing to take a risk. They are not a shy \ngroup, and care deeply about the communities where they live. I am sure \nmost, if not all, Senators have received numerous calls and \ncommunications from them over the past few weeks. It is my hope that \nextending authorization will provide some stability to the industry so \nthat they continue to fund our growing businesses, and then in the near \nfuture, the House will consider our more comprehensive SBA \nreauthorization legislation, bill number S. 1375, that we passed in \nSeptember, to enact other important 504 program improvements that are \nsupported by the small business community. This loan program requires \nno appropriations because it is funded entirely by fees that borrowers \nand lenders pay.\n  The second provision keeps open the doors of our most experienced and \nsuccessful Women's Business Centers, again without added cost to the \nTreasury. This bill contains a small adjustment to the Women's Business \nCenter program that updates the current funding formula. The adjustment \nchanges the portion of funding allowed for women's business centers in \nthe sustainability part of the program to keep up with the increasing \nnumber of centers that will need funding this fiscal\n\n[[Page S2546]]\n\nyear. In short, this change directs the SBA to reserve 48 percent of \nthe appropriated funds for the sustainability centers, instead of 30 \npercent, which will give the most experienced centers the greatest \nopportunity to receive sustainability funding, while still allowing for \nnew centers and protecting existing ones.\n  Currently there are 88 women's business centers. Of these, 35 are in \nthe initial grant program and 53 will have graduated to the \nsustainability part of the program. These sustainability centers make \nup more than half of the total women's business centers, but under the \ncurrent funding formula are only allotted 30 percent of the funds. \nWithout the change to 48 percent, all grants to sustainability centers \ncould be cut in half--or worse, 23 experienced centers could lose \nfunding completely. Cutting funding for these, our most efficient and \nsuccessful centers, would not only be detrimental to the centers \nthemselves, but also to the women they serve, to their local \ncommunities, to their states, and to the national economy.\n  As the author of the Women's Business Centers Sustainability Act of \n1999, I can tell you that when the bill was signed into law, it was \nCongress's intent to protect the established and successful \ninfrastructure of worth, performing centers. The law was designed to \nallow all graduating Women's Business Centers that meet certain \nperformance standards to receive continued funding under sustainability \ngrants. This approach allows for new centers to be established--but not \nby penalizing those that have already demonstrated their worth. It was \nour intention to continue helping the most productive and well-equipped \nwomen's business centers, knowing that demand for such services was \nrapidly growing.\n  Today, with women-owned businesses opening at one-and-a-half times \nthe rate of all privately held firms, the demand and need for women's \nbusiness centers is even greater. Until Congress makes permanent the \nWomen's Business Center Sustainability Pilot program, as intended in \nSenate-passed legislation, an extension of authority and increase in \nsustainability funds is vital--not only to the centers themselves, but \nto the women's business community and to the millions of workers \nemployed by women-owned businesses around the country.\n  The importance of the women's business centers to small business \nowners in communities across this country cannot be overstated. Take \nfor instance the story of Melanie Marsden and Shannon Lawler, who \nrecently opened A Better Place to Be Day Spa in Charlestown, MA. While \nworking on a business plan last summer, the two hopeful entrepreneurs \nhappened across the website of the Center for Women and Enterprise \n(CWE), a women's business center in Boston. Having just signed a lease \nand with a target opening for their spa quickly approaching, Melanie \nand Shannon were looking for help, and quick. At first, the process \nseemed overwhelming, but the experts at CWE were able to guide Melanie \nand Shannon through the complicated process--from business plan to \nlong-term financing and management. CWE helped Melanie and Shannon open \nA Better Place to Be Day Spa and already see a steady stream of clients \npass through their doors. Without CWE, Melanie and Shannon believe that \nthey would not have opened their business on time, or at all. Last year \nalone, women's business centers like CWE helped over 100,000 \nentrepreneurs just like Melanie and Shannon with their small business \nneeds. The majority of these women have few resources and little access \nto business development assistance, and without the women's business \ncenters, they might have none.\n  As I have said on more than one occasion, women business owners do \nnot get the recognition they deserve for the contribution to our \neconomy: Eighteen million Americans would be without jobs today if it \nweren't for these entrepreneurs who had the courage and the vision to \nstrike out on their own. For 19 years, as a member of the Senate \nCommittee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I have worked to \nincrease the opportunities for these enterprising women, leading to \ngreater earning power, financial independence and asset accumulation. \nFor these women, in addition to the challenge and experience of running \ntheir own business, it means having a bank account, buying a home, \nsending their children to college, and being in control of their own \nfuture.\n\n  I want to again express my sincere and continuing support for the \ngrowing community of women entrepreneurs across the Nation and for the \ninvaluable programs through which the SBA provides women business \nowners with the tools they need to succeed. For years, I have fought \nfor increased funding for SBA assistance that helps women \nentrepreneurs, including measures that have sustained and expanded the \nWomen's Business Centers, and give women entrepreneurs their deserved \nrepresentation within the Federal procurement process.\n  The third provision makes temporary changes to the SBA's largest loan \nprogram, the so-called 7(a) program, in order to compensate for the \nadministration's budget gimmicks and program mismanagement that caused \na substantial shortage in funding. This shortage led to a temporary \nshutdown of the program in January, followed by lending restrictions \nthat created serious financial hardships for small businesses and \nreduced access to affordable capital for small businesses in general. \nFor the remainder of fiscal year 2004, a coalition of 7(a) lenders and \nsmall business groups have worked with Congress to come up with some \nlimited fees, paid by lenders and not borrowers, that will increase the \namount of lending available. That extra funding will increase from $9.5 \nbillion to more than $11 billion the amount of loan guarantees \navailable to small businesses. With more funding, Congress expects the \nSBA to lift the loan cap size of $750,000 and other restrictions, give \npriority in processing and approval to eligible small businesses that \nhave been shut out this year, and require the SBA to renew export \nworking capital loans to eligible small businesses.\n  Of course, these changes would not be necessary if the administration \nhad either requested adequate funding in its budget or used its \nauthority to reprogram money to compensate for the shortfall. It also \ncould have sent up a request for supplemental funding. On three \ndifferent occasions, I wrote to the administration urging these \nactions, with the support of Senators Levin, Harkin, Lieberman, \nLandrieu, Edwards, Cantwell, Bayh, and Pryor, urging any of these \nsolutions, but the administration refused to act. Instead, the \ninsufficient funding was compounded by mismanagement and the program \nwas completely shutdown from January 6 to January 14. When the \nadministration reopened the program, it was with extreme restrictions. \nThe restrictions were aimed at keeping the demand for the loans down \nwithout regard to their effect on the small businesses the Agency is \nintended to serve. Small businesses appealed to the administration and \nour committees for help because they were caught in the middle. For \nexample, one company in Pennsylvania has a $1 million export working \ncapital loan that needs to be renewed, but it can't because one of \nSBA's restrictions does not allow loans of more than $750,000. At risk \nis the home of one of the owners because it is part of the collateral \nsecuring the existing loan. This company is qualified; it's just \ntrapped by the SBA's restrictions. With your help in passing this bill \nimmediately, we can do the right thing for these small business owners \nand others who played by the rules. There is no cost to the Treasury in \nenacting these provisions.\n  Last, the fourth provision, addresses an urgent need for some firms \nin New York needing disaster loan assistance. Many have said we should \nwait until we address other SBA legislation in the next 60 days. \nHowever, hundreds of jobs are at stake and these businesses do not have \n2 months. This language is included at the bipartisan request of the \nHouse Small Business Committee leadership. Their staffs worked closely \nwith the SBA to develop this language, which is acceptable to all of \nthem. In addition to the support of House Committee Chairman Don \nManzullo and Ranking Member Nydia Velazquez, this provision is also \nsupported by Congresswoman Sue Kelly and Senator Charles Schumer.\n  All four provisions address circumstances that require immediate \naction. Let me remind everyone: Without\n\n[[Page S2547]]\n\nthis legislation, the SBA's loan program for growing businesses, \ncommonly referred to as the 504 Loan Guarantee Program, would shut down \nnext Monday, March 15, 2004. Without this legislation, the future of \ncounseling and training for women starting and growing their \nbusinesses, through the most established SBA's Women's Business \nCenters, would be compromised. Without this legislation, small \nbusinesses with their homes and life savings at stake may face \nfinancial and personal devastation because of program mismanagement. \nWithout this legislation, small business disaster victims may go out of \nbusiness.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \ntwo letters relating to programs affected by this legislation be \nprinted in the Record. I thank my colleagues for their support of small \nbusinesses and for considering immediate passage of this important \nsmall business bill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 A Better Place to Be Day Spa,\n\n                                                  Charlestown, MA.\n       Dear Senator Kerry: This past summer I had the opportunity \n     to work with the Center for Women & Enterprise when I was in \n     the beginning stages of writing a business plan for a small \n     day spa that had long been a dream. My business partner and \n     childhood friend and I were both born to working class \n     families and raised in Charlestown. I was educated in the \n     Boston Public School system and went on to attend Boston \n     University on one of their Boston Scholars full tuition \n     scholarships. While working full time after graduation, I \n     decided to enroll at the Muscular Therapy Institute in \n     Cambridge with the goal in mind of opening my own business \n     someday. My business partner held down a full time job and \n     attended The Elizabeth Grady School of Aesthetics in \n     preparation for our venture. While for many years we talked \n     about our dream, we know that making that dream become the \n     reality it is today, would not have been possible without \n     programs like the Center for Women & Enterprise and the Small \n     Business Administration.\n       For the last 2 years we had been keeping our eyes and ears \n     open about commercial space in Charlestown, which is not easy \n     to come by and generally not affordable. Our goal was to open \n     by May 2004 (when I will turn 30 and my partner will be 31). \n     We hadn't even begun the business plan writing when the ideal \n     location became available in August. The 1,500 square foot \n     commercial space is located at Mishuwam Park Apartments on \n     Maine Street in Charlestown which is an apartment complex \n     funded through the HUD Section 236 program and is managed by \n     Peabody Properties. We had to move quickly on the space and \n     before we knew it we had signed a lease and incorporated in a \n     matter of days. Our target opening date then became November \n     1st which didn't leave us much time to pull things together \n     but we didn't even know how overwhelming the whole process \n     might have been if we had not found the Center for Women & \n     Enterprise.\n       After contacting CWE, I received a call back within minutes \n     from Bea Chiem and she would prove to be an invaluable \n     resource to us during the following months. She took what was \n     very complicated and overwhelming for us and made it so much \n     easier to understand. Every time we would come to a part of \n     the financials that we thought we might never figure out, we \n     knew Bea was only a phone call away. I was most impressed by \n     her response time to each and every question I had. Her \n     patience, knowledge and belief in our vision played a major \n     role in us getting the financing we needed. CWE should be \n     proud to have such a caring and knowledgeable woman on the \n     team.\n       The closing on our loan with Sovereign finally took place \n     last week and we got a $60,000 term loan and the $40,000 line \n     of credit we requested from Sovereign through an SBA loan. \n     Shannon and I cannot thank the Center for Women & Enterprise \n     enough for all of their help. We have no doubt that without \n     CWE (and Bea) in our corner the financial institutions we \n     approached would not have taken us as seriously.\n       The way in which the center for Women & Enterprise reaches \n     out to help women in business inspired us to do the same. In \n     selecting suppliers and inventory for our gift shop within \n     the spa, we chose to carry products that were made by women \n     or by women owned businesses with a preference given to \n     Massachusetts or New England based businesses.\n       A Better Place to Be Day Spa, was received well by the \n     Charlestown community, we had 400 people at our grand opening \n     open house on November 1st and have a steady stream of \n     clients coming through our doors each day. And in the short \n     time we have been open we have seen many repeat clients \n     already. Our business got off to a great start because of the \n     Center for Women & Enterprise and as we continue to grow I \n     will be sure to let our clients know that A Better Place to \n     Be Day Spa is here because of the guidance we received from \n     the Center for Women & Enterprise and the support of the \n     Small Business Administration.\n       In closing I need you to know that what the Center for \n     Women & Enterprise and the SBA do for women in business is \n     truly incredible. I particularly enjoy the frequent \n     newsletters outlining upcoming events as well as educational \n     opportunities and workshops that I will be sure to take \n     advantage of in the future. A Better Place to Be Day Spa will \n     be represented at the upcoming State House Day and we will \n     continue to look for ways that we can give back to other \n     women in business through CWE.\n       Thank you.\n     Melanie Marsden,\n     Shannon Lawler,\n       Owners.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                        Women Business Owners,\n\n                                   Kansas City, MO, March 9, 2004.\n     Hon. John Kerry,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Small Business and \n         Entrepreneurship.\n       Dear Senator Kerry: On behalf of the Kansas City chapter of \n     the National Assoc. of Women Business Owners (representing \n     200 members), I would like to request the following actions \n     be taken regarding the SBA 7(a) program.\n       Absent the SBA asking congress for additional funding, \n     NAWBO supports increasing fees on lenders as an approach to \n     adequately fund the SBA 7(a) program and to lift \n     restrictions.\n       Specifically, NAWBO would like the program to:\n       Allow piggyback loans, but charge a 0.50 percent lender fee \n     for each;\n       Raise lender fees by 0.10 percent; and\n       For loans that are under $150,000, have lenders pay the SBA \n     the 0.25 percent fee that lenders currently keep for \n     themselves. This only applies to these small loans.\n       Thank you.\n                                                  Elaine Hamilton,\n                                              Public Policy Chair.\n\n                                S. 2186\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Haitian Refugee Immigration Fairness Act \nof 1998; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, seven years ago, I introduced \nthe Haitian Refugee Immigration Fairness Act of 1998 (HRIFA). I \nintroduced HRIFA after Congress enacted the Nicaraguan Adjustment and \nCentral American Relief Act (NACARA). NACARA enabled Nicaraguans and \nCubans to become permanent residents and permitted many unsuccessful \nCentral American and Eastern European asylum applicants to seek another \nform of immigration relief. At the time, Haitians were suffering brutal \nand widespread political persecution by a ruthless dictatorship. Yet \nlawmakers opted to exclude Haitian asylum seekers from the NACARA \nlegislation.\n  HRIFA became law with bipartisan support and reversed this grave \ninequity in U.S. immigration law. It allowed Haitians who had fled \npolitical turmoil in their country an opportunity to adjust their \nstatus like the opportunity we granted to refuges from other countries. \nThe legislation has been beneficial and nearly 11,000 Haitians have \nadjusted their status and become legal permanent residents of the \nUnited States. However HRIFA contained several flaws that undermine the \noriginal intent of the legislation. That is why today I am introducing \nthe HRIFA Improvement Act of 2004. I would like to thank my friend \nSenator\n\n[[Page S2549]]\n\nMike DeWine for taking the lead in co-sponsoring this bill and for his \ncontinued support and commitment to fairness in our immigration policy.\n  First, this legislation corrects an oversight that disqualified \nHaitian refugees who entered the country with falsified papers. Some \nHaitian refugees, like many who have fled repressive governments, used \nfalsified documents to flee their country when it was impossible for \nthem to get travel documents from their dictatorial government.\n  If you look at other immigration legislation, it is clear that the \nexclusion of Haitian refugees who came here with falsified documents is \nan oversight. NACARA allowed refugees from a long list of countries, \nincluding Guatemala, El Salvador, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and a \nnumber of others, to adjust their status to legal permanent residence, \neven if they entered the country with fraudulent documents.\n  As result of this oversight, many families and up to 5,000 American \nchildren face the possible deportation of a spouse, father or mother \nwho has worked for a decade or more to build a life and a family in the \nUnited States. There have been media reports, heart-rending stories, of \nparents facing the choice between forever leaving their American-born \nchildren in their safe communities and schools in the United States or \ntaking them back to a strife-torn Haiti where their parents risk \npolitical violence and persecution.\n  I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record an Associated Press \nstory from December 29, 2003, called ``Flaw in Law threatens \nDeportation for Haitian Refugees.'' The piece tells the story of Rigaud \nRene, a Haitian political activist now living in Miami. Mr. Rene faces \ndeportation because he fled Haiti in 1994 using doctored documents and \nis therefore not covered by HRIFA. Since coming here, Mr. Rene has \nlearned English, held down a job and earned his GED degree. He also \nmarried and has a one and a half year old American-born son.\n  If Mr. Rene is deported, he will be forced to take his U.S. citizen \nson with him or leave him here without any means of support. It is a \nsolomonic choice that Mr. Rene should not have to make, especially \nbecause his dilemma is the result of a simple oversight in the law.\n  The difference between the way we treat Haitians and the way we treat \nrefugees from other nations is inconsistent and unfair. The elimination \nof this kind of inconsistency and unfairness was the primary motivation \nfor the passage of HRIFA in 1998. Clearly, the exclusion of Haitians \nwho entered with falsified documents was an oversight that must now be \ncorrected.\n  The second purpose of the Improvement Act is to respond to another \nlegislative oversight that left Haitian children and dependents \nunprotected from ``aging out'' of HRIFA eligibility. HRIFA allows \nchildren and unmarried dependents of approved applicants to adjust to \nlegal permanent residency. However, the Bureau of Citizenship and \nImmigration Services has taken much longer than was expected to approve \nthe many applicants who had eligible children and dependents when they \napplied. As a result, many of those who would have been eligible had \ntheir parents or guardians been approved earlier have now ``aged out'' \nof eligibility or gotten married.\n  Currently, these ``aged out'' individuals face the immediate risk of \ndeportation. Their ineligibility is a result solely of administrative \ndelays and is neither their fault nor the intent of HRIFA. The \nImprovement Act addresses this unforeseen injustice by permitting these \nindividuals to apply for adjustment of status or move to have their \ncause reopened.\n  Finally, the HRIFA Improvement Act of 2004 also ensures fairness by \nextending the protection from deportation to applicants under this Act. \nThis is consistent with the protection extended to applicants under the \n1998 HRIFA legislation.\n  All those who come to the United States fleeing political persecution \nand violence deserve to be treated fairly and equally. This country is \nbuilt on this principle of justice and we should give everyone, \nregardless of his or her national origin, an equal opportunity. That is \nwhat this legislation intends to do.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Associated Press, Dec. 29, 2003]\n\n         Flaw in Law Threatens Deportation for Haitian Refugees\n\n                            (By Ken Thomas)\n\n       Nearly a decade after leaving Haiti, Regaud Rene ends each \n     day with a prayer. He gives thanks for his wife and young son \n     and their life in America--and prays that their time together \n     will endure.\n       Rene, a former political activist on the island, faces \n     deportation following a lengthy legal battle with immigration \n     authorities.\n       He says deportation would devastate his family, forcing him \n     to take his 1\\1/2\\-year-old American-born son to Haiti and \n     leave behind his wife. He also will lose a job that helps him \n     send about $300 a month to support family members in Haiti.\n       ``Some people pray to Jesus for miracles,'' Rene said \n     during a recent interview. ``They are not more special than \n     me. So I hope that God can help me, too.''\n       Rene, 41, is one of about 3,000 Haitian migrants ensnarled \n     in what activists call a flaw in a 1998 law to help provide \n     permanent residency--called green cards--to illegal aliens \n     from Haiti who lived in the United States before 1996.\n       The bill didn't include waivers for Haitian migrants known \n     as ``airplane refugees'' who used forged documents to flee \n     revengeful abuses and killings in the impoverished island \n     after President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the country's first \n     freely elected leader, was deposed in a 1991 coup by Gen. \n     Raul Cedras.\n       In Rene's case, immigration officials have maintained that \n     the altered documents make him ineligible to live here \n     legally because he committed fraud to enter the country.\n       But local activists contend that pro-Aristide Haitians \n     arriving by air had to use altered documents to escape \n     possible harm in Haiti because the U.S. Coast Guard was \n     interdicting refugees who came by sea and returning them.\n       ``All these people knew they were being looked for,'' said \n     Steven Forester, a senior policy advocate for the Haitian \n     Women of Miami, a nonprofit organization. ``If you're being \n     looked for by a regime that's chopping people's faces off, \n     you don't get into a boat.''\n       Those who worked on the 1998 Haitian bill said the \n     ``airplane refugees'' were not supposed to be left out. Paul \n     Virtue, who served as general counsel at the former INS in \n     1998-99, said he thought ``it was an oversight that they \n     were excluded.''\n       ``I don't think anyone really thought about the problem \n     that people would face who came by aircraft,'' Virtue said.\n       The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees \n     immigration, declined comment on Rene's case. But Dan Kane, a \n     department spokesman, stressed that every case is judged on \n     the individual merits of an applicant's arguments.\n       Rene initially sought asylum when he first entered the \n     United States in 1994 but was ordered deported by an \n     immigration judge for using a forged passport. His appeal was \n     pending when Congress passed the 1998 law to help Haitians. \n     Rene sought a green card under the new law but his claim was \n     rejected in July 2001.\n       He appealed the decision and Tuesday his case was sent back \n     to be reheard by an immigration judge. But Aristide's return \n     to power has weakened his argument in the past and his lawyer \n     cautions that Rene could be deported at any moment.\n       ``It's very desperate. They could pick him up today,'' said \n     Clarel Cyriaque, a Miami lawyer handling Rene's case.\n       Rene tried to get a green card through his wife, Sonie \n     Octalus, who came here in 1996 and is a legal permanent \n     resident, but the family failed to demonstrate deporting him \n     would result in an ``extreme hardship.''\n       U.S. Rep. Kendrick Meek, a Miami Democrat, introduced \n     legislation in October to expand the Haitian law to include \n     those who arrived by air and to prevent the government from \n     deporting anyone with a pending application. But Meek said it \n     faces an uncertain future.\n       Meek said ``the only real flicker of light'' would come if \n     the Bush administration embraces Homeland Security Secretary \n     Tom Ridge's recent suggestion of support for an amnesty for \n     illegal immigrants.\n       Thousands of Haitians have applied for green cards under \n     the 1998 Haitian Refugee Immigration Fairness Act. But the \n     majority of the cases have yet to be adjudicated. A U.S. \n     General Accounting Office report in October found that more \n     than 11,000 of the 37,851 applications have been approved.\n       Rene was an active Aristide supporter when the Haitian \n     priest ran for president in 1990. He led 300 Aristide \n     supporters in his hometown of Le Borgne and joined the pro-\n     Aristide National Front for Change in Democracy. He passed \n     out leaflets and photos supporting Aristide.\n       A month after the coup, Rene said he was visited at his \n     home by five members of the military. The men, who were \n     carrying revolvers, threatened him and pushed him around, \n     according to court documents. Rene then went into hiding for \n     two years, staying with a friend in the northern city of Cap-\n     Haitien.\n       ``I was scared to go back to Le Borgne. If I go back to Le \n     Borgne, anything could happen,'' he recalled.\n       He fled Haiti for the Bahamas by boat in early 1994 and \n     then used forged documents to fly to Miami International \n     Airport in May 1994, months before Aristide was returned to \n     power.\n\n[[Page S2550]]\n\n       Rene has built a new life in America, learning English at a \n     local Catholic church, working as a deli clerk at a Miami \n     Beach grocery store and taking night classes to earn a GED \n     degree.\n       Rene married Octalus in February 2001. Their son, Rikinson, \n     was born the following year. The family lives in a small one-\n     bedroom apartment, where a small bed sits in a cramped \n     living room cooled by a white box fan.\n       If Rene is deported, the couple will send Rikinson with him \n     because Octalus doesn't drive, has no other relatives in the \n     area and speaks limited English. But the decision has been \n     wrenching.\n       ``If they send him to Haiti, it's like telling me I might \n     as well go to Haiti, too,'' Octalus said, through a \n     translator in her native Creole.\n       The couple also wonders how they'll support their families \n     in Haiti if Rene is deported. Rene sends about $300 a month \n     to support two other children, two sisters and his mother. \n     His wife sends $500 a month to six sisters on the island, \n     paying their rent, school tuition and clothing.\n       The U.S. Agency for International Development estimates \n     Haitians living in the U.S. send between $700 million to $800 \n     million to Haiti every year. Forester, of Haitian Women of \n     Miami, worries about the impact on families in Haiti who lose \n     financial support when relatives are deported.\n       ``If they really want to send a message not to flee, what \n     they're doing by deporting these people is causing the very \n     migration outflow that they say they're trying to prevent,'' \n     Forester said.\n       A man of faith, Rene says his hopes have been reduced to \n     prayer. Prayer, he quips, is another part of the American \n     experience.\n       ``In God We Trust,'' Rene said with a smile. ``That's what \n     the Americans say.''\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself, Mr. McCain, and Mr. Daschle):\n  S. 2188. A bill to provide for reform of the Corps of Engineers, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Corps of \nEngineers Modernization and Improvement Act of 2004. I am pleased to be \njoined by the senior Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, who worked with \nme in the 107th Congress to reform the Corps. I also thank the senior \nSenator from South Dakota, Mr. Daschle, who, as the Democratic Leader, \nhas long supported Corps reform, for cosponsoring this legislation \ntoday.\n  As we debate the budget resolution this week, we cannot ignore the \nrecord-breaking deficits that the Nation faces. Fiscal responsibility \nhas never been so important. This legislation provides Congress with a \nunique opportunity to underscore our commitment to that goal. Time and \ntime again we have heard that fiscal responsibility and environmental \nprotection are mutually exclusive. Through this legislation, however, \nwe can save taxpayers billions of dollars and protect the environment. \nAs evidence of this unique opportunity, this bill is supported by \nTaxpayers for Common$ense, the National Taxpayers Union, the National \nWildlife Federation, American Rivers, the Corps Reform Network, and \nEarthjustice.\n  Reforming the Army Corps of Engineers will be a difficult task for \nCongress. It involves restoring credibility and accountability to a \nFederal agency rocked by scandals and constrained by endlessly growing \nauthorizations and a gloomy federal fiscal picture, and yet an agency \nthat Wisconsin, and many other states across the country, have come to \nrely upon. From the Great Lakes to the mighty Mississippi, the Corps is \ninvolved in providing aid to navigation, environmental remediation, \nwater control and a variety of other services in my state alone.\n  My office has strong working relationships with the Detroit, Rock \nIsland, and St. Paul District Offices that service Wisconsin, and I \nwant the fiscal and management cloud over the Corps to dissipate so \nthat the Corps can continue to contribute to our environment and our \neconomy.\n  This legislation evolved from my experience in seeking to offer an \namendment to the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 to create \nindependent review of Army Corps of Engineers' projects. In response to \nmy initiative, the bill's managers, which included the former Senator \nfrom New Hampshire, Senator Bob Smith, and the senior Senator from \nMontana, Mr. Baucus, adopted an amendment as part of their managers' \npackage to require a National Academy of Sciences study on the issue of \npeer review of Corps projects.\n  The bill I introduce today includes many provisions that were \nincluded in two bills, one of which I authored and the other I \ncosponsored, in the 107th Congress. It codifies the idea of independent \nreview of the Corps, which was investigated through the 2000 Water \nResources bill. It also provides a mechanism to speed up completion of \nconstruction for good Corps projects with large public benefits by \ndeauthorizing low priority and economically wasteful projects.\n  I will note, however, that this is not the first time that the \nCongress has realized that the Corps needs to be reformed because of \nits association with pork projects. In 1836, a House Ways and Means \nCommittee report discovered that at least 25 Corps projects were over \nbudget. In its report, the Committee noted that Congress must ensure \nthat the Corps institutes ``actual reform, in the further prosecution \nof public works.'' In 1902, Congress created a review board to \ndetermine whether Corps projects were justified. The review board was \ndismantled just over a decade ago, and the Corps is still linked with \nwasteful spending. Here we are, more than 100 years later, talking \nabout the same issue.\n  The reality is that the underlying problem is not with the Corps, the \nproblem is with Congress. All too often Members of Congress have seen \nCorps projects as a way to bring home the bacon, rather than ensuring \nthat taxpayers get the most bang for their federal buck.\n  This bill puts forth bold, comprehensive reform measures. It \nmodernizes the Corps project planning guidelines, which have not been \nupdated since 1983. It requires the Corps to use sound science in \nestimating the costs and evaluating the needs for water resources \nprojects. The bill clarifies that the national economic development and \nenvironmental protection are co-equal goals of the Corps. Furthermore, \nthe Corps must use current discount rates when determining the costs \nand benefits of projects. Several Corps projects are justified using a \ndiscount rate formula established in 1974, not the current government-\nwide discount rate promulgated by the Office of Management and Budget. \nBy using this outdated discount rate formula, the Corps often \noverestimates project benefits and underestimates project costs.\n  This legislation also requires that a water resource project's \nbenefits must be 1.5 times greater than the costs to the taxpayer. \nAccording to a 2002 study of the Corps backlog of projects, at least 60 \nCorps projects, whose combined costs total $4.6 billion, do not meet \nthis 1.5 to 1 benefit-cost ratio. Thus, this benefit-cost ratio will \nsave the taxpayer billions of dollars. The bill also mandates Federal-\nlocal cost sharing of inland waterways, flood control, and future beach \nrenourishment projects, and reduces the Federal cost burden of these \nprojects.\n  While the bill assumes a flat 50 percent cost-share for flood control \nprojects, my home state of Wisconsin has been on the forefront of \nresponsible flood plain management and also happens to be home to the \nAssociation of State Flood Plain Managers. As Congress considers the \nissue of Corps reform and the Water Resources Development Act, I hope \nmy colleagues will take a closer look at the issue of a sliding cost \nscale. We should explore the possibility of creating incentives for \ncommunities with cutting-edge flood plain management practices to \nreduce their local share for projects.\n  The bill requires independent review of Corps projects. The National \nAcademy of Sciences, the General Accounting Office, and even the \nInspector General of the Army agree that independent review is an \nessential step to assuring that each Corps project is economically \njustified. Independent review will apply to projects in the following \ncircumstances: 1. the project has costs greater than $25 million, \nincluding mitigation costs; 2. the Governor of a state that is affected \nby the project requests a panel; 3. the head of a Federal agency \ncharged with reviewing the project determines that the project is \nlikely to have a significant adverse environmental or cultural impact; \nor 4. the Secretary of the Army determines that the project is \ncontroversial. Any party can request that the Secretary make a \ndetermination of whether the project is controversial.\n  This bill also creates a Director of Independent Review within the \nOffice\n\n[[Page S2551]]\n\nof the Inspector General of the Department of the Army. The Director is \nresponsible for empaneling experts to review projects. The Secretary is \nrequired to respond to the panel's report and explain the extent to \nwhich a final report addresses the panel's concerns. The panel report \nand the underlying data that the Corps uses to justify the project will \nbe made available to the public.\n  The bill also requires strong environmental protection measures. The \nCorps is required to mitigate the environmental impacts of its projects \nin a variety of ways, including by avoiding damaging wetlands in the \nfirst place and either holding other lands or constructing wetlands \nelsewhere when it cannot avoid destroying them. The Corps requires \nprivate developers to meet this standard when they construct projects \nas a condition of receiving a federal permit, and I think the Federal \nGovernment should live up to the same standards. Too often, the Corps \ndoes not complete required mitigation and enhances environmental risks.\n  I feel very strongly that mitigation must be completed, that the true \ncosts of mitigation should be accounted for in Corps projects, and that \nthe public should be able to track the progress of mitigation projects. \nThe bill requires the Corps to develop a detailed mitigation plan for \neach water resources project, and conduct monitoring to demonstrate \nthat the mitigation is working. In addition, the concurrent mitigation \nrequirements of this bill would actually reduce the total mitigation \ncosts by ensuring the purchase of mitigation lands as soon as possible.\n\n  This bill streamlines the existing automatic deauthorization process. \nEstimates of the project backlog runs from $58 billion to $41 billion. \nUnder the bill a project authorized for construction but never started \nis deauthorized if it is denied appropriations funds towards completion \nof construction for five straight years. In addition, a project that \nhas begun construction but been denied appropriations funds towards \ncompletion for three straight years is deauthorized. The bill also \npreserves congressional prerogatives over setting the Corps' \nconstruction priorities by allowing Congress a chance to reauthorize \nany of these projects before they are automatically deauthorized. This \nprocess will be transparent to all interests, because the bill requires \nthe Corps to make a list of projects in the construction backlog \navailable to Congress and the public at large.\n  In the past decade, the Corps has routinely strayed from its mission \nof flood control, navigation, and environmental protection. This \nlegislation also requires that the Corps stick with its primary \nmissions and that any water project that does not have the Corps' \nprimary mission of flood control, navigation, or environmental \nprotection as its main objective will be deauthorized.\n  This legislation will bring out comprehensive revision of the project \nreview and authorization procedures at the Army Corps of Engineers. My \ngoals for the Corps are to increase transparency and accountability, to \nensure fiscal responsibility, and to allow greater stakeholder \ninvolvement in their projects. I remain committed to these goals, and \nto seeing Corps Reform enacted as part of this Congress's Water \nResources bill.\n  I feel that this bill is an important step down the road to a \nreformed Corps of Engineers. This bill establishes a framework to catch \nmistakes by Corps planners, deter any potential bad behavior by Corps \nofficials to justify questionable projects, end old unjustified \nprojects, and provide planners desperately needed support against the \nnever ending pressure of project boosters. Those boosters, include \ncongressional interests, which is why I believe that this body needs to \nchampion reform--to end the perception that Corps projects are all pork \nand no substance.\n  I wish it were the case that the changes we are proposing today were \nnot needed, but unfortunately, I see that there is need for this bill. \nI want to make sure that future Corps projects no longer fail to \nproduce predicted benefits, stop costing the taxpayers more than the \nCorps estimated, do not have unanticipated environmental impacts, and \nare built in an environmentally compatible way. This bill will help the \nCorps do a better job, which is what the taxpayers and the environment \ndeserve.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2188\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Madam President, I am pleased to join my friend, Senator \nFeingold in cosponsoring this important and timely legislation. Today, \nthe Senate is deliberating over the nation's budget priorities in the \nface of our enormous deficit.\n  Historically, Congress has considered water projects, costing many \nbillions of taxpayer dollars, as essential expenditures--regardless of \nthe environmental costs or public benefits. The reforms of the Corps of \nEngineers' procedures in this bill are designed to achieve more cost-\neffective expenditures for water projects that will yield more \nenvironmental, economic, and social benefits. The need for these \nchanges has been acknowledged by many for some time, but never has the \nneed to spend scarce taxpayer dollars wisely been as crucial as it is \nnow.\n  The Corps procedures for planning and approving projects, as well as \nthe Congressional system for funding projects, are broken, but they can \nbe effectively fixed. In fact, the reforms in this bill are based on \nthorough program analysis and common sense. I commend Senator Feingold \nfor building on the legislation we introduced with Senator Smith in the \nlast Congress to provide additional improvements. It is surprising that \nCongress hasn't already put these procedures in place, but there is no \ntime or need like the present.\n  Provisions of the legislation we are introducing today would modify \nthe Corps planning and approval procedures to consider both economic \nand environmental objectives. Independent review of Corps projects and \nan increase in the cost-benefit factor would ensure that only \nbeneficial projects are constructed. Effective measures for mitigation \nof environmental and other damage caused by projects would be required \nand monitored. The existing $56 billion project backlog is addressed \nand projects that have been suspended or never started for five years \nwould no longer be considered.\n  Water projects that provide economic and environmental benefits to \nour state citizens and all federal taxpayers serve the common good and \nreflect our common interest in fiscal responsibility. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BIDEN:\n  S. 2189. A bill to establish grants to improve and study the National \nDomestic Violence Hotline; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S2557]]\n\n                                S. 2189\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Domestic Violence \n     Connections Campaign Act of 2004''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) More than 500 men and women call the National Domestic \n     Violence Hotline every day to get immediate, informed, and \n     confidential assistance to help deal with family violence.\n       (2) The National Domestic Violence Hotline service is \n     available, toll-free, 24 hours a day and 7 days a week, with \n     bilingual staff, access to translators in 150 languages, and \n     a TTY line for the hearing-impaired.\n       (3) With access to over 5,000 shelters and service \n     providers across the United States, Puerto Rico, Alaska, \n     Hawaii, and the United States Virgin Islands, the National \n     Domestic Violence Hotline provides crisis intervention and \n     immediately connects callers with sources of help in their \n     local community.\n       (4) The National Domestic Violence Hotline, which was \n     created by the Violence Against Women Act and is located in \n     Austin, Texas, answered its first call on February 21, 1996, \n     and answered its one millionth call on August 4, 2003.\n       (5) Approximately 60 percent of the callers indicate that \n     calling the Hotline is their first attempt to address a \n     domestic violence situation and that they have not called the \n     police or any other support services.\n       (6) Between 2000 and 2003, there was a 27 percent increase \n     in call volume.\n       (7) Due to high call volume and limited resources, \n     approximately 26,000 calls to the Hotline went unanswered in \n     2002 due to long hold times or busy signals.\n       (8) Widespread demand for the Hotline service continues. \n     The Department of Justice reported that over 18,000 acts of \n     violence were committed by intimate partners in the United \n     States each day during 2001. An average of 3 women are \n     murdered every day in this Country by their husbands or \n     boyfriends.\n       (9) Working with outdated telephone and computer equipment \n     creates many challenges for the National Domestic Violence \n     Hotline.\n       (10) Improving technology infrastructure at the National \n     Domestic Violence Hotline and training advocates, volunteers, \n     and other staff on upgraded technology will drastically \n     increase the Hotline's ability to answer more calls quickly \n     and effectively.\n       (11) Partnerships between the public sector and the private \n     sector are an effective way of providing necessary technology \n     improvements to the National Domestic Violence Hotline.\n       (12) The Connections Campaign is a project that unites \n     nonprofit organizations, major corporations, and Federal \n     agencies to launch a major new initiative to help ensure that \n     the National Domestic Violence Hotline can answer every call \n     with upgraded, proficient, and sophisticated technology \n     tools.\n\n     SEC. 3. TECHNOLOGY GRANT TO NATIONAL DOMESTIC VIOLENCE \n                   HOTLINE.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Attorney General, in consultation with \n     the Secretary of Health and Human Services, shall award a \n     grant to the National Domestic Violence Hotline.\n       (b) Use of Funds.--The grant awarded under subsection (a) \n     shall be used to provide technology and telecommunication \n     training and assistance for advocates, volunteers, staff, and \n     others affiliated with the Hotline so that such persons are \n     able to effectively use improved equipment made available \n     through the Connections Campaign.\n\n     SEC. 4. RESEARCH GRANT TO STUDY NATIONAL DOMESTIC VIOLENCE \n                   HOTLINE.\n\n       (a) Grant Authorized.--Not later than 6 months after the \n     date of enactment of this Act, the Attorney General, in \n     consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     and the National Domestic Violence Hotline, shall award a \n     grant to a university or other research institution with \n     demonstrated experience and expertise with domestic violence \n     issues to conduct a study of the National Domestic Violence \n     Hotline for the purpose of conducting the research described \n     under subsection (c), and for the input, interpretation, and \n     dissemination of research data.\n       (b) Application.--Each university or research institution \n     desiring to receive a grant under this section shall submit \n     an application to the Attorney General, at such time, in such \n     manner, and accompanied by such additional information as the \n     Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary of \n     Health and Human Services and the National Domestic Violence \n     Hotline, may reasonably require.\n       (c) Issues to be Studied.--The study described in \n     subsection (a) shall--\n       (1) compile statistical and substantive information about \n     calls received by the Hotline since its inception, or a \n     representative sample of such calls, while maintaining the \n     confidentiality of Hotline callers;\n       (2) interpret the data compiled under paragraph (1)--\n       (A) to determine the trends, gaps in services, and \n     geographical areas of need; and\n       (B) to assess the trends and gaps in services to \n     underserved communities and the military community; and\n       (3) gather other important information about domestic \n     violence.\n       (d) Report.--Not later than 3 years after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the grantee conducting the study under \n     this section shall submit a report on the results of such \n     study to Congress and the Attorney General.\n\n     SEC. 5. GRANT TO RAISE PUBLIC AWARENESS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE \n                   ISSUES.\n\n       (a) Grant Authorized.--Not later than 6 months after the \n     submission of the report required under section 4(d), the \n     Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary of \n     Health and Human Services and the National Domestic Violence \n     Hotline, shall award a grant to an experienced organization \n     to conduct a public awareness campaign to increase the \n     public's understanding of domestic violence issues and \n     awareness of the National Domestic Violence Hotline.\n       (b) Application.--Each organization desiring to receive a \n     grant under this section shall submit an application to the \n     Attorney General, at such time, in such manner, and \n     accompanied by such additional information as the Attorney \n     General, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and \n     Human Services and the National Domestic Violence Hotline, \n     may reasonably require.\n\n     SEC. 6. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--There are authorized to be appropriated, \n     for each of the fiscal years 2005 and 2006--\n       (1) $500,000 to carry out section 3;\n       (2) $250,000 to carry out section 4; and\n       (3) $800,000 to carry out section 5.\n       (b) Availability.--Any amounts appropriated pursuant to the \n     authority of subsection (a) shall remain available until \n     expended.\n       (c) Nonexclusivity.--Nothing in this section shall be \n     construed to limit or restrict the National Domestic Violence \n     Hotline to apply for and obtain Federal funding from any \n     other agency or department or any other Federal grant \n     program.\n       (d) No Condition on Appropriations.--Amounts appropriated \n     pursuant to subsection (a) shall not be considered amounts \n     appropriated for purposes of the conditions imposed under \n     section 316(g)(2) of the Family Violence Prevention and \n     Services Act (42 U.S.C. 10416(g)(2)).\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I want to relay a telephone number, a \nnumber that may not sound familiar but you can be sure is memorized by \nthousands of women across the country. 1-800-799-SAFE--the number for \nthe National Domestic Violence Hotline. Each month, over 16,000 women \nand men call the National Domestic Violence Hotline. Open twenty-four \nhours a day, seven days a week, with a bilingual staff and a TTY-line \nfor the hearing impaired, the National Domestic Violence Hotline \nprovides immediate, informed and confidential assistance to those \ncaught in family violence. Oftentimes, it is the first call a battered \nwoman makes, even before calling the police or a friend.\n  The Hotline is located in Austin, TX, but answers telephone calls \nplaced anywhere in the United States and the U.S. territories. A \ndistressed caller is connected to a trained advocate who is able to \nprovide crisis intervention counseling, help create a safety plan, \ndirectly connect the caller with a local shelter or provide a range of \nlocal referral information. Using a massive database listing more than \n5,000 services nationally, one of 30 full or part-time advocates puts a \ncaller in touch immediately with local programs offering shelter and \ndirect care.\n  I want to share with my colleagues two real-life stories from women \nwho have called the Hotline. One caller dialed the Hotline after her \nboyfriend pulled a gun and threatened to kill her if she left him. \nFearing for her life, she fled with her two young children. They ran to \na nearby strip mall where she called the Hotline. As she told a Hotline \nadvocate her story, she watched her abuser search for her in every \nstore in the mall. Once a local shelter was contacted, arrangements \nwere made to rescue the woman and her children from their hiding spot \nin a back alley behind the restaurant.\n  An immigrant woman who spoke no English called from a community \nclinic. She had learned that for the past year her abusive husband had \nbeen raping their 15-year-old daughter. Her husband had no idea she was \ncalling the Hotline. He had kept her so isolated on the ranch where \nthey lived that she didn't even know her address. While the woman \nstayed on the line, an advocate contacted the sheriff's office and \ntogether they pieced together enough information to figure out her \naddress. The sheriff made plans to confirm the child abuse at the \ndaughter's school, after which the husband would be arrested \nimmediately. After completing the exchange with the sheriff's office, \nthe advocate contacted the nearest shelter and arranged to pick up the \nwoman and her daughter at the clinic.\n  These are real women who we see every day at work, at the grocery \nstore\n\n[[Page S2558]]\n\nand at the school parking lot whose lives have been dramatically \nchanged, in part, by that first call to the National Domestic Violence \nHotline. Created by the Violence Against Women Act, the Hotline \nanswered its first call on February 21, 1996, and its one millionth \ncall on August 4, 2003. In the past decade we've witnessed a sea of \nchange in how Americans view domestic violence. It is no longer treated \nas a private, family matter, but as a public crime. As public awareness \nhas grown--as the Hotline's telephone number is posted on bus \nbillboards and websites, in school offices and doctor's waiting rooms--\nthere has been a dramatic increase in calls. Between 2000 and 2001 \nalone, call volume increased by 18.5 percent. In 2002, the Hotline \nanswered almost 180,000 calls, an increase of 7.5 percent from the \nprevious year. The Department of Defense recently requested that the \nHotline accept calls from military personnel--a move that will \ncertainly increase the call volume substantially.\n\n  While the majority of the Hotline's day-to-day operating costs are \npaid with Federal dollars designated in annual spending bills, funding \nhas not kept pace with the growing call volume and the Hotline's \ntechnology and telecommunication needs. This year, the spending bill \nappropriated only three million dollars to the Hotline. Older \nequipment, coupled with increased usage, has set the Hotline up to \nexperience frequent problems with the network, data corruption and the \nlurking threat of a crash in the entire system. The Hotline tries to \nanswer almost 500 calls a day with old computers and servers. Because \nthe system is outdated and the staff is stretched thin, over 26,000 \ncalls last year went unanswered due to long hold times or busy signals.\n  We need to answer each and every one of the calls to the Hotline. \nToday I am launching an innovative and far-reaching solution to the \nHotline's problems, the Connections Campaign. The Connections Campaign \nis a public/private partnership that teams up private telecommunication \nand technology companies with the Federal Government to solve the \nHotline's crisis. Under the Connections Campaign, the same companies--\nMicrosoft, Sony, BellSouth, Verizon Wireless, IBM, Nortel Networks, \nDell and others--that supply Americans with home computers, cell phones \nand telephone service are donating hardware and software to the \nHotline. Items like mapping software, networked computers, servers, \nflat-screened monitors and telephone airtime are being pledged to the \nHotline. This is just the beginning of a multi-year, multi-million \ndollar initiative to place the Hotline squarely in the twenty-first \ncentury.\n  On the public side of the partnership, I am proud to introduce the \nDomestic Violence Connections Campaign Act of 2004 which will provide a \nmillion dollars to train and assist the Hotline's advocates so that \nthey may effectively use the improved equipment provided by the \nConnections Campaign. In addition, the Act creates a new research grant \nprogram to be administered by the Attorney General that will review and \nanalyze data generated by the Hotline. Taking into consideration needs \nfor caller confidentiality and security, researchers will study Hotline \ndata to determine the trends, potential gaps in service and \ngeographical areas of need. Within three years of enactment, \nresearchers will release a comprehensive Hotline study to Congress and \nthe Attorney General. Finally, my bill provides an $800,000 grant \nprogram for the Hotline to increase public awareness about domestic \nviolence and the Hotline's services.\n  One hand clapping simply does not make enough noise. Federal, State \nand local government cannot always supply all the answers and resources \nto resolve our communities' pressing problems. Today's Connections \nCampaign recognizes that big problems warrant grand, collaborative \nsolutions. Cooperation between the Federal Government and the private \nsector is critical to enhance the National Domestic Violence Hotline.\n\n  A cornerstone of the Violence Against Women Act was my conviction \nthat ending domestic violence and sexual assault required a \ncoordinated, community response. We worked hard to ensure that \nemergency room personnel, police officers, victim advocates, shelter \ndirectors and court clerks worked together to implement the many \nmandates of the Violence Against Women Act. The Connections Campaign is \nAct Two. We are now asking that the corporate community get actively \ninvolved to strengthen a key safety net for women and their families, \nthe National Domestic Violence Hotline.\n  Today's legislation and the kick-off is just the beginning of what I \nenvision to be a lasting connection between the Hotline and the \ntechnology and telecommunications community. I look forward to coming \nback to the Senate floor to inform my colleagues about the new \ncomputers, wireless headsets, upgraded software and other technology \nthat could be provided to the Hotline through the Connections Campaign. \nIn the meantime, let me close by commending and expressing my gratitude \nto Sheryl Cates, the director of the Hotline and her dedicated staff \nwho are providing the first step to safe, new lives for millions of \nbattered women. They are truly doing God's work.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INHOFE:\n  S. 2190. A bill to implement equal protection under the 14th article \nof amendment to the Constitution for the right to life of each born and \npreborn human person; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I rise today to introduce the Life at \nConception Act. This bill is of utmost importance to future generations \nin America. Quite simply, it implements equal protection under the \nFourteenth Amendment of the Constitution for every born and pre-born \nperson. It protects Americans' right to life by defining the term \n``human person'' as an individual at all stages of life, including, but \nnot limited to, the moment of conception.\n  The Constitution's Fourteenth Amendment grants that no ``state \ndeprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process \nof law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal \nprotection of the laws.'' Furthermore, it grants ``Congress shall have \npower to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this \narticle.'' It is time that we, the Congress, start enforcing this \nprovision, start defending the Constitution, and start defending \nAmerican lives.\n  Even the Justices in the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision conceded this \npoint by making the admission: ``If this suggestion of personhood is \nestablished, the appellant's case [Roe], of course, collapses, for the \nfetus' right to life is then guaranteed specifically by the \n[Fourteenth] Amendment.'' Our Constitution is designed to protect the \nrights of all Americans, and give them the right to live and succeed. \nRight now, significant portions of Americans, who have no voice, are \nbeing killed, despite the explicit protections in the Fourteenth \nAmendment. Since 1973, more than 44 million babies have been sentenced \nto death without trial. We cannot tolerate this atrocity.\n  Additionally, a 1999 Wirthlin poll found that 62 percent of Americans \nsupport legal abortion only in cases of rape, incest, or if the \nmother's life is in danger. How can we stand by and let so many \nchildren die even when public opinion is on our side? It is our role as \nlegislators to uphold and enforce the Constitution, and it is our role \nas humans to defend those who cannot defend themselves. I urge my \ncolleagues to follow their conscience, support this bill, and do what \nis right for America and for humanity.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Kohl, and Mr. \n        Feingold):\n  S. 2192. A bill to amend title 35, United States Code, to promote \ncooperative research involving universities, the public sector, and \nprivate enterprises; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Cooperative \nResearch and Technology Enhancement Act of 2004 (the CREATE Act). This \nbill makes a narrow, but important change in our patent laws to ensure \nthat the American public will benefit from the results of collaborative \nresearch efforts that combine the erudition of great public \nuniversities with the entrepreneurial savvy of private enterprises.\n\n[[Page S2559]]\n\n  Together, our universities and private enterprises have created a \nculture of innovation that has become America's greatest asset in an \nincreasingly global economy. This culture of innovation encourages \nfundamental research--knowledge for its own sake. It also encourages \nthe hard work needed to incorporate new advances in technology into \nactual products that reach the market and benefit consumers.\n  While universities and private entrepreneurs can play complementary \nroles in our innovation economy, new opportunities to innovate arise \nwhen public institutions and private entrepreneurs combine their \nrespective forms of expertise in collaborative, joint research efforts. \nPresident Lincoln would surely agree that this type of joint private-\npublic research effort is well-suited to add ``the fuel of interest to \nthe fire of genius in the production of new and useful things.''\n  As a result, we have long realized the enormous value of these joint \nresearch efforts, and we have long realized that their potential cannot \nbe realized unless their participants can benefit from the intellectual \nproperty rights generated by such research. Unfortunately, the literal \nlanguage of Section 102(g) of the Patent Act suggests that non-public \ninformation known to some members of a private-public research team can \nconstitute ``prior art'' that may make the final results of the team \nresearch obvious, and thus not patentable. Because non-public \ninformation does not usually constitute ``prior art'' under the Patent \nAct, the potentially disparate treatment of such information crates a \ndisincentive for entrepreneurs and public institutions to collaborate \nin joint research efforts.\n  I believe that we must encourage--not discourage--public institutions \nand private entrepreneurs to combine their respective talents in joint \nresearch efforts. Indeed, Congress committed itself to this principle \nwhen it passed the Bayh-Dole Amendments to the Patent Act. The CREATE \nAct will simply conform the present language of the Patent Act to the \nintent that has always animated it.\n  For the above reasons, I urge my colleagues to support the \nCooperative Research and Technology Enhancement Act of 2004. I also \nthank my colleagues in the House Committee on the Judiciary, \nparticularly Subcommittee Chairman Lamar Smith and Chairman James \nSensenbrenner, for their groundbreaking work on this important issue.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 2192\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Cooperative Research and \n     Technology Enhancement (CREATE) Act of 2004''.\n\n     SEC. 2. COLLABORATIVE EFFORTS ON CLAIMED INVENTIONS.\n\n       Section 103(c) of title 35, United States Code, is amended \n     to read as follows:\n       ``(c)(1) Subject matter developed by another person, which \n     qualifies as prior art only under one or more of subsections \n     (e), (f), and (g) of section 102 of this title, shall not \n     preclude patentability under this section where the subject \n     matter and the claimed invention were, at the time the \n     claimed invention was made, owned by the same person or \n     subject to an obligation of assignment to the same person.\n       ``(2) For purposes of this subsection, subject matter \n     developed by another person and a claimed invention shall be \n     deemed to have been owned by the same person or subject to an \n     obligation of assignment to the same person if--\n       ``(A) the claimed invention was made by or on behalf of \n     parties to a joint research agreement that was in effect on \n     or before the date the claimed invention was made;\n       ``(B) the claimed invention was made as a result of \n     activities undertaken within the scope of the joint research \n     agreement; and\n       ``(C) the application for patent for the claimed invention \n     discloses or is amended to disclose the names of the parties \n     to the joint research agreement.\n       ``(3) For purposes of paragraph (2), the term `joint \n     research agreement' means a written contract, grant, or \n     cooperative agreement entered into by two or more persons or \n     entities for the performance of experimental, developmental, \n     or research work in the field of the claimed invention.''.\n\n     SEC. 3. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       (a) In General.--The amendments made by this Act shall \n     apply to any patent granted on or after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act.\n       (b) Special Rule.--The amendments made by this Act shall \n     not affect any final decision of a court or the United States \n     Patent and Trademark Office rendered before the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, and shall not affect the right of any \n     party in any action pending before the United States Patent \n     and Trademark Office or a court on the date of the enactment \n     of this Act to have that party's rights determined on the \n     basis of the provisions of title 35, United States Code, in \n     effect on the day before the date of the enactment of this \n     Act.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, the United States has from its inception \nrecognized the importance of intellectual property laws in fostering \ninnovation, and vested in Congress the responsibility of crafting laws \nthat ensure that those who produce inventions are able to reap economic \nrewards for their efforts. Today, Senator Hatch, Senator Kohl, Senator \nFeingold, and I introduce the ``Cooperative Research and Technology \nEnhancement, CREATE, Act of 2004,'' legislation that will provide a \nneeded remedy to one aspect of our nation's patent laws.\n  When Congress passed the Bayh-Dole Act in 1980, the law encouraged \nprivate entities and not-for-profits such as universities to form \ncollaborative partnerships in order to spur innovation. Prior to the \nenactment of this law, universities were issued fewer than 250 patents \neach year. That this number has in recent years surpassed two thousand \nis owed in large measure to the Bayh-Dole Act. The innovation this law \nencouraged has contributed billions of dollars annually to the United \nStates economy and has produced hundreds of thousands of jobs.\n  However, one component of the Bayh-Dole Act, when read literally, \nruns contrary to the intent of that legislation. In 1999, the United \nStates Court of Appeal for the Federal Circuit ruled, in Oddzon \nProducts, Inc. v. Just Toys, Inc., that non-public information may in \ncertain cases be considered ``prior art'' a standard which generally \nprevents an inventor from obtaining a patent. Thus some collaborative \nteams that the Bayh-Dole Act was intended to encourage have been unable \nto obtain patents for their efforts. The result is a disincentive to \nform this type of partnership, which could have a negative impact on \nthe U.S. economy and hamper the development of new creations.\n  However, the Federal circuit in its ruling invited Congress to better \nconform the language of the Bayh-Dole Act to the intent of the \nlegislation. The ``CREATE Act'' does exactly that by ensuring that non-\npublic information is not considered ``prior art'' when the information \nis used in a collaborative partnership under the Bayh-Dole Act. The \nbill that my colleagues and I are today offering also includes strict \nevidentiary burdens to ensure that the legislation is tailored narrowly \nin order to solely fulfill the intent of the Bayh-Dole Act. I ask that \nmy colleagues support the ``Cooperative Research and Technology \nEnhancement Act of 2004.''\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Mr. Bond):\n  S. 2193. A bill to improve small business loan programs, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill to revitalize a \nloan program crucial to the growth of small businesses in this country, \nand therefore crucial to our country's economy. This bill, the ``Smart \nBusiness Loan Revitalization Act of 2004,'' provides improvements to \nthe Small Business Administration's largest business loan program, the \n``Section 7(a)'' program.\n  This program proves that a small amount of government backing can \ngreatly enhance private-sector financing for small businesses, and that \nthe economic benefits can reverberate throughout the economy at large. \nMore than $46.6 billion in 7(a) loans have been provided to small \nbusinesses over the last five Fiscal Years. This financing has helped \nsmall businesses to create or retain nearly 2 million more jobs over \nthis five-year period.\n  Today, we are losing thousands of American jobs to outsourcing and \noff-shore manufacturing. We measure net job increases in the ``few \nthousands.'' Given these circumstances, it is clearly to our advantage, \nand to the advantage\n\n[[Page S2560]]\n\nof the American people, to support improvements to any program that has \nalready demonstrated an ability to create or retain nearly 400,000 \nAmerican jobs a year.\n  Last year this program provided $11.2 billion in loans to small \nbusiness owners and employees in towns and communities across America. \nThis year, however, the SBA only requested a program size of $9.3 \nbillion. The fact that the SBA received a larger appropriation than the \n$9.3 billion it requested is powerful testament to the popularity of \nthis program among small businesses. The SBA received sufficient \nappropriations, $79 million, coupled with $22 million in carried-over \nfunds, to allow for a $9.55 billion program.\n  Like last year, however, the demand for program funds in the first \nfew months of Fiscal Year 2004 suggested that requests for the entire \nyear would most likely exceed $11 billion. As a result, in January, \n2004, the SBA shut the program down, and then reopened it with a \ndiminished loan cap of $750,000--37.5 percent of the $2 million maximum \npreviously available. Faced with these restrictions, small businesses \nhave urged Congress and the Administration to make the program fully \noperational for the rest of 2004.\n  To this end, I have worked with a coalition of small businesses and \nlenders to construct a plan to improve the program for the remainder of \nthis Fiscal Year. The plan would allow lenders to help alleviate the \nfunding shortfall. It would benefit small businesses and lenders by \nallowing loans larger than $750,000, and by allowing loans with \nmultiple participations.\n  The bill would achieve these goals in three ways. First, lenders \nwould return to the SBA a fee of 0.25 percent (or one-quarter of one \npercent) of new loans under $150,000, a fee that lenders are currently \npermitted to retain. Lenders may only retain this fee for loans of \n$150,000 or less--for loans greater than that size, lenders must return \nthe fee to the SBA, as they have been required to do since the \ninception of the program. This proposal was first made by the SBA, as \npart of a larger plan the SBA recently submitted to Congress.\n  Second, a lender fee on new loans would be increased from 0.25 \npercent, one-quarter of one percent, to 0.35 percent. Finally, lenders \nwould be permitted to provide small businesses with financing packages \nthat include a 7(a) loan portion and a non-7(a), a strictly commercial \nportion, if the lenders paid the normal fees on the 7(a) loan portion \nand a 0.50 percent fee on the non-7(a) portion. Prior to January 2004, \nthe SBA permitted this type of financing, but without receiving any fee \nincome for the non-7(a) portion, and without an upper limit on the \ntotal financing, which I have set at $4 million.\n  The ability of small businesses to receive loans larger than $750,000 \nis a prerequisite to reviving the American economy. These loans provide \nneeded capital for significant purchases and development by small \nbusinesses. More 7(a) loans represent longer-term loans than similar \nproducts available in the private capital market, and this allows small \nbusinesses to repay their 7(a) loans more gradually. I applaud the SBA \nfor its desire to make more small loans to entrepreneurs without large \ncapital needs, but I also urge the SBA to remember those entrepreneurs \nand small businesses who need more financing to strengthen and grow \ntheir enterprise, and to hire more employees. After encouraging \nentrepreneurs to start new small businesses, we cannot afford to forget \ntheir small businesses, or profess an inability to assist them when \nthey need additional financing to grow.\n  The benefits of this program are clear. It has the ability to help \nentrepreneurs to create jobs, to fulfill their dreams, and to support \ntheir families--all of this while building the kinds of energetic \nbusinesses our economy so desperately needs. The demands for this \nprogram is also clear. Small businesses have submitted more \napplications than the program could handle so far this year. The \nwillingness of lenders to pay increased fees to meet the demand from \nsmall businesses for 7(a) loans is clear evidence the program works and \nremains attractive to lenders.\n  The question we must answer now is whether we are willing to respond \nto small businesses and lenders and implement a solution which they \nhave asked for, and which promises dividends for all involved, or \nwhether we will ignore their requests, and miss an opportunity to \ntransform a loan program that sustains almost 400,000 jobs a year into \nan initiative capable of creating two, three, four or even five times \nthat amount. I don't want to miss that opportunity, my constituents in \nMaine can't afford to miss that opportunity, and I don't believe that \nyour constituents can either. Almost every company listed today on the \nAmerican Stock Exchange began as a small business. In the short term, \nthis bill may save American jobs. But in the long term, it may save the \nAmerican economy.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2193\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 317\n\n       Whereas the Autism Society of America, Cure Autism Now, the \n     National Alliance for Autism Research, Unlocking Autism, and \n     numerous other organizations commemorate April as National \n     Autism Awareness Month;\n       Whereas autism is a developmental disorder that is \n     typically diagnosed during the first 3 years of life, robbing \n     individuals of their ability to communicate and interact with \n     others;\n       Whereas autism affects an estimated 1 in every 250 children \n     in America;\n       Whereas autism is 4 times more likely in boys than in \n     girls, and can affect anyone, regardless of race, ethnicity, \n     or other factors;\n       Whereas the cost of specialized treatment in a \n     developmental center for people with autism is approximately \n     $80,000 per individual per year;\n       Whereas the cost of special education programs for school-\n     aged children with autism is often more than $30,000 per \n     individual per year;\n       Whereas the cost nationally of caring for persons affected \n     by autism is estimated at more than $90,000,000,000 per year; \n     and\n       Whereas despite the fact that autism is one of the most \n     common developmental disorders, many professionals in the \n     medical and educational fields are still unaware of the best \n     methods to diagnose and treat the disorder: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the establishment of April as National Autism \n     Awareness Month;\n       (2) recognizes and commends the parents and relatives of \n     children with autism for their sacrifice and dedication in \n     providing for the special needs of children with autism and \n     for absorbing significant financial costs for specialized \n     education and support services;\n       (3) supports the goal of increasing Federal funding for \n     aggressive research to learn the root causes of autism, \n     identify the best methods of early intervention and \n     treatment, expand programs for individuals with autism across \n     their lifespan, and promote understanding of the special \n     needs of people with autism;\n       (4) commends the Department of Health and Human Services \n     for the swift implementation of the Children's Health Act of \n     2000, particularly for establishing 4 ``Centers of \n     Excellence'' at the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention to study the epidemiology of autism and related \n     disorders and the proposed ``Centers of Excellence'' at the \n     National Institutes of Health for autism research;\n       (5) stresses the need to begin early intervention services \n     soon after a child has been diagnosed with autism, noting \n     that early intervention strategies are the primary \n     therapeutic options for young people with autism, and early \n     intervention significantly improves outcomes for people with \n     autism and can reduce the level of funding and services \n     needed later in life;\n       (6) supports the Federal Government's nearly 30-year-old \n     commitment to provide States with 40 percent of the costs \n     needed to educate children with disabilities under part B of \n     the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA);\n       (7) recognizes the shortage of appropriately trained \n     teachers who have the skills and support necessary to teach, \n     assist, and respond to special needs students, including \n     those with autism, in our school systems; and\n       (8) recognizes the importance of worker training programs \n     that are tailored to the needs of developmentally disabled \n     persons, including those with autism, and notes that people \n     with autism can be, and are, productive members of the \n     workforce if they are given appropriate support, training, \n     and early intervention services.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/10/senate-section/article/S2561-2", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2561-S2563]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2719.

SENSE OF THE SENATE TO MAKE MORE EFFICIENT, \n                   FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE APPROPRIATIONS AND REVENUE \n                   DECISIONS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) Federal programs and policies directly influence local \n     growth patterns through the location of Federal facilities, \n     spending on\n\n[[Page S2566]]\n\n     public infrastructure, tax incentives, and Federal \n     regulations.\n       (2) This Federal influence on local land use decisions \n     results in both positive and negative effects.\n       (3) Unplanned and random growth results in increased \n     commuting times, traffic congestion, impaired air quality, \n     loss of open space and environmentally sensitive areas, \n     public health problems, and poor accessibility to critical \n     services such as schools and hospitals.\n       (4) Investing in existing infrastructure is a fiscally \n     responsible use of resources. When not properly planned, \n     local development decisions may actually burden the Federal \n     budget by requiring the construction of new water, sewer, and \n     transportation infrastructure in low-density areas, rather \n     than funding the maintenance of existing infrastructure.\n       (5) Planned growth, important in sustaining community \n     development and a healthy economy, has positive effects, \n     reflected, for example, in increased home ownership, higher \n     consumer savings, lower energy consumption, and strong \n     business advantages.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the budgetary levels in this resolution assume that in \n     making appropriations and revenue decisions, the Senate \n     should--\n       (1) support Federal policies that encourage growth patterns \n     that make efficient use of available housing, transportation, \n     and infrastructure resources; and\n       (2) address the unintended consequences of urban and \n     suburban sprawl resulting from specific Federal programs and \n     policies through the use of additional resources and the \n     allocation of budgetary authority to provide incentives for \n     sustainable growth.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 2730.

FINDINGS AND SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the United States is in the grip of pervasively higher \n     natural gas prices;\n       (2) high natural gas prices are, in general, having an \n     effect that is rippling through the United States economy and \n     are, in particular, impacting home energy bills;\n       (3) while persons in many sectors can adapt to gas price \n     increases, persons in some sectors simply cannot;\n       (4) elderly and disabled citizens who are living on fixed \n     incomes, low-income individuals, and the working poor face \n     hardships wrought by natural gas prices;\n       (5) the energy burden for persons among the working poor \n     often exceeds 40 percent of those persons' incomes under \n     normal conditions;\n\n[[Page S2571]]\n\n       (6) under current circumstances, natural gas prices are \n     unnaturally high, and those are not normal circumstances;\n       (7) while critically important and encouraged, State energy \n     assistance and charitable assistance funds have been \n     overwhelmed by the crisis caused by the high gas prices;\n       (8) the Federal Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program \n     (referred to in this section as ``LIHEAP'') and the companion \n     weatherization assistance program (referred to in this \n     section as ``WAP''), are the Federal Government's primary \n     means to assist eligible low-income individuals in the United \n     States to shoulder the burdens caused by their home heating \n     and cooling needs;\n       (9) in 2003, LIHEAP reached only 15 percent of the persons \n     in the United States who were eligible for assistance under \n     the program;\n       (10) since LIHEAP's inception, its inflation-adjusted \n     buying power has eroded by 58 percent;\n       (11) the aggressive draw-down of Federal funds from LIHEAP \n     to address legitimate winter heating demands has led to a \n     subsequent cooling crisis that will be manifest later this \n     year; and\n       (12) more individuals in the United States succumb to \n     extreme heat than all other weather phenomena combined.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this concurrent resolution assume--\n       (1) an authorization of $3,400,000,000 for each of fiscal \n     years 2004 through 2006 to carry out the LIHEAP program;\n       (2) an authorization of $325,000,000 for fiscal year 2004, \n     $400,000,000 for fiscal year 2005, and $500,000,000 for \n     fiscal year 2006 to carry out the WAP program;\n       (3) appropriations, for those programs, of sufficient \n     additional funds to realistically address the immediate \n     heating crisis, and the cooling crisis that awaits the United \n     States this summer, as well as the systemic shortfalls that \n     have plagued those programs and the eligible individuals that \n     the programs are designed to assist; and\n       (4) advance appropriations of the necessary funds to ensure \n     the smooth operation of those programs during times of peak \n     demand.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 2753.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING FUNDING FOR PORT \n                   SECURITY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) In the United States, the system of maritime commerce, \n     including seaports and other ports, is a critical element of \n     the United States economic, social, and environmental \n     infrastructure.\n       (2) In 2001, ports in the United States handled \n     approximately 5,400 ships, the majority of which were owned \n     by foreign persons and crewed by nationals of foreign \n     countries, that made a total of more than 60,000 calls at \n     such ports.\n       (3) In a typical year, more than 17,000,000 cargo \n     containers are handled at ports in the United States.\n       (4) Maritime commerce is the primary mode of transportation \n     for international trade, with ships carrying more than 80 \n     percent of such trade, by volume.\n       (5) Disruption of trade flowing through United States ports \n     could have a catastrophic impact on both the United States \n     and the world economies.\n       (6) In addition to the economic importance of United States \n     ports, such ports form a critical link in the United States \n     national security structure, and are necessary to ensure that \n     United States military material can be effectively and \n     quickly shipped to any location where such material is \n     needed.\n       (7) Terrorist groups, including extremist groups such as al \n     Qaeda, are likely to consider, formulate, and execute plans \n     to conduct a terrorist strike against one or more of the \n     ports in the United States.\n       (8) Terrorists have conducted attacks against maritime \n     commerce in the past, including the October 2002 attack on \n     the French oil tanker LIMBERG and the October 2000 attack on \n     the USS COLE in Yemen.\n       (9) It is critical that port security be enhanced and \n     improved through the adoption of better formulated security \n     procedures, the adoption of new regulations and law, and \n     investment in long-term capital improvements to the structure \n     of the United States most critical ports.\n       (10) Effective funding to provide adequate security at \n     United States ports requires a commitment to provide Federal \n     funds over multiple years to fund long-term capital \n     improvement projects.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the budget of the United States should provide adequate \n     funding for port security projects and not less than the \n     amount of such funding that is adequate to implement an \n     effective port security plan;\n       (2) the implementation of the budget of the United States \n     should permit the provision of Federal funds over multiple \n     years to fund long-term security improvement projects at \n     ports in the United States; and\n       (3) the Secretary of Homeland Security should, as soon as \n     practicable, develop a funding plan for port security that \n     permits funding over multiple years for such projects.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 2754.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nJudiciary Committee be discharged from further consideration of H. Con. \nRes 355, and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration. It is \nhonoring the University of Delaware football team.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will state the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 355) congratulating \n     the University of Delaware men's football team for winning \n     the National College Athletic Association Division I-AA \n     National Championship.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to the concurrent \nresolution.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, having been here over 30 years, I \nunderstand the Senate rules and that you are not allowed to refer to \nanybody sitting in the gallery. So I will not refer to the fact that \nanybody is sitting in the gallery.\n  I stand here with great pride that my alma mater, the University of \nDelaware, has won the national football championship for Division I-AA. \nIn my 32 years serving in the Senate for Delaware, I have had the \nopportunity to give hundreds of speeches on the Senate floor. We have \nmuch more, though, than a national championship to celebrate. With our \nnickname, the Fighting Blue Hens, when we were recruited by the \nUniversity of Delaware, we probably wished they had some other name \nlike the Fighting Tigers or something; but we are Blue Hens. But we are \nthe Blue Hens, and we are proud of the fact that year in and year out \nwe have this long tradition of having a first-rate football team. But \nnone like this team.\n\n  This team played one of the most outstanding seasons in college \nfootball history with a record of 15 to 1 and setting a school record \nfor victories in any single season.\n  After clinching their seventh Atlantic 10 Football Conference \nChampionship, the 2003 squad sailed through the division I-AA playoffs \noutscoring our opponents with a combined score of 149 points to 23.\n  In fact, they won the championship game by shutting down--and since \nour Parliamentarian is a graduate, I almost feel badly mentioning that \ngreat college--Colgate University 40 to 0.\n  My only concern was if we had another game, I would have felt very \nbadly for whomever we played because they just kept getting better and \nbetter. You can imagine Senator Carper and I and Congressman Castle \nattended the majority of these games as devoted fans.\n  As I earlier said, this marks the university's first division I-AA \ntitle crown, but we earned six other football titles as a division II \nschool, including when I was there playing.\n  The last division II title was in 1979. The reason I mention that is \nit is significant because our current coach, K. C. Keeler, was a \nlinebacker on that national championship team. In his second year at \nthe helm at the university, K. C. Keeler took this team to a national \nchampionship. K. C. is the first to give his predecessor, my old coach, \nTubby Raymond, credit for having recruited pretty good guys to play on \nthat team.\n  Let me conclude by saying I am often asked why I ever thought I \nshould run for President of the United States, as I did, and attempt to \nget the nomination back in the eighties. There was a simple reason. I \nlearned early on, after being a county councilman and then getting \nelected as a Senator, I was given the honor of presenting the \nWashington Touchdown Club's Timmie Award. We used to honor the best \n``small college team in America.'' I had the opportunity of giving that \nto Tubby Raymond.\n  There were people at an old hotel, including Supreme Court Justices \nand others. I never saw my old coach flustered, but as I stood up, \nintroduced by Howard Cosell, to present him with this award, I gave him \nthe award, handed him the trophy, and he turned and said: You know, I \njust want to tell you, Joe Biden was one of the best ball players I \never had play for me. And that was just being a Senator.\n  So I figured if I had gotten elected President, I would have been \nable by another means to be named what I always wanted to be, an All-\nAmerican. And that is the only reason I ever ran for President. I \nwanted to set that record straight.\n  I am one of the best ball players Delaware ever had, which is simply \nnot true. But I can tell you it is the only time my former coach was \never flustered. But this guy, Keeler, knows about my lack of talent and \nabout how to recognize talent, and he produced the best football team \nprobably in the history of the State of Delaware. We are here to \ncongratulate them.\n  I thank my colleagues for allowing us this time.\n  I yield now to my colleague who is an equally avid football fan and a \ngraduate of the University of Delaware.\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, the first time I visited the University \nof Delaware campus was in 1973. My first reaction was: what a beautiful \nplace, and it truly is a gorgeous campus. Later, as I learned more \nabout the university, I learned they were one of the top 25 public \nuniversities in the country academically and have remained that for \nsome time. We are proud of that fact.\n  What I also learned my first year at the University of Delaware in \nthe MBA program, fresh out of the Navy, was\n\n[[Page S2585]]\n\nthey played football at Delaware. I was a Buckeye of Ohio State in 1968 \nwhen we went all the way. I learned they were as rabid about football \nin Delaware as we were in Columbus, OH.\n  During the years that transpired since I moved to Delaware, there was \na time when the Dallas Cowboys rose in standing nationally, and I \nrecall in some circles it was America's team. I was looking through the \nroster of Delaware's team last night to see some of the States our \nplayers came from. While I did not find anybody from Alaska, the State \nfrom which the Presiding Officer comes, I certainly saw a number of \nplayers from Delaware, from New Jersey, a number of players from \nMaryland, a lot of players from Virginia, California, Georgia--quite a \nfew from Georgia--and Pennsylvania. We have players from South \nCarolina, North Carolina, Indiana, Connecticut, Michigan, New York, \nFlorida, Arizona. We even have one, I say to Senator Biden, I don't \nknow if he realizes it, but we even have one player on the roster from \nGermany. That is going the extra mile to get the kind of talent K. C. \nKeeler and his predecessor, Tubby Raymond, wanted to bring to our \ncampus.\n  I have been privileged to enjoy a lot of terrific sports moments in \nmy life. This last year, the University of Delaware football team on \nits way to the national championship provided us with two I will never \nforget.\n  One was a 51 to 45 win over Massachusetts in triple overtime on a \nblustery fall afternoon at the University of Delaware. It was a \nheartstopper. It was an amazing win, topped only by a 40 to 0 victory \nover Colgate on a very cold night in December of last year.\n  I have been to a lot of games in my life. I have never been to a game \nwhere everybody on our side of the field stood up the entire first \nquarter. They never sat down. I have never been to a game in my life \nwhere everybody stood up for the second quarter, and third quarter, and \nthe fourth quarter. We had places to sit, but nobody ever sat down. It \nwas just the most incredible spirit or euphoria I ever witnessed.\n  When the game was over, the players and a lot of fans rushed the \nfield in the presentation of the trophy to Coach Keeler. The fans \ngathered around. People did not want to leave. I remember standing half \nan hour later at one end of the end zone with Congressman Castle \nlooking out over the field and looking at everybody in sheer joy, \nsavoring the moment.\n  Another special moment was when Coach Keeler went into the end zone \nwith Tubby Raymond, his predecessor and coach when Keeler was a \nlinebacker with the national championship team in the late seventies. \nTubby handed it off and Coach Keeler went on to the national \nchampionship.\n  For some of the players who left the field that night, it was the \nlast football game they will ever play. Others will go on to be greats \nin professional football. Some may be lucky to turn up as Rich Gannon \ndid, who ended up being the MVP of the NFL last year, whether they end \nup in pro football or other athletic-related endeavors. Sometimes they \ngo on to do great things with their life, such as Tyrone Jones, who was \na freshman in 1982, one of the years Delaware made it to the finals for \nthe national championship and did not make it by three points. Tyrone \nJones is now New Castle County coordinator. He is in charge of all of \nNew Castle County. Back in 1982, he was a freshman playing for a great \nteam, and in 1983, 1984, 1985, he played free safety for some of \nTubby's teams.\n\n  Tubby Raymond, who is now in the Football Hall of Fame, had 300 \ncareer wins. Ty Jones was on the field for about 20 of those wins. We \nare very proud of him.\n  I want to say to those who might be watching from Delaware or here \nrepresenting Delaware, whatever you do on the field or beyond, there is \ngreatness to be accomplished, and we are proud of Ty and others who \nfollow endeavors off of the gridiron.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, in the year 2000, there were 38 million \nfamilies in this country who owned an individual retirement account or \nparticipated in an employer-sponsored retirement savings plan. Since \nthen, unemployment has climbed to 8.3 million people, with more than \n1.9 million individuals unemployed more than 6 months.\n  Six months without work is a long time, and it is enough time for \npeople to lose their homes, give up their health care, run through \ntheir savings, and ruin their credit for many years to come. I know \nthis because I hear from people in Arkansas who have gone from living \nthe family dream, to living off of their families, and eventually \nliving off of Government help.\n  To add salt to the wound for many unemployed Americans, those \nindividuals who are fortunate enough to have an individual retirement \naccount are penalized a minimum of 10 percent if they withdraw funds \nfrom their account.\n  Recognizing that some significant events might require people to \nwithdraw money from their retirement accounts earlier than expected, \nCongress has on previous occasions provided exceptions to the 10-\npercent early withdrawal penalty; for example, buying their first home \nor maybe even sending their children to college.\n  I am offering a commonsense amendment that could make a real \ndifference for individuals who have invested in their IRA but have \nexhausted all of their unemployment benefits while searching for a job.\n  I am asking Congress to make another exception because our job \ncreation figures continue to disappoint, economic growth continues to \nlinger, and our manufacturing jobs continue to leave the country. I \nthink these are significant events as well.\n  My amendment is a sense of the Senate and allows individuals who have \nexhausted their unemployment benefits a one-time withdrawal of up to \n$15,000 from their IRAs, tax free and without penalty, within 1 year \nafter their unemployment benefits end.\n  In many cases, my amendment would free up enough money for a few \nmonths of rent or mortgage payments, child care expenses, groceries, \nand other living expenses.\n  Regardless of what you believe, regardless of your party affiliation, \nwe cannot dismiss these new numbers by the Bureau of Labor Statistics \nthat indicate the average length of unemployment in this country is at \na 20-year high.\n  We cannot expect Americans to be patient as they watch their bills \npile up, and we cannot tell these families to keep their fingers \ncrossed any longer while we do nothing to help them. After all, this \nmoney in their IRA accounts is their money. Imagine a family whose \nbreadwinner is now on the unemployment rolls, and he or she has this \nretirement nest egg sitting there and they have some real needs in the \nfamily but they cannot touch their own money without penalty or paying \ntaxes on accessing that money.\n  Madam President, I ask my colleagues to express their support \ntomorrow for the individuals who are in a tough position because of \ntough times and allow them to use funds from their own IRAs without \npenalty.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I thank the floor manager. It has been \na long day, and perhaps we have made some progress and the hour is a \nlittle late. I am going to speak just on two amendments of mine that I \nwill offer and which will be voted on tomorrow.\n  I will take the time tonight to speak at some length about these \namendments because our time will be so limited, unfortunately, because \nof the rules under which we are operating.\n  Before I do, let me restate for the record that I intend to vote \nagainst this budget. It is not a budget that will put America on the \nright course. This is a budget that will turn a stream of red ink into \na raging river that will threaten to wash away Social Security, and \nthis is according not to the Democratic spin room or Democratic \noperatives, this is according to Alan Greenspan, who testified before \nthe Budget Committee last week and basically said because of the \nchoices President Bush and the Republican leadership are making in this \nbudget, adjustments will have to be made to Social Security.\n  He could have gone on to say--and I am sure he will in further \nspeeches--that adjustments are going to have to be made to education \nand the Federal contribution to education. We are going to have to make \nadjustments to housing initiatives in this country, and we are going to \nhave to make adjustments to the contributions we make to colleges and \nuniversities because if this budget goes into law, the country will \nbasically be on a course to bankruptcy because the debt is rising so \nhigh.\n  We have been attacked by terrorists. We have a war now that is \ncosting us hundreds of millions of dollars. We have passed a major \neducation initiative that the President himself said he wanted to fund, \nand the economy has, in many instances, tanked, contrary to all of our \nhopes and expectations.\n  Yet the plan is for tax cuts every day, always deeper and greater, \nwhich is threatening to wash away a lot of things that are important to \npeople in this country. One of the things we cannot fix because of this \nblind adherence to tax cuts for people who earn over a million dollars \nis a survivor benefit for our military personnel.\n  There are a lot of issues for which we could fight. I want to show \nthis document. It is from the Military Officers Association: Fighting \nfor Fairness. The public is going to have a hard time believing this, \nso I am going to try to go over it as simply as I can. In 1972, our \nGovernment promised the spouses of people in the military--now, most of \nthe spouses would be women but not all of them would be women. Most are \nwomen. Our Government promised them if they would contribute a certain \namount of money into a special fund, after the member of the service \npassed away, they could provide a nest egg for their spouses. These are \nspouses, and everyone is familiar with this. These women--millions of \nthem--move every 2 years, generally. They move themselves, their \nchildren, and most do it with a smile and joy on their face because \nthey are committed to helping the country, and they are supporting \ntheir husbands who are protecting us every day.\n  We promised to give them what we call a survivor's benefit. But we \nhave failed to live up to that promise. We have, instead, said even \nthough we said we would do that, we decided to save money so we could \ngive money, as the Senator from Oklahoma said, to the millionaires who \nneed tax cuts in this country. We said instead of making the promise to \nthese individuals, we have another priority, and that is to give people \nwho make over a million dollars tax cuts because they need it. But we \ncannot give spouses of the people in the military their full benefit.\n  It gets worse because the document we gave them actually doesn't \nmention the offset. I am going to submit it because I want to make it \nclear that this is the document our military signed, and it will be \nread for the Record. Nowhere in here did it talk about an offset. An \noffset is, when the spouse gets to be 62 years of age, instead of \nreceiving the benefit that her husband put aside specifically for her, \nthinking that\n\n[[Page S2587]]\n\nhe was doing a good thing to help protect her in her old age because \nshe moved every 2 years and she has had to live under tremendous \npressure--when you move every 2 years, I think people would understand \nit would be hard to keep a career going in the right direction and \ncontinue to increase your earnings, if you did want to work outside of \nthe home. Maybe you could manage to get a minimum-wage job or \nsomething, but it would be very hard to develop a career when you have \nto move every 2 years. She did. These women did. Then they signed a \ndocument that said they would receive this benefit, and, lo and behold, \nthey were told after they were in their sixties and their husbands had \ndied, after their husbands served 20 and sometimes 30 years in the \nmilitary protecting us and giving us the advantages, that the thousands \nof dollars they were counting on were not there.\n\n  It gets worse. In addition to not funding this for our military \nfamilies, we do fund, as the Federal Government, if you work for the \nFederal Government in civilian employment and you take out a policy for \nyour spouse, you do not have the same offset. So we have the very \nunfair and terribly unjust situation today where if you are a spouse of \na military person, and you have moved every 2 years, your spouse has \nprotected the country for the last 30 years, and you get to be 62, you \ndo not receive that full benefit because we need to save money to cut \ntaxes for people who make over $1 million. That is the situation.\n  My amendment, which I am going to ask be voted on tomorrow, would fix \nthat situation. I do not think it is going to be adopted, but I am \ngoing to offer it anyway because I want my colleagues on the other side \nto be on the record saying the choice they make is not to fix this \nsituation which will cost us approximately $2 billion because we cannot \nafford it. We can afford $2.6 trillion in tax cuts, but we cannot \nafford $2 billion to help our military families.\n  I am not going to vote that way, but some people will, and they can \nexplain it to the thousands of retirees in their States. I am not sure \nhow.\n  For the record, under the civil service retirement system, the \npercentage of survivor benefits, people receive 55 percent; the Federal \nemployee retirement system receives 50 percent, but not the widows and \nwidowers of people who served in the military. I do not understand it, \nand nobody in Louisiana understands it because we continue to increase \nthe military budget. I know, because I voted for every increase in the \nmilitary budget since I arrived in the Senate 7 years ago. I voted for \nbillions of dollars because I believe in a strong military.\n  I do not know how not living up to your promises to people in uniform \nto help them protect their spouses helps us to strengthen our military. \nIf anybody knows, maybe they can communicate that to me because I do \nnot know.\n  I am hoping when we vote on this amendment tomorrow, perhaps we can \nfind some money in this budget to take care of this situation. I \nunderstand the House has acted. I also understand a bill has been filed \nby the Senator from Maine, a Senator for whom I have a great deal of \nrespect, Ms. Snowe. It is a bipartisan effort. I am hoping maybe we can \nfind some money in this budget to make some adjustments for the \nsurvivors benefit plan.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a letter that was \nrecently printed in the Washington Times that outlines this situation, \nand also the actual document our families signed that leads them to \nbelieve they are going to get this benefit.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Times, Feb. 23, 2004]\n\n                   Survivor Benefit Plan Needs Reform\n\n       Dear Sgt. Shaft: The Fleet Reserve Association (FRA) is \n     urging all 66 members of the House and Senate budget \n     committees to include funding in the 2005 budget resolution \n     for legislation (S. 1916 and H.R. 3673) that eliminates the \n     drastic reduction in Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) annuities \n     that now adversely impacts survivors of military personnel \n     who are 62 and older.\n       The current program provides 55 percent of SBP covered \n     retired pay for younger spouses--however, the amount \n     decreases to 35 percent of retired pay when survivors become \n     eligible for Social Security. Many retirees and their spouses \n     were not fully aware of this reduction when they enrolled in \n     the program in the early 1970s. As a result, many believe \n     they were betrayed by having been asked to sign an \n     irrevocable contract to pay lifetime SBP premiums.\n       Sen. Mary L. Landrieu, Louisiana Democrat, introduced the \n     Military Survivor Benefits Improvement Act of 2003 (S. 1916), \n     which would eliminate the SBP offset over a 10-year period. \n     Companion legislation (H.R. 3673) to do the same was \n     introduced by Rep. Jeff Miller, Florida Republican, in the \n     House.\n       The Fleet Reserve Association, the oldest and largest \n     organization dedicated to enhancing pay and benefits for \n     enlisted members of the U.S. Navy, Marine Corps and Coast \n     Guard, was instrumental in the enactment of the military SBP \n     program in 1972, which was designed to improve the Retired \n     Servicemembers Family Protection Plan. Participants were \n     responsible for paying 60 percent of the costs, while the \n     government was to subsidize the remaining 40 percent.\n       But today's SBP program looks nothing like its FRA \n     predecessor, and its intended value has been greatly \n     diminished by the Social Security offset as well as decreased \n     contributions from the federal government.\n       Today, military retirees pay for more than 80 percent of \n     SBP costs, while the government picks up only about 19 \n     percent of the costs. By way of comparison, the federal \n     government subsidizes its civilian survivor benefit plans--\n     Federal Employees Retirement System and Civil Service \n     Retirement System--at 33 percent and 48 percent, \n     respectively.\n       Probably the greatest disparity between the two plans is \n     beneficiaries in the federal civilian programs do not \n     experience the same offset incurred by military SBP \n     beneficiaries when they reach the age of 62. It is \n     unconscionable that the men and women of our armed forces and \n     their families continue to sacrifice at a time when they are \n     in their greatest need.\n       FRA is grateful to Rep. Miller and Mrs. Landrieu for their \n     leadership in campaigning to restore equity and credibility \n     to this vital program. FRA is again referencing the need for \n     SBP reform in its testimony before Congress this year.\n       We urge those who wish to help reform this unfair and \n     debilitating law to visit the association's Action Center at \n     http://www.fra.org/action/index.html, click on ``Urge Your \n     Elected Official to Support Funding for SBP Reform \n     Legislation'' and send a prewritten e-mail to their \n     congressional representatives.\n           Joe Barnes\n           National Executive Secretary\n           Fleet Reserve Association\n       Dear Joe: I echo your praise and support of S. 1916 and \n     H.R. 3673. I also commend Mrs. Landrieu and Mr. Miller for \n     spearheading this vital legislation.\n\n       Dear Sgt. Shaft: I agree totally that the SBP program is a \n     huge injustice for widows of military retired persons. I had \n     10 years of active duty plus 14 years in the Reserves, \n     retiring as an 0-6. It has been a long time since I have seen \n     a write-up of the actual SBP provisions, so I do not \n     understand how it affects me and my wife. Where can I find a \n     good description?\n       From the synopses I have seen so far, we would have been \n     better off to take the dollars and put them toward an annuity \n     policy instead of wasting them on the SBP program.\n           Harry J.

Shaft: Isn't it funny: If Congress wants a pay \n     raise, it's processed with no problems. For those of us ``who \n     paid the price'' for our country (to keep Congress intact), \n     there's always some delay.\n           Michael G.\n           Virginia\n       Dear Michael: The Defense Finance and Accounting Service \n     (DFAS) has announced that computer reprogramming has \n     progressed faster than expected and they have made concurrent \n     disability payments (CDP) to about 150,000 eligible retirees \n     on Feb. 1. Those whose CDP will be delayed another month or \n     two include those who divide their retired pay with a former \n     spouse, medical disability retirees who will have their \n     offset only partially eliminated by the new law change, and a \n     few other special situations.\n       DFAS officials believe that they will be able to provide \n     payment for all of these retirees no later than the April 1 \n     paycheck.\n\n\n      section vii--information on the survivor benefit plan (SBP)\n\n       Definition of Dependent Child. A dependent child must be \n     unmarried and:\n       a. Be under 18 years of age.\n       b. Be between ages 18 and 22 and pursuing a full-time \n     course of study and/or training in a high school, trade \n     school, technical or vocational institute, junior college, \n     college, university, or comparable recognized educational \n     institution (See item e below.)\n       c. Be a child of your present or of a previous marriage, \n     adopted, or a step, foster, or recognized natural child who \n     has lived with you in a regular parent-child relationship and \n     as indicated in a and b above or d below.\n       d. Be incapable of self-support because of a mental or \n     physical incapacity which existed before the 18th birthday, \n     or was incurred before age 22 while pursuing a full-time \n     course of study of training.

If your child(ren) is (are) defined by item b or d \n     above, an affidavit to that effect signed by the registrar or \n     physician, respectively, must be furnished to Retired Pay \n     Operations, USAFAC.\n       Definition of natural person with insurable interest. Any \n     person who can reasonably expect financial benefit from you \n     while you live may be considered as a natural person with an \n     insurable interest. This person may be any close relative \n     such as a child not dependent upon you for support, or a \n     close business associate. If person named is not more nearly \n     related than cousin, attach a statement of Proof of Financial \n     Benefit.\n\n\n        secion viii--monthly cost and amount of survivor annuity\n\n       Spouse only (no eligible children). Cost of coverage is \n     2\\1/2\\ percent of the first $300, plus 10 percent of any \n     designated retired pay in excess of $300. If coverage is \n     elected for a dependent child acquired subsequent to \n     retirement, cost of coverage will be increased. The increase \n     in cost is effective the first day of the month following \n     eligibility of such child. (See c. below.)\n       Spouse and eligible children. The cost of coverage will be \n     2\\1/2\\ percent of the first $300 of the base amount plus 10 \n     percent of the remainder plus a slight additional charge for \n     children's coverage that will vary depending on your age, \n     your wife's age, and the age of your youngest child. The \n     additional charge should generally be about one-half of one \n     percent of the amount of retired pay designated. (See c \n     below.)\n       If your spouse becomes ineligible through divorce, \n     annulment or death, no cost is due for any month in which \n     there is no beneficiary. If you remarry, the cost will be \n     reinstated the first anniversary of the date of remarriage, \n     unless child is born of that marriage prior to the first \n     anniversary date.\n       Eligible children only (no spouse). The cost of coverage \n     will vary depending on your age and the age of your youngest \n     child but should generally be about 3 percent of the amount \n     of retired pay designated.\n       Cost reduction--children. When all children cease to be \n     eligible for an annuity, the additional cost for child \n     coverage shall stop. The reduction in cost is effective the \n     first day of the month following that in which the last child \n     ceases to be eligible for an annuity.\n       Natural interest person. Cost of coverage is 10 percent of \n     full retired pay, plus an additional 5 percent of full \n     retired pay for each full five years that your age exceeds \n     that of the natural interest person. The total cost may not \n     exceed 40 percent of retired pay.\n       Annuity--Spouse and/or eligible children. Full coverage \n     provides an annuity of 55 percent of retired pay. Reduced \n     coverage provides an annuity of 55 percent of reduced amount \n     elected.\n       Annuity--Natural interest person. The annuity payable is 55 \n     percent of retired pay remaining after cost of coverage has \n     been subtracted.\n       Cost-of-Living Increase (CLI). The cost is subject to \n     change based on CLI's in retired pay. Annuities paid to \n     survivors of deceased members are also CLI adjusted.\n     CONTINUATION OF ITEM 10, SECTION IV.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                      SOCIAL\n                     NAME (LAST, FIRST, MI)                        DATE OF BIRTH   SECURITY NO.

Without it, retirees could not change their previous \n     elections.\n       Under this law you have a choice to either participate or \n     not to participate in the Survivor Benefit Plan. If you \n     choose to participate, you have a further choice as to what \n     type of coverage you desire. Under one option, only a SPOUSE \n     is to receive a survivor benefit annuity, under another \n     option, only a CHILD or CHILDREN are to receive annuity \n     payments, and under a third option a CHILD or CHILDREN plus a \n     SPOUSE are to receive annuity payments.\n       To assist you in making your election whether to \n     participate, data are shown below to permit you to determine \n     your actual participation costs. PLEASE note that the \n     ``COST'' shown below is based on the provision of the law \n     whereby only the SPOUSE is to receive a survivor's annuity \n     and this annuity, equal to 55% of your gross retired pay, is \n     the maximum annuity for a spouse. Costs for providing annuity \n     benefits to children where there is no spouse or for benefits \n     to children in addition to the benefits for a spouse, have \n     not been computed. Costs for any optional provision of the \n     law may be approximated using the formula provided in the \n     Retired Army Bulletin. Actual cost of annuities will be \n     actuarially computed in each case as required.\n       If your retired pay exceeds $300 per month, the cost of \n     Survivor Benefit Plan to you is arrived at by charging 2\\1/\n     2\\% against the first $300 of your retired pay and 10% of any \n     amount over $300. This will provide for a maximum annuity \n     equal to 55% of your gross retired pay. If you wish to \n     provide for a survivor's annuity which is less than the \n     maximum permitted, you may do so. To accomplish this you must \n     specify the amount less than your gross retired pay, but in \n     NO case less than $300, to which the 55% is to be applied to \n     determine the amount of the annuity. In the event your \n     monthly retired pay is $300 or less, the cost of providing \n     your survivor with 55% of your full retired pay (no lesser \n     amount is permitted) is 2\\1/2\\% of your retired pay.\n       If you are currently participating in the Retired \n     Serviceman's Family Protection Plan (RSFPP), the cost of your \n     coverage is shown below for informational purposes. The law \n     gives you three (3) options as a present participant in \n     RSFPP. These options are: (1) continue RSFPP and not join \n     Survivor Benefit Plan, (2) drop RSFPP and join Survivor \n     Benefit Plan, and (3) continue RSFPP and join Survivor \n     Benefit Plan to provide a total survivor annuity not to \n     exceed 100% of your retired pay, calculated at the time of \n     election in the new program. Under this third option you may \n     reduce the amount of coverage under RSFPP as you see fit.\n       If you retired prior to 21 September 1972, you have one \n     calendar year in which to elect to participate in the Plan.\n       If you retired within 180 days after enactment of the \n     Survivor Benefit Plan you have 180 days from your date of \n     retirement as shown below to elect NOT to participate in the \n     PLAN. Unless you specifically elect NOT to participate, you \n     are considered in the PLAN and cost deductions will be made \n     from your retired pay at maximum coverage.\n       Your election form is enclosed You should keep this letter \n     with your copy of the election form on the reverse for your \n     records. Your spouse and/or children, or natural person with \n     an insurable interest (which is explained in the Retired Army \n     Bulletin) should be informed of your election.

Madam President, the second amendment I wish to talk \nabout for a moment and offer tomorrow for a vote is not about the \nmilitary; it is about education. I was in the Chamber earlier today \nspeaking about education. Let me recap.\n  Senator Murray offered an amendment which I was pleased to vote for, \nproud to vote for. Although it only received 48 votes, I think it was \none of the most important amendments we discussed all day. The reason I \nsay that is because one of the major platforms of this administration \nwhen this President took office--I can remember the speeches. I sat in \nthe great room of the House Chamber and listened to the State of the \nUnion speeches. I will paraphrase, but I heard this.\n  I heard the leader of our country say we are not doing enough in \neducation; that our schools were not doing what they should do, and \nthat he had a plan. If we would just stop throwing money at the system, \nif we would start expecting success, not funding failure, if we would \nembrace accountability, if we would make sure all of our teachers were \ncertified, and if we would really work together across party lines and \ncome up with a new plan for public education in our Nation, that is \nwhat we should do.\n  I was convinced, committed, and worked very hard to see that bill \npass, and it passed. That was the No Child Left Behind Act. It was not \na big lift for me for a number of reasons.\n  I am very proud of my State because before we entered into this \nagreement at the Federal level, the State of Louisiana was one of about \nfive States in the Union that was pioneering this exact concept. It \nsaid for 150 years we have just thrown money at the system not really \nrequiring or expecting good results and not really measuring our \ncommitment of dollars based on the results we were getting, and that \ndid not seem to make sense. So we switched our system, holding all \nschools accountable, not just for the averages for the subgroups of \nchildren--African Americans, rural children, poor children--but making \nsure we were not leaving anybody out.\n\n[[Page S2589]]\n\n  We were well on our way. Louisiana was doing great. Then this \nadministration came in and said: Your plan, although you like it and \nthe people of Louisiana like it and you are making progress, I do not \nthink it is strong enough. He, the leadership, pushed this country into \nan even stricter plan. The leadership, the administration, said: If you \ngo there, I will be there. I will help and provide the funding in the \nbudget for No Child Left Behind.\n  One of the reasons I am going to vote against this budget tomorrow is \nbecause that did not come true, because it is short $9 billion. For \nLouisiana, it means about $200 million.\n  I have schools that have been rated as in need of improvement. They \nare trying so hard, and they are doing a beautiful job. But they need \nto hire a few more teachers. This administration said it would be there \nto help hire the teachers. The President said that, but it is not in \nhis budget, and it is not in the budget in the chairman's mark to help \nthem.\n  Unfortunately, one of the small items that is in the budget which \nreally pours salt on the wound is, while we do not have the $9 billion \nfor No Child Left Behind, I want to share with everyone what is in the \nbudget, which is very hard to read. What is in the budget is $50 \nmillion to send kids from public schools to private schools, basically. \nIt reserves $50 million for school choice initiatives that move \nchildren from public schools to private schools.\n  Now we have the situation where we are not going to fund taking \nchildren from lower performing schools to move them into higher \nperforming public schools, but we are going to specifically provide \nadditional money to move them into private schools.\n  For the record, in Chicago, under the President's plan, 125,000 \nstudents were eligible for transfer, meaning that 125,000 students \nfound themselves in schools that did not make the mark.\n  They requested a transfer to a higher performing public school, which \nis one of the promises of No Child Left Behind, but only 3,000 were \ntransferred. Why? Because there is no space. Why? Because they do not \nhave the money to hire additional teachers. Why? Because the \nPresident's budget specifically prohibits money from being used for \nschool construction, because the Republican leadership, led by \nPresident Bush, does not want money spent on school construction.\n  I do not know how children are moved from a lower performing school \nto a higher performing school if the higher performing school is filled \nunless classrooms are added, expanded, or teachers are added. Because \nhe flat-funded the teacher section and prohibits money from being used \nto build additional schools, I am not quite sure how our \nsuperintendents, Democrats or Republicans, are going to handle it, but \nthey have a real challenge before them.\n  In Los Angeles, we have 230,000 children who are eligible for \ntransfer. I do not think anybody in the Chamber could guess how many \nactually were transferred. One hundred students. Two hundred thirty \nthousand children are eligible, and 100 were transferred.\n  I learned today, and I am going to submit for the Record, if I can \nverify it--and if not, I will remove this from the Record--there has \nnot been a new school built in L.A. in the last 20 years. That may not \nbe correct, but I want to say it tonight. If it is not, I will remove \nit from the Record. L.A. is growing so fast, and these children have no \nplace to go, and this budget does not help them get anywhere. It says \ninstead of helping children go to new public schools, we are going to \nsend them to private schools.\n  Of course, there are no spaces in the private schools, either, so I \nam not sure where we are going to send them.\n  In Baltimore, 30,000 children--that is this year--last year were \neligible for transfer. Only 194 were transferred. In New Orleans, in my \nhome city, 35,000 children were in failing schools. Only 400 were \ntransferred. The rest were denied because of lack of space in higher \nperforming schools.\n  My amendment is going to remove the $50 million, and say no money can \nbe spent in this budget sending children to private schools until we \nprovide options for them to go to public schools. Many of these \nfamilies would choose public schools, but according to this budget they \ncannot go because we will not help them add teachers, and they are \nstrictly prohibited from using the money for school construction in \nthis budget.\n  Those are the two amendments: One to help spouses in the military. I \nthink we can find a few million dollars to help them and I am hoping to \ntake this out of the budget so we can keep our priorities straight, \nwhich is helping all schools with the best we can, but living up to our \npromises of No Child Left Behind first.\n  When we have funded that effort, which is not just any other \nGovernment program--I know we do not fund every Government program at \nthe authorized levels, but this is different. This was a special \npromise made. This was the foundation of a new beginning for our public \nschools. This was a promise that was made to the people of our country, \nand it is a promise that is not fulfilled in this budget, which is why, \nagain, I will vote against it, and I will be pleased to offer these \namendments in the morning.\n  I yield back my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/10/senate-section/article/S2589-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2589]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
