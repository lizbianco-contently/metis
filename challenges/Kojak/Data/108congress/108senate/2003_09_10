Mr. President, we are set to proceed with a series of \nstacked votes at 9:45 a.m. There are a fair number of amendments which \nhave yet to\n\n[[Page S11264]]\n\nbe offered. The distinguished ranking member and I are prepared to work \nthrough those amendments expeditiously. It may be possible to \naccommodate some of the Members in their requests.\n  The majority leader has again announced that upon completion of this \nbill there will be no votes on Thursday or Friday, although the Senate \nwill be in session. When that word travels throughout the membership, \nthere is more incentive to complete this bill at an early time. \nYesterday we did have a productive day, starting at 5:15 p.m. We had \nfour rollcall votes. We debated six amendments on into the evening.\n  As I survey the sheet, if we have cooperation on all sides, it is \npossible to move through this bill in an expeditious way and perhaps \nfinish this bill today sooner rather than later.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I understand we are going to start the \nvote at 9:45 a.m.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, first, I thank the leadership on the other \nside. I thank my colleague and the chairman of the appropriations \nsubcommittee, Senator Specter, for working out this arrangement. It is \none that reasonable minds and reasonable cool heads have agreed now we \nare going to proceed ahead on a series of votes this morning.\n  I know there are some other amendments today. I see no reason why we \ncan't wrap up this bill this evening sometime, hopefully at a decent \nhour anyway. I know there are a lot of other important amendments. I \nwish to take a little bit of time to speak about the first amendment \nthat we will be voting on at 9:45.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Are we going to divide the time between proponents and \nopponents of the amendment between now and 9:45? I understand there is \nno time agreement. I would like to have 2 minutes in opposition to the \namendment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I inquire of the Chair.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is no previous order concerning \ndivision of time. The time set for the vote is 9:45.\n  Mr. HARKIN. But there is no time set for dividing the time.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is no agreement on dividing the \ntime.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nintervening time be equally divided between both sides--whatever time \nthere is--to make a presentation.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. There are 6 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. HARKIN. That sounds fair.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Iowa.\n\n\n                             Amendment 1580\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Thank you, Mr. President. The first vote will be on \novertime. I think it has been thoroughly debated. I think Senators know \nwhat we are voting on in this amendment. I wish to make a few comments \nto bring us up to the point of voting on this amendment.\n  Again, I do not see this in any way as any kind of a partisan vote. \nIt should not be. This affects workers no matter whether they are \nRepublicans, Democrats, Independents, or whatever. It does not make any \ndifference. This crosses all party lines.\n  What has happened, through the Department of Labor, is they came out \nwith these proposed changes in overtime rules and regulations. No \nhearings were held, and now they say they do not have to have hearings. \nThe law does not mandate that they have to have hearings, but one would \nthink on a major issue such as this they would have gone out to the \npublic and they would have worked with Congress to reach some \nreasonable agreement on modifying and updating Fair Labor Standards Act \nregulations. But, no, they came out with these changes in a very \nheavyhanded manner.\n  If one reads the proposed rules and regulations, they really do wipe \naway the overtime pay protections for I don't know--the figures are all \nover--8 million, 10 million, 6 million. I don't know what the proper \nnumber is, but I can tell you it wipes out overtime pay protection for \nmillions of Americans who have it right now.\n  My amendment basically says no money can be expended to further \npromulgate, publish, or enact these rules and regulations.\n  That does not mean the Department of Labor cannot come back at some \npoint and say we need to modify these. Maybe we need to throw out some \nold terms.\n  As I pointed out, the Fair Labor Standards Act has been modified a \ndozen times since 1938, but it has always been done sort of in \nconsultation with Congress, in an open fashion. That is the way it \nought to be done again, especially with something so sensitive as \novertime pay.\n  So this is our vote in which we can basically say no, we are not \ngoing to move ahead with these; we are going to go back to the drawing \nboard. If they want to come up to the Congress, to the appropriate \nauthorizing committees in the House and the Senate, and try to work \nsomething out, that is fine and we can do that.\n  In closing, last week the Senate unanimously passed this resolution \nby Senator Hatch, expressing the sense of the Senate that October would \nbe National Work and Family Month. The resolution expressed the sense \nof the Senate that reducing the conflict between work and family life \nshould be a national priority. We passed this last Friday unanimously. \nAre we today going to vote to say we do not care about what we said; \nwhat we are going to do is allow these rules and regulations to go into \neffect which will take away the overtime pay protection for millions of \nAmericans?\n  Let's back up what we said last Friday with our votes this morning.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has consumed his time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak in \nsupport of the Harkin amendment regarding the Bush administration's \nproposal to make regulatory changes to the Fair Labor Standards Act, \nFLSA, of 1938. The Bush administration's assault on middle-income \nwhite- and blue-collar workers continues with this latest proposal by \nthe Department of Labor, DOL. Under current law, the FLSA requires \nemployers to pay time and a half for overtime work except for some \nnarrow exemptions. Introduced this Spring with little public notice, \nthe DOL has proposed regulations that would disqualify potentially \nmillions of workers from the overtime protections afforded them under \nthe FLSA. Regulations proposed by the DOL on March 31 of this year \nwould make it easier for employers to reclassify their workers as \n``executive,'' ``administrative'' or ``professional'' employees who are \nnot entitled to the overtime protections of the FLSA. According to the \nEconomic Policy Institute, more than 8 million workers could be \nnegatively affected by the Bush administration regulatory changes. This \nis a frontal assault on the 40-hour work week.\n  The Harkin amendment would prevent the DOL from issuing any \nregulation that disqualifies currently covered workers from the \novertime protections of the FLSA. The amendment would not prevent DOL \nfrom making changes to overtime regulations that would benefit low-\nincome workers. There is simply no justification for stripping any \nworkers of their overtime rights and thus their statutory right to time \nand a half. And the workers who would still be protected by the FLSA \nwould also receive a pay cut because employers would naturally shift \novertime assignments to the millions of workers no longer entitled to \novertime pay. In 2000, overtime pay accounted for about 25 percent of \nthe income of workers who worked overtime or about $161 a week. The \nPresident's much-touted tax cut would give workers earning less than \n$62,500 a tax cut of a $1.68 per week. This administration's overtime \nproposal is just not worker or family friendly. It will result in \nworkers working more hours without overtime pay, undermining the 40-\nhour work week. The DOL proposed regulations would deny overtime \nprotections not only to white-collar office workers, but also to many \nmanual and other union workers. Union workers would be forced to \nnegotiate for overtime protections that are now guaranteed by the FLSA. \nThe overtime exceptions would affect all\n\n[[Page S11265]]\n\nworkers earning more than $65,000 as well as workers with certain \nspecialized training such as policemen, firefighters, paramedics, EMTs, \nas well as other white-collar professionals such as secretaries, \nbookkeepers, and paralegals.\n  Every facet of American industry will be affected by the proposed DOL \nregulations. For example, assembly line and production workers at auto \nmanufacturing plants could lose overtime protection if they ``employ a \nhigh-level of skill or training.'' Furthermore, factory workers making \nup to $65,000 could lose overtime protection if they perform some \nnonmanual office work and have at least one job duty that can be \ncharacterized as ``executive,'' ``administrative'' or ``professional.'' \nNonmanual office work seems to be a broad term that could encompass \nmany fairly routine workplace activities. Even a worker who at the end \nof the day is required to document his or her workplace activities \nmight be swept in to the administrative exemption. Surely this was not \nthe intent of the FLSA.\n  At a time when we are asking more and more of our Nation's first \nresponders, the administration wants to eliminate their overtime pay. A \ngood example are the police officers responsible for the security of \nthe Capitol Complex. Many of these officers have consistently worked in \nexcess of 40 hours ever since September 11, 2001. Many of these \nofficers have spent long periods of time away from their family and \nfriends with their only consolation being overtime pay. How can \nPresident Bush and Secretary Chao possibly tell law enforcement \nofficers across this Nation that they no longer deserve to be paid \novertime for their work?\n  Mr. President, we must do what is equitable for American workers. \nMillions of workers depend on overtime pay to make ends meet. If the \nadministration really wants to help low-income workers, they will \nsupport an increase in the Federal minimum wage to $6.65 an hour which \nwould benefit far more than the 1.3 million low-income workers which \nDOL estimates will benefit from proposed changes. A vote for the Harkin \namendment is a vote for working families across America. I hope it will \nreceive a resounding ``yes'' vote.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Harkin \namendment to the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education \nappropriations bill for fiscal year 2004.\n  I proudly support this amendment because it would prevent the \nadministration from implementing any regulation that would take away \nthe overtime pay rights of American workers.\n  The Bush administration's hostility to this Nation's hard-working men \nand women is shocking and frankly disappointing.\n  We all know this administration's performance on job growth: since \nPresident Bush assumed office, he has pushed for three separate tax \ncuts for the wealthy, yet he has not created a single net job.\n  Rather, the policies of President Bush have produced a loss of 3.1 \nmillion private sector jobs. The number of unemployed Americans has \nrisen from 6 million to over 9 million. Just last month, the Nation's \npayroll lost 93,000 jobs.\n  Instead of working to put Americans back to work, the administration \nhas decided to ``modernize'' workplace regulations by eliminating \novertime pay for million of workers.\n  The Economic Policy Institute concludes that more than 8 million \nworkers would lose overtime protection. Even the conservative \nEmployment Policy Foundation estimates that 1.16 million workers would \nlose their overtime pay.\n  The administration, however, claims that only 644,000 workers would \nbe negatively affected by its proposal.\n  Regardless of the losses estimated, the proposed regulation would \ndisqualify more workers from overtime protection, and there is simply \nno justification for stripping any workers of their overtime rights.\n  Just yesterday, nursing home workers from my home state came to my \noffice and told me that they get paid between $7 and $10 per hour and \nthat they rely on overtime pay as an essential supplemental to their \nlow hourly pay.\n  The administration opposes an increase in the minimum wage which \nwould help millions of American workers, but it supports a proposal \nthat would decrease the take-home pay of millions of American workers.\n  Once again this administration has misguided priorities. We should be \ndoing all we can to improve the working conditions and the quality of \nlife of the American worker, not make it worse.\n  The 40-hour workweek was created in the Fair Labor Standard Act in \n1938. We enacted this legislation because workers were being abused and \nnot properly compensated.\n  The FLSA became the bedrock of worker- and family-friendly \nlegislation because we recognized that after 40-hours of work, 8-hours \na day for 5 days, an employee should be paid time and a half for work \nperformed beyond 40 hours.\n  Today, the workers protected by the 40-hour workweek requirement are \nthe Nation's first responders and first-preventers like police officer, \nnurses, and firefighters. Other protected workers include the millions \nof administrative, technical, manufacturing, and restaurant workers who \nare struggling to make ends meet.\n  We should protect the American workers. And, I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the Harkin amendment.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I strongly support the Harkin amendment \nto preserve overtime pay protections for millions of hard-working \nAmericans. The American work ethic, along with great skill and \ningenuity, has made the United States an economic world power. \nAmericans already log more hours on the job than workers in most other \ndeveloped countries around the world and I believe that those who have \nlong driven the American economy should be fairly compensated for their \nwork. However, the Bush administration has proposed new regulations \nthat would amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 and undermine \ncurrent law governing overtime pay.\n  The proposed Department of Labor regulations would raise the salary \nlevel under which workers are eligible for overtime pay from $8,060 per \nyear to $22,100 per year. Raising this income threshold is an \ninadequate adjustment, but it is a step in the right direction. Due to \nthe rising expenses facing working families, I recognize the need to \nmake more low-income workers eligible for overtime pay. The pending \namendment does not preclude the Department of Labor from issuing rules \nthat make such changes. Instead, it simply prohibits the Department of \nLabor from taking away overtime protections for those who are currently \neligible under the Fair Labor Standards Act.\n  Under the Department of Labor's proposal virtually all employees who \nearn $65,000 or more per year would be denied overtime pay protection \ncurrently afforded under the Fair Labor Standards Act. Additionally, it \nwould allow employers to reassign middle-income workers, earning \nbetween $22,100 and $65,000, to managerial roles, thereby depriving \nthem of overtime pay rights. The Harkin amendment would block this \nreclassification.\n  Our economy is facing serious difficulties. What we need is \nresponsible economic policy that puts our economy back on track. \nInstead, this administration has proposed massive tax cuts to benefit \nthe wealthiest among us, presided over the largest job loss in our \nNation's history, erased a large Federal surplus that it inherited, and \ncreated a large and growing Federal deficit. Now the administration \nproposes to amend a law that has protected American workers for over 60 \nyears by taking away the overtime pay that many working families depend \nupon to make ends meet.\n  The Department of Labor claims its proposal is necessary to \n``clarify'' and ``update'' overtime rules for the 21st century economy. \nHowever, consider some examples of the occupations currently eligible \nfor overtime pay that may be in jeopardy should the Department of Labor \ngo forward with this proposal: firefighters, law enforcement officers, \nsocial caseworkers, medical assistants, and nurses. These workers are \nperforming vital functions in our society and should be compensated for \nthe long hours they put in to do their jobs.\n  The American people have spoken on this issue. The Department of \nLabor has been flooded by public comments\n\n[[Page S11266]]\n\nthat run overwhelmingly against the implementation of its proposal. The \nAmerican people are right. The number of individuals eligible for \novertime should be increased, not decreased. A responsible economic \nplan would put more disposable income into the hands of working \nAmericans, not take it away.\n  I find the Department of Labor's proposal unwise and unfair, but very \nmuch in keeping with this administration's failed economic policies \nthat seek to leave no millionaire behind while increasing the financial \nburden on average Americans. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to support \nthe Harkin amendment.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Harkin \namendment related to proposed administration changes to overtime \nregulations, and I am pleased to be a co-sponsor.\n  The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 established that--with only a \nfew specific exceptions--American workers were entitled to overtime \npay, meaning time and a half wages, for every hour worked beyond the \naccepted 40-hour work week. The Fair Labor Standards Act was not passed \nout of context. The legislation derived from the labor abuses that \noccurred in the early 1900s. Furthermore, it was signed into law \nbecause political and labor leaders at that time agreed that workers \nshould not be pushed beyond their breaking point. By making every hour \nbeyond 40 more expensive, the legislation discouraged employers from \nassigning longer hours and rewarded employees for sacrificing their \npersonal or family time for their company. Workers could still work \nlonger hours if they chose to do so, or if they needed additional \nincome--many do so today--but they could not be required to do so by \ntheir employers, and they could not be required to do so at the same \nwage level they earned during their 40-hour work week.\n  I think this was a perfectly reasonable bargain to have made then, \nand I think it is a perfectly reasonable bargain now. It is a form of \nsocial contract--one of many made at the time that have extended to the \npresent because they make good rational sense. And I am strongly of the \nview that it should not be broken at this time.\n  The Bush administration has recently proposed substantial regulatory \nchanges that dramatically alter this social contract, and the \nunderlying principles that form its foundation. Under the guise of \n``flexibility'' for employees, it has decided to change the categories \nthat will classify a worker as eligible for overtime, and in doing so, \nwill vastly increase the number of employees that are exempt from \novertime pay. The Department of Labor has estimated that the proposed \nchanges will affect only 644,000 workers. But the Economic Policy \nInstitute has concluded that the numbers are significantly \nmiscalculated and the correct figure is closer to 8 million. This \nincludes everyone from police officers, no firefighters, to registered \nnurses, to medical technicians, to floor supervisors in service \nindustries, to paralegals, to journalists--any number of individuals \nthat currently earn more than $22,100 per year.\n  Worse, many of these individuals are currently in professions that \nare essential to national security or difficult to fill. In my State of \nNew Mexico, for example, the proposed regulations would have very \nprofound effects. According to an analysis undertaken by the New Mexico \nDepartment of Labor, over 37,000 workers will lost overtime benefits as \na result of the proposed rule change. Many of these workers are in \nprofessions that we need in the State and we may lost if salaries are \ndecreased--specialty fields like teachers, physical therapists, health \ncare technicians, first responders, and so on. For the life of me I \ndon't see why the Bush administration would be providing disincentives \nfor people to work in fields where we need them the most. Why are we \ntelling teachers, or nurses, or firefighters that we don't value the \nextra time you put in on the job? In my State these folks are \nfrequently living on a shoestring as it is. How can the Bush \nadministration justify a policy that takes money away from them?\n  I have three specific problems with the proposed overtime \nregulations. First, as I have mentioned previously, it pulls back from \nthe social contract made with American workers in the past. I don't \nunderstand what has changed over the last few years to require that \novertime rules be altered, and I don't believe it is time to alter an \nagreement that at its core is designed to allow Americans to be \nrewarded for hard work and spend more time with their families.\n  Second, I think it's the wrong time for change. We have now some of \nthe worst economic conditions that we have seen in years in this \ncountry. Levels of unemployment continue to climb, so much so that many \nworkers have simply given up looking for work. Why are we telling those \nwho have work at this time that they should get less for what they do? \nWhy are we telling these folks they have to take a pay cut? Why are we \ntaking money out of the pockets of these folks, money that these days \ngo to make ends meet, but can also go for mortgages, education, and \nsavings accounts?\n  Third, given the current record of the Bush administration on key \nlabor issues--be it outsourcing, minimum wage, FMLA, workplace \nprotections, or anything else--I am not convinced that it is time to \ngive it ``flexibility'' to apply regulations of any type that will \naffect American workers. From what I have seen so far, I think the \nadministration has taken a very clear stance against the low- and \nmiddle-income workers that form the very heart and soul of this \ncountry, and I think it is time that we push back on these policies.\n  I think it is essential that we send an unequivocal message to the \nBush administration that we will not allow changes on the overtime \nregulations to occur. I believe it is bad policy that will hurt working \nAmericans at a time when they need our support.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to encourage my Senate \ncolleagues to support the Department of Labor's proposed changes to our \nnation's overtime regulations. The amendment being offered by my friend \nSenator Harkin to the 2004 Labor, Health and Human Services, and \nEducation appropriations bill would prohibit spending to implement the \nDepartment of Labor's proposed regulations and, thereby, cripple the \nDepartment in making these important changes. This is not a wise course \nof action and I wish to voice my support today for the Department's \nproposed regulations changes.\n  Before discussing the proposed regulations, I would like to take a \nmoment to address current overtime rules. As you may know, there have \nbeen very few changes to the Fair Labor Standards Act's, FLSA, overtime \nprovisions since the early 1970s.\n  Under these outdated rules, most workers are only guaranteed time-\nand-a-half overtime pay if they earn less than $155 per week. If they \nearn more than $155 per week, then employers have to use a number of \ncomplicated and confusing tests to decide if a particular worker's job \nis ``executive, administrative, or professional,'' and must also use \ncomplicated tests to determine if the worker's pay qualifies as a \n``salary'' rather than an hourly wage.\n  Thus, if a job pays over $155 per week--$170 per week for \n``professionals''--and the job is executive, administrative or \nprofessional, and the worker's pay fits the official definition of a \n``salary,'' then that particular worker is not eligible for overtime. \nYou can imagine the complexity and confusion that businesses have to \ndeal with when they try to determine which workers have to be paid \novertime and which do not.\n  The current rules mean that a restaurant manager or a factory shift \nsupervisor who is paid a salary of $300 per week would be ineligible \nfor overtime, since these kinds of work are generally considered \nexecutive or administrative.\n  I want to discuss the proposed rules in some detail, as I believe \nthere is a great deal of misunderstanding about what they would do and \nwhy they are necessary. The Department of Labor's proposed regulations \nwould raise the $155 per week test to $425 per week. That means that, \nas a general rule, anyone earning less than $425 per week would \nautomatically be guaranteed to be eligible for overtime pay, regardless \nof what kind of work they do.\n  Therefore, the Department of Labor's proposed rules will guarantee \novertime pay to both the restaurant manager and the shift supervisor I \nmentioned above. The proposed regulations will be\n\n[[Page S11267]]\n\na boon to lower-income salaried workers. The Department of Labor \nestimates that its proposed rules will make 1.2 million more lower-\nincome workers eligible for overtime pay. They also estimate that 20 \npercent of salaried employees earn $425 per week or less, roughly \n$21,000 per year.\n  The rules will also modernize the definition of ``executive, \nadministrative, or professional'' work to reflect better the realities \nof today's workforce and to reduce the incomprehensible regulatory \ndefinitions that businesses have had to interpret for the last 20 \nyears. That means that workers who earn more than $425 per week will \nfind it easier to determine whether or not they qualify for overtime \npay, and it will reduce the number of lawsuits over the ``gray areas'' \nin current overtime regulations.\n  Further, the Department of Labor also proposes to allow salaried \nemployees' pay to be docked for full-day absences taken for \ndisciplinary reasons, such as sexual harassment or workplace violence. \nCurrently, only hourly workers' wages are subject to such discipline-\nrelated pay deductions.\n  And finally, the proposed rules state that workers who earn more than \n$65,000 per year will be ineligible for overtime pay if their job has \nat least some duties that are ``executive, administrative, or \nprofessional.'' Therefore, employers who have these kinds of highly \ncompensated workers will find it easier to make them ineligible for \novertime. The Department of Labor chose the $65,000 threshold because \nroughly 20 percent of salaried workers earn $65,000 or more per year. \nThe Department chose to focus its energies on strengthening access to \novertime for the most vulnerable workers, a group that is unlikely to \ninclude many workers whose salaries are in the top 20 percent.\n  I believe that the current overtime regulations are confusing and \noutdated. They have created a maze of uncertainty for business owners, \nwho can be fined up to 3 years of back wages if they misinterpret the \novertime eligibility rules. The Department of Labor's proposed rules \nwill make over a million more lower-income workers eligible for \novertime while also creating clearer overtime eligibility rules for all \nbusinesses to follow. The Department of Labor's rules would guarantee \novertime pay to the bottom 20 percent of salaried workers--some of the \nmost economically vulnerable people in our society--while at the same \ntime giving employers more freedom over how they compensate the top 20 \npercent of salaried workers.\n  These rules are part of this administration's broader agenda for \nlong-lasting, long-term wage growth. These clearer, simpler regulations \nwill increase the efficiency and productivity of American businesses. \nAnd since higher productivity is the key to higher wages, I expect \nthese regulations to help increase the typical American's standard of \nliving.\n  I have received numerous letters from individuals and industry who \nsupport these regulatory efforts by the Department of Labor. I believe \nthe Department has done an excellent job of researching the overtime \nissue and preparing regulations that meet the needs of American \nworkers. I encourage all of my Senate colleagues to support these \nregulations and vote against any amendments that would weaken or impede \nthese much-needed overtime regulation updates.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Harkin \namendment, which would prevent the Department of Labor from \nimplementing its regulation that would deny overtime pay to 8 million \nAmericans, including 450,000 New Yorkers. I am proud to be a co-sponsor \nof this amendment and hope that my colleagues will join me in \nsupporting it with their vote this afternoon.\n  Many of us celebrated Labor Day with picnics, parades, and fanfare, \nbut for too many American workers, there was not much to celebrate at \nall. Close to 10 million Americans are about to lose overtime \nprotection because this administration has decided to do the bidding of \nits corporate donors instead of protecting the rights of overworked and \nunderpaid Americans.\n  The regulation being proposed by the Department of Labor unilaterally \nremoves entire classes of workers from overtime eligibility. \nParalegals, engineers, social workers--today rely on overtime. Tomorrow \nthese individuals will be forced to work longer hours for less pay.\n  An let's not forget our police officers, firefighters, and nurses--\nindividuals who regularly work overtime because they are on the front \nlines of our homeland defense. Does anyone imagine that these dedicated \nindividuals will stop working overtime after this regulation goes into \neffect?\n  I can assure you that the New Yorkers who tell me how this will \naffect them do not think so. They know that when duty calls, they will \nrespond. They simply will not be compensated for their effort.\n  A nurse from Lancaster, NY, wrote to me recently to say, ``I assure \nyou that as a Health Care Professional I work many exhausting though \nrewarding hours in my position. However, I feel strongly that being \nforced to work overtime without appropriate compensation is an insult. \nAs a dedicated health professional, I find it impossible to leave my \npatients untended.''\n  If the administration wants to help working families as they say they \ndo they can fight to expand access to overtime, to raise the minimum \nwage, and to ensure that every working American can take a sick day to \nrecover from the common cold without fearing for their jobs.\n  Instead, this regulation would make unpaid overtime a household word \nand make it easier for bad-faith employers to coerce other workers into \naccepting time off instead of overtime pay.\n  I do not think the administration is unaware of the impact of what \nthey are proposing. If they were, they would not have proposed this \noverhaul of the Fair Labor Standards Act under the cloak of secrecy, \nwithout a single Congressional hearing, without a single public \nhearing.\n  As many of my colleagues know, when the Clinton administration tried \nto issue ergonomics regulations, Republicans in Congress attacked the \nLabor Department for ``rushing to judgment'' because it held ``only'' \n27 days of public hearings. Twenty-seven days.\n  And from this administration, not even one.\n  Those who support the administration's regulation argue that \nDemocrats are overstating our case. They claim that the proposed \nregulation will not have anywhere near the impact that independent \nexperts say it will.\n  But for the sake of argument, let's assume the Department of Labor's \nimpact analysis is absolutely accurate. The administration's own \nanalysis reveals that 644,000 workers will lose overtime pay. But that \nis only the number of workers currently earning overtime pay who will \nlose eligibility. For each worker earning overtime pay, there are \nanother four or five who are protected by the overtime provisions of \nthe Fair Labor Standards Act but do not currently work more than 40 \nhours a week. All of them--between 3.2 million and 3.8 million by the \nDepartment of Labor's own estimates--will lose their overtime \nprotection under the proposed rule. Their employers will require many \nof them to work longer hours because they will have no incentive not \nto. It won't cost them a dime, but it will cost our firefighters, our \npolice officers, our nurses, and so many others in time away from their \nfamilies and money out of their pocket.\n  The Department of Labor's analysis goes on to state that the changes \nin the education test alone will result in 44 percent of the ``learned \nprofessionals'' losing their right to overtime pay. That is 44 percent \nof those working in the fields of chemistry, biology, nursing, \nengineering, accounting, and more. That is 440,000 cooks who would lose \ntheir right to overtime pay.\n  That analysis assumes, and I quote, ``that six years of work \nexperience might be considered equivalent to a bachelor's degree''--\neven without a day of higher education. But this assumption is not \ngrounded in the rule. In fact, the Department of Labor's rule requires \nno minimum education standard. If employers decide that their employees \nhave the same skills as employees with college degrees, employers may \nexempt those employees from overtime.\n  So a cook from Buffalo who has never attended a day of college can be \ndeemed an exempt professional and denied overtime.\n\n[[Page S11268]]\n\n  The administration is taking away the bread and butter earnings \nAmerican families count on, and leaving them with crumbs.\n  Republicans in my State have crossed party lines to block this \nregulation--and I applaud them for doing so. They know how many New \nYorkers rely on overtime pay--not as a luxury, as a necessity.\n  I recently received a note from John, New York City police officer, \nwho wrote to me to say ``police officers like myself are forced to do \novertime whether we like or not because we need the money to stay ahead \nof our bills.'' John is not alone. Overtime compensation accounts for \n25 percent of the total compensation of all workers who receive \novertime pay.\n  This issue is not trivial. At its very core, this issue is about our \nAmerican values of work and family. Workers stripped of their overtime \nprotection would end up working longer hours for less pay. That \ntranslates into less time with their children, less time with their \nparents, their spouses, less time to volunteer and contribute to the \nfabric of our community. More work hours, for less pay, and less family \ntime--that is not the American way.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the Harkin amendment.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today the Senate will be voting on an \namendment that is of vital importance to the working people of \nCalifornia and indeed the Nation.\n  Earlier this year the White House proposed redefining the job \ndescriptions of millions of workers and thus eliminate their right to \novertime pay. Left alone, these rules will go into effect early next \nyear.\n  The Bush administration's proposal could wipe out overtime pay \nprotections and increase work hours for at least 8 million workers. \nLosing overtime pay protections would also result in huge pay cuts for \nmany workers.\n  For more than 65 years we have maintained an appropriate balance \nbetween family life and work life by forcing employers to pay certain \nworkers time and a half when those workers were required to work more \nthan 40 hours in a single week.\n  Thanks to Franklin Delano Roosevelt, this requirement has protected \nthe 40-hour workweek which has been a trademark of our economy for more \nthan six decades. And, as a result, our Nation's workers now have \ngreater dignity, better health, and a more appropriate balance between \nwork and family.\n  This is an issue of fairness. Our workers are more productive than \never and yet the Bush administration believes it is necessary to \npenalize those very individuals who have literally built this Nation.\n  The men and women who will be most hurt by the President's decision \nwill be the hourly workers who maintain our streets, ring up our \ngroceries, and respond to our calls to 911. Those hurt most will be \ndisproportionately women and minority. They will be mostly middle and \nlower income. They will be struggling to make ends meet and they will \nbe worrying about paying the mortgage. They are, in fact, our neighbors \nand friends.\n  Given the high unemployment rate and economic uncertainty that is \nstill smoldering in our economy, this is not the time to be making it \nharder for our hardest workers. Rather, it is a time when we should be \nhelping all workers achieve fairness in the workplace.\n  Fairness in the workplace is good for business. It is well known that \nby requiring companies to respect the 40-hour workweek, we encourage \nbusinesses to hire additional workers. With unemployment above 6 \npercent, we should continue to encourage companies to maximize \nemployment while respecting the workforce they have.\n  I support Senator Harkin's amendment to stop the Department of Labor \nfrom issuing any regulation that disqualifies workers from the overtime \nprotections of the Fair Labor Standards Act.\n  I think the amendment is fair and just.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I oppose President Bush's plan to deny overtime pay to \nmillions of workers. I am proud to cosponsor Senator Harkin's amendment \nto protect overtime pay for 8 million American workers. Millions of \nAmericans depend on overtime pay to make ends meet and pay their \nhousing, food, and health care bills. Yet the Bush administration wants \nto strip overtime protections for these hard-working men and women. I \nthought in this country, the best social program was a job. I thought \nin this country, we reward those who practice self-help.\n  Eight million workers would lose overtime protection under the new \nBush proposal. Who are these workers? They are nurses, firefighters, \npolicemen, secretaries, and social workers. These men and women work \nhard to serve our communities. They protect us, and they help us when \nwe are in need. They deserve extra pay for their extra efforts.\n  If we do not stop the Bush proposal, workers will have to work long \nhours for less money because they will no longer be eligible for \novertime pay. They might have to find a second job, because they will \nnot be able to count on overtime pay to make ends meet. They will spend \nless time with their families but they will not get compensated. I \nthink that is outrageous.\n  America is facing a crisis in nursing. In Maryland hospitals, 12.6 \npercent of nursing jobs are vacant. They desperately need over 2,000 \nnurses. Nationwide, we will need about 2.8 million registered nurses by \nthe year 2020, but only about 2 million will be available. Nurses work \nan average of 8.5 weeks of overtime each year, and 87 percent of \nMaryland nurses work overtime just to make up for the shortage. If the \nBush proposal becomes law, nurses will have to work these same hours \nfor no extra pay. Hospitals will have to get by without enough nurses \nto take care of patients. Lack of overtime pay will discourage young \nnurses from entering the profession and experienced nurses from \nstaying. I worked hard to pass legislation to help eliminate the \nnursing shortage. Changing the overtime rules would be a huge step \nbackwards.\n  The Bush plan would also deny overtime pay for our first responders: \nour firefighters, policemen, and EMTs. Maryland has about 2,000 \nprofessional firefighters and 7,500 police. These men and women put \ntheir lives on the line to keep us safe no matter what time it is or \nhow many hours they have worked already. When the Pentagon was on fire, \nthe firefighters in my own State of Maryland dashed across the Potomac \nto help. They were there night and day. We say a grateful Nation never \nforgets. We give our heros parades, but now some want to take away \novertime and make them work for free to protect the homeland. What a \nthing to say to first responders and their families.\n  Every time a firefighter or police officer leaves their home, they do \nnot know when they will be home. They do not even know if they will be \nhome, and now the Bush administration is asking them to donate their \novertime. That is no way to show our appreciation. We need to protect \nthe protectors so that they can protect us. That means protecting their \novertime pay.\n  Nurses and first responders are just a few examples. The Bush \nproposal would deny overtime pay for workers in many industries. It \nwould take money out of the pockets of hard working Americans and their \nfamilies unless we do something to stop it. I urge my colleagues to \nvote to uphold overtime pay by voting for the Harkin amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the \namendment offered by my colleague, Senator Harkin. The Harkin amendment \nwould prohibit the Department of Labor from pursuing a proposed rule to \nmodernize the Fair Labor Standards Act overtime regulations.\n  In 1938, Congress passed the Fair Labor Standards Act to protect the \nlowest paid of our nations working population. The Fair Labor Standards \nAct guarantees overtime pay for all employees who work over 40 hours in \none week, except for those employed in certain ``white collar'' jobs. \nUnfortunately, the current regulations have not been revised since the \n1950s and employers face serious challenges in trying to interpret this \nlaw and classify modern jobs into categories created in a different \nera. Consequently, what should be a simple test, has become a very \ncomplex one with little certainty.\n  Thankfully, this past March, the Department of Labor proposed changes \nthat would update the regulations to reflect the realities of our 21st \ncentury workplace. The purpose of these new\n\n[[Page S11269]]\n\nregulations is not, as many claim, to take away overtime pay from \nhardworking Americans; nobody wants that to occur. The purpose of these \nnew regulations is to bring up to date overtime regulations so that \nemployers will be better able to understand their obligations and \ncomply with the law, and the Department of Labor will be better \nequipped to more vigorously enforce the law.\n  If adopted, the Department of Labor proposal will guarantee overtime \npay for any employee making less than $22,100 per year ($425 per week) \nregardless of the person's job duties. Current regulations only provide \nguaranteed overtime for those making less than $8,060 per year ($155 \nper week). This is almost a 175 percent increase and will mean that an \nadditional 1.3 million employees nationwide will be guaranteed overtime \npay under the proposed changes. In my home state of New Mexico, the \nDepartment of Labor estimates that enactment of this proposal would \nautomatically guarantee overtime pay for 10,000 additional workers, and \nthat these workers would receive $3,878,398 every year in additional \novertime pay.\n  The proposed regulations will not deny overtime pay to any workers \nbased on salary alone; in fact, they will make it easier to determine \nwhich employees meet specific tests and thus qualify for ``exempt'' \nstatus. These exempt employees will continue to qualify for overtime \npay.\n  The proposed regulations will not affect employees paid pursuant to \nthe terms of collective bargaining agreements, thus unionized employees \nwill continue to have the right to bargain for overtime pay, regardless \nof salary or job duties.\n  The proposed regulations will not affect the right to overtime for \nnon-white-collar workers such as police officers, firefighters or other \nfirst responders. This fact has been acknowledged in a recent press \nrelease from the Fraternal Order of Police.\n  Modernization and reform of the Fair Labor Standards Act regulations \nhas been on the Labor Department's regulatory agenda since the 1970s, \nand both Republican and Democratic administrations have recognized that \nthe existing regulations simply do not comport with the realities of \nthe modern workplace. I therefore encourage my colleagues to vote \nagainst this amendment, and support the modernization of the Fair Labor \nStandards Act.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, let us remember what is happening. \nBasically, the Congress is trying to step into the middle of a \nregulatory process, which is ongoing and has not reached a conclusion, \nand short circuit it. Eighty thousand comments have been received \nrelative to these regulations. They have not been promulgated in final \nform. In fact, I know the Department is aggressively reviewing those \ncomments, and I expect substantive changes in significant parts of the \nregulatory proposal as it has been put forth. So it is premature to \nstep in at this time. It is not ripe. The matter is not before us at \nthis time.\n  If the regulations come down in a format that is unacceptable, we as \na Congress have the right to step forward and revoke those regulations, \nas is occurring right now relative to the FCC rule that was promulgated \nby that regulatory agency.\n  So we are stepping forward at the wrong time in the wrong place and \nwe are short circuiting the regulatory process in doing it in this \nmanner.\n  Secondly, what we have heard for the last few days and what we have \nheard nationally from some of the promotional groups that advocate on \nthe other side of this issue is misrepresentation on the number of \npeople involved. They have been saying 8 million people will be \naffected in a negative way.\n  That number is absolutely bogus. Of that number, 1.5 million are \npart-time workers who will not be affected at all; 3.8 million of that \nnumber are already exempt, so they will not be affected; 1.1 million \nwill be exempt under the proposal as it is being proposed, so they will \nnot be affected; and 800,000 are manual workers who will not be \naffected in the first place. So 7.2 million of that alleged 8 million \npeople are off the table and are not going to be impacted. So what we \nare talking about is 800,000 who may be affected by this regulation in \na negative way.\n  On the other side of the coin, let's recall that this regulation \nraises the number at which people get and are guaranteed overtime. \nToday in the workplace, if one makes $8,000, they get overtime. That is \nnot much money. Under this regulation, if one makes $21,000, they are \nguaranteed overtime, no matter what their job description is. That \nmeans it is going to empower 1.3 million people--this is a hard \nnumber--1.3 million people who do not have it today will be getting \novertime under this regulation.\n  So there is a net win for America's workers. At least 500,000 \nAmerican workers are going to come out winners in relationship to \nAmerican workers who may be impacted by this regulation, and that \n800,000 number of people who might be impacted may not be impacted at \nall because they may be union individuals and as a result their union \ncontracts may be negotiated over the overtime issue.\n  The fact is that we should allow this regulation, this process, to go \nforward, allow these 1.3 million people who are going to be \nenfranchised with the right to receive overtime to receive that \novertime, and not short circuit the process and leave these 1.3 million \npeople who would get overtime without the ability to receive this new \nopportunity.\n  This is a proposed regulation. For the Congress to step forward at \nthis time is wrong.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. All time has expired.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

There will now be 2 minutes evenly divided on \nthe Schumer amendment.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, this is a very simple amendment. It adds \n$400 million to the Ryan White fund to deal with the problem of AIDS. \nAIDS is spreading throughout our country. Many rural States that have \nnot experienced AIDS in the past are experiencing large increases. This \nmoney\n\n[[Page S11270]]\n\ngoes to reducing AIDS, the ADAP funding, to the early detection \ncenters, to the centers that develop prevention. If ever there was a \n``stitch in time saves nine'' amendment, this is it.\n  This has broad bipartisan support in the Senate. I hope we will fund \nit. This is not an ideological issue. No one disputes whether \nGovernment should do this. It is not a question of whether the money is \nneeded. We all agree it is needed. I hope we can step to the plate and \nsupport this modest increase so that Ryan White is appropriated at the \nlevel that is needed.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise to state my support for \nSenator Schumer's amendment to increase funding for the Ryan White \nComprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency (CARE) Act.\n  The Ryan White CARE Act is the largest single source of Federal \nfunding dedicated to the care and treatment of people living with HIV/\nAIDS in our Nation. This exceptional program provides funding for \nprimary health care and support services for people with HIV/AIDS who \nlack health insurance and the financial resources to pay for their \ncare. Each year, CARE Act programs nationwide reach over half a million \nindividuals with or at risk for HIV.\n  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimate that \n850,000 to 950,000 people are living with HIV and/or AIDS in the U.S., \nand of those people approximately one-third are not accessing proper \ncare and treatment. CARE Act programs are essential to extending care \nto all those living with HIV/AIDS.\n  Recent reports indicate that the number of patients with HIV/AIDS is \nincreasing faster than the Federal funding. In my own State of Florida \nthat has meant that patients in need have had to delay getting care. \nThe number of people on the waiting lists has never been so widespread \nor long-lasting.\n  According to a recent article in the Sun Sentinel, AIDS Project \nFlorida, Broward County's largest agency serving these individuals, \nexhausted its July funds for medical care before the end of the month \nand had to put newly diagnosed HIV patients on a waiting list to see a \ndoctor.\n  The same article tells us the situation is in Palm Beach County is no \nbetter. The Comprehensive AIDS Program of Palm Beach County has had up \nto three-dozen HIV patients waiting to see counselors at each of three \noffices because of a rush of new clients--including some from Broward.\n  Ryan White CARE Act programs grant vital resources to communities \naffected by this epidemic. This program's comprehensive scope not only \naddresses a patient's health care needs, but also food supplies, \nalternative medicine options, as well as transportation. We cannot \nexpect our communities to meet this growing need without increased \nfunds.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting Senator Schumer's \nefforts to increase funding to this critical program.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I agree with the Senator from New York \nabout the importance of funding to fight HIV/AIDS, but we are funding \nmore than $2 billion for the Ryan White program. We have in the Senate \nbill on AIDS some $14 billion-plus. We have on other Departments \nfunding some $4 million.\n  There has been a certification from the Director of HIV/AIDS that \nthis $2 billion is all that can be appropriately used. We raised a \npoint of order last night. I very much would like to have a larger \nappropriation for this subcommittee to have more money on education and \nhealth care and more money for HIV/AIDS, but we are constrained by the \nbudget resolution and by our allocation.\n  Therefore, I reluctantly oppose the amendment and have raised the \npoint of order. The waiver has been asked for. We are now ready to \nvote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nwaive the Budge Act. The yeas and nays have been ordered.

The point of order is \nsustained and the amendment falls.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1595\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 4 \nminutes evenly divided for a motion to waive the Budget Act with \nrespect to the Reed amendment No. 1595. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senators \nCantwell, Murray, and Dodd as cosponsors of my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I join Senator Collins in urging the \nadoption of an amendment that would add $300 million to the LIHEAP \ncontingency fund. This fund will be available in cases of severe \nweather or severe economic circumstances during this heating season and \nnext year's cooling season. We already know that residential natural \ngas prices are scheduled to rise at least 15 percent. We also \nunderstand poor economic times may force more people into requirements \nto need this program. This is a vital program. This contingency fund \nwould be necessary so that States could meet the needs of heating for \nseniors, for a whole range of people who need heat and need cooling in \nthe summertime in a hot climate. I urge all my colleagues to support \nthe amendment. The underlying bill does have $2 billion for the basic \ngrant program, but without this contingency funding, we will not have \nthe flexibility to respond to spikes in heating costs or in economic \ndownturns in different parts of the country.\n  I yield my remaining time to the Senator from Maine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I join my colleague from Rhode Island in \nurging support for this amendment which would provide additional \nemergency funding for the Low Income Home Heating Assistance Program. \nWhen we experience huge spikes in the increase of home heating oil and \nnatural gas, it imposes an incredible hardship on our low-income \nfamilies and on our elderly who are living on limited incomes. We are \ntaking a prudent action by setting aside $300 million in emergency \nfunding in case this winter we experience the kinds of price \ndisruptions that create such hardships for our constituents. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the amendment.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today as a cosponsor of the \nCollins-Reed Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, LIHEAP, \namendment. This amendment will provide an additional $300 million for \nLIHEAP.\n\n[[Page S11271]]\n\n  Additional funding at this time is critical because of the crisis the \nUnited States is facing with natural gas prices. Natural gas, pinched \nby low inventories and a dearth of new drilling activity, has been \nhovering in the United States at about $6 per million British thermal \nunits, MMBtu. This amount is roughly twice the historical norm. In \nfact, we set records for natural gas prices this past spring and \nsummer. And there is no end in sight. Recently, Federal Reserve \nChairman Alan Greenspan stated that little prospect is seen for natural \ngas prices to fall much in coming months.\n  These historic highs in natural gas prices should be a harbinger for \nthe winter. In fact, if we look to this past winter in anticipation of \nwhat this nation should expect in terms of natural gas prices, the \noutlook is grim. In fact, the utility company that provides my heating \nin Cleveland has already acknowledged the fact that I can expect my \nhome heating costs to at least double this winter. In February of this \nyear, natural gas spot prices reached an historic high of over $18 per \nMMBtu. To compare, the spot price in 2002 was $2.40 per MMBtu during \nthe same time period. That is a 650 percent increase over the previous \nyear.\n  Why are rising natural gas prices important for LIHEAP?\n  In Ohio, of the 235,000 households that receive assistance through \nLIHEAP, 70 percent of them--or 162,500 households are heated by natural \ngas. That means that 70 percent of LIHEAP recipients in Ohio will be \nadversely affected by the rising cost of natural gas.\n  And who are LIHEAP recipients? In Ohio: two-thirds of the households \nthat receive LIHEAP assistance--160,000 households--are below 100 \npercent of the Federal poverty level; one-third are seniors; one-third \nare disabled; and three-fourths of the households have children under \nfive years of age. LIHEAP provides crucial assistance to the least of \nour brethren to help survive the most extreme weather conditions.\n  In Ohio, there is no doubt that home heating costs are going to rise \ndramatically. The doubling of natural gas prices will not allow current \nresources to provide adequate assistance for low-income seniors and \nfamilies. This is going to force folks on low- and fixed-incomes to \nchoose between heating their homes and paying for other necessities \nsuch as food or medicine.\n  This is the environment laid before the Senate: the Nation is facing \nsome of the highest natural gas prices in history with no end in sight; \na soft economy has left an increased number of households in need of \nassistance; and winter is quickly approaching.\n  So where does that leave us?\n  States, which receive LIHEAP funding from the Federal Government, \nwill not be able to adequately plan for the acute need that will \ncertainly occur. The National Energy Assistance Directors' \nAssociation--the folks that run LIHEAP in the States--indicated, in a \nletter dated September 4, 2003, that providing additional funds through \nthe regular FY2004 appropriations process is necessary to plan and \nmanage for the upcoming winter. If States cannot plan, then this in \nturn leaves social service agencies, like the Council for Economic \nOpportunity of Greater Cleveland and Catholic Charities, unable to \nprovide assistance at the local level. The bottom line is that low-\nincome households will be in dire straits when winter rears its head. \nInevitably, if we do not appropriate additional funding now, LIHEAP \nfunds will be depleted and a growing murmur will turn into a cry for \nadditional LIHEAP funds--then to be declared ``emergency funding.''\n  I believe all my colleagues here realize that, at some point, we will \nhave to increase LIHEAP funding. The question is whether we will do so \nnow through the regular FY2004 appropriations process, or through the \nFY2004 supplemental.\n  The responsible action to take would be to increase LIHEAP funding \nnow. Besides being morally responsible, increasing funding now is \nfiscally responsible. Natural gas prices will continue to rise as \ndemand will increase as colder temperature set in. It would be fiscally \nirresponsible for the U.S. Senate not to appropriate additional funds \nthat would better help states and social service providers plan \nassistance for low-income households. And while there is no doubt that \nthe U.S. Senate should appropriate additional funds for LIHEAP now, I \nwould be remiss if I did not take time and reflect on why there is the \nneed to do so.\n  This natural gas crisis is the result of environmental policies that \nhave driven up the use of natural gas in electricity generation \nsignificantly while domestic supplies of natural gas have fallen. The \nresult is predictable, tighter supplies of natural gas, higher energy \nprices and a financial strain on low-income households and a drain on \nour economy. Not only will natural gas prices adversely affect the \nleast of our brethren, these exorbitant prices will also affect our \neconomy. The agricultural community, the steel and metal industries, \nthe chemical and polymer industries and the manufacturing community all \nrely on natural gas and have seen their energy costs skyrocket. Ohio \ncompanies are closing plants, laying off workers and moving their \nproduction overseas due to these high energy prices. I recently met \nwith a group of manufacturers from Cleveland and was shocked when two \nof them told me that they will be forced to move their operations \noverseas unless something is done to give them some relief.\n  In order to deal with this natural gas crisis, we must enact \nlegislation that will increase domestic supplies of natural gas and \nensure that utilities will not be forced to fuel switch from coal to \nnatural gas for electricity generation.\n  I want to commend Majority Leader Frist and Chairman Domenici for \ntrying to pass a comprehensive energy bill that will increase domestic \nsupplies of natural gas, and I am currently working with Chairman \nInhofe to move President Bush's Clear Skies Initiative out of committee \nto ensure that utilities will not be forced to rely solely on natural \ngas. These two important pieces of legislation clearly show that there \nis a fundamental disconnect happening here in Washington. Republicans \nare trying to enact legislation that will address our natural gas \ncrisis, keep energy and home heating costs low and protect American \njobs. Democrats on the other hand are moving in exactly the opposite \ndirection.\n  Democrats are pushing legislation that will establish a Nationwide \ncap on carbon emissions and their passage would force they utility \nsector, that is now coal to generate over half of our Nation's \nelectricity, in my State of Ohio it is 85 percent, to rely solely on \nnatural gas for generation. Carbon-cap language that has been sponsored \nby Senators Jeffords, Lieberman, and Carper, if enacted, will force our \nutilities to fuel switch to natural gas, will significantly raise \nenergy prices and will cause thousands of jobs to be lost, particularly \nin manufacturing States like Ohio.\n  Let me be clear, carbon-caps mean fuel switching. And fuel switching \nmeans moving jobs and production overseas where there are less \nstringent environmental programs and will actually increase global \nlevels of pollution and higher burdens on our poor and elderly.\n  The question we face is whether we should enact comprehensive and \nbalanced energy legislation and Clear Skies, which will help solve our \nnatural gas crisis, or rush into a short-sighted policy that will cap \ncarbon, shut down our economy, cost thousands of American jobs and move \nmanufacturing overseas?\n  The answer is clear. We need to pass the energy bill and Clear Skies. \nAnd we need to move away from harshly ideological positions that \nadvance nothing other than the agenda of national environmental groups \nwho have made a carbon cap a political litmus test. There is an energy \ncrisis in America. Increasing LIHEAP funding is only a temporary \nmeasure to help low-income households get by. If we do not enact a \ncomprehensive energy bill that balances our Nation's environmental and \nconsumption needs, we will be dooming not only low-income households, \nbut our economy as well.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the letter I referenced in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S11272]]\n\n\n                                        National Energy Assistance\n\n\n                                       Directors' Association,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 4, 2003.\n     Hon. George V. Voinovich,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Voinovich: On behalf of the National Energy \n     Assistance Directors' Association, representing the state \n     directors of the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program \n     (LIHEAP), I am writing to urge you to consider providing $3.4 \n     billion for LIHEAP for FY 2004. The increase in funds is \n     necessary in light of the continuing high prices for natural \n     gas and high unemployment rates.\n       Without the additional funding, states will not be able to \n     adjust benefit levels to account for rising natural gas \n     prices. The continuing tightness in natural gas supply has \n     placed very strong upward pressure on price that will keep \n     prices high and volatile into the winter heating season. The \n     Wall Street Journal cites that natural gas prices have risen \n     nearly 3 times the past decade's average. Federal Reserve \n     Chairman Alan Greenspan has also warned that continued high \n     natural gas prices are a serious problem that could \n     jeopardize the economy.\n       Additional funding would allow the states to provide \n     benefits to families who are unemployed as a result of the \n     continuing weakness in the national economy. Current program \n     funding levels are not sufficient to allow states to provide \n     adequate services to these families or support active \n     outreach programs. According to the U.S. Department of Labor, \n     there were more than two million Americans unemployed for \n     more than 26 weeks--up from 692,000 in 2001.\n       By providing these funds now, the states will be able to \n     quickly get the funds in place and to the working, disabled \n     and elderly families households that need them. Please feel \n     free to contact me if I can provide you with any additional \n     information.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Mark Wolfe,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I believe low-income home energy \nassistance is a vital program. I have fought for it during my entire \ntenure in the Senate. Pennsylvania has a problem similar to Maine and \nRhode Island. We have in this budget $2 billion for LIHEAP. Last year \nthere was $1.7 billion in the regular account and $300 million in the \ncontingency fund. This year we improved it. We put all the money into \nthe regular account so you won't have to go to contingency to have the \nextra $300 million spent if certain conditions arise. Had we left the \naccount as it was last year, perhaps this amendment would have been \nobviated or perhaps whatever amount of money we would have put in there \nwould have been an increase. That is a constant occurrence in the \nmanagement of this bill.\n  I must tell you that it gets a little tiresome reading the newspaper \naccounts in the Philadelphia Inquirer and other Pennsylvania papers \nabout how Senator Specter is voting against increases on important \ndiscretionary programs. The fact is, we have funded this program more \ngenerously than last year. Although the total figure is the same, $2 \nbillion, we now have it all in the regular account so you don't have to \ngo to contingency in order to access the $300 million. I would like to \nhave a larger account for this bill to have more money for education, \nmore money for health, and more money for LIHEAP. I know the choice for \nmany people, especially senior citizens, is heat or eat. But we have a \nbudget resolution that this Senator-manager has to stay within the \nlimits. Therefore, I reluctantly have raised the point of order.\n  Mr. REED. Is there any remaining time on my side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five seconds.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, this amendment is fully offset. And even \nwith the $2 billion, not all qualified individuals will receive the \nfunds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nwaive the Budget Act in relation to the Reed amendment No. 1595. The \nyeas and nays have been ordered.

There will now be 2 minutes equally divided on \na motion to waive the Budget Act with respect to amendment No. 1592 \noffered by Senator Reed of Rhode Island.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following \nSenators be added as cosponsors: Senators Lautenberg, Kerry, Clinton, \nand Kennedy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, this amendment would add $50 million for the CDC \nimmunization program under section 317 of the Public Health Service \nAct. My amendment is offset by using the same mechanism that the \nchairman and ranking member utilized on $2.2 billion of the underlying \nbill.\n  Immunization of children is one of the great hallmarks of our public \nhealth system of the United States. It has had remarkable success. \nDiseases such as polio that were terrifying America when I was a child \nhave been eradicated. We have to keep up this effort. This $50 million \nwill add to that effort to be sure we do not lose ground and that we \ncontinue to immunize all our children. It is fully offset, and I urge \nmy colleagues to support the amendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator add my name as a cosponsor?\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Byrd be \nadded as a cosponsor, and also Senator Durbin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I concur that the immunization program--\nvaccines--is vitally important, but I have to point out that we already \nhave in this bill almost $3 billion directed toward vaccines. We have \nthe vaccines for children under the one account in the Centers for \nDisease Control, which currently has $1.145 billion. I suppose if we \nadded $50 million more to that sum, the Senator from Rhode Island would \nstill be asking for more money.\n  It seems no matter how much money we allocate to vaccines, more is \nalways needed--and I believe they are vitally important. Just this past \nweekend, I visited the Centers for Disease Control to be sure they had \nadequate capital resources and buildings to construct these vaccines. \nNo matter how much money we put in, there is always some additional sum \nwhich is asked for.\n  I think the total of $3 billion--and right on top of the issue of the \nSenator from Rhode Island, we have $1.145 billion--that is as good as \nwe can do with\n\n[[Page S11273]]\n\nthe limitations of the budget resolution in the allocation of this \nsubcommittee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on \nagreeing to the motion. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I send a modification of an amendment of \nmine to the desk. I believe I have a right to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification? The \namendment is modified without objection.\n  The amendment (No. 1572), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 76, between lines 10 and 11, insert the following:\n       Sec.__. In addition to any amounts otherwise appropriated \n     under this Act for grants to States under part B of the \n     Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1411 \n     et seq.), there are appropriated an additional $1,200,000,000 \n     for such grants:\n       Customs User Fees.--Section 13031(j)(3) of the Consolidated \n     Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (19 U.S.C. \n     58c(j)(3)) is amended by striking ``September 30, 2003'' and \n     inserting ``September 30, 2004''.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there are 2 minutes \nequally divided for the vote on the motion to waive the budget \nresolution.\n  The Senate will please come to order. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, on the modification, I do not anticipate \na problem, but I would like to have a chance to look at it. May I call \nfor the regular order? I can examine it when we vote next. The regular \norder is to hear from the Senator from Rhode Island for a brief period \nof time before we vote.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1596\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the regular order. The Senator from \nRhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask that Senator Daschle and Senator \nStabenow be added as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, this amendment would add funding for our \nlibraries and museums. We all understand in every part of this country \nthe vital role that libraries and museums play in education and culture \nand in community spirit.\n  Many times President Bush is criticized by Members of Congress for \nnot living up to his expectations in terms of funding. But here is an \nexample where I am proposing to increase funding to the levels \nPresident Bush requested in his fiscal year 2004 budget proposal to the \nSenate.\n  For the Improving Literacy Through School Libraries program my \namendment would add $15.081 million to bring it up to the total of \n$27.5 million that President Bush requested. For the Library Services \nand Technology Act I request an additional $24.1 million to bring it up \nto $171.48 million, the Bush total plus an additional $1.8 million \nneeded to double the minimum state allotment. For the Museum Services \nAct I ask for $5.18 million to bring it up to the total suggested by \nthe President.\n  I believe we should support the President on this one and agree to \nthis amendment. It is fully offset.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I strongly support the Reed amendment to \nincrease funding for libraries and museums in the fiscal year 2004 \nLabor/HHS/Education appropriations bill. This amendment would bring \nfunding for library and museum programs in line with the President's \nfiscal year 2004 budget requests, adding a total of $44.36 million in \nfunding.\n  I do not believe the value of libraries and museums can be \nunderstated. State and local school districts are struggling with \nfunding cuts at the same time that they work to improve achievement and \naccountability as required by the No Child Left Behind Act. Libraries \nplay a critical role in providing students and teachers the resources \nthey need to develop academically and professionally, which will \ngreatly help them meet the mandates of this legislation. Museums have \nthe potential to expand all of our lives and these cultural experiences \nare even more important during economic down turns as they offer a free \nor relatively affordable option to young people and families seeking a \ndiversion. An educational and culturally gratifying outing is an ideal \nway to combine entertainment and enrichment. It is a most appropriate \ntime to provide adequate funding for our Nation's libraries and \nmuseums.\n  This important amendment would increase funding for the Library \nServices and Technology Act, LSTA, by $24.1 million to bring the new \ntotal to $171.48 million. This increase in funding for LSTA would reach \nthe President's funding request of $169.6 million for library state \ngrants and library services to Native Americans, and provide the \nadditional $1.6 million needed to double the minimum state allotment as \nincluded in both the Senate and House versions of the Museum and \nLibrary Services Act of 2003. It would increase funding for the No \nChild Left Behind Act-authorized Improving Literacy Through School \nLibraries program by $15.081 million to reach the President's fiscal \nyear 2004 requested level of $27.5 million. This year, at the current \nfunding level of $12.4 million, the Department of Education has \nestimated it will only be able to fund about 70 of the over 800 \napplications it received from needy school districts across the nation. \nFinally, the amendment would increase funding for the Museum Services \nAct by $5.182 million to reach the President's fiscal year 2004 funding \nrequest of $30.28 million.\n  The success of our young people, especially those in low-income \nneighborhoods, is dependent upon Congress providing the resources \nrequired to educate them and enrich their lives. Throughout my career \nin public service, I have worked closely with members of the Maryland \nLibrary Association, colleges and universities, and others involved in \nthe library community throughout my State to strengthen libraries and \narts programs. I commend Senator Reed's consistent efforts to achieve \nthis goal by providing additional funding for our Nation's libraries \nand museums. I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment so that we \ncan enable libraries and museums to provide the unique and vital \nservices available to all Americans.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. The \nSenate will please come to order. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n[[Page S11274]]\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the allocations for the Institute of \nMuseum and Library Services is obviously very important. We already \nhave a very substantial allocation, as specified in the principal \narguments last night. Here again, much as I would like to increase the \nfunding on this important line--and as I noted as a personal matter, my \nsister, Shirley Specter Kety, is a professional librarian. I am going \nto have a little problem at home over this because she is watching the \nC-SPAN proceedings. But we have made as large an allocation as we can \nunder the Budget Act and the allocation for this subcommittee.\n  We already have $243 million in this account. Again, I wish we could \ndo more, but that is the best we can do. That is why I have raised the \npoint of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion.

The point of order is \nsustained and the amendment falls.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1602\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will be 2 minutes equally divided prior \nto the vote with respect to the amendment of the Senator from New \nJersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, my amendment is pretty simple. It \nrestores cuts to student aid by prohibiting the use of funds for \nimplementation of new regulations put out by the Department of \nEducation reducing the amount of Federal student aid that individuals \nwill receive. This is Federal aid, for Pell grants and subsidized \nloans.\n  The Department of Education estimates these reductions in State and \nlocal tax allowances in computing the expected family contribution \nformula will eliminate Pell grants for 84,000 students across the \ncountry; 49 out of the 50 States are impacted. It will cost $270 \nmillion in Pell grants. The ripple effect, using the same formula \nthroughout all State grants and private grants, could reach into the \nbillions of dollars. And I think all of you know, across the country \ncolleges are raising their tuitions. State and local taxes are going \nup.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote for this \nfully offset amendment.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I would like to make a few additional \ncomments beyond what I said last night about my student aid amendment, \nNo. 1602. In particular, I want to describe my intent as to how the \namendment would work.\n  The amendment says that the Department of Education cannot use any \nfunds to implement the May 30, 2003 updates to the State and local tax \nallowances, to the extent that they would reduce aid for any student.\n  In effect, what the amendment means is that the Department must \nrepublish its State and local tax allowance tables, and use the prior \nallowances in all cases in which the prior allowances were higher, \nwhich is the case for the vast majority of States and types of \nstudents. There were a few cases where the Department got it right. \nThat is, they increased the State and local tax allowances for \nindependent students in a handful of States. And I don't want the \namendment to hurt those students.\n  That is why the amendment qualifies the prohibition on implementation \nor enforcement of the May 30 updates by adding that the prohibition \napplies ``to the extent that such implementation or enforcement of the \nupdates will reduce the amount of Federal student financial assistance \nfor which a student is eligible.''\n  I want to clarify that it is the Department's responsibility to make \nsure this qualifier works by publishing new tables as I just described. \nIt is not intended that college aid administrators would have to figure \nout which students would be hurt by the May 30 updates on a student-by-\nstudent, case-by-case basis at the college level. That would be an \nunnecessary, unwieldy and burdensome approach, and is not my intent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the amendment offered by the Senator from \nNew Jersey is a very complicated amendment which ought not to be \nhandled on an appropriations bill in an amendment to limit funding. It \nought to be submitted to the authorizing committee so the Secretary of \nEducation could be heard on this calculation as to scholarship benefits \nand so the Secretary of the Treasury could be heard.\n  The Senator from New Jersey talked last night about a swing of \nbillions of dollars. This is affecting the flow of money for the \nNational Institutes of Health, which ought not to be affected. The very \ndocument which he has cited, the Congressional Research Service study, \nsays this issue remains ``largely undetermined'' ``without substantial \nand complex modeling.''\n  This is an amendment which ought not to be considered at this time. I \nhope we will not have the traditional party-line vote, which we see all \nthe time invariably here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Anybody who takes a look at this amendment would say, \nfairly stated, it is too complicated to be discussed in 2 minutes after \nan argument last night. It ought to go before the authorizing \ncommittee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Then I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from New Jersey. The yeas and nays have been ordered. \nThe clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, I rise today in support of Mr. Dodd's \namendment, as well as Mr. Jeffords' and Mr. Hagel's. I know Senator \nDayton, my seatmate here, has been a strong advocate of IDEA funding \nand fully funding IDEA, and I want to mention Senator Dayton because he \nis such a great advocate on this issue.\n  There is no commitment we can make, no investment we can make, no \nservice we can perform that is more important to the domestic well-\nbeing of this country than to educate our children. It truly is an \ninvestment in the future.\n  I quote a statement from Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, KS, \nin 1954:\n\n       When I say in these days it is doubtful that any child may \n     reasonably be expected to succeed in life if he is denied the \n     opportunity for an education, such an opportunity is a right \n     which must be made available on equal terms.\n\n  That is what IDEA is all about--providing a quality, equal education \nto our children who are disabled.\n  This proposal by Senator Dodd will increase the funding for IDEA--\nunfortunately, not up to the 40 percent threshold the Federal \nGovernment committed to several years ago but, nonetheless, a sizable \nincrease in IDEA funding. I am very supportive of Senator Dodd and his \nefforts.\n  I also believe that for 27 years, we have found excuse after excuse \nto break our promise when it comes to IDEA. If it is not one thing it \nis another. There is always some reason. There is always some \nexplanation. There is always a promise to do better next year. Senator \nDodd's leadership and this great amendment he is offering is getting us \ncloser to fulfilling our commitment and our promise this year in this \nbill.\n  In 2003, we appropriated only 17.6 percent of the funding for IDEA. \nWe promised to fund 40 percent. We have never come close. In my State \nof Arkansas, we have 58,000 disabled children who will benefit from \nSenator Dodd's amendment.\n  Again, I thank him for his leadership and for his courage in standing \nup on this issue. It is very critical for this country that we educate \nour disabled children.\n  The last point I wish to make before I turn the floor back over to my \ncolleague from Connecticut is that when I was attorney general of my \nState, many of the cases dealt with IDEA. Not in all cases, but in many \ninstances, the fundamental problem and the reason the State was being \nsued was because we were not providing enough money and resources to \neducate our handicapped children. Today, we are taking a step in the \nright direction to do that.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield back the remainder of my time to my \ncolleague from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Arkansas for his \neloquent comments and his support in this effort. He brings a special \nknowledge and awareness to this issue, as we heard, as a result of his \nexperience as attorney general in Arkansas.\n  Like his colleagues, attorneys general around the country have \ngrappled with this issue. As he points out, almost 30 years ago, when I \nfirst arrived as a new Member of Congress with my colleague from \nVermont--President Gerald Ford initiated the idea of the Education of \nAll Children Act--which included, of course, special education. He did \nthis to see to it that far more than 20 percent of special needs \nchildren receiving services at the time would have an opportunity to \nreceive an education. Less than 20 percent of special needs children \nwere being educated 30 years ago.\n  As a result of the efforts of people such as Senator Pryor as \nattorney general in his State, and now as a Member of this body, and \nothers over the years, we have increased the funding for special \neducation, and almost 6 million children across the country today who \nare special needs children are getting help. Several hundred thousand \ninfants are getting help, and several hundred thousand preschoolers are \ngetting help, giving them a chance to maximize their potential.\n  Just this past Monday, I was at the Buttonball School in Glastonbury, \nCT.\n\n[[Page S11276]]\n\nI wish all of my colleagues could have been there with me to see what \nthis remarkable school is doing. They have consolidated the special \neducation children and the services that they need and mainstream them \neach day in their respective classes so they have an opportunity to \nlearn to the maximum extent possible. The affection and the dedication \nof the teachers and assistants who work one on one, in many cases, to \nsee to it that these children have an opportunity to grow and prosper \nis marvelous to see. I know it goes on in every State.\n  As I have said before, almost 30 years ago, we committed to provide, \nat the Federal level, 40 percent of special education funding. To date, \nwe have only gotten up to about 17 percent of that funding. As a result \nof the amendment I am offering today on behalf of myself, Senator \nJeffords, Senator Hagel, Senator Kerry, Senator Collins, Senator \nMurray, Senator Coleman, Senator Bingaman, Senator Dorgan, Senator \nMikulski, Senator Pryor, from whom we just heard, Senator Lautenberg, \nSenator Stabenow, Senator Leahy, Senator Johnson, Senator Clinton, and \nSenator Warner, we are able to offer a $1.2 billion increase in special \neducation funding bringing us from a little more than 17 percent of \ntotal cost to in excess of 21 percent. We are still 19 percent short of \nwhere we need to be, but certainly this amendment is a major step in \nthe right direction.\n\n  If we increase our grants now with the money that is in the \namendment, plus what we are already offering, to the tune of $2.2 \nbillion a year, as we promised, by the way, in the 2004 fiscal year \nbudget resolution, then over the next 7 years, we will meet our 40 \npercent commitment, and we ought to do so.\n  My hope is that we do not have to go through this every year; that we \nwill have these numbers included in the budget process.\n  I am anxious to hear--and I know he is going to address us in a \nmoment--from the Senator from New Hampshire about our ability to hold \nthis in conference. Obviously, we have to deal with the other body. \nPreviously, this body adopted language to increase funding for special \neducation, and the other body rejected it. My hope is that this year \nwill be different. I will be anxious to hear the level of commitment we \nhave to adopt this amendment, have it supported by the House of \nRepresentatives and have it supported by the White House. No other \nissue I can think of engenders as much support as this one does at the \nlocal level. I don't care what State you are from, talk to a county \nsupervisor, talk to a mayor, a first select person, a city council \nmember, they will tell you that in the area of education they need \nhelp. That is why Senator Jeffords has fought so hard over the years, \nSenator Harkin, Senator Hagel--they have been the champions on this \nissue to try and increase the level of funding for special education to \ngive these kids a chance.\n  I am delighted to hear my colleagues are going to accept the \namendment we have offered for the $1.2 billion increase, in addition to \nwhat is in the bill. This is going to make a difference. This is the \nway this body ought to be operating. We need not have to go through \nthese huge battles each year to bring these amendments up in order to \nconvince people that this is deserving of our collective support.\n  With the adoption of this amendment, we are going to make a huge \ndifference for an awful lot of people in the country. While there are a \nlot of other programs I would have liked to have seen in this bill, all \nof us can take some pride in the fact that we have done a good job on \nbehalf of special needs children, their families, and the communities \nthat wrestle every day to provide the resources to see to it they have \nan opportunity to achieve.\n  A special thanks goes to Senator Jeffords of Vermont who has been a \nchampion in this area, and Senator Harkin who has been the leader over \nmany years on special needs children and special education efforts. \nSenator Hagel has been tremendously helpful. Senator Collins, Senator \nColeman, as well as other colleagues over the years, have been \ntremendous champions. Senator Murray from the State of Washington has \nbeen a tremendous fighter on behalf of these children. Senator \nMikulski, Senator Bingaman, of course, Senator Dorgan, and many others \nas well, I thank them for their efforts.\n  We are serving 5.4 million children, 200,000 infants, and 600,000 \npreschool children.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that a list of all 50 \nStates, with the additional amounts of money that will become available \nto them as a result of this amendment being adopted, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as

Madam President, the Dodd-Hagel-Jeffords amendment and the \nmoney in the bill--$2.2 billion--raises considerably the amount of \nmoney that will be available in each of the States as a result of our \nefforts. I thank them for their efforts, and each Senator ought to know \nthere are going to be a lot more children, families, and communities \nwho are going to get needed help.\n  My hope is, of course, that we will keep this language in conference. \nWe tried over the years to do that. We now need Members of the other \nbody to stand up and say to their mayors, Governors, county \nsupervisors, and others: You have our support, and we are going to try \nand do it each and every year between now and the year 2009 to complete \nthe obligation we made some three decades ago.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my \ntime. I see my colleague from New Hampshire who may want to address \nthis issue. I don't know if he does. If he does, maybe we can vote on \nthis and move on to other matters.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has 15 minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. And the Senator from Connecticut?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 3 minutes 42 seconds remaining for \nthe Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I rise to support the amendment offered \nby the Senator from Connecticut, which I think is a good amendment. \nInitially, the proposed amendment used advanced funding, which, in my \nopinion, is inappropriate because it essentially aggravates the deficit \nand tries to escape the budget discipline of our spending caps. The \nSenator from Connecticut has modified his amendment to offset it so the \ndollars being spent will be offset in an appropriate budgetary process \nway that keeps this amendment within the budgetary caps and the \nallocations of this committee.\n  Therefore, I can support it with enthusiasm because it is offset and \nit is an appropriate amendment. In fact, I would have offered an \namendment as an alternative to his had he gone forward with the \nadvanced funding approach which would have accomplished the same goal \non funding but would have also accomplished the budgetary discipline \nthat we needed, which is now reflected in the amendment as offered.\n  I intend to work and be supportive of this amendment in conference, \nalthough I do not chair this subcommittee. Obviously, that is Senator \nSpecter's role, and hopefully we can be successful in the House in \nretaining this number. I think it is important, however, to reflect \nthis number in the context of what has been done in the past and how \naggressively we have tried to fund special education.\n  Trying to get special education funding up has been a priority of \nmine since being in the Senate. When I arrived in the Senate, the \nFederal Government was paying about 6 percent of the special education \ncosts of the local school districts in New Hampshire. The original \nagreement under which the special education act was approved, the \nFederal Government would pay 40 percent of the cost of special \neducation. So the Federal Government was coming nowhere near its \nobligation. As a result, local communities in New Hampshire, through \ntheir local property taxes, were having to pick up the responsibility \nof the Federal Government relative to special needs children. We ended \nup with special needs children being pitted against other children in \nthe school system, parents against parents competing for these \nresources. It was totally unfair to the special needs child and to \ntheir parents because they were being reflected as taking a \ndisproportionate share of the local property tax to benefit or to \naddress their educational needs because of the fact that the Federal \nGovernment was not fulfilling its obligation.\n  I have aggressively pursued trying to increase special education \nfunding. As a result of that initiative, when we took back control of \nthe Senate in 1996, Senator Lott and Senator Specter took on this \ncause. I like to think I encouraged them in that direction, but I think \nthey had that inclination anyway.\n  Significant progress in the area of increasing special education \ndollars has been made since then. In fact, we have now gone from the \nFederal Government paying 6 percent, after this bill, to over 20 \npercent of the costs of special education. It is on a path, especially \nwith this amendment, toward full funding of special education by the \nyear 2009, which is a commitment that many of us have made and tried to \nreach.\n\n  It is also important to note that this effort was made pretty much \nunilaterally by the energy and commitment of the Republican Congress at \nthat time. In fact, historically, the Clinton administration did not \nsend us an increase of any significance in special education funding \nduring its first 7 years in office. It was not until the last year in \noffice that the Clinton administration actually sent up an increase in \nspecial education funding of any significance, and yet during the last \n4 years of the Clinton administration we basically reallocated, within \nthe budget caps that we had at that time, money in the Republican \nSenate and at that time the Republican House, and we significantly \nincreased the funding every one of those years.\n  In fact, there was over a billion dollars of increase each year \nduring that period of time. That was in large part due to the strong \ncommitment made by Senator Specter, who chaired this appropriations \nsubcommittee during that period. So I think it is important to put in \ncontext the effort that has been made in educational funding by \nPresident Bush and by the Republican Congress.\n  Since President Bush has come into office, he has maintained and \ncontinued this effort that was started by the Republican Senate in \ndramatic terms. This chart reflects it in very stark terms. During the \n8 years of President Clinton's term, the increase for IDEA was about \n$400 million in his proposed budgets. During the 3 years President Bush \nhas been in office, his increases in special education funding have \nbeen over $3 billion, with the addition of funding this time in this \nbudget.\n  So every year since he has been in office, President Bush has asked \nfor and made a commitment to significant increases in special education \nfunding--over a billion dollars a year. If we want to put this in some \nsort of statistical context, the average annual increase for special \neducation funding since President Bush has been has been $1.1 billion. \nThat is a 700-percent higher commitment--almost 770 percent--to special \neducation than occurred during the Clinton administration. So the \ncommitment by this administration has been there. In fact, this \nadministration has increased special education funding in just 3 years \nby 53 percent. Special education is the single largest-growing function \nof the Federal Government on a percentage basis. That is a strong, firm \ncommitment to special education.\n  This is another chart that shows it rather starkly. That commitment \nhas essentially been carried forward as a\n\n[[Page S11278]]\n\nresult of a commitment made by President Bush and our party to this \nvery critical element of education.\n  Why are we so committed to special education? Well, there are \nbasically two reasons. One, because special needs children do have the \nright to receive a quality education and, two, local taxpayers have the \nright to be able to use their dollars to fund what they think is a \npriority, not have to use their dollars to fund the Federal \nresponsibility in special education. So we are on a path, an aggressive \npath, led by the President in his 3 years and by this Congress, toward \nfull funding of special education.\n  This amendment increases by $1,200,000,000, the $1 billion increase \nwhich was already in the bill. That is an appropriate step. It also \nalmost assures that we will be on a path toward full funding and as a \nresult will do significant good in relieving local school districts of \nthe pressure which they are getting to fund special education and the \nFederal role in special education.\n\n  Along with the funding issue, however, we have made a significant \ncommitment to trying to improve the quality and the actual terms of the \nprogram. We have reported out of the Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee--which I have the good fortune to chair and on which \nSenator Kennedy is the ranking member--a bill which basically reforms \nthe IDEA program, the special education program. It takes out a lot of \nthe input controls, it takes out a lot of the regulatory morass which \nhas been created over the years and refocuses the emphasis of special \neducation on the child, on output, on making sure the special needs \nchild is actually learning what we think is important and appropriate \nto their skill levels, rather than spending all of our time on \nconsultants, on attorneys, and on highly structured plans which \ninevitably end up with a lot more time being spent on paperwork than \ntime being spent directly on making sure the child can get ahead in \ntheir school system.\n  This bill which we have reported out of committee also allows the \nlocal school district to more effectively deal with the issues which we \nhear most often have affected their ability to make the special need's \nchild experience in the school system constructive and useful. First, \nthe paperwork which I just mentioned, but also the issue of discipline, \nwhere there were different standards of discipline for different \nchildren and as a result there were inconsistencies and it was \ndifficult to maintain decorum in the classroom in some instances, we \nhave tried to address that issue.\n  Hopefully, to some degree, we have also taken out this very litigious \natmosphere that has been out there for far too long where actually in \nsome places such as Washington, DC, an entire cottage industry has been \ncreated which essentially involves litigating all sorts of \nmiscellaneous technical points such as whether a 10-day time frame has \nbeen made versus 11 days, creating very significant costs on the school \nsystems, which basically are drained off to lawsuits instead of going \nto assisting children.\n\n  Significant progress is being made in the area of special education, \nboth on the policy side, where I think we have produced an excellent \npiece of legislation which I hope will be passed by the full Senate \nlater this year, and also on the funding side. Year after year since \nthis President has taken office, we have dramatically increased the \namount of money flowing to special education. This amendment continues \nthat process. It raises the number by $1.2 billion.\n  I believe as we go through the appropriating process, it should be \nfunded within the budget caps, as this amendment does, but it does so \nreally in a manner which is consistent with the Republican effort and \nthis President's effort over his first 3 years in office. He has year \nin and year out made the very substantive commitment to special needs \nchildren that is appropriate and necessary for taking care of those \nchildren and relieving local taxpayers of the burden of paying the \nFederal share.\n  I support this amendment. I expect we will take it on a voice vote. I \nreserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I did not intend to have this become a \npartisan discussion at all. Going back, as a member of the Budget \nCommittee, I offered I think the first such amendment in the Budget \nCommittee, along with Senator Lott. We lost on a tie vote back in the \nBudget Committee in the early 1980s on special education, trying to get \nthe dollars up.\n  I am very grateful. The only reason we are getting this support now \nis that obviously we have some key Republicans who are willing to help \nus on this--Senator Hagel, principally, who has been a champion on this \nissue for a number of years. Senator Collins, Senator Coleman, and \nSenator Warner have been very helpful.\n  Let there be no illusions. We tried to get this. We can argue about \noffsets and so forth, but the fact is, had I not been able to get some \nRepublican support, this amendment would have gone down. I do not make \nthat case because I think it takes both of us working together here. \nBut the reason we are back at this is that, back in the beginning of \n2001, Senator Harkin, Senator Jeffords, and Senator Hagel offered \nlanguage to increase dollars for special education--in fact, they ended \nup getting 100 votes here. The other body, led by the Republican \nleadership, just wouldn't allow a vote to occur on this issue and the \nPresident never had anything to say about it.\n  If we took the increases in the underlying bill, we would never get \nnear the 40 percent figure at which special education would become \nfully funded.\n  The fact is, we have fought this battle especially hard over the last \n2 years. We have gotten zero help from the White House and zero help \nfrom the leadership in the other body. As a result, we are back again \nthis year making our case again.\n  I am very grateful for the bipartisan support we have on this. That \nis the way we get these things done. We are prepared to vote on this, \naccept a voice vote.\n  They don't want a rollcall vote. They only want a voice vote. I was \nborn at night, Madam President, but not last night. I know what that \nusually means--it is so no one has to be on record here. We are just \ngoing to have a vote and go along with this. It makes it a little \neasier for the other body to reject it because we have not had a \nrecorded vote on it.\n  I accept that because I think if you can get something done, get it \ndone, whether it is by voice vote or recorded vote. If we are going to \nget this done, let's get it done. Let's hope it stays in conference so \nthe real winners of this will be the children and the families and the \ncommunities that need the help--not one party over another but people \nwho desperately need our help and support, children who are, \nunfortunately, suffering from special education needs who will get some \nhelp from their Federal Government.\n  Most of special education funding comes from local property tax \npayers. We are just fulfilling an obligation we promised we would meet \n30 years ago and we are coming only halfway there as a result of this \namendment.\n  I am grateful, again, for the support we have received. It is \nunfortunate it has taken us this long. Senator Mark Dayton of Minnesota \noffered a full funding amendment, which I supported, that would get us \nthere right away. Obviously, that did not make it. This is a partial \nstep in that direction. But Senator Dayton deserves a great deal of \ncredit for telling us all how important this issue is and how quickly \nwe ought to meet that obligation.\n  With that, I yield the remainder of my time. If we are going to have \na voice vote on it, let's have that voice vote and move on to other \nbusiness.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am a proud cosponsor of the Dodd-Hagel-\nJeffords amendment No. 1572 to H.R. 2660. I am also proud of the \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act and the 6 million disabled \nchildren who this year have the keys to a brighter, more self-\nsufficient future. But so too am I greatly disappointed in this \nCongress and the President for breaking a promise for 28 straight \nyears.\n  In 1975, we made a deal with our State and local school boards. Give \nour disabled children the education they deserve, we said, and we'll \npay 40 percent of the additional cost, no matter what it takes. An \nexpensive commitment? You bet. But without it, our values of fairness \nand personal initiative are just words on a page.\n\n[[Page S11279]]\n\n  In the nearly three decades since, tens of millions of Americans have \nrisen through the ranks of special education to become independent, \nproductive citizens. They go to college, get jobs, and pay taxes. Every \none of them a shining example of what can happen when people are \nempowered.\n  Yet where they have fulfilled their promise, we have broken ours. We \ncarry just 18 percent of this noble burden on our broad shoulders. Our \nStates stagger under the heavy weight of the rest.\n  We have tried to correct this problem before. In 2001, this body \nwisely passed a version of No Child Left Behind that was true to its \nname.\n  We didn't mean ``no able-bodied child left behind''. We didn't mean \n``no disabled child in private school left behind''. We meant that no \nchild--no child--would be denied the tools needed to succeed. That's \nwhy we included--by a unanimous vote--full funding for IDEA.\n  Unfortunately, George Bush and his henchmen in the House of \nRepresentatives had other ideas. They decided that our tax dollars were \nbetter spent on corporate welfare and massive tax cuts for the \nwealthiest Americans. This amendment would begin to right that wrong by \nrestoring the $1.2 billion for IDEA cut from the Budget Resolution. Use \nthe Republican forward-funding mechanism to pay for it. Get us back on \nthe road to full funding.\n  I know most of my colleagues recognize the desperate needs in special \neducation. But this amendment is about so much more than that. It's \nabout a principal made heart-sick by pitting one group of students \nagainst another. It's about a mainstream teacher on the short end of \nthat equation who loses her job. It's about a mother and father who \njust want their child to have a chance.\n  And right now, it's also about keeping a promise made to our most \nvulnerable children. We must take a stand. We must pass the Dodd/Hagel/\nJeffords amendment on IDEA.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Dodd-Jeffords \namendment. I am proud to support this amendment--the first step to \nfully funding the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, IDEA, in \n8 years. This bill adds about $1 billion over last year's funding level \nfor IDEA. That may sound like a lot. But at that rate it will take at \nleast 30 years to get to full funding.\n  I think it is shocking that Congress passed tax breaks for \nzillionaires while delaying help for those who need it most--the \nchildren with special needs and their parents and teachers. This \namendment increases IDEA funding by another $1.2 billion, for a total \nof $2.2 billion, on pace to full funding in 8 years. We must fully fund \nIDEA to ensure that children with disabilities are receiving the \nservices they need to succeed with their classmates in public schools.\n  In 1975, Congress promised to pay 40 percent of the cost of special \neducation when it passed the Individuals with Disabilities Education \nAct. Yet it has never paid more than 17.5 percent. That means local \ndistricts must make up the difference, either by cutting from other \neducation programs or by raising taxes. I do not want to force States \nand local school districts to forage for funds, cut back on teacher \ntraining, or delay school repairs because the Federal Government has \nfailed to live up to its commitment to special education. That's why \nfully funding IDEA is one of my top priorities.\n  Everywhere I go in Maryland, I hear about IDEA. I hear about it in \nurban, rural, and suburban communities, from Democrats and Republicans, \nand from parents and teachers. They tell me that the Federal Government \nis not living up to its promise, that special education costs about 18 \npercent of the average school budget, that schools are suffering, and \nthe parents are worried.\n  Parents today are under a lot of stress, sometimes working two jobs \njust to make ends meet, trying to find day care for their kids, and \nelder care for their own parents. The Federal Government should not add \nto their worries by not living up to its obligations. With the Federal \nGovernment not paying its share of special education, these parents \nhave real questions in their minds: Will my child have a good teacher? \nWill the classes have up-to-date textbooks? Will they be learning what \nthey need to know?\n  Parents of disabled children face such a tough burden already. School \nshould not be one of the many things they have to worry about, \nparticularly when the laws are already on the books to guarantee their \nchild a public school education. The bottom line is that the Federal \nGovernment is shortchanging these parents by not paying its share of \nspecial ed costs.\n  This bill will give local governments the resources they need to \nimprove education for all children. It will free up money in local \nbudgets for hiring more teachers, buying new textbooks and technology, \nand repairing old school buildings. It will help the teachers who \nstruggle with teaching the toughest students. It will help students \nwith disabilities and their families by providing enough funding for \nspecial education programs so parents can have one less thing to worry \nabout, and students get the opportunities they deserve.\n  Full funding of IDEA is essential. It will give disabled children a \nchance to succeed in school and in life without shortchanging other \nvital education programs. It will give parents peace of mind about \ntheir children's education. I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I rise today to support the efforts of Mr. \nDodd, Mr. Jeffords, and Mr. Hagel, to increase funding for the \neducation of disabled children.\n  I will also note that a few days ago, Senator Dayton offered an \namendment to increase Federal funding for the Individuals With \nDisabilities Education Act to its full amount of 40 percent of excess \ncost to local education agencies.\n  I was proud to support that effort, although it failed, and I want to \nthank him for his tireless efforts on behalf of those who cannot always \nhelp themselves. I was proud to support it if for no other reason than \nto call attention to what is right and what is fair and to where our \npriorities should lay.\n  There is no commitment we can keep, no investment we can make, no \nservice we can perform that is more important to the domestic well-\nbeing of this country than educating our children.\n  By the same token, it doesn't do us any good to educate some while \nleaving others behind. Instead of providing opportunity for all of our \nchildren, we are closing doors. Instead of educating and shaping future \nproductive citizens and leaders, we are, in some cases neglecting those \nwho need our help the most. Those, who if we do not help now, will \nsurely revisit us in the future disguised as another societal problem--\nill prepared for life and solely dependent on the Government.\n  I quote, Mr. President: ``In these days, it is doubtful that any \nchild may reasonably be expected to succeed in life if he is denied the \nopportunity of an education. Such an opportunity, is a right which must \nbe made available to all on equal terms.''\n  That excerpt comes from the decision of Brown v. Board of Education, \n1954.\n  The amendment offered today by the distinguished Senators from \nConnecticut, Vermont, and Nebraska remind us of our commitment to those \nchildren who need our help the most, those children who have been left \nout and left behind, those who have been denied this right.\n  They propose to raise funding for IDEA in the Labor-Health Education \nappropriations bill by $1.2 billion to the budget authorized increase \nof $2.2 billion.\n  This was a budget, incidentally, that we authorized only several \nshort months ago. The IDEA authorization, a bright spot in an otherwise \nmisprioritized budget, was agreed upon by a vast majority of this body. \nNow we find ourselves taking a step back from that vote, from that \ncommitment. A vote, I am sure many of us trumpeted in our press \nreleases and in trips back home.\n  I realize that a lot has happened since we debated and voted on a \nbudget resolution. In the coming days, we will be looking at another \nwar supplemental, revenues are down, and deficits are soaring through \nthe roof.\n  We have many priorities and little money to meet them. These facts \nare not lost on me. But, I also believe that for 27 years, we have \nfound excuse after excuse to break our promise. If it wasn't one thing \nit was another. There\n\n[[Page S11280]]\n\nwas always some reason, always some explanation and always a promise to \ndo better next year. We can start doing better by this Nation's \nchildren this year, right here, right now with this vote.\n\n  This is a highly necessary step to continue us on the path toward \nfully funding IDEA, toward fulfilling the promise made by this body 27 \nyears ago. And I say continue because I recognize that we have \nincreased funding in recent years in this body. I recognize that the \nlevel of funding we have provided to Part B of IDEA has increased by \nover 200 percent since 1996. Even so, if you look at where we started \nwith this legislation, funding less than 7 percent of excess cost, we \nhave woefully shortchanged those whom we have sworn to protect. In \naddition our current funding levels fail to keep pace with escalating \nspecial education costs.\n  To listen to some of our colleagues speak about the ``revolutionary \nincreases'' and massive gains we have made in education funding and \nspecial education funding in specific, one might think that we have \nfulfilled those commitments.\n  But in the history of this legislation, appropriations have never \nneared the 40 percent promise we made to our schools back in 1975. In \nfact, in 2003, appropriations only funded 17.6 percent of the excess \ncost to States. And this is at a time when we are asking our States to \nshoulder more burdens than ever before. This year, the Economic Policy \nInstitute estimates that local communities and States will take on \napproximately $10 billion in unfunded mandate, Federal special \neducation costs.\n  In my State of Arkansas, there are roughly 58,000 disabled children. \nWith adequate Federal funding to IDEA we can provide these children \nmore teachers, we can provide those teachers better training, we can \nreduce class size, and we can create more efficiency in diagnostics. We \ncan do all this while alleviating the pressure to States and localities \nnot to mention lessening the tax burden on individual taxpayers.\n  Some of my colleagues might tell us we cannot afford to fund IDEA at \nthe levels it needs to be funded. I would say we can't afford not to. \nIf this is not a priority for us now, I ask if it will ever be?\n  It was once said by Hubert H. Humphrey that the moral test of \ngovernment is how that government treats those who are in the dawn of \nlife, the children; those who are in the twilight of life, the elderly; \nand those who are in the shadows of life, the sick, the needy, and the \nhandicapped.\n  Well, this is a discussion about those in the dawn of their lives and \nwe in this body, we in government have an opportunity to save these \nchildren from being cast in the shadows of life.\n  I am not sure if there is anyone in this body that disagrees to \nwhether or not IDEA works.\n  Prior to IDEA's passage, nearly half of all children with \ndisabilities were not allowed to enroll in public schools. The \nremaining half were segregated in inadequate classrooms.\n  Today, over 6 million children with disabilities receive a free \nappropriate public education, because of IDEA. Since IDEA was enacted, \nthe number of young disabled adults in college has tripled. The \ndisabled child dropout rate has decreased by more than 50 percent.\n  These are wonderful results. Imagine the results we could attain, if \nwe funded this legislation to the appropriate levels.\n  We made a commitment; we should keep it. I think we owe our children \nthat much. They reap the rewards or pay the price for the policies we \nenact today. They are the ones who cannot defend themselves.\n  As I prepared to speak on this issue I read the debate that preceded \nthe passage of the `Education for All Handicapped Children Act,' in \n1975. I tried to perhaps shed some light on the intent of Congress in \npassing this legislation. Immediately I saw the importance members of \nthat distinguished body placed on funding special education.\n  In fact, Senator Javits from New York, a Republican, said ``Again, I \npoint out, Mr. President, that we have only appropriated $100 million \nunder the present law, part B of the Education of the Handicapped Act, \nwhich authorizes $666 million yearly. Mr. President, this shows our \nlack of the right priorities and our deficiencies.''\n  Senator Stafford, a Vermont Republican, said ``If enacted into law, \nthis bill will finally begin to bring to all the handicapped children \nof our Nation what has always been their right--a free appropriate \npublic education.''\n  A beginning. Both of these distinguished Senators from the other side \nof the aisle understood where we were, where we had to go, and how we \nhad to get there. They knew that we could do better by our children. \nAnd so do Senators Dodd, Jeffords, Hagel, and Dayton.\n  I appreciate their leadership on this issue, and I wish to join them \nin making sure that we do better by our children, and I urge my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has 3 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I yield the remainder of my time and I \nurge the question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment, \nas modified.\n  The amendment (No. 1572), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DODD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, on behalf of the manager, I ask \nunanimous consent that the previous agreement be modified so that \nfollowing the second Durbin amendment, Senator Ensign be recognized to \noffer an amendment regarding afterschool; further, that there be 10 \nminutes equally divided for debate. I further ask unanimous consent \nthat following the last amendment on the previous list, Senator \nLandrieu be recognized to offer an amendment relative to mosquitos; \nagain with 10 minutes equally divided in the usual form. Finally, I ask \nunanimous consent that the remaining provisions of the agreement be \napplicable to the Ensign and Landrieu amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, reserving the right to object, in effect, \nfollowing the Durbin amendment under the previous order that has been \nentered, we will have the Ensign amendment and the Landrieu amendment, \nand then the leader will set a time to vote after they debate those.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I will send an amendment to the desk. I \nask if I have 15 minutes to present this amendment. Is that accurate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1609 To Amendment No. 1542\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I send the amendment to the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer], for herself and \n     Mr. Lautenberg, proposes an amendment numbered 1609.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide additional funding for afterschool programs under \n          the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965)\n\n       On page 76, between lines 10 and 11, insert the following:\n       Sec.  . In addition to any amounts otherwise appropriated \n     under this Act for afterschool programs carried out by 21st \n     Century Community Learning Centers under part B of title IV \n     of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 \n     U.S.C. 7171 et seq.), there are appropriated an additional \n     $250,000,000 for such programs: Provided, That of the funds \n     appropriated in this Act for the National Institutes of \n     Health, $44,000,000 shall not be available for obligation \n     until September 30, 2004: Provided further, That the amount \n     $6,895,199,000 in section 305(a)(1) of this Act shall be \n     deemed to be $7,145,199,000: Provided further, That the \n     amount $6,783,301,000 in section 305(a)(2) of this Act shall \n     be deemed to be $6,533,301,000.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask if my colleague from Nevada would like to take some \ntime now for a consent request.\n\n[[Page S11281]]\n\n  Mr. REID. No, I would just like to be added as cosponsor of the \nSenator's amendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would be proud to add Senator Reid as a cosponsor. I \nmake that request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, as we look at the request for $87 \nbillion, most of it for Iraq, I hope we will find it in our hearts to \nlook at the millions of children in our own country who are waiting to \nget into afterschool programs.\n  When we passed the No Child Left Behind Act, we made a promise to our \nchildren. I want to focus on that promise as it pertains to afterschool \nprograms.\n  This is a blowup of a little of the act itself.\n  It is the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 that President Bush is \ntalking about everywhere he goes in the country but unfortunately is \nunderfunding.\n  It is very clear. It is in black and white. The No Child Left Behind \nAct spelled out exactly what was supposed to be spent on afterschool \nprograms for our children. In the year 2002, we were supposed to spend \n$1.250 billion; in 2003, we were supposed to spend $1.5 billion; and in \n2004--the bill we are debating now--we were supposed to spend $1.750 \nbillion.\n  If this were an exam that our children were giving us, we would fail \nand fail miserably.\n  Afterschool is a great program. That is why this afterschool act \nwhich is part of the No Child Left Behind Act was supported by both \nsides of the aisle. It was written by myself and Senator Ensign. But I \nhave to say, as the author of this bill, that it saddens me greatly to \nrealize we are breaking our promises to children.\n  Let me show you how we have broken those promises. It is a sad \nchapter in our history. I told you that the No Child Left Behind Act \ncalls for $1.7 billion this year. The Bush budget was $600 million. Not \nonly would he not fully fund the No Child Left Behind Act but he cut it \nfrom the $1 billion level that is in the current bill before us. I \ncommend my colleagues for at least adding $400 million and getting it \nup to level funding. The Boxer amendment doesn't even meet the \ncommitment of the No Child Left Behind Act. If it did, I would be \nadding $750 million. But in an effort to win the votes of my \ncolleagues, I am asking for $2.25 million.\n  The No Child Left Behind Act says we should be spending $1.75 \nbillion. The Bush budget, with only $600 million, throws thousands of \nchildren out of coverage. The Senate bill comes to us with $1 billion, \nand I am attempting to begin moving this funding to where it would \nreach what the No Child Left Behind Act has promised. We are breaking a \npromise to our kids. I want to translate this money into children so \nthat you see how we are not just talking numbers but we are in fact \ntalking about children.\n  In the Bush budget, if we had not changed the number in the No Child \nLeft Behind Act, 1.6 million fewer children than we promised would have \nbeen covered. Under the Senate bill right now, 1.1 million fewer \nchildren are covered. Even under my amendment, 800,000 fewer children \nthan we promised would be covered.\n  To put it another way, the No Child Left Behind Act was supposed to \ncover 2.5 million children--our present children--after school. \nInstead, the Bush budget would cover 850,000 kids; the Senate \nappropriations committee, 1.4 million kids; and the Boxer amendment \nwould cover 1.7 million children.\n  Even though we are not going to fully cover the 2.5 million children \nthe act promised, at least we are moving up from where we are; 300,000 \nmore children will be covered by the Boxer amendment.\n  The demand for afterschool care is great. According to the Department \nof Labor, the parents of more than 28 million school-age children work \noutside the home. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, as many as 15 \nmillion latchkey children go home to an empty house.\n  Where are our family values? You are a devoted mother, Madam \nPresident. You know how important it is for the children to have \nsomeone to be there when they come home from school. Yet we are \ndepriving millions of children whose parents can't afford to have a \nbabysitter there, who can't afford to enroll them in some private \nafterschool program.\n  What does latchkey kids mean? They have a key, they let themselves \nin, and they are on their own. The parents can't afford programs for \nthese children.\n  Mayors surveyed in six cities reported that only one-third of \nchildren needing afterschool care were receiving it. And the need for \nFederal help is growing.\n  In Minnesota, for example, State budget cuts are forcing schools and \ncommunity partners to scale back or cut after-school enrichment \nprograms.\n  This means that in Duluth, the Lincoln Park Youth Collaborative, \nwhich unites the Lincoln Park School with such organizations as \nLutheran Social Service, the Boys & Girls Club, Duluth Family YMCA and \nNeighborhood Youth Services, will be dissolved. Additionally the Boys & \nGirls Club in Duluth is scaling back hours and activities.\n  Currently, more than 80 percent of the 665 students at Lincoln Park \nSchool participate in one or more of these programs. How are people in \nDuluth reacting? According to the Duluth New Tribune, they are afraid--\nafraid that youth crime and violence will increase. And the children \nare devastated, as Tylor, a Lincoln Park seventh grader put it, ``How \nwould they feel if they were kids and we were the ones taking the money \nand they wouldn't have anything to do?''\n  We know that when our schools close down, their afterschool \nprograms--which is what is happening now because they are so short of \nfunding. It is very devastating to children. It is very devastating to \ntheir families. And the teachers suffer because the kids are just not \nwhat they were before. They are not ready for school. They don't have \nmentors to teach them and to work with them one on one after school. \nAfterschool care is not a luxury; it is a critical investment in our \nchildren's future.\n  I want to show you a chart that shows juvenile crime. You might say \nit is a no-brainer. But I think it is worth looking at an FBI chart. \nWhat is it showing? Juvenile crime soars to its highest rate between \nthe hours of 3 and 6 p.m. It just goes way up as soon as school ends. \nWe all know this intuitively. But this is a FBI statistic.\n  What is happening is very clear. According to the National Center for \nJuvenile Justice, children are more likely to be involved in crime, \nsubstance abuse, and teenage pregnancies if they are left on their own \nafter school. We know from studies that these afterschool programs \nwork. They reduce crime. They reduce drug use. They reduce teenage \npregnancies.\n  We have studies done by Quantum Opportunities. We have researchers \nfrom Columbia University and the American Health Foundation. They \ncompared five housing facilities without Boys & Girls Clubs to five \nsimilar facilities with Boys & Girls Clubs. By the time the study was \nconcluded, housing facilities without the Boys & Girls Clubs had 50 \npercent more vandalism and they had 37 percent more drug activity.\n  It is no surprise then that law enforcement supports afterschool \nprograms. In a poll conducted by George Mason University, 86 percent of \npolice chiefs nationwide said that expanding afterschool programs will \ngreatly reduce youth crime and violence.\n  I will show you a quote from Sheriff Drew Alexander from Summit \nCounty, OH--right from the heartland. This is what he said:\n\n       We can pay now for afterschool programs and invest in \n     success. Or we can plan to spend far more later on prisons \n     for our failures, and funerals for their victims.\n\n  When I first got into politics and into local government, those of us \nwho wanted to invest in things such as afterschool and early childhood \neducation had arguments with law enforcement. They didn't agree. They \nsaid: We will get the criminal after the crime is committed.\n  They have changed dramatically. They are now on the front lines. They \nare my best helper in helping to get back-to-school programs, which we \nhave enacted here. They have been my best helper in rounding up \nvotes. I hope they have been successful today. We are going to find out \nlater.\n\n  What is also remarkable is that while the administration cut \nafterschool funding in half, throwing millions of children out of \nafterschool programs,\n\n[[Page S11282]]\n\nanother arm of the administration was saying in a paid-for \nadvertisement. This is an amazing paid-for advertisement from our \ngovernment: ``It's 3 p.m. Do you know where your kids are?''\n\n       Times have changed. Keeping kids off drugs means knowing \n     what they're up to. Especially after school. There are ways \n     to do it.\n\n  And they talk about various ways to keep your eye on your children. \nThis is remarkable. It comes from the Office of National Drug Control \nPolicy.\n  While the administration is spending money asking parents where their \nkids are after school, on the other hand, with their red pencil they \nare cutting the funding for afterschool. I don't know how this makes \nany sense. I was fortunate enough to spend the month of August in my \nhome State. I went to a number of afterschool programs, as I have done \nover the years. As a matter of fact, I have made 23 visits to \nafterschool programs. I will show some of the pictures of the kids I \nhave seen in these afterschool programs.\n  Here is a picture from Sacramento Start. These kids are thoroughly \ninvolved in work. They are playing a learning game. They are engrossed, \ninstead of being home alone, watching cartoons, or out on the street \ngetting into trouble.\n  Here is another picture from Sacramento Start. A mentor came in with \nthis huge alligator. All the kids are standing around in amazement. \nThere is not one disinterested look, not one idle face in the room. It \nis so exciting what can be done and what is happening in California and \nacross this country in afterschool programs.\n  Here is an afterschool program at Sullivan Middle School in \nFairfield, CA. We call this program, which I visited, The Place To Be \nAfter 3. These kids are shining. Walk in there and anyone will see they \nfeel proud of who they are and what they are doing. You can see from \nthe smiles on their faces. When you ask them why, and I do every time I \ngo to one of these programs, they say, ``We are safe. Kids ask us to do \nthings after school that are not good and we just say, 'We can't. We \nare in afterschool programs.''' They come home; they have done their \nhomework; they can have family time. When mom and dad get home--or if \nit is a single-parent household, they are exhausted. They have to make \ndinner, make sure the child is bathed and ready for the next morning. \nThe bottom line is the child comes home, the homework is done, and they \ncan then bond with the parent.\n  It really works.\n  I will read some of what students have told me. One of L.A.'s best \nstudents said:\n\n       The most important thing I learned was that anything I set \n     my mind to, I can do.\n\n  That is from a fifth grader at Hart Street Elementary School.\n  Another from Manchester Avenue Elementary School said when asked what \nhe most liked:\n\n       There are no strangers to harm us, because the teachers are \n     around.\n\n  From a fourth grader at Canoga Park Elementary School:\n\n       I know if I'm in trouble, I can turn around and they'll be \n     there for me.\n\n  And then a parent of a student:\n\n       My daughter has gone from the bottom 30% to the top 25% \n     after joining the LA Best afterschool program.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record other stories \nof other children.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Mauricio's Story, Los Angeles, CA\n\n       Mauricio was a first grader at Langdon Elementary School in \n     North Hills. He faced the strong possibility that he would be \n     involved with gangs, drugs and violence. Instead he became \n     one of the first participants in LA Best. Through LA Best, he \n     came into contact with police officers and tutors, who gave \n     him an alternative to gang life. He was so affected by the \n     program that he worked at LA Best's Langdon site through high \n     school and still volunteers as he works his way through \n     college. Selected to introduce Mayor Richard Riordan for the \n     Mayor's sixth State of the City address, Mauricio said: ``I \n     would never have imagined as a 6-year old that I would be \n     introducing the mayor . . . I saw a lot of young people doing \n     drugs and crime and dying, but today, I am the first member \n     of my family to attend college.'' Mauricio's plans to be a \n     teacher: ``Young people need someone to look up to and \n     someone to help them--I want to give them what people gave to \n     me.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                     Jerry's Story, Los Angeles, CA\n\n       Although only 10 years old, Jerry was acting out in school, \n     hanging out with gang members and disobeying his parents. His \n     parents began to work with LA Best staff to ensure close \n     supervision of Jerry when he was on the playground. Family \n     counseling and increased emphasis on academics were also part \n     of a carefully developed plan for him. Soon Jerry was \n     involved in computer and geometry classes, the Science Club \n     and sports.

He was still in the program through high \n     school. Kyrus's mother was a single parent raising three \n     children and was grateful that her kids were somewhere safe \n     in the afternoons before she got home from work. The \n     afterschool program at Kyrus' school allowed him to work at a \n     day care center and to do peer mediation in school. He said: \n     ``The afterschool program has made a huge impact on my life. \n     It's opened doors for me that have helped me learn, helped me \n     contribute to my community and helped me get into the college \n     of my choice . . .''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                     Vicki's Story, Morgantown, WV\n\n       Vicki's mom is a stay-at-home mom and a Marine Reservist. \n     After 9/11, her mom was called up to active service, leaving \n     Vicki nowhere to go after school but to an empty house. \n     Vicki's father reports that the afterschool program Vicki \n     attends, Kaleidoscope, has made a big difference in not only \n     her life but in the family's life as well.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will wrap up right now by saying, we need to look \ninside our hearts. We represent American children. They need our help. \nThese programs work. These programs deserve to be fully funded because \nthe President and the Congress passed the No Child Left Behind Act. To \nfreeze these programs for another year makes 3 years in a row.\n  How can I tell my kids that the kids in Iraq are more important than \nthem?

I believe under the unanimous consent I am in line to \noffer an amendment and I send an amendment to the desk for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). Without objection, the pending \namendment is set aside. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Ms. Landrieu] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1610.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To increase funding for the promoting safe and stable \n                           families program)\n\n       On page 61, between lines 14 and 15, insert the following:\n       Sec. __. (a) Promoting Safe and Stable Families Program.--\n     In addition to amounts otherwise appropriated under this Act \n     for the promoting safe and stable families program of the \n     Administration on Children and Families, there are \n     appropriated an additional $100,000,000 for the \n     Administration on Children and Families to fund such program.\n       (b) Independent Living Training Vouchers.--In addition to \n     amounts otherwise appropriated under this Act for independent \n     living training vouchers, there are appropriated an \n     additional $18,000,000 for such vouchers.\n       (c) Offset.--Of the funds appropriated under this Act for \n     the National Institutes of Health, $70,000,000 shall not be \n     available for obligation until September 30, 2004. The amount \n     $6,895,199,000 in section 305(a)(1) of this Act shall be \n     deemed to be $6,995,199,000, and the amount $6,783,301,000 in \n     section 305(a)(2) of this Act shall be deemed to be \n     $6,683,301,000.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I inquire of the Chair the time allotments for this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 10 minutes on this amendment.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Let me be very brief before the Senator from California \nleaves the floor to say I ask her to add me as a cosponsor to the \namendment just presented. She made a beautiful presentation, quite \ncompelling about why this Congress should step forward\n\n[[Page S11283]]\n\nand live up to the commitments we made in a bipartisan fashion with the \nPresident of the United States to create and pass a landmark piece of \nlegislation. That only works if the funding is attached. The Senator \nfrom California has been so eloquent, saying because the funding has \nnot been attached, it is questionable whether the whole act will work. \nI commend the Senator and add my name as a cosponsor to her amendment.\n  I move on to describe my amendment, which is complementary but not on \nthe same subject. The amendment I send to the desk is equally as \nimportant to Louisiana as the amendment presented by Senator Boxer, \nwhich would have provided in Louisiana the opportunity for our \nGovernor, who is Republican--I am a Democrat, he is a Republican--and \nour board of elementary and secondary education, made up of Democrats \nand Republicans, her amendment would make it possible for the reformers \nin our State, made up of members of both parties, to give opportunities \nfor children who find themselves in very difficult situations with no \nplace to go, both parents required to be working or choosing to work, \nand children needing opportunities after school.\n  This amendment I have sent to the desk funds a similar program that \nhelps stabilize families but in a different way. It actually builds on \na bipartisan effort led on this side by the Senator from West Virginia, \nMr. Rockefeller, years ago, that recognized a failing in our foster \ncare system.\n  Let me give a minute of background, although the time is very short. \nWe actually have 570,000 children in foster care in the country; about \n6,000 are in foster care in Louisiana. It is very unfortunate that \nchildren find themselves in foster care at all. We would, of course, \nlike to have a child welfare system in this Nation where, first of all, \nevery child stays in the family to which they are born. We would love \nfor every child to be wanted and nurtured and loved and every family to \nbe strong enough to be able to nurture those children and bring them up \nin a family environment, of course, educating them and sending them off \nas we wish for our children whom we raise and for all the children in \nAmerica.\n  Unfortunately, that situation does not exist in every family for a \nvariety of reasons. Sometimes the parents are simply unable. In some \nawful situations they are unwilling--drugs, alcohol, very dysfunctional \nfamily situations sometimes cause children to be removed from those \nfamilies, placed into foster care, and then the system is supposed to \nwork.\n  We spend $8 billion a year on that system. And there are serious \nefforts underway to reform that system.\n\n  This Senator is convinced we could serve families better, serve the \nchildren better, promote adoption, promote family reunification, \nprevent child abuse actually for less money if we designed this program \ndifferently. And those efforts are in the works.\n  Recognizing this program needed so much reform and support, and \nrecognizing the difficulty because it is a very complex, huge Federal \nprogram that has been developed over the last 30 years in pretty much \nof a hit-and-miss kind of fashion, Senator Rockefeller came up with a \nfabulous, excellent, effective bill several years ago called Promoting \nSafe and Stable Families.\n  We passed the bill about 7 years ago. The bill basically says we \nrecognize we have this $8 billion Federal program that could work \nbetter, and we are going to work on reforming it, but while we are \ndoing that, let's make sure we are doing everything we can to help \nStates and courts prevent children from going into the foster care \nsystem--in other words, reducing child abuse; in other words, giving \nfamilies support at the front end, so that children do not go into \nfoster care, so we do not have almost 600,000 children having to be \ntaken away from their families and moved into a system, sometimes to \nlanguish for years.\n  Then Senator Rockefeller and others--this was a bipartisan effort--\nsaid: Let's create a program on the back end so that when these \nchildren ``age out''--at that time it was 18; now it is 21--we give \nthem another step so they can become productive adults. Although they \nhave lost their families--many of the parental rights have been \nterminated--because our system has failed them; they were not adopted--\nat least let's give them a college education. That is Promoting Safe \nand Stable Families.\n  I think the American people, whether they are liberal, conservative, \nDemocrat, or Republican, could most certainly understand the benefit of \nspending a small portion of money to make sure the $8 billion we are \nspending is being spent as wisely as possible, to prevent the \ntaxpayers, basically, from picking up the tab for a program that is not \nworking.\n  The fact of the matter is, this bill, even though the President \nrequested the program to be at a level of $504 million, for which he \nshould be commended--he has been criticized, and a great deal of that \ncriticism, actually, I believe, should be leveled in his direction. But \nin this case, it is actually the opposite. The President put $504 \nmillion in his budget. I commend him for doing that. Yet this \nunderlying bill is shorting that program by over $100 million.\n  My amendment seeks to fully fund Promoting Safe and Stable Families \nto the level President Bush requested. Again, that request was made \nbecause Democrats and Republicans believe this program is a way, first, \nto make sure the $8 billion taxpayers are spending right now is spent \nin the appropriate ways, and making sure we have the flexibility given \nto our States and local governments to prevent children from coming \ninto foster care. And that is done by supporting community-based \nprograms, time-limited family reunifications, and, in my opinion, most \nimportantly, promoting adoption and the support services that go along \nwith adoption.\n  Then, at the back end, this money would be given to States. It would \nbe very flexible. States can design their own programs. It is given to \nthe States in a very flexible way to make sure that if the system is \nfailing--and right now it is failing thousands and thousands of our \nchildren--when the system takes their parents away, and then when the \nsystem fails to provide another family for them, the least this \nCongress could do, I would argue, for the most vulnerable children in \nAmerica--some of these children are poor, some of them are not, some of \nthem came from homes of middle-income families--the least we could do, \nthough, for this group of children who have no parents to advocate for \nthem, who have no family to advocate for them, is to fully fund the \neducation component this Congress wisely put in place that gives \nchildren an opportunity, when they age out of foster care, to go on and \ntry to build a life, despite the difficulties they have, to stay out of \nprison, to stay out of mental health hospitals. That is what this \namendment does.\n\n  In conclusion, this amendment, which adds about $100 million to the \nunderlying bill, would meet the President's request. It would fund the \nauthorization of Promoting Safe and Stable Families. It would attempt \nto help the 1 million children last year in the United States who were \nconfirmed as victims of abuse and neglect. It would do it in a way \nwithout Federal mandates, without Federal regulations, but would give \nthe money to the States and to our cities and to our local communities \nto design these programs in the way they see fit.\n  In closing, Mr. President, let me just add some words from children \nwho have actually received the benefit of this program. Let's listen to \nwhat they say in their own words about this program.\n  The first is written by Belinda J. from Juniata College in \nPennsylvania. She says:\n\n       There are not enough words to express my gratitude to you \n     for donating money to further my education. When I received \n     the award letter--\n\nwhich this amendment would fully fund--\n\n       I was speechless and almost started to cry. All those years \n     I worked hard in school because I knew I wanted a career in \n     science. I had a dream and people like you--\n\nspeaking to the Members of Congress--\n\n     helped me fulfill that dream. Things still do not come easy \n     to me and I still face the same challenges that I had in \n     foster care, but your belief in me has helped keep me going \n     towards my goal. At this point in my life, I do not know if I \n     am going to be a doctor, a scientist or a forensic \n     investigator, but I do know whom to thank when I become one \n     of these.\n\n\n[[Page S11284]]\n\n\n  This is a young woman who has no parents.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for one \nadditional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. The program I am attempting to fully fund meets the \nPresident's request. This is unlike some other amendments where the \nPresident underfunded it and the committee did the same. We just simply \nhave not found the will to fund the program. This is a program the \nPresident put in his budget at a $540 million level, and it is being \nunderfunded.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that statements from other \nindividuals who have benefited from this program be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       In the three years that I've been involved with the OFA, \n     they have gradually been able to increase my scholarship to \n     help meet my financial needs, Thanks to Scholarship Sponsors \n     this year I received a $10,000 award which was substantially \n     higher than previous years. Last year I did housekeeping in \n     the morning, went to class in the afternoon, and worked at a \n     restaurant at night just to pay my college expenses. Working \n     two jobs and balancing school was really difficult. This \n     year, the scholarship made a huge difference in my life, I \n     only work 15 hours a week at one job. Because I work fewer \n     hours, I have more time to focus on my studies.

If it was not for your concern \n     and compassion for orphans, a lot of us would not have the \n     opportunity to go to school and expand their academic and \n     even social horizons. Again, I say thank you for supporting \n     orphans all over the country.\n                                                       Laverne B.,\n     Howard University, DC.\n                                  ____\n\n       Today I received a call from the financial aid office \n     telling me to come sign for a scholarship from OFA.

Mr. President, I will ask for a vote on this amendment \nat the appropriate time. I hope the Congress will find a way to fund \nthis program, which saves us from foolishly spending the $8 billion we \nare already spending, and to support programs such as this that do so \nmuch good for the children in our country.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, there is no doubt about the importance of \nthe program responding to a widespread perception of a crisis in the \nNation's child welfare system, that there has been an increased \ncaseload of the foster care system, and the program had no funding at \nall in 2001. In 2002, the funding was slightly under $70 million. It \nwas a new program that year which is the reason there is zero under the \nappropriation line for 2001. Starting off as a new program, it was \nfunded at slightly under $70 million, $69.986 million. In this fiscal \nyear of 2003, there was $29 million plus added, bringing the total to \n$99.350 million. It would be highly desirable if we had the extra \nfunding to accommodate more money, but we are at the maximum level of \nthe allocation this subcommittee has from the budget resolution.\n  When the Senator from Louisiana asks for $18 million additional for \nindependent living training vouchers, that, again, is a program that I \nwould like to see funded at a higher level. The grave difficulty is \nthat the pleas the Senator from Iowa and I made as managers of the bill \non our allocation were not heeded, and we have made the distribution as \nbest we can.\n  It is with reluctance that I have to oppose the amendment offered by \nthe Senator from Louisiana. That is the essence of the situation.\n  How much time remains on the amendment on my side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five and a half minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I am prepared to yield that back, Mr. President, and \nmove to the next amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, would the Senator object to giving me 2 \nminutes of his time to wrap up?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I will reclaim my 5 minutes so I may give the Senator \nfrom Louisiana 2 minutes. If she is going to speak, I want to reserve \nthe remainder of the 3.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I appreciate the chairman's comments. I \nknow how hard he and the Senator from Iowa have worked to keep this \nbudget within the limits established. As a member of the Appropriations \nCommittee, I am well aware of the process.\n  It seems as though the Republican leadership has allowed spending for \nprograms using an advance funding mechanism for the priorities they \nbelieve are important; yet while saying they think this priority is \nimportant, they refuse to accept amendments that basically use the same \noffset. I want to make clear for the record that the funding for this \nwould come from the exact same provision that the chairman has used for \nother programs in the health, welfare, and education bill. Yet it seems \nwhen it comes to full funding for Leave No Child Behind or full funding \nfor a program the administration says it fully supports, there is all \nof a sudden no money available.\n  Again, this has been one of the priorities of this administration. \nLeave No Child Behind is something this administration speaks about on \na daily basis. Yet there are billions of dollars of shortage in funding \nin that program. That is not just another Federal program. It was a \nvery important historic meeting of the minds on how to reform education \nand how to give cities--whether it is Washington, DC, or New Orleans or \nrural areas throughout the country--the resources they need to reform \npublic education. Also, upgrading foster care, promoting adoption, \nmaking sure that every child has a family, a loving and stable home \nbecause that is the fabric and essence of our society, again, we find \nthat the will is simply not there. That is what I wanted to say in \nresponse.\n  I understand this amendment will not be accepted. I wanted to say \nthat it seeks the same sort of offset that other programs have in the \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I respect what the Senator from Louisiana \nhas offered. They are very important programs. We have funded them to \nthe maximum extent that we can, consistent with the allocation which we \nhave under the budget resolution. When the comment is made about \noffsets, that is an effort on accounting procedures to put money back \ninto fiscal year 2003. But that doesn't address directly the budget \nresolution or the allocation that this subcommittee has.\n\n[[Page S11285]]\n\nWe are up to the full expenditure of $137.6 billion.\n  We are now prepared to turn to the first amendment by the Senator \nfrom Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1611 To Amendment No. 1542\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for calling on me and \nallowing this unanimous consent request which gives me an opportunity \nto present an amendment.\n  Most of us in the Senate joined President Bush in voting for No Child \nLeft Behind. When the President took office and said he wanted to make \na bipartisan commitment to change education in America, many of us took \nhim seriously and did our best to join him and passed legislation which \nwas historic because it established an obligation of local school \ndistricts across America to test children to make certain that they \nwere making progress. It also included some penalties for those schools \nthat were not making progress, for fear that children, after a number \nof years, would fall so far behind they would never have a chance. It \nreally created an incentive in one respect and a penalty in another \nrespect for those school districts where schools found children falling \nfurther and further behind.\n  There were those who said that this focus on testing was excessive. I \nshared their concerns but believed that it was an important element in \nbringing our schools to a national standard of excellence. And there \nwere those who said this is expensive. If you have a child who is \nstruggling to keep up with the class, that child needs extra attention \nand help. Tutoring, a helping hand, that child may need an afterschool \nprogram, a summer program, that child may need a personal mentor or \nteacher to help--all of those things were reasonable, but all of those \nthings were expensive.\n  The bill also said, we want to make certain the teacher standing in \nfront of the classroom is qualified to teach. If you hold yourself out \nas a math or science or foreign language teacher, you need to have a \nbackground. If you don't, the bill requires that these teachers go back \nto school, pick up the necessary college credits to indicate that they \ndeserve a certification in that specialty.\n  So overall, this is a bill which has a good goal and one I supported.\n  No Child Left Behind was a bargain between the Federal Government and \nthe school districts. We were going to provide resources to the school \ndistricts in exchange for reform, tough accountability provisions. And \nconsequences for failure were implemented.\n  In return, we pledged new investments of Federal money to pay for the \nneeded improvements. The Senate bill we are considering, this \nappropriations bill, is more than $6 billion short of meeting our end \nof the bargain under title I. We had a chance the other day when Robert \nByrd had an amendment saying let's keep our end of the bargain and \nprovide the $6 billion, and it was voted down.\n  So we have a mandate on school districts across America that is \nunfunded--unfunded to the tune of $6 billion. I have here a chart, \nwhich I will share with you, which Senator Byrd brought to the floor. \nIt shows, State by State, what each State will lose as a result of our \nfailure to fund No Child Left Behind as promised. Let's take one State, \nfor example.\n  In Nebraska, $24 million will be lost; money that was promised to \nthat State will not be coming for No Child Left Behind, but the \nmandates and requirements will be coming. There is a $255 million \nshortfall in my State of illinois. The total is $6 billion.\n  The Durbin-Schumer amendment that I am offering here prohibits the \nDepartment of Education from imposing penalties on schools for failing \nto meet the requirements of No Child Left Behind if we fail to fund it \nas promised. Schools should not be penalized for not meeting \nrequirements of this unfunded mandate. This amendment does not repeal \nor weaken the standards of No Child Left Behind. It does not affect \ntesting or measurement provisions. The tests will continue. So the \ntesting of students will continue. It provides schools with a 1-year \nrespite from corrective action when we fail to live up to our funding \ncommitment for title I. An identical amendment was supported a few \nweeks ago in the House by 195 members.\n  When No Child Left Behind was signed into law, we pledged $18.5 \nbillion to the States for this year to help them meet the tough \naccountability standards. Without the extra funding provided by the \nByrd amendment, which was defeated, we are going to miss that target by \n$6 billion. It means 6 million kids are being left behind by the Senate \nappropriation--by the failure of the Bush administration and this \nappropriation bill to keep our word.\n  In my State of Illinois, we are struggling with problems that many \nStates are facing. School districts across Illinois are laying off \nthousands of teachers and support staff. Class sizes of 40 students are \nfound in some schools. Salaries are being cut for other school \nemployees. The Chicago public schools closed down two schools for teen \nparents. Hamilton County closed two elementary schools. The \nCarpentersville suburban school district cut 140 teaching positions. \nElgin Unit School District 46, already operating with 600 fewer \nteachers because of cuts, will be forced to leave four recently built \nschools vacant for the entire school year because it cannot afford to \nstaff them. Middle-school students in Gurnie must now pay $145 to play \na team sport and $60 to join the band or choir.\n  In Pennsylvania, the Mill Creek school board cut 30 positions, \nincluding teachers, educational assistants, custodians, and athletic \nstaff. Yesterday the Pennsylvania State legislature announced an \neducation initiative funded at $610 million below the Governor's \nrequest. This leaves Pennsylvania's 501 school districts with just $53 \nmillion--roughly $105,000 per district--to help students meet the \nmandates of the Federal Government in No Child Left Behind.\n  The Philadelphia school district has had problems for years \nattracting qualified teachers. At the end of last week, there were 109 \nvacancies out of 12,000 teaching positions--up from 67 vacancies last \nweek. This increase in teacher vacancies in Philadelphia is a result of \nnew hires not showing up for class on the day they were due to start.\n\n  In Tennessee, Montgomery County schools are laying off 30 bus \ndrivers. Rhea County teachers, administrators, and parents pleaded with \nthe local board of education to rehire two school nurses. A Nashville \nelementary school principal, frustrated with the condition of 49 aging \nwindows at her school, smashed them herself in an attempt to force the \ndistrict to replace them.\n  In Massachusetts, the State is planning to eliminate tutorial \nassistance to students who fail its MCAS test--which is required for \ngraduation--on the first try. More than 100 districts are charging \nstudents a fee for school bus transportation, ranging from $25 to $850.\n  The list goes on. Of the most recent news reports of what school \ndistricts are facing and the reality across America, one that just came \nacross my desk I think is particularly troubling. It comes from \nFlorida. The headline is, ``Law Lets Students Forego Senior Year.'' It \nsays:\n\n       Of all the ways attempted to free up space in Florida's \n     crowded classrooms, this one could be a dream come true for \n     high schoolers in a hurry: a diploma without a senior year.\n       Supporters of a law granting a high school diploma in just \n     three years said it will help curb crowding in Florida's \n     schools.\n\n  This is the reality of the state of funding for education across \nAmerica.\n  For us to impose a mandate on school districts in Illinois, \nPennsylvania, Nebraska, Tennessee, Massachusetts, and New York and not \nprovide the funding is, frankly, to put additional financial burdens on \nthese school districts, which we are not paying for.\n  Frankly, I think there is a way to address this in a sensible \nfashion. If we are not going to provide 95 percent of the money we \npromised for No Child Left Behind, then we should suspend the penalties \nthat will be imposed on school districts under No Child Left Behind. \nThe testing goes on, and the accountability goes on. But to say to \nschool districts that they have to assume the responsibilities of \npaying the consequences of our failure to fund No Child Left Behind is \nfundamentally unfair.\n  No Child Left Behind provisions that would be suspended under this \namendment include mandatory transportation to other schools in the \ndistrict\n\n[[Page S11286]]\n\nfor students who wish to transfer--a very expensive undertaking, \nparticularly in large cities such as Philadelphia and Chicago; \nsupplemental tutoring, paid for by the district for students not \nmeeting State proficiency standards. We would like to see that, but we \nshould fund the bill as promised.\n  My colleagues should remember that Senator Dodd came to the floor, \nand his concern was that No Child Left Behind would not be adequately \nfunded. He offered a bipartisan amendment, which we adopted as a final \npart of the bill, which promised each and every year the exact amount \nof money we would appropriate for No Child Left Behind. This year we \nmissed that target by $6 billion.\n  My amendment would also suspend corrective action which could include \none or more of the following: replacing school staff, implementing new \ncurriculum, appointing an outside consultant, or extending the school \nday or year. Every one of these is a good idea. I voted for them. But \nwhy in the world would we impose that corrective action on a school \ndistrict and not provide them the resources to take care of it, to \nprovide the tutors and outside consultants?\n\n  We also would suspend the mandated restructuring or alternative \ngovernance, to reopen a school as a charter school, and replacing all \nor a majority of the school staff.\n  I am asking my colleagues to listen to the families, the parents, the \nschoolteachers, and administrators in their home States. You know what \nyou have heard. I have heard it as well. In school districts large and \nsmall, they believe in reform. They will accept accountability. But \nthey ask us for the resources to help. At a time when school districts \nacross America are struggling to keep the doors open, struggling to \nhire the teachers, crowding into classrooms because of State deficits \nand local property tax problems, how can we in Washington, in our \ninfinite wisdom, decide we are going to impose new standards and costs \non these school districts and not pay for them? That is what we are \ndoing.\n  This is clearly an unfunded mandate. Frankly, I think the Bush \nadministration and this Congress made a promise. Unfortunately, the \nPresident has not worked as ferociously for No Child Left Behind \nfunding as he has for other things, such as his tax-cut program. He has \nnot shown the same passion for providing school resources as he has for \nmany other elements of this budget.\n  Many of the people who now criticize this amendment claim the \nauthorized amounts for title I are not promises; they are just \nsuggestions. In many cases that is true, but it is not true on this \nbill.\n  The Dodd amendment puts specific authorization levels into place for \neach and every year--authorization levels we failed to meet with this \nbill's appropriation. We have never done that before in education \nbills. Traditionally, Congress only said we would appropriate such \namounts as may be necessary. The Dodd amendment locked in authorization \nlevels. In other words, we put those amounts in for a reason.\n  Not funding title I at the level we set is breaking our promise to \nschools and families and children across the country. The difference \nbetween what Congress agreed in 2001 it would cost to implement the \nreforms in No Child Left Behind and what has actually been delivered to \nschools is widening each year. If this bill passes, we are \nshortchanging schools across America by $6 billion, but we are sending \nthem the full cost of the mandate--unfunded mandates on local schools \nat the worst possible moment--in the midst of a national recession, \nwhen State budgets are unable to provide the resources they need. It is \nan unfunded mandate we should not be party to.\n  Many people have raised the question about the IDEA special education \nfunding. Well, would you suspend that mandate? I, frankly, hope we will \nvote--and I think the amendment will be offered shortly--to fully fund \nIDEA. That is a responsibility we should take on our shoulders. Many of \nus said we believe in it. This bill doesn't fund it properly. I think \nwe can.\n  The administration's approach to funding IDEA, incidentally, for \nschool districts across America is totally unrealistic.\n  We just are not going to be able to fund it if we follow the \nPresident's lead.\n  Since we cannot seem to find the money to pay for the reforms of No \nChild Left Behind, I am offering this amendment that will alleviate \nsome of the pressures for schools until we live up to our promises.\n  The amendment prevents the Department of Education from penalizing a \nschool for failing to meet the requirements of No Child Left Behind \nunless the authorized level of funding is provided. The mandate is yes \nif the funding is yes. No mandate, no funding.\n  I voted for this law. I want it to work. But just as funneling money \ninto failing schools without accountability is unacceptable, so is \nimposing new mandates without fully funding them.\n  The amendment does not repeal or weaken the standards contained in No \nChild Left Behind. It is not a retreat in the face of reform. Schools \nare serious about meeting their challenges, but they need the resources \nto make it work.\n  When I talk with these teachers working hard to prepare children for \nthis test, they tell me: Senator, I can do well with a lot of kids in \nmy class, but some of them need extra special attention. These are kids \nwho have been transferred just recently into our schools, kids with \nserious family problems, and kids who have had problems in their \nclasses last year.\n  These are situations which reflect the real world of classrooms \ntoday. Yet by not funding title I in State after State, we fall $6 \nbillion short of giving that teacher the resources he or she needs to \nbring that child up to the appropriate level of testing competence.\n  My amendment does not affect the testing or measurement provisions of \nNo Child Left Behind. It does not change the requirement that all \nteachers be highly qualified. My amendment would give schools a 1-year \nrespite from corrective action when we fail to live up to our funding. \nThe Democratic leader in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, \nspoke on the floor when they considered a similar amendment, which had \n198 votes in favor. She said:\n\n       This amendment presents the Chamber with a moment of truth \n     as to whether Congress is honest about its commitment to \n     education; whether or not it will honor its promise to \n     America's children contained in the No Child Left Behind Act.\n\n  We need to keep our word and demonstrate our commitment to reform not \njust by talking tough and imposing new standards, but by giving our \nschools and teachers the resources we promised, the resources we \nauthorized specifically for this year. When we fail to provide these \nschool districts those resources at this critical time, we are \nshortchanging education across America. We are saying our Federal \nbrilliance, when it comes to education, that led to these mandates, is \nmuch more compelling than the personal and local challenges which these \nschool districts are meeting every single day.\n  Whether I go to the rural areas of Illinois or the big city of \nChicago, I hear the same thing: Senator, it is a good idea. We will do \nour best to make it work. We are prepared to face the challenge of No \nChild Left Behind. But send us the resources you promised. Don't \nmandate this No Child Left Behind Program without the resources to make \nit work.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the amendment be stated by the clerk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin], for himself, Mr. \n     Schumer, and Mr. Dorgan, proposes an amendment numbered 1611 \n     to amendment No. 1542.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To prohibit funds appropriated in this Act from being used by \n the Department of Education to enforce any requirement under section \n   1116 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, or to \n implement penalties or sanctions under part A of title I of such Act, \n  if the amount appropriated to carry out such part A for fiscal year \n                   2004 is less than $18,500,000,000)\n\n       At the end of title III (relating to the Department of \n     Education), insert after the last section (preceding the \n     short title) the following:\n       Sec. __. None of the funds made available in this Act may \n     be used by the Department\n\n[[Page S11287]]\n\n     of Education to enforce any requirement under section 1116 of \n     part A of title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education \n     Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6316), or to implement any penalty or \n     sanction applicable to a State, a State educational agency, a \n     local educational agency, or a school under such part A, if \n     the amount appropriated in this Act for the purpose of \n     carrying out such part A for fiscal year 2004 is less than \n     $18,500,000,000, as authorized to be appropriated for such \n     purpose in section 1002(a) of the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6302(a)). Nothing in this \n     section shall be construed to prohibit a State, a State \n     educational agency, a local educational agency, or a school \n     from implementing the requirements of section 1116 of such \n     Act.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, do we have a time agreement on this \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Illinois yield to the \nSenator from Massachusetts?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am not asking the Senator to yield. When the Senator \nfrom Illinois finishes, I would like to get recognition in my own \nright.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois has 3 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I retain the reminder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, there is 20 minutes under the control of \nthe Senator from New Hampshire; am I correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield me 5 minutes?\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield to the Senator from Massachusetts such time as he \nneeds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, there is no one in this body who believes \nmore deeply than I do in necessity of full funding of the No Child Left \nBehind Act. I remember at the beginning of the debate on the No Child \nLeft Behind Act there were those who believed we were putting money \ninto communities without any direction and without accountability and, \ntherefore, we were not seeing results. And, there were those who \nbelieved strongly that we ought to have reform. The No Child Left \nBehind Act brought together both the reform and the resources.\n  I will continue to fight for increases in education resources, but \nthis amendment, I believe, moves this whole debate in the wrong \ndirection. Let me explain my view to the Members.\n  This amendment says:\n\n       None of the funds made available in this Act may be used by \n     the Department of Education to enforce any requirement under \n     section 1116 of part A. . . .\n\n  With what does section 1116(A) deal? It deals with new curriculum. It \ndeals with professional development. It deals with supplementary \nservices.\n  Let's just take those as an example. They would be emasculated by the \nDurbin amendment. If we read further back in the Durbin amendment on \npage 2, it says:\n\n       Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit a \n     State, a State educational agency, a local educational \n     agency, or a school from implementing the requirements of \n     section 1116 [of the No Child Left Behind Act].\n\n  This amendment makes education reform optional. It is not optional \ntoday. There is $12 billion in funding for the title I education \nprogram. What is not optional is that 10 percent of that will be used \nfor professional development; for training in struggling schools. The \nDurbin amendment eliminates that as a requirement, $1.2 billion out of \nthe $12 billion eliminated in teacher training. $12 billion overall is \nnot adequate for title I, but the Durbin amendment eliminates $1.2 \nbillion of that that is dedicated for better teachers. This amendment \nmakes that optional, means that it will just be there as a slush fund.\n  No. 2, the No Child Left Behind Act requires between 5 and 15 percent \nof title I funding be spent on supplementary services, afterschool \ninstruction. That is $600 million to $1.8 billion that is being spent \ntoday in supplementary services for the neediest children in this \ncountry. That is wiped out by the Durbin amendment--eliminated.\n  The Durbin amendment eliminates any requirement that we are going to \nhave teacher training under title I--not the other teacher training in \nthe other titles but teacher training under title I--which many believe \nis the most important training, because it is taking the title I \nteachers who are in the classrooms and providing the neediest children \nwith the instruction to upgrade their skills.\n  We talk about afterschool programs and the President failing to \nprovide for afterschool. The Durbin amendment is eliminating more of \nthat kind of protection. It is unbelievable to me--unbelievable to me.\n  Third, we have under title I, 5 to 15 percent--again, $600 million to \n$1.8 billion--that has to be used for upgrading curriculum and public \nschool choice. That was the essential part of the No Child Left Behind \nAct. Let States and local communities develop the curriculum, let well-\ntrained teachers teach the curriculum, provide new examinations to find \nout whether those children were being uplifted, and provide \nsupplementary services, which is extra tutoring for children who are \nbehind. Under the Durbin amendment, there is no assurance title I will \nbe used for these kinds of vital functions: Upgrading teacher \ncapability, upgrading the curriculum, and supplementary services. That \nis $2 billion or $3 billion out of the $12 billion. That, to me, is a \nslush fund.\n  I happen to be opposed to block grants. We have tried them, and they \ndid not work. Nonetheless, that is going to be the effect of this \namendment. Beyond that, it takes away the funding that exists in a \nsimilar way for public school choice that will be available even today.\n  Mr. President, I yield myself another 2 minutes.\n  That is why the Citizens Commission on Civil Rights opposes the \nDurbin amendment. That is why the Harvard Civil Rights Project, Chris \nEdley, is opposed to the Durbin amendment. That is why the Education \nTrust, which is a grassroots organization made up of minority parents, \nis strongly opposed to the Durbin amendment. We need to have this \nbattle and struggle. I differ with my friend and colleague, the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire, on the amounts and needs in the local schools and \nthe local community. I differ with him in terms of the national \npriorities in getting additional funds. Even though we differ in those \nareas, I agree with him that we cannot take a step backward now when we \nare beginning to see progress made in these areas.\n  The final point I would like to make is, I am proud that in my State \nof Massachusetts we have made very significant progress in the areas of \nacademic achievement and accomplishment. We basically started in a \nbipartisan way almost 10 years ago. We are tested now with what they \ncall the MCAS. It is a very strenuous kind of test, similar to the \nNational Assesment of Education Progress test, which is a very rigorous \nkind of test. After almost a 10-year period, what we have are the \nresults in Massachusetts. According to this recent Boston Globe \narticle, ``Scores show broad gains on MCAS. More Massachusetts high \nschool students passed the MCAS graduation test on their first attempt \nand scores climbed in every grade, every subject, and every racial \ngroup in statewide results released. About 75 percent of the class of \n2005, or 52,000 students, passed both English and math portions of the \n10th grade test. That was significantly better than the 69 percent of \nstudents in the class of 2004 and 68 percent of the students in 2003.''\n  I will not take the time of the Senate to go into every kind of \nsubgroup by ethnicity, but Black, Latino, White, with disabilities, \nlimited English proficiency, regular education--the whole group has \nmoved up. That is because the State has effectively embraced the \nidentical kinds of requirements that are in the No Child Left Behind \nAct.\n  The Durbin amendment steps us back from that kind of a commitment. We \nought to commit ourselves to the long road. We ought to get the \nresources that are necessary. I believe the Durbin amendment is an \nabdication of this institution to meet our responsibilities to ensure \nthat there is going to be an investment, even with the money we have, \nin a way that makes a difference in terms of children's lives.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n[[Page S11288]]\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask the status of the remaining time \nbetween the parties.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has 11 minutes, \n50 seconds remaining. The Senator from Illinois has 3\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I begin by congratulating the Senator from \nMassachusetts for an excellent statement. I agree with 90 percent of \nwhat he has said. He is absolutely on the mark relative to what is \nhappening in No Child Left Behind. Progress is occurring.\n  We still have a debate, obviously, as to what the proper level of \nfunding is, but this bill was passed not as an issue of money but as an \nissue of looking at the low-income child and recognizing that for \ngeneration after generation we have left this child behind in our \nschool systems. We said enough is enough.\n  Under Senator Kennedy's leadership, and under President Bush's \nleadership, we said it is time to say to the low-income child that when \nthey finish their education, when they step out of that classroom that \nfinal day when they graduate, they are going to be able to compete for \nthe American dream because they are going to learn what they are \nsupposed to learn, they are going to learn what they need to learn. It \nwas a commitment we made as a Congress and as a country, and it was the \nright commitment.\n  Now we have this type of amendment come forward, which is essentially \nan attempt to put a stake through the heart of the essence of how \nparents can figure out how to help their low-income children who are in \nthese school systems.\n  This amendment would have the practical effect of basically \neliminating the options which parents get under the No Child Left \nBehind Act to give their child a better shot at the American dream. We \nare talking about parents of low-income kids, by the way.\n  Supplemental services, what is that? Well, it is one of those terms \nthat is a big word. It is a confusing word. What it means is if someone \nis a parent of a low-income child and their child is in a school that \nis not working, that has not worked year after year, that has turned \nout kids who have not been able to compete year after year, we are \ngoing to give them the chance, as a parent, to take their child after \nschool, or maybe even during the schoolday if the school decides to \nstructure it that way, to get some remedial support in reading, \nremedial support in math, things which will catch that child up so they \nare no longer left behind.\n  The only way they are going to get some of these third and fourth \ngraders, who come into the school system undernourished, up to speed is \nto give them this tutorial support. That is what this amendment would \nkill. It would kill the opportunity of a parent who has a child in a \npublic school system, who knows that the public school next door or \ndown the road is doing a better job with kids like her kids, who knows \nthat if her child stays in the school in which they are presently \nenrolled, that child is simply never going to catch up, but knows if \nthey can take them down the road a little way to another public school, \nthat child will have a chance at the American dream because they will \nbe taught what they need to know. It would kill the opportunity of that \nparent to accomplish that. That is an inexcusable act, in my opinion, \nof denying parents of low-income kids the opportunity to do something \nabout their children's right to a decent education.\n\n  The No Child Left Behind Act has, unfortunately, gotten caught up in \na lot of crosscurrents that deal mostly with the funding fight. There \nis also an undercurrent of resistance from some of our professional \ncommunity that just does not want to be held accountable.\n  Unfortunately, what has happened over the years is that we have never \nhad a system where parents really could find out what was happening to \ntheir children, especially low-income kids. They knew something was \nwrong because there was produced child after child who could not \ncompete in our society, but they could never find out what was wrong.\n  Well, No Child Left Behind creates an atmosphere and a system which, \nremember, is designed by the local school system--this is not a top-\ndown system. The Federal Government does not set the testing standards. \nThe Federal Government does not set the hurdles. It is set by the local \nschool systems. When those local school systems set their standards for \ntesting as to what a child in the third or fourth grade should know, at \nthat point that information becomes public. The parent gets an \nopportunity to see it and find out what is happening to their child in \nthat school, and if they discover that their child is in a school that \nyear after year has failed to get their children to the level of \nability that has been set as the level by that school system, by that \ncommunity, of ability that a child should have at that grade level, \nthen the parent has the right to do something to correct it.\n  Under this bill, we have empowered the parent with tutorial support, \nwith public school choice, both of which would be killed under this \nproposal, as would, as the Senator from Massachusetts so appropriately \npointed out, the funding for those programmatic initiatives which are \ndirected right at the low-income teaching community. Those teachers who \nhave a high number of low-income kids in their school systems need some \nspecial skills in many cases to deal with those kids, especially \nlanguage skills. This amendment would eliminate the ability to fund \nthose programs.\n  I will touch base also on this whole question of, is there adequate \nfunding? Let me point out that this amendment is justified on the \ngrounds that Illinois is not getting enough money under No Child Left \nBehind. That can be debated. But the fact is, Illinois is getting 36 \npercent more in dollars under No Child Left Behind for title I funding, \nas a result of No Child Left Behind, than it would have gotten if we \nhad continued under the old law. They have received $813 million in \n2003. They received $813 million. This was $213 million more than what \nthey would have received under the old law.\n\n  In fact, they have received so much money under No Child Left Behind, \nit is really a prefunded event. It is not an unfunded mandate. They \nhave been receiving so much money that has been flowing into Illinois. \nUnder No Child Left Behind, there is presently $312 million of title I \nfunds which is unspent as of the end of the year 2002. It has not been \ndrawn down by the school systems yet in Illinois.\n  But that gets into the funding debate, which is really another \ndebate, not this debate. Debate about this amendment is about whether \nor not you are going to eviscerate the basic purpose of the No Child \nLeft Behind law, which was to give low-income kids an opportunity to \nlearn at the level of their peers; and if they were not learning at the \nlevel of their peers because their school systems were not delivering \nthe educational standards they needed, then to give their parents some \noptions to try to get them up to speed through tutorial choice or \npublic school choice.\n  So I join my colleague from Massachusetts in strongly opposing this \namendment and hope other Members will join us. I reserve the remainder \nof the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois has 3 minutes 30 \nseconds remaining.\n  Mr. DURBIN. And the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has 4 minutes \n45 seconds.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I just listened to the passionate \ncommitment of the Senator from New Hampshire to No Child Left Behind, \nand it is no surprise. When he made the same speech on the floor on \nbehalf of the legislation, it was so compelling, I joined him and voted \nfor it. But I wonder, where was that passionate commitment to No Child \nLeft Behind when Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia offered an amendment \nyesterday to pay for it?\n  Here is the rollcall. With the exception of my friend and colleague \nfrom Massachusetts, those who were giving these passionate speeches \nabout No Child Left Behind had a chance yesterday to pay for it and \nrefused to do so. They refused to put the money down to pay for this \ngreat, new idea, this new Federal mandate.\n  Lest you believe this is just an issue in Chicago, IL, in a place \ncalled Concord, NH, on August 18 they released the State budget. They \nhave a problem.\n\n[[Page S11289]]\n\nThe budget contains $1 in each--$1 in each--of the next 2 years for \nState assessment tests. If the money is not found, and soon, to pay for \nthe next round of tests, the schools that are on the failing schools \nlist cannot get off it.\n  It tells me that New Hampshire and Nebraska, like Illinois, like \nMassachusetts, and every State, are struggling to come up with \nresources for education.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. No, I will not. You have your own time.\n  If we had voted for the Byrd amendment, $19 million would have gone \nto the State of New Hampshire. If we had joined Senator Kennedy voting \nfor it, the Massachusetts allocation would have been $129, and $250 \nmillion from my own State. So let me say to those passionately \ncommitted to No Child Left Behind today, where were you yesterday? \nWhere were you on the Byrd amendment when you could have put the money \nwe promised into the bill?\n\n  To my friend Senator Kennedy, it is indeed painful. It was \nunthinkable, when I ran for the Senate, that I would be in this \nposition of debating him on an education issue, but we do disagree.\n  What I am eliminating is the mandate. Each and every school district \nin his State and my State can use the Federal funds for tutoring, for \nteacher quality, for afterschool. The funds that are available can be \nused. But the mandate is removed until we put an adequate amount of \nmoney on the table.\n  Regarding his State of Massachusetts, he speaks about the MCAS score, \nand he is proud of it. Yet the most recent report is this out of \nMassachusetts. The State is planning to eliminate tutorial assistance \nto students who fail the MCAS test, which is required for graduation, \non their first try. Massachusetts, as good a story as there is to be \ntold, is struggling, like the State of Louisiana and the State of \nNebraska and the State of New Hampshire and the State of Illinois. Yet \nour mandates continue.\n  When I asked the head of the Chicago Public Schools System, his \nposition on it, he said:\n\n       I am prepared to implement No Child Left Behind. I am happy \n     to do it. But send me the resources to get it done.\n\n  And let me quote from a speech he recently gave in Chicago--Arne \nDuncan, head of Chicago Public Schools:\n\n       I would much rather invest Federal dollars in tutoring \n     struggling students than transporting students outside their \n     neighborhood. I would much rather invest Federal dollars for \n     new schools and buy more buildings and help our teachers and \n     our principals become better educators.\n\n  What this professional educator is saying to us is: For goodness' \nsake, if you are not going to fund the Federal mandate, don't impose it \non us. Let us respond to the emergencies we face every single day.\n  I urge our colleagues to listen to their educators at home and \nsupport the amendment today.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  I have difficulty in following the logic of the Senator from Illinois \nsaying, look, Massachusetts is eliminating the supplementary services \nand, therefore, this is a crisis situation.\n  I want to get additional funds. But make no mistake about it. We have \nsection 1116 here. This is what his amendment does; it effectively \nsuspends 1116. That is taking, out of the $12 billion we have in title \nI, $1.2 billion out of required teacher training.\n  You can say the States might still do it or local communities. We say \nit is important enough that, of the $12 billion, at least 10 percent \nhas to be provided for that. We are saying between 5 percent and 15 \npercent is going to have to be spent in supplementary services--\nrequired.\n  Not under the Durbin amendment. We require that. You vote for the \nDurbin amendment and you are eliminating the requirement of $1.2 \nbillion of required services today, that is required under that act, \nunder the Durbin amendment.\n  Under the existing 1116, there are requirements for the development \nof new curriculum. That is eliminated. Under the Durbin amendment, you \nare going to get $3 billion, what I call a slush fund. Senator Durbin \nsays local people can make up their minds and do a good job. We had \nthat battle. We know what works. We know you need well-trained \nteachers. That is what 1116 provides. We know you need supplementary \nservices. That is what 1116 provides. We know you need the new \ncurriculum reform, and that is what 1116 provides.\n\n  At the end of his amendment, he says: Look, at the end of the day, if \nthe State wants to, they can--nothing in this section is to be \nconstrued to prohibit a State.\n  As one who is committed to this, I don't want to see less money \ncommitted to training teachers in struggling schools; I want to see \nmore. The Durbin amendment will mean less. I don't want to see less \nassistance for supplementary services; I want to see more. Under the \nDurbin amendment, you will get less.\n  The list goes on. Could I have 20 seconds?\n  Section 1116 is the heart and soul, in terms of the educational \nreforms. That is why there is such strong support from the civil rights \ncommunity. I have listed the organizations in the civil rights \ncommunity that take strong exception, who agree with the Senator from \nNew Hampshire and myself and believe it is better to have these \nresources committed to the neediest and poorest children, rather than \njust giving a slush fund to the community.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has 2 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, again, I join with the Senator from \nMassachusetts, agreeing with his comments. I want to go beyond that \nbecause the Senator from Illinois has unfortunately misrepresented the \nfacts in New Hampshire. I hoped he would take a question on his time \nsince he used his time to misrepresent the facts, but since he did not, \nI will try to correct the Senator from Illinois as to the facts in New \nHampshire.\n  Yes, the State budget did zero out the assessment money, but that has \nnothing to do with this amendment. In fact, just the opposite. Under \nthe No Child Left Behind bill, the average cost of developing tests in \nNew Hampshire is $300,000. Under No Child Left Behind, the State of New \nHampshire receives $500,000 for every test it develops, at the various \ngrade levels. So the State actually makes $200,000, and the legislature \nfigured this out. That is why they zeroed it out, because they \nrealized, instead of an unfunded mandate, what they were getting was \nmore money than they needed to fund the test, and they intended to use \nthat money to fund other parts of the State budget, and right now that \nis what the fight is about in New Hampshire. It has nothing to do with \nunfunded mandates.\n  The Senator from Illinois, in his desire to bring New Hampshire into \nthe debate, appears to have misunderstood the position in New \nHampshire, and he misunderstood the entire issue also, because if his \nposition is that he is going to help the children of low-income parents \nin this country with his amendment, he is absolutely wrong, because he \nis taking away with his amendment the tools that the parents of those \nchildren need, tools such as tutorial services, tools such as public \nschool choice, tools such as having teachers of title I students who \nunderstand the special needs of title I students be trained properly. \nHe is taking away those tools with this amendment.\n  I certainly hope my colleagues in the Senate will join me and Senator \nKennedy, who has spent so many years on this issue, in voting down this \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, do I have any time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has no time remaining.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I think we are ready to proceed with the \namendment by the Senator from Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, may we go to the Senator from Illinois \nfor his amendment now?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: My understanding \nwas the order would be that the Senator from Illinois would proceed, \nthen myself, and then the Senator from Louisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is correct.\n\n[[Page S11290]]\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Nevada.\n  Mr. President, what is the time allocation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you very much.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1613 To Amendment No. 1542\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the amendment which I am offering, with \nSenator Kennedy now having joined forces with me as well as Senator \nEdwards and others in support, is an effort to provide money for \nteacher quality in the No Child Left Behind Act; that is; to fund the \nFederal mandate.\n  This bill cuts teacher quality grants by $84 million, eliminating \ntraining for 20,000 teachers nationwide. The No Child Left Behind Act \nraises the standard for students and requires school districts to close \nthe achievement gap between minority and nonminority students. It also \nraises standards for teachers, mandating that all teachers are highly \nqualified by the end of the 2005-2006 school year.\n  Research shows that teacher effectiveness is the single most \nimportant factor that influences student achievement. It is more \nimportant than the income of the student's family, for cumulative \nexpenditures or any other investment in the classroom.\n  Students assigned to high-quality teachers can gain a full grade \nlevel of achievement of students over students in ineffective classes. \nNine out of 10 Americans believe that improving teaching is the most \nimportant strategy for improving schools. Recent research links student \nlearning to having licensed teachers.\n  Researchers in Arizona State found that students with certified \nteachers perform 20 percent better than assessments of those with \nnoncertified.\n  A study at Stanford found that States such as North Carolina, \nMinnesota, Iowa, North Dakota, Wisconsin, and Maine that have \ncomplement student achievement standards and investment in teacher \nquality have higher achievement in reading and math.\n  The list goes on and on.\n  What we are saying with this amendment is that we need to find the \nresources that we promised under the No Child Left Behind Act.\n  This amendment is going to provide greater teacher quality and \ntraining that will help these students across America reach their \npotential because they have competent and qualified teachers in the \nclassroom.\n  I hope my colleagues here who have had second thoughts about whether \nthey want to fund the No Child Left Behind Act will not have second \nthoughts when it comes to teacher quality. Let us provide the resources \nthat are necessary to make the No Child Left Behind Act work and allow \nteachers to have the competence in the classroom to succeed.\n  I withhold the remainder of my time and yield to the Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, there is no doubt about the desirability \nof teacher quality programs and training. We currently have in \neducation professional development $3.378 billion. This is \nsubstantially more than the President's request.\n  Again, I would like to have more funds available from the budget \nresolution and the allocation, but we simply do not have it.\n  Mr. President, how much time does the Senator from Illinois have \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes thirty-eight seconds.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I am prepared to yield back my time. We are running on a \nvery tough time schedule trying to finish this bill today. If the \nSenator from Illinois has nothing further to say--\n  Mr. DURBIN. I have very brief remarks and then I will conclude.\n  Let me make sure we understand exactly what this amendment does. I \nhave spoken to the issue of teacher quality. There is $325 million in \nState grants for that purpose. I think this shows an increase in the \nteacher quality commitment which is important for us to make sure the \nNo Child Left Behind Act succeeds. There is another $2 million for \ntraining teachers in technology.\n  How many times have we visited the classroom as Senators and found \nolder teachers such as myself in age struggling to understand the new \ntechnology? The bill before us zeros that out. There is no money for \npreparing our teachers to use technology. This amendment adds $62 \nmillion, and $50 million for training teachers in math and science. It \nincreases the investment by $50 million to a total of $150 million.\n  I think this is an extremely high priority when you consider the \ntechnical challenges facing us in this century. Finally, there is $12.1 \nmillion for school leadership which helps to recruit, train, and retain \nprincipals and assistant principals. These are the people who have the \nresponsibility to make the school work.\n  I think this $450 million is money well spent--money that lets the No \nChild Left Behind Act have a chance to succeed. To shortchange it, \nunfortunately, will cause us to fall short of our promise and fall \nshort of the mark in improving education across America.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). Does the Senator offer his \namendment?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Of course. I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin], for himself, Mr. \n     Kennedy, Mr. Edwards, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Lautenberg, and Mr. \n     Corzine, proposes an amendment numbered 1613 to amendment No. \n     1542.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide additional funding for teacher quality programs \nunder the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 and the Higher \nEducation Act of 1965 and for the Mathematics and Science Partnerships \n and the school leadership program under the Elementary and Secondary \n                         Education Act of 1965)\n\n       On page 36, line 16, strike the period at the end and \n     insert ``: Provided further, That of the funds appropriated \n     in this Act for the National Institutes of Health, \n     $85,000,000 shall not be available for obligation until \n     September 30, 2004: Provided further, That in addition to \n     amounts otherwise appropriated under this Act for grants to \n     States under part A of title II of the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6601 et seq.), \n     there are appropriated an additional $325,000,000 for such \n     grants: Provided further, That in addition to amounts \n     otherwise appropriated under this Act for the Preparing \n     Tomorrow's Teachers to Use Technology Program under part B of \n     title II of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1041 \n     et seq.), there are appropriated an additional $62,094,000 \n     for such program: Provided further, That in addition to \n     amounts otherwise appropriated under this Act for the \n     Mathematics and Science Partnerships program under part B of \n     title II of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of \n     1965 (20 U.S.C. 6661 et seq.), there are appropriated an \n     additional $50,000,000 for such program: Provided further, \n     That in addition to amounts otherwise appropriated under this \n     Act for the school leadership program under section 2151(b) \n     of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 \n     U.S.C. 6651(b)), there are appropriated an additional \n     $12,500,000 for such program: Provided further, That the \n     amount $6,895,199,000 in section 305(a)(1) of this Act shall \n     be deemed to be $7,344,793,000: Provided further, That the \n     amount $6,783,301,000 in section 305(a)(2) of this Act shall \n     be deemed to be $6,333,707,000.''.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, there is no doubt about the quality or \npriority of what the Senator from Illinois has offered. We have $3.378 \nin funding for educational professional development. I submit that this \nis adequate, and is certainly all we can do within the budget \nresolution.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this chart be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S11291]]\n\n\n\n                                     LABOR-HHS-EDUCATION APPROPRIATION BILL\n                      [Resources Available Primarily for Educator Professional Development]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                               FY03\n                    Programs                     FY04 Senate      FY04      conference      FY02         FY01\n                                                                request       rept.      comparable   comparable\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nState Grants for Improving Teacher Quality.....   $2,850,000   $2,850,000   $2,930,825   $2,850,000   $2,108,000\nAdvanced Credentialing.........................        9,935  ...........        9,935       10,000        18500\nEarly Childhood Educator Professional                 14,902       15,000       14,902       15,000       10,000\n Development...................................\nMath and Science Partnerships..................      100,344       12,500      100,344       12,500  ...........\nTroops to Teachers.............................  ...........       25,000       28,812       18,000  ...........\nTransition to Teaching.........................       41,727       49,400       41,727       35,000       31,000\nPreparing Tomorrow's Teachers to Use Technology  ...........  ...........       62,094       62,500      125,000\nNational Writing Project.......................       18,890  ...........       16,890       14,000       10,000\nCivic Education................................       28,812       27,000       28,812       27,000       21,000\nTeaching of Traditional American History.......      120,000      100,000       99,350      100,000       50,000\nSpecial Education Personnel Preparation........       91,899       90,000       91,899       90,000       81,952\nTeacher Quality Enhancement....................       89,415       90,000       89,415       90,000       98,000\nSchool Leadership..............................       12,419  ...........       12,419       10,000            0\n                                                ----------------------------------------------------------------\n      Total....................................    3,378,343    3,258,900    3,527,424    3,334,000    2,553,452\n        Percent................................         32.3  ...........           38  ...........  ...........\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote: Programs listed above specifically support professional development activities for educators.

Madam President, I yield the remainder of my time so we \ncan proceed to the amendment by the Senator from Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1585 To Amendment No. 1542\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, I ask that the pending amendment which \nis currently before the Senate be temporarily set aside, and I call up \namendment No. 1585.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Ensign] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1585 to amendment No. 1542.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide an additional $100,000,000 to carry out the 21st \nCentury Community Learning Centers Program under part B of title IV of \n          the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965)\n\n       At the end of title III, insert the following:\n       Sec. __. (a) The total amount appropriated, out of any \n     money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated for fiscal \n     year 2004, to carry out the 21st Century Community Learning \n     Centers Program under part B of title IV of the Elementary \n     and Secondary Education Act of 1965, shall be $1,100,000,000.\n       (b) Each amount appropriated under this Act (other than \n     amounts appropriated for the Department of Education) that is \n     not required to be appropriated by a provision of law is \n     reduced by the uniform percentage necessary to reduce the \n     total amounts appropriated under this Act (other than amounts \n     appropriated for the Department of Education) by \n     $100,000,000.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, this amendment would increase funding \nfor the 21st Century Community Learning Centers program by $100 \nmillion.\n  This amendment does not bust the budget or cut any other education \nprogram in the budget. Rather, the amendment requires an across the \nboard cut in every other title of this appropriations bill. This \ncalculates to a point zero-zero-one-two-percent across the board cut.\n  I am committed to ensuring that our schools have the assistance they \nneed to make certain that our children leave the education systems as \nwell-rounded individuals.\n  The 21st Century Community Learning Centers in Nevada, and across the \ncountry, work to create well-rounded individuals by partnering with \ngroups such as local YMCAs, local children's museums, the Girl Scouts, \nBoys and Girls Clubs, and in Nevada, the City of Las Vegas, the \nUniversity of Nevada, the Clark County Health District, the Nevada \nYouth Alliance, and America's Promise, just to name a few.\n  Last year 2,780 new applicants requested over $1.9 billion from this \nprogram. Only 308 applications received approval and funding totaling \n$206 million.\n  Currently in Nevada there are 6,750 children receiving services from \na 21st Century Community Learning Center in their neighborhood. \nHowever, there are currently over 75,000 students eligible for this \nprogram in Nevada alone.\n  The benefits of this program should go without saying. Not only do \nchildren enrolled in these programs improve academically, but are also \nless likely to become caught up in the juvenile justice system.\n  Accordinig to the Department of Education, children who regularly \nattend high quality after-school programs have better peer relations \nand emotional adjustment, better grades and conduct in school, more \nacademic and enrichment opportunities, spend less time watching \ntelevision, and have lower incidences of drug use, violence, and \npregnancy.\n  This makes sense considering that studies by the FBI have found that \nthe peak hours for juvenile crime and victimization are the hours after \nschool and before parents get home from work.\n  These important programs not only give students a place to go after \nschool, but use that time to give students assistance with their \nhomework, provide additional English lessons to students who do not use \nEnglish has their first language, and give these kids a safe place to \ninteract with their peers.\n  I ask my colleagues to not give up on the thousands of children \nacross America who may need a little extra help to succeed in school \nand support this amendment.\n  Senator Boxer offered an amendment earlier on the very program on \nwhich I am offering an amendment. Her amendment was for a larger \nincrease in the afterschool program but her amendment was not offset. I \ntotally support what she is trying to do. I believe very strongly in \nafterschool programs.\n  I am offering a $100 million increase in the afterschool programs \ncompared to what is currently in the bill. I know that the chairman has \nworked hard and has tried to get as much funding as he can. But as \nsomebody who grew up in a situation as a latchkey kid, afterschool \nprograms would have been very helpful to me. There are many, many \nchildren out there today who need afterschool programs to keep them out \nof the improper type of behavior that kids can engage in these days. It \nis cheaper to invest in these children in these afterschool programs \nthan it is to spend the money when they get into trouble in the \njuvenile halls and some of them end up going to prison. These are \nwonderful programs.\n  I ask our colleagues to consider this amendment. I know we are trying \nto stay within the budget. Ours does. It shifts some funding from one \nplace to another so we can provide this extra funding to get more kids \ninto the afterschool programs.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, there is no doubt about the value of \nthe afterschool programs. That has been recognized by the subcommittee \nand we have put $1 billion in the program. This is $400 million more \nthan the President's request. Would we like to have additional funds? \nCertainly we would, but we simply don't have it within our allocation.\n\n[[Page S11292]]\n\n  The amendment offered by the Senator from Nevada with an across-the-\nboard cut would cut into many very important programs. There will be \nfewer youth employment training centers, fewer NIH grants, fewer \ndislocated worker trainees, fewer kids in Head Start, and fewer kids in \nchild care.\n  In the interest of time, I ask unanimous consent that this chart be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       The Ensign amendment has an across-the-board cut of \n     $100,000,000 (.0012%) to all programs except Education. This \n     would mean a cut of: -$1,201,000 (470 fewer youth Employment \n     Training jobs); -$1,080,000 (600 fewer Adult Training jobs); \n     -$1,718,000 (1,000 fewer Dislocated Worker trainees); \n     -$33,579,000 (100 fewer NIH grants); -$2,165,000 (1,000 fewer \n     people receive substance abuse treatment); -$526,000 (300 \n     fewer people receiving mental health services); -$8,179,000 \n     (1,200 fewer kids in Head Start); -$2,520,000 (600 fewer kids \n     in child care); -$685,000 (400,000 fewer meals served to \n     seniors); and -$10,236,000 (6,500 fewer Social Security \n     disability claims processed).\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, we have structured this bill very \ncarefully and crafted it very carefully. While I appreciate the \ninterest of the Senator from Nevada, if we restructure it with these \nacross-the-board cuts, we will be digging into a lot of vital programs \nwhich the subcommittee and the committee have carefully considered and \ncrafted on what we think is balanced.\n\n  I yield back the remainder of my time so we can move to the amendment \nof the Senator from Louisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1614 to Amendment No. 1542\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Ms. Landrieu] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1614 to amendment No. 1542.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To provide additional funds for programs relating to West \n  Nile Virus and to fund the Mosquito Abatement for Safety and Health \n                                  Act)\n\n       On page 61, between lines 14 and 15, insert the following:\n       Sec. __. (a) In General.--In addition to amounts otherwise \n     appropriated under this Act for programs relating to West \n     Nile Virus, there are appropriated an additional $25,000,000 \n     for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to fund \n     such programs, of which $1,250,000 shall be set aside for \n     Indian tribes and tribal organizations, and there are \n     appropriated an additional $100,000,000 for the Centers for \n     Disease Control and Prevention to fund programs under the \n     Mosquito Abatement for Safety and Health Act (Public Law 108-\n     75), of which $5,000,000 shall be set aside for Indian tribes \n     and tribal organizations.\n       (b) Offset.--Of the funds appropriated under this Act for \n     the National Institutes of Health, $145,000,000 shall not be \n     available for obligation until September 30, 2004. The amount \n     $6,895,199,000 in section 305(a)(1) of this Act shall be \n     deemed to be $7,020,199,000, and the amount $6,783,301,000 in \n     section 305(a)(2) of this Act shall be deemed to be \n     $6,658,301,000.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, we have had a series of very important \namendments. The priorities of Members and their States are reflected in \neach amendment that has been offered, and the amendments of Senator \nBreaux, one of the cosponsors, Senator Daschle, Senator Johnson, and \nothers, is the same. This is a very important issue to our State and an \nissue we hope we can find some redress to in this appropriations bill.\n  My amendment seeks to fund a new piece of legislation passed last \nyear with a great deal of fanfare because the situation is so obvious \nrelating to the West Nile virus sweeping the United States.\n  Because of this very frightening situation, the Congress acted \nappropriately last year. Several Members joined together with States \nthat had been very hard hit to pass a new piece of Federal legislation \nsaying yes, the Federal Government should step to the plate and help \nour States with treatment, with education for the population, with \nprevention, and also with methods in place to basically kill the \nmosquitoes and kill the dangerous larvae that create the situation.\n  There are a lot of serious issues. I don't mean to compare this in \nany way with the degree of the heartbreak in which we engage in the war \nin Iraq because that is such an international and extremely important \nissue. Just to let the taxpayers know, to date we had 286 people die in \na war; we have had 246 people die in the United States of West Nile \nvirus. The small, modest amendment I am offering, which is only $100 \nmillion, to fully fund this program makes small grants available to the \nStates. This would help save lives, would help the country become more \naware of what individuals and communities can do to protect themselves. \nHopefully, with just a little bit of help from the Federal Government, \nour States will step to the plate.\n  In 2002, we had 884 cases reported in Illinois. In that State alone, \n64 people have died. In Michigan, we have had 614 positive cases of \nWest Nile and 51 people died as a result. My State has been hard hit. \nIn Louisiana we had 329 cases in 2002 and 25 deaths. Other States that \nhave registered high numbers of cases are Colorado, South Dakota, and \nLouisiana for 2003. Mosquitos are not a new enemy in Louisiana. As a \nlow-lying swampy place, we have been battling this for literally \nhundreds of years. However, they are more than a nuisance; they are \ndeadly. This is a very serious public health issue in the United \nStates.\n  The bill last year was passed with great fanfare, authorizing a very \nsimple, modest, but important Federal program to help give moneys to \nlocal counties--in our State that would be parishes--to help with \nmosquito abatement programs. It requires a local government match. \nWithout this money there will be no assistance for the State and local \ngovernments to help with the West Nile virus and mosquito control. This \nfunding will make it possible for State and local jurisdictions to \ndevelop and implement effective programs. I am proud to say Louisiana \nhas been a leader. Of course, for 300 years we have been fighting \nmosquitos. We have a lot of experience. Many of the coastal States, \nincluding North Carolina, have experienced difficulties, as well as \nAlaska, I understand. It is interesting to note that it is not limited \nto just the coastal States.\n  Again, the highest incidence is in Illinois, Michigan, and Ohio. \nPeople are dying. This can be a fatal condition.\n  Madam President, my amendment seeks to fund the new but very \nimportant program to help local governments deal with the West Nile \nvirus. I hope we find the resources in this budget to do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I will use a couple of minutes of \nleader time to compliment the distinguished Senator from Louisiana for \nher amendment. I am pleased to be a cosponsor. This is a particularly \ndifficult problem for many in the Upper Midwest. We now have more than \n500 South Dakotans infected by West Nile and seven people have died. \nLast week 41 cases were reported in 1 day in our State. That we had \nonly 37 cases last year versus over 500 is a sign of the dramatic \nincrease in the problem we are now experiencing. This is a very serious \nhealth issue. Tribal populations, in particular, in South Dakota are \nconcerned about accessing the West Nile funding that is available. This \namendment contains a tribal set-aside which will help them to access \nthe funds directly from the CDC.\n  While the problem is particularly acute in South Dakota right now, \nWest Nile virus, as the Senator from Louisiana has pointed out, is a \nnational problem. Over 4,150 cases across the country have now been \nidentified, and nationwide more than 280 people have already died.\n  This situation is a national issue that deserves far more national \nattention than the CDC has been able to give it so far. That is why the \namendment is so critical and that is why I am hopeful that, on a \nbipartisan basis, we can support it this afternoon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I join my colleagues Senators \nLandrieu and Daschle in offering this West Nile Virus amendment to the \nLabor-HHS appropriations bill. As many of you know, West Nile Virus has \nreturned\n\n[[Page S11293]]\n\nthis mosquito season and has already impacted numerous states. \nParticularly hard hit this year have been Colorado, Nebraska, Wyoming \nand my home State of South Dakota. Last year, South Dakota only \nexperienced 37 human cases of West Nile, and this year that number has \nalready risen to 583 cases and 7 deaths, representing the highest per \ncapita rate in the Nation.\n  It is hard to believe that just a few short years ago West Nile Virus \nhad never even been heard of in this country, and this year the total \ncase count has climbed to almost 3000 and took the lives of many. In \njust one year we learned that this illness could be transmitted not \nonly by mosquitoes, but through blood, tissues and even breast milk. \nOur recent experiences with this illness and Severe Acute Respiratory \nSyndrome are just two examples that should make us aware of how \ncritical it is that we be prepared to respond swiftly and effectively \nto newly emerging infectious disease threats that now face our country \nand our friends across the globe.\n  Over the last month, I have met with experts on this issue in South \nDakota, as well as CDC Director Dr. Julie Gerberding to try and get a \nbetter handle on what is happening in my State and across the Nation \nregarding this virus. What I have heard from the experts in South \nDakota is that our cities and counties are woefully underfunded and \nill-equipped to handle the pressing needs to get information to the \npublic and protect the public health from this threat. Community \nunderstanding of the virus and how to combat it at the local level is \nminimal, and State and Federal support is sorely needed.\n  I have also heard from people in Indian Country who have said that \nfear is rampant on the reservations and that there is virtually no \nmoney for public education and even less for mosquito abatement. Our \nState lab capacity is fairly good, but turnaround time on tests takes \nseveral days and the lab is not open 24 hours, 7 days a week. The \nmedical community has indicated that less than optimal lab testing \ncapabilities for West Nile has resulted in doctors ordering unnecessary \nand costly tests and treatments.\n  For these reasons, it is important that we fund not only the newly \nenacted Mosquito Abatement for Safety and Health or MASH Act, which \nwill provide local communities with funds for mosquito abatement, but \nalso provide CDC with additional funding under its existing authorities \nfor other public health activities in 2004. In South Dakota and I \nimagine in other States, health departments, public health \nprofessionals and the provider community are doing everything they can \nto prevent and control this illness with resources available. However, \nwe can do better to help them improve public health infrastructure, \npublic education and increased lab capacities, which all mean better \nWest Nile prevention, surveillance and detection of an illness that has \nchallenged South Dakota's public health system and others around the \nNation.\n  Investing in these types of activities will allow us to prepare for \nnext year, when States like mine may experience an even worse outbreak \nof the virus in South Dakota. In my discussions with Dr. Gerberding \nlast week, she indicated that experts believe that the virus will move \nWest, and has the potential to hit larger communities in California and \nacross the coast, which could present an even greater public health \nchallenge than what we have experienced in South Dakota this year.\n  I thank Senators Landrieu and Daschle for their work on this \namendment which will provide $100 million to fund the MASH Act, which \ndid not receive any funding in the President's budget nor in the \ncurrent bill on the floor. This amendment will also provide $25 million \nfor other West Nile public health-related grants to States through the \nCDC to provide public education, information dissemination and basic \npublic health infrastructure. We have also included funding for tribal \nset asides through these two appropriations which is so important to \nour reservations that have been hit hard by West Nile this year with \nlittle financial assistance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, there is no doubt about the seriousness \nof the problem of West Nile. I made a trip to the Centers for Disease \nControl on Saturday and took a look at their operation, took a look at \ntheir charts, took a look at their projections as to where West Nile \nhad struck, the number of illnesses, the number of fatalities. However, \nwe are funding the Centers for Disease Control now at $5.760 billion. \nIt is true $1.100 billion is directed additionally for bioterrorism, \nbut that agency is extensively funded.\n  With respect to the allocation directly for West Nile, they have \n$36.760 million in this bill. We have in NIH at least $40 million more, \nfor a total of $76 million. Here again, I would like to see additional \nfunding if we had the money.\n  When we talk about the funding for the mosquitos of $100,000, I went \nover, in a lengthy visit at the Centers for Disease Control, their \npriorities and their needs. That is a program just recently authorized. \nThere was no request by the administration. With the tremendous \nconstraints on the rest of the bill we did not fund it. However, I \nbelieve we have adequately funded West Nile. And certainly we have \nfunded the Centers for Disease Control. So they are in a position to \nallocate additional funds if they think it is necessary. But on this \nphase of the record, I think our appropriations bill is adequate.\n\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, the manager of the bill is soon going to \noffer a unanimous consent request to start a series of votes forthwith: \nis that right?\n  Mr. SPECTER. That is correct, Madam President.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I say, while the Democratic leader is on \nthe floor, we on the minority side have said we are going to do \neverything we can to finish this bill today. But we have just been \ninformed that starting at 3:15, there will be no votes for probably 2 \nhours. That is going to make it very difficult.\n  So I hope during this first vote, the two leaders can visit to see if \nthere is some way we can condense that time. Otherwise, it is going to \nbe very difficult to finish this bill at a decent hour tonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I support what the assistant Democratic \nleader has had to say. We have six votes stacked now. We are going to \nhave quite a number of additional votes. There is a tempo around the \nSenate of completing the bill. If we are to finish this bill tonight, \nwe are going to have to work through.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. If the Senator yields, I, as chairman of the committee, \nunderstand fully the necessity to have these votes and this momentum \ncontinue. But in my time here in some 35 years, I have never seen the \nunveiling of a statue for Statuary Hall be interrupted by a vote.\n  I suggest if we are going to have votes, we could stack a vote. It \nonly means stacking one vote to do that. But from the hour of 4:30 to \n5:30, I believe the honor we are bestowing on the former Vice \nPresident, by putting his bust in the Hall, should be respected. I hope \nthe managers of the bill will comply with tradition and allow that to \ncontinue. It just merely means stacking a vote. If one, by chance, is \nto be scheduled between 4:30 and 5:30, I urge that it be stacked beyond \nthe hour of 5:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I say to my friend, the distinguished \nchairman of the committee, we will work any way we can. I served with \nSenator Quayle, Vice President Quayle, and want to make sure he \nreceives the honor to which he is entitled.\n  We also have a briefing upstairs, so it is not an hour we are \nconcerned about; it is 2 hours. We have an obligation on this side, \nhaving told the manager of the bill and the majority leader we would \nfinish this bill tonight. I am just saying, it is going to be really \ntough when we have 2 hours of basically doing nothing.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I suggest we move to the next vote.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1609\n\n  Madam President, the first vote is on the amendment offered by the \nSenator\n\n[[Page S11294]]\n\nfrom California, Mrs. Boxer, on afterschool programs. This account has \n$1 billion in it. It has an increase of some $400 million over and \nabove what the administration has requested.\n  Here again, if we had a larger allocation under the budget resolution \nfor this subcommittee, we could do more. But I think the appropriation \nof $1 billion is realistic and reasonable within the constraints of the \nsubcommittee.\n  Therefore, I raise a point of order under section 504 of the \nconcurrent resolution that the pending amendment is in violation of the \nBudget Act.\n  Mr. REID. Is the Senator talking about the Boxer amendment?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, under the applicable statutes, I move to \nwaive the budget point of order and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that on the \nsubsequent votes, as we proceed through as many votes as we can \ncomplete before 3:15, the votes be 10 minutes in duration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair and call for the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion. The \nyeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I announce that the Senator from Oregon (Mr. Smith) is \nabsent because of a death in the family.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nEdwards), the Senator from Florida (Mr. Graham), the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry), and the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. \nLieberman) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would vote ``aye.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 46, nays 49, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 340 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--46\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Ensign\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--49\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham (SC)\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--5\n\n     Edwards\n     Graham (FL)\n     Kerry\n     Lieberman\n     Smith\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote, the yeas are 46, the nays are \n49. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is rejected. The point of order is \nsustained, and the amendment falls.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished \nSenator from California from leader time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask a minute of my colleagues' time to \ncall attention to this vote we just cast because I think sometimes we \ngo through the motions and we do not connect the dollar amounts to the \nchildren.\n  We have just deprived 300,000 children in every one of our States of \nafterschool care, after being told by law enforcement that it helps \nsolve crime problems, after being told by parents that it makes their \nchildren happy, after learning from study after study that the kids do \nbetter.\n  I think it is very sad, indeed, for the children of America to know \nthey will not have this afterschool opportunity that will keep them on \nthe right track when we are giving billions of dollars to the children \nof Iraq and billions of dollars to the children of Afghanistan. Lord \nknows, I want to help them, too. But how about the children of America \nwho were promised in No Child Left Behind that they would get \nafterschool care?\n  This program has been flat-lined for 3 years in a row. It is a sad \nday, and I hope we will reverse ourselves at a future date.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Now we go to the Landrieu amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1610\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, there are fewer issues that bring \nconsensus to the table than the issue of adoption. We in this Congress \nhave worked in a bipartisan manner to help our families be stronger and \nsafer and to help children in foster care.\n  There are 570,000 children in foster care. This amendment allows us \nto help them with $118 million to live up to the commitments we have \nmade to these children.\n  Madam President, 100,000 of them are orphans. We promised to help \n25,000 who age out of foster care get a chance to go to college. These \nchildren have no parents. We are their parents. If we do not help them \nget to school, they are not going. That is what this amendment does.\n  We agree on adoption. We agree on improvements to foster care. Let us \nvote to increase the funding. It is minuscule and inconsequential to \nthis budget, but it is of enormous importance to this group of people \nand to these children.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, there is no doubt about the \ndesirability of the program encompassed in the amendment by the Senator \nfrom Louisiana. We already have in the account $100 million. I wish we \nhad more money, but that is the maximum we can do with the budget \nresolution within the allocation. Therefore, with reluctance, I raise a \npoint of order under the Budget Act and the resolution and say that the \namendment by the Senator from Louisiana is not in order.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the list \nof States and the amounts of money that will be lost be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be

The point of order is \nsustained and the amendment falls.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, may we proceed with the Durbin \namendment?\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1611\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, like many Members of the Senate, I voted \nin favor of No Child Left Behind, a bipartisan effort to bring \naccountability to education, mandates on local school districts to test \nkids, and if the test scores did not meet certain levels they would be \nmandated to make necessary changes in the way they taught the children. \nThe understanding was we would provide resources to the school \ndistricts to help them meet this challenge. This bill fails by $6 \nbillion to provide the resources for the school districts.\n  My amendment says this: We will suspend the mandates. We require the \ntesting to continue so we know the progress being made by the students. \nBut unless and until we are ready to fund this bill as we promised, we \nare suspending the mandates on the school districts to move children \nwithin the school districts, and the other mandated requirements.\n  I say to my friends, when you go home and speak to the leaders in \nschool districts, they will tell you, as good an idea as this was, \nSenator, you are not providing the funds. It is an unfunded Federal \nmandate.\n  I hope if you have heard the same story from your local school \ndistricts that are ready to work with us, ready to comply with No Child \nLeft Behind, you will join me in suspending these mandates until we \nreach the funding level we promised under No Child Left Behind.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield my time to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I will take 30 seconds and the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire 30 seconds.\n  Madam President, I ask the membership just to read the amendment:\n\n       None of the funds made available may be used by the \n     Department to enforce section 1116.\n\n  Section 1116 requires, out of the $12 billion, 10 percent to be used \nfor training teachers for struggling schools. It requires 10 percent or \nmore to be used for supplementary services for children. It provides \nflexibility for children in the poorest areas to have some choice for \npublic school choice.\n  It provides also about $800 million for new curriculum. Why in the \nworld do we want to have $3 billion of the $12 billion in a slush fund? \nWe know what works--good teachers, good curriculum, good supplementary \nservices. That was the bill that came out of our committee. That is \nwhat this will undermine. Just read the last three sentences. It says \nnothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit a State or local \nagency from implementing. That is an option. It isn't a requirement.\n  I hope the amendment will be defeated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I want to associate myself with Senator \nKennedy on this amendment. It is unfortunately ill conceived because \nits practical effect would be to deny parents the empowerment tools \nwhich we give them under the No Child Left Behind Act--specifically, \nthe tools to get tutorial services for their children if the school \nthey are in isn't working, and to get the opportunity to send their \nchildren to other public schools if the school they are in isn't \nworking.\n  The No Child Left Behind Act was aimed at low-income children and \ngiving parents of low-income children the tools to educate those \nchildren so they are not left behind.\n  The Durbin amendment would put a stake through the heart of the \nessence of the No Child Left Behind Act.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, how much time is allocated under this \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Ten minutes?\n  Mr. REID. No. Madam President, it is 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair understands that there is an \nagreement for 1 minute on each side.\n  Mr. DURBIN. How much has been consumed on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I am happy to hear everybody speak. But \nthis whole system is flawed. If we are going to have 1 minute, I would \nask the Chair to hold to 1 minute. I went to the Republican side today: \nPlease have the\n\n[[Page S11296]]\n\nChair stick to what the rules are. We want to try to finish this bill. \nBut these speeches are unending on both sides.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Madam President, this amendment is offered by myself \nand Senators Lautenberg, Cantwell, Baucus, Stabenow, Levin, Durbin, \nPryor, Lincoln, Kennedy, Kerry, and Feinstein.\n  This is an issue that I think deserves a little more attention before \nwe complete action on this appropriations bill.\n\n[[Page S11298]]\n\nThis an amendment that relates to LIHEAP, which is an acronym we use in \nthe Congress and in Washington to talk about the Low Income Home Energy \nAssistance Program.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letters from the American Gas \nAssociation, the Campaign for Home Energy Assistance, and the Southern \nStates Energy Board endorsing this amendment be printed in the Record \nfollowing my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, this amendment, as I have proposed it, \nwould increase funding in the bill for the Low Income Home Energy \nAssistance Program by $1 billion for this next fiscal year. The \namendment would bring the total funding for the LIHEAP State grants up \nto $3 billion rather than the $2 billion that is provided in the bill.\n  These grants are allocated at the beginning of each fiscal year to \neach of the 50 States and to the territories and Indian tribes on the \nbasis of a statutory formula.\n  Let me begin by saying, Senator Specter, the manager of this bill, \nand Senator Harkin, the ranking member on the subcommittee, have \nconsistently championed the LIHEAP program in the appropriations \nprocess. But it is clear they do not have room in this budget \nresolution that was presented to adequately fund this program.\n  Obviously, the question is, Why did we adopt a budget resolution that \ndid not provide room? I certainly think that is where the mistake was \nmade and where I disagreed with many of my colleagues.\n  The amount of funding for LIHEAP that has been appropriated in the \npast has been enough to help 15 percent of the households that are \neligible for that assistance. And as to those 15 percent, for the \nfamilies who are covered and actually have received that help, the \naverage grant they have received has covered about 10 to 25 percent of \ntheir home energy costs.\n  We had an amendment earlier today by Senator Reed of Rhode Island and \nSenator Collins of Maine on this very same issue--not on this exact \nissue but on adding funds. They proposed to add $300 million to the \nemergency funding available under the Low Income Home Energy Assistance \nProgram. Now my proposal is to add $1 billion to the core program--not \nthe emergency part of it but the core program.\n  I point out to my colleagues that 49 Senators voted for that \namendment as compared to 46 who voted against it, but the amendment \nfailed. And just for those who have not followed our procedure that \nclosely, why would an amendment fail when more Senators supported it \nthan opposed it? It failed because those Senators were not able to get \na full 60 votes which were needed to waive the Budget Act.\n  Well, the question is, Why did they need to waive the Budget Act for \nthat amendment? The amendment contained an offset so that it was not, \non a net basis, going to cost more, but we are advised that the offset \nwas not adequate to meet the Budget Act requirements. In fact, the \nvery underlying bill we are going to vote on, presumably later this \nevening, violates the Budget Act as well.\n\n  So we have a situation where the majority of Senators present and \nvoting cannot prevail on an issue they believe is important because of \nthe Budget Act provisions we imposed on ourselves and with which I \nstrongly disagree.\n  LIHEAP funding has remained essentially level without adjustment for \ninflation over the last 20 years. We all know the cost of energy to our \nhouseholds around the country has increased very substantially. Now 60 \npercent of our homes are, in fact, heated by natural gas and, in fact, \ncooled by that same energy source.\n  The Department of Energy predicts an average price delivered to the \nconsumer this year of $9.42 per thousand cubic feet for the cost of \nnatural gas. That $9.42 compares to $6.69 that the average consumer had \nto pay in 1999.\n  Compared to last winter, which was a very tough winter for gas \nconsumers, the Energy Information Agency predicts costs will be at \nleast 10 to 15 percent higher this year.\n  The reason I am raising this issue and talking about it is that I \nbelieve we will regret our decision to not provide additional funds for \nthe Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program when we get further into \nthis winter.\n  Forty-three of my colleagues in the Senate joined me in a bipartisan \nletter to Chairman Specter and Ranking Member Harkin requesting that \nthis core Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program be funded at the \nlevel of $3 billion for this next year. They have not been able to do \nthat.\n  We are faced with another winter heating season in which there is a \ngreat potential for very high natural gas costs, very high heating oil \nprices for consumers. There will be many low-income Americans who will \nhave great difficulty dealing with those increased prices.\n  The obvious question that will be asked of us and should be asked of \nus is what is our plan to deal with the expected high costs of energy \nthis winter? Unfortunately, our answer is, we are going to maintain \nlevel funding for LIHEAP. That is not an adequate answer. It is not an \nadequate answer for this administration or for this Congress. For us to \nsay we are sorry, we couldn't do any better because the budget \nresolution wouldn't let us, the budget resolution was voted on by a \nmajority of Senators, was approved by a majority of the Senators. \nClearly, the Senate shares the responsibility to find a solution to the \nproblem.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                     American Gas Association,\n\n                                                September 8, 2003.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the 191 members of the American \n     Gas Association who serve over 53 million consumers of \n     natural gas, I am writing in strong support of the Bingaman \n     and Reed-Collins amendments to increase funding for the Low \n     Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) during \n     consideration of the FY04 Labor, HHS and Education spending \n     bill.\n       The winter heating season is approaching and it is \n     imperative that funding for LIHEAP is increased. The LIHEAP \n     program is woefully under-funded, providing assistance to \n     approximately 4 million households, or only 15 percent of the \n     30 million households eligible for assistance. Yet demand for \n     energy assistance continues to grow due to high unemployment \n     levels, high energy prices and unpredictable weather \n     conditions.\n       According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the \n     unemployment rate in August remained extremely high at 6.1 \n     percent. A total of 8.9 million people currently are \n     unemployed across the country. Job losses were seen in the \n     manufacturing sector, some travel-related industries, and in \n     the retail industry.\n       At the same time, according to the Energy Information \n     Agency (EIA), compared to last year, this year's energy \n     prices are 30 percent higher for natural gas, 60 percent \n     higher for heating oil, 25 percent higher for propane and 11 \n     percent higher for electricity. The high energy prices are \n     due in large part to the unusually cold winter experienced in \n     various regions of the country this year, which increased \n     demand for home heating. Natural gas commodity prices \n     continue to bounce between $5.00 and $5.25 per mmbtu, and \n     natural gas storage inventories are 7.5 percent below the \n     five-year average.\n       The amendment proposed by Senator Bingaman would increase \n     LIHEAP funding to $3.0 billion, representing a $1 billion \n     increase over the $2.0 billion currently proposed in the FY04 \n     Labor, HHS and Education spending bill. The Reed-Collins \n     amendment would provide an additional $300 million in \n     emergency LIHEAP assistance. Both of these amendments will be \n     extremely helpful in protecting low and fixed-income \n     individuals during the winter heating season, and also will \n     make available much needed cooling assistance next summer.\n       We urge you to recognize the impact the weak economy and \n     the high price of energy is having on low and fixed-income \n     energy consumers. Low-income energy assistance must be \n     increased dramatically before we find ourselves in a crisis. \n     We strongly urge you to support the Bingaman and Reed-Collins \n     amendments. If you have any questions, suggestions or \n     concerns, please contact me personally at (202) 824-7111.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  David N. Parker,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      Campaign for\n\n\n                                       Home Energy Assistance,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 8, 2003.\n       Dear Senator: I am writing on behalf of the Campaign for \n     Home Energy Assistance to urge you to support the Bingaman \n     and Reed/Collins amendments to increase funding for the Low \n     Income Home Energy Assistance Program during consideration of \n     the Labor/HHS/Education Appropriations Bill for Fiscal 2004.\n       Senator Bingaman's amendment would increase baseline \n     funding LIHEAP (the ``regular'' allocations provided to the \n     states) from $2.0 billion to $3.0 billion. The Reed/Collins \n     amendment would add $300 million in\n\n[[Page S11299]]\n\n     LIHEAP emergency funds that could be released at the \n     President's discretion.\n       Both amendments will be extremely helpful in protecting \n     low- and fixed-income individuals during the winter heating \n     season and also make available sorely needed cooling \n     assistance next summer.\n       Price volatility, temperature extremes and an unstable \n     economy have combined to create a ``perfect storm'' that has \n     hammered our nation's most vulnerable citizens.\n       Seniors, people with disabilities and the working poor have \n     been particularly hard hit. They generally carry a higher \n     energy burden than most American households, and, for those \n     people, the price tag has become dangerously unaffordable.\n       In testimony before a congressional committee this past \n     summer, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said he was \n     worried about the runup in natural gas prices, which have \n     doubled over the past year, and the impact higher prices \n     could have on the economy. Secretary of Energy Spencer \n     Abraham, meanwhile, has warned that the average residential \n     winter heating bill for a typical Midwest consumer could be \n     $915 next winter--a 19 percent increase over last year--if \n     prices continue to rise.\n       If the warnings of the Fed Chairman and Energy Secretary \n     are to be taken seriously, and we believe they must, an \n     increase in LIHEAP funding is absolutely essential to protect \n     millions of people living in or on the edge of poverty.\n       According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 8.9 million \n     Americans are currently unemployed. The August unemployment \n     rate was at 6.1 percent, as high as it has been in many \n     years. The Energy Information Agency, meanwhile, has reported \n     that energy prices are 30 percent higher for natural gas, 60 \n     percent higher for heating oil, 25 percent higher for propane \n     and 11 percent higher for electricity compared with last \n     year.\n       We urge you to recognize the impact of this ``perfect \n     storm'' on those least able to cope with a higher energy \n     burden.\n       Even if energy prices were to decline and the economy were \n     to improve, LIHEAP would still be underfunded. Currently, \n     only about one out of every five households eligible for \n     benefits actually receives assistance. Many states regularly \n     run out of LIHEAP funds and are forced to limit benefits, \n     serve fewer eligible recipients or discontinue their programs \n     before the end of the heating season. In states where cooling \n     assistance is essential, programs also fall far short of the \n     need.\n       Please support the Bingaman and Reed/Collins LIHEAP \n     amendments to the Labor/HHS/Education Appropriations Bill. \n     Your leadership will help many low- and fixed-income \n     consumers through these difficult times. Thank you in advance \n     for your consideration.

In light of unprecedented costs for natural gas, \n     and for other reasons, LIHEAP is being stretched beyond its \n     capacity to meet this challenge. Today, only 15 percent of \n     eligible Americans can be served by LIHEAP. In the face of \n     escalating energy costs, it seems certain even fewer \n     Americans will be helped--unless the Senate votes to increase \n     LIHEAP funding.\n       In its present form, LIHEAP is ill-equipped to respond to \n     the needs of our citizens unless Congress appropriates \n     additional funds for this critical program. Mr. Bingaman's \n     amendment does this, and closely conforms to the SLC's \n     recently unanimously-adopted LIHEAP policy position.\n       The SLC is pleased to endorse the Bingaman LIHEAP Amendment \n     to the 2004 Labor/HHS appropriations bill and urges each \n     Senator to vote for it.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 1588 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, in light of the fact that a 60-vote \nmajority would be required for me to prevail on my amendment and in \nlight of the fact that earlier amendment on a related issue by Senators \nReed and Collins could not gain more than 49 votes, I will not push for \na rollcall vote on my amendment at this time. I do call it to the \nattention of my colleagues. I hope at some stage before we adjourn this \nfall we are able to find a way to put additional funds into this very \nimportant program so as to head off the very real hardship that is \ngoing to be visited upon many of our citizens this winter.\n  Madam President, I withdraw the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is withdrawn.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS.

Would \nyou give me the number of that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is No. 1603.\n  Mr. REID. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. President, I don't think anyone would disagree that children are \nthe hope of every culture. They certainly are the hope of this culture \nin our great country of America.\n  We look to our children and imagine a bright future for their sake. \nThis is true for every group in America and every subgroup in America. \nIt could not be more true for Latino Americans. Latinos are the \nyoungest demographic group in the entire country. They are the fastest \ngrowing.\n  More than one-third of Latino Americans are under 18 years of age. \nMany came here with nothing to their name. Many of them had no \neducation and some couldn't speak English. For these people, life is \nwhat it is and sometimes there is no hope of improving. But one thing \nthat the Hispanic community does is work hard. They work hard in many \ninstances to make a simple living. Some of them clean our houses, \nlandscape our yards, wait on tables, park cars, make beds, and in other \nplaces they harvest the food for our tables.\n  They don't complain about their lot in life, but they dream of better \nopportunities for their children--our children--because children are \nthe hope of the future.\n  The great aspiration of Latino Americans, as all immigrants who come \nto our country, is their children getting a good education.\n  We recognize that there is an unacceptable gap between the \nachievement of Latino students and the overall student population. In \nthe State of Nevada, we have the fifth or sixth largest school district \nin all of America, approaching 300,000 students. Thirty percent of the \nkids in that school district are Hispanic. Large numbers of those \nchildren in comparison to other ethnic groups don't graduate from high \nschool.\n  Some have asked why. All the reasons are not in but some of the \nreasons are they are such hard-working people, the business community \nrecognizes that and, in many instances, entices them to work and not to \nschool by offering them jobs. They are young and impressionable, and a \njob offers what appears to them to be a lot of money; as they proceed \nthrough life, they continue to earn the same money as adults as they \nearned when they were teenagers. They drop out of school for that \nreason.\n\n[[Page S11300]]\n\n  Also, most of the Hispanics in the State of Nevada come from Mexico. \nMexico does not have the tradition of public education we have, which \nis another reason there are dropouts. Of course they do not have the \nparental involvement as a result of their parents not being educated.\n  So there are a number of reasons. All the reasons are not in. I have \nnamed a couple of the reasons these young boys and girls drop out of \nhigh school much more quickly than other ethnic groups. We agree it \nshould be this Nation's policy to leave no child behind. This does not \nsay we leave no Caucasian child behind. This act does not say we leave \nno Asian American behind. This act does not say we leave no African \nAmerican behind. No, this act says we leave no child behind no matter \ntheir race, creed, or culture.\n  Now it is time to live up to those words and keep our promise. That \nis why I offer this amendment, amendment No. 1603, the Hispanic \neducational opportunity amendment to help Latino students achieve their \ndreams. This amendment invests an additional $190 million in our \nNation's future by strengthening these programs.\n  I told my good friend, the Democrat manager, the amendment was $210 \nmillion--and it was, earlier--and we changed it for a number of \nreasons. This is for Hispanic-serving institutions, migrant education, \nhigh school equivalency programs, college assistance migrant programs, \nlocal family information centers, bilingual education and Head Start \nfor children of migrant workers. These programs give Latino students a \nstep up the ladder of education so they can realize their aspirations.\n  The 252 Hispanic-serving institutions, which have at least 25 percent \nLatino enrollment, are the main bridge between Hispanic opportunities \nand higher education. Despite appropriations under title V, these \ninstitutions still have not reached Federal funding parity with other \ndegree-granting institutions. This amendment adds $6.4 million to help \naddress this inequity.\n  The high school equivalency programs provide academic instruction, \ncounseling, computer-assisted teaching, and career awareness to migrant \nstudents for the GED. The Senate's fiscal year 2004 Labor, HHS, and \nEducation appropriations bill slashes funding for these programs by 43 \npercent and eliminates 23 programs that achieved a combined GED \ncompletion rate of 73 percent.\n  The proposed budget also cuts the College Assistance Migrant Program \nby $400,000. CAMP, or the College Assistance Migrant Program, recruits \nare talented migrant high school graduates, GED recipients, and they \nmentor them through their first year of college. Before CAMP was \ncreated, there was no record of a migrant child having completed \ncollege. Since its inception, nearly 75 percent of all CAMP students \nreceive a college baccalaureate degree.\n  The existing HEP and CAMP programs serve approximately 15,000 \nstudents. Remember, for every one of these students we keep in school \nor put through college, we save our country much money. It is estimated \nthat for every $1 we spend on the programs, we save the Government \nupwards of $10 in justice costs, insurance costs, welfare costs. For \nevery child we keep in one of these programs, our country makes money. \nOver the next 5 years, 170,000 migrant children will become eligible \nfor this program while 140,000 will qualify for CAMP. Funding for these \nprograms should be increased, not cut. That is why my amendment adds \n$11 million for HEP programs and $1 million for CAMP.\n\n  We also need to make the Head Start Program available to more \nchildren of migrant workers so they have a fighting chance to do well \nin school. In the relatively small State of Nevada, we have hundreds of \nmigrant students. In Amargossa, in Nye County, they make up more than \nhalf of the students. These children, many times, have very hard lives. \nIf any child ever deserved a head start in school, they do. Yet we have \nnot a single migrant Head Start Program in all of the State of Nevada.\n  About 20 percent of the State of Nevada is Hispanic. Nationally, only \n19 percent of the eligible migrant children are served by Head Start. \nThe rest are left behind, even before they begin school, even though we \nhave a program that says Leave No Child Behind. We need to offer Head \nStart to at least 10,000 migrant children. This amendment moves us \ntoward that goal.\n  We know that parental involvement is crucial to a child's success. \nThat is why the local family information centers were created by the No \nChild Left Behind Act. These are community-based centers that provide \nparents of title I students with information about their children's \nschools so they can get involved in their education. It does much more. \nAn additional investment here of $13 million strengthens ties between \nLatino families and the children's schools. We know parental \ninvolvement is a success for the teachers and for the students. This \nmight seem like a lot of money, but it will save much more, as I have \nstated, in the long run--almost 10 to 1. You do not have to be from \nNevada to bet on these odds.\n  One way this investment will pay dividends down the road is by \nbuilding a stronger labor force. Already, one-third of new workers who \njoin our labor force are Latino. In 20 years, it will be one-half. \nThese are the workers who will pay our taxes, build our roads, keep our \nmilitary strong, educate our grandchildren, protect our environment.\n  It is important we educate our grandchildren and our great \ngrandchildren and provide for our Social Security. Our own future will \ndepend upon the hopes, the aspirations, and the dreams of our Latino \nneighbors. These programs might not seem that important to some, but to \nthe individuals involved, they provide greater opportunities for these \nchildren. They give Latino Americans, their parents, but also all \nAmericans, a better chance for having a better society. They give these \nboys and girls a chance for realizing their dreams and aspirations.\n  We had a vote similar to this earlier this week. We had the usual \nperformances on both sides of the aisle: Vote with me; vote with me; do \nnot vote with the minority; the vote might pass. We had three very \ncourageous Republicans crossing over the line and voting for these \nyoung boys and girls: Senator Smith of Oregon, Senator Hutchison of \nTexas, and Senator Domenici of New Mexico. I appreciate the courage and \ntheir individualism, their independence, in voting for these young \npeople.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Thank you, Madam President. I thank the Senator from \nArizona, who I understand has a legitimate concern about the way this \nbill is proceeding, and I appreciate his indulgence in allowing me to \ntalk about an amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Could I ask my friend a question?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I would be happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. REID. We have a vote scheduled for 5:20. We may not be able to \nhave it now. You are going to speak probably until that time?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Maybe not until that time, but no longer than that \ntime. I will certainly stop whenever we are ready to move forward with \nany pending business.\n  Madam President, a couple months ago we had a very good debate, late \nat night on the floor of the Senate, on the issue of AIDS in Africa. We \nmade a commitment in that authorization bill to follow through with the \nPresident's plan, his announcement earlier this year to put forward $15 \nbillion over the next 5 years to meet this scourge that is ravaging so \nmany countries in sub-Saharan Africa, the scourge of AIDS.\n  The President had the moral courage and provided leadership to the \nworld prior to the G-8 summit to come forth with a big commitment of \nAmerican dollars, of $15 billion over the next 5 years, to combat AIDS, \nin terms of education, prevention, treatment, transmission--all of the \nareas that are so important and were, frankly, being neglected by the \nworld community.\n  America had done a reasonable job in providing some funds--roughly $1 \nbillion a year--toward this problem. The\n\n[[Page S11301]]\n\nPresident stepped up and said: No, that is not sufficient. We need to \ndo $15 billion over the next 5 years. The President made a budget \nrequest that put us on the road to that. It was not $3 billion a year \nfor 5 years, but it was an aggressive increase in the amount of funding \nthe United States would provide.\n  Subsequent to his budget request, we passed an authorization bill \nwhich said the following: that this country would come up with $10 \nbillion in bilateral aid, through our agencies of the Federal \nGovernment. We would be contributing money either directly to other \ncountries or to nonprofit, sometimes faith-based, organizations for \nprevention, education, treatment, and other means of dealing with this \nproblem.\n  Unfortunately, in this bill, and in the foreign operations \nappropriations bill, the combined amount of money for the accounts for \nthe President's AIDS initiative comes not to $3 billion but to a little \nover $2 billion, $2.050 billion.\n  Now having said that, this is a tight budget year. And it is a \nsignificant increase over the amount of money that was provided for \nlast year, which was an increase in last year's appropriations. So I do \nnot want to cast any aspersions on any of the appropriators for the \nwork they have done. They have provided a significant amount of \nincrease appropriate with the President's--close to, not exactly but \nclose to what the President originally suggested prior to his big AIDS \ninitiative.\n  I would suggest that what we need to do in the Senate is, to the best \nof our ability, meet the expectations we set with respect to the \npassage of the authorization bill a couple months ago--the expectations \nof the world community, which in the G-8 summit responded generously \nwith contributions they were told would be matched by Federal dollars \nto the tune of for every $2 of international contribution to the Global \nFund there would be a $1 contribution from the U.S. Government for up \nto 1 billion of U.S. dollars going into the Global Fund.\n  To date, we have received roughly $700 million in commitments from \nthe international community, which means that to fund our match in this \nbill we would need roughly $350 million. So for $700 million of \ninternational commitment, $350 million--$1 for every $2 pledged--would \nbe necessary in either this bill or the foreign operations \nappropriations bill.\n  I am happy to say in the two bills combined, there is $400 million \nfor the global fund earmarked for matching, and that is in anticipation \nof some additional dollars being pledged by some other countries. There \nare a couple of other very significant countries yet that have not \npledged, and I think with great foresight the members of the \nAppropriations Committee put forward roughly $400 million to match the \nanticipated contributions from the rest of the world.\n  So on that score, I would make the argument that the authorization \nlevels we had committed have been fulfilled. Some have suggested--in \nfact, others who have offered an amendment on this subject suggested--\nwe need to appropriate $3 billion to meet our commitment of $3 billion \na year for 5 years. The commitment was $2 billion a year plus whatever \nwas necessary to match up to $1 billion.\n  It seems fairly obvious the match necessary is only going to be no \nmore than $400 million. So I would argue the $400 million that is in \nthese bills is sufficient to meet the commitment this country made, \nthis Senate made, and this President made in matching dollars from the \ninternational community, which leaves us with the bilateral commitment.\n  The bilateral commitment was $2 billion in the authorization bill. \nThe President has said from the start that he was not going to start \nout at $2 billion. He was going to start out at a lesser number and \nramp up as capacity was going to grow. I respect that. I know the \nPresident is trying to stay within a very tight budget with respect to \nboth foreign and domestic programs, other than what would be considered \nwar-related expenditures. He came forward with a proposal for about \n$1.6 billion.\n  The two bills dealing with AIDS funding come up to the level of $1.65 \nbillion. So the combined amount, the 400 and 1.65 is $2.50 billion, \nwhich is short of the authorization level by $350 million.\n  That $350 million would allow us to fully fund our $2 billion \ncommitment under the authorization. Again, I understand that the House \nlevel is lower than that. I think it is important for us in the Senate \nto come forth with a number that is closer to what the expectation was \nwhen we put forward this authorizing legislation a couple months ago.\n  I am going to be offering an amendment a little later--because I told \nSenator McCain that I would not be conducting any formal business, that \nI would just be talking about my amendment--to transfer $350 million to \nprovide treatment and prevention programs to combat global HIV/AIDS. I \nunderscore this: I am trying to do this so we can win this with 50 \nvotes, in case of so many Members missing, maybe 46 or 47 votes. I \nwould like to see this pass. I would like to see us make that \ncommitment. Two point four billion dollars does meet the commitment \nthat this Congress was put on the record for a couple months ago.\n  This is a rather big bill, almost a half-trillion-dollar piece of \nlegislation before us. What I am requesting my colleagues to do is to \nsupport an across-the-board reduction of .0741, seven hundred forty-one \nthousandths of a percent reduction in all other funding so we could \nmeet our commitment to the millions of people suffering in Africa and \nthe Caribbean from this scourge of AIDS. I know there are a lot of \npeople in the Chamber who don't like across-the-board cuts, thinking \nthey are a gimmick. I assure you, those agencies that have experienced \nacross-the-board cuts do not believe they are a gimmick. They are real. \nThey reduce the amount of money in their appropriated account, and they \nhave to deal with the consequences.\n  There are lots of programs that have received substantial increases \nin funding that surely a seven-hundredths-of-a-percent reduction is not \ngoing to have any kind of dramatic impact on them. But I assure you, a \n$350 million commitment to providing treatment and prevention--one of \nthe programs that is underfunded in this legislation that Senator \nDeWine has an amendment on is mother-to-child transmission. The money \nprovided in this bill is actually lower than what the President \nrequested.\n  We are doing a lot for people in America. I know there is a lot of \nneed in America. But I think when you compare the need in America to \nthe abject poverty and horrific health conditions in this area of the \nworld, I cannot imagine that any one of these organizations that are \nproviding help to those who are struggling here in this country, \nthrough health problems or whether it is improving the quality of \neducation, that they wouldn't be willing to give seven-hundredths of a \npercent of their dollars up to save hundreds of thousands of lives \nacross Africa.\n  That is what we are asking. I know it is not a popular thing to do. \nIt is probably easier to say we will just borrow the money or we will \nadvance fund or we will forward fund or backward fund or sideways fund, \ndo some other gimmick to get around the budget rules so we don't have \nto count. It is important to put your money where your mouth is.\n  I don't think asking for a seven-hundredths of 1 percent across-the-\nboard reduction to provide the money for those in the most need of the \nbrother and sisters that we have in this world is too much to ask. I \nask my colleagues on this side of the aisle, those of you who voted for \nthe President's plan on HIV/AIDS, those of you who have just come back \nfrom Africa--I know there are many Members who were in Africa over the \nbreak who saw firsthand the tremendous human suffering that is going on \nthere as a result of this pandemic. Seven-hundredths of a percent to \nprovide the much needed medicine to treat those mothers suffering from \nHIV/AIDS, to prevent the next orphan from occurring in Africa, to \nprevent mother-to-child transmissions so we don't have children born \nwho will be orphans if the mothers don't get treatment and then they \nthemselves will contract AIDS--we can do something that is real, \ntangible, that saves lives and improves the quality of the life of the \npeople and gives, more importantly, some hope to those who have no\n\n[[Page S11302]]\n\nhope. To a world that has in many respects turned their backs to this \nproblem, we will show here in the U.S. Senate that we are willing to \ngive up a little bit, a little bit across the board from programs that \nmay get us votes back home, seven-hundredths of a percent to provide \nfor those who have no voice in the Senate.\n  I know at 5:20 we were hoping to try to get some votes. We are \nreaching that time, so I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask an inquiry of Senator Reid of \nNevada. If he could tell me, I was going under the impression that we \nwould move to a vote at 5:20 and I would speak to the amendment which I \nhave pending, but if there is other information I should be aware.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, the Senator from Arizona was concerned. He \nhad some questions. I have checked with the people on the majority. He \nhas no problem with our going ahead with the first vote. So I say to my \nfriend from Illinois, within a minute, the Chair will call the vote in \ncompliance with the order previously entered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. May I inquire of the Chair, is there a unanimous consent \nagreement as to the time allocated to myself as sponsor of the \namendment and anyone in opposition to speak before the roll is called?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is an agreement for 2 minutes equally \ndivided before the vote on the amendment.\n  Mr. REID. I would say to the Chair, it is my understanding, also, we \nare going to do a better job of enforcing the 1-minute rule.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will be so advised.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. May I further inquire at this point if the amendment has \nnot been called, may I be recognized to speak, or is it time?\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1613\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nDurbin Amendment be the pending business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  There are now 2 minutes equally divided. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, for those tortured souls who are \nfollowing this debate, understand what we have said about the \ncenterpiece of education reform in America, No Child Left Behind. \nYesterday, we said we were unwilling to provide the funds that we \npromised to make No Child Left Behind work--unwilling to provide the \ntitle I funds. We are going to undercut that funding by some $6 billion \nso money will not be available to help tutor children who are not doing \nwell on tests.\n  In the previous amendment, I said if we are not going to provide the \nfunds, we should not mandate the school districts to comply with No \nChild Left Behind, and that was defeated. So the Members of the Senate \nsaid, despite the fact we have not funded No Child Left Behind, we are \ngoing to enforce mandates on the school districts in America.\n  Now I give colleagues another chance. This says that when it comes to \nteacher quality and mandates in No Child Left Behind, we will provide \nthe money we promised so that the teacher in the classroom is qualified \nto teach. It is a $450 million amendment. I commend it to my \ncolleagues.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, the chairman of the committee has worked \nhard to resolve this issue in the current legislation. We have $3.378 \nbillion as it relates to teacher quality programs and the enhancement \nthereof. This is a substantial increase. There is probably never \nenough, but because of the caps and the allocations necessary, there is \nmore now than there ever has been.\n  I hope our colleagues will stand with the committee and chairman in \nopposing the Durbin Amendment.\n  With that, I raise a point of order under section 504 of the \nconcurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal 2004 that the amendment \nexceeds the discretionary spending limits in this specified section and \nis not in order.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, pursuant to section 504(b)(2) of H. Con. \nRes. 95, I move to waive section 504 of that concurrent resolution for \npurposes of the pending amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I announce that the Senator from Minnesota (Mr. \nColeman) and the Senator from Oregon (Mr. Smith) are absent because of \na death in the family.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nEdwards), the Senator from Florida (Mr. Graham), the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry), and the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. \nLieberman) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would vote ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The point of order is \nsustained, and the amendment falls.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1585\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there are 2 minutes \nevenly divided before the vote in respect to the Ensign amendment. Who \nyields time?\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I will be very brief. This amendment is adding $100 \nmillion for the afterschool programs. It is offset. We do a small \nacross-the-board cut; it will only be .012 percent for the programs. I \nthink any of the programs can take that. But in the process, we are \ngoing to be helping a lot of kids who otherwise are going to be \nbecoming juvenile delinquents. We know the statistics. If you don't \nhave kids in the right activities, they get into trouble. If they are \nsitting around with nothing to do, they get into trouble. Afterschool \nprograms are perhaps one of the best anticrime measures we can take. I \nencourage my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I say to my colleagues, be prepared. \nThis is the first of the across-the-board cut amendments. As good as it \nsounds, afterschool programs, this is what this little cut will cost. \nIt will deny 92 grants for research at the National Institutes of \nHealth, it will take 1,134 kids out of the Head Start Program, it\n\n[[Page S11303]]\n\nwill mean 6,494 households will not be served by LIHEAP, and 403,000 \nmeals for seniors will not be served.\n  This is a get-well amendment for many of our colleagues who have \nconsistently voted against these education programs. Please, as good as \nit sounds, don't cut these valuable resources for NIH and other \neducation programs to fund the afterschool programs as suggested by the \nSenator from Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, tomorrow the Nation will bow our heads in \nprayer as we remember those who perished 2 years ago. As we close our \neyes to remember those who perished in the World Trade Towers and the \nPentagon and in the quiet field in Pennsylvania, we cannot help but \nrecall the graphic images of the attacks that shocked the American \npsyche, the smoke, the fire, the pain, the falling towers. The courage \ndisplayed on television sets on September 11, 2001, brought all \nAmericans to the scene of those attacks.\n  Our Nation united to fight those who were responsible for those \nterrible acts. Since then, our Armed Forces swept through the rugged \nterrain of Afghanistan, deposing a government that directly aided Osama \nbin Laden in his mission to attack America by any means at hand.\n  In the days following the attacks, Congress acted swiftly to provide \nessential funds for this military response. The appropriations \ncommittees in both Houses acted without delay. But we also included \nincreased moneys for homeland security and the reconstruction of New \nYork and the Pentagon.\n  But today our fight against terrorism has lost a good deal of its \nfocus. Our homeland security efforts are underfunded. The Department of \nHomeland Security is a bureaucratic catastrophe. The White House has \nprioritized tax cuts over protecting our airliners and securing our \nports.\n  Through carefully worded rhetoric, the administration has morphed the \nimage of America's most wanted man from Osama bin Laden to Saddam \nHussein. It is as if the President has forgotten the name of the \nmastermind of the attacks that killed 3,031 in New York and Washington \non September 11, 2001; the attacks that killed 17 sailors on the USS \nCole on October 12, 2000; and the attacks that killed 224 U.S. and \nforeign nationals in bombings of American embassies in Kenya and \nTanzania on August 7, 1998. The name of that man is not Saddam Hussein. \nIt is Osama bin Laden, the elusive terrorist who this administration so \nrarely bothers to mention by name anymore.\n  The President has now stated that the war in Iraq is the central \nfront on the war against terrorism. But it was our invasion of Iraq \nthat has turned Iraq into a staging ground for daily terrorist attacks \nagainst our occupation forces. If we are serious about protecting our \ncountry from terrorism, it seems to me that the central front should be \nthe war on al-Qaida.\n  If we are serious about protecting our country from terrorism, should \nnot the central front be the war on al-Qaida? For that matter, isn't \nthe violence between Israelis and Palestinians actually the root of \nmuch of the terrorism in the world? Why isn't reaching a lasting peace \nagreement between those two peoples the central front on fighting \ninternational terrorism?\n  But at the White House, the subject of terrorism now means the \nsubject of our invasion of Iraq. The President waves the bloody shirt \nof 9/11, and then subtly shifts the conversation to Iraq. The only \nproblem is that the President's attempts to tie Saddam Hussein to the \n9/11 attacks have no basis in fact. There has been no evidence of such \nfound to date. By speaking of al-Qaida in one breath and Iraq in the \nnext, the President has devised a construct for confusing the American \npeople about the real threat to this country. And his strategy has \nworked. According to a Washington Post poll, 7 in 10 Americans believe \nthat Saddam Hussein was behind the September 11 attacks. That was not \nthe case. There is no evidence that that was the case.\n  Amidst the confusion of the American people, it was the stated policy \nof White House adviser Karl Rove to use the war against terrorism for \npartisan electoral advantage. The White House rode that political \nbandwagon right through Congress in October of 2002, securing a war \nresolution in the weeks just before a major election. The bandwagon \nthen bypassed the United Nations, alienating our friends and allies, \nand charged right into Baghdad, powered by a national security strategy \nthat brought the first use of preemptive war in the history of our \nNation.\n  Soon Congress, we understand, will be formally presented with a \nrequest for $87 billion in additional funding for the war. The White \nHouse would prefer to call this massive spending bill the ``terrorism \nsupplemental.'' Don't fall for that, I say to my colleagues. I say to \nthe American people, don't fall for that. The American people should \nnot be misled by these word games. The spending in this proposal has \nlittle to do with protecting the American people from terrorism.\n\n  This request should be called what it is: the second Iraq \nsupplemental appropriations bill in less than 6 months. It is a budget-\nbusting, deficit-enhancing $87 billion on top of the $103.3 billion in \nadditional funds that Congress has already provided to the Pentagon \nsince September 11, 2001. Including this new spending for Iraq, the \nbudget deficit for next year can be expected to exceed $550 billion. \nHow are we going to pay for this mistake that we have made in the \nMiddle East?\n  I expect to support the funds that are needed for the safety of our \ntroops, but I will not rubberstamp every spending request that comes \ndown the pike. This $87 billion package needs to be carefully examined. \nCongress is not an ATM that will spit out cash on a moment's notice.\n  I have questions. I am sure that my colleagues, most of them, \ncertainly, or many of them, have questions about the $20 billion in \nnation-building funds that are contained, or will be contained, if we \nunderstand correctly what we read in the newspapers and what we hear in \nother areas of the media with respect to the President's request. The \nformal request has not reached Congress as yet, of course. But initial \nindications show that the administration intends to go beyond repairing \nthe damage to Iraq's infrastructure and attempt to build a modernized \ncountry from the ground up.\n  Congress needs to ask questions about this plan. There has actually \nnever been a debate in Congress about postwar Iraq. Before we approve \nof this spending, we must know how long this nation-building plan will \ntake and how the costs will be shared among our allies.\n  I have some questions about the funds that will be requested for our \nmilitary. The administration announced this week that it is extending \nthe deployments of our National Guard and our Reserves in Iraq. Many of \nthese citizen-soldiers are already exhausted from back-to-back foreign \ndeployments. The National Guard cannot perform its important homeland \nsecurity missions if it is half a world away. We are headed towards \nserious problems with recruiting and retention if this administration \nthinks that it can keep the men and women of the Guard and Reserve away \nfrom their families and their jobs for 12 months, 15 months, or even 18 \nmonths on each deployment.\n  Most importantly, this $87 billion Iraq supplemental--remember, it is \nnot a terrorism supplemental, it has nothing to do with terrorism here \nin this country--this Iraq supplemental could be the first installment \nin what the President's advisers describe as a ``generational \ncommitment'' to building democracy in the Middle East. I do not recall \na single word in the President's case for war in which he said that the \nwar in Iraq would be the beginning of a decades-long engagement in that \nvolatile part of the world. The American people ought to hear an \nexplanation of what it means to have a ``generational commitment'' to \nnation building and perhaps regime change in the Middle East.\n  Tomorrow, the American people will pause to remember those who lost \ntheir lives 2 years ago. I will long remember that fateful day, as will \nevery Member\n\n[[Page S11304]]\n\nof this Senate and every person within the range of my hearing. I \ncannot forget the toll exacted on Americans in those attacks, nor will \nI forget the courage of the firefighters and the police who rushed into \nburning buildings, nor will I forget those ordinary people on that \nairliner who fought back against its hijackers. Those people very \nlikely saved this Capitol from another terrible attack, and, along with \nthe Capitol, saved the lives of many of us who are in this Chamber \ntoday.\n  But when Members of Congress return from the memorial services, we \nhave serious work to do in addressing the crisis in Iraq and in our \nfight against terrorism at home. We will soon be presented with a \nrequest for $87 billion to carry out the administration's occupation \nand nation-building plans in Iraq.\n  Let us take a good look at those plans. Let us be prepared to ask \nquestions about them. There is no reason why this request will have to \ngo sailing through Congress in a day or a day and a half or 2 days or \n3. We need to ask questions. The administration should be prepared to \nmake its case and be prepared to answer questions.\n  It is not disrespectful to ask questions. It is not unpatriotic to \nask questions. Members of Congress should not be intimidated. They \nshould not be cowed. They should not be afraid to ask questions. The \npeople of America are not here to ask questions. The students in our \nschools are not here to ask questions. We are here to ask questions.\n  Let us not act with the same haste and impatience that led our \ncountry to begin that war nearly 6 months ago.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/10/senate-section/article/S11304-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11304-S11305]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            REMEMBERING 9/11\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, on the eve of the second anniversary of \n9/11, I feel compelled to take the floor and share with my colleagues \nsome of my thoughts. As a New Yorker, of course, as somebody who lives \nwithin sight and looks every morning, when I am home in New York, out \nmy window at the empty space that once was occupied by the twin towers, \nthis is something that never escapes my mind and the mind of every New \nYorker. It doesn't escape the mind of every American, and probably \ndoesn't escape the mind of just about every citizen of the world. \nBecause 9/11 changed us in many ways, and we can never go back. But \nhopefully we can learn from it.\n  I would like to address at least my thoughts to three different \nareas: Those of the families and victims and those who rushed to help \nthem; the city and the State of New York; and how it has affected us as \na Nation.\n  First, of course, we think of the families. The day after that \nhorrible terrorist attack occurred, I asked Americans to wear the flag \nor display the flag out their windows. I put on this very flag. I wear \nit every day in memory of those who were lost and, God willing, I will \nwear it every day for the rest of my life in their memory. We think of \ntheir bravery, the bravery, of course, of the 343 firefighters who were \nlost, the many police officers, Port Authority personnel, and the first \nresponders who were lost.\n  We think of the bravery of average citizens. There was just a story \nin our New York newspapers about two men who braved the fires and \nbraved the smoke and created a passageway and saved the lives of \nperhaps a dozen and then went back up to try and save more and \nperished. In a very real sense, those heroes will live with us forever, \nlike the heroes at Bunker Hill and the heroes at Gettysburg and the \nheroes on D-Day and the heroes of all the great battles our Nation has \nfaced. Many of those heroes are civilians--whether they be police, \nfire, EMT, or just ordinary citizens. That shows you how our world has \nchanged because we are all on the front lines.\n  We think of their families as well; the hole in their hearts will \nnever heal. It is not simply the loss, although that is overwhelming \nand preponderant. It is that they were taken in such an act of bitter \nmeanness and nastiness and atrocity. We have to do everything for them. \nWe have to be with them spiritually. We have to provide for them, and \nwe have to, in a sense, sanctify the memory of those who were lost for \nwhom they mourn every day.\n  I can think of the faces in front of me right now of some of the \npeople I knew--a brave firefighter, a friend who led a company, a high \nschool classmate with whom I played basketball--all gone, simply \nbecause some vicious, terrible people thought they had a deranged \nmessage. We will never forget the families. And if you ask the families \nand ask the victims what they want us to do, they would want us to keep \nour resolve. And keep our resolve we must.\n  New Yorkers, Americans, good citizens of the world must keep their \nresolve. As for my city, we are still wounded. Still, every day, so \nmany of us look up at the skyline and see the empty place. People who \ngo on the subway or get in the car or just walk down the street every \nso often say, Could it happen again? Our city is still wounded. We have \nsuffered large economic loss, but we have suffered far greater personal \nloss. But the amazing thing about New York is that we are strong, we \nare vital, and we rebound.\n  I am so proud of New Yorkers. I was proud of New Yorkers on the day \nit happened. Many people rose to the occasion. I always think of the \nman who owned a sneaker store. He stood outside the store and gave all \nthe women who were fleeing the World Trade Center sneakers. He said, \n``What size are you?'' and he gave them a pair of sneakers because it \nwould be hard to walk in their heels. Those acts of generosity have \ncontinued.\n  The fortitude of New Yorkers has also continued. Battery Park City, a \nresidential area by the World Trade Center, which emptied out is full \nagain. Businesses are beginning to return. A leading law firm came back \nto downtown and opened last week. So the plans proceed apace. Because \nwe are New Yorkers, of course, there are some disputes, but the plans \nproceed apace for how we should rebuild--both remembering those who \nwere lost and also remembering that terrorists tried to destroy the \ncommercial greatness of our city. We are going to rebuild commercially \nas well. I was so proud of the polls that showed that more New Yorkers \nsaid they wanted to stay in New York after 9/11 than before 9/11. That \nis the spirit of the city. It is a great city.\n  It is the spirit of the whole New York area because there were people \nwho lived in the suburbs who rushed in to help, and they all suffered \nlosses. It is the spirit of our whole State, where people from Buffalo \nin the north and every point in between rushed to New York City and \nhelped us, and we try to remember to help them.\n  We are grateful that the Nation has remembered us. The money we \nworked on to bring back to New York is being spent wisely and being \nspent well. We are not rushing to spend it. Every so often, there is a \nnewspaper article that says not all of it has been spent. Of course \nnot. But the fact that the President--and I give him credit. We \ndisagree on many issues, but he stood by New York and he remembered \nwhat we needed and never broke his word. This Senate and the House, \nboth Democrats and Republicans, again, had disputes about how to do it, \nbut the Congress was very generous to our city. We may come back and \nneed more, of course, but the generosity is real, remembered, and \nappreciated by New Yorkers.\n  Finally, what did we learn on 9/11? We learned that the very \ntechnology that blessed our lives and accounted for so much of the \nprosperity we have seen in the last two decades has a dark and evil \nunderside; namely, that small groups of bad people can get ahold of \nthat technology and do tremendous damage in our country. You can be in \na cave in Afghanistan, and if you have a wireless connection to the \nInternet, you can learn as much about America as many of us know. The \nsad fact is, if you took 200 people anywhere in the world, or maybe a \nthousand, and injected them with the ``evil virus'' and they would \ndecide to fanatically devote themselves to hurting America for the next \n5 years, the odds are too high that they could succeed. But we are \nbeginning to respond to that challenge.\n\n  The war against terrorism is not a\n1-, 2-, or 3-year phenomenon. It is going to be a 30-, 40-, or 50-year \nphenomenon. Today is not the day to bring up the disputes that we all \nhave about this issue, but it is rather to say that it is brand new, \nand every one of us should walk humbly before proffering solutions \nbecause in a certain sense, we have no experience pool. Mistakes will \nbe made.\n\n[[Page S11305]]\n\n  In a real sense, we are analogous to, say, 1946. America had just \nbeaten the Germans and the Japanese. The average American said let's \nforget about the world and put our feet up on the coffee table and \nenjoy our fruits of our labor here at home. All of a sudden, there was \na large Communist monolith looking over our shoulder. Initially, we \ndidn't know how to react, and we made mistakes along the way--\nMcCarthyism and Vietnam--but eventually we triumphed over communism. I \nam not sure the war on terrorism will take us that long to triumph. It \nmay be 20, 30 or 15 years, but it will not take 2 or 3 years.\n  We are going to have to be vigilant to the memory of those who were \nlost, to those who suffered. To rise to the greatness of this Nation, \nwe are going to have to be vigilant and remember that no one has all \nthe answers and we will make mistakes, but we will prevail provided we \nkeep our resolve, which I believe we will. Yes, it has changed us. But \nErnest Hemmingway once wrote that the world breaks us in certain places \nand we grow back stronger over the breaks. Hopefully, that will happen \nhere. I believe it is happening here. We are learning, we are adapting, \nand we will triumph.\n  So we say to those evil people halfway around the world, who did what \nthey did on that day 2 years minus 1 day ago, you messed with the wrong \ncity, you messed with the wrong country, and you will pay a price. We \nwill not let you and your evil message prevail.\n  So it is 2 years now. In some ways, it seems like yesterday. In some \nways, it seems like a lifetime. We will remember those who were lost. \nOur city will maintain and even achieve greater greatness, and our \ncountry will prevail over terrorism. God bless those families who still \nsuffer. God bless our city and State, and God bless America.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/10/senate-section/article/S11305-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11305]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           GENERAL RAY DAVIS\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, I rise to pay tribute to the life of \na great American hero and great Georgian. GEN Ray Davis passed away \nlast week at the age of 88. Many will remember General Davis for his \nlegacy of service, honor, and heroism. Most will remember General Davis \nas one of the most decorated marines in our Nation's history. I will \nremember him as a man of deep conviction who had a genuine concern for \nhis family, community, and country, but mostly, I will remember him as \nmy friend.\n  President Truman awarded General Davis the Medal of Honor, the \nhighest honor a soldier can receive, after the Korean War for his \nextraordinary heroism during the 1st Marine Division's historic battle \nof the Chosin Reservoir in North Korea. His leadership there secured a \nmountain pass, enabling the escape of two marine regiments that had \nbeen trapped for 5 days. To reach the regiments, then Lieutenant \nColonel Davis led his men through the mountains in subzero temperatures \nthrough the night, battling vastly superior numbers, to eventually \ndefeat the Chinese the next morning. The remaining epic 14-mile \nfighting march lasted 3 days.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the full text of \nGeneral Davis's Medal of Honor citation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          Korean War Medal of Honor Recipient Raymond G. Davis\n\n       Rank and organization: Lieutenant Colonel, U.S. Marine \n     Corps commanding officer, 1st Battalion, 7th Marines, 1st \n     Marine Division (Rein.). Place and date: Vicinity Hagaru-ri, \n     Korea, 1 through 4 December 1950. Entered service at: \n     Atlanta, Ga. Born: 13 January 1915, Fitzgerald, Ga. Citation: \n     For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his \n     life above and beyond the call of duty as commanding officer \n     of the 1st Battalion, in action against enemy aggressor \n     forces. Although keenly aware that the operation involved \n     breaking through a surrounding enemy and advancing 8 miles \n     along primitive icy trails in the bitter cold with every \n     passage disputed by a savage and determined foe, Lt. Col. \n     Davis boldly led his battalion into the attack in a daring \n     attempt to relieve a beleaguered rifle company and to seize, \n     hold, and defend a vital mountain pass controlling the only \n     route available for 2 marine regiments in danger of being cut \n     off by numerically superior hostile forces during their re-\n     deployment to the port of Hungnam. when the battalion \n     immediately encountered strong opposition from entrenched \n     enemy forces commanding high ground in the path of the \n     advance, he promptly spearheaded his unit in a fierce attack \n     up the steep, ice-covered slopes in the face of withering \n     fire and, personally leading the assault groups in a hand-to-\n     hand encounter, drove the hostile troops from their \n     positions, rested his men, and reconnoitered the area under \n     enemy fire to determine the best route for continuing the \n     mission. Always in the thick of the fighting Lt. Col. Davis \n     led his battalion over 3 successive ridges in the deep snow \n     in continuous attacks against the enemy and, constantly \n     inspiring and encouraging his men throughout the night, \n     brought his unit to a point within 1,500 yards of the \n     surrounded rifle company by daybreak. Although knocked to the \n     ground when a shell fragment struck his helmet and 2 bullets \n     pierced his clothing, he arose and fought his way forward at \n     the head of his men until he reached the isolated marines. On \n     the following morning, he bravely led his battalion in \n     securing the vital mountain pass from a strongly entrenched \n     and numerically superior hostile force, carrying all his \n     wounded with him, including 22 litter cases and numerous \n     ambulatory patients. Despite repeated savage and heavy \n     assaults by the enemy, he stubbornly held the vital terrain \n     until the 2 regiments of the division had deployed through \n     the pass and, on the morning of 4 December, led his battalion \n     into Hagaru-ri intact. By his superb leadership, outstanding \n     courage, and brilliant tactical ability, Lt. Col. Davis was \n     directly instrumental in saving the beleaguered rifle company \n     from complete annihilation and enabled the 2 marine regiments \n     to escape possible destruction. His valiant devotion to duty \n     and unyielding fighting spirit in the face of almost \n     insurmountable adds enhance and sustain the highest \n     traditions of the U.S. Naval Service.\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. After the Korean War, General Davis went on to command \nthe 3rd Marine Division in Vietnam. In 1972 he retired as a four-star \ngeneral, having served his country for 33 years. During his service, \nGeneral Davis earned a Purple Heart, a Bronze Star, two Legions of \nMerit, two Silver Stars, two Distinguished Service Medals, the Navy \nCross for his service in the Palua Islands operation, as well as the \nMedal of Honor.\n  As an anecdote, our current chairman of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, Senator John Warner, told me the other day that when he was \nSecretary of the Navy, he was responsible for seeing to the promotion \nof General Davis to full general.\n  After his retirement he refused to fade from the scene and his \ntireless efforts on behalf of veterans nationwide led to the \nconstruction of the Korean War Memorial here in Washington, DC. General \nDavis made it a practice of keeping in touch with me with respect to \nissues regarding the Active Force as well as veterans on a regular \nbasis.\n  I noticed in my faxes I received last week that on the day before he \ndied, he sent me a letter with an op ed he had written regarding a \nparticular issue our Senate Armed Services Committee is dealing with on \nthis very day.\n  General Davis has been a constant source of encouragement and support \nto me over the years. I will miss him dearly. He is survived by his \nwife of 61 years, Willa Knox Davis, three children, seven \ngrandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.\n  We who knew him have been blessed by his wisdom, humility, and, above \nall, his honor. Our thoughts and prayers will remain with his family as \nthey remember and celebrate the extraordinary life of GEN Ray Davis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/10/senate-section/article/S11305-2", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11305-S11306]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                MEDICARE\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I wish to talk about cancer as \nwell as finalize details of this appropriations bill which includes \nmore than $5 billion for the Cancer Institute. I am reminded of a \nrelated issue that threatens cancer care in this country. I am \nextremely concerned with several provisions in the Medicare \nprescription drug coverage bill already passed by the Senate and the \nHouse.\n  As we know, when the Medicare Program was first enacted, much of the \ncare provided to patients was delivered in the hospital inpatient \nsetting. That was 1965 when Medicare was enacted.\n  Over the course of the next 37 years, as science and medicine has \nprogressed, patient care has shifted dramatically to the physician's \noffice. Perhaps nowhere has this shift been more prevalent than in \ncancer care. Today, over 80 percent of all care is delivered in \nphysicians' offices, and that is cancer care. This is due in large part \nto the introduction of the new outpatient drugs which have \nsignificantly reduced the need for inpatient hospital care for cancer \npatients.\n\n[[Page S11306]]\n\n  If Congress was designing the Medicare Program today, in 2003, \ninstead of in 1965, there is little doubt that outpatient prescription \ndrug coverage would be a central part of that program. That is a lot of \nthe argument we made when we passed the prescription drug benefit, a \nbill that passed earlier in the summer.\n  The current Medicare system, however, only provides limited coverage \nfor outpatient drugs. Clearly, that needs to change, especially for \ncancer care.\n  Medicare does provide coverage for many cancer drugs, such as \nchemotherapeutic agents and supportive drugs. In addition, Medicare \nprovides reimbursement to physician practices for professional services \nassociated with the administration of those covered drugs under \nMedicare. As has been noted by the General Accounting Office and the \nHHS inspector general, the current system for reimbursement of cancer \ncare is seriously flawed.\n  Medicare payments for cancer drugs frequently exceed the cost to the \nproviders, and at the same time, however, Medicare reimbursement for \ndrug administration covers only a small fraction of the actual cost of \nproviding quality cancer care.\n  It is estimated that the current Medicare reimbursement only covers \nabout 20 percent of the actual practice expenses.\n  I have heard from many of Florida's 775 oncologists, and they have \ntold me that the overpayment for covered drugs has helped make up for \nthe significant underpayment in practice expenses incurred by \nphysicians' offices. This includes expenses for oncology nurses, \npharmacists, case managers, medical equipment, and other services and \nsupplies involved in providing cancer patients with the highest quality \nof care.\n  The goal for reform ought to be simple. Medicare should neither \noverpay nor underpay for drugs and related expenses. Unfortunately, the \nlegislation passed by both Houses does not achieve the balanced reform \nthat I think all of us agree is needed.\n  Instead, the legislation passed by the Senate on prescription drugs \ncalls for a cut of $16 billion over the next 10 years. The House-passed \nbill is no better, and it includes a cut of over $13 billion from the \ncurrent Medicare reimbursement levels.\n  The consequences from cuts of this magnitude are going to be \ndramatic, including the closure of satellite clinics in rural areas, \nforcing cancer patients to drive hundreds of miles for treatments. \nOncology nurses, pharmacists, social workers, and the like will lose \ntheir jobs. Clinical research in community-based clinics, where \napproximately 60 percent of all cancer clinical trials are conducted \ntoday, are going to be brought to a halt. Many doctors will be forced \nto significantly reduce the number of Medicare cancer patients they \ntreat, while others will stop accepting new cancer patients altogether.\n  Patients are going to be forced to seek treatment elsewhere, but \nhospitals have indicated they have neither the physical capacity nor \nthe nursing staff to treat a large volume of new cancer patients. In \nfact, a recent survey conducted by the American Society of Clinical \nOncology found that if the proposed cuts in Medicare reimbursement are \nenacted into law, 73 percent of physicians surveyed would send \nchemotherapy patients to a hospital instead of treating them in the \noffice. Fifty-three percent would limit the number of Medicare patients \nthey treat, and nearly one in five indicated they would stop treating \nMedicare patients entirely.\n  If that happens, it is exactly the opposite of what we ought to be \ndoing, because a person can keep their costs a lot lower if they are \ndoing this treatment in a doctor's office instead of doing it in the \nhospital.\n  I am sure all of us unanimously would agree that we cannot let this \nhappen, especially at a time when such tremendous progress is being \nmade in cancer research and treatment. Yet it is happening under our \neyes. It happened in this bill that we passed.\n  According to the statistics from the American Cancer Society, \napproximately 1.3 million new cancer cases will be diagnosed this year, \nand 60 percent of those cases will be among Medicare beneficiaries.\n  In my home State, more than a million people will be told over the \nnext decade that they have been diagnosed with cancer. If the $16 \nbillion of cuts in cancer care that have been proposed are enacted into \nlaw, this would mean a $1.6 billion reduction in Medicare cancer care \nreimbursement in my State of Florida alone. This cut is second only to \nthe cut in California, which would be hit with a $1.7 billion cut.\n  Let's face it, cuts of this magnitude are not sustainable. This is \njust Medicare reimbursement that we are talking about because private \npayers frequently follow the Medicare payment formulas. In the private \nsector, those cuts will be even more dramatic. The cumulative effect of \nall of these proposed Medicare cuts, combined with the private payer \ncuts that will undoubtedly follow, will have a very serious impact on \nthe ability of cancer patients to receive the care they need in order \nto survive.\n  I remind everybody that there is not one among us who has not been \ntouched by cancer in some way, if not among ourselves, among our loved \nones and our friends. We have the greatest system of cancer care in the \nworld. Patients are living longer. They are living productive lives \nthanks to the scientific advances and the dedicated men and women who \nprovide the high-quality care in convenient and cost-effective \ncommunity clinics throughout this country. People from around the world \ntravel to America for cancer care.\n\n  My colleagues ought to see the Latin American market, how it comes to \nFlorida for that care, because they know we have the latest \ntechnologies, the best doctors, the most compassionate nurses, and the \nbest trained medical workforce in the world. That is why people come to \nthe United States for their health care, especially cancer care.\n  Advances in cancer research have led to the development of new \ntherapies that are more targeted, and those therapies are less toxic. \nAs a result, cancer mortality rates in the U.S. have been declining. We \nare winning this war on cancer. Now is not the time to call for a \nretreat, a surrender, by slashing Medicare payments.\n  The conference committee on the Medicare prescription drug bill is \nmeeting right now, and all across this land people who care about what \nI am trying to articulate ought to be sending their ideas, their \nrequests, and their pleas, along with their prayers, to that conference \ncommittee and let them know what they think. We have a saying in the \nSouth: Let them have an earful.\n  While many issues still have to be ironed out in that conference \ncommittee, it is putting the Congress one step closer to enacting the \nmost sweeping reform of the Medicare Program since its inception.\n  In closing, I urge my colleagues to continue the discussions with the \ncancer care community to develop a proposal that will preserve patient \naccess to community-based cancer care. Cancer patients and their \nfamilies are counting on Congress to preserve high-quality community-\nbased cancer care. This is one of the most serious issues we are \nfacing, and when we make tradeoffs because of budgetary limitations, as \nwe did on the floor of this Senate in the consideration of the Medicare \nprescription drug benefit, where we traded cuts in cancer care for \nincreases in rural health care, that is a tradeoff that we should not \nhave to make. We ought to be able to do both. The consequences, if we \nallow it to stand, are going to be extremely great.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/10/senate-section/article/S11306-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11306-S11315]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 CANCER\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, increasing scientific evidence indicates \nthat what a person includes in his or her diet may be as important as \nwhat a person excludes. Scientists estimate that at least 30 to 40 \npercent of all cancers are linked to diet and related lifestyle \nfactors.\n  Some foods contain substances known to increase the risk of cancer, \nincluding saturated fat, cholesterol, and oxidants.\n  Avoiding these foods may reduce the risk of many of the most common \nforms of cancer, including prostate cancer, breast cancer, and colon \ncancer. I happen to have an extreme interest in that because I am a \nprostate cancer survivor. I am now told other foods\n\n[[Page S11307]]\n\ncontain substances that help protect against cancer and heart disease.\n  A growing number of compounds in fruits, vegetables, and cereal \ngrains have been found to interfere with the process of cancer \ndevelopment in laboratory research.\n  Epidemiologists have found that populations that consume large \namounts of plant-derived foods have lower incidence rates of some types \nof cancer.\n  According to a study conducted by Stephanie London, a doctor and \nepidemiologist at the National Institutes of Environmental Health \nSciences and Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, broccoli and other \nmembers of the cruciferous vegetable family, including cabbage and bok \nchoy, appear to protect humans from lung cancer.\n  Several other studies have pointed to the cancer-prevention \nproperties of phytochemicals found in these vegetables. According to \nHien T. Le, Ph.D., a molecular biologist with the University of \nCalifornia Berkeley, consumption of these cruciferous vegetables has \nbeen linked with prevention of cancers of the breast, endometrium, \ncolon, and prostate cancer.\n  One study further found these chemicals are ``novel,'' naturally \noccurring and could have potential in cancer prevention or treatment.\n  Broccoli and related vegetables contain the chemical that kills the \nbacteria responsible for most stomach cancers, say researchers, \nconfirming the dietary advice that moms have been handing out for \nyears. Dr. Paul Talalay, a coresearcher at Johns Hopkins University, \nfound the chemical sulforaphane even killed H. pylori, a bacteria that \ncauses stomach ulcers and often fatal stomach cancers. Researchers \nstated:\n\n       If clinical studies show that a food can relieve or prevent \n     disease associated with this bacterium in people, it could \n     have a significant public health implication in the United \n     States and around the world.\n\n  The good news is there appears to be enough of this chemical in \nbroccoli sprouts and some varieties of broccoli to significantly \nbenefit people who eat them. However, researchers cannot now say how \nmuch broccoli one should eat for there to be such an impact. The actual \namounts would need to be determined with long-term tests involving \nhuman trials. ``The levels at which we test it . . . is such that those \ncould be achieved by eating broccoli or broccoli sprouts. It's a \nreasonable level that we think would be reached in the stomach,'' said \nJed W. Fahey, of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.\n  Researchers have created a synthetic version of the compound found in \nbroccoli and other vegetables. ``It may be easier to take a cancer \nprevention pill once a day rather than rely on massive quantities of \nfruits and vegetables,'' says the study author, Jerome Kosmeder, \nanother Ph.D. research assistant professor at the University of \nIllinois at Chicago. However, such drug development is several years \naway, I am informed.\n  The reason for my statement today is that I recently met with Dean \nOrnish, a great friend, a medical doctor, founder and president of the \nPreventive Medicine Research Institute, and clinical professor of \nmedicine at the University of California, San Francisco. According to \nDr. Ornish, ``We often have had a hard time believing that the simple \nchoices we make in our life each day--what we eat, how we respond to \nstress, how much exercise we get, whether or not we smoke, and the \nquality of our relationships--have such a powerful impact on our health \nand well-being.''\n  With Dr. Ornish was Dr. S. Ward Casscells, a medical doctor who is \nthe John Edward Tyson Distinguished Professor of Medicine and Public \nHealth and vice president for biotechnology at the University of Texas \nHealth Center in Houston.\n  Dr. Casscells was diagnosed with very aggressive metastatic prostate \ncancer in July of 2001. He began utilizing diet and a lifestyle program \nthat Dr. Ornish and his colleagues had developed, along with \nconventional drug treatment. Today, Dr. Casscells shows no sign of \ncancer. He shows no sign at all of a cancer that had metastasized.\n  Meanwhile, researchers say populations should continue to eat healthy \namounts of fruits and vegetables, enabling them to take advantage of \ncancer-fighting properties. Several other studies have pointed to the \ncancer prevention properties of the phytochemicals found in vegetables, \naccording to several other people.\n  Mr. President, I emphasize, because of the nature of some of the \nmoneys in this bill--I do believe we have spent a lot of Federal-tax \npayers' money on various approaches to cancer--I think we should \nconcentrate more of the money we have available on these methods of \nprevention and methods of retarding the development of cancer once \ndiscovered.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I alert all Senators as to our schedule. \nI have had a number of inquiries as to what we will be doing. There are \nvery few amendments remaining to be voted upon. Unless we are going to \nhave a series of rollcall votes on amendments which the managers have \nagreed to, the senior Senator from Arizona has notified this manager \nthere are objections to amendments.\n  At this time I ask unanimous consent to offer an amendment by Senator \nSessions regarding the Centers for Disease Control on a plan related to \nblood safety and ask for its immediate adoption. The provision of the \namendment is ``not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of \nthis act, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention shall prepare a plan to comprehensively address blood safety \nand injection safety in Africa under the global AIDS program.''\n  The area of disagreement, if I may inform my colleagues, is whether \nthe word ``shall'' will be in the amendment, which is what Senator \nSessions insists upon, or whether it will be ``may,'' which would leave \nit up to the discretion of the executive branch as to whether they will \ncarry out the study.\n  If the yeas and nays are requested, I intend to ask my colleagues to \ndeny a sufficient second. I have consulted with the Parliamentarian who \nadvises that the rule is, to have a sufficient second, there must be \none-fifth of those who\n\n[[Page S11308]]\n\npreviously voted, which would be 19 out of 95. If this will require a \nrollcall vote, I cannot predict how many rollcall votes we will have \nthis evening, but I would not make dinner plans.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Regular order.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for the adoption \nof the Sessions amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Is the amendment debateable?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The regular order is there are 2 minutes \nevenly divided prior to a vote with respect to the Landrieu amendment \nNo. 1614.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I am glad to have a quorum. This is a \nvery important amendment. I need my colleagues' help, if they would \ndirect their attention to this chart I have in the Chamber.\n  This amendment is called the MASH amendment. It is a very serious \namendment: mosquito abatement, safety, and health.\n  We are fighting multiple wars--one in Iraq, which is very serious, \nwith far-reaching consequences.\n  I know my colleagues are interested in knowing about how many people \nhave lost their lives in their own States in this last year. It has \nbeen quite a few from this new and very deadly disease.\n  We have lost 286 men and women in Iraq, which is very serious, and we \nare spending a great deal of time, energy, money, and treasure, but we \nhave also lost 246 individuals in the United States. The highest \ninstances have been in Louisiana, South Dakota, Michigan, and Ohio.\n  This amendment will provide the only Federal funds available to help \nour States combat this deadly disease. I ask for your support. I ask \nunanimous consent to have printed in the Record data on the number of \nconfirmed cases of people who have contracted this deadly disease and \nthe number of people who have died from it.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   WEST NILE VIRUS CURRENT CASE COUNT\n         [Data currently listed shows case counts for 2002 only]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                  Laboratory-\n                      State                         positive     Deaths\n                                                  human cases\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAlabama.........................................           49          3\nArkansas........................................           43          3\nCalifornia......................................            1\nColorado........................................           14\nConnecticut.....................................           17\nDelaware........................................            1\nDistrict of Columbia............................           34          1\nFlorida.........................................           28          2\nGeorgia.........................................           44          7\nIllinois........................................          884         64\nIndiana.........................................          293         11\nIowa............................................           54          2\nKansas..........................................           22\nKentucky........................................           75          5\nLouisiana.......................................          329         25\nMaryland........................................           36          7\nMassachusetts...................................           23          3\nMichigan........................................          614         51\nMinnesota.......................................           48\nMississippi.....................................          192         12\nMissouri........................................          168          7\nMontana.........................................            2\nNebraska........................................          152          7\nNew Jersey......................................           24\nNew York........................................           82          5\nNorth Carolina..................................            2\nNorth Dakota....................................           17          2\nOhio............................................          441         31\nOklahoma........................................           21          2\nPennsylvania....................................           62          7\nRhode Island....................................            1\nSouth Carolina..................................            1\nSouth Dakota....................................           37\nTennessee.......................................           56          7\nTexas...........................................          202         13\nVermont.........................................            1\nVirginia........................................           29          2\nWest Virginia...................................            3          2\nWisconsin.......................................           52          3\nWyoming.........................................            2\n                                                 -----------------------\n      Totals....................................        4,156        284\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ Data currently listed shows case counts for 2002 only.

Mr. President, I believe we are ready to go to the \namendment of the Senator from Nevada, Mr. Ensign. He was in the Chamber \na moment ago. Let me advise all Senators that it appears at this time \nthat we will have four more rollcall votes, plus final passage.\n  The leader has authorized me to say that the 15-minute votes will be \nheld sharp to 20 minutes, 15 and 5 grace, cut off after 20 minutes. The \n10-minute votes will be 10 plus 5 minutes grace for a total of 15 \nminutes. We will try to proceed to conclude this bill. It is too late \nto complete it early, but we will do it as soon as we can.\n  Is the Senator from Nevada prepared to offer his amendment.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Very soon.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1621 To Amendment No. 1542\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendments are \nset aside.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Ensign], for himself, Mrs. \n     Murray, and Mr. Gregg, proposes an amendment numbered 1621 to \n     amendment No. 1542.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide funding for statewide, longitudinal data systems \n    under section 208 of the Education Sciences Reform Act of 2002)\n\n       At the end of title III, insert the following:\n       Sec. 306. There are appropriated, out of any money in the \n     Treasury not otherwise appropriated, to carry out section 208 \n     of the Education Sciences Reform Act of 2002, $80,000,000. \n     All amounts in this Act for management and administration at \n     the Department of Education are reduced on a pro rata basis \n     by an amount required to offset the $80,000,000 appropriation \n     made by this section.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I will take a very short time on this \namendment. I am proposing this amendment for myself, Senator Murray, \nand Senator Gregg. This amendment is to address a problem we hear about \nback home on the No Child Left Behind Act. When you go home and talk to \neducators, they talk about not having adequate money to get the \ntechnology to transfer the data to comply with the No Child Left Behind \nAct for the local school districts. It is the No. 1 complaint we have \nheard from all of the school districts back home.\n  This amendment appropriates $80 million to basically fund that \nshortfall, and it takes the money out of administrative costs in the \nDepartment of Education. We think it is a very reasonable amendment. We \nhope our colleagues will support the amendment. Hearing from educators \nacross the country, this will address one of the most pressing concerns \nthey have in complying with the No Child Left Behind Act.\n  I just spoke to the new teachers in Clark County. They had to break \nit down into 2 days, with 700 one day and 700 the next for new teacher \norientation. During that time, there were a lot of administrators \naround, and this was by far the biggest question they had--making sure \nthey had adequate funds to comply with the No Child Left Behind Act. We \nthink this amendment goes a long way toward complying with the No Child \nLeft Behind Act.\n  I will yield to my friend from New Hampshire to make some remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise in support of this amendment. It is \npaid for, which is a critical element of any amendment. More important \nthan that, it does fund the data-tracking capabilities of the States. \nThat is part of the No Child Left Behind initiative.\n  Last year, we passed the legislation, basically creating this \nopportunity for States to set up these databases. Unfortunately, we \nnever funded it. So this would allow us to fund that new piece of \nlegislation. I think it was a separate freestanding piece of \nlegislation.\n  In any event, it funds the effort of the States to set up the data \ntracking within the States that is necessary for them to determine how \nthey are doing in obtaining their achievement goals under No Child Left \nBehind. It is reasonable that this money be appropriated, and I am \nhopeful that it will be accepted. If it cannot be accepted, I hope we \ncan do it by the offsets presented in this amendment.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, if no one else seeks recognition, I just \nadd a couple of comments about the amendment. It has the support of the \nCouncil of Chief State School Officers. The reason, as I mentioned \nbefore, is because no matter how small or large the school district is, \nthey are all facing the same problems this amendment attempts to \ncorrect.\n  They just do not have the infrastructure that is necessary to \ncapture, analyze, and disseminate the data required by the No Child \nLeft Behind Act.\n  Several States have not even done the planning to implement this \nbecause they don't have the resources. This amendment is going to give \nthose resources necessary to comply with the No Child Left Behind Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this amendment provides $80 million for \ndata collection for student achievement. While it would be desirable to \nhave more funds in this appropriations bill, we don't have them, and \nthe offset is a cut in the program out of the Department of Education \nwhich would be very burdensome, really intolerable for the Department \nof Education.\n  For that reason, I reluctantly oppose the amendment by the Senator \nfrom Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senator from Washington, Mrs. Murray, \nwishes to speak on the amendment, so I ask that the vote not occur at \nthis time. She is on her way over to the Chamber.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside until Senator Murray arrives.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1622 to Amendment No. 1542\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Specter], for himself, \n     Mr. Harkin, Mrs. Feinstein, and Ms. Collins, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1622 to amendment No. 1542.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To increase funding for the National Institutes of Health)\n\n       On page 61, between lines 14 and 15, insert the following:\n       Sec. __. In addition to any amounts otherwise appropriated \n     under this Act under the heading of National Institutes of \n     Health--office of the director, there are appropriated an \n     additional $1,500,000,000 for programs and activities under \n     the discretion of the Office of the Director of the National \n     Institutes of Health. Such additional amount shall be \n     designated as emergency spending\n\n[[Page S11310]]\n\n     pursuant to section 502(c) of House Concurrent Resolution 95 \n     (108th Congress).\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the amendment provides for an additional \n$1.5 billion for the National Institutes of Health. This is one of the \nmost important functions of the Federal Government. I don't think we \nhave anything in our budget on the domestic side which is more \nimportant, perhaps not as important, as funding for the National \nInstitutes of Health. That is the crown jewel of the Federal \nGovernment.\n  We are asking that this be classified as an emergency because the \nbudget resolution provides for an emergency classification if it meets \nthe following criteria: No. 1, vital; No. 2, urgent and compelling; No. \n3, unpredictable; and No. 4, temporary.\n  It is vital because the lives and health of Americans are at stake. \nIt is a life-and-death matter in the way NIH funding has saved lives, \nmoving forward the cures of so many dreadful maladies.\n  It is urgent and compelling because Americans who have family members \nwith muscular dystrophy, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, or a host of other \nailments will tell you that with each passing day, the hope that their \nloved one will be saved grows dimmer.\n  It is unpredictable and unanticipated because the nature of the \nscientific enterprise is unpredictable. The potential cures for disease \nhave grown through research at NIH.\n  It is temporary because a disease such as cancer or Alzheimer's costs \nour economy billions of dollars a year.\n  As the diseases that afflict Americans are cured, they are able to \nreturn to productive lives, and these investments in the health of \nAmericans will more than pay for themselves.\n  I offer this amendment on behalf of Senator Harkin, Senator \nFeinstein, Senator Collins, and myself. I know there are objections to \nthe classification as an emergency. So I invite whoever seeks to object \nto come to the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Does the Senator yield the floor?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, again I commend Senator Specter for his \nmany years of hard work, his efforts, and his success in increasing the \nfunding for the crown jewel of the Federal Government, and that is the \nNational Institutes of Health. Certainly, no one has fought harder and \nlonger to ensure that our National Institutes of Health get the funding \nthey need for the cutting-edge research that is saving so many lives.\n  It was under Senator Specter's leadership that we embarked upon a \nprogram to double the NIH funding over 5 years. People said it could \nnot be done, but we did it.\n  Now we are up there and there seems to be some idea that somehow \nsince we did that--the reason we did that was that NIH had fallen so \nfar behind in the number of peer-reviewed grants that were being \napproved and funded. So we got them back up to where they were at least \n20 years ago. Some think now we have them up there, we do not have to \nfund them anymore and we can start falling back again. The purpose of \nthe Specter amendment is to bring the NIH up and keep them on a track \nthat will not allow them to fall back again.\n  The Senate bill will increase funding for NIH by $1 billion; that is \n3.7 percent. It will be the smallest percentage increase for NIH since \n1995. This is the wrong time to put the squeeze on NIH funding. Doing \nso will severely impact NIH's ability to award new research grants at \nthe very time when scientists should be taking full advantage of \neverything they have learned over the past 5 years to translate that \nresearch into treatments and cures.\n  Under the Senate bill, the number of new and competing nonbiodefense \nresearch grants would actually drop from 9,902 in fiscal year 2003 to \n9,827 in fiscal year 2004. That is why Senator Specter, Senator \nFeinstein, Senator Collins, and I are offering an amendment to add $1.5 \nbillion more for NIH.\n  This additional funding is critical to ensuring that researchers can \ncontinue the remarkable pace of medical advances during the past 5 \nyears, as I said, when we doubled the funding for NIH. Perhaps most \nimportantly, the doubling of the funding helped result in the \ncompletion of the final DNA sequence of the human genome. That was done \nduring that period of time.\n  In the past 5 years, NIH research has led directly to new knowledge \nabout the dangers of hormone replacement therapy for millions of \nAmerican women, contradicting commonly accepted medical practice.\n  NIH research supported the development of new techniques for bone \nmarrow transplantation.\n  NIH research demonstrated that intense therapy of type 1 diabetes can \nreduce long-term diabetes complications by at least 75 percent.\n  NIH research has now enabled scientists to identify several genes \nthat increase vulnerability to schizophrenia.\n  I guess what I am saying is we are truly on the brink of a golden age \nin medical research with the mapping and sequencing of the human genes \nand other measures funded by NIH. But those opportunities are \nthreatened if we don't maintain NIH funding at a reasonable level.\n  The impact of the bill's dramatic slowing in the growth of the NIH \nbudget will be particularly devastating in the areas of clinical \nresearch where, again, the fruits of our investment in medical research \nare applied to improving the health of the American people.\n  A crash landing in NIH funding sends a chilling message to young \nscientists in training and those just entering the research field. \nScientific competition will always be fierce, but young scientists must \nbe sure that sufficient funding will be available or exceptionally \ntalented young people will begin to pursue other careers.\n  So again I rise in strong support of Senator Specter's amendment, \nalong with Senator Feinstein, and I hope the Senate will adopt this \nvery modest but very meaningful increase in funding for the National \nInstitutes of Health.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise as a cosponsor of the Specter-\nHarkin-Feinstein amendment to increase funding for the National \nInstitutes of Health, NIH. I fought hard to make sure that Congress \nkept the commitment it made 5 years ago to double Federal spending for \nthe NIH. I am proud that Congress kept its promise. I strongly support \nthe NIH. I believe that it is an investment that saves lives and that \nCongress must continue this valuable investment.\n  The underlying Senate bill that funds health programs would increase \nfunding for NIH by $1 billion, or just 3.7 percent in 2004. This would \nbe the smallest percentage increase for NIH since 1995. The Specter-\nHarkins-Feinstein amendment would increase funding by $1.5 billion, for \na total of $29.5 billion. this is the wrong time to cut the Federal \ninvestment in NIH. Congress and the American people have invested in \nthe NIH. We must allow scientists to continue the great work they are \ndoing and translate the research they have been working on over the \npast 5 years into treatments and cures.\n  If this amendment fails there would be in increase of only 26 new and \ncompeting research grants in fiscal year 2004. That is approximately \none grant for each NIH Institute and Center. Also, nonbiodefense grants \nwould actually drop, from 9,902 in fiscal year 2003 to 9,607 in fiscal \nyear 2004. This means that more promising research on cancer, diabetes, \nor other devastating diseases may go unfunded.\n  The research conducted at NIH today can help lead to longer, more \nproductive lives for people struck with countless conditions and \ndiseases. Whether it is Alzheimer's, cancer, cardiovascular disease, \nautoimmune diseases, or diabetes, this research can help lead to a \nhigher quality of life for Americans.\n  I am proud to have NIH in Maryland. NIH's impact in Maryland is quite \nprofound. We have excellent research centers and private companies that \nexist and grow because of the unique synergy between the Federal labs \nin Maryland, like NIH, and the ingenuity of the private sector. Yet the \nbenefits of investing in NIH are not limited to Maryland. NIH funds \nresearch at universities across the country. Patients across the \ncountry, their loved ones, and those who someday may be diagnosed with \ndiseases all benefit from these critical investments.\n  We cannot afford to lessen our commitment to medical research. I \nthank Senator Specter, Senator Harkin and\n\n[[Page S11311]]\n\nSenator Feinstein for their leadership on this critical issue. I urge \nmy colleagues to join me in supporting this important bipartisan \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, we have two more amendments to be offered \nby the Senator from Pennsylvania, Senator Santorum, and the Senator \nfrom Ohio, Senator DeWine. We ask they come to the floor now. If there \nare objections to the amendment which has just been offered on the \nNational Institutes of Health, we ask Senators to come to the floor so \nwe can wrap up the debate, move on these votes, and move to final \npassage.\n  We are within the very short distance of the goal line, but we need \nthose other Senators to come to the floor. Last Wednesday we were \ntalking about going to third reading. That might be a subject to \nrevisit.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Collins be added as \na cosponsor to amendment No. 1621.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, we have decided to accept the amendment \nof the Senator from Nevada, Mr. Ensign. Does the ranking member concur \nin that?\n  Mr. HARKIN. We have no objections on this side.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I ask unanimous consent that the yeas and nays be \nvitiated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 1621.\n  The amendment (No. 1621) was agreed to.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. While we are waiting momentarily, I want to take this \nopportunity to recognize the staff of the Labor, Health and Human \nServices, and Education Subcommittee for all their efforts, hard work, \nand dedication on this very difficult bill.\n  First let me thank Senator Harkin's staff: Ellen Murray, Erik Fatemi, \nand Adrienne Hallet. They have worked shoulder to shoulder in a \nbipartisan fashion with our staff to put together this fine bill. It is \na testament to their hard work, skill, dedication, and partnership.\n  I also commend and thank our subcommittee staff: Jim Sourwine, Mark \nLaisch, Sudip Parikh, Candice Rogers, and Carol Geagley. The staff \ndeserves our gratitude for working diligently for many months, late \nnights, and weekends to put together this very important bill. I know \nevery year both of these staffs reach across the aisle to work together \nto forge compromises on many contentious issues. I think we should all \nthank them and salute them.\n  Lastly, I will take a moment to give special praise to our \nsubcommittee staff director Bettilou Taylor. Senator Specter and I \noften refer to Bettilou as ``Senator Taylor.'' She has one of the \ntoughest jobs in the Senate. This is the largest bill this year. It \nprobably is the largest domestic appropriations bill in the history of \nthe United States to appropriate taxpayer money for Federal purposes. \nThis is a very complex bill with difficult issues. Bettilou does it \nwith a great deal of skill and grace. She is, in every sense of the \nword, a consummate professional. I thank her and I hope all Members \nwill thank her for her outstanding work for the Senate and for the \nAmerican people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished President pro \ntempore and chairman of the full committee for those comments. I \nassociate myself with them. It has been an outstanding and \nextraordinary staff. Ellen Murray for Senator Harkin and Bettilou \nTaylor on the majority side are--exemplary is not a high enough \ncharacterization.\n  While I am at it, I thank my distinguished ranking member, Senator \nHarkin, for his extraordinary contribution to the public good. He and I \nhave worked as the chairman and ranking and reversed the roles, and we \ncall it a seamless transfer of the gavel. I take this occasion to thank \nhim for his work.\n  I note Senator Nickles is in Chamber now, so I yield for a moment to \nmy colleague, Senator Harkin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the chairman for yielding and I, too, thank \nSenator Stevens for his kind and generous remarks regarding the \nsubcommittee and especially applaud him for all the glowing terms he \nused about our staff on both sides of the aisle. They are just \noutstanding staff. They work very hard on this bill every year. But \nthey have not worked any harder in any year than this year because, as \nChairman Stevens said, this is a very large bill and a very complicated \nbill. It covers just about everything from soup to nuts in our society.\n  They have done a great job. I, too, compliment our respective staffs \nand thank them for all their hard work. I want to repay in kind the \nkind words Senator Specter just said. We have had a back and forth \nchairmanship/ranking member now going back 13 years. It has been a \nseamless transfer of the gavel. We worked very closely together all \nthese years to increase funding for NIH, to meet our commitments in \neducation, to meet our commitments in health care.\n  This bill, I have often said, is the bill that really defines \nAmerica. I have often said that we always have a Defense Appropriations \nCommittee bill. The Defense Appropriations Committee bill is the bill \nthat defends America. This bill that funds the Department of Education \nthat our colleague from Tennessee headed--I remember when he was \nSecretary of Education--and the Department of Health and Human \nServices, the Department of Labor, NIH, libraries--everything, I always \nsaid this is the bill that defines America. It defines who we are as a \npeople and how much we are going to invest in our human resources in \nthis country.\n  So I thank Senator Specter for his dynamic leadership of this \nsubcommittee, for his vision, for his hard work in making sure we have \na bill that is--not perfect. Obviously, I don't think anyone here has \ngotten everything they want out of this bill; that is true. But it is a \ntrue compromise, and that is what should define what we do here in the \nSenate, is compromise between the various interests we represent and \nthe various States. I think that is truly what this bill does this \nyear, and I thank Senator Specter for his great leadership getting this \nbill together.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I regret I am going to make a budget \npoint of order because the amendment that is pending busts the budget, \nand it busts the budget by $1.5 billion.\n  First, I congratulate Senator Specter for the work he has done up to \nthis point. He saved the taxpayers a lot of money. There have been a \nlot of amendments. I will just mention those. We have totaled those, \nthe total for 2004. Senator Specter has made points of order, all of \nwhich were sustained, that saved $24.481 billion in 2004--over a 10-\nyear period, $352 billion--by basically staying with the budget.\n  This amendment breaks the budget. This amendment breaks the budget \ndeal that the chairman of the Appropriations Committee negotiated with \nthe President of the United States. It\n\n[[Page S11312]]\n\nbreaks the budget that we passed overwhelmingly--that we passed after a \nlot of hard work.\n  Are we going to have a budget or not have a budget? This amendment \nsays we are going to add $1.5 billion for NIH and declare it an \nemergency; i.e., we don't expect it to count on the budget. In other \nwords, we don't want the budget to apply.\n  If we follow that analogy, it is like some of the other amendments \nthat were offered. Several people offered amendments that just said \nlet's take money from 2004 and put it in 2003 and therefore we will \nhave money for 2004. It was a sham. We defeated all those. If we do not \ndefeat this amendment, the budget is a sham. We will just say something \nis an emergency that is not an emergency.\n  We appropriate money to NIH. We have done so. I happen to be a \nsupporter of NIH. I have supported increasing money substantially to \nNIH over the years.\n  Looking back, in 1990 we spent actually $7.5 billion on NIH. In 2004, \nunder the budget that we have, without this amendment we are spending \nright at $28 billion. That is three and a half times what we spent in \n1990.\n  In 1998, when we said we were going to double it, we did. In 1998, we \nwere spending $13.6 billion for NIH, and the budget we have before us \nis almost $28 billion--more than double since 1998. Those are enormous \ngrowth rates, maybe exceeding almost any other Government program.\n  Maybe we need to slow that rate of growth down just a little bit \nbecause now we don't have big surpluses. When we were doubling the \nprogram, we had some surpluses. Now we have a big deficit. Maybe we \nshould do a little bit better job of oversight.\n  I noticed there was a report. I remember, on ``CBS News'' the \nheadline was ``NIH Microbiologist Gets Paid $100,000 By Taxpayers To Do \nNothing.''\n  It was reported in the Washington Post. I ask unanimous consent to \nhave that printed in the Record, an article that was in the Post on \nJuly 4.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, July 4, 2003]\n\n       NIH Scientist Says He's Paid To Do Nothing; Agency Denies \nAdministrator's ``Surreal Situation'' of Collecting $100,000 Salary for \n                                No Work\n\n                          (By Tania Branigan)\n\n       Every weekday at 6:30 a.m., Edward McSweegan climbs into \n     his Volkswagen Passat for the hour-long commute to the \n     National Institutes of Health. He has an office in Bethesda, \n     a job title--health scientist administrator--and an annual \n     salary of about $100,000.\n       What McSweegan says he does not have--and has not had for \n     the last seven years--is any real work. He was hired by the \n     National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in \n     1988, but says his bosses transferred the research grants he \n     administered to other workers eight years later, leaving him \n     with occasional tasks more suitable for a typist or \n     ``gofer.''\n       NIH officials denied the allegations earlier this week, but \n     said they would reexamine the issue after Sen. Charles E. \n     Grassley (R-Iowa) raised the issue in a letter to Health and \n     Human Services Secretary Tommy G. Thompson.\n       Grassley, who as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee \n     has supported budget increases for the NIH, learned of \n     McSweegan's case when CBS News contacted him for a story on \n     the scientist. In the report that aired on ``CBS Evening \n     News'' on June 26, McSweegan said he had been paid to do \n     nothing for the past seven years.\n       McSweegan used to be NIH's program officer for Lyme disease \n     but was removed from the post in June 1995 after a dispute \n     over his repeated criticism of a politically influential \n     support group for sufferers and his allegations that NIH had \n     been too accommodating of the group. He had publicly \n     described the Lyme Disease Foundation as ``wacko'' because he \n     disagreed with its theories about the disease. The dispute \n     led to his suspension without pay for two weeks for \n     insubordination and conduct unbecoming of a federal employee.\n       In spring 1996, his responsibilities for an unrelated \n     program were also removed. He maintains they have never been \n     replaced.\n       In an interview Monday, Grassley accused NIH of ``an \n     absolute management vacuum'' and said it is ``ludicrous'' \n     that the administrator is being paid to do nothing.\n       ``We want to make sure we get the most bang for our buck, \n     the most research for our dollars,'' the senator added.\n       John Burklow, a spokesman for NIH, said McSweegan has \n     always been assigned duties appropriate to his position and \n     pay level.\n       ``The claim that he is being compensated for doing nothing \n     is completely inaccurate,'' Burklow said.\n       According to NIH, McSweegan is director of the U.S.-Indo \n     Vaccine Action Program, and has traveled to countries such as \n     Russia representing the agency. He has also ``produced \n     reports and other work products.''\n       But McSweegan said he has never been told he was director \n     of the program and knew of no such title. Three other people \n     ran the project, and his work for it--such as arranging \n     coffee for lunches and forwarding messages--was ``the kind of \n     work you would get an . . . to do.''\n       He added that the Office of Global Health Affairs had \n     organized and paid for his trip to Russia, and that his only \n     reports had been brief accounts of meetings.\n       McSweegan said he struggles to fill his eight-hour workdays \n     by reading, exercising and writing fiction. He has self-\n     published a bioterrorism thriller and a science fiction oval, \n     and is working on a third book.\n       But he says his six-page job description is the ultimate \n     work of creating writing and describes his position as ``a \n     bizarre, surreal situation--part Orwell, part Kafka and part \n     Dilbert.''\n       ``It's not my idea, said McSweegan, 47. ``I have pointed it \n     out repeatedly over the years. I suppose they are just \n     waiting for me to get bored and frustrated and quit. But I \n     haven't been inclined to do that, because my wife has a real \n     job and we have compelling family reasons for staying in the \n     area.\n       ``I just expect to do this for maybe four more years until \n     my wife retires,'' he said. ``It would be nice to get a real \n     job doing real work.''\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Basically, the headline is ``NIH Scientist Says He's \nPaid To Do Nothing; Agency Denies Administrator's `Surreal Situation' \nOf Collecting $100,000 Salary For No Work.'' The story goes on. I \nremember reading it, and I thought, whoa, somebody is not paying \nattention.\n  Please don't get me wrong. I know NIH does a lot of great work and I \nam supportive of that. But right now we have to live within a budget. \nIf the committee wanted to--the committee has $127 billion in \ndiscretionary spending--they could have given NIH more money. They had \ncontrol over that $127 billion. They could have shifted it around to \nwhere NIH would get more.\n  What the committee elected to do was: We will short fund NIH and we \nwill give a lot more money for a lot of other things, and then we will \ntry to run the gamut because we know NIH has a lot of support.\n  I think the committee needs to go back and say: Wait a minute, the \nbudget is $127 billion. It happens to be the largest budget of any that \nwe have before any committee, with the exception of Defense. If you \nadded all the mandatories to it, it is bigger than Defense. It is a \ntotal of $460-some billion.\n  I urge my colleagues, if they want to get more money for NIH, let's \nhave the committee go back and reallocate out of the $127 billion they \nhave under the budget. But let's live with the budget. Let's not \ndeclare something that is funded every year by appropriations an \nemergency; i.e., when we declare an emergency, it doesn't count on the \nbudget. If we are going to use the emergency game as a way of violating \nthe budget, let's just not have a budget.\n  We passed the budget through both Houses. We said you had to have 60 \nvotes in the Senate to declare an emergency. Our colleagues who are \nsupporting this amendment I have great belief sincerely support NIH, \nbut they underfunded it in their committee in relationship to other \nthings and now they want to say let's just declare an emergency and get \naround it so we will have more money.\n  I don't think they should get away with that. That is violating the \nagreement, the budget we passed. It violates the agreement we made with \nthe President of the United States. So I urge my colleagues to support \nme in my effort to sustain the budget.\n  Mr. President, I will be making a budget point of order.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will be happy to yield to my colleague, but I am not \nquite finished.\n  Pursuant to section 502(c)(5) of House Concurrent Resolution 95, the \nfiscal year 2004 budget resolution, I raise a point of order against \nthe emergency designation provision contained in the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Part of what the Senator said I agree with. We should \nhave been able to assign more money under our allocation process to \nthis subcommittee. We are not able to do so. However, the Senator from \nOklahoma was incorrect when he said we did not give them more money. \nThrough the agreement with the administration, we did bring back money \nfrom the allocation process for education. We increased that amount, by \nvirtue of what\n\n[[Page S11313]]\n\nwe did, by $2.2 billion. We took $3 billion out of Defense and \nallocated it to several subcommittees, including $800 million to this \nsubcommittee. But very clearly, this subcommittee is short of money.\n  There are a great many problems that we face. This bill is going to \nconference, and we don't know how we are going to work out some of the \nitems in this bill. There are several allocations we have made under \nour process that the House has not made. I take the position that this \nemergency is necessary to get this item to conference to see how we can \nallocate it. Obviously, we are not going to bring a bill out of \nconference that the President will veto. If the President tells us he \nis going to veto it because of these emergency designations, assuming \nthe House would agree to it--we don't know if the House will agree to \nit--but I do know this bill is very short of money.\n  The demands on our society are now so great that all of the things \nfrom SARS, to the things the CDC is doing, and all the things NIH is \ndoing--this is a bill that just absolutely demands funding.\n  I take the position that it is not inconsistent with the comments I \nmade to the President--that I would not support emergencies unless \nthere was a true emergency. I think this is a true emergency.\n  But in any event, if the Senate will vote as the managers of this \nbill have requested, we will take the bill to conference at $1.5 \nbillion more than the maximum amount I could possibly allocate and meet \nthe other demands of our other 12 subcommittees.\n  I say to the Senator from Oklahoma that I don't think I am breaking \nmy word at all. I hope the Senate will support us in taking this bill \nto conference with the most money we can possibly find to put in it and \ngo to conference with the House.\n  There are a series of items in here to which we know the House will \nobject. I believe by the time we come out, this emergency will not be \nneeded. If it is needed, I will personally visit with the President of \nthe United States about it, and we will see what he decides. If the \nPresident still takes the position that we should not include the money \non an emergency basis, I will at that time oppose it.\n  But right now, I urge the Senate to waive this point of order. If it \nis the first one waived this year, this is the one to waive. This is \nthe one necessary to do so.\n  I don't think it is inconsistent with my position.\n  I will tell Senator Nickles, the chairman of the Budget Committee, \nthat I think with the constraints we are operating under this year in \nview of the problems we have, being at war, and at the same time \nconducting all of these enormous projects that we are facing in terms \nof the health and welfare of our country, including education--this, as \nI said before, is the largest bill we have--this bill is underfunded. \nBut it is not underfunded because of what we did; it is underfunded \nbecause of what the Budget Committee did.\n  This is the one chance to overrule the Budget Committee. I intend to \nsupport Senator Specter, and I intend to support this emergency \ndeclaration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I remind my friend and colleague from \nAlaska--he is my friend--we had an agreement on $784 billion. The \nSenator from Alaska has an initial $5 billion on top of that. The \nagreement was $784 billion. The Senator from Alaska got $3 billion from \ndefense for other items; then an additional $2.2 billion on top of \nthat. A deal is a deal. If people do not want to waive the Budget Act, \nwe don't have to have a budget.\n  I tell my colleagues that if the VA-HUD bill wants to bust the budget \nby declaring an emergency, we can bust the budget all day long. Why \nhave a budget? They want to bust the budget by another $1.5 billion. I \nam sure every other committee would love to. Why have a budget if you \nare just going to say: Wait a minute; for an appropriated item we don't \nhave enough money. We want more, and we will declare an emergency. It \ndoesn't count. Now this year you will go to conference with the House \nwith different figures.\n  We are going to have the same figures so we can finish the bills on \ntime.\n  I am just disappointed in the statement of my colleague from Alaska. \nI believe a deal is a deal and a budget is a budget. It takes 60 votes \nto waive the budget. If our colleagues elect to waive it, I guess that \nwill be their choice.\n  This Senator hopes that we will not do it. The NIH gets an additional \n$1 billion this year. Maybe that is not enough, as some would like, but \nthe committee had $127 billion to allocate. They could have allocated \nthat in any way they wanted. They had great discretion. We give great \ndiscretion to the chairman of the subcommittee and the ranking member \nof the subcommittee to allocate the $127 billion. Yet it looks as if, \nwell, the NIH didn't do as well as many other accounts. Maybe that was \non purpose. I don't know. I do know the total exceeds the budget that \nwe passed. It exceeds the agreement we made with the President of the \nUnited States. It would say that $1.5 billion is an emergency for NIH. \nThis is normally an appropriated item. There is nothing emergency \nwhatsoever.\n  I urge my colleagues to sustain the budget point of order and not to \nwaive the budget.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma. Up my way, we say, ``Wait until the last dog is hung.''\n  The agreement we made with the President will be kept. In the final \nanalysis, it was not based on the allocations we made under our \nallocation process. It was based on the total.\n  We have 13 bills to consider. We will see to it that we keep our \nagreement with the President. As a matter of fact, he has the veto pen. \nHe will see to it that we keep it.\n  But there is a problem of getting bills done and taking to the \nconference the things that the Senate wants considered in conference.\n  I join with the Senator from Pennsylvania and the Senator from Iowa \nin wanting this money considered in conference. If it is not approved \nin conference, then we will not have approval.\n  I think there will be other items that the Senate will want to take \nout, and part of this money will come back in the final bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to support the position of the \nchairman of the Budget Committee.\n  The deficit for next year is now calculated to be over $530 billion. \nThat does not count the $160 billion that is going to be taken--every \npenny--from the Social Security trust fund surplus. Now we are talking \nabout an operating deficit of $697 billion. And we are acting as though \nnothing has changed. Something has changed. This country is digging a \ndeep hole.\n  I agree that NIH is underfunded. I would love to support additional \nmoney for NIH. But it is not there. It is not in this budget. It wasn't \nin the budget which I offered my colleagues and which the vast majority \nof Members on our side voted for. If we are going to be declaring \nemergencies on appropriated accounts where there is nothing that wasn't \nintended, there was nothing unanticipated, then we could just take the \nwhole budget process and throw it out the window and abandon all \ndiscipline.\n  This is a mistake, I say to my colleagues. It is a mistake tonight to \ndeclare an emergency where no emergency exists.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the chairman of the Budget Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A point of order has been made.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this is the most spirited debate of the \nentire bill, and we have had some spirited debates.\n  I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for his compliments.\n  I haven't gotten around to totaling the savings. But I was pleased to \nhear that we saved some $24-plus billion. Over a 10-year period, it is \nin the high of $300 billion.\n  I am pleased to note that I believe there is a very big difference \nbetween the National Institutes of Health and anybody else who wants to \ndeclare an emergency. Simply stated, NIH deals with life and death.\n\n[[Page S11314]]\n\n  At any rate, we have saved more than $24 billion this year--a vast \nsum over 10 years.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this amendment, and I move to waive \nthe Budget Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Senator from \nOklahoma. And this is a spirited debate.\n  I guess I rise in large part because of the agreement, as I \nunderstand it, that has gotten us to the point we are today; that is, \nto be able to progress on the appropriations bills with an overall sum \nthat was set with a budget that was specifically designed and agreed \nto, which this amendment, as I interpret it, blows away.\n  Although I, as a physician and as someone who values what the NIH \ndoes tremendously--indeed, it is my life, or has been my life--the idea \nthat we add $1 billion as an emergency at this point in time is \ninconsistent with the agreements we made up to this date.\n  Again, I would like to see that money invested and the NIH properly \nuse that money well. If $1 billion is not put in, the NIH will be able \nto continue to do its responsible role, and fulfill that role, in a way \nthat, to me, means this is not emergency money.\n  Thus, I will support the chairman of the Budget Committee, the \nSenator from Oklahoma, in the vote which we are about to take.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second to the request \nfor the yeas and nays?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Leader, I state categorically I did not make an \nagreement on any particular bill. We made an agreement that the bottom \nline would not exceed the amount that the Senator from Oklahoma stated. \nWe have a series of bills going to conference and we will keep that \ncommitment.\n  But with due respect, I made no commitment on any particular bill, to \nthe President or to anyone else.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, to reach this total sum, we established a \nbudget that we have been able to adhere to today, to which we have all \nagreed. My interpretation of this amendment, describing it as an \nemergency, blows away that budget which leads to the total.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, emergency, like beauty, sometimes is in \nthe eye of the beholder. Quite frankly, to this Senator, every single \npenny we put into NIH is an emergency. If you do not believe me, go out \nand talk to a family with a child that just came down with juvenile \ndiabetes and see if you do not think what we spend at NIH is an \nemergency.\n  Talk to a woman who has just discovered she has breast cancer and is \nfacing an uncertain future. Tell her that funding of NIH is not an \nemergency. Talk to someone who has suffered an injury who is now \nquadriplegic. They are looking for help to once again be whole again \nthrough some of the great research being done through NIH. Tell them \nthis is not an emergency. Go out and talk to a family who has a loved \none who has just come down with Alzheimer's disease not knowing what \nthe future is going to be. A mother, father, grandparents, looking \nforward to the debilitating effects of Alzheimer's disease. Tell them \nthat funding for NIH is not an emergency.\n  Whether or not this is an emergency is in the eye of the beholder. \nThink of the millions of Americans who have been afflicted with \nillness, disease, and injury who look to NIH for the treatments and \ncures; think about whether or not every single penny we spend on NIH is \nan emergency.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I wanted an opportunity as a cosponsor \nof the amendment to say a few words and to add my support to that of \nthe chairman of the Appropriations Committee and the chairman and \nranking member of the subcommittee.\n  We stand at a very unusual time. Because of the human genome and the \nadvances in molecular biology, it is now possible to develop and target \ndrugs to specific ailments and therefore to break frontiers, to cross \nbarriers and make uncharted progress. What we began exactly 5 years ago \nunder the leadership of the Senator from Pennsylvania and the Senator \nfrom Iowa was essentially to double the funding of NIH over 5 years, to \nbe able to take advantage of the new horizon in front of us.\n  I serve with President and Mrs. Bush, senior, as vice chairman of the \nNational Dialogue on Cancer. Senator Sam Brownback has just come \naboard. And in the Senate Cancer Coalition which Senator Brownback and \nI co-chair, we have heard miraculous testimony, for example, from Dr. \nBrian Drucker, the inventor of the drug Gleevec which is used to treat \npatients with chronic myeloid leukemia. Gleevec is one of a new \ngeneration of targeted cancer drugs that just kill bad cancer cells, \nleaving good cells unaffected. There is much less toxicity with this \ndrug. Individuals do not lose their hair, they are not nauseated, and \nit has been shown to produce a 90-percent remission rate. That is where \nwe are at this point in time. The sponsors of this amendment want to \ncontinue that advance.\n  I say to my colleagues on this side, we all voted for a host of \namendments. They all cost money. This is the big one. This is the one \nthat will really make a difference for the health of Americans. If this \namount is not added to the budget, the number of new and competing non-\nbiodefense research grants will drop, from 9,902 in fiscal year 2003 to \n9,827 in fiscal year 2004.\n  NIH says the optimum number percent of approval for these research \ngrants is about 40 percent. Through the increases we have made over the \nlast 5 years, the grant approval rate is now about 30 percent. All this \namendment does is allow us to keep even with that rate. Unfortunately, \nit takes $1.5 billion to do that.\n  The suffering out there is enormous. Because of advances, we can find \nnew cures and new drugs with better prevention and better \nrehabilitation. That is what I believe the American people want to \nspend these dollars on.\n  I have faith in what the chairman of the Appropriations Committee \nsaid. Actually, I have never in the 10 years I have been here on a \ndollar matter heard him make a misstatement. I have no reason not to \nbelieve what he is saying. It may be true in absolute terms that this \nis not an emergency and the original plans were to take this money in a \ndifferent way. For some reason that changed. The need is there. And the \nresults will be there. I am absolutely convinced of it.\n  Senator Brownback and I, as cochairs of the Senate Cancer Coalition, \nhold hearings. We hear from people. We hear from scientists. We hear \nfrom advocates. Yet more than 575 health, research, and disease \nadvocacy organizations support this amendment. That is no coincidence. \nIt is because people know now that because of the advances in molecular \nbiology, because of the human genome, we are on the brink of new \ndiscoveries. We want those discoveries to continue.\n  This is not pie in the sky. This is real. Every dollar spent will \nyield health dividends for people. I hope we will pass this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion. The \nyeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I announce that the Senator from Oregon (Mr. Smith) is \nabsent because of a death in the family.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nEdwards), the Senator from Florida (Mr. Graham), the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry), and the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. \nLieberman) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would vote ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Amendment No. 1522 by the Senator from Pennsylvania \nincreases spending by $1.5 billion.

Mr. President, I rise, as a cosponsor, to express my \nsupport for the amendment offered by my distinguished colleague from \nNevada, Mr. Reid, to provide funding for a number of programs critical \nto Hispanic children around the Nation. Clearly, the programs \nidentified in this amendment are vital to improving educational \noutcomes for Hispanic students.\n  As a nation we have made a commitment to leave no child behind. Yet, \ntoo often, the needs of Hispanic children are overlooked, and Hispanic \nchildren are left behind. The U.S. Census Bureau recently indicated \nthat Hispanics are the largest minority group in the country. The fact \nis, however, they often are among the most educationally disadvantaged \nstudents in the country. Hispanic students are less likely to complete \nhigh school and to enroll in or graduate from college.\n  The amendment before us will help to address these issues in several \nways. It includes $85 million for title III language instruction. Under \nthis program, State and local schools implement programs that help \nlimited English-proficient students learn English and keep up with \ntheir schoolwork. The Senate mark actually cuts this program from last \nyear's level of $685 million. This is unacceptable. For Hispanic \nserving institutions, the Senate bill provides a small but inadequate \nincrease above last year's level. This amendment includes $6.4 million \nin urgently needed funds for HSIs, which continue to receive \nsignificantly less Federal funding per student then other degree-\ngranting institutions.\n  My colleague's amendment also includes $4.6 million for migrant \neducation, which was level funded in the committee mark, and $1 million \nfor the College Assistance Migrant Program, which the committee cut \nfrom last year's level. These programs help to identify migrant \nstudents, provide health services, and provide counseling and other \nassistance for migrants who have dropped out of high school. In \naddition, the amendment includes $11 million for the High School \nEquivalency Program, $12.8 million for Local Family Information \nCenters, and $69 million for Head Start Migrant and Seasonal Programs.\n  I commend the Senator from Nevada for offering this amendment, and \nurge my colleagues to support it. This is an investment in our Nation's \nfuture. The academic achievement gap between Latino students and the \nremaining student population is a national disgrace. I am informed that \napproximately one-third of new workers are Latino. Let us work together \nto invest in these youth, for the benefit of the Latino community and \nfor the benefit of our Nation.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my fellow Senators \nto support this very important amendment. This amendment would invest \nan additional $190 million in our Nation's future, by strengthening \nseven programs: The High School Equivalency Program, HEP; The College \nAssistance Migrant Program, CAMP; migrant education; local family \ninformation centers; bilingual education; Hispanic serving \ninstitutions, HSIs; and Head Start for children of migrant workers.\n  If we do no pass this amendment, funding for the High School \nEquivalency Program will be cut by 43 percent. This program provides \nacademic instruction, counseling, computer assisted teaching, career \nawareness to migrant students studying for the GED, as well as \nassistance with college admissions and job placement.\n  If this amendment is not passed, 23 program slots will be eliminated \ndue to the lack of funding. Currently, these 23 slots are filled by \nsome of the oldest and best performing projects in the HEP program, \nsome of which have been providing services for 30 years. As a whole, 73 \npercent of their students received GEDs, and no less than three of the \nprograms have had consecutive years of 100 percent of their students \nreceiving their GEDs. All of these programs are up for renewal as well \nas competition for these slots with other programs.\n  One of the 23 programs that faces elimination is in my own State of \nNew Mexico at the Northern New Mexico Community College. Other States \nin which programs are at risk of not being renewed due to the lack of \nfunding include Pennsylvania, Texas, Idaho, Mississippi, Colorado, \nFlorida, Oregon, Tennessee, Washington, Wisconsin and California.\n  A second program whose funding has been cut is the College Assistance \nMigrant Program or CAMP. CAMP recruits talented migrant high school\n\n[[Page S11325]]\n\ngraduates and GED recipients, who aspire to a postsecondary education \nbut lack adequate resources. CAMP assists students in their first year \nof college with personal and academic counseling, mentoring, and \nstipends.\n  Before the Federal Government created CAMP programs, there was no \nrecord of a migrant child having completed college. Since their \ninceptions, both HEP and CAMP have achieved stunning success rates. For \nthe projects that received 5-year grants in 1999, 72 percent of the HEP \nparticipants have received their GEDs while over 80 percent of the CAMP \nstudents have successfully completed their first year of college. Over \nthe history of the program, nearly three-quarters of all CAMP students \nreceived baccalaureate degrees.\n  The existing 102 HEP and CAMP programs serve approximately 15,000 \nstudents in 25 States and Puerto Rico. Many areas of the country have \nno access to the programs at all. Based on the Department of \nEducation's estimate, of the over 750,000 school-aged migrant children, \nover the next 5 years there will be over 170,000 migrant children who \nwill become dropouts and eligible for HEP services. CAMP programs will \nhave approximately 140,000 students who will qualify for services. The \nneed for services far outstrips the programs' current resources.\n  The title I Migrant Education Program was established to provide a \ncompensatory education program designed to deal with the difficulties \nencountered by children of migrant workers as a consequence of their \nmobility. Some of these children attend three or four schools in a \nsingle school year. They have a need for coordination of educational \nservices among the States and local districts where they live, often \nfor a short time. The MEP builds the support structures for migrant \nstudents so that they can achieve high levels of success both in and \noutside of school.\n  The U.S. Department of Education reports that more than 750,000 \nstudents were identified as eligible for the program in fiscal year \n2001. Additional funds are needed to ensure that these children are \nable to meet the challenges mandated by the No Child Left Behind Act. \nThis amendment will provide an additional $4,587,000 in needed funding.\n  The Local Family Information Centers was authorized under the No \nChild Left Behind Act to provide parents of title I students, including \nEnglish language learners, with information about their children's \nschools so that they can help their children to meet the high standards \nwe have set under NCLB. The Local Family Information Centers also help \nparents to hold their local and state school officials accountable and \nbecome more involved in their children's education. This amendment \nwould increase funding by $12.8 million.\n  This amendment would increase funding to State and local education \nagencies in order to ensure that as many of the 4.6 million children \nwith limited English skills as possible learn English, develop high \nlevels of academic attainment, and meet the same challenging State \nacademic standards as all children.\n  Title III is a formula grant program that distributes funding to all \n50 States based on the number of limited English proficient, LEP, and \nrecent immigrant students. The funds are used for developing effective \nlanguage acquisition programs; training for bilingual/ESL teachers and \nregular teachers and educational personnel; parent involvement; and \nproviding services for recently arrived immigrant students. This \namendment would restore the $20.5 million cut in the current \nlegislation and increase funds by an additional $64.5 million.\n  Currently, 35 percent of Hispanics are under the age of 18. The \nEducational Testing Service has projected the U.S. higher education \nsystem will grow by 3.5 million additional students by 2015 and that \nnearly 40 percent of these new students will be Hispanic. HSIs serve \nthe largest concentrations of the Nation's youngest and largest ethnic \npopulation. HSIs, by definition, have a full-time student enrollment \nthat is at least 25 percent Hispanic; further, at least one-half of \ntheir entire student enrollment is low-income. The impending emergence \nof more than 100 new HSIs, mostly in California, Texas, Florida, New \nMexico, Illinois, in the next few years and the rapid growth of the \nHispanic college-age population underscore the urgency for immediate, \nmajor, and sustained increases in title V funding.\n  At a time when the current labor force is reaching retirement age in \nsubstantial numbers, Hispanics already represent one of every three new \nworkers joining the U.S. labor force, according to the U.S. Bureau of \nLabor Statistics. By 2025, the Bureau projects that one of two new \nworkers joining the U.S. labor force will be Hispanic. This amendment \nwould provide an additional $6.4 million in assistance to these great \ninstitutions.\n  Migrant and Seasonal Head Start, MSHS, programs serve nearly 32,000 \nmigrant children and nearly 2,500 seasonal children annually, operating \nin 38 States in every region of the country. Migrant and Seasonal Head \nStart programs were the first Head Start programs to serve infants and \ntoddlers. today, two-thirds of the children in the program are infants \nand toddlers.\n  Migrant and Seasonal Head Start was a response to the needs of \nmigrant families. In most States, local childcare resources are not \navailable when migrants come into a community, especially for infants \nand toddlers. When resources are not available, parents have no choice \nbut to take the children to the fields where they are exposed to \npesticides, hazardous equipment, extreme heat and other health dangers. \nThis program is ever growing and so greater resources are needed to \nprovide these essential services. This amendment requests an additional \n$69 million for Migrant and Seasonal Head Start.\n  We must do everything we can to provide every child with the best \neducation we can. I urge my fellow Senators to support these greatly \nneeded programs by providing them with the proper resources.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Reid \nHispanic educational opportunities amendment.\n  My Democratic colleagues and I have held roundtables with Hispanic \nleaders across the Nation and members of the Congressional Hispanic \nCaucus that have allowed us to share ideas and develop an agenda that \naddresses the issues that matter most to the Hispanic community.\n  We know how important education is to Hispanics and will continue to \nensure that it remains a top priority for the Democratic caucus.\n  Unfortunately, the Senate Appropriations Committee-approved bill \neliminated or significantly underfunded programs with a clear record of \nimproving educational opportunities for Hispanic children. Unless we \nrestore and expand these funds, millions of Hispanic students will be \ndenied the opportunity to achieve the American dream.\n  The fact is, Latino children are among the most educationally \ndisadvantaged students in our Nation. They have the highest dropout \nrate in the entire country, the lowest college attendance rates, the \nlowest college graduation rates, and are more likely to attend \nunderfunded schools in low-income areas.\n  Hispanic children make up 17 percent of the total school age \npopulation in the country and recent trends indicate that the number of \nLatino children attending our Nation's schools is increasing.\n  This amendment would help ensure that millions of Latino children get \nthe quality education they need and deserve. It would restore and \nexpand funds to programs with a proven record of improving achievement \namong Latinos.\n  New York's schools serve a large and growing number of Latino \nstudents and the rate of enrollment for limited English proficient \nstudents has grown by 44 percent since 1990.\n  Resources provided under title III of the NCLB help school districts \nin my State provide English language instruction to over 300,000 \nlimited English proficient children and nearly 120,000 immigrant \nchildren. Yet this appropriations bill cuts title III of the NCLB by \n$20 million.\n  Restoring this funding will help States, local schools, and colleges \nbuild their capacity to teach limited English proficient students \neffectively.\n  This appropriations bill also provides inadequate funding to serve \nthe children of migrant and seasonal farmworkers. Often called \n``children of the\n\n[[Page S11326]]\n\nroad,'' these children face many obstacles in their lives, including \nextreme poverty, geographic and cultural isolation, discrimination \nbased on race or ethnic status, language minority status, and, most \nimportant, mobility.\n  Currently, only 664 of 1,177 eligible migrant children are being \nserved in migrant and seasonal Head Start centers across New York.\n  This amendment will take an additional 150 migrant children in New \nYork out of the fields where they are put at risk of exposure to \nharmful toxins and pesticides and into quality head start classrooms \nwhere they can receive the social, behavioral, and cognitive skills \nthey need to help prepare them for school.\n  As they continue on their journey through the education pipeline, \nprograms like the High School Equivalency Program, HEP, and College \nAssistance Migrant Program, CMP, help these students beat the odds.\n  The HEP and CAMP programs are both very important to New York as well \nas other states in the Northeast. The HEP program helps migrant \nstudents who have dropped out of high school get their GED, and CAMP \nassists migrant students in their first year of college with both \ncounseling and stipends.\n  At the State University of New York at Oneonta, Luis Gonzalez, a New \nYorker and former HEP and CAMP student will be entering as a sophomore. \nLuis' experience as a migrant youth is shared by countless other \nchildren of migrant and seasonal farm workers.\n  For Luis, it resulted in a pattern of repeating grades until he quit \nschool to work with his father in the vineyards of Western New York. A \nyear later, he learned about HEP and earned his GED. He then applied to \ncollege and was admitted as a freshman to SUNY last year. As a CAMP \nstudent, Luis received vital academic, social, and financial support \nduring his first year of college, the most critical year for most \nfirst-generation college students. Luis now mentors other HEP students, \nis a member of the AmeriCorps program and has maintained a cumulative \nGPA of 3.04.\n  Securing additional resources for HEP and CAMP will help ensure the \ndreams of students like Luis become reality.\n  Many Hispanic students like Luis choose to move on to Hispanic \nserving institutions, HSIs. These schools, including New York's 12 \nHSIs, serve a large and growing number of Hispanic students. By \nsupporting these institutions we are recognizing the large contribution \nthey make to increasing access to higher education.\n  Failure to increase funding for these programs will not only hurt \nindividual Hispanic children. Unless we provide Latino children today \nwith the education they need to learn the skills necessary for a wide \nrange of jobs, we risk having a shortage of qualified workers in the \nfuture.\n  We need a highly skilled workforce to compete in this global economy \nand investing in the education and training of our Hispanic population \nwill help our Nation meet this challenge.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to support the Hispanic educational \nopportunities amendment.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am proud to cosponsor the Hispanic \neducational opportunities amendment which will help address the \nchallenges facing Hispanic students from coast to coast.\n  I thank Senator Reid and Senator Bingaman for offering this \namendment, and today I want to highlight how this bill will help so \nmany people in our communities.\n  Just last month in Washington State, I saw once again how important \neducation is to our entire state and especially to the Hispanic \ncommunity.\n  On August 11, I had the opportunity to hold a day-long summit of \nHispanic leaders in Yakima, WA. The turnout was overwhelming.\n  In one room, we brought together Hispanic elected officials from \nacross the State, along with public and private-sector leaders, on a \nhost of issues.\n  Congressman Ciro Rodriguez, the chairman of our Congressional \nHispanic Caucus, served as a cohost, and shared his national \nperspective on the issues.\n  We had also had international leaders, including Peruvian Consul \nMiguel Velasquez and Mexican Consul Jorge Madrazo.\n  I am especially proud that we had more than a dozen panelists who \nshared their expertise and led our discussion.\n  I publicly thank each of our panelists for their time not only at the \nsummit, but for dedicating their lives to helping the community. Many \nof them had to overcome significant barriers in their own lives, and \ntoday they are working to knock down barriers for all Hispanics. Their \nparticipation that day was just one example of the leadership they show \nevery day of the year.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print the names of the \npanelists in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          Education Panelists\n\n       Miguel Puente, CAMP Director at Heritage College, \n     Toppenish; Ricardo Sanchez, LEAP Director, Seattle; Armondo \n     Mungia, student at Eastern Washington University, Cheney; and \n     Elizabeth Padilla Flynn, Pasco School District.\n\n                     Economic Development Panelists\n\n       Luz Bazan Gutlerrez, President & CEO, Rural Community \n     Development Resources, Yakima; Veronica Yzquierdo, Executive \n     Director, Pasco Downtown Development Association; Jesse \n     Farias, Employment and Security, Wapato; and Gilberto Alaniz, \n     State Director, Opportunities Industrialization Center.\n\n                         Civil Rights Panelists\n\n       Lupe Gamboa, United Farm Workers; Roberto Maestas, El \n     Centro de La Raza, Seattle; Polo Aguilar, Grupo Mexico, \n     Yakima; and Kevin Diaz, Attorney, Columbia Legal Services.\n\n                          Healthcare Panelists\n\n       Teresa Mosqueda, Sea Mar Representative, Public Health, \n     Seattle; Kimberley Klint, Ph.D., Director of Mason Maters; \n     Vickie Ybarra, Director Planning and Development, Yakima Farm \n     Workers Clinic; Marisela Guzman, ConneX student, Toppenish; \n     and Jesus Hernandez, Lead Access Coordinator/Program Manager, \n     Community Choice, Wenatchee.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank each of them for their leadership, and today I \nam on the Senate floor supporting this amendment to help carry out the \nagenda we discussed at the summit.\n  I can tell you that even though we covered a host of topics, \nincluding economic development, civil rights and healthcare, the No. 1 \ntopic people talked about was education.\n  I was astounded to listen as leaders in the community, elected school \nboard members, and city council members told me that when they were \ngrowing up, very few people, if any, looked at them and said: ``You \nknow, you can be a success. You can pass first grade.'' Or that, ``You \ncan go on to college, and you can become something in this country.''\n  If we adopt this amendment, we will tell a generation of young \nstudents: We need you. We need you to be the next generation of \nengineers. We need you to be the next generation of teachers. We need \nyou to be the next generation of C.E.O.s.\n  Today we are missing out on an entire young population, and what they \ncan give back to this country someday in leadership, in economics, in \npaying taxes, and in being successful members of the community.\n  This amendment will help knock down the barriers facing Hispanic \nstudents, and we must adopt it.\n  Perhaps the most disturbing thing is that the underlying Labor-HHS \nbill we are debating cuts funding for critical Hispanic programs.\n  That is why we need this amendment to stop those cuts and provide \nfunding for critical services like extra help with preschool, English \nlanguage acquisition, tutoring, mentoring, and financial aid.\n  I want to highlight how this amendment will help in areas like \nHeadstart, migrant education, and language skills.\n  One program that I have seen bring help--and hope--to families for \ndecades is Head Start. This amendment will expand access to Head Start \nprograms for migrant and seasonal working families.\n  Migrant and seasonal farmworkers work hard every day so that you and \nI can put affordable food on our tables. It is a good deal for us, but \nmost of those families earn less than $10,000 a year. Many of their \nchildren pay a price beyond poverty.\n\n  When families don't have access to child care, they are forced to \ntake their children into the fields with them, exposing them to \nequipment and other hazards.\n\n[[Page S11327]]\n\n  Migrant and Seasonal Head Start programs meet the needs of these \nfamilies, keeping their children safe while preparing them for school.\n  Nationwide, 60 percent of children are being served by Head Start, \nbut for migrant children, it is just 19 percent and for children of \nseasonal workers, it is just 2 percent. That is unacceptable.\n  This amendment will boost the funding so we give more children of \nmigrant and seasonal workers a place in Head Start so they can start \nschool ready to learn.\n  This amendment does more than just increase funding to serve more \nchildren. It also makes sure that vulnerable children are not cut off \nfrom the help they are counting on.\n  The President's budget request slashed funding for the High School \nEquivalency Program, HEP, by 43 percent.\n  The appropriations bill before the Senate implements the President's \ncut, with a $10 million cut to HEP. It also cuts funding for the \nCollege Assistance Migrant Program, CAMP, by $400,000.\n  The funding cuts in the HEP program would eliminate the 23 oldest and \nbest performing projects in the program, two of which are in Washington \nState.\n  I have met with the leaders of HEP and CAMP programs in Washington \nstate. They are doing critical work at Heritage College and Washington \nState University HEP programs.\n  HEP provides education and counseling services to migrant students \nwho have dropped out of high school so they can pass the GED \nexamination.\n  Some of the 23 projects that could be closed down have been providing \nservices for 30 years.\n  As a whole, 73 percent of their students received GEDs, an amazing \nsuccess rate for a population of students who have already dropped out \nof school.\n  The CAMP program is also critical. It recruits talented migrant high \nschool and GED graduates, who want to go on to college, but don't have \nthe resources. These programs introduce parents and students to campus \nduring the summer before their freshman year. It helps those students \nin their first year of college with personal and academic counseling, \nmentoring, and stipends.\n  Before we created CAMP programs, there was no record of a migrant \nchild having completed college.\n  Since then, nearly three-quarters of all CAMP students have graduated \nwith baccalaureate degrees. Without HEP and CAMP, access to college \nwould be out of reach for the vast majority of migrant students.\n  The funding levels in this bill ignore the amazing successes we have \nhad through HEP and CAMP.\n  Because migrant children move around, they don't have a local school, \na school district, or even a State that is responsible for their \neducation. We need to keep this safety net at the Federal level.\n  Currently, funding for the 102 HEP and CAMP projects can serve only \n15,000 students, a small fraction of those who desperately need help. \nThe Department of Education has estimated there are now over 750,000 \nschool-aged migrant children.\n  Since migrant children have the highest dropout rate in the Nation, \nwith nearly 60 percent failing to complete high school, that means that \nover the next 5 years, 170,000 of these children will drop out of \nschool and be eligible for HEP services.\n  Over the next 5 years, 140,000 students will become eligible for CAMP \nservices.\n  It makes no sense for this bill to take away funding when so many \nstudents need help.\n  Another area where our country cannot afford to make the cuts in this \nappropriations bill is in the English Language Acquisition program. \nThis bill cuts the program by $20 million. That is unacceptable.\n  This amendment would restore that funding.\n  It will also increase support for limited English proficient, LEP, \nstudents to $750 million.\n  The number of LEP students has almost doubled over the past decade. \nIt has increased at nearly eight times the rate of total student \nenrollment. The teachers who are serving those students could use more \npreparation to teach students with limited English proficiency.\n  This amendment will help provide title III dollars so that these \nteachers can receive ongoing professional development.\n  The Reid-Bingaman amendment will help students overcome barriers at \nalmost every level of school.\n  Congress has a proud tradition of ensuring that our most \ndisadvantaged kids get a shot at the American dream. It is what we did \nwhen we passed title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. \nIt is what we did when we created Head Start. And it is what we did \nwhen we started giving out Pell Grants.\n  We need to carry on that tradition today, not out of charity, but \nbecause we recognize that these children are our bridge to a successful \nfuture.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment and give Hispanic \nstudents in Washington State and around the country a change at the \nAmerican dream and a better life.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1629\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today with my friend from Indiana \nto offer an amendment to the fiscal year 2004 Labor-HHS Appropriations \nAct. I would like to thank Senator Specter and Senator Harkin for their \nsupport for this amendment.\n  I usually come down to the Senate floor to criticize the amount of \nunrequested spending in appropriations bills. Not often do I propose an \nincrease in spending for a specific program. However, today, I feel \nobligated to offer an amendment to increase the level of funding for \nthe Special Volunteers for Homeland Security program with the \nCorporation for National and Community Service. I am requesting that we \nraise our level of funding by $5 million, to bring the total level of \nfunding to $10 million, which is what the program was funded at last \nyear. The administration requested a total of $15 million for this \nprogram this year. We are simply proposing to restore one half of the \nadditional money the President requested. This issue is of enough \nimportance to the administration as it was included in their Statement \nof Administrative Policy.\n  The amendment Senator Bayh and I propose restores important money to \nthe Special Volunteers for Homeland Security program, a critical \ncomponent on national service. This amendment increases the funding for \nthis program by $5 million to be more in line with the amount requested \nin the President's 2004 Budget.\n  We live in a time of heightened security where terror alerts have \nbecome an unfortunate reality. It is sobering to realize that the \nchances are strong that we will face another terrorist attack in the \nfuture. In addition to devoting considerable resources to fighting \nterror at home and abroad, we need to devote significant resources to \npreparing our domestic response to any future attack. We would be \nfailing in our responsibilities if we do not adequately prepare for the \nnext attack. The realities of the world in which we live today, require \nus to educate and prepare the public about terrorism and disasters. \nThese volunteers are an extremely effective way to achieve our mission. \nWe need to be fully funding these programs.\n  For a number of years, Senator Bayh and I have been working together \nto increase opportunities for service in the United States. We have \nintroduced legislation, the Call to Service Act, in the last two \nCongresses that would increase volunteer opportunities with AmeriCorps. \nWe have also worked together successfully to create a short-term \nenlistment program for our military. One of the fundamental aspects to \nany expansion of service opportunities must be to increase the number \nof volunteers in homeland security projects. Our legislation \nspecifically calls for more volunteers to perform homeland security \nfunction. Service programs such as the one in this amendment provide an \nimportant resources in preparing our Nation to respond to a range of \nemergencies by providing people who can serve in important capacities \nsuch as fighting forest fires, disaster relief, and working in hospital \nemergency rooms.\n\n  I would like to share some examples of the works these volunteers do \nin the various states and country. Currently, there are 17 programs \nthat received money during the second year of this program. The \ngrantees are a diverse group and are spread across the country from \nAlaska to Florida. Important\n\n[[Page S11328]]\n\ngroups such as Volunteer Florida, the American Red Cross of Greater New \nYork and the Housing Authority of the City of Milwaukee are all \ngrantees under this program.\n  In the first year of the program, 350 volunteers with the \nMunicipality of Anchorage, Alaska were able to deliver training to help \nhomebound seniors and help 4,500 disabled residents of Anchorage \nprepare to respond to a disaster.\n  In Oklahoma, volunteers with the city of Tulsa developed a citywide \nvolunteer disaster mobilization plan. Volunteers helped to educate the \ngeneral public by distributing a family preparedness guide provided \nwith information how to prepare for disasters. The volunteers convened \nmeetings that included information on bioterrorism response by local \nhealth departments and established safe and secure teams throughout the \ncommunity to serve as trained resources.\n  I could go on at length about the good things these programs \naccomplish.\n  Increasing the Special Volunteers for Homeland Security program is \nconsistent with our overall need to increase opportunities for \nAmericans to serve their country. We need to increase spending for \nfunding for all volunteer programs. Internationally, increasing \nprograms such as the Peace Corps are important in spreading American \nideals and values. Domestically, programs such as AmeriCorps need to be \nexpanded to provide services and assistance to those in need. Any \nexpansion of AmeriCorps and domestic volunteer opportunities would be \nan excellent opportunity to increase volunteer positions in the area of \nhomeland security.\n  Once again, I thank my colleagues from Pennsylvania and Iowa for \ntheir work on this important piece of legislation. I look forward to \ncontinuing my work with Senator Bayh and the rest of my colleagues in \nthe Senate to increase national service opportunities.\n\n\n                           amendment No. 1644\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, it was 35 years ago, at 5:30 a.m. on \nNovember 20, 1968, that a gas and dust explosion occurred at Consul No. \n9 coal mine near Farmington WV. The force of the explosion rippled \nthrough the west side of the mine, igniting mine fires and additional \nexplosions, blocking exits and shutting down escape routes. Large \namounts of smoke, varying in color from black, gray, white, and yellow \nexhausted from the air shafts, with major explosions shooting flames \nover 100 feet into the air. After 10 days, the search and rescue \noperation was halted and the air shafts were sealed to put out the \nunderground fires. Of the 99 miners underground at the time of the \nblast, the explosion took the lives of 78 coal miners, 19 of whom are \nstill entombed underground.\n  In response, the Congress passed the most comprehensive mine health \nand safety legislation to date--the 1969 Mine Act. The anguish caused \nby the Farmington disaster was expressed in the statement of findings \nand purpose of that legislation:\n\n       . . . the first priority and concern of all in the coal \n     mining industry must be the health and safety of its most \n     precious resource--the miner.\n\n  In addition to a comprehensive safety enforcement regime, the 1969 \nMine Act mandated limits on the coal dust levels to which miners could \nbe exposed. The Congress' goal was to protect miners from Coal Workers' \nPneumoconiosis, or Black Lung--a disease that results from coal dust \nparticles accumulating in the lungs, scarring the tissue. It is a \nprogressive, terminal disease that is irreversible.\n  It is not known how many miners died from black lung disease prior to \n1969, but since that time, even with the stricter standards mandated by \nCongress, over 106,000 miners have been diagnosed with the disease, \nwith the Federal Government receiving 5,000 new claims for black lung \nbenefits each year.\n  Last March, the Mine Safety and Health Administration proposed new \nrules to implement the 1969 Mine Act with regard to coal dust levels, \nand the outcry in opposition to those rules was almost deafening. \nNewspapers from The Courier-Journal and Lexington Herald of Kentucky, \nto The Charleston Gazette of West Virginia have described these rules \nas\n\n       impractical . . . ill-advised . . . [an] assault on \n     workers' health and safety . . . a campaign that would bring \n     back black lung.\n\n  Rallies have been organized in Pennsylvania and West Virginia--all in \nopposition to what experts describe as a roll back in the protections \nmandated by Congress in 1969 to prevent black lung.\n\n  These are seriously flawed rules that would undercut long-running \nefforts to improve the working conditions of our nation's miners. Under \nthe proposed rules, the levels of coal mine dust permitted in the mine \nenvironment reportedly would increase well beyond what was mandated in \nthe 1969 Mine Act. That is a giant leap backward in the nation's work \nto protect the health of miners.\n  And these proposed rules constitute only one in a series of proposals \nby the Mine Safety and Health Administration that are serving to erode \nthe trust of miners in the one agency of the Federal Government charged \nwith protecting their health and safety.\n  Last January, an air shaft explosion killed three workers at the \nMcElroy Mine in Cameron, WV. Later it was determined that MSHA had \nfailed to properly inspect that mine. One news journal reported that, \naccording to MSHA records, between December 2001 and January 2003, when \nthe McElroy mine should have had six surface inspections, it had been \ninspected only once--just once.\n  While this administration touts a low coal mine fatality rate as \nproof of MSHA's effectiveness, it ignores a series of accidents and \nnear-fatalities that have occurred since last year in Kentucky, \nIllinois, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. Last year's QueCreek \naccident alone endangered 18 miners, and, had it swung the other way, \nwhich it easily could have, the rate of recorded fatalities would have \nincreased.\n  This year's fatality rate continues to move higher, with 10 \nfatalities recorded in the last 3 months in Virginia, Kentucky, \nIndiana, Alabama, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. And now MSHA has \nproposed a rule to scale back protections against black lung.\n  In doing so, MSHA is undermining its own credibility. Contrary to \npast years, miners now view MSHA as an extension of an administration \nthat does not understand the dangers which coal miners must confront \nevery day. That is the only way to explain how MSHA can support a coal \nenforcement budget that clearly does not provide MSHA with the \nresources it needs to properly inspect our nation's mines. That is the \nonly way to explain why MSHA would propose a rule that rolls back miner \nprotections against black lung.\n  And to make matters worse, the media reports that a conflict of \ninterest may have existed when those rules were developed and proposed \nearlier this year. The Charleston Gazette reported last May that MSHA \nSecretary David Lauriski, on several occasions, petitioned MSHA to make \nthe same change in its rules that he is now advocating when he was \na lobbyist for Energy West. The Inspector General of the Labor \nDepartment has already been asked to investigate this conflict of \ninterest.\n\n  At the very least, there is something highly questionable about how \nthese rules were developed and what effect they will have on the miners \nof our states. The Congress has a responsibility to our nation's coal \nminers to seek certain assurances from the Federal regulators before \nthese rules are put into place. We have a duty to our constituents to \nensure that rule changes such as these are implemented appropriately.\n  I had intended to offer an amendment to prevent the implementation of \nthe dust rules proposed by MSHA, until the Congress could be sure of \ntheir consequences. After discussing this matter with Senator Specter, \nthe National Mining Association, and the United Mine Workers, I have \ndecided not to offer that amendment for the time being.\n  Instead, I will support the amendment offered by Senator Specter, \nwhich would require the Labor Secretary to report a new rule that \nincorporates the use of real-time dust monitors, assuming that those \nmonitors are tested successfully in the coming months.\n  However, it is important that the Mine Safety and Health \nAdministration understand that this language is\n\n[[Page S11329]]\n\nbinding. It must issue a new rule if the personal dust monitoring \ndevices prove successful. And I hope that they understand that the \nminers of our States and their representatives in the Congress will be \nwatching, and that we will continue to oppose any effort to circumvent \nthe 1969 Mine Act with regard to dust levels.\n  I urge Senators to take this opportunity to improve the credibility \nof the Mine Safety and Health Administration. I urge Senators to recall \nthe findings of the Congress that were contained in the 1969 Mine Act:\n\n       The first priority and concern of all in the coal mining \n     industry must be the health and safety of its most precious \n     resource--the miner.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. It is a privilege to join Senator Byrd and Senator \nSpecter on this amendment to increase health and safety protections for \nthe Nation's coal miners.\n  Coal mining is difficult and dangerous work. Miners daily face the \nrisk of mine collapse, mine fires, and the debilitating illness called \nblack lung disease. Each year, over 4,000 coal miners lose time at work \nbecause of injuries on the job. We all remember the near-tragedy last \nsummer at Quecreek Mine in Pennsylvania, when nine miners were trapped \nunderground for 3 days. Miraculously, they were rescued but many other \nminers are not so fortunate.\n  Congress passed the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act in 1969 to \nprotect miners from these hazards. One of the most critical parts of \nthe Mine Safety Act is its requirement that mine operators reduce and \ncontrol the level of dust that miners inhale during their shifts.\n  Since then, we have made great progress in reducing the number of \ncases of black lung, but this battle is far from over. Over 100,000 \nformer miners and their dependents are receiving Federal benefits today \nbecause they or their family members have had black lung. Each year, \nmore than 1,000 workers die from the disease--and hundreds of new cases \nof black lung are reported each year.\n  This amendment deals with MSHA's proposed regulations on dust levels \nand dust monitoring. Many of us are deeply troubled by the \nadministration's proposal. The proposed regulation reduces the \nprotections of the Mine Safety Act. It would allow coal mine operators \nto raise dust levels up to four times the amount now permitted by the \nact. It would also reduce the number of samples taken in mines to \nmeasure coal dust exposure.\n  It makes no sense to roll back the current protections. Instead of \nincreasing the number of inspections and tightening the dust standard, \nthe administration's regulation would allow coal mines to raise the \namount of dust miners are exposed to. The new regulation directly \ncontradicts the recommendations of the National Institute for \nOccupational Safety and Health, under which the permitted level of coal \ndust would be cut in half.\n  Senator Byrd and Senator Specter have proposed this amendment to \nrequire MSHA to consider incorporating the new Personal Dust Monitor \ntechnology, once testing is completed. This amendment is supported by \nboth the coal mining industry and by the United Mineworkers.\n  These Personal Dust Monitors have been developed in conjunction with \nlabor and industry. They would be worn by individual miners at all \ntimes and could measure more accurately than any existing technology \nhow much coal dust each miner is exposed to.\n  MSHA itself has acknowledged the role of Dust Monitors in miner \nsafety. It has extended the current rulemaking period in order to \ninclude comments based upon Dust Monitor testing. This amendment would \ngo one step further, by requiring MSHA to consider reproposing the rule \nto incorporate Personal Dust Monitors as part of the required \nsafeguards in the Nation's mines.\n  Incorporating these technological advances into the rules on coal \ndust monitoring is a very important step. The Nation's miners risk \ntheir lives every day to provide critical domestic sources of energy, \nand we need to do all we can to protect their lives and health.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to support this amendment to use all \navailable technologies to protect the Nation's hard-working coal \nminers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1645\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask the indulgence of the Senate for a \nbrief statement I am going to make.\n  As we all know, Senator Paul Wellstone, his wife Sheila, and his \ndaughter Marcia, three staff members, and two pilots perished in a \ntragic plane accident nearly a year ago near Eveleth, MN. The Senate \nlost an honest, passionate public servant, and we all lost a friend.\n  Senator Wellstone's life was a testament to his compassion and \ncommitment to serve the less advantaged. He was a tireless advocate for \npeople in need. That was never more true than when he began working \nwith children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy and their families.\n  In 2001, Senator Wellstone introduced the Muscular Dystrophy \nCommunity Assistance, Research, and Education Amendments of 2001 to \nintensify Federal investment in Duchenne and other forms of muscular \ndystrophy. The MD CARE Act asked the Director of the National \nInstitutes of Health to create centers of excellence to conduct basic \nand clinical research into Duchenne and other muscular dystrophies. \nThat bill was signed into law in December of 2001. About a year later, \nSenator Wellstone was tragically killed.\n  While we cannot replace the colleague and friend who served with us \nin this Chamber, we can commemorate his work on behalf of Jacob \nGunvalson and others who inspired the late Senator to see this law \nenacted. In September of this year, the National Institutes of Health \nwill announce the first grantees of its newly created Muscular \nDystrophy Cooperative Research Centers Program.\n  In addition, three NIH institutes--the National Institute of \nArthritis and Musculoskeletal Diseases, the National Institute of \nNeurological Disorders and Stroke, and the National Institute of Child \nHealth and Human Development--also set aside $1 million in the MDCRC \nprogram as the ``Senator Paul D. Wellstone Muscular Dystrophy \nCooperative Research Centers.''\n  I have an amendment that would rename the NIH Muscular Dystrophy \nCooperative Research Center program in honor of the late Senator Paul \nD. Wellstone of Minnesota. I will not read all of it. In part, it says \nthat the designation of the NIH Muscular Dystrophy Cooperative Research \nCenters program shall be known and designated as the ``Senator Paul D. \nWellstone Muscular Dystrophy Cooperative Research Centers'' in honor of \nPaul D. Wellstone, who was deceased on October 25, 2002. There is no \ncost involved.\n  I send the amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1645.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask unanimous consent that further reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To rename the NIH Muscular Dystrophy Cooperative Research \n Center (MDCRC) program in honor of the late Senator Paul D. Wellstone \n                             of Minnesota)\n\n       Add at the appropriate place:\n\n     SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF SENATOR PAUL D. WELLSTONE NIH MDCRC \n                   PROGRAM\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) On December 18, 2001, Public Law 107-84, otherwise \n     known as the Muscular Dystrophy Community Assistance, \n     Research and Education Amendments of 2001, or the MD CARE \n     Act, was signed into law to provide for research and \n     education with respect to various forms of muscular \n     dystrophy, including Dechenne, Becker, limb girdle, \n     congenital, facioscapulohumeral, myotonic, oculopharyngeal, \n     distal, and EmeryDreifuss myscular dystrophies.\n       (2) In response to the MD CARE Act of 2001, in September \n     2002, NIH announced its intention to direct $22.5 million \n     over five years to its newly created Muscular Dystrophy \n     Cooperative Research Centers (MDCRC) program.\n       (3) Senator Paul D. Wellstone was a driving force behind \n     enactment of the MD CARE Act, which led to the establishment \n     of the MDCRC program.\n       (b) Designation.--The NIH Muscular Dystrophy Cooperative \n     Research Centers (MDCRC) program shall be known and \n     designated as the ``Senator Paul D. Wellstone Muscular \n     Dystrophy Cooperative Research Centers,'' in honor of Senator \n     Paul D. Wellstone who was deceased on October 25, 2002.\n\n[[Page S11330]]\n\n       (c) References.--Any reference in a law, regulation, \n     document.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Iowa for what he \nhas done. I am delighted to join him in sponsoring the amendment to \nname the Muscular Dystrophy Operative Research Center after Senator \nWellstone. Senator Wellstone attended many of our appropriations \nsubcommittee hearings on neurological disorders and was a tireless \nadvocate for medical research regarding the cause of muscular \ndystrophy. He was the original sponsor of the Muscular Dystrophy Care \nAct of 2001. This was the first disease-specific piece of legislation \nin the 107th Congress, the first major piece of health care legislation \nsigned by President George Bush, and the first piece of legislation to \never address a very lethal childhood disorder.\n  Just a few weeks before he died, Senator Wellstone visited a little \nboy named Jacob who was afflicted with muscular dystrophy. He and Jacob \nmade some television ads, which sadly didn't air because of Senator \nWellstone's tragic death. Senator Wellstone made a difference in the \nlives of thousands of children afflicted with this deadly disease. He \nleaves a legacy of unprecedented Federal commitment to muscular \ndystrophy research and development. I have no doubt that someday soon \nwe will win the fight against muscular dystrophy because of Paul \nWellstone's work.\n  Mr. President, I yield to my distinguished colleague from \nPennsylvania, Senator Santorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator withhold?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I will be happy to withhold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on amendment No. 1645? \nIf not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1645) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1623\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, earlier today, I offered an amendment to \nincrease the amount of money in the Aid for Africa Program to the \nnumber that met the authorization level this Senate passed just a \ncouple months ago. It was an additional $350 million which would be \nneeded to do the $2 billion in bilateral aid to which we committed, \nplus the $400 million we would need to match roughly $700 million-plus \nthat has now been put forward by other countries for the Global Fund.\n  This bill is, in combination with the foreign operations bill, $350 \nmillion short for what I believe is the most important health crisis \nfacing the world and one I would argue is, as far as dollars spent, \ngoing to save more lives and improve the quality of life for more \npeople than probably any other single dollar item we are doing in this \nbill.\n  I believe this is the highest priority. That is why I was willing to \noffer an amendment to fund this program fully and to do so with an \nacross-the-board cut. Having seen the success of an across-the-board \ncut in a previous amendment, I have not been necessarily encouraged by \nmy colleagues to continue this effort.\n  I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania, my colleague, in sharpening \nhis pencil to come up with enough money to at least meet the \nPresident's request on his program, which is an additional $61 million. \nIt is an amendment Senator DeWine offered earlier for mother-to-child \ntransmission and for nonmother-to-child transmission.\n  Senator DeWine has been doing some great work, along, I understand \nnow, with Senator Durbin, to come up with this money.\n  In exchange for the acceptance of that amendment by the managers, I \nam going to withhold my amendment. I yield to the Senator from Ohio to \nexplain what his amendment does.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania. I also thank my \nother colleague from Pennsylvania, the chairman of the committee, for \nhis good work on this bill and for his willingness to work with us on \nthis very important issue.\n  I know the hour is late, Mr. President. I am just going to take \nliterally 2 minutes to explain this amendment. I will offer the \namendment and then I believe the amendment will be accepted.\n  This amendment is very simple. What it does is it will restore the \nmoney to this bill the President has requested this Congress to provide \nfor a program that literally will save tens of thousands, maybe \nhundreds of thousands, of lives of innocent children. We have the \nability today to see a pregnant mother who is HIV positive and to \nprovide her with the care and the drugs to ensure she will not give \nbirth to a child who is HIV positive.\n  The statistics are very simple and the facts are very simple. If a \nwoman today is pregnant and is HIV positive, the odds are--the \npercentage is about 30 percent--she will give birth to a child who is \nHIV positive. In sub-Saharan Africa or in Haiti or in Guyana, there are \nprograms today that will reduce those odds from 30 percent down to 5 or \n10 percent for as little as $3 to $4 per woman. That is not per day. \nThat is per woman per child. It is almost a miracle.\n  My colleague in the Chair and other Members of the Senate who just \ncame back from a trip, led by Majority Leader Bill Frist, to Africa saw \nthese programs in place. They work. What this extra $60 million will do \nis to help ensure there will be tens of thousands of more children who \nwill be born HIV negative.\n  I thank my chairman for allowing this money to come into the bill.\n  I call up my amendment on behalf of Senator Santorum and Senator \nDurbin, who went to bat, as he has many times in the past, for children \nand those who are HIV positive and who might be HIV positive. I thank \nSenator Durbin and Senator Santorum. I now call up my amendment No. \n1623.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Ohio [Mr. DeWine], for himself, Mr. \n     Santorum, and Mr. Durbin, proposes an amendment numbered 1623 \n     to amendment No. 1542.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To increase funding for activities to prevent the mother-to-\n                       child transmission of HIV)\n\n       On page 61, between lines 14 and 15, insert the following:\n       Sec. ____. (a) Mother-to-Child HIV Transmission \n     Prevention.--In addition to any amounts otherwise made \n     available under this Act to carry out mother-to-child HIV \n     transmission prevention activities, there shall be made \n     available an additional $60,000,000 to carry out such \n     activities and $1,000,000 for non-mother-to-child activities.\n       (b) Reduction in Amounts.--Amounts made available under \n     this Act for the administrative and related expenses for \n     departmental management for the Department of Labor, the \n     Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of \n     Education, shall be reduced on a pro rata basis by \n     $61,000,000.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator from Ohio for \nhis outstanding work. I congratulate my colleague from Pennsylvania for \nhis contribution. The Senator from Ohio only talked to me about this \namendment about 79 times during the course of the last 2 days. To say \nthat he was persistent would be a vast understatement.\n  We are prepared to accept this $61 million for the global AIDS for \nthe CDC, of which $60 million is for the mother-to-child transmission \nprevention initiative and $1 million is for other global AIDS \nactivities. This offset will be made from the administrative costs of \nthe Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education.\n  During the course of the debate, we have had a great many AIDS \namendments offered, and we wish we could have accepted more of them. \nBut this particular one is very precisely targeted. I know the Senator \nfrom Ohio just came back from Africa and feels very deeply about this \nissue.\n  We are pleased to accept this amendment, with our compliments to the \nSenator from Ohio, Mr. DeWine, the Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. \nSantorum, and the Senator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? The Senator from \nIowa.\n\n[[Page S11331]]\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have no objection to this amendment. In \nfact, I am supportive of it. I want to make it clear for the record \nthat the offset on this amendment is not an across-the-board cut. It \ncomes only from the administrative account of the--is it all the \nDepartments, the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and \nEducation--or is it just from the Department of Health and Human \nServices? I am a little unclear as to from what administrative account \nit is taken. I want it clear for the record. I just want to get an \nanswer to my question as to which administrative account the offset is \ntaken.\n  Mr. DeWINE. The Senator is correct, it is not an across-the-board \ncut.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I understand it is not an across-the-board cut. Is it \nfrom the administrative account of all three Departments or only Health \nand Human Services?\n  Mr. SPECTER. It is from all three.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I can check the exact language of the \namendment. Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and \nEducation.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Pardon?\n  Mr. DeWINE. Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education.\n  Mr. HARKIN. So it comes from all three accounts. Again, I just wanted \nto make that clear for the record, that it is not from one account; it \nis all three, and it is not an across-the-board cut.\n  With that, there is certainly no objection to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, have we adopted the DeWine amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We have not. Is there further debate?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n1623.\n  The amendment (No. 1623) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I now call up amendment 1542.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The substitute is pending and one amendment is \npending to the substitute.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 1561 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I withdraw the pending amendment, DeWine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered. The amendment is withdrawn. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1542\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I now call up amendment No. 1542.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n  Mr. SPECTER. This amendment is to strike all after the enacting \nclause and insert the following, which is the text of the amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n1542, as amended.\n  The amendment (No. 1542), as amended, was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment of the \namendments and third reading of the bill.\n  The amendments were ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill was read a third time.\n\n\n                    close up foundation fellowships\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, it is almost like the change of season \naround the Capitol when young people from all over the country descend \non the Capitol to learn about their Government. We all meet with groups \nof these students from our State. We take photos, we answer questions. \nBut if you take the time to look at the badges the students and \nteachers are wearing, more likely than not, they will say Close Up.\n  Like thousands of young people around this Nation, I got my first \nreal taste of our Federal Government from a trip sponsored by the Close \nUp Foundation. Since 1972, more than 26,000 students from my State have \nlearned about their Government through the auspices of this \norganization. Close Up has awarded some $3.7 million in fellowships for \nstudents in need and their teachers to encourage the broadest base of \npossible participation. Furthermore, this program was started by a \nlegendary member of this body, who also hailed from Louisiana--Allen \nEllender.\n  Moreover, there has never been a greater need than now for young \npeople to understand what our Democracy is all about. As we face \nenormous challenges at home and abroad, the better understanding our \nyoung people have about their Government, the brighter our future will \nbe.\n  Sadly, Mr. President, the Close Up Foundation, which has enjoyed the \nsupport of the Senate for several decades, did not receive any \nresources in this bill. They are seeking funding of $1.4 million, an \namount equal to last year's level. I would ask my friend, the Senior \nSenator from Pennsylvania, and chairman of the Labor, Health and Human \nServices Subcommittee, if he is aware of the precarious situation of \nthis program, and if he would be willing to work with me to find \nadditional resources during the conference process.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the junior Senator from Louisiana \nfor bringing this important issue to the subcommittee's attention. I \nbelieve that Close Up makes a vital contribution to civic education, \nand would not want to see the program fail. I say to my friend from \nLouisiana, that I will be pleased to work with her during conference to \nsee if we can find the necessary funding to meet Close Up's needs.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank my good friend and colleague from Louisiana for \nbringing up this important issue. I know my partner in this process, \nSenator Specter, worked hard to fund many priorities within a tight \nallocation. I look forward to working with him on this and other \nimportant programs in conference.\n\n\n                  pediatric graduate medical education\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator Specter, for \nall of the work he has put into drafting and shepherding the Fiscal \nYear 2004 Labor-Health and Human Services-Education appropriations \nbill. His leadership and his efforts should be commended.\n  Last week, I offered an amendment in support of our Nation's \nchildren's hospitals. My amendment would equalize the funding that \nchildren's hospitals receive compared to adult hospitals. Specifically, \nthe amendment would provide an additional $15 million to fund the \npediatric Graduate Medical Education program at $305 million. These \nmonies are used by children's hospitals across the country to hire and \nretain residents who are interested in pediatric research and in \nbecoming pediatricians.\n  I ask my colleague, the Senior Senator from Pennsylvania, if he \nsupports our Nation's children's hospitals and the Graduate Medical \nEducation program?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank my colleague, Senator DeWine. I strongly support \nour Nation's children's hospitals and the pediatric Graduate Medical \nEducation program.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Children's hospitals train almost 30 percent of all \npediatricians and half of all pediatric specialists. They also provide \nmore than 40 percent of the hospital care in this country for children \nneeding cardiac surgery, children suffering with cancer, and children \nwith cerebral palsy.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I agree with my colleague about the valuable role of \nchildren's hospitals in providing pediatric care and research.\n  Mr. DeWINE. The House included $305 million in its Fiscal Year 2004 \nLabor-Health and Human Services-Education bill. I have agreed to \nwithdraw my amendment, but I urge the senior Senator from Pennsylvania \nto continue working to provide in conference the most funding possible \nfor the Graduate Medical Education program.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I will do all that I can to see to it that the GME \nprogram is funded at the highest level possible in conference.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I concur with the chairman, and will strongly support the \nGME program.\n\n\n  centers for children's environmental health and disease prevention \n                                research\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I am glad to join Senator Harkin in confirming our \nintent that funding in the Labor-HHS appropriations bill be used in \npart to continue funding 12 Centers for Children's Environmental Health \nand Disease Prevention Research. These centers were established through \na joint initiative of the Environmental Protection Agency and the \nNational Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, and combine a new, \nunique, multidisciplinary\n\n[[Page S11332]]\n\napproach to researching, identifying, treating, and ultimately \npreventing health risks posed to children by environmental hazards in \nthe communities in which they live, play and attend school. As you \nknow, we do not earmark NIH.\n  I ask Senator Clinton, how much does NIEHS provide in funding for the \ncenters?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. NIEHS has provided $750,000 per center, for a total of \n$9 million per year to provide for direct and overhead costs that the \ncenters incur. I hope that EPA will also continue to hold up its end of \nthe funding to continue funding 12 centers. I thank Senators Specter \nand Harkin for their continued support of the centers, which are \ndirectly in line with our shared goal of addressing environmental \nfactors that may cause or contribute to childhood illnesses such as \nasthma, or that can interfere in the proper growth and development of \nour Nation's children.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am glad to join my colleagues in support of the \nimportant work that the Centers for Children's Environmental Health and \nDisease Prevention Research perform. The research and outreach that \nthese centers initiate is unparalleled. The centers have not only begun \nimportant studies into the potential impact of our environment on \nchildren's health, but have also cultivated invaluable relationships \nwith their surrounding communities. Continued funding for these 12 \ncenters will allow high-quality research involving local communities in \na collaborative process to continue and result in the most effective \ntranslation of research into methods of prevention.\n\n\nnational institute of general medical sciences charge to conduct basic \n                          behavioral research\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Will the chairman of the subcommittee yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I will be pleased to yield for a question from the \nSenator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. First, I would like to compliment the chairman and the \nranking member, Senator Harkin, for their leadership in developing an \nexcellent bill for consideration by the Senate. As a member of the \nLabor, Health and Human Services and Education Subcommittee for many \nyears I understand the challenge faced by the subcommittee each year in \ndeveloping a bill that adequately funds all the outstanding programs in \nthe jurisdiction of this subcommittee. The chairman and the ranking \nmember have done an admirable job and they set a fine example of \nworking in a bipartisan manner to meet the health, education and \nworkforces priorities of the Nation. I would also compliment the \ndedicated staff who support this effort. We would not have such good \nbills for the Nation without their counsel and hard work.\n  Mr. Chairman, I come to the floor today to highlight one NIH-related \nmatter that despite our best efforts remains largely unresolved. This \nyear again the Committee's report urges the National Institute of \nGeneral Medical Sciences to fund basic behavioral research. The \nCommittee report states the following:\n\n       Behavioral Research.--The Committee believes that NIGMS has \n     a scientific mandate to support basic behavioral research \n     because of the clear relevance of fundamental behavioral \n     factors to a variety of diseases and health conditions. The \n     Committee encourages the NIGMS to incorporate basic \n     behavioral research as part of its portfolio, especially in \n     the areas of cognition, behavioral neuroscience, behavioral \n     genetics, psychophysiology, methodology and evaluation, and \n     experimental psychology.\n\n  This is excellent language. The Committee has had similar language in \nfiscal years 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003, but little has yet been \ndone to implement the Committee's recommendation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee's NIGMS \nreport language from fiscal years 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003 be \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of our remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that the \nNIGMS statute, which states in Public Law that one of the purposes of \nNIGMS is to conduct and support behavioral research, be printed in the \nRecord at the conclusion of our remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. INOUYE. Would the chairman and ranking member join me in helping \nensure that the NIH complies with the wishes of the subcommittee on \nthis matter?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank my esteemed colleague, the \nSenator from Hawaii, for bringing this matter to our attention and I \nlook forward to working with him and the NIH to resolve this matter. \nThis subcommittee has successfully doubled the NIH budget over the last \n5 years. Thus this speaks to this subcommittee's commitment to all \ntypes of scientific health research, including behavioral health.\n  Basic behavioral research is essential if we are to successfully \naddress the many public health issues plaguing our Nation. Since \nSeptember 11, 2001, the psychological and physiological effects of \nterrorism and stress became real to all Americans across this great \nNation. It is imperative that we, as a nation, better understand the \npsychological effects of sustained stress and the role of the \nbehavioral health sciences in the prevention and treatment of the \nleading causes or morbidity and mortality. The leading causes of death \nand chronic illness are related to high risk behaviors such as: \nunintentional injuries and violence, tobacco use, alcohol and drug use, \ndietary behaviors, sexual behaviors, and inactivity. I am committed to \nworking with you and Senator Harkin to help ensure that NIH understands \nthe wishes of this Subcommittee.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Chairman yield for a comment?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield to my distinguished colleague and ranking member \nof this subcommittee, the distinguished Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator. Mr. President, I echo the sentiments \nof the Senator from Hawaii and the chairman of this subcommittee. The \nsignificance of behavioral health research has never been as important \nas it is now. The interrelationship between behavioral health research \nand the health of the people of this Nation is clear. I stand behind \nwith our Chairman, the Senator from Pennsylvania, and the Senator from \nHawaii to work with NIH to address the requests of this subcommittee.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n     Senate Report--Labor, Health and Human Services and Education \n                             Appropriations\n\n\n             national institute of general medical sciences\n\n                  Fiscal year 1999 (S.

Rept. 106-166)\n\n       Behavioral science research and training.--The Committee is \n     concerned that NIGMS does not support behavioral science \n     research or training. As the only national institute \n     specifically mandated to support research not targeted to \n     specific diseases or disorders, there is a range of basic \n     behavioral research and training that NIGMS could be \n     supporting. The Committee urges NIGMS, in consultation with \n     the Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences, to behavioral \n     science research community and other national institutes and \n     offices, to identify basic behavioral science research and \n     training priorities and to develop a plan for implementing \n     those priorities.

Rept. 107-216)\n\n       Behavioral science research and training.--As the NIH \n     institute most concerned with basic research, the NIGMS has \n     provided leadership in basic research on physiological and\n\n[[Page S11333]]\n\n     biological structures and functions that may play roles in \n     numerous health conditions. The Committee encourages the \n     NIGMS to develop collaborations with other Institutes, such \n     as the NCI and the NIMH, and the Office of Behavioral and \n     Social Sciences Research to fund basic research to integrate \n     physiological knowledge of pre-disease pathways with \n     behavioral studies.\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n                    Public Law 87-838--Oct. 17, 1962\n\n   AN ACT To amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for the \nestablishment of an Institute of Child Health and Human Development, to \nextend for three additional years the authorization for grants for the \n  construction of facilities for research in the sciences related to \n                     health, and for other purposes\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled, That \n     title IV of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C., ch. 6A, \n     subch.

Mr. President, I wish to inquire of my friend, the \ndistinguished chairman of the Labor, HHS Appropriations Subcommittee, \nabout the nature of funding in this measure for the care and treatment \nof unaccompanied alien children.\n  As my friend knows, in the Homeland Security Act of 2002, Congress \ntransferred responsibility for the care and treatment of unaccompanied \nalien children from the former Immigration and Naturalization Service \n(INS) to the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Refugee \nResettlement (ORR), effective March 1 of this year. Fiscal year 2004 \nwill be the first full year during which ORR will be responsible for \nthis important function, and\n\n[[Page S11334]]\n\nit is critical for ORR to have adequate funding to exercise its new \nresponsibilities.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I commend my friend from California for her tireless \ndedication to ensuring the protection of unaccompanied alien children. \nIndeed, it was her efforts last year that brought about the transfer \nof responsibility for these vulnerable children to ORR. I am pleased to \nhave been a supporter of those efforts.\n\n  As the Senator knows, the President requested $34.227 million for \nunaccompanied alien children for fiscal year 2004. The allocation \nlevels the subcommittee received for fiscal year 2004 were so low, the \ncommittee had to reduce the overall funding for ORR beneath the \nPresident's request. Nonetheless, the committee recommended the full \n$34.227 million for fiscal year 2004 for unaccompanied alien children \nthat the President requested.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator. It is important to note that in \nmaking its initial request for fiscal year 2004, the administration \nacknowledged that it was a preliminary estimate based on less-than-\ncomplete information. Since the administration made its initial budget \nrequest last January, it has become evident that ORR will need more \nfunds in order to fulfill its unaccompanied alien child \nresponsibilities.\n  In talking with experts who work with these children as well as with \nadministration officials, it has become evident that this \nimportant program will need at least $20 million in additional funding \nto order to operate effectively in fiscal year 2004.\n\n  As the Senate knows, I was prepared to offer an amendment to this \nbill that would appropriate the additional $20 million for these \nprograms, bringing the total appropriation for unaccompanied alien \nchildren for fiscal year 2004 to $54,227,000. This anticipated that the \nadditional $20 million being appropriated for these functions would be \nderived from unused refugee and entrant funds from prior fiscal years. \nThese funds have gone unused because of the unfortunate shortfalls that \nhave occurred in refugee admissions during the last several fiscal \nyears.\n  In the interest of time and in deference to the delicate balance that \nthe committee was forced to achieve in putting together this bill, I \nwill not offer this amendment at this time. However, I ask the chairman \nfor some assurance that he will work with House conferees to secure a \nminimum of $54.227 million for these functions in conference.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank my friend from California for withholding from \noffering her amendment. The Senator is correct that the program would \nbenefit greatly from an additional $20 million, and I am dedicated to \nhelping secure that funding before the end of this process.\n  As the Senator knows, the House mark for Refugee and Entrant \nAssistance was $33.797 million higher than the Senate was able to \nrecommend. Should the conferees reach agreement on overall ORR funding \nthat is closer to the Senate mark than the House mark, I will work with \nmy colleagues in the Senate and the House to achieve an appropriation \nfor unaccompanied alien children along the lines of the amendment that \nyou have so graciously agreed to withdraw.\n  Mr. HARKIN. As ranking member of the subcommittee I agree with my \nfriend from Pennsylvania and will work to ensure that the funding the \nsenior Senator of California is requesting for the Office of Refugee \nResettlement will be reflected in the final conference agreement.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank my friend from Pennsylvania, the \ndistinguished chairman, for that assurance. He has been an important \nally in our efforts to reform the treatment of unaccompanied alien \nchildren. I also commend my friend from Iowa for his tireless efforts \non behalf of all children throughout his career in the Senate, and I \nthank him for his support for this effort. I look forward to working \nclosely with both of my colleagues to ensure that adequate funding is \nappropriated to carry out the mandate that Congress created in the \nHomeland Security Act of 2002.\n\n\n                        community access program\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I've come to the floor today to discuss \nmy disappointment that the chairman's mark zeros out funding for the \nCommunity Access Program, a community-based program that seeks to \ncoordinate health care of the uninsured and underserved.\n  This development is especially disappointing because less than 8 \nmonths ago, the Senate overwhelmingly adopted my amendment to provide \nfull funding for the CAP program in the FY 2003 Omnibus Appropriations \nbill.\n  Since early 2001, the current administration has targeted this \nprogram for elimination. It is difficult to understand why the \nPresident's budget eliminate a program that seeks to get care for the \nuninsured at a time when the ranks of the uninsured continue to grow. \nAs more and more families lost their insurance coverage, programs like \nCAP will become even more important.\n  The CAP program helps increase the capacity and effectiveness of \ncommunity health care institutions and providers who serve patients \nregardless of their ability to pay.\n  The program supports community-based groups that coordinate care for \nthe uninsured. CAP has been very successful, and it enjoys broad \nbipartisan support. The CAP program was authorized in October 2002 as \npart of the Health Care Safety Net Authorization bill, which was \nunanimously adopted by the Senate.\n  The purpose of the CAP program is spelled out in the Health Care \nSafety Net Authorization bill. Let me read from the Committee report.\n  The purpose is ``to provide assistance to communities and to \nconsortia of health care providers, in order to develop or strengthen \nan integrated health care deliver system that coordinates health \nservices for individuals who are uninsured and individuals who are \nunderinsured. And, to develop or strengthen activities related to \nproviding coordinated care for individuals with chronic conditions.''\n  I believe these are goals and objectives that we must achieve, but \neliminating CAP will make this impossible.\n  I understand the fiscal pressures facing Chairman Specter, and I \nbelieve he has done the best job possible. But we are facing a major \nhealth care crisis in this country. I know the important role CAP can \nplay in working to address this crisis.\n  Washington State has four CAP grantees. They have worked hard to \nexpand access to quality, comprehensive care for those who have no \nhealth care safety net outside of the emergency room.\n  Washington's CAP grantees are based in Spokane, Wenatchee, Olympia \nand Seattle. As I've met with our CAP grantees, they've shown me a \nglimpse into the future of affordable health care.\n  For example, almost a year ago, I visited the Odessa Brown Children's \nClinic in Seattle. I saw a doctor, a dentist and a psychologist all in \nthe same room, not just treating individual body parts, but treating \nthe whole child in a comprehensive, compassionate way.\n  Today that project--known as ``Kids Get Care''--is connecting more \nthan 3,000 children to comprehensive health care.\n  These efforts are making a real difference for low-income families, \nand they need more investment, not elimination.\n  Our CAP grantees have worked to ensure that our increased investment \nin Community Health Centers reaps the greatest benefit possible.\n  They have worked with vulnerable populations to tear down all \nbarriers to care--not just economic barriers. They have used this small \ninvestment to better served the uninsured.\n  We should be strengthening efforts like this--not eliminating them.\n  Currently, one in nine Washington residents is uninsured. With my \nState's ongoing economic crisis, demand will grow for programs that \nprovide care for the uninsured.\n  We need to meet the immediate needs of families who today can only \naccess care in the Emergency Room.\n  CAP provides the seed money that gives community health care \nproviders the ability to serve those who have nowhere else to go.\n  I had considered offering an amendment to restore full funding for \nCAP.\n  However, because of the budgetary constraints, to secure the votes \nneeded, I would have to cut other vital Labor, HHS and Education \nprograms, many of which are already taking cuts.\n\n[[Page S11335]]\n\n  Instead, I would like to yield to the chairman of the subcommittee \nfor the purpose of engaging in a colloquy.\n  Chairman Specter, again let me stress my appreciation for your \nefforts. You have been given an almost impossible task.\n  The bottom line is our Subcommittee allocation for LHHS is simply not \nsufficient to meet the important priorities of labor, health care and \neducation.\n  I know you did the best job possible, but I am asking for your \nsupport of CAP in conference.\n  When I raised this issue in the subcommittee markup, you indicated \nyour willingness to work to ensure that this program is funded when the \nfinal bill emerges from conference.\n  Mr. SPECTER. It is true that we have not funded the Community Access \nProgram. That program has traditionally been funded by the House, and \nlet me assure you that it will be funded when we come out of \nconference. As the Senator from Washington is aware, the House passed \nLHHS Appropriations bill allocates a total of $104.317 million for FY \n2004 for the Community Access Program.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I want to echo the comments of my good friend from \nPennsylvania and thank Senator Murray for bringing up this important \nissue. I, too, am very concerned by the President's elimination of this \nsuccessful program. I look forward to working with Chairman Specter to \nrestore funding in conference.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the chairman and ranking member of their support \nin conference, and as a conferee, I will continue to work with you to \nensure the $104.317 million in FY 2004 for the Community Access \nProgram.\n\n\n                      dislocated worker amendment\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise to enter into a colloquy with the \ndistinguished chairman and ranking member of the Subcommittee on Labor, \nHealth and Human Services, Education. I came to the floor today to \noffer an amendment to increase dislocated worker formula funds in order \nto create new job training opportunities for dislocated workers.\n  Given the continued job losses nationwide, increasing funds to \nretrain workers is critical--both for workers and for the businesses \nthat are hiring workers. Our national unemployment rate is now 6.1 \npercent, which is close to the highest it has been in 9 years. Since \nthe recession started in January 2001, we have lost more than three \nmillion private sector jobs, and these job losses continue. In my \nState, Boeing announced over 600 layoffs in July. In August, it \nannounced over 500 more. And it has plans to cut a total of 5,000 jobs \nnationally by the end of the year. These funds are clearly needed to \nget Americans back to work.\n  I am pleased that my colleagues and I have reached an agreement to \ninclude an additional $25 million in this bill for the Dislocated \nWorker formula funds. Clearly, I would have liked to secure additional \nfunding, but recognize that the bill includes many worthy priorities \nand that funds are extremely tight. I look forward to working with the \nchairman and ranking member to secure this funding increase in the \nfinal version of the bill.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Senator from Washington for her comments. \nAnd I think she makes a good point about the important role the Senate \ncan play in supporting the retraining of dislocated workers. The \nSenator is correct that we have agreed to include an additional $25 \nmillion for the Dislocated Worker funding stream in the managers' \namendment. I will fight to keep this funding in the conference \ncommittee bill.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I agree with the Senator from Washington that there is a \ngreat need for additional funds for dislocated workers, I will work \nwith my colleagues to retain this increase of $25 million for \ndislocated worker formula funds in the conference committee bill.\n\n\n                 ymca and the healthy steps initiative\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I want to commend Mr. Specter and the \ncommittee for increasing funding for chronic disease prevention and \ncontrol programs under the CDC. I especially want to thank him for the \nreport language accompanying this bill that recognizes the important \nrole that nonprofit organizations such as YMCAs and Jewish Community \nCenters play in providing millions of American youth comprehensive \nhealth and wellness programs designed to address risk behaviors such as \nphysical inactivity, unhealthy diets, and tobacco use. Because only 25 \npercent of public schools are offering daily physical education \nprograms, and it has fallen to community-based organizations like the Y \nto step in and implement health promotion and health education \nstrategies and interventions designed to increase physical activity and \nfoster good nutrition among school-aged children.\n  I also support the committee's efforts to ensure that private \norganizations like the YMCA and Jewish Community centers are eligible \nto receive funding as part of the Secretary's steps to a Healthier U.S. \nInitiative. It is essential that we begin to encourage after school \nphysical activity programs that help reduce and prevent obesity.\n  As President Bush recently noted during a visit to the West Lake YMCA \nin Dallas to promote his Healthy Steps Initiative, ``the YMCA is an \nintegral part of a healthy America by encouraging our youngsters to \nexercise, to have fun, to get outside, to learn to eat good foods.'' I \nagree that national organizations, like the YMCA, that have a long \nhistory of serving youth and have the ability to assist state health \nand education departments in all 50 States, are perfectly positioned \nfor the job of helping us develop and deliver model physical activity \nprograms for elementary and secondary education students.\n  If we are going to quickly and efficiently make an impact on youth \nobesity, resources need to be made available to organizations that: \nhave a longstanding physical presence in our communities; have \nestablished and stable relationships with state and local health and \neducation agencies; and are experienced in providing health and fitness \nprograms to America's youth.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Hampshire \nfor his support for the subcommittee's efforts in this regard. We \nshould all be concerned about the scourge of obesity among our Nation's \nyouth, and I am committed to assisting the necessary partnerships and \nprograms needed to reverse these devastating trends. Those efforts \nshould include private organizations such as the YMCA to the extent \npossible and government at all levels should be working with such \ngroups to develop and implement after school physical activity programs \nto reduce and prevent obesity. I am delighted to work with my colleague \nfrom New Hampshire to ensure that national nonprofit organization's \nlike the YMCA and Jewish Community centers have an opportunity to play \na leading role in helping achieve the President's goals for a healthier \nAmerica.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I want to thank both of my distinguished \ncolleagues, and I want to add my concern over the growing problem that \nobesity poses on the health of our Nation. Specifically the emphasis \nthat it has had in the lives of our youth. Together we need to seek and \nwork toward a solution.\n  Nonprofit organizations play a significant role in this battle to \nkeep our Nation healthy. I look forward to working with my good friend \nand chairman of this subcommittee, Senator Specter, and my chairman on \nthe authorizing committee on which I serve, Senator Gregg.\n\n\n                           vaccine stockpile\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I am glad to join Senator Harkin in confirming our \nintent that the Vaccines for Children program funding in the Labor-HHS \nAppropriations bill be used in part to stockpile a 6-month supply of \nchildhood vaccines. Only a year ago, doctors had to turn families away \nat the door because of national vaccine shortages for eight out of the \neleven vaccine-preventable diseases. During the vaccine shortage, \nchildren became ill with pneumococcal meningitis and pneumonia, \ndiseases that could have been prevented with an adequate supply of the \npneumococcal vaccine. Fortunately, we have witnessed some significant \nprogress since then, which is a credit to a collaborative effort by \npublic health officials, vaccine manufacturers and providers. Shortages \nhave stopped, and childhood vaccines for eleven different diseases are \nno longer being delayed.\n  Mr. HARKIN. During the crisis, the HELP Committee met on multiple \noccasions to study this important issue. I want to thank my friend from \nPennsylvania and join him in affirming that it\n\n[[Page S11336]]\n\nwas our intent to use funding in this bill to stockpile a 6-month \nsupply of childhood vaccines. Despite the efforts of the committee and \nthe collaborative effort by many others on this important public health \nissue, I understand that my home State of Iowa, like the rest of the \nNation, only has a one-to-two month stockpile for some of the routinely \nrecommended childhood vaccines. Senator Reed, is it accurate to state \nthat these shortages, temporarily alleviated, could return at any time?\n  Mr. REED. Yes, unfortunately, the General Accounting Office report \nconfirmed that a pause in production for safety reasons could happen \nagain and would have a critical and devastating impact on the ability \nto vaccinate children and adults. That is why I appreciated the \nadministration's announced commitment to provide funds in the 2004 \nBudget for a vaccine stockpile. Senator Clinton, how much funding does \nthe administration plan to provide in Fiscal Year 2004 for a stockpile?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. The administration plans to provide $124 million in \nfiscal year 2004 so that it can store a 6-month supply of childhood \nvaccines by 2006. I thank Senators Specter and Harkin for affirming the \nadministration's commitment to prevent further vaccine shortages by \nstockpiling a 6-month supply of childhood vaccines. Senators DeWine and \nReed and I introduced the Childhood Vaccine Supply Act along with to \nstrengthen and support the administration's authority in these efforts \nand assure that the stockpile includes adults as well as all children, \nwho were affected by the tetanus-diphtheria toxoid shortage last year. \nSenator DeWine, is a vaccine stockpile sufficient to prevent future \nshortages?\n  Mr. DEWINE. No. We also need an additional buffer because CDC \nacknowledges that it will take until 2006 before we can have a six-\nmonth stockpile of childhood vaccines. That is why I joined you and \nSenator Reed in introducing the Childhood Vaccine Supply Act, which \nwould provide a notification mechanism so that CDC can work with other \nmanufacturers to maintain the vaccine supply when a manufacturer cannot \nproduce an adequate supply of vaccine. Each of the four major vaccine \nproducers has stated that they do not object to this sort of an advance \nnotice provision. We have worked amicably with Senators Frist, Gregg, \nand Kennedy on both of these vaccine provisions. We have worked \namicably with Senator Frist on this issue and our vaccine provisions, \nand fully expect to continue working with this bipartisan group of \nSenators to accomplish the important goal of assuring safe vaccines for \nall children.\n\n\n                               mentoring\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise to enter into a colloquy with \ncolleagues who share my zeal for quality mentoring programs, Senators \nAllen and Ben Nelson, and the distinguished leaders on the \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, \nEducation and Related Agencies. My concern is with the adequacy of the \nfunding level for mentoring included in this bill today. For the two \nprograms focused exclusively on mentoring, the Department of \nEducation's Mentoring Programs grants and the Department of Health and \nHuman Services' Mentoring for Children of Prisoners, the bill before us \ncommits just $38.6 million--well short of the President's request of \n$150 million. I understand that limited resources are constraining the \namounts we are able to provide for many programs, and I thank the \nchairman and ranking member for the increased they included in this \nbill for Mentoring Programs. But I do hope we can find some funding to \nfurther increase the allocation for mentoring.\n  I'm sure we can all remember an adult who made a difference for each \nof us growing up by spending time with us, encouraging us, and serving \nas a positive role model. That is exactly what mentoring is: a \nsustained relationship between a young person and an adult in which the \nadult provides support, guidance, and assistance to the young person. \nThe benefits of a mentoring relationship are wide-ranging--including \ngains in educational achievement, health and safety, and social and \nemotional development.\n  We have some wonderful mentoring programs in Hawai'i, and they have \nan invaluable impact on young people throughout my State. One of these \nexcellent examples has been the Senior Kupuna in the Preschools Project \nrun by the Hawaii Intergenerational Network that has achieved \nmeaningful results such as positive changes in classroom behavior. But \nthese programs need additional funding to serve more young people.\n  I would like to work with the distinguished chairman and ranking \nmember of the subcommittee to increase funding for mentoring in \nConference to a level at least equal to the House allocation of $75 \nmillion. Before I yield the floor to them, I am pleased to yield at \nthis time to another strong advocate of mentoring programs, the former \nGovernor of Virginia, Senator Allen.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Hawaii, Senator \nAkaka, for his work on this important issue. I, too, strongly believe \nthat mentoring is effective. Unfortunately, the need for mentors is so \nmuch greater than what is currently available. MENTOR/National \nMentoring Partnership estimates, based on the latest US Census figures \nand risk factors for youth, that approximately 17.6 million young \npeople could benefit greatly from a high-quality formal mentoring \nrelationship with a caring adult. Of those young people who need \nmentors, an estimated 2.5 million are fortunate to be in formal, high-\nquality mentoring relationships. But that leaves more than 1.5 million \nyoung people in need of mentors, falling into a ``mentoring gap.''\n  The President has requested $100 million for Mentoring Programs \ngrants and $50 million for Mentoring for Children of Prisoners as a \nstrategic first step to closing that mentoring gap, and I want to \nrecognize him for his leadership. Through a concentrated effort, we \nwill be able to match thousands of new children with caring adults. \nBut, that cannot happen unless we are able to increase the funding for \nmentoring in this appropriations bill.\n  Given the tight budget times we are facing, I appreciate the increase \nthat the committee was able to provide for mentoring. However, I \nbelieve that we can do better in conference. I, too, would like to work \nwith the chairman with the goal of matching or exceeding the House \nfigure of $75 million, even though it is still short of the President's \nrequest of $150 million. I would like to conclude my remarks at this \ntime and yield to a fellow former governor, the Senator from Nebraska, \nBen Nelson.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I begin by thanking my colleagues, \nSenators Akaka and Allen, for their efforts toward ensuring that young \npeople in this country are able to access valuable mentoring services.\n  As Governor, I helped the mentoring program TeamMates of Nebraska--\nwhich was started by former Nebraska football coach, now Congressman, \nTom Osborne--expand statewide. From your personal experience, I know \nthat, like any youth-development strategy, mentoring works best when \nmeasures are taken to ensure quality and effectiveness. Programs must \ncarefully recruit, screen, and train prospective volunteers, and then \nsupport them throughout the duration of the mentoring relationship. \nInadequate funding directly impacts a mentoring organization's ability \nto operate a high-quality program. I strongly believe that we should \nrecede to the House numbers on mentoring, which would provide $75 \nmillion to help match young people across the country with mentors.\n  I'd like to share a quote from a Nebraska mentee, Ean Garrett. Ean is \na participant in the ProPal Plus Mentoring Program in Omaha, Nebraska, \nand these are his own words:\n\n       Mentoring shows us that we don't have to live day by day, \n     that we live in a world full of opportunities. It teaches us \n     that with imagination and a lot of hard work, we can go as \n     far as we want. Mentoring helps us see that graduating from \n     high school is not an option; it is a requirement. And \n     mentoring helps us develop our skills so that we are \n     successful well-rounded people who are major contributors to \n     our community, our society, our country, the human race, and \n     the world. Thanks to ProPal Plus and my mentor, the American \n     dream is mine.\n\n  The chairman and ranking member have faced a lot of tough choices in \ncrafting this bill, and I am pleased they were able to find an increase \nfor mentoring. I do think Ean's words help us all understand why we \nmust find more. I will end there and yield time to the distinguished \nchairman and ranking member.\n\n[[Page S11337]]\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues from Hawai'i, \nVirginia, and Nebraska for raising this very important issue. I agree \nthat the funding levels for Mentoring Programs and Mentoring for \nChildren of Prisoners should be examined carefully in Conference. We \nhave a great many wonderful mentoring programs throughout Pennsylvania \nthat could use more funding in order to continue their good work with \nyoung people.\n  I applaud the three Senators in their goal that these two programs \nreceive the $75 million funding level proposed by the other body. I \nwill work with them and my colleagues in the other body to try to \nachieve this goal during conference.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I echo the comments of my colleague from \nPennsylvania. It has been proven time and again that kids act out the \nbehaviors that are role modeled for them. That's why caring adult \nmentors can truly help transform the lives of young people. A \nsubstantial increase in federal funds for mentoring would provide a \nmuch-needed infusion of grant funding into the mentoring community in \nIowa and across the nation. This funding is a wise investment in the \nfuture success of young people across this country.\n  Mr. AKAKA. I thank the chairman and the ranking member for their \nwillingness to work with us on mentoring funding as this appropriations \nbill moves forward. It will make a big difference in many lives around \nthe country.\n\n\n                funding for health professions training\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to engage the distinguished chairman \nand ranking member of the Labor, Health and Human Services, and \nEducation Appropriations Subcommittee in a colloquy.\n  I want to thank the chairman for the hard work he has put into \ncrafting the Labor-HHS bill that is currently before us. I know that he \nfaces many challenges in developing this important legislation every \nyear, and I commend him for his leadership. As the chairman knows, I am \na very strong supporter of Federal health professions training \nprograms. These important programs administered by the Health Resources \nand Services Administration, HRSA, provide critical support to health \nprofessions institutions, facilities, students and communities \nthroughout the country.\n  Support from these programs is particularly important to our Nation's \nhistorically black health professions schools. HRSA's Health \nProfessions Training for Diversity Programs, including Minority Centers \nof Excellence, Health Careers Opportunities, Scholarships for \nDisadvantaged Students, and Faculty Loan Replacement, support those \ninstitutions with a historic commitment to training minorities in the \nhealth professions. Without support from these programs, many of our \nhistorically black health professions schools, including Meharry \nMedical College in my home State, would be unable to sustain their \nmission of training minorities for clinical careers in medically \nunderserved areas.\n  The other programs that comprise the Health Professions Training \ncluster are equally important to ensuring that we meet our health \nprofessions workforce needs, particularly in the over 3,100 Federally \nDesignated Health Professions Shortage Areas. Primary Care Medicine and \nDentistry, Area Health Education Centers, Health Education and Training \nCenters, Allied Health, and other Title VII programs all play a \ncritical role in our health care system. As we continue to work to \nexpand access to quality health care for all Americans, I believe it is \nimportant that we support those existing Federal programs that make a \ndifference.\n  I also recognize that these programs have not yet been formally \nreauthorized, and so I appreciate the chairman's continued support for \nfunding these items. I look forward to working with him, Chairman Gregg \nand others to reauthorize these programs and to look for ways through \nthe reauthorization process to improve performance measures and \naccountability.\n  I, again, thank the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania and \nexpress my interest in working with him and our colleagues in the House \nto fully restore funding for all Health Professions Training Programs \nwhen the Labor-HHS bill gets to conference.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished majority leader \nfor his comments and for his leadership on these very important issues. \nHe has truly been a leader in this area, and he has consistently pushed \nfor improvements in Federal programs to eliminate health disparities. \nIn fact, he authored the Title VII and Title VIII Reauthorizations as \nchairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee's Public Health Subcommittee during the 105th Congress.\n  As he knows, our subcommittee has a long history of supporting HRSA's \nHealth Professions Training programs. Senator Harkin and I appreciate \nthe contributions these programs make to our provider workforce through \na variety of scholarships, loans, grants and contracts. Unfortunately, \nthe allocation that was provided to the subcommittee for FY04 did not \npermit us to fully support these worthy initiatives. I agree with the \nmajority leader that a restoration of funding for all health \nprofessions programs should be our goal in conference. I am pleased to \ncommit to the majority leader that I will do all I can to fully restore \nfunds for the four diversity programs and, at a minimum, bring funding \nfor the other programs to the House level.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I want to commend both my chairman, Mr. \nSpecter, and the majority leader for their support of the Health \nProfessions programs. My home State of Iowa is suffering from a severe \nshortage of health professionals. In a rural State, getting well-\ntrained doctors, nurses, and health technicians is always a challenge. \nOne of the biggest obstacles facing health professionals who want to \ncome to rural areas is loan debt. Many of these professionals cannot \nafford to work in small town America. And that is truly a shame. That \nis why I am a long-standing supporter of the Health Professions \ntraining programs. These programs help to train American workers for \ngood paying, steady jobs, while giving them the economic freedom to \nwork in medically underserved areas--many times the most rewarding \nsettings in which a health professional can work. I thank my colleagues \nfor their commitment to these programs, and I look forward to working \nwith Mr. Specter to try to restore this funding in conference.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I also wish to express my appreciation to \nthe chairman and ranking member for their longstanding commitment to \nHRSA Title VII Health Professions programs. I had planned to offer an \namendment to increase funding for these critical programs to the House \nlevel. I will not offer this amendment with the understanding that this \nwill be worked out in conference. I thank the managers of the bill and \nthe Senate majority leader and look forward to working with them as \nthis bill proceeds.\n\n\n           comprehensive cancer account survivorship programs\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want to commend Senators Harkin and \nSpecter for increasing funding for the CDC Chronic Disease \nComprehensive Cancer Account by $2.6 million in this bill, bringing the \ntotal funding for this account to $12 million in FY 2004. Given the \ntight budget constraints we are facing this year, I am particularly \nappreciative of the increased funding they were able to provide for \nthis important program.\n  The Comprehensive Cancer programs support public and private \npartnerships to reduce cancer incidence, morbidity, and mortality. \nThese efforts are especially important to the growing number of cancer \nsurvivors and their families who are faced with a wide range of \nphysical and emotional health complications after they have survived \ncancer. This is an especially critical issue for children.\n  According to the Institute of Medicine's National Cancer Policy \nBoard, while childhood cancer was nearly always fatal before 1970, 78 \npercent of patients today survive at least 5 years. While this \nstatistic represents a welcome trend and is a major victory against \ncancer, it raises new issues that need to be addressed.\n  Cancer survivors, especially children, are oftentimes plagued with \nneurological impairments, heart and lung problems, growth and fertility \ndisorders, and psychological stresses caused by treatment, \ncomplications of the cancer, or both.\n\n[[Page S11338]]\n\n  Over the past 3 years, 16 children in the small community of Fallon, \nNV, have been diagnosed with a rare form of leukemia. Sadly, three of \nthese children have since lost their battle with cancer. However, \nthanks to chemotherapy and other promising treatments, many of these \nchildren have shown tremendous progress and we are hopeful that they \nwill make full recoveries.\n  While we are focused and doing everything we can to ensure that the \nchildren in Fallon make full recoveries, we cannot stop there. We need \nto have support programs to ensure that these children--and cancer \nsurvivors around the country--receive the support and care they need \nand deserve.\n  According to the IOM policy board, up to 60 percent of survivors do \nnot receive coordinated follow-up care at specialized clinics, which \nare best suited for treating long-term medical and psychosocial needs. \nMoreover, pediatric oncologists are trained to battle the cancers, but \nfew are prepared to treat the chronic medical conditions that can \nfollow.\n  A recent assessment of all the existing comprehensive cancer control \nprograms showed that while all States were doing something with regard \nto cancer survivorship, there was no uniform, coordinated approach. The \nCDC, in coordination with this country's leading cancer survivorship \norganizations, have started a year long planning process to develop a \nNational Public Health Action Plan on Cancer Survivorship. This plan \nwill chart the course for the implementation of cancer survivorship \nactivities into State comprehensive control programs, State cancer \nregistries and other public health functions, which will be available \nthis winter for States to use.\n  We cannot afford to stay behind the curve on this issue, which will \nsurely become an even bigger problem as NIH research continues to \nimprove treatments. Providing increased funding to the Comprehensive \nCancer Account will not only ensure that adequate funds are available \nto disseminate the new survivorship plan to all States, but also ensure \nthat States will have the appropriate resources to implement the plans.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I share Senator Reid's support for the \nCDC's Chronic Disease Comprehensive Cancer program. As someone who has \ndedicated a good deal of my career to advancing treatment and services \nfor people with cancer, I especially appreciate the importance of this \nprogram. Having lost my two sisters and my brother to cancer, I \nconsider myself a cancer survivor and know too well the toll this \ndisease takes on everyone. We are under very tight budget constraints \nthis year, but we need to support the highest possible funding level \nfor comprehensive cancer in conference so we can ensure every cancer \nsurvivor has access to the necessary and appropriate care before, \nduring, and after cancer touches their life.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nevada for \nraising this important issue. As he pointed out, the lack of a uniform \nand comprehensive cancer survivorship plan is becoming a critical \npublic health issue for the millions of cancer survivors and their \nfamilies and friends. That is why I worked with my close friend Senator \nHarkin to secure increased funding for this program. Like so many \npublic health programs, especially within the Chronic Disease Account, \nthere is a lot more that can and should be done. I will work with my \nfriend from Nevada and the conferees to secure the highest possible \nfunding level for comprehensive cancer programs.\n  Mr. REID. I thank the chair and ranking member for their support for \nthis effort, and I look forward to working with them to secure the \nhighest possible funding level for the Comprehensive Cancer Account and \nthe cancer survivorship programs it supports.\n\n\n               adequate funding for medicare contractors\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise to engage in a colloquy with the \ndistinguished chairman and ranking member of the Labor-HHS-Education \nAppropriations Subcommittee. As the Senators know, Medicare contractors \nplay a critical role, partnering with the Federal Government to \nadminister the Medicare program. This year, these contractors will \nprocess over one billion Medicare claims; they are the primary point of \ncontact for beneficiaries and providers and provide the first line of \ndefense against Medicare fraud. They are very efficient, with \ncontractors' administrative costs representing less than 1 percent of \ntotal Medicare benefits.\n  While the subcommittee has done its best to provide needed funding \nfor Medicare contractors over the years, the fact exists that CMS and \nits Medicare contractors have been severely underfunded for years. The \nproblem has been more acute since the mid-to-late 1990s with the \nenactment of new Medicare laws placing additional responsibilities with \ninsufficient resources to perform these new duties, e.g., HIPAA, BBA \n'97, BBRA '99, BIPA 2000. Clearly funding has not kept pace with \nadditional work.\n  The pending Medicare reform legislation, S. 1, if enacted, will \nexacerbate funding problems for Medicare contractors. Hundreds of \nchanges are made that will require more work by contractors, such as \nsystem changes to adjust provider payments, expedited appeals processes \nand new coverage requirements.\n  I know that the chairman and ranking member share my concern that \nMedicare contractors receive adequate funding. The budget constraints \nwe face resulted in an insufficient 1.6 percent increase for Medicare \ncontractor operations, even though claims volume is expected to rise 11 \npercent. The Medicare Integrity Program, MIP, which provides \ncontractors with dedicated funding for critical fraud and abuse \ndetection activities, is not increased at all. Further, the money we \nprovide does not account for any of the new responsibilities \ncontractors will face if Medicare reform is enacted.\n  I am concerned that inadequate funding would be devastating to the \nadministration of Medicare and the safeguarding of the Medicare trust \nfund. Those that will feel the impact most are Medicare beneficiaries \nand the providers that care for them.\n  I am told that if funding is not increased to an adequate level, many \nMedicare contractors would have to reduce staff levels and eliminate \ncertain beneficiary and provider outreach activities. Since claims must \nbe paid, the result will be decreased customer service to beneficiaries \nand providers. I'm certain we'll hear from our constituents when they \nare faced with busy phone lines, longer wait times for questions to be \nanswered, reduced provider training on how to properly submit a claim \nleading to the submission and potential payment of improper claims.\n  I ask the Senators from Pennsylvania and Iowa to work with me to \nensure that Medicare contractors receive increased funding within the \navailable amounts appropriated in the bill. This is particularly \ncritical if Medicare reform is enacted.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I appreciate my friend from South Carolina's remarks and \nI, too, share your concerns. I'd like to point out that the Medicare \nIntegrity Program has had a significant impact on reducing waste, \nfraud, and abuse in Medicare. In fact, for every $1 spent fighting \nfraud and abuse through MIP activities, Medicare contractors save the \ngovernment $14. I understand that MIP is now capped at $720 million \ndespite continuing projected increases in claims volume. Therefore \nCongress must authorize an increase in this permanent funding \nauthority. I'd like us to work with the authorizing committee to \nincrease MIP funding beyond FY 2003 to ensure it meets the demands of \nrising workloads and to appropriately safeguard the Medicare trust \nfund.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the distinguished Senators from South Carolina \nand Iowa. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved $2,496,889,000 \nfor Medicare operations, the full amount of the President's budget \nrequest and an increase of $110,209,000 over the FY 2003 level. I share \nyour concerns that beneficiaries and providers receive the highest \nlevel of service by adequately funding Medicare contractors. We also \nmust ensure that the trust fund is protected by adequately funding MIP.\n  I thank the Senator from South Carolina and the ranking member of the \nsubcommittee for raising these important issues, and I offer my \ncommitment to work with you both to provide\n\n[[Page S11339]]\n\nMedicare contractors with the resources needed to best serve \nbeneficiaries and providers as well as encourage this Congress to \nauthorize an increase in the MIP funding so that we may appropriate \nthose critically needed dollars.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, my amendment helps States implement the \nNo Child Left Behind Act by providing $80 million for high quality data \nsystems. I was proud to create this program as part of our \nreauthorization of the Institute of Education Sciences last year \nbecause I saw a real need to help States do this right. Requiring lots \nof testing only has a benefit to our students if the results of those \ntests are used to help teachers focus their teaching on weak spots and \nto help superintendents, principals and policymakers direct resources \nwhere they are needed most.\n  Funding these data systems with this amendment will make sure that \nthe testing and attendance data required by No Child Left Behind are \nput to good use. Frankly, when I come down here to the Senate floor I \nusually prefer to talk about students, teachers and parents--not data \nsystems. But it is clear to me that funding these data systems will do \na lot more than buy computers and pay programmers. When I wrote this \nprogram I worked closely with the Harvard Civil Rights Project. They \nalso see the danger to students--mostly poor and minority students--if \nno one is keeping track of what's happening to them.\n  All the new testing and accountability required in No Child Left \nBehind creates a real risk that kids who are having trouble passing \nthose tests will drop out or be pushed out of school. The newspapers \nhave been filled in recent months with stories of these so-called \n``pushouts''--students who are discouraged from completing school \nbecause their test scores are low and threaten the school's ``adequate \nyearly progress.''\n  The focus on this new phenomenon has raised serious questions about \nthe ``Texas Miracle'' by pointing out the large numbers of students who \nare simply disappearing from our school systems. In July, the Houston \nChronicle ran an article celebrating a new system--funded through a \nFederal grant--that is helping educators in Houston keep kids in \nschool. They are using a data system to help lower their dropout rate, \nand they are definitely not the only ones who need help to do that. The \nhigh quality, longitudinal, statewide data systems that this amendment \nwould help build are one of the best tools we have to keep kids in \nschool.\n  Information is a powerful tool, and only by knowing which students \nare not showing up can our schools make an effort to find those \nstudents and help them. There are a lot of challenges today to keeping \nour teenagers in school, and I am not saying that data systems are the \nonly answer. In fact, I have introduced a whole bill focused on \nliteracy and counseling and school reform to address many of the issues \ncontributing to high dropout rates. But I know that funding these data \nsystems can make a difference.\n  Over the last few years I have secured funds to help Washington State \ndevelop a data system that will truly support the mission of leaving no \nchild behind by ensuring that every child is counted. The work they \nhave done to develop a high-quality, statewide system is really \nimpressive, and I know that they and other States across our country \nneed this funding to make that possible.\n  I'd like to thank the Senators from New Hampshire and Nevada for \nworking with me to fund this program. You can see that this is not a \npartisan issue. We need to pass this amendment and provide this funding \nto give States a critical tool to implement the No Child Left Behind \nAct. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting funding for this \nprogram.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have two articles printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Houston Chronicle, July 30, 2003]\n\n Tool Tracks Potential Dropouts; Profiler Software Lets HISD Keep Tabs \n                          on At-Risk Students\n\n                           (By Zanto Peabody)\n\n       The Houston school district has a high-tech new way to keep \n     high school dropouts--by catching them before they leave.\n       With a new computer database available at every campus this \n     fall, teachers can keep a virtual eye on every student and \n     identify those at risk of leaving. For the first time, \n     educators can look up a student's attendance and discipline \n     records, immigration status, grades, and test scores at one \n     source and use that information to predict dropouts.\n       ``All students will know someone is watching them, tracking \n     them, and is interested in their success,'' school board \n     member Laurie Bricker said at a news conference Wednesday.\n       Houston Independent School District has been developing the \n     PASS software--the Profiler for Academic Success of \n     Students--for more than three years, Chief Academic Officer \n     Robert Stockwell said, but recent events have underscored the \n     need for it\n       Starting with an investigation of possible dropout-\n     reporting fraud at Sharpstown High School and culminating \n     with a state audit that may lower the district's \n     accountability rating, HISD has come to know how badly it \n     handles some student data.\n       ``The dropout issue is a key battleground for our future,'' \n     Stockwell said. ``We must keep these students in school and \n     learning. Failure is not an option.''\n       The Sharpstown investigation showed that employee can and \n     have changed student records to reflect lower dropout rates. \n     The state investigation and one by a district task force \n     exposed computer records managed so badly that the district \n     has no way of knowing where students have gone.\n       In an attempt to escape Texas Education Agency sanctions, \n     HISD has promised to monitor students at risk of quitting. \n     District officials also are considering a plan to assign an \n     adult to each at-risk student.\n       Lee High School Principal Steve Amstutz said the newest \n     version of the PASS program will make that task easier. \n     During a demonstration of the program, Amstutz was able to \n     determine which fictional students were likely dropout \n     candidates--students who missed too many days recently or \n     whose grades dropped suddenly.\n       ``In the past, that would have taken a small army of people \n     looking through obscure records,'' Amstutz said.\n       HISD Chief Business Officer Cathy Mincberg said the \n     district developed its own program, using a $1.1 million \n     federal grant, because no other school in the nation has such \n     a comprehensive way of tracking students.\n                                  ____\n\n\n      The ``Zero Dropout'' Miracle: Alas! Alack! A Texas Tall Tale\n\n                          (By Michael Winerip)\n\n       Houston, Aug. 13.--Robert Kimball, an assistant principal \n     at Sharpstown High School, sat smack in the middle of the \n     ``Texas miracle.'' His poor, mostly minority high school of \n     1,650 students had a freshman class of 1,000 that dwindled to \n     fewer than 300 students by senior year. And yet--and this is \n     the miracle--not one dropout to report!\n       Nor was zero an unusual dropout rate in this school \n     district that both President Bush and Secretary of Education \n     Rod Paige have held up as the national showcase for \n     accountability and the model for the federal No Child Left \n     Behind law. Westside High here had 2,308 students and no \n     reported dropouts; Wheatley High 731 students, no dropouts. A \n     dozen of the city's poorest schools reported dropout rates \n     under 1 percent.\n       Now, Dr. Kimball has witnessed many amazing things in his \n     58 years. Before he was an educator, he spent 24 years in the \n     Army, fighting in Vietnam, rising to the rank of lieutenant \n     colonel and touring the world. But never had he seen an urban \n     high school with no dropouts. ``Impossible,'' he said. \n     ``Someone will get pregnant, go to jail, get killed.'' \n     Elsewhere in the nation, urban high schools report dropout \n     rates of 20 percent to 40 percent.\n       A miracle? ``A fantasy land,'' said Dr. Kimball. ``They \n     want the data to look wonderful and exciting. They don't tell \n     you how to do it; they just say, `Do it.' '' In February, \n     with the help of Dr. Kimball, the local television station \n     KHOU broke the news that Sharpstown High had falsified its \n     dropout data. That led to a state audit of 16 Houston \n     schools, which found that of 5,500 teenagers surveyed who had \n     left school, 3,000 should have been counted as dropouts but \n     were not. Last week, the state appointed a monitor to oversee \n     the district's data collection and downgraded 14 audited \n     schools to the state's lowest rating.\n       Not very miraculous sounding, but here is the intriguing \n     question: How did it get to the point that veteran principals \n     felt they could actually claim zero dropouts? ``You need to \n     understand the atmosphere in Houston,'' Dr. Kimball said. \n     ``People are afraid. The superintendent has frequent meetings \n     with principals. Before they go in, the principals are \n     really, really scared. Panicky. They have to make their \n     numbers.''\n       Pressure? Some compare it to working under the old Soviet \n     system of five-year plans. In January, just before the \n     scandal broke, Abelardo Saavedra, deputy superintendent, \n     unveiled Houston's latest mandates for the new year. ``The \n     districtwide student attendance rate will increase from 94.6 \n     percent to 95 percent,'' he wrote. ``The districtwide annual \n     dropout rate will decrease from 1.5 percent to 1.3 percent.''\n       Dropuots are notoriously difficult to track, particularly \n     at a heavily Latino school like Sharpstown, with immigrants \n     going back and forth to Mexico. Dr. Kimball said that\n\n[[Page S11340]]\n\n     Sharpstown shared one truant officer with several schools. \n     Even so, Houston officials would not allow principals to \n     write that the whereabouts of a departed student were \n     ``unknown.'' Last fall, Margaret Stroud, deputy \n     superintendent, sent a memorandum warning principals to \n     ``make sure that you do not have any students coded `99,' \n     whereabouts unknown.'' Too many ``unknowns,'' she wrote, \n     could prompt a state audit--the last thing Houston leaders \n     wanted.\n       A shortage of resources to track departing students? No \n     ``unknowns'' allowed? What to do? ``Make it up,'' Dr. Kimball \n     said. ``The principals who survive are the yes men.''\n       As for those who fail to make their numbers, it is \n     termination time, one of many innovations championed by Dr. \n     Paige as superintendent here from 1994 to 2001. He got rid of \n     tenure for principals and mandated that they sign one-year \n     contracts that allowed dismissal ``without cause'' and \n     without a hearing.\n       On the other hand, for principals who make their numbers, \n     it is bonus time. Principals can earn a $5,000 bonus, \n     district administrators up to $20,000. At Sharpstown High \n     alone, Dr. Kimball said, $75,000 in bonus money was issued \n     last year, before the fictitious numbers were exposed.\n       Dr. Paige's spokesman, Dan Langan, referred dropout \n     questions to Houston officials, but said that the secretary \n     was proud of the accountability system he established here, \n     that it got results and that principals freely signed those \n     contracts.\n       Terry Abbott, a Houston district spokesman, agreed that \n     both Dr. Paige and the current superintendent, Kaye \n     Stripling, pressured principals to make district goals. \n     ``Secretary Paige said, and rightfully so, the public has a \n     right to expect us to get this job done,'' Mr. Abbott said. \n     The principals were not cowed, he said, declaring, ``They \n     thrive on it.'' Every administrator under Dr. Paige and Dr. \n     Stripling, Mr. Abbott said, has understood ``failure is not \n     an option'' and ``that failure to do our jobs can mean that \n     we could lose those jobs--and that's exactly the way it \n     should be.''\n       As for adequate resources for truant officers to verify \n     dropouts, he said individual schools decided how to use their \n     resources, but added, ``money is not the problem, and money \n     by itself won't solve the issues we deal with every day.''\n       To skeptics like Dr. Kimball, the parallels to No Child \n     Left Behind are depressing. The federal law mandates that \n     every child in America pass reading and math proficiency \n     tests by 2004--a goal many educators believe is as impossible \n     as zero dropouts. And like Houston's dropout program, \n     President Bush's education budget has been criticized as an \n     underfinanced mandate, proposing $12 billion this year for \n     Title 1, $6 billion below what the No Child Left Behind law \n     permits. ``This isn't about educating children,'' Dr. Kimball \n     said. ``It's about public relations.''\n       If Houston officials were interested in accountability, he \n     said, they would assign him to a high school to monitor the \n     dropout data that he has come to understand so well. Instead, \n     after he blew the whistle on Sharpstown High, he was \n     reassigned, for four months, to sit in a windowless room with \n     no work to do. More recently, he has been serving as the \n     second assistant principal at a primary school, where, he \n     said, he is not really needed. ``I expect when my contract is \n     up next January, I'll be fired,'' he said. ``That's how it \n     works here.''\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, in our efforts to ensure that the United \nStates remains an economic and military superpower in the 21st century, \nwe must strive to improve the quality of math and science education in \nthis country.\n  The No Child Left Behind Act took some major steps in the right \ndirection towards improving math and science education at the K-12 \nlevel.\n  However, our work is not done. The Federal Government is not doing \nenough at the higher education level to ensure that our Nation's \ncolleges and universities are producing graduates to meet our country's \nnational security needs.\n  This is evidenced by the fact that legislation was signed into law by \nPresident Clinton in 2000 to allow America's employers to bring into \nthis country almost 200,000 highly skilled foreign workers a year \nthrough the H-1B visa program. America's employers needed these highly \nskilled workers to fill job vacancies in high tech, engineering, \nscience and other highly skilled positions.\n  Why couldn't we fill these almost 200,000 job vacancies a year with \nAmerican workers? Because this country's educational system was not \nproducing enough graduates with degrees in these highly skilled fields \nto meet the demand.\n  Admittedly, not long after this legislation was signed into law, \nAmerica's economy was hit by a decline, and this decline was greatly \nexacerbated with the events of September 11. But our economy is \nbouncing back.\n  Regardless, we must not forget the lessons learned on September 11. \nOne of the clearest messages was that we live in a dangerous and ever-\nchanging world.\n  Our world is much more dangerous today in many aspects than it was \nwhen I served this country with brief tours of duty in World War II and \nthe Korean War.\n  While citizens of this country sleep each night, the other half of \nthe world is thinking and contriving of every possible way to take the \nbusiness and the economy from the United States of America. In \naddition, while we are sleeping, people all over the world are trying \nto figure out how to come and take our security and our freedom away \nfrom us.\n  Once there was a great ocean that protected this nation. Now, with \ncyberspace, and all the other modern technologies it is simply one \nworld in economy, one world in national security.\n  Our country must continually be prepared to meet these threats.\n  One way we can ensure that we are prepared to meet these ever-\nchanging 21st century threats is to ensure that America's young minds \ngain the technical expertise necessary to understand and defend against \nthese threats.\n  Now, I love Shakespeare. I love theater. I love music, and I love \npolitical science, sociology and a lot of the liberal arts disciplines. \nMajors in these disciplines are important to a well-rounded and \nenlightened citizenry.\n\n  However, I also love this country, and I love freedom. Unfortunately, \ntoday, our institutions of higher learning are not producing enough \ngraduates with degrees in the requisite scientific programs to meet our \ncountry's future national security needs. If this continues, how will \nwe defend our Nation and defend freedom? Will we rely more heavily on \nimporting highly skilled workers than we have in the past?\n  To ensure our country's role in the future, we must look within our \nborders to meet these needs.\n  Unfortunately, today, a look inside our borders shows that this \ncountry is facing a dire shortage of math, science, and engineering \nstudents. According to the National Science Foundation (NSF), the \nengineering, mathematics, and science fields show declining numbers of \ndegrees.\n  Over the last 20 years, there has been a 20 percent decrease in the \nnumber of people receiving bachelors' degrees in engineering .\n  Moreover, during roughly the same time, the number of students \ngraduating with bachelors in physics has dropped by nearly 20 percent, \nand the number graduating with a bachelors in mathematics has decreased \nmore than 25 percent.\n  While the U.S. produces fewer and fewer mathematicians, scientists, \nand engineers, the rest of the world is making up the difference. And, \nAmerica is importing them. We are grateful for their willingness to \ncome to our shores and share their exceptional talents.\n  America, however, must now take steps to encourage, at all levels of \nour educational process, young people to undertake the training \nnecessary to meet our Nation's demands.\n  There is no doubt the course work is rigorous, particularly the long \nhours in the laboratory. I learned firsthand the rigors involved in \nearning an engineering degree because as a consequence of my military \nservice, I was privileged to receive from my great Nation GI bill \neducation benefits. Without these benefits, I would not have earned my \nengineering degree and would not have achieved my career goals.\n  However, given the rigors, and given the great need for graduates \nwith backgrounds in scientific courses of study, it is an absolute \nnecessity for the Congress to help in every way to inspire and reward \nAmerica's youth to pursue scientific courses of study.\n  Accordingly, I have submitted an amendment to this bill to encourage \nindividuals to pursue programs of study in math, science, and \nengineering.\n  The amendment is simple. It simply provides that the maximum Pell \nGrant award an individual can receive will be increased by 50 percent \nif he or she pursues a program of study in math, science, or \nengineering.\n  As you know, the Pell Grant program, which is funded at about $12 \nbillion a year, is one of the most successful and respected educational \ninitiatives taken by the Congress. The concept behind the Pell Grant \nproperly\n\n[[Page S11341]]\n\nrecognizes the needs of young people coming from economic backgrounds \nwhich make it difficult for them to acquire higher education.\n  Nevertheless, we in the Congress have an obligation when expending \ntaxpayer money, to do so in a manner that meets our Nation's needs. Our \nNation desperately needs more trained students in math, science, and \nengineering. That is an indisputable objective.\n  The Pell Grant program, in my judgment, offers Congress the \nopportunity to provide incentives for student recipients to pursue \ncurricula in math, science, and engineering.\n  My Pell Grant amendment is one idea, but I am certain it is not the \nonly idea. As a member of the Senate's Education Committee, I hope that \nmy chairman, Senator Gregg, will schedule hearings as part of the \nreauthorization of the Higher Education Act to look into our system of \nhigher education and whether this country is on track to produce \ngraduates who meet the current and projected needs of this country.\n  At this time, I will not offer my amendment in order to give the \nEducation Committee a sufficient opportunity to address this issue.\n  At some time in this Congress, though, I fully intend to reintroduce \nan amendment along these lines after the committee has reviewed the \nissues, after I get the views of the administration, and after the wide \nrange of people who on a daily basis review the Pell Grant program have \nan opportunity to share their views as well.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask for the yeas and nays on final passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the next vote will be the last vote of the \nweek. Tomorrow morning, the Senate will convene at 8:30 in order to \nrecognize the second anniversary of the September 11 tragedy. \nThroughout tomorrow, there will be various events to honor those who \nperished on that date 2 years ago. Tomorrow morning, there will be four \ndifferent moments of silence which will begin with the ringing of a \nbell just outside the Chamber doors. Members are welcome to come to the \nfloor tomorrow morning to participate and give remarks if they choose.\n  We will also conduct business during tomorrow's session. However, any \nrollcall votes ordered on Thursday or Friday will be scheduled to occur \non Monday. I thank all Members.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate insist on its amendment to H.R. 2660, request a conference with \nthe House of Representatives on the disagreeing votes thereon, and that \nthe Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on the part of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, all of us who knew and worked with Arthur \nHelton lost a dedicated friend, impassioned human rights activist, and \ninspiring humanitarian in the bombing of the U.N. headquarters in Iraq \nlast month. I extend my heartfelt sympathy to Arthur's wife Jacqueline \nand their family during this difficult time. His never-failing spirit, \nhis unique dedication, and his selfless and compassionate approach to \nall he did will be profoundly missed.\n  Arthur Helton's extraordinary commitments to human rights and to \nthose in need constantly shone through in the caring and courageous \nlife he led, and will continue to do so in the legacy he leaves behind. \nAt the time of his death, he was attending a meeting with the United \nNations envoy to Iraq on ways to improve the plight of the Iraqi people \nin the wake of the war and condition in which they live.\n  Throughout his brilliant career, Arthur was always an advocate in the \nforefront of the ongoing struggle for refugee and human rights, and it \nis no surprise that he was there at the heart of the action in Iraq at \nthat tragic moment when the guerrillas and terrorists made their \nmurderous move.\n  As an attorney with the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, Arthur \ncame to the aid of 2000 Haitian refugees detained in Florida in 1982, \nobtaining their release and finding volunteer attorneys for each of \nthem. Most recently, he held the position of Director of Peace and \nConflict Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York City. \nThere was no limit to his vision. The beautiful life he lived was \nalways an inspiration to all of us who care about respect for human \nrights in every land on earth.\n  Time and again, Arthur Helton gave to all of us in Congress \ninvaluable advice on these all-important issues. We were always amazed \nby his dedication and his expertise, and we were grateful for the \nunfailing wisdom of his counsel. His death in Baghdad is a great loss \nfor all of us, and for the cause of refugee and human rights he served \nso passionately and well.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the following \ncommentaries on the life of Arthur C. Helton.\n\n[[Page S11342]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Aug. 21, 2003]\n\n               Arthur Helton, 54, Refugee Advocate, Dies\n\n                            (By Paul Lewis)\n\n       Arthur C.

He was 54.\n       Mr. Helton, who was the director of peace and conflict \n     studies at the council and senior fellow for refugee studies \n     and preventive action, was visiting Baghdad to assess \n     conditions in Iraq.\n       When the bomb exploded, the council said, he was scheduled \n     to meet with the top United Nations official there, Sergio \n     Vieira de Mello, who was also killed in the blast.\n       ``Arthur was one of our most respected senior fellows and a \n     noted expert on refugee and humanitarian issues and \n     international law,'' Richard N.

He was a leading adviser to the \n     United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees on refugee \n     issues.\n       He was an adjunct professor at Columbia University Law \n     School where he taught immigration law.

Bombing\n\n       New York.--The Lawyers Committee for Human Rights mourns \n     the death of refugee expert Arthur C. Helton, who died in the \n     bombing at the United Nations in Baghdad on Tuesday.\n       Helton, a leading authority on refugee and humanitarian \n     issues, worked at the Lawyers Committee for 12 years, from \n     1982 to 1994, where he led the Refugee Rights Program. \n     Helton's most recent position was with the Council on Foreign \n     Relations, as the Director, Peace and Conflict Studies and a \n     Senior Fellow, Refugee Studies and Preventive Action.\n       ``People now talk about how refugee rights are human \n     rights,'' said Michael Posner, Executive Director of the \n     Lawyers Committee for Human Rights. ``Arthur was in the \n     forefront of promoting that idea. He was one of the first \n     people, if not the first, working at a human rights \n     organization with an exclusive focus on refuge protection and \n     the protection of displaced people. He was a major force in \n     building concern for refugees first in the U.S. and then he \n     took that concern international.''\n       When the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights was founded in \n     1978, one of its programs was devoted to helping win asylum \n     in the United States for those fleeing political and \n     religious persecution in their home countries. Helton took \n     that idea and created an inovative--and now much replicated--\n     pro bono representation program for asylum seekers. His idea \n     was to connect lawyers at the most prestigious firms in the \n     United States with refugees seeking asylum from persecution, \n     many of whom were indigent. The program Helton started now \n     represents more than 1,000 asylum seeks each year, winning \n     more than 90 percent of its cases.\n       Helton's first breakthrough in refugee advocacy in the U.S. \n     was in 1982 when close to 2,000 Haitian refugees were being \n     held in detention in Florida.\n       ``Arthur persuaded me to promise a federal judge that if \n     these Haitians were released, we would find volunteer lawyers \n     across the country for all 2,000 Haitians,'' Posner said. \n     ``And he did it. He devised a strategy to identify local \n     lawyers in 20 states. Working with the American Bar \n     Association, he recruited lawyers, trained them and connected \n     them with the Haitian refugees. As we now know, 20 years \n     later, he also helped foster a cadre of lawyers who \n     understand refugee issues, care about refugee rights, and \n     fight for refugee protection.\n       At the same time, in the early 80s, Helton was at the \n     center of virtually every legislative and regulatory battle \n     involving refugees.\n       ``He shaped U.S. national policy regarding refugees,'' \n     Posner said. ``Over the two decades of Arthur's work, in both \n     Washington and Geneva, he helped countless refugees in all \n     corners of the world.''\n       Helton also focused internationally. He led delegations \n     around the world to study the situation of displaced people \n     in Central America and other refugee issues in Southeast \n     Asia, Africa, Russia, and the Middle East. Because of this \n     work, he was one of the leading outside advisors to the \n     United Nations on refugee issues, and pushed the Office of \n     the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees to adopt strong \n     refugee protection policies.\n       ``Arthur was right in the center of figuring out how the UN \n     should deal with refugee issues,'' Posner said. ``When he'd \n     go to Geneva, he met with everyone who mattered. It was in \n     the context of this work that he met Sergio de Mello.''\n       At the time of the bombing, Helton was scheduled to meet at \n     the U.N. headquarters in Baghdad with Sergio Vieira de Mello, \n     the U.N's chief envoy to Iraq. De Mello was also killed in \n     the bombing.\n       ``Arthur was legendarily hard working and tenacious. He was \n     not afraid to have an audacious idea and he was not afraid to \n     carry it out, which he did successfully'' Posner said. ``I \n     can remember many times when people--everyone it seemed--\n     would tell Arthur he couldn't do something, and then with his \n     singular grit and determination, he would make it happen. \n     Refugees around the world have lost a tireless advocate, a \n     great friend, and one of their leading and brightest \n     lights.''\n       The Lawyers Committee extends its sympathy to Jackie, \n     Helton's wife, and to his family.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                      [From abanet.org, Aug. 2003]\n\n  Statement of Dennis W.

Helton, Director of Peace and Conflict Studies at \n     the Council on Foreign Relations and a regular columnist for \n     openDemocracy, was killed in the bombing of the United \n     Nations headquarters in Baghdad on 19 August. His colleague \n     and co-columnist, Gil Loescher, was critically injured. \n     Caspar Henderson and David Hayes pay tribute on behalf of \n     openDemocracy.\n       The bomb attack on the headquarters of the United Nations \n     operation in Baghdad on 19 August which killed the UN special \n     representative in Iraq, Sergio Vieira de Mello, injured more \n     than 100 and killed at least 18 other people. Among the dead \n     was Arthur Helton, the co-columnist of openDemocracy's \n     humanitarian monitor.\n       The other half of this openDemocracy partnership, Gil \n     Loescher, was critically injured in the blast, and has been \n     transferred to hospital in Germany, where, at the time of \n     writing he is in a critical condition.\n       Arthur's death is a dreadful loss to his family, friends \n     and colleagues. Our thoughts and condolences are with them. \n     We are with Gil and his family in spirit too.\n       This tragedy impacts heavily on openDemocracy. Arthur was a \n     good friend of this enterprise and one of the people who made \n     it what it is. He and Gil first approached us with a project \n     and a vision that chimed with what we wanted to do: to \n     facilitate serious, constructive global conversation on key \n     issues of our time. We built up a strong working relationship \n     from which we never ceased to learn new things.\n       Arthur was a serious, indefatigable scholar with \n     extraordinary range. He was warm and humorous too. I (Caspar \n     Henderson) will not forget his kindness when I visited him in \n     the grand premises of the Council on Foreign Relations in New \n     York earlier this year, and the touch of irony with which he \n     showed me a photographic tribute to his work in the hallway \n     of the Pratt house. In contrast to pictures associated with \n     many of his colleagues, which mainly showed important guys in \n     suits and ties shaking hands or dramatic shots of military \n     situations, Arthur's picture showed a refugee mother and \n     child. ``The token soft power guy around here'' he joked.\n       Arthur and Gil's humanitarian monitor combined expert \n     understanding of the many dimensions of humanitarian crises--\n     legal, political, logistical, military, historical--with a \n     willingness to think beyond current models. This search for \n     complex and changing truths led them to interview many of the \n     key figures in the field--from government ministers and UN \n     administrators to refugees and asylum-seekers at the sharpest \n     end of policy.\n       Because of their true seriousness and refusal to posture, \n     their column reached out to and was read by influential \n     actors and thinkers across a range of bodies and ways of \n     looking at the world, including the military and academic \n     communities, international institutions and activists. Sergio \n     Vieira de Mello was an enthusiastic reader of their work on \n     openDemocracy, recommending it warmly to others (according to \n     reports, Sergio and Arthur were meeting together when the \n     bomb went off).\n       Arthur and Gil's columns for openDemocracy on Iraq were \n     only part of their concern with crises of human displacement, \n     food insecurity, health and shelter deprivation--and how \n     these problems are dealt with (usually inadequately, and \n     often without taking to heart the lessons of the past) by \n     state, humanitarian and other organisations. There was huge \n     and important work to be done here, and for openDemocracy's \n     global membership to engage with. We had hardly begun.\n       We salute Arthur Helton. We will miss him very much. We \n     commit ourselves to building on his work and helping to make \n     real the better world to which he dedicated his life. There \n     is much to do.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From Human Rights Watch, Aug. 20, 2003]\n\n  Human Rights Watch Mourns Death of Refugee Advocate Arthur C.

Mr. President, I join my colleagues in paying tribute to \nformer Senator Vance Hartke of Indiana, who passed away this summer.\n  Throughout his three terms in the Senate, Vance Hartke was known for \nhis tremendous energy, vision, and courage.\n  First elected to the Senate as part of the great Democratic class of \n1958, Vance Hartke campaigned with legendary vigor and vim, visiting \nevery county and town in Indiana and stopping to talk and listen to \neveryone who would stand still. He worked hard to benefit his home \nState, using his chairmanship of the Commerce Transportation \nSubcommittee to bring key road and rail projects to the Hoosier State.\n\n[[Page S11344]]\n\n  Senator Hartke helped enact landmark legislation, including the \nprogressive programs that made up President Lyndon B. Johnson's Great \nSociety. Despite fierce opposition, he helped steer Medicare through \nCongress. He was the Senate's acknowledged champion of higher education \nand adult education, and he also helped lead the efforts to expand \nveterans benefits and establish Federal student loan programs.\n  In the mid-1960s, Senator Hartke put his political future on the line \nwhen he became one of the first Senators to oppose the war in Vietnam. \nIn following his conscience, he parted ways with most of his \nconstituents and his good friend President Johnson, but he stuck to his \nprinciples and survived a bruising reelection campaign in 1970.\n  Though Senator Hartke lost his Senate seat in 1976, he became a good \nfriend and adviser to the man who defeated him, Senator Richard Lugar, \nand he never lost his passion for politics or his home State.\n  Senator Vance Hartke served the people of Indiana and the U.S. Senate \nwith great distinction. I am honored to add my voice to the chorus of \npraise for his life's work and legacy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/10/senate-section/article/S11344-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11344]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    TRIBUTE TO COLORADO STORM ROYAL\n\n Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I want to recognize and \ncongratulate a special group of young Coloradans, the Colorado Storm \nRoyal soccer team.\n  The Colorado Storm Royal is a team in the Under 12 age bracket, U12, \nand they are coached by Mr. Jim Morrison. Mr. Morrison has coached \nColorado youth soccer for the past 17 years and 34 seasons, and has \ntaken his teams to the Western Region tournament eight times. Out of \nthose eight appearances, his teams have reached the final game four \ntimes, losing to California teams three previous times and then winning \nthe Championship this past year.\n  The Colorado Storm Royal had a remarkable record the past 10-month \nperiod, with 35 wins and 0 losses. They played their games at the \nPremier 1 level, which in Colorado is the highest level of competitive \nyouth soccer.\n  Their accomplishments are certainly commendable--Undefeated and \nuntied in 35 straight Premier 1 games in Colorado; Colorado State Cup \nChampions, Western Regional Champions, and they were ranked No. 1 in \nthe United States by National Soccer Rankings.com.\n  The members of this team are all Colorado residents whose families \nlive and work in the Denver area. The commitment by all to make these \naccomplishments a reality is especially worth noting, because unlike \nother areas of the country where teams can practice 365 days of the \nyear, we don't have that same luxury in Colorado. So the boys and their \nfamilies make a concentrated effort to not only remain active in school \nand throughout the community but also to get to a more limited practice \nschedule.\n  There are 16 individuals on the Colorado Storm Royal team, and I \nbelieve they deserve to be mentioned here today. They are: Anise \nAbdulgasem, Junior Amaya, Cody Arnold, John Ellison, Matt Hammet, \nMatthew Hustead, Chris Klebieko, Tyler Lister, Andrew Love, Dirk \nMacDonald, Matthew Nier, Augustus Ogu, Ryan Rombach, Brendan Roslund, \nPeter Walker and Charlie Zeller.\n  To these outstanding young players, their families, their coaches, \nand their supporters, I offer my most sincere congratulations on a \nwinning season and my best wishes for another outstanding season of \nColorado soccer. They are examples of what hard work and determination \nbring when we set ourselves to achieving goals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/10/senate-section/article/S11344-2", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11344]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      IN TRIBUTE TO GEORGE GARRIS\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, this month George Garris, the \nlongest serving refuge manager in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, \nannounced he will be retiring and I rise to salute him. There's no \nquestion in my mind that George has done more to protect the wildlife \nin my State than anyone I know. He is the Teddy Roosevelt of South \nCarolina.\n  For years George has been telling me he would retire as soon as he \nfinished this one project. Then he would find another project--and the \nsame thing, he was going to retire when it was done. This went on and \non for years and years. It went on because George wanted to leave \nfuture generations something good. He pushed to save thousands of acres \nof natural habitats in my State. Years from now when we still enjoy \nSouth Carolina's natural beauty, we can thank George Garris.\n  George began his productive career in the Fish and Wildlife Service \nin 1959, and today is the steward of four South Carolina Lowcountry \nrefuges that he helped create or expand--the ACE Basin, the Santee and \nWaccamaw Refuges, and Cape Romain. He also successfully saved both the \nendangered red wolf and loggerhead sea turtles.\n  We will miss George, and I know all the Members of this body join me \nin thanking him for his esteemed public service and wishing him \nhappiness and good health in the years ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/10/senate-section/article/S11344-3", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11344]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          VA MARKS THE 30TH ANNIVERSARY OF ITS CEMETERY SYSTEM\n\n Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, today I rise to \ncelebrate 30 years of the VA cemetery system. ``Celebrate'' may seem a \nstrange word to use in reference to something so closely tied with \nmourning, but it is appropriate that we do just that. VA's national \ncemetery system is one of its most precious resources, providing our \nveterans the final respect and honor they have earned.\n  VA's operation of the National Cemetery Administration dates from \nSeptember 1, 1973, when Congress transferred control of the national \ncemeteries from the Department of Army to what was then the Veterans \nAdministration. Those cemeteries joined the ones already operated by \nVA, and the National Cemetery System--now the National Cemetery \nAdministration--was created.\n  America's history of providing a final resting place to our veterans \nextends back before 1973, when the Civil War left hundreds of thousands \nof soldiers dead. In the spirit of Abraham Lincoln's words that the \nNation must ``care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his \nwidow and his orphan,'' Congress established national cemeteries in \norder to fulfill that commitment.\n  Today, the National Cemetery Administration ensures that our veterans \nhave a proper burial and maintains the national cemeteries as shrines \nto their memory. Since taking over the national cemetery system, VA has \nseen an increase in annual burials from 36,400 to a record 89,300 in \n2002. More and more veterans are choosing to be laid to rest in \nnational cemeteries than ever before. This choice is a testament to the \ndevotion that the employees of the VA's National Cemetery \nAdministration show in performing their duties.\n  In noting the importance of the National Cemetery Administration and \nin honoring its extensive history, I must also point to the need to \nensure its future. Nearly 655,000 veteran are expected to die this \nyear, and even more will die in each of the next 5 years. By the end of \n2004, only 64 of the 124 veterans national cemeteries will be available \nfor both casketed and cremated remains. As cemetery capacity decreases, \nveterans in areas near those closing cemeteries lose access to burial \noptions. In order to ensure that proper funeral honors are provided for \nveterans and their family members, we must develop new cemeteries and \nexpand existing cemeteries. In such cities as Birmingham, AL; \nBakersfield, CA; Columbia/Greenville, SC; Philadelphia, PA; and, in my \nown State, Sarasota and Jacksonville, FL, more than 175,000 veterans in \neach of these areas are currently without full burial options. We must \nensure that their sacrifice is honored.\n  One of the most difficult things we do is cope with the death of \nsomeone we love. By guaranteeing a burial that befits the sacrifice of \nour Nation's soldiers, the National Cemetery Administration mitigates \nsome of that pain and commemorates the service and lives of our \nveterans.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/10/senate-section/article/S11345-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11345]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S11345]]\n                    IN RECOGNITION OF FERN BELLMORE\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it is with great pride that I pay \ntribute to an extraordinary American who has shown great commitment to \nfurthering the democratic process. On September 13, Fern Bellmore will \nbe presented with the Daune Weiss award at the Northern Michigan County \nDemocratic Party Dinner, also known as the ``Bash.'' Fern has worked \ntirelessly, raised a family, been actively involved in her community, \nand made great contributions in the political arena throughout her life \nand continues to do so to this day.\n  In November, Fern and her husband, Robert, will celebrate 52 years of \nmarriage surrounded by their 5 children, 11 grandchildren, and 5 great-\ngrandchildren. In addition to raising a family, Fern also worked for 22 \nyears at Cadillac Products in Alpena, MI. While working at Cadillac \nProducts, Fern was pivotal in the unionization of the shop for the \nUnited Steelworkers and continued to be an active union member after \nher retirement.\n  Fern's commitment to her community is evident through her continued \ninvolvement with several organizations. For many years she has been an \nactive den mother for Cub Scouts, working with area youth to inspire \nand influence the future generations of this country. She has also \nworked closely with the American Cancer Society, Hospice, and The \nAmerican Red Cross. Locally, Fern has served for many years, some as \nchair, on the Presque Isle County Board of Canvassers and is currently \non the Board of Social Service for Presque Isle County.\n  Fern has been active in the Democratic Party for over 20 years. \nDuring the majority of this time she was the Chair of the Presque Isle \nCounty Democratic Party. She helped establish the ``Bash'' in her \ndetermination to increase participation in elections for State \nrepresentatives for Presque Isle County. Fern has also worked on \nnumerous campaigns for local, State, and national candidates.\n  Fern's unwavering support of her community and continued dedication \nto the democratic process has benefited citizens throughout northern \nMichigan and the entire State. Her commitment as a community leader and \ngrassroots political activist has been a true inspiration to others \naround her. I am pleased to congratulate her on receiving the Daune \nWeiss award and salute Fern Bellmore for her service to the community \nas an outstanding citizen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/10/senate-section/article/S11345-2", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11345]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          JOSEPH AND VIVIAN SAFRANEK 60TH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Joseph and \nVivian Safranek, long-time residents of Wisconsin, on their 60th \nwedding anniversary. Joseph and Vivian met at the Pine Mountain Ski \ntournament in 1942 when Joseph offered Vivian a ride in his \nconvertible. It was the beginning of an incredible journey.\n  The couple was married at Kingsford's Our Redeemer Lutheran Church on \nSeptember 18, 1943. After living in the Upper Peninsula, Joseph and \nVivian moved to Milwaukee in 1950. Life wasn't always easy; money was \ntight, and they had four children to raise. But from the beginning, \nthey persisted by supporting each other with lasting love and devotion.\n  Joseph worked for over 30 years as a route salesman, first at \nMilwaukee Cheese Company, then at Continental Baking. He knew my dad, \nand remembers me as ``one of Max's boys.''\n  Today, many years later, their story continues. Their four children \nhave grown up to be successful adults themselves, providing Joseph and \nVivian with seven grandchildren and soon, their first great-grandchild. \nTheir legacy is one of hard-work, determination, and a strong family.\n  I join their many friends and their family in celebration as we honor \nJoseph and Vivian Safranek on their 60th wedding anniversary. They are \nthe very best Wisconsin has to offer, and I wish them continued joy and \nhappiness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/10/senate-section/article/S11345-3", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11345]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/10/senate-section/article/S11345-4", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11345]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/10/senate-section/article/S11345-5", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11345]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREPORT RELATIVE TO THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO THE TERRORIST \n                  ATTACKS OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001--PM 48\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act, 50 U.S.C. 1622(d), \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nprior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President \npublishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a \nnotice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the \nanniversary date.

A bill to authorize major medical facility projects for the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs in connection with the Capital Asset \nRealignment for Enhanced Services initiative and to satisfy Department \nof Veterans Affairs requirements on natural disasters, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nwould authorize the construction of new veterans' hospitals in east-\ncentral Florida and Las Vegas, NV. In addition, the legislation would \nenable the Department of Veterans Affairs, VA, Medical Center in San \nJuan, Puerto Rico, to sustain operations in the event of a natural \ndisaster, such as an earthquake.\n  For years now, VA has been under a sort of moratorium for new \nconstruction projects. This was due to the capital asset realignment \nfor enhanced services, CARES, process, which is designed to examine \nVA's infrastructure and try to realign it to better meet the projected \nneeds of veterans. Many here in Congress were understandably reluctant \nto invest any valuable dollars in a facility that may ultimately be \nslated for downsizing.\n  However, the CARES process is now nearing its end. The CARES \nCommission is in the process of reviewing the national draft plan \ndeveloped by the Under Secretary for Health, and Commissioners will \nmake their recommendations to the Secretary by the end of November. The \nSecretary will then make his final decisions on what plans will be \nimplemented by the end of the year.\n  Included in the national draft plan were two major construction \ninitiatives: a new hospital and clinic in Las Vegas, NV, and a new \nfacility in east-central Florida. In light of the fact that these two \nprojects are the only new hospitals included in the draft plan, and \nthat the great need in both of these areas has been well documented, \nthe sooner we can get these facilities up and running, the better.\n  Veterans living in east-central Florida are in dire need of a full-\nfledged VA hospital. One VA report found that since 1996, ``the Central \nFlorida market sustained the greatest workload expansion of the entire \nVA system--105 percent.'' Other VA studies have deemed Orlando as ``the \nlogical choice for infrastructure investment for all major Inpatient \nand Outpatient categories.'' The decision about where to place a new VA \nhospital in this region falls to VA, but I encourage Secretary Principi \nto carefully study all the options to ensure that the most appropriate \nlocation is chosen.\n  Las Vegas, in Clark County, NV, was recognized by VA as, `` . . . one \nof the fastest growing markets in the U.S.'' VA also acknowledges that \nthere is a gap in long-term care accessibility in this area, and that \ncontracting in the community is not a viable option as there are \nquality of care issues with the region's private sector facilities. Why \nshould we wait to authorize projects whose necessity is broadly \nrecognized by veterans and VA alike?\n  This legislation would also authorize $30 million for the San Juan VA \nMedical Center to undertake much needed upgrading in order to ensure \nthat patient safety is not unnecessarily jeopardized in the event of an \nearthquake. The money would be used to bring the facility in line with \nthe CD-54 natural disasters directive, enabling vital services to \ncontinue to be provided for 7 to 10 days after a disaster. Services \nthat would be reinforced by this project are primarily utilities, which \nin some cases provide lifesaving support to patients.\n  In 1991, the San Juan VA Medical Center was deemed seismically \nunsound, and other structural deficiencies were uncovered as well. \nAlthough the Carribean is not normally thought of as a seismic ``hot \nspot,'' the islands are mountainous and severe earthquakes do occur \nthere every few decades. The supposed unlikelihood of such an event is \nno reason to not have contingency operations should something actually \noccur. Patient safety is not something that can be gambled with in this \nmanner. It is important that we supply the San Juan VA Medical Center \nwith the additional resources it needs to make sure that no patient has \nto go without life support in the event of a natural disaster. I was \ndisappointed that the San Juan upgrading project was not included in \nVA's draft plan, but regardless, I do believe we have an obligation to \nmake these needed repairs.\n  Finally, I would like to recognize the efforts of my friend Senator \nReid in this initiative, who is also facing a rapidly growing veteran \npopulation in his home State of Nevada. Additionally, I want to thank \nRepresentative Corrine Brown of the Orlando area, Representative \nShelley Berkley of Las Vegas, and Representative Anibal Acevedo-Vila of \nPuerto Rico, who have all been very helpful in developing a companion \nbill in the House.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in this effort for our Nation's \nveterans.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1605\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. AUTHORIZATION OF MAJOR MEDICAL FACILITY PROJECTS.\n\n       The Secretary of Veterans Affairs may carry out the \n     following major medical facility projects, with each project \n     to be carried out in an amount not to exceed the amount \n     specified for that project:\n       (1) Construction of a health care facility at a location in \n     East Central Florida selected by the Secretary, as part of \n     the Capital Asset Realignment for Enhanced Services (CARES) \n     initiative, $170,000,000.\n       (2) Improvements of the Department of Veterans Affairs \n     Medical Center in San Juan, Puerto Rico, in order to bring \n     that facility into compliance with the CD-54 Natural \n     Disasters Directive, $30,000,000.\n       (3) Construction of a health care facility in Las Vegas, \n     Nevada, as part of the Capital Asset Realignment for Enhanced \n     Services initiative, $250,000,000.\n\n     SEC. 2. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--There are authorized to be appropriated \n     for the Secretary of Veterans Affairs for fiscal year 2004 \n     for the Construction, Major Projects, account, a total of \n     $450,000,000 for the projects authorized in section 1.\n       (b) Limitation.--The projects authorized in section 1 may \n     only be carried out using--\n       (1) funds appropriated for fiscal year 2004 pursuant to the \n     authorization of appropriations in subsection (a);\n       (2) funds appropriated for Construction, Major Projects, \n     for a fiscal year before fiscal year 2004 that remain \n     available for obligation; and\n       (3) funds appropriated for Construction, Major Projects, \n     for fiscal year 2004 for a category of activity not specific \n     to a project.\n                                  ____\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I join with my colleague, Senator Graham of \nFlorida, to introduce legislation that authorizes funding for a new \nveterans' hospital, outpatient clinic and senior center in Southern \nNevada. Nevada is now the third most popular retirement State in the \nNation. And many of the retirees who make their homes in Nevada are \nveterans who served our country with courage and honor.\n  More than 240,000 veterans live in Nevada, and more than one-third of \nNevada's residents over age 65 have worn the uniform of the United \nStates. Veterans are the cornerstone of our economy. They are also our \nneighbors, our family members and our friends.\n  As we welcome these veterans, we must also ensure that they can get \nthe services they need--especially medical care. Our veterans put their \nlives on the line for our freedom. They deserve the best health care in \nthe world. But we have been struggling to keep up with our fast-growing \npopulation of veterans.\n  Across the Nation, more than 110,000 veterans have waited more than 6 \nmonths for their first medical appointment with the VA. There have been \nsome backlogs in booming areas like Las Vegas, which has the highest \ngrowth rate in the Nation. This new facility should ease some of these \ndelays and result in improved care for our veterans.\n  I was pleased to learn recently from VA Secretary Anthony Principi \nthat he endorsed the building of a new hospital in southern Nevada. \nThis bill, which was made possible by the strong leadership of Senator \nGraham of Florida, would authorize $250 million to build this sorely \nneeded facility.\n  I realize that we have many urgent priorities today, and our \nresources are not unlimited. But this is a matter of national security. \nWe have soldiers in\n\n[[Page S11353]]\n\nthe desert of Iraq today who volunteered to risk their lives protecting \nour freedom. They willingly put their lives on the line for us. In \nreturn, we make certain promises to them. One of those promises is that \nthey will receive quality health care when they come home. We must keep \nthis promise to our troops.\n  Right now, I am sorry to say, we are not keeping that promise to the \nNation's veterans. This bill will help steer us onto the right course, \nand begin to correct that injustice for the veterans in Southern \nNevada.\n  I urge your support of this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KYL:\n  S. 1606. A bill to strengthen and enhance public safety through \npretrial detention and postrelease supervision of terrorists, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Pretrial \nDetention and Lifetime Supervision of Terrorists Act of 2003,'' \nlegislation that will fill continuing gaps in the laws that our police \nand prosecutors use to protect our Nation from terrorism.\n  Under current Federal law, defendants accused of certain crimes--such \nas drug crimes carrying a potential sentence of ten years or more--are \npresumptively denied pretrial release. This provision of current law, \nhowever, does not apply to terrorists.\n  The legislation that I have introduced today would fix this \noversight, by amending the criminal code to presumptively deny pre-\ntrial release to persons charged with terrorist activity. The \npresumption would apply to Federal crimes of terrorism, as enumerated \nin the criminal code, if the Attorney General certifies that the \noffense, by its nature and context, appears to be intended to \nintimidate or coerce a civilian population, to influence the policy of \na government by intimidation or coercion, or to affect the conduct of a \ngovernment by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping, or an \noffense involved in or related to domestic or international terrorism.\n  Extending the presumption in current law to terrorist offenses is \njustified by the unparalleled magnitude of the threat posed to our \nNation by acts of terrorism. Terrorists are at least as much of a \nthreat as drug dealers--and should also be subject to a presumption of \npre-trial detention.\n  The bill that I have introduced today also would broaden the list of \noffenses that render a convicted terrorist eligible for lifetime \nsupervision subsequent to his release from prison. Currently law allows \nlifetime post-release supervision for terrorist offenses only if they \nresult in or create a foreseeable risk of death or serious injury. This \nlimitation could prevent the imposition of adequate supervision periods \nfor persons convicted of non-violent terrorist offenses, such as a \ncomputer attack on the United States that results in tens of billions \nof dollars of economic damage. It could also limit supervision for \npersons who provide the essential financial or other material support \nfor terrorist acts, but who do not themselves directly engage in \nviolent terrorist acts.\n  The continuing danger posed to our Nation's security by such persons \nmay be no less than that posed by the direct perpetrators of terrorist \nviolence. The courts should be afforded the same degree of discretion \nin prescribing postrelease supervision for these terrorists as for \nothers.\n  For this reason, the bill introduced today eliminates the \nforeseeable-risk-of-injury requirement and allows lifetime supervision \nfor all offenses in the standard list of crimes likely to be committed \nby terrorists and their supporters. This reform reflects the continuing \ndanger posed by convicted terrorists after their completion of a term \nof imprisonment. It recognizes that even those terrorists not directly \ninvolved in the use of violence may continue to harbor a commitment to \nterrorist goals and methods that will not dissipate within a few years \nof release.\n  I look forward to the Senate's consideration of these common-sense \nreforms to our Nation's anti-terror laws.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1606\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 222\n\n       Whereas according to the American Cancer Society, in 2003, \n     211,300 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer and 39,800 \n     women will die from this disease;\n       Whereas it is estimated that about 2,000,000 women were \n     diagnosed with breast cancer in the 1990s, and that in nearly \n     500,000 of those cases, the cancer resulted in death;\n       Whereas African-American women suffer a 30 percent greater \n     mortality from breast cancer than White women and more than a \n     100 percent greater mortality from breast cancer than women \n     from Hispanic, Asian, and American Indian populations;\n       Whereas the risk of breast cancer increases with age, with \n     a woman at age 70 years having twice as much of a chance of \n     developing the disease as a woman at age 50 years;\n       Whereas at least 80 percent of the women who get breast \n     cancer have no family history of the disease;\n       Whereas mammograms, when operated professionally at a \n     certified facility, can provide safe screening and early \n     detection of breast cancer in many women;\n       Whereas mammography is an excellent method for early \n     detection of localized breast cancer, which has a 5-year \n     survival rate of more than 97 percent;\n       Whereas the National Cancer Institute and the American \n     Cancer Society continue to recommend periodic mammograms; and\n       Whereas the National Breast Cancer Coalition recommends \n     that each woman and her health care provider make an \n     individual decision about mammography: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates October 17, 2003, as ``National Mammography \n     Day''; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling upon the people of the\n\n[[Page S11354]]\n\n     United States to observe the day with appropriate programs \n     and activities.\n                                  ____\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a resolution \ndesignating October 17, 2003, as ``National Mammography Day''. I am \npleased that 52 of my colleagues have endorsed this proposal by \nagreeing to be original cosponsors. I might note that I have submitted \na similar resolution each year since 1993, and on each occasion the \nSenate has shown its support for the fight against breast cancer by \napproving the resolution.\n  Each year, as I prepare to submit this resolution, I review the \nlatest information from the American Cancer Society about breast \ncancer. For the year 2003, it is estimated that over 211,000 women will \nbe diagnosed with breast cancer and slightly fewer than 40,000 women \nwill die of this disease.\n  In past years, I have often commented on how gloomy these statistics \nwere. But as I review how these numbers are changing over time, I have \ncome to the realization that it is really more appropriate to be \noptimistic. The number of deaths from breast cancer is actually stable \nor falling from year to year. Early detection of breast cancer \ncontinues to result in extremely favorable outcomes: 97 percent of \nwomen with localized breast cancer will survive 5 years or longer. New \ndigital techniques make the process of mammography much more rapid and \nprecise than before. Government programs will provide free mammograms \nto those who can't afford them, as well as Medicaid eligibility for \ntreatment if breast cancer is diagnosed. Information about treatment of \nbreast cancer with surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy has \nexploded, reflecting enormous research advances in this disease. So I \nam feeling quite positive about our battle against breast cancer. A \ndiagnosis of breast cancer is not a death sentence, and I encounter \nlong-term survivors of breast cancer nearly daily.\n  In recent times, the newspapers have been filled with discussion over \nwhether the scientific evidence actually supports the conclusion that \nperiodic screening mammography saves lives. It seems that much of this \ncontroversy relates to new interpretations of old studies, and the \nrelatively few recent studies of this matter have not clarified this \nissue. Most sources seem to agree that all of the existing scientific \nstudies have some weaknesses, but it is far from clear whether the very \nlarge and truly unambiguous study needed to settle this matter \ndefinitively can ever be done.\n  So what is a woman to do? I do not claim any expertise in this highly \ntechnical area, so I rely on the experts. The American Cancer Society, \nthe National Cancer Institute, and the U.S. Preventive Services Task \nForce all continue to recommend periodic screening mammography, and I \nendorse the statements of these distinguished bodies.\n  On the other hand, I recognize that some women who examine these \nresearch studies are unconvinced of the need for periodic screening \nmammography. However, even those scientists who do not support periodic \nmammography for all women believe that it is appropriate for some \ngroups of women with particular risk factors. In agreement with these \nexperts, I encourage all women who have doubts about the usefulness of \nscreening mammography in general to discuss with their individual \nphysicians whether this test is appropriate in their specific \nsituations.\n  So my message to women is: have a periodic mammogram, or at the very \nleast discuss this option with your own physician.\n  I know that some women don't have annual mammograms because of either \nfear or forgetfulness. It is only human nature for some women to avoid \nmammograms because they are afraid of what they will find. To those who \nare fearful, I would say that if you have periodic routine mammograms, \nand the latest one comes out positive, even before you have any \nsymptoms or have found a lump on self-examination, you have reason to \nbe optimistic, not pessimistic. Such early-detected breast cancers are \nhighly treatable.\n  Then there is forgetfulness. I certainly understand how difficult it \nis to remember to do something that only comes around once each year. I \nwould suggest that this is where ``National Mammography Day'' comes in. \nOn that day, let's make sure that each woman we know picks a specific \ndate on which to get a mammogram each year, a date that she won't \nforget: a child's birthday, an anniversary, perhaps even the day her \ntaxes are due. On National Mammography Day, let's ask our loved ones: \npick one of these dates, fix it in your mind along with a picture of \nyour child, your wedding, or another symbol of that date, and promise \nyourself to get a mammogram on that date every year. Do it for yourself \nand for the others that love you and want you to be part of their lives \nfor as long as possible.\n  And to those women who are reluctant to have a mammogram, I say let \nNational Mammography Day serve as a reminder to discuss this question \neach year with your physician. New scientific studies that are \npublished and new mammography techniques that are developed may affect \nyour decision on this matter from one year to the next. I encourage you \nto keep an open mind and not to feel that a decision at one point in \ntime commits you irrevocably to a particular course of action for the \nindefinite future.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in the ongoing fight against breast \ncancer by cosponsoring and voting for this resolution to designate \nOctober 17, 2003, as National Mammography Day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/10/senate-section/article/S11354-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11354-S11355]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 223--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT THE LIFE \nAND ACHIEVEMENTS OF ANTONIO MEUCCI SHOULD BE RECOGNIZED, AND FOR OTHER \n                                PURPOSES\n\n  Mr. CORZINE submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution to \nrecognize the life and achievements of Antonio Meucci, an Italian-\nAmerican inventor who had both an extraordinary and a tragic career. \nMr. Meucci made a great contribution as a pioneer in the\n\n[[Page S11355]]\n\ndevelopment of the telephone, and his legacy deserves recognition.\n  Born in 1808 in Florence, Italy, Antonio Meucci showed academic \npromise from an early age. After being educated at the Academy of Fine \nArts, he rose to the position of assistant to the chief engineer for a \nleading Florentine theater. In 1835, he was recruited by a famous \nentrepreneur to work as chief engineer for a new theater in Havana, \nCuba. There he began work on many of his inventions, including those \nrelating to telephonic communication.\n  Meucci left Havana for the United States in 1850 in search of a \nbetter environment to develop his ideas relating to the telephone. In \n1854, after his wife had fallen ill, Mr. Meucci set up a rudimentary \ncommunication link known as a ``speaking telegraph'' that connected her \nbedroom to his basement laboratory and the rest of his home.\n  Mr. Meucci spent the next several years trying to advance his idea, \nand his efforts culminated in December 1871, when he hired an attorney \nto secure a patent caveat, a 1-year renewable notice of an impending \npatent, which reflected the promise of his work on the telephone. \nAlthough Mr. Meucci retained the caveat for 3 years, he was unable to \nproduce the necessary $10 renewal fee after 1874.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. Meucci died before he was able to complete his \nefforts. However, his work has not gone completely unnoticed. On the \n100th anniversary of the telephone, both the Smithsonian Institution \nand the International Telecommunication Union honored Mr. Meucci as \namong the most important pioneers of the telephone.\n  Given his important contributions, I hope my colleagues will join in \nhonoring both the life and achievements of Antonio Meucci.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/10/senate-section/article/S11355-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11355]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1604.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S11362]]\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, in part of this bill was language that \nrequires the CDC to develop a plan to deal with the medical \ntransmission of AIDS in Africa. The science is coming in clearer and \nclearer that a substantial portion of the infections in Africa result \nfrom transmissions from blood transfusions or the reuse of needles for \ninjections.\n  In fact, we believe the World Health Organization numbers say that 10 \npercent are caused by it. That means as many as 300,000 infections in \nAfrica are, in fact, a death sentence caused by unsafe medical \npractices. We need to end that. We can end that.\n  We have had two hearings I have conducted. It is a moral crisis. It \nshould not be allowed to continue. Our medical agencies, including \nHealth and Human Services, CDC, and particularly WHO, have been slow to \nrespond. My remarks go into great detail about the science behind this. \nIt has raised the concern of human rights groups as well as health \ngroups. We will continue to proceed. We will be discussing in more \ndepth the need for focus.\n  By WHO's own number, they can virtually eliminate this problem for \nless than $100 million a year. We will be spending $3 billion a year \nwhen the AIDS program in Africa is rolling. We can fund this. We can \neliminate this and 300,000 people a year being infected would be \nstopped. There are even studies that show 670,000 Africans in South \nAfrica from the age of 2 to 14 are now infected by HIV, much of that \nfrom unsafe health practices. It is a dilemma for us. We have to act \nquickly and not delay.\n  As this Congress takes up the task of funding a landmark global \neffort to combat HIV/AIDS, it is imperative that lawmakers consider an \naspect of this crisis that has consistently not received the prominence \nit deserves.\n  I would like to thank Senator Specter for his help in bringing this \nissue to light during our consideration of appropriations for the \nDepartments of Labor and HHS.\n  While we are all aware of many excellent programs that seek to treat \nthis virus or prevent its transmission, it is widely unrecognized that, \neven by conservative estimates, each day 1,000 Africans who go to \nhospitals, clinics, or local doctors seeking treatment come away \ninfected with a deadly disease.\n  They contract this virus through unsafe injections given with needles \nand syringes that are often reused again and again, or through \ncontaminated transfusions with blood that is never screened for HIV, \nhepatitis B, hepatitis C, or other potentially deadly diseases.\n  In March of this year, the Washington Times reported that Dr. David \nGisselquist and his colleague John Potterat had published an article in \nthe International Journal of STD & AIDS, a publication of the British \nRoyal Society of Medicine, that presented evidence that the reuse of \nneedles and syringes has played a major role in the African HIV/AIDS \nepidemic.\n  This article challenged the conventional wisdom in the international \npublic health community that heterosexual contact is the primary route \nof transmission for HIV in Africa and that medical transmission of the \ndisease did not require its foremost attention.\n  Dr. Gisselquist pointed to a number of pieces of evidence supporting \nhis conclusion that medical exposures account for a large proportion of \nHIV transmission.\n  Dr. Gisselquist conducted an extensive review of refereed journal \narticles on the epidemiology of the African HIV epidemic. A careful \nanalysis of the data behind these studies enabled him to identify the \nfollowing trends:\n  Multiple studies found HIV-infected children whose mothers test \nnegative for the virus. Many of these children are far too young to \nhave contracted HIV through sexual practices or drug use, leaving their \ninfections unexplained by conventional assumptions about the spread of \nthis disease.\n  It was found, however, that these children bearing the HIV virus had, \non average, received nearly twice as many injections of vaccines and \nmedicines than their uninfected peers, leading researchers to conclude \nthat there was a strong correlation between the number of injections a \nchild received and that child's chances of contracting HIV.\n  International groups involved in large-scale vaccination campaigns \nhave long realized that injection safety is an indispensable element of \ntheir work. This realization followed events such as the tremendous \nepidemic of hepatitis C in Egypt following a nationwide effort to \nvaccinate against schistosomiasis.\n  This is still thought to represent ``the world's largest iatrogenic \ntransmission event,'' contributing to an appalling 18 percent \nprevalence of the deadly hepatitis C virus in the Egyptian population.\n  Since the recognition that unsafe injections pose an unacceptable \nrisk in vaccination campaigns, international efforts now almost \nuniversally include adequate injection safety training and supplies. \nThese limited efforts are commendable but more needs to be done.\n  To understand the proportion of the problem that remains to be \naddressed, one must note the distinction between injections given for \nvaccinations and therapeutic injections, or injections given for the \npurpose of treating infections or other disease processes.\n  It has been estimated that worldwide, therapeutic injections \noutnumber vaccinations by about nine to one, totaling approximately 12 \nbillion injections administered each year in the developing world, \nincluding the African nations of the global AIDS initiative.\n  Despite this fact, and the demonstrated risks associated with unsafe \ninjections, leaders in the field of HIV prevention have warned that \n``little attention has been paid to the systematic correction of \nwidespread unsafe practices resulting in disease transmission through \ntherapeutic injections.''\n  There are so many tragic aspects of this problem:\n  Hard-working frontline doctors and nurses inadvertently contribute to \nthe spread of the very diseases they are struggling to treat;\n  The health care system in developing nations frequently does not \nprovide either necessary education in proper injection practices or, \nfor those providers who are striving to follow model practices, the \nrelatively inexpensive supplies necessary to succeed;\n  Citizens come to trusted institutions for medical treatment for \nthemselves, or for their children, and are unknowingly infected.\n  Ironically, these people do not, based on present AIDS prevention \neducation, have any reason to view themselves as high-risk. They have \nnot engaged in unsafe sex or intravenous drug use--they have merely \nacted responsibly and gone to the doctor.\n  Subsequently, these victims go home and, again unknowingly, pass HIV \nor other deadly diseases to their own families--husbands to wives, \nwives to husbands, mothers to children.\n  In this manner, this ``hidden'' source of disease transmission \ncontinues to fuel the epidemic, capitalizing on a large blind spot in \nthe current HIV prevention orthodoxy.\n  At the outset of the AIDS epidemic in the United States, both the \nU.S. Government and the public declared that the blood supply must be \nrendered absolutely safe.\n  The Federal Government and the public health community moved rapidly \nto ensure that every singe unit of blood donated in this country is \ntested for the HIV virus.\n  It is estimated that 25 percent of blood donated in Africa is never \ntested for HIV and that up to 80 percent is never tested for hepatitis.\n  It is estimated by the respected group, Safe Blood for Africa, that \nas a consequence of this breakdown, approximately 15 percent of the \nsub-Saharan African blood supply is infected with HIV and 20 percent \nwith hepatitis.\n  The World Health Organization estimates that up to 10 percent of new \nHIV cases in Africa may be due to contaminated blood transfusions.\n  Once again, it is clear that transfusions of contaminated blood \nresult in yet another ``hidden'' source of disease transmission fueling \nthis epidemic.\n  Seventy percent of the recipients of these high-risk transfusions are \nwomen and children, making blood safety a crucial component of our \nlarger effort to fight HIV/AIDS in mothers and children.\n  This figure is linked to the high incidence in Africa of malaria, \nwhich frequently causes severe anemia, particularly in children, and of \nsevere postpartum bleeding. It is important to recognize, too, that \neven in the treatment of anemia related to these common conditions, \nbest medical practices\n\n[[Page S11363]]\n\nwould dictate that many of these transfusions are unnecessary.\n  This is just one more example of the potential to decrease the risk \nto people of deadly infection, as well as the considerable cost of \nthese unnecessary transfusions through educating providers on simple \nguidelines for transfusion.\n  This administration, and our respected majority leader, Dr. Bill \nFrist, have declared that ending the mother-to-child transmission of \nHIV is of the utmost importance in the overall global AIDS initiative.\n  One of the most startling facts about the healthcare transmission of \nHIV in Africa is the fact that injection safety and blood safety have \nbeen specifically singled out by researchers as the most cost-effective \nmeans of preventing the spread of HIV.\n  A study published by the WHO in 1999 suggested that addressing the \nproblem of unsafe injections might well result in actual savings for \nthe governments and organizations financing the fight against AIDS. \nThese savings would be generated both by a reduction in the number of \nunnecessary injections, which, amazingly, may account for a majority of \ntherapeutic injections actually given in the developing world, and by \navoiding the tremendous financial drain associated with the averted \ninfections.\n  In testimony before the HELP committee at a hearing I chaired in \nJuly, one of the leading WHO researchers confirmed both his own \nconclusion that ending unsafe injection practices would be eminently \ncost-effective and his projection that blood safety efforts would prove \nto be similarly so.\n  As noted previously, the World Health Organization's Department of \nBlood Safety and Clinical Technology has, working with a variety of \ngroups, produced a strong body of research on both injection safety and \nblood safety in Africa.\n  At my urging, the Department of Health and Human Services has \nundertaken the task of reviewing all of the available data to better \ndefine the true magnitude of health care transmission through unsafe \ninjections. At this very moment, the Research Triangle Institute, the \nprivate clinical research organization awarded the contract for this \nstudy, is working toward this goal.\n  The results of this study will be reviewed by an independent panel of \nexperts in the field, and I am pleased to note that we do anxiously \nawait the results of this analysis, which is due to be completed next \nmonth.\n  My eagerness to see action on this problem is fueled by evidence that \nthere have been some real successes on the ground in Africa, in some of \nthe poorest nations in the world:\n  In Burkina Faso, where in 1995 it was estimated that injection \nequipment was reused at rates ranging from 20 percent in urban areas to \nan appalling 90 percent in rural regions, the answer was supply. When \nadequate disposable injection equipment was available through community \npharmacies, the rate of reuse dropped 92 percent within 5 years.\n  At the HELP committee hearing I chaired on July 31, it was very \nencouraging to hear the testimony of Dr. John Ssemakula a physician \nfrom Uganda, who was able to describe the great strides his country has \nmade in cleaning up injection practices. Dr. Ssemakula was also able to \nconvey the plea of the dedicated men and women on the frontlines of \nhealth care in Uganda--that they be provided with the equipment they \nneed to provide safe injections.\n  These are intelligent, well-educated, well-intentioned people and \nthey simply want enough syringes to provide their patients with safe \ncare.\n  I have been pleased, over the past several months, to have had the \nopportunity to express my concerns to Randall Tobias, the incoming \nGlobal AIDS Coordinator at the State Department, and to Dr. Joe \nO'Neill, director of the White House Office of National AIDS policy and \nthe new deputy coordinator and chief medical officer in the office of \nthe coordinator.\n  I hope that these gentlemen came away with a good understanding of \nthe crucial importance of addressing the healthcare transmission of \nHIV, and I look forward to continuing to work with the administration \nand other key parties to the global AIDS effort.\n  One of the greatest disappointments I have encountered in my effort \nto draw attention and resources to this problem has been the response \nof the leadership of the World Health Organization.\n  That being said, groups within the World Health Organization continue \nto do commendable work in the area of healthcare transmission, \nincluding Department of Blood Safety and Clinical Technology, which has \nmade progress in the area of blood safety and, within this department, \nthe Safe Injection Global Network, which is a pioneer in the field of \ninjection safety.\n  The disconnect between the good work being done by committed people \nwithin this organization and the determined resistance of leadership to \neven acknowledging that this is a substantial problem is really \nappalling.\n  The World Health Organization and a number of other major public \nhealth entities responded to Dr. Gisselquist's conclusions not as an \ninvitation to reassess their data, but instead mounted a defensive \nresponse that consisted of an unyielding insistence on their own, \nadmittedly conservative figures and a campaign to discredit Dr. \nGisselquist.\n  At the very World Health Organization conference where its own \nresearchers were presenting evidence that healthcare transmission is a \nmore substantial problem that prior WHO numbers would suggest, the \nleadership insisted on releasing a public statement that the \norganization stands by its own previous numbers--even in light of its \nown latest research suggesting otherwise.\n  At the HELP Committee hearing I chaired on this subject in July, \nHolly Burkhalter of Physicians for Human Rights joined a host of \nrespected witnesses in testifying that the healthcare transmission of \nHIV is a problem that must be addressed within the Global AIDS \ninitiative. Ms. Burkhalter and her colleague Dr. Eric Friedman \nsubsequently authored an opinion piece that was run in the Washington \nPost following the hearing that eloquently reiterated this point.\n  It was shocking to once again open the paper to find that the World \nHealth Organization again declined to lead on the issue of healthcare \ntransmission, an area in which its own researchers are pioneers. \nInstead, they opted for a competing opinion piece minimizing the \nproblem and opposing the devotion of any additional resources.\n  As things stand at present, there is still no comprehensive USAID or \nadministration plan to address the healthcare transmission of HIV. I \nhave not been made aware of any plan to address injection safety at \nall, outside the context of vaccination programs.\n  Through appropriations directed to USAID, the Global Fund, and the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, the United States Congress \nrepresents the single greatest source of funding for the international \neffort to combat HIV/AIDS. In this capacity, the Congress must require \nthat these funds are accompanied by a moral commitment to apply \nresources wisely.\n  It is clear that doing so requires promptly acknowledging and \naddressing the issue of the healthcare transmission of HIV.\n  The CDC, through its Global AIDS Program and a variety of other \nefforts at home and abroad, has accumulated important experience in the \nprevention of the healthcare transmission of HIV.\n  This agency provided leadership in ensuring the safety of the U.S. \nblood supply during the early days of the HIV epidemic here, \ncontributing to the development of one of the world's finest and safest \nblood banking systems. The CDC continues to provide expertise and \nsupport of a multitude of international efforts to promote blood \nsafety.\n  In the area of injection safety, the CDC has strongly backed efforts \nto ensure that every injection given in U.S. hospitals and clinics is a \nsafe injection.\n  Overseas, the agency has supported groups such as the WHO's Safe \nInjection Global Network, which has conducted important research on \nsafe injection practices in the developing world and also works to \ndisseminate information essential to the implementation of successful \ninjection safety programs.\n  At a time when the United States is launching an unprecedented \ncampaign against HIV/AIDS in Africa and the Caribbean, the CDC is thus \nuniquely\n\n[[Page S11364]]\n\npositioned to provide the administration and Congress with important \nguidance in launching the most effective effort possible to end the \nhealthcare transmission of HIV.\n  While there are a multitude of programs, many of them CDC-supported, \naddressing various aspects of the healthcare transmission problem, \nthere has been an ongoing failure to launch a coordinated effort to \nintervene to change conditions on the ground in the African region.\n  A hallmark of the President's Global AIDS plan has been a commitment \nto effective coordination and application of resources. This commitment \nmust be extended to ensuring that we put an end, right now, to the \nappalling daily toll taken by unsafe injections and contaminated blood \ntransfusions in Africa.\n  The CDC must again take the lead in moving quickly and energetically \nto outline a plan to comprehensively address injection safety and blood \nsafety in the African nations included in the Global AIDS initiative.\n  This plan must reflect our intent to intervene in this problem \nimmediately. It must include an assessment of the status of the health \ncare system and existing programs in these countries, but it must also \nmove beyond this initial assessment stage to outline the supply and \nlogistical requirements that we will need to understand to move forward \nwith real, on-the-ground interventions.\n  Experts in the field of injection safety suggest that an effective \ninjection safety program must address not only the provision and \ndistribution of safe injection equipment, preferably nonreusuable \nautodisable syringes, but also national-level planning, the education \nof providers and the public in the appropriate and safe use of \ninjections, and an appropriate program for waste disposal.\n  Similarly, a strong blood safety program must not only provide rapid \naccess to accurate test kits, but also staff training, quality \nassurance, and a national-level program to ensure an effective system \nof donor selection, blood screening, and appropriate utilization of \nblood products.\n  Thankfully, these things have all been done before. Moreover, they \nhave been done before by the Centers for Disease Control. It is time \nthat past lessons be applied to the problem before us today, that of \nthe healthcare transmission of HIV.\n  While we may eagerly anticipate the CDC's contribution, in the form \nof a strong plan, to be submitted to Congress within 90 days, the \ninterim must not be marked by inaction.\n  This issue will be before us again soon, when the Senate considers \nthe Foreign Operations appropriations bill, which includes the bulk of \nthe administration's requested appropriations to fund the global AIDS \ninitiative.\n  I intend to ensure that at that time, the issue of the healthcare \ntransmission of HIV in Africa is not neglected within the greater war \non HIV/AIDS.\n  We have reached an important historical point in the global AIDS \nepidemic, a point at which the world's leaders have stepped forward to \nacknowledge the scope of the problem, and its tragedy.\n  I would like to offer the caution that this tragedy becomes a \ntravesty when the leaders in the global effort are offered clear \nevidence that intervention is needed, yet continue to allow death \nsentences to be handed to 1,000 men, women, and children every day \nthrough their inaction.\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}]
