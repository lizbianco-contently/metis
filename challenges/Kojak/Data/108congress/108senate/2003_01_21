This morning there will be a period for morning \nbusiness not to extend beyond the hour of 10:30 a.m., with the time \nequally divided in the usual form. At 10:30, the Senate will then \nresume consideration of H.J. Res. 2, the appropriations bill. I \nunderstand there are several Members on the other side of the aisle who \nintend to offer their amendments to the appropriations measure during \nTuesday's session.\n  In addition to considering further amendments to the appropriations \nmeasure, it is the majority leader's hope that on Tuesday the Senate \nwill consider the nomination of Tom Ridge to be Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity. I believe some Members have indicated their desire to speak \nin regard to that nomination. A rollcall vote is anticipated.\n  At the hour of 5:15, the Senate will vote on S. 121, the AMBER Alert \nbill. This will be the first vote of today's session. Additional votes \nare expected during today.\n  As a reminder, Senators have until 6 p.m. today to file their first-\ndegree amendments to the appropriations bill.\n  Finally, I announce to Members that they should expect busy sessions \neach day this week in the hopes of completing action on the \nappropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, if I could direct a couple of questions to \nthe distinguished Senator from Kentucky, we have a number of people, as \non my colleague's side I am sure, who are catching planes and getting \nback after the Martin Luther King holiday. Does the leader have any \nidea how late he wants to stay in today?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I have not spoken with him this morning, but my \nassumption is we would like to make as much progress as we can toward \ncompleting the bill. Obviously, the longer we remain on this bill, the \nless opportunity we have to move ahead with the work of the year in \nwhich we find ourselves. As the Senator knows, we are still wrapping up \nlast year's work.\n  Mr. REID. We have one Senator coming to offer an amendment at 10:30. \nWe have another Senator coming at 11:30 or quarter to 12. We are going \nto try to move as many amendments as we can today, and hopefully the \nSenators will agree on both sides that we could have votes on those \nmatters this evening. So\n\n[[Page S1170]]\n\nwe will do the best we can to keep things moving.\n  If the Senator can give us some idea as to how late the Senate leader \nwants to go this evening, it would be appreciated.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from Nevada, I am sure that later \nin the day we will be able to provide some further information on that \nmatter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/21/senate-section/article/S1170-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1170]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last night my wife and I watched the \nreplaying of the speech of Dr. Martin Luther King on CNN. The speech \nlasted 17 minutes. No matter how many times I watch the speech, I am so \nimpressed with the message this man delivered. That is why I was \nstunned today, in getting the Congressional News Briefing, to see what \nthe present President, President Bush, has done to undermine the unity \nand harmony of our society.\n  I quote:\n\n       Bush Revives House Participation in Confederate Memorial \n     Ceremony. Last Memorial Day, for the second year in a row, \n     Bush's White House sent a floral wreath to the Confederate \n     Memorial. . . . Bush has quietly reinstated a tradition \n     dating back to Woodrow Wilson that his father had halted in \n     1990. . . . The current Bush White House denies any change in \n     policy. Time adds that one of the organizations connected to \n     the ceremony is the Sons of Confederate Veterans, whose Chief \n     Aide-de-Camp is Richard T. Hines, a politically active \n     lobbyist from South Carolina. In that State's brutal 2000 \n     Republican primary, Hines reportedly helped finance tens of \n     thousands of letters blasting Bush rival Senator John McCain \n     for failing to support the flying of the Confederate flag \n     over the state capitol.\n\n  This repayment of political debt that the President has in South \nCarolina is certainly something that flies in the face of what America \nis all about. It certainly flies in the face of what leaders of the \nadministration says they are trying to do.\n  Yesterday we celebrated a national holiday, the birthday of a great \nAmerican, Dr. King. This year in particular, with controversy over \nremarks and votes related to issues of race having affected the Senate \nitself, it is important that we reflect on the life, legacy, and \nmessage of Dr. King and that we assess the Nation's progress in \nachieving the goals he articulated. Dr. King shared with us his dream \nfor American society, that Blacks, Latinos, Native Americans, and other \nminorities would have equal opportunity to achieve and to contribute.\n\n  We are closer to that place in time because of the efforts and \naccomplishments of Dr. King and others who made sacrifices and \nconfronted enormous obstacles to make life better, not only for African \nAmericans but all Americans.\n  America has made strides in improving the status of ethnic and racial \nminorities, but I am concerned that the policies that the current \nadministration is pursuing would set us back.\n  Dr. King is one of the main reasons that little girls, young ladies, \nteenagers, and women in college can participate in athletics. Title IX \nis civil rights legislation and a direct result of the activities of \nDr. King. Is Title IX an affirmative action program? Of course it is. \nYoung women should have the opportunity to participate in athletics \njust as young men have had. Until we passed a Federal law, an \naffirmative action law, that was not possible. Now, tens of millions of \nyoung women participate in athletics. They have opportunities to build \ntheir character as young men have had for hundreds of years. Now women \ncan participate in athletics.\n  I was disappointed we had to work this week because I was looking \nforward to watching my granddaughter Savannah play basketball this \nweek. She is good. She leads her team in scoring. I have not been able \nto watch her play. She is 10 years old, and in her first game she \nscored 12 of the 22 points her team scored. I was looking forward to \nwatching her play. I am told she is really good. In just a couple of \nyears this little girl will be able to participate in high school \nathletics, which did not happen in my generation. The only athletics my \ngranddaughters could participate in, if they were my age, and even \nyounger than I, would be cheerleadering. Now she can be a basketball \nplayer, soccer player, and participate in track events. That is the way \nit should be.\n  We have made great strides in improving the status of minorities, as \nwell as women. That is the way it should be. We must continue to move \nforward to build on the foundation Dr. King helped establish.\n  But unfortunately the administration is blocking progress by pursuing \npolicies that limit opportunity. One example is this administration's \nfiling a brief in the Supreme Court opposing the ability of the \nUniversity of Michigan to have a diverse class of students.\n  The University of Michigan admissions system is not about quotas. It \nis about improving the educational experience for all students. This \ntakes into account not only race and ethnic background but many other \nfactors. Athletes and others with talents the school finds desirable \nare given extra points in the admission process. The administration did \nnot oppose Michigan and other university programs where they give \nbonuses to alumni, where they give bonuses to athletics. No one opposes \nthat. If you are trying to develop and establish a diverse class of \nstudents at a university, they oppose it. This is wrong. Diversity is a \ngood thing, and it does not happen automatically but requires \nprogressive policies. The administration is flat-out wrong to oppose \nthis.\n  The administration is also wrong in continuing to nominate judges \nwhose records reveal a pattern of insensitivity to racial issues. I \nhave encouraged the President, as have many others, to protect the \nenvironment. Apparently though, the only recycling he favors is \nrecycling of rejected and flawed judicial nominees.\n  What about DC statehood? We have young men and women who live in the \nDistrict of Columbia, who are now in the Persian Gulf getting ready to \ngo to war--people are being called up, being called upon to put their \nlife on the line for their country--but they cannot vote for a Member \nof Congress, they do not have their own Senators. We should have \nstatehood. If you are part of a sovereign nation--for example, the \nPyramid Lake Piute Tribe in Nevada, they can vote for me, against me, \nbut the District of Columbia does not have that opportunity. Residents \nof the District of Columbia pay taxes, they serve our country, but they \ndo not have representation in Congress by a Member who has a right to \nvote on a substantive issue. They have a Member of Congress who only \ncan sit in committees. If this administration feels so strongly about \naffirmative action, about fairness, diversity, let them come forward \nand support DC statehood.\n  And consider the quality of education that children receive. Most \nminority students in America still attend schools that are \npredominantly minority. On average, they are in large classes, have \nolder books, receive less challenging lessons, and their teachers\n\n[[Page S1171]]\n\nhave less training. To continue to improve the quality of education for \nall Americans, we should raise the standards in our schools. We need \nthe administration to step forward on Leave No Child Behind, and do it \nby helping to fund the program mandated for schools all over America. \nNot to take care of unfunded mandates is wrong; the administration \nshould fund those mandates.\n  Our Nation's efforts to recover from September 11 remind us that we \nbecome a stronger America by working together. So we must join together \nand continue fighting to make sure all Americans enjoy equal \nopportunities for justice, quality education, and economic prosperity.\n  In 2003, it is not enough to quote Dr. Martin Luther King, or to say \nthe right thing, or avoid saying the wrong thing. Actions speak louder \nthan words, even words as powerful as Dr. King's. We remember him as an \narticulate speaker. It was his actions, his nonviolent actions of \norganizing, educating, motivating, and demonstrating, that achieved \nresults. If we are truly to honor Dr. King, and, more importantly, if \nwe are fully motivated to improve race relations in our great country, \nif we want America to live up to its democratic ideals and all our \npeople to have equal opportunity, freedom, justice, prosperity, and \npeace, we must pass civil rights legislation and fund programs that \nhelp level the playing field and appoint judges whose records show a \ncommitment to tolerance and fairness.\n  The record of the Democratic Party is one we can be proud of. It \nshows a longstanding commitment to civil rights, to fairness. Democrats \nrecognize we must take additional steps to advance civil rights for all \nAmericans. That is why we Democrats in the Senate have a package of \ncivil rights, known as Equal Rights and Equal Dignity for Americans. \nOur comprehensive legislation includes measures to expand hate crimes \nprotections. Let the Republicans come forward and stop barring us from \npassing that. We have legislation to strengthen enforcement of existing \ncivil rights laws. Let them move across the aisle and help.\n  We must support legislation giving legal representation to indigent \nAmericans. We must stop racial profiling. That is what our legislation \ndoes. It addresses pay inequities between men and women, protecting \nindividuals against discrimination; it prohibits employment \ndiscrimination based on sexual orientation; and our legislation \nprohibits military and civilian personnel from collecting information \nabout U.S. citizens. We must fully fund election reforms that we passed \nlast year. This is an agenda that is important, it is good, and it \nshould pass.\n  We ask the Republicans to step forward and help repudiate, condemn, \nand oppose something as racially motivated, obviously, as that reported \nin Time magazine, the President's reinstatement of something that his \nfather stopped because it was wrong--laying a wreath at the Confederate \nMemorial. It is wrong. We need to speak out against it because it is \nwrong.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senator Edwards is here and has an amendment \nto offer. We told the majority leader on Friday we would be here at \n10:30 to offer the amendment. Senator Edwards will not offer the \namendment until we have someone who is here from the other side, but he \nis going to start talking about his amendment. We hope that is OK with \neveryone.\n  What is the business now before the Senate?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/21/senate-section/article/S1171-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1171]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of H.J. Res. 2, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (H.J. Res. 2) making further continuing \n     appropriations for the fiscal year 2003, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 67\n\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, this morning I will be offering an \namendment, together with Senator Lieberman, Senator Jeffords, Senator \nClinton, and Senator Reid, all of whom have worked very hard on this \namendment.\n  This amendment is about doing a very simple thing: it is about \nkeeping our air clean so that kids won't have asthma attacks and so \nseniors won't have heart attacks and so Americans won't lose their \nlives before their time. For months the administration has talked about \nmassive changes in clean air protections and for months Senators on \nboth sides of the aisle have said to the administration: Before you go \nthrough with these changes, would you please tell us in detail how \nthese changes are going to affect our families? In other words, would \nyou please look before you leap?\n  We have been asking that question for months, and for months the \nadministration has refused to answer. On November 22, they went ahead \nwith their massive changes without telling us how it was going to \naffect the health of the American people.\n  I believe the administration does not want to share these facts \nbecause they are afraid of what the facts will show. They are afraid \npeople will see what their rule changes will do. When you study these \nrules, when you listen to the experts, you will see that they will make \nour air dirtier. These rules will add more soot to our cities and more \nsmog to our national parks. At the end of the day, these rules will \nallow more kids to get asthma attacks, more seniors to have heart \nproblems which land them in the emergency room, and more people will \nlose their lives prematurely.\n  This amendment is a very modest response to these proposed changes. \nIt does not block the rules forever. It does not put them off for \nyears. It just says let's put these rules off for about 6 months and \nuse that time to determine how these changes will affect human health, \nhow they will affect kids with asthma, senior citizens with \ncardiorespiratory problems. It seems to be a perfectly reasonable thing \nto do. I hope my colleagues will support the amendment.\n  We are saying let's get a study from the nonpartisan, completely \nrespected National Academy of Sciences. That is all we are talking \nabout: 6-month delay to look at these changes to see, before they go \ninto effect, what effect they will have on the health of the American \npeople.\n  The science of pollution is completely clear. Pollution causes heart \nand lung problems. It aggravates asthma. It causes the smog that ruins \nthe view in our Nation's parks. It causes premature deaths.\n  According to Abt Associates, a nonpartisan research group, just 51 \npowerplants are responsible for more than 5,500 deaths every year, for \nover 106,000 asthma attacks, and for costs to our economy of between \n$31 billion and $49 billion. That is only 51 powerplants. If you did \nthe same study of other industries, the numbers would go up \ndramatically.\n  North Carolina has some of the worst pollution in the country. \nAccording to Dr. Clay Ballantine, a physician in Asheville in western \nNorth Carolina, just living and breathing in western North Carolina \ncosts 1 to 3 years off the average life of a person. The UNC School of \nPublic Health, found that in many of our counties 3 in 10 kids have \nasthma, which is three times the national average.\n  Just walking in the Great Smoky Mountains is as bad for your lungs as \nbreathing in many big cities. When the head of the EPA, Christie Todd \nWhitman, visited the Great Smokies last Fourth of July, she could \nbarely see 15 miles at a place where you used to be able to see 75 to \n100 miles. So clean air is a huge priority. It is important for our \nkids, for seniors, and for our parks.\n  This administration has made radical changes in the regulations under \nthe\n\n[[Page S1172]]\n\nClean Air Act. This is about a program called New Source Review or NSR. \nThe basic idea of NSR is simple. Under the Clean Air Act, if someone \nbuilds a new factory, the new factory has to have state-of-the-art \nequipment to prevent pollution, but there is a special deal for \nfactories that were built before 1977. Those factories don't need to \ninstall new pollution controls unless and until their toxic emissions \ngo up by a significant amount. Only when that happens does the plant \nhave to install these new controls that others have to meet instantly. \nThis is what the New Source Review is all about.\n  There is no question--and all of us believe--that reforming NSR is a \ngood idea. We ought to do two things: One, we ought to cut red tape, \nwhich is a problem; two, we ought to cut pollution.\n  Under Carol Browner, EPA Administrator in the Clinton administration, \npositive work was done in that direction. But the debate today is not \nabout those kinds of reasonable and sensible reforms that are in the \nbest interest of the American people. This debate is about this \nadministration's package.\n  There are several glaring problems with that package. First, the \nadministration developed these rules through a series of secret \nconsultations with executives from power and oil companies. It would \nnot have been so bad if the administration had also been talking \nsecretly to regular patients and kids and doctors about what effect \nthese changes in the rules would have on their lives and their health. \nBut there is no evidence they did that. Instead, the administration \nfocused on one side and favored that side in the changes they made in \nthe rules.\n\n  The second problem is this administration has never explained in any \nserious way whether these changes will in fact harm human health, \nwhether they will cause more pollution, more asthma, or more premature \ndeaths. For months we have asked for a serious qualitative study, and \nfor months we have not received that study.\n  Let me go through a short timetable. On July 16, 2002, at a joint \nhearing of the Environmental Committee and the Judiciary Committee, \nboth Senator Jeffords and I asked Jeff Holmstead, the EPA's top clean \nair official, whether he could quantify the effects of this proposal on \na human level. He could not do it then, and the best I can tell, he has \nnot tried to do it since.\n  On August 1, 2002, 44 Senators signed a bipartisan letter to EPA \nwhich asks the EPA to conduct a rigorous analysis of the air pollution \nand public health impact of the proposed rule changes. Again, they \ndidn't do it.\n  On September 3, 2002, I again asked Mr. Holmstead for an analysis of \nEPA's proposals. Mr. Holmstead had no new analysis. Instead, he pointed \nback to an analysis that had been done 6 years earlier during the \nClinton administration--a different set of proposals, a different \nanalysis.\n  The head of the EPA, 6 years ago, Carol Browner, who testified at the \nhearing, said the old study proved nothing. But when I asked Mr. \nHolmstead if EPA would simply hold off on the new rules until we had a \nreal study on the effect that these new rules would have on the health \nof the American people, he said no.\n  On November 22, 2002, the administration just went ahead, finalized \nthe rules without giving any credible evidence on what impact this \nwould have on human health.\n  So what we are saying is not complicated. We are saying: Should we \nnot look before we leap, before we change rules that can affect the \nmost basic protection for our kids and our families and our parks? \nShould we not at least do an analysis of what impact it is going to \nhave on kids and families and our environment and our parks?\n  The administration's answer is no. Let's go ahead. I believe that is \ntheir answer because they don't want to know the truth because they are \nafraid of what the truth will be.\n  If you look at these rules, which I have and others have, it is clear \nthat they will hurt people. Time after time this administration has \ntwisted proposals made under the Clinton administration to allow more \npollution.\n  Here is what Ms. Browner said:\n\n       The current administration's recent announcement of final \n     changes to the New Source Review Program abandons the promise \n     of the Clean Air Act--steady air quality improvements. [These \n     rules] will allow the air to become dirtier.\n\n  Let me repeat that: These rules ``will allow the air to become \ndirtier.'' And that means they will allow our kids and our seniors to \nget sicker, to die sooner. That is what we are talking about. It is \nvery basic and fundamental.\n  Let me give two examples of what these rules will do:\n  First, the rules change the way pollution levels are calculated. \nUnder the new source review, a factory has to clean up only if it \nincreases its pollution level. It matters a lot how we measure the \nfactory's initial pollution level, what's called the ``baseline.''\n  Up to now, the rule has been that the baseline is the average for the \nlast 2 years--that is the basis on which we determine whether there has \nbeen an increase in pollution--unless the company can prove another \nperiod is more representative of recent emissions. But the basic rule \nhas been that you establish the baseline by looking at the last 2 \nyears. That makes sense.\n  What this administration proposes doing makes no sense. What they are \nsaying is instead of using the last 2 years, we let the factory choose \nany 2 years out of the last 10. So instead of looking at the last 2 \nyears as a baseline to determine whether emissions have gone up, what \nthey are saying is we are going to let the factory choose any 2 years \nin the previous 10 in order to determine whether emissions have gone \nup.\n  So even if the reality is that their pollution level is quite low \nright now, they get to go back a decade and say that pollution is high.\n  They can even take emissions from accidents and malfunctions and use \nthose to inflate their baseline. And because they can make pollution 10 \nyears ago look like pollution today, they can pollute even more without \ncleaning up.\n  You don't have to take my word for it. According to internal \ndocuments, career staff at the EPA said that this change would \n``significantly diminish the scope'' of the New Source Review. A study \nby the Environmental Integrity Project found that at just two \nfacilities, the new rules would allow over 120 tons of the pollution \ninto the air. The National Association of State and Local Air \nRegulators says that this change ``provides yet another opportunity for \nnew emissions to avoid NSR.'' So the bottom line is more pollution.\n  Here is a second example. The new rules contain something called a \n``Clean Unit'' exemption. In theory, the exemption should give \ncompanies an incentive to clean up by giving them benefits if they \ninstall state-of-the-art technology. It is a perfectly good idea. But \nthis administration has provided an exemption as long as the company \ninstalled new equipment anytime during the last 10 years. In other \nwords, if a company did something good in 1994, they get a free pass to \nincrease pollution in 2003, 9 years later.\n  Again, this makes no sense. Again, it will increase pollution. Again, \nhere is what the State and local air commissioners said. This rule \n``would substantially weaken the environmental protections offered by \nthe NSR program.''\n  Now, when it comes to the effects of these rules, it is true that the \nState administrators could be wrong. The career officials at EPA could \nbe wrong. I could be wrong. We could all be wrong. The rules could be \nOK.\n  But even if we are all wrong--and I do not believe we are--shouldn't \nwe get the whole story and get a real answer to the question before \nputting our kids and our seniors at risk?\n  Six months is not a long time to wait in order to get the whole \nstory. It is far better to wait 6 months than to say to this \nadministration, go ahead, roll the dice. It is OK. We are willing to \nput the lives of our children and seniors at risk, and we are willing \nto let this rule go into effect even though we do not know what effect \nit is going to have on the health of our seniors and children.\n  Let me talk for a minute about the broad opposition to these rules.\n  This administration likes to talk about State flexibility, but these \nregulations take flexibility away from the States and forces some \nStates to lower their protections.\n  Again, this is the view of the State experts:\n\n       The revised requirements go beyond even what industry \n     requested. . . . Because the reforms are mandatory, they will \n     impede, or\n\n[[Page S1173]]\n\n     even preclude, the ability of States and localities all \n     across the country to protect the air.\n       Although our associations believe NSR can be improved. . . \n     . We firmly believe the controversial reforms EPA is putting \n     in place . . . will result in unchecked emission increases \n     that will degrade our air quality and endanger public health.\n\n  That is the States. Now listen to the doctors. Over a thousand \ndoctors from all across the country have urged this administration not \nto go ahead with these final rules. These doctors see the effects of \nair pollution every day in their practices and in the emergency rooms, \nand they warned that ``it is irresponsible for the EPA to move forward \nin finalizing new regulations that could have a negative impact on \nhuman health.''\n  This is not a partisan issue. The State air quality folks are not \npartisans. The local air quality folks are not partisans. And then \nthere's Republicans for Environmental Protection, a group to which 12 \npast or present former Republican Members of Congress are connected. \nRepublicans for Environmental Protection recently wrote a letter \nsupporting my amendment.\n  They wrote that ``a reasonable delay (of the rules) is necessary in \norder to allow independent researchers to investigate how the New \nSource Review revisions would affect emissions and the resulting \nimpacts on public health.'' So Republicans support this amendment as \nwell.\n  We will hear people say that protecting the air is too expensive. But \nat the 51 power plants I mentioned earlier, premature deaths and asthma \nattacks cost our country over $30 billion each year. The costs of \ncleaning the air are a small fraction of that amount. So clean air not \nonly saves lives; it also saves money.\n  Finally, I want to be very clear about what this amendment does and \ndoes not do. This amendment delays by 6 months the effective date for \nthe final rules on the New Source Review that this administration has \nalready announced. This amendment does not touch the proposed rules \nregarding so-called ``routine maintenance.''\n  Now, speaking for myself, Senator Lieberman and Senator Jeffords, all \nof whom have worked very hard on this amendment, we understand the \nimportance of new rulemaking on the definition of ``routine \nmaintenance.'' We understand that reform of this definition is underway \nto allow for greater certainty for the electric industry. It is a good \nidea. We are not doing anything in this amendment that affects in any \nway the proposed rulemaking on ``routine maintenance.'' In fact, we \nbelieve it is appropriate to take public comment in the rulemaking in \norder to develop a rule that promotes energy efficiency, without--and I \nemphasize ``without''--allowing the air to become dirtier. A bipartisan \ngroup in this chamber has expressed support for EPA proceeding with a \nrulemaking that ``protects human health and the environment while \nproviding regulatory certainty for the electric utility industry and \nother industries.'' We respect their concerns on this issue.\n  This amendment is about final rules. It is a very modest amendment. \nIt would delay these rules by about 6 months while we get an honest, \nnonpartisan study of what these rules will do to our kids' health and \nthe environment. It will protect our kids from asthma, our seniors from \nheart problems, our parks from smog. This amendment will make sure we \nlook before we leap. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nsupport this amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following documents be printed in \nthe Record following this statement:\n  Letter from 44 Senators, dated August 1, requesting an analysis of \nthe new rules;\n  Letter from Physicians for Social Responsibility, dated September 27, \nopposing the rule changes;\n  Letter from the State and Territorial Air Pollution Program \nAdministrators and the Association of Local Air Pollution Control \nOfficers, dated January 16 of this year, requesting a delay in the rule \nchanges; and\n  Letter from the Republicans for Environmental Protection, dated \nJanuary 17, 2003, requesting a delay in the rule changes.\n  There being no objection, the following letters were ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Christine Whitman,\n     Administrator, Environmental Protection Agency, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Administrator Whitman: The Clean Air Act is a vital \n     took for protecting the Nation's health and environment, \n     including our National Parks. With mounting medical evidence \n     that air pollution causes asthma attacks, cardiopulmonary \n     disease, and premature death--particularly among children and \n     the elderly--we need to strengthen clean air protections \n     whenever possible.\n       Given our strong commitment to protecting Americans' \n     health, we believe that the changes you announced on June 13, \n     2002 to the Clean Air Act's ``New Source Review'' are \n     extremely troubling. On their face, many of these changes to \n     NSR--for example, giving factories greater leeway to choose \n     how their pollution is measured--appear likely to increase \n     pollution levels. Unsurprisingly, the states' air pollution \n     control administrators have expressed concerns that the new \n     regulations will make it more difficult for the states to \n     attain national clean air standards. Yet as Assistant \n     Administrator Jeffrey Holmstead admitted at a recent hearing, \n     EPA now plans to make these changes without having conducted \n     a full analysis of their impact on air quality and public \n     health, and without providing a full opportunity for public \n     notice and comment on the changes EPA is now proposing.\n       While EPA should be free to pursue thoughtful changes to \n     New Source Review that reduce regulatory burdens while \n     strengthening public health protection, we see no reason to \n     believe that the proposed changes adequately protect air \n     quality. In fact, because the specific changes proposed have \n     not been subject to careful study and full public comment, we \n     have serious concerns that the changes could allow more air \n     pollution--causing more asthma, more heart and lung problems, \n     and more premature deaths.\n       We therefore ask that, before finalizing any of these \n     changes, EPA conduct a rigorous analysis of the air pollution \n     and public health impacts of the proposed rule changes and \n     give the public full opportunity to comment on these changes. \n     As we are sure you agree, EPA should not finalize a rule that \n     allows increased air pollution or undercuts the health of any \n     of America's children or seniors. In the meantime, until the \n     law is changed, we ask your continued commitment to enforce \n     the Clean Air Act as it is written.\n           Sincerely,\n         John Edwards, Jim Jeffords, Joseph Lieberman, Tom \n           Daschle, Susan Collins, Dick Durbin, Chris Dodd, \n           Charles Schumer, Daniel K.

We are \n     therefore writing to express our concern about EPA's proposed \n     changes to the New Source Review (NSR) program. This program \n     regulates emissions from new and modified power plants, pulp \n     and paper mills, refineries and other industrial plants.\n       For more than a decade, NSR has proved to be an effective \n     took in bringing polluting industrial facilities into \n     compliance with the law and cleaning up the air that we \n     breathe. The EPA has recently proposed changes to the NSR \n     program that will likely cause the amount of pollution in our \n     air to increase. EPA plans to move forward with these changes \n     to NSR without first determining how they will impact health \n     or the environment. Three separate Senate Committees as well \n     as public health and environmental advocacy groups have \n     requested these studies to no avail. Without evidence that \n     the proposed changes will actually improve air quality, \n     thereby doing no harm, it is irresponsible for the EPA to \n     move forward in finalizing new regulations that could have a \n     negative impact on human health.\n       Pollution from power plants and other plants regulated \n     under NSR touches the lives of millions of Americans across \n     the nation. This pollution is harmful to human health and \n     sends thousands of individuals to hospital emergency rooms \n     each month. Study after study shows a link between exposure \n     to air pollution and health conditions such as respiratory \n     diseases, asthma attacks, cardiopulmonary disease, cancer, \n     and even death.\n\n[[Page S1174]]\n\n       No changes to NSR should occur without the public being \n     provided with a comprehensive analysis demonstrating that the \n     proposed changes to NSR will improve air quality and human \n     health. In addition the public, especially the public health \n     community, must have the opportunity to comment on the \n     analysis and the resulting changes to NSR before any changes \n     are finalized. We urge you to put the health of Americans \n     first by upholding NSR provisions that are protective of \n     public health.\n           Sincerely,\n       Hans Tschersich, Kodiak, AK.\n       Helena Zimmerman, Juneau, AK.\n       Claude Baldwin, Jr., Hunstville, AL.\n       Anna-Laura Cook, Northport, AL.\n       David Reynolds, Birmingham, AL.\n       Bettina Bickel, Glendale, AZ.\n       Kenley Donaldson, Casa Grande, AZ.\n       Sara Gibson, Flagstaff, AZ.\n       William Martin, Tucson, AZ.\n       Ardyth Norem, Rio Verde, AZ.\n       Eric Ossowski, Scottsdale, AZ.\n       Jen Schaffer, Flagstaff, AZ.\n       Kamal Abu-Shamsieh, Pasadena, CA.\n       Sara Acree, Alhambra, CA.\n       David Adelson, Venice, CA.\n       Jacob Adelstone, Van Nuys, CA.\n       Felix Aguilar, Long Beach, CA.\n       Fereshteh Ajdari, Culver City, CA.\n       Wayne and Sonia Aller, Granada Hills, CA.\n       Rodolfo Alvarez, Santa Monica, CA.\n       Frances Amella, San Francisco, CA.\n       Selene Anema, San Luis Obispo, CA.\n       Ruben Aronin, Los Angeles, CA.\n       Misha Askren, Los Angeles, CA.\n       Annie Azzariti, Santa Monica, CA.\n       K.

Christine Todd Whitman,\n     Administrator, Environmental Protection Agency, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Governor Whitman: As you are aware, the State and \n     Territorial Air Pollution Program Administrators (STAPPA) and \n     the Association of Local Air Pollution Control Officials \n     (ALAPCO) have serious concerns with the U.S. Environmental \n     Protection Agency's (EPA's) recently promulgated final rule \n     affecting changes to the New Source Review (NSR) program (67 \n     Federal Register 80186), and with the adverse impact these \n     changes would likely have on the ability of states and \n     localities to achieve and sustain clean, healthful air. These \n     concerns are further compounded by the fact that, for a \n     number of states across the country, the revised NSR program \n     is scheduled to take effect on March 3, 2003. Accordingly, we \n     write to you today, on behalf of STAPPA and ALAPCO, to \n     request that EPA extend by one year the effective date of the \n     final NSR rule revisions. We make this urgent request for \n     several important reasons.\n       The regulatory changes to the NSR program are not only \n     lengthy and far reaching, but also highly complex and \n     controversial. States that implement the NSR program through \n     their State Implementation Plan are allowed three years in \n     which to revise their plans for the new program. However, in \n     13 states across the nation, EPA has delegated authority for \n     the federal rules to state and local permitting authorities; \n     in these ``delegated'' states, the revised NSR program, which \n     was published by EPA on December 31, 2002, must be \n     implemented by March 3, 2003. State and local air pollution \n     control agencies have been working vigorously to study the \n     new rule; however, gaining full command of the many \n     intricacies of the regulation, as well as a complete \n     understanding of the impacts and implications, will take time \n     and, we firmly believe, cannot be accomplished in the next 45 \n     days.\n       Further, although the text of the rule revisions has been \n     published in the Federal Register, EPA has not yet developed \n     or made available to state and local agencies the complex \n     text of the federal rule, as revised by the recent changes. \n     Moreover, EPA has not yet provided, or even scheduled, \n     training opportunities for states and localities, nor has the \n     agency developed any guidance on key aspects of the revised \n     rule. In fact, it is our understanding that EPA regional \n     office staff--with whom states and localities must work to \n     revise and update delegation agreements--has not yet received \n     training on the new rules from EPA headquarters.\n       STAPPA and ALAPCO understand that EPA would like to make \n     the final rule available to industry as soon as possible. We \n     are deeply concerned, however, that a rush to implement the \n     new rule will result in serious consequences that will \n     disbenefit state and local implementing agencies, EPA, the \n     regulated community and citizens alike.\n       The March 3, 2003 effective date simply does not allow \n     sufficient time for delegated state and local agencies to \n     prepare for and execute effective implementation of the new \n     NSR rule. Accordingly, STAPPA and ALAPCO urge that you take \n     immediate action to extend the effective date of this new \n     program by one year, in order to allow time for EPA \n     development of guidance and training and for the necessary \n     state and local efforts involved in updating delegation. If \n     you have any questions, please contact either of us or Bill \n     Becker, Executive Director of STAPPA and ALAPCO, at (202) \n     624-7864.\n           Sincerely,\n     Lloyd L. Eagan,\n       STAPPA President.\n     Ellen Garvey,\n       ALAPCO President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 January 17, 2003.\n       Dear Senator: REP America, the national grassroots \n     organization of Republicans for environmental protection, \n     respectfully requests your vote in favor of Senator Edwards' \n     amendment to the omnibus appropriations bill, which would \n     delay implementation of New Source Review rule revisions and \n     require the administration to conduct a National Academy of \n     Sciences study of the rule revisions' health impacts.\n       We believe a reasonable delay is necessary in order to \n     allow independent researchers to investigate how the New \n     Source Review revisions would affect emissions and the \n     resulting impacts on public health. We are greatly concerned \n     that the administration is rushing to change the rules before \n     the public and their elected representatives have had a \n     chance to fully understand the impacts.\n       More than 170 million Americans live in areas with \n     unhealthy air quality. Ozone pollution is a serious public \n     health problem. The interests of children, senior citizens, \n     and others who are particularly sensitive to air pollution \n     deserve greater consideration before rule changes are \n     implemented that could drive up unhealthy emissions.\n       Please vote for the Edwards amendment so that the federal \n     government can make better informed decisions on a critical \n     public health issue.\n       Thank you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Martha A. Marks,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Edwards], for himself, \n     Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Jeffords, Mrs. Clinton, and Mr. Reid, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 67.\n\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To require a study of the final rule relating to prevention \n  of significant deterioration and nonattainment new source review to \n  determine the effects of the final rule on air pollution and human \n                                health)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . NEW SOURCE REVIEW FINAL RULE.\n\n       (a) Cooperative Agreement.--As soon as practicable after \n     the date of enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the \n     Environmental Protection Agency shall enter into a \n     cooperative agreement with the National Academy of Sciences \n     to determine, not later than September 1, 2003, whether and \n     to what extent the final rule relating to prevention of \n     significant deterioration and nonattainment new source \n     review, published at 67 Fed. Reg. 80186 (December 31, 2002), \n     would allow or could result in--\n       (1) any increase in air pollution (in the aggregate or at \n     any specific site); or\n       (2) any adverse effect on human health.\n       (b) Delayed Effective Date.--The final rule described in \n     subsection (a) shall not take effect before September 15, \n     2003.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to ask my colleagues to \nrestore a little sanity to our Nation's clean air policy. For the past \n2 years, I have joined my colleagues on the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee in requesting an analysis of the health impacts of the \nadministration's New Source Review rules. We have asked through \nletters, through committee questions, through oral questions at \nhearings. Yet our requests fell on deaf ears, or shall I say on dead \nair, and the EPA finalized the rules without conducting any careful \nanalysis.\n  That is why today I join Senator Edwards in offering this amendment--\none that I call the ``look before you leap'' amendment. All we do in \nthis amendment is delay the effective date of the final rules for less \nthan 7 months, during which time we commission a NAS study to evaluate \nthe effects of the rules on air emissions and human health. In just 7 \nmonths, depending on the outcome of those objective, scientific \nstudies, we could prevent serious potential damage to our environment \nand to public health.\n  What the Bush administration is proposing is not, as some in the \nadministration might suggest, a nip-and-tuck. It's not a few technical \nrule changes. It is a significant change in our clean air policy. The \nadministration is introducing new, more permissive rules for measuring \nwhether a facility meets clean air requirements. In Congressional \ntestimony, the EPA admitted that fully 50 percent of the facilities \nthat are now subject to the Clean Air Act's technology requirements \nwould fall out of those requirements under the rule changes.\n\n[[Page S1175]]\n\n  When I hear that, I cannot believe there will be no health impacts. \nIf literally half the sources are no longer subject to these provisions \nof the government's main clean air law, how can the air get anything \nbut dirtier? Then I look at recent studies commissioned by the \nRockefeller Family Fund and prepared by Abt Associates--the EPA's own \nconsultant--that show emissions will increase as a result of the new \nregulations.\n  Based on the bulk of the evidence, it is counterintuitive and I think \nillogical for the EPA to claim--over and over again--that their new \nrules will do no damage to the environment. Then again, the EPA never \noffers any proof of this claim, so perhaps we are expected to accept in \non faith.\n  This amendment will give us the answer. We no longer will have to \nargue back and forth--the study being commissioned by the National \nAcademies will give us the facts. And we don't have to wait long. Less \nthan 7 months, and then we can go forward with the rules knowing what \ntheir impacts will be. If the study shows significant environmental \nharm, and the majority of this body still wants them to be adopted, \nthen so be it. But at least we made an informed choice.\n  Anyone in this Senate who has bought a house has toured the house \nbefore putting their money down. They've gotten an appraisal. They've \nconducted an inspection. Well, we're on the brink of buying a new set \nof rules here that we will have to live with for many, many years. I \ndon't think we want to close our eyes, close our ears, cross our \nfingers and hope for the best. Ignorance is not bliss. Ignorance is \nremiss.\n  This amendment also brings a benefit for the states. Just last week, \nSTAPPA-ALAPCO--the organization of state and local air regulators--\nwrote to Administrator Whitman asking for a 1-year delay in the rules. \nThey had already written to complain about the air impacts of the \nrules, but this letter was different--it aimed at the administrative \nknots in which the states are being placed by the new regulations.\n  You see, these rules are not optional for States--they are being \nshoved down their throats. And for the 12 States and the District of \nColumbia that implement the New Source Review program on their own, \nthey will have to incorporate the rule changes into their programs by \nMarch 3. So my colleagues are clear, let me name them: Washington, \nCalifornia, Nevada, South Dakota, Minnesota, Illinois, Indiana, \nMichigan, New York, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and the \nDistrict of Columbia. As the rules were only published on December 31, \nthat only gives these states and the district 3 months to evaluate and \nimplement a tremendously complicated area of law. Neither has EPA \nprovided the training and guidance that all States will need to \nimplement the rule. That is why the States wrote to EPA last week and \nstated that: ``The March 3 effective date simply does not allow \nsufficient time for delegated state and local agencies to prepare for \nand executive effective implementation of the new NSR rule.''\n  By passing our amendment, we will be giving the state and local \nagencies the time that they desperately need. Call it breathing room--\nfor our environment and for our State governments.\n  This is a controversial topic, and I know my colleagues have been \npulled in many different directions on this vote. But we are not asking \nfor anything here but smart, well-informed policymaking. Once a rule \nlike this is put in place, it is hard to reverse; indeed, according to \nEPA, the whole point of this rule is to provide industry with long-term \ncertainty. We asked EPA to look before they leapt, and they refused, \nignoring this institution's right to oversee their rulemaking at the \nsame time.\n  We should understand the clean air impacts of these rule changes \nbefore they become the law of the land. We need to stop and take a \nbreath before we change the law, so that we know that all Americans can \nbreathe safely, easily, and freely in the future.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Edwards \namendment and I am pleased to be a cosponsor of that amendment.\n  Senators should know that I support making improvements to the New \nSource Review, NSR, program. I want NSR to fulfill its promise of \ndeveloping ever better pollution control technology and cleaner air.\n  We can and should make it easier for owners of pollution sources to \nget answers from permitting authorities about whether or not NSR \napplies to their facility. They could benefit from an updated, more \nconsistent and timely process. That's not really in question.\n  Unfortunately, every reliable sign indicates that EPA's recent final \nrules are not really improvements to the NSR process at all. Instead, \nin the name of ``flexibility'' these new rules appear designed to \nincrease air pollution. At a minimum, they will certainly allow it.\n  EPA claims that there will be an environmental benefit from these \nrules. However, they have done no credible work to show that that is in \nfact true. And believe me, we have asked repeatedly and unsuccessfully \nfor the administration's honest assessment of the impact of these rules \nsince May 2001.\n  For example, the agency promised to deliver to the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee a document log relating to these rules by \nOctober 24, 2002.\n  We hoped to find emissions information in those files, but the agency \nfailed to keep the promise and failed to provide Congress its due. \nWe're still waiting for the log.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a chart of the Committee's \ncommunications on NSR be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. This administration's record in responding to \nlegitimate oversight by Congress has been dismal on this matter. Though \nthe agency will not respond honestly, independent analyses done by Abt \nAssociates for the Environmental Integrity Project demonstrates that \nthese new rules are likely to lead to significant increases in \npollution at various types of facilities. These case studies can be \nfound at www.refund.org/eit/docs/abill-mobil.pdf and abtin-nucor2.pdf.\n  The association of States' air administrators have expressed concerns \nabout these rules and asked that their effective date be deferred until \nMarch 2004. Nine Attorneys General, from Vermont and other States, have \nfiled suit against the Agency for violating the Clean Air Act and other \nstatutes through these rules.\n  These rules allow sources to inflate their emissions baselines, or to \nbe designated as so-called ``clean units'' for a decade or more. That \nway, even modifications that increase emissions will not trigger NSR \nand the use of better, more effective pollution controls.\n  As Assistant Administrator Jeff Holmstead has confirmed to Congress \nin testimony, these new revisions to major NSR applicability criteria \nwould exclude an estimated 50 percent of sources that might otherwise \nbe subject to major NSR.\n  An internal EPA memo from June 2001 estimated that the average annual \nhealth benefits in terms of avoided mortality from just one small part \nof the NSR program are, at a minimum, about $400 million annually and \nup to $3.8 billion.\n  Now, if we tell 50 percent of those sources that they don't have to \nworry about triggering NSR, then those health benefits are going to fly \nout the window along with more pollution. That means more people dying \nor increased lung disease and sickness.\n  This is just one small part of the NSR program. EPA steadfastly \nrefuses to analyze the larger, nonattainment NSR program for its \nbenefits.\n  The administration has conveniently ignored Executive Order 12866 on \nregulatory review. These revisions are obviously significant under that \nOrder because of its hundreds of millions or billions of dollars in \nannual health benefits. So, before it goes forward, there must be a \nthorough and reliable consideration of its benefits and its costs.\n  That's why I'm supporting this amendment. I'm not a big fan of making \nenvironmental policy through the appropriations process, but these \nrules appear egregious to me.\n  It's time that we had the National Academy of Sciences review the \nsituation, since the agency and the administration do not respond to \nCongress or the public. I hope that the Academy can give us a quick and \nimpartial opinion on the impacts of these rules on\n\n[[Page S1176]]\n\npublic health and the environment. To give them time to do that, the \namendment defers the effective date of the rules for about six months.\n  Mr. President, this administration has a disturbing anti-environment \nagenda. These NSR changes are just the tip of the iceberg. This group \nwants to deregulate without considering the public health and \nenvironmental effects. That's wrong.\n  There is no good reason to increase air pollution. Science tells us \nthat time and time again. We have the technology to constantly improve \nour emission performance. This administration wants to take the whole \ncountry backward instead of forward.\n  I urge Senators to support the amendment.\n\n[[Page S1177]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T21JA03.001\n\n\n\n[[Page S1178]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T21JA03.002\n\n\n\n[[Page S1179]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T21JA03.003\n\n\n\n[[Page S1180]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T21JA03.004\n\n\n\n[[Page S1181]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T21JA03.005\n\n\n\n[[Page S1182]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T21JA03.006\n\n\n\n[[Page S1183]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T21JA03.007\n\n\n\n[[Page S1184]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T21JA03.008\n\n\n\n[[Page S1185]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T21JA03.009\n\n\n\n[[Page S1186]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T21JA03.010\n\n\n\n[[Page S1187]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T21JA03.011\n\n\n\n[[Page S1188]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T21JA03.012\n\n\n\n[[Page S1189]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T21JA03.013\n\n\n\n[[Page S1190]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T21JA03.014\n\n\n\n[[Page S1191]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T21JA03.015\n\n\n\n[[Page S1192]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T21JA03.016\n\n\n\n[[Page S1193]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T21JA03.017\n\n\n\n[[Page S1194]]\n\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, we have before us, although not under lively \ndebate, an amendment by the Senator from North Carolina with reference \nto the New Source Review air program. This is a very important program \nthat we have debated extensively in the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee. There have been many hearings on this issue and, frankly, \nthe issue has been resolved. But unfortunately, it has become an \nexample of the polarized, confrontational, contentious nature of the \nenvironmental debate. I wish it were not this way.\n  I believe the administration's New Source Review reforms are good for \nthe environment, good for energy security, and good for the economy.\n  I will not go into all the details here because I know there are many \nother Senators wishing to speak. So I will await further discussions \nwhen they have had their say.\n  I think it is important--I want to lay down a marker--for my \ncolleagues to understand that the EPA's New Source Review reforms--what \nwe call the NSR reforms--will improve air quality and benefit the \nenvironment. EPA has already done the environmental analysis. It shows \nthat four of the five provisions in the final rule will reduce air \npollution. That is correct. I said ``will reduce air pollution.'' The \nother provision will have no significant effect on air quality.\n  NSR will no longer stand as a barrier to facilities installing state-\nof-the-art pollution control technology. Anybody who has been around \nWashington very long knows the law of unintended consequences. We do \nthings we think are going to help, and they turn out to be a hindrance.\n  The New Source Review, as it has worked, has been a hindrance because \ncompanies cannot make routine improvements and upgrades to their \nfacilities to make them operate more efficiently, take less energy, \nburn less fuel, emit less pollution or polluting substances, anywhere \nfrom volatile organic compounds to the other emissions from \npowerplants. They do that because the New Source Review says that \nanytime you want to do anything significant on a major plant, you have \nto go through the whole process. It takes a very long time, and you are \nrequired to make very significant upgrades beyond what the available \ndollars in the company would sustain.\n  The incremental continuing improvements, day by day or actually month \nby month or even year by year, cannot be made because of NSR. If you \nchange it the way the EPA Administrator has proposed, NSR will no \nlonger stand as a barrier to facilities installing state-of-the-art \npollution control technology.\n  The NSR reforms that EPA has proposed will actually cut emissions of \ntens of thousands of tons per year of volatile organic compounds. NSR \nreforms will reduce ground level ozone and smog. The NSR reforms will \nalso cut hazardous air pollutants and ozone-depleting substances. Our \nfamilies will suffer fewer cases of premature mortality, asthma, and \nother respiratory diseases.\n  I would say further that EPA's NSR reforms are good for the Nation's \nenergy security. Why? Simply because they will allow facilities to \ninstall modern technologies which use energy more efficiently. We all \nought to be able to agree on that. Using energy efficiently conserves \nenergy and reduces the polluting byproducts of energy production. The \nfacilities will be able to reduce their energy consumption, reduce \ntheir dependence on foreign energy sources, and reduce our Nation's \ndependence on foreign energy supplies.\n  What is wrong with that? In our current troubled times, we should not \nstand in the way of any proposal which reduces our dependence on \nforeign and Middle Eastern oil. I would also say that the EPA NSR \nreforms are good for the economy. Companies would now be able to make \nrapid changes to meet their changing business climates without getting \nbogged down in time-consuming Government redtape.\n  The reforms will continue to protect the environment while giving \ncompanies the flexibility they need to get new products to the market \nquickly. We have all of the elements that should go into a forward-\nlooking environmental program. We have made great progress, but we have \nalso developed glitches in our system, and anybody who has thought \nabout the system knows that we need to make it more efficient. We need \nto rationalize it. We need to give it flexibility so environmental \nimprovements can be made with the least hassle.\n  I am talking about environmental improvements. That is what this NSR \nproposal does. It allows not only energy conservation, improved \neconomic performance, but environmental progress as well. What is wrong \nwith that?\n  I have yet to hear what is the objection to providing better \nenvironmental performance in a way that is flexible, that encourages \ncompanies to move forward. This is such a good idea that the last \nadministration supported it. Yes, Mr. President, you heard me right. \nThe last administration supported it. This was one of their proposals. \nThe reforms EPA finalized this winter were actually proposed in 1996 \nduring the Clinton administration by EPA Administrator Carol Browner. I \nthought it was a good idea then; I think it is a good idea now. The \nonly change is there is a new administration, with a different \nPresident.\n  I hope this is not the reason behind some of my colleagues seeking to \nraise the issue and challenge it. If it was a good idea in the Clinton \nadministration, does it become a bad idea in the Bush administration? I \ndon't think so.\n  I think we are on the right track with what the Clinton \nadministration started. The NSR reforms are good for the environment, \nthey are good for energy security, and they are good for the economy.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject the Edwards amendment. I look \nforward--if there is further debate--to responding so that we can deal \nwith this amendment in a timely manner.\n  I yield the floor and, seeing none of my colleagues wishing to speak, \nI suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, on behalf of the leader, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the pending Edwards amendment be temporarily set aside to \nrecur at the hour of 1:30 today, with the majority leader or his \ndesignee recognized when the Senate resumes consideration of the \namendment; further, I ask that Senator Dodd now be recognized in order \nto offer an amendment related to IDEA, and that no second-degree \namendments be in order to the amendment until Senator Gregg or his \ndesignee is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, with the \nSenator's permission--and I know he has the floor--I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I think we \nare headed in the right direction. I wanted to state to my friend that \nSenator Dodd is offering his amendment. He is going to speak for a \nwhile. We have Senator Dayton coming at 1 o'clock. We hope we will get \npermission then to set aside the Dodd amendment so we can consider the \nDayton amendment, which is on corporate expatriation. He should not \ntake too long.\n  I hope the majority will give us consideration to set aside the Dodd \namendment then because, if we are going to work through all of these \namendments, we are going to have to have cooperation on both sides. I \nhave no objection to the unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S1195]]\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the minority whip for his \nexplanation. I can assure the Senator that on this side we want to \naccommodate Senators from both sides of the aisle. We are here in a \nweek when many Senators had other things to do and we need to move \nforward. It is critically important that we get these appropriations \nbills passed because we will be getting close to halfway through the \nyear before these bills can be implemented. I know wherever we can make \naccommodations, we will do so, and the Senator from Nevada has been \nvery gracious in working with us. I know the Senator from Kentucky will \nwork with him.\n  With that, I thank my colleagues and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 71\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, on behalf of myself, Senators Kennedy, \nMikulski, Jeffords, Murray, Edwards, Dayton, Corzine, and Kerry, I send \nan amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Dodd], for himself, Mr. \n     Kennedy, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Jeffords, Mrs. Murray, Mr. \n     Edwards, Mr. Dayton, Mr. Corzine, and Mr. Kerry, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 71.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide additional funding for part B of the Individuals \n                    with Disabilities Education Act)\n\n       On page 1052, line 25, strike ``budget).'' and insert the \n     following: ``budget).\n\n       TITLE __--FUNDING EDUCATION FOR CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES\n\n     SEC. __. HELPING CHILDREN SUCCEED BY FUNDING THE INDIVIDUALS \n                   WITH DISABILITIES EDUCATION ACT (IDEA).\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) All children deserve a quality education.\n       (2) In Pennsylvania Association for Retarded Children vs. \n     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (334 F. Supp. 1247)(E. Dist. Pa. \n     1971), and Mills vs. Board of Education of the District of \n     Columbia (348 F. Supp. 866)(Dist. D.C. 1972), the courts \n     found that children with disabilities are entitled to an \n     equal opportunity to an education under the 14th amendment of \n     the Constitution.\n       (3) In 1975, Congress passed what is now known as the \n     Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (referred to in \n     this section as ``IDEA'') (20 U.S.C. 1400 et seq.) to help \n     States provide all children with disabilities a free, \n     appropriate public education in the least restrictive \n     environment. At full funding, Congress contributes 40 percent \n     of the average per pupil expenditure for each child with a \n     disability served.\n       (4) Before 1975, only \\1/5\\ of the children with \n     disabilities received a formal education. At that time, many \n     States had laws that specifically excluded many children with \n     disabilities, including children who were blind, deaf, or \n     emotionally disturbed, from receiving such an education.\n       (5) IDEA currently serves an estimated 200,000 infants and \n     toddlers, 600,000 preschoolers, and 5,400,000 children 6 to \n     21 years of age.\n       (6) IDEA enables children with disabilities to be educated \n     in their communities, and thus, has assisted in dramatically \n     reducing the number of children with disabilities who must \n     live in State institutions away from their families.\n       (7) The number of children with disabilities who complete \n     high school has grown significantly since the enactment of \n     IDEA.\n       (8) The number of children with disabilities who enroll in \n     college as freshmen has more than tripled since the enactment \n     of IDEA.\n       (9) The overall effectiveness of IDEA depends upon well \n     trained special education and general education teachers, \n     related services personnel, and other school personnel. \n     Congress recognizes concerns about the nationwide shortage of \n     personnel serving students with disabilities and the need for \n     improvement in the qualifications of such personnel.\n       (10) IDEA has raised the Nation's awareness about the \n     abilities and capabilities of children with disabilities.\n       (11) Improvements to IDEA in the 1997 amendments increased \n     the academic achievement of children with disabilities and \n     helped them to lead productive, independent lives.\n       (12) Changes made in 1997 also addressed the needs of those \n     children whose behavior impedes learning by implementing \n     behavioral assessments and intervention strategies to ensure \n     that they receive appropriate supports in order to receive a \n     quality education.\n       (13) IDEA requires a full partnership between parents of \n     children with disabilities and education professionals in the \n     design and implementation of the educational services \n     provided to children with disabilities.\n       (14) While the Federal Government has more than doubled \n     funding for part B of IDEA since 1995, the Federal Government \n     has never provided more than 17 percent of the maximum State \n     grant allocation for educating children with disabilities.\n       (15) By fully funding IDEA, Congress will strengthen the \n     ability of States and localities to implement the \n     requirements of IDEA.\n\n     SEC. __. FUNDING FOR PART B OF THE INDIVIDUALS WITH \n                   DISABILITIES EDUCATION ACT.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     this Act, in addition to any amounts otherwise appropriated \n     under this Act for part B of the Individuals with \n     Disabilities Education Act, other than section 619 of such \n     part, the following sums are appropriated, out of any money \n     in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated for the fiscal \n     year ending September 30, 2003, $1,500,000,000 for carrying \n     out such part, other than section 619 of such part, to remain \n     available through September 30, 2004.\n       (b) Across-the-Board Rescission.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of this Act, funds provided under subsection (a) \n     shall not result in a further across-the-board rescission \n     under section 601 of Division N.''.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, for the benefit of my colleagues, this \namendment will add $1.5 billion to the appropriations omnibus bill for \nthe Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, commonly known as \nIDEA. This is a matter with which all of my colleagues are very \nfamiliar. We have debated this matter on numerous occasions over the \nyears. A brief history about the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act may be in order.\n  It has been almost 30 years--28 years--since Congress passed this \nlegislation in 1975. The promise made in 1975 was that we would provide \nthe States with 40 percent of the funding to educate children with \nspecial education needs. We started out with a far lower commitment, \nand over the years the States have assumed the lion's share of this \nresponsibility. But over the years, we have failed to meet the \ncommitment we made to the States almost 30 years ago.\n  As a result of efforts by this body in the previous Congress, we came \nvery close to achieving the full funding promise that was made many \nyears ago. In fact, our distinguished colleagues and friends, Senator \nJeffords, Senator Hagel, and Senator Harkin, offered an amendment in \nthe previous Congress, which enjoyed unanimous support, to increase the \nfunding over a series of years, that would reach the full funding level \nas required by the agreement reached in 1975.\n  Unfortunately, the President and the Republican leadership of the \nother body refused to agree to the Senate unanimous vote on full \nfunding for special education. As a result of that opposition by the \nPresident and by the leadership of the other body, the bipartisan \nefforts of the Senate and the good work of Senator Hagel, Senator \nJeffords, Senator Harkin, and many of us who have worked on this issue \nover the years failed. In fact, I recall some 15 years ago when I was a \nmember of the Budget Committee and offered in the committee the \nlanguage which required full funding of special education needs. My \nfriend and colleague from Mississippi, Senator Lott, was on that \ncommittee that year. I remember because he cast a vote with me in the \nBudget Committee, but we failed on a tie vote in the Budget Committee \nto get the increased funding.\n  Over the years, we have had good bipartisan support to do everything \nwe could to fully fund IDEA, and every year, for one reason or another, \nCongress finds a way to avoid its responsibility.\n  I do not lay that on the shoulders of the Senate because recently we \nhave met the promise we made. My colleagues here understand and know \nwell how strongly the Governors, mayors, and county executives across \nthis country feel about this issue. This is one of their major issues. \nWhen we ask them what are the important areas in which we can assist \nthem, inevitably over the years they have listed special education as \none of the most important areas in which we can assist them by meeting \nour obligations we made some 30 years ago.\n  When Congress passed the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act \nin 1975, it promised to help States meet their constitutional \nobligation to provide\n\n[[Page S1196]]\n\nchildren with disabilities a free appropriate education by paying for \n40 percent of those costs.\n  The States came to us in 1975 and said: We need your help on this \nissue. As I said, some 30 years ago, we said we would step in and help, \njust as we have done with title I for children who have different kinds \nof needs. Those needs are economic because of the levels of poverty \nacross the country. We said this also is an area where we think the \nFederal Government ought to step up and provide help to the States.\n  The cost of special education--and again, I am preaching to the choir \nwhen I talk to my colleagues about this issue because they know these \nissues as well as, if not better than, I do. Talk to any mayor, county \nexecutive, Governor, Democrat or Republican, liberal or conservative, \nand they will tell you that the cost of special education is very high. \nIn fact, in some small towns--I know in my State and I am confident in \nthe State of the Presiding Officer and the States of my good friends \nfrom Vermont or Rhode Island--two or three children with special \neducation needs can so distort a local budget with the tremendous \nincrease in cost that it becomes almost prohibitive for those smaller \ncommunities to meet the obligations. That is why we have heard so many \nloud voices over so many years calling on us to step up and meet our \nobligation.\n  We made a promise. In 1975, we said: As representatives of the \nFederal Government, we will come up with 40 percent of the cost of this \nprogram. That is our obligation. We will do that. Here we are almost 30 \nyears later, and we have reached a 15-percent level. We are still short \nby some 25 percent of the costs of special education.\n  We have made great strides in going from zero to 15 percent, \nparticularly in the last 4 or 5 years, but we are still way short.\n  The amendment I offer this afternoon provides for an additional $1.5 \nbillion in this omnibus appropriations bill for an additional 1 year. \nThis is not a full-funding amendment. I am not asking in this amendment \nfor full funding over the next several years. Since this bill only \ndeals with 1 fiscal year, I am merely trying to add these additional \ndollars which will get us closer to the obligations.\n  Two years ago, a bipartisan group of 31 Members of this body \nintroduced S. 466 to direct the appropriations of funds, to fully fund \nIDEA by 2007. That bill was the foundation of the Harkin-Hagel \namendment to the No Child Left Behind Act. The amendment passed by the \nSenate on a unanimous vote would have increased Federal support for \nspecial education by $2.5 billion per year until we reach full funding. \nUnfortunately, as I mentioned a few moments ago, because of strong \nopposition from the President of the United States and the Republican \nHouse leadership, the provision adopted unanimously by this body was \nnot included in the final No Child Left Behind Act. It made an oxymoron \nof the title of that bill, No Child Left Behind, when, in fact, we \nexcluded the kids with special education needs from the legislation. So \nit was No Child Left Behind unless you have special education needs and \ndisabilities.\n  Today's amendment will enable us once again as a bipartisan Senate to \ntake the first step that we recommitted ourselves to in 2001 by \nincreasing the funding for special education by $2.5 billion for fiscal \nyear 2002 to 2003. We are calling upon our colleagues to do just that.\n  In my State of Connecticut, in spite of spending hundreds of millions \nof dollars to fund special education programs, our school districts--as \nis true in almost every other State in the country--are struggling to \nmeet the needs of their students with disabilities.\n  The costs borne by local communities and school districts are rising \ndramatically. From 1992 through 1997, for example, special education \ncosts in Connecticut rose half again as much as did regular education \ncosts. Our schools need our help, and this amendment is an opportunity, \nas we begin this 108th Congress, to do just that.\n  Of course, no one in my State--or any other State, for that matter, \nin our great Nation--questions the value of making sure the Individuals \nwith Disabilities Education Act, which is both a landmark education law \nand a landmark civil rights law, be fully implemented. The only \nquestion is how best to do that, and a large part of the answer lies in \nthis amendment.\n  This amendment will demonstrate that we intend to match our \ncommitment to universal access to education with a commitment to do \neverything we can to help our States and schools provide that access. \nThis amendment, further, will help not only our children in schools, \nbut it will also help entire communities by easing their tax burden.\n  Our failure to fully fund IDEA does not make the issue go away. When \nwe do not meet our obligation, then a mayor or county executive at the \nlocal level has no alternative; they have to, under their \nconstitutions, meet these responsibilities. So when we duck our \nresponsibility, we only increase the burdens locally. They can slash \ntheir budgets locally in other vitally needed areas or they can \nincrease taxes.\n  As all of us know, there are not many options left at the local \nlevel. At the local level, that is where the rubber hits the road, \nwhere people need and require that certain obligations be met. \nUnfortunately, when we do not step to the plate and fulfill our \npromises on the national level, then we only increase tremendously the \nburden on our Governors, mayors, and county executives all across this \ngreat country.\n  Homeowners and businesspeople end up paying higher taxes or watch \nservices they depend upon be slashed, not only in my own State, but all \naround this country, because so much of education is paid for through \nlocal property taxes.\n  Again, I do not need to recite to my colleagues the tremendous \nburdens that are being felt by local and State budgets all across this \ncountry. The estimates are now that deficits running at the State level \nmay hover around $100 billion this year and only get worse next year \nand the year after. In my State alone, it is about half a billion this \nyear. My Governor tells me it is going to be about $1.3 billion next \nyear. I do not know what it is in the State of Alabama, but I presume \nit might be like what Connecticut is. I think California is around $34 \nbillion.\n  I heard some of my colleagues say the other day, in Michigan it is $4 \nbillion or $5 billion. I think someone said in Minnesota it was like $4 \nbillion or $5 billion.\n  We have these mounting deficits at the State and local level. There \nis a need in special education. There was a promise made some 30 years \nago by the Federal Government. What I am asking for in this amendment \non the omnibus bill is that we take out the $1.5 billion, if we could, \nand see if we cannot step in and provide some real relief for our \nStates and localities in their hour of need and the need of families \nwho have a child with special needs.\n  The President recently proposed another plan to cut taxes by hundreds \nof billions of dollars for some of the wealthiest Americans. I \nrepresent one of the most affluent States in the country. I probably \nhave a higher percentage of my population who would benefit very \ndirectly as a result of the President's tax proposals. Without \nequivocation or hesitation, the overwhelming majority of the people in \nmy State, including the most affluent, honestly believe the best use of \nresources is things such as special education. While they, as everyone \nelse, would love to have a tax cut--there is nothing new about that--\nwhen asked to balance the priorities and needs of a nation, they \nunderstand providing tax relief for people in the top 1, 2 or 3 percent \nof income earners in the country at a moment such as this is not a wise \nor prudent use of the resources of this Nation when there are so many \nother demands that must be met.\n  I understand the Federal Government faces the same budget challenges \nin today's slumping economy as do our States and towns, but we cannot \naccept the argument that because our economy is faltering we cannot \nprovide our children and their families with critical educational \nresources and otherwise help average Americans. We would and should not \naccept that argument if our homeland security or national defense were \nat stake, and we certainly cannot afford to do it here, either.\n  Investment in education is no less important now than it was when our \neconomy was more healthy. It is essential to our long-term national \neconomic security. So I ask my colleagues\n\n[[Page S1197]]\n\nto seize this opportunity and choose to help our schools but, more \nimportantly, our families and young children who need these resources \nin order to maximize their potential.\n  I do not know of anyone, regardless of to which party they belong, \nConservative, Liberal or moderate, whatever label one wants to put on \nthemselves politically, that when they look in the eyes of a child who \nhas special needs, can say, I am sorry right now but we cannot provide \nthe resources to their town, county, local, or our State government \nbecause we have these other priorities that are making too many demands \non us. That is not my America.\n  My America says, when there is a child with disabilities in need we \nstep to the plate and provide them the kind of help they ought to have \nso they have a chance to become independent and maximize their \npotential to see to it that they can be productive citizens and add to \nthe great strength and wealth of our Nation.\n  I can go down the list of the various States and what they will lose \nor gain. At the end of my statement, I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record a letter written on January 16, 2003, to the \nmajority leader, Senator Frist, and the minority leader, Senator \nDaschle, in which they specifically go down and list the importance of \nthis amendment and the funding I am asking for, the $1.5 billion, as \none of their top priorities. In fact, they list it as the top priority.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. DODD. There are a whole list of organizations that support full \nfunding for IDEA. I ask unanimous consent to have that list printed in \nthe Record at the end of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. DODD. I am not asking for full funding with this amendment. I am \nasking for the $1.5 billion in this omnibus appropriations bill. I am \nconfident every one of these organizations would support this \namendment, even though it is not full funding, but rather the \nadditional amounts this year when we consider the pressures on our \nStates.\n  Lastly, in looking at the differences in our States--the top State on \nthe list is that of the Presiding Officer--the difference right away \nwhere there is a gap between what I am offering and the omnibus bill, \nit is a little less than $30 million in the State of Alabama, and this \namendment would make up the difference. Going down further, in my own \nState of Connecticut, the difference would be about $18 million. In the \nState of Vermont, the difference would be about $3 million. In the \nState of Rhode Island, the difference would be about $5 million in this \namendment. What a difference it would make.\n  I saw my colleague from Missouri in the Chamber recently. In the \nState of Missouri, the difference would be about $30 million.\n  I have all 50 States listed and the difference that this $1.5 billion \ncould make. That may not sound like much when a State is facing \nbillions of dollars in deficits, but the fact that we might step up to \nthe plate in Nevada--I apologize to my friend of Nevada, who is sitting \nright in front of me, but I did not see him--it is about $10 million in \nhis State.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this list printed in the Record at \nthe end of my statement. It is printed on both sides of one sheet of \npaper. Members can then have an idea of what the benefit of this small \namendment could mean to them and their States.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 3.)\n  Mr. DODD. There are other Members who want to be heard on this issue. \nAs we begin this debate in this Congress, this is one area on which we \nought to find common ground. We will have our differences on other \nissues but every one of our States, Governors, mayors, and families \nwith children with disabilities are asking us to step up and do what we \ncan for them. As we start out in the year 2003, this modest amendment \ncould make such a difference to people across this country and is \nsomething we ought to be able to join forces together on and adopt.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                               National Governors Association,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 16, 2003.\n     Hon. Bill Frist,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, the Capitol, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Tom Daschle,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, the Capitol, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Frist and Senator Daschle: On behalf of the \n     nation's Governors, we are writing to express our support for \n     several key provisions of the (FY) 2003 omnibus \n     appropriations bill affecting state programs. First, we \n     appreciate that the bill would maintain the FY 2003 highway \n     program investment level at $31.8 billion. With a sluggish \n     economy and many states facing budgetary difficulties, now is \n     not the time to cut federal highway investment. In addition, \n     Governors strongly support the $1.5 billion provided in the \n     bill to implement the new election reform law. We also \n     appreciate that the bill includes an extension of the \n     Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant \n     and related programs through September 30, 2003. It is \n     critical that states have reliability of funds in order to \n     continue operating their welfare reform programs while \n     Congress considers TANF reauthorization.\n       We would also like to express our support for the following \n     amendments:\n       Dodd Amendment. The Governors support Senator Dodd's \n     amendment calling for a $1.5 billion increase in state grants \n     for special education. We are committed to continuously \n     improving the academic performance of all students, including \n     students with disabilities. The nation's Governors support \n     this amendment and urge Congress to continue to work toward \n     enacting legislation that makes the Individuals with \n     Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) funding a mandatory \n     expenditure with incremental increases towards meeting the 40 \n     percent federal requirement.\n       Murray amendment. The Governors support providing the \n     necessary funding for Amtrak to support the continuation of a \n     national passenger rail system as proposed by Senator Murray. \n     Amtrak must be provided a sufficient level of funding to \n     guarantee there will be no break or threat of a break in \n     service. We must be certain that Amtrak will not encounter \n     the rolling financial crises it experienced during the past \n     year.\n       Chafee-Rockefeller amendment. The nation's Governors urge \n     your support for quick action on a bipartisan compromise to \n     protect resources in the State Children's Health Insurance \n     Program (S-CHIP). Preserving the S-CHIP funds that have \n     reverted to the federal treasury would keep $1.2 billion of \n     the FY 1998 and FY 1999 allocations within the program until \n     2004.\n       Harkin amendment. The Governors urge support for restoring \n     current funding levels to the Edward Byrne block grant \n     program for state and local law enforcement activities.\n       Finally, while Governors appreciate the inclusion of $2 \n     billion for first responder grants, we urge support for the \n     President's original request of providing $3.5 billion \n     coordinated through the states. Just as Congress and the \n     President have responded by acting on a far-reaching \n     reorganization and consolidation of federal agencies, so too \n     the President recognized the critical role of states--the \n     first line of defense and the first line of coordination of \n     response to any attack. Thus, this should be meaningful, new \n     resources that respect the diversity, responsibilities, and \n     capabilities of states and the immediate need for resources \n     for national defense. Therefore, we encourage you to add an \n     additional $1.5 billion in first responder grant funds to the \n     $2 billion, so that we meet the President's recognition of \n     the need to be prepared to respond to and recover from any \n     terrorist attacks.\n       We greatly appreciate your consideration of our views.\n           Sincerely,\n     Governor Paul E. Patton,\n       Chairman.\n     Governor Dirk Kempthorne,\n       Vice Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n            Organizations in

In this \ninstance, I hope the children Senator Dodd has talked about would be \ntaken into consideration.\n  As indicated, it would be so important to the State of Nevada. It is \na modest increase but it would certainly take care of a lot of problems \nthat the school districts have in Nevada.\n  Again, I congratulate my friend from Connecticut and hope very much \nthis amendment will pass.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, like the Senator from Connecticut, I was \nhere in 1975. This was an unusual year for Republicans. This was the \nWatergate year, and I was one of the very few who was enabled by the \npolitical process to represent the State of Vermont at that time. \nBecause there were so few Republicans at that time, the day I walked on \nthe floor, I ended up being the ranking member on the Select Education \nCommittee which handled this issue in the House. Thus I have a personal \nunderstanding of the need and a personal responsibility. Ted Kennedy \nwas on that conference committee with the Senate, Bob Stafford was \nanother one, and John Brademas was the wonderful leader of the \nDemocrats at that time. We struggled over how much money would be \nneeded. We came up with a solution and then agreed the Federal \nGovernment ought to come up with 45 percent of the burden that was \nplaced upon the States.\n  I stand today somewhat sad in the sense we still have not reached \nthat promise or anywhere near it. We are about half of that now. I look \nat severe cuts that have occurred and the lack of money for the States \nand see they are imperiled at this point to be able to give not only a \ngood education, as required in the constitutional mandate, to young \npeople with special needs but also of all children because of the dire \ncircumstances we have.\n  I first thank my good friend, Senator Dodd, for bringing this \nimportant amendment to the floor. This amendment is about making sure \nthat all children have an opportunity to learn, and I want to urge my \ncolleagues to support this very critical amendment.\n\n  We must recognize that we cannot provide all of our children with the \nopportunity to achieve unless we support our children with adequate \nresources. The level of funding for education in this omnibus \nappropriations bill is unconsicionable.\n  When I first arrived in Congress in 1975, one of the first \nlegislative initiatives I worked on was the Education for All \nHandicapped Children Act, now known as IDEA. We wrote the legislation \nto ensure that children with disabilities receive the special education \nand related services they need and deserve. This is expensive.\n  We also recognized, however, that educating children with \ndisabilities would be very costly, and therefore promised that the \nFederal Government would pay 40 percent of the excess cost of educating \nchildren with disabilities.\n  At that time, nearly half of all disabled children, approximately 2 \nmillion children, were not receiving a public education. They were not \neven in school. Another 2 million children were placed in segregated, \ninadequate classrooms. It was brutal.\n  Today, IDEA serves approximately 6 million disabled children. IDEA \nhas been very successful in providing the basic constitutional right of \nan education to our children with disabilities: dropout rates have \ndecreased, graduation rates have increased, and the percentage of \ncollege freshmen with a disability has almost tripled.\n  IDEA has helped individuals with disabilities become independent, \nwage-earning, tax-paying contributors to this Nation.\n  The problem, however, is that we have not kept our promise of helping \nthe States pay for the costs of educating children with disabilities. \nAlthough Congress has increased IDEA funding in recent years, it has \nwoefully failed to meet its obligation to fully fund IDEA. Until we do \nthat, we will not have done what we promised.\n\n[[Page S1199]]\n\n  Rather than contributing the 40 percent as promised, currently, we \nonly pay about 17 percent.\n  I would like to recognize Senators Harkin and Hagel, and, of course \nSenator Dodd, for their unyielding commitment to our children and to \nour schools, and I look forward to continuing to work with them to \nfully fund IDEA.\n  The underlying appropriations bill only increases IDEA funding by $1 \nbillion. At that rate, we're on course to fully fund IDEA in the year \n2035. I know that the children of Vermont, and the children across this \ncountry, cannot wait another 32 years.\n  And yet, as we continue to underfund IDEA, the costs associated with \neducating children with disabilities continue to rise and absorb \nincreasingly larger portions of school districts' budgets.\n  For example, in my State of Vermont, the special education costs have \nincreased by 150 percent over the past 10 years, and the Federal \nunderfunding leads to the State and local districts to spend \napproximately $20 million more from local sources than if Federal \nfunding were provided at the maximum level. I know that these problems \nare not unique to Vermont; but rather, they are shared by States and \nschool districts across the country.\n  And now State governments are battling the worst fiscal conditions \nsince World War II. According to the National Governors Association, \nbudget shortfalls will be as high as $50 billion this year and $60 to \n$70 billion next year. Accordingly, State education budgets throughout \nthe country are facing severe cuts, and schools must take drastic \nmeasures just to make ends meet, no less meet the burdensome mandates \nof the No Child Left Behind law.\n  This amendment represents a significant step forward providing some \nrelief to our schools, and I emphasize the word ``some.'' We must \nrecognize that we cannot provide all of our children with the \nopportunity to achieve unless we support our children with adequate \nresources. We must provide our schools with those desperately needed \nresources and perhaps then we can ensure that, indeed, not one of our \nchildren is left behind. The President has made that promise, but I see \nnothing in the budget or anywhere else that indicates an attempt to \nbear that cost our States have shouldered for so long. This amendment \nbrings us that little bit closer to our obligation to America's \nchildren. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and vote yes.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to lay aside the \npending amendment and ask for immediate consideration of amendment No. \n27, which is at the desk.\n  Mr. GREGG. Reserving the right to object, I regret I have to object \nto this until we can clarify where we stand vis-a-vis this amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REED. I yield.\n  Mr. REID. It is my understanding you will offer an amendment in a \ndifferent form than the Dodd amendment, and there would be two side-by-\nside amendments; is that right?\n  Mr. GREGG. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. We are working on that. I spoke to Senator Dodd and he \nfeels we would have 30 minutes equally divided prior to the vote.\n  Mr. GREGG. That would be reasonable. Assuming all debate on the \namendment of Senator Dodd--that there is no further amendment, with \ndebate going forward until that time.\n  Mr. DODD. If the minority whip will yield, my intention was to make a \nfew additional comments, but I have spoken on the amendment. I would \nlike some idea of when we might do this. I know the Senator from Rhode \nIsland has an amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. I suggest, if the Democrat assistant leader is so \ninclined, we now have a vote at 5:15. Why not begin at what time before \nthat?\n  Mr. REID. The two leaders have to work out what the sequence of votes \nis going to be. We have the Dodd amendment which has been laid down. We \nhave the Edwards amendment which is pending. We have Senator Reed of \nRhode Island offering an amendment on LIHEAP, cosponsored with Senator \nCollins. We have Senator Dayton coming in a few minutes to offer one on \ncorporate expatriation. They have to figure out the sequencing of \nvotes. We are trying to do as we have been told--to offer as many \namendments as possible. I suggest this can be worked out between the \nSenators from New Hampshire and Connecticut, but we would like to get \nto this.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, how much time does Senator Reed require?\n  Mr. REED. Around 10 or 15 minutes. No longer.\n  Mr. GREGG. I suggest after Senator Reed completes the presentation of \nhis amendment, we go back to the Dodd amendment. Hopefully, I can lay \ndown my amendment and spend up to an hour, equally divided, on it at \nthat point and proceed to the next item of business.\n  Mr. REID. If my friend will withhold, my only point is that we have \nbeen trying to do as your leader wants us to do and line up a bunch of \namendments. We have Senator Dayton coming at 1 o'clock, and I have \nannounced that previously. He is not going to take too long. But I am \nhappy to go along with what the Senator suggested. We will get the Reed \namendment laid down and come back to the Dodd amendment.\n  Mr. DODD. That is fine. We have a couple of other Members, I have \njust been informed, who would like to speak on the special education \namendment. They are not here yet because of the conditions outside. In \norder to accommodate our colleague from Rhode Island, who is here--and \nSenator Dayton from Minnesota is on his way--we could work up a \nproposal and come back later in the afternoon when the other Members \nare here and finish up the debate on that and allow these other \namendments to be debated, since those Senators are here.\n  Mr. GREGG. I would like to get back to getting the floor at a \nreasonable point of time. I suggest at 2 o'clock I be recognized to \noffer my amendment.\n  Mr. REID. I think the Senator's original suggestion is the better of \nthe two. I ask unanimous consent the Dodd amendment be set aside and \nSenator Reed be recognized to offer his amendment, speak up to 15 \nminutes, and then we will return to the Dodd amendment and try to work \nout something.\n  Mr. REED. Reserving my right to object, Senator Collins of Maine, \nalso a cosponsor, wants to speak on this amendment.\n  Mr. REID. There will be ample time later for her to do that.\n  Mr. REED. So her rights will be protected.\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 27\n\n  (Purpose: To provide additional amounts for low-income home energy \n                              assistance)\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I am offering an amendment today to increase \nfunding for the LIHEAP program, the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance \nProgram, to $2 billion for this fiscal year. I am offering this \namendment with my colleague and friend from Maine, Senator Susan \nCollins. Senator Collins wanted to be here to offer the amendment with \nme, but she is traveling from Maine in very difficult weather \ncircumstances today, and when she arrives this afternoon she will take \nthe floor to speak on behalf of this amendment.\n  I also thank my colleagues, Senator Dayton, Senator Snowe, Senator \nJeffords, Senator Kennedy, Senator DeWine, Senator Sarbanes, Senator \nCantwell, Senator Stabenow, Senator Clinton, Senator Dodd, Senator \nKerry, Senator Levin, Senator Corzine, Senator Leahy, and Senator \nDurbin, who are all cosponsors of this amendment.\n  At this juncture I ask unanimous consent that Senators Chafee, \nSchumer, Harkin, Fitzgerald, Murray, Bingaman, and Lautenberg be added \nas cosponsors of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. As you can see, this amendment enjoys widespread and \nbipartisan support. I think it is clear, particularly given the weather \ntoday, that support is not unmerited.\n  Let me begin by offering a weather report, if you will. It is today, \nin Washington, around 30 degrees. But if you are outside, it feels much \ncolder. The low will be somewhere around 14 degrees.\n\n[[Page S1200]]\n\n  As you go along the country: Albany, NY, today, 17 degrees the high; \nBaltimore, 29 degrees; Chicago, 18 degrees; Cleveland, 15 degrees; Des \nMoines, IA, 12 degrees; Detroit, MI, 18 degrees; Milwaukee, 14 degrees; \nOmaha, 12 degrees; and my State, Rhode Island, they list the high as \n23, but this morning when I left at 5 a.m. it was 5 degrees, but with \nthe wind chill factor it was below zero.\n  This amendment is important because there are Americans who are \nsuffering because of the cold. But it is not just about cold weather in \ncertain parts of the country at this time of the year; the LIHEAP \nprogram is also important since it covers those hot stretches in the \nsummertime when energy bills in the Southwest and the Southeast are \nastronomical and impact adversely low-income Americans.\n  We need this program throughout the year. We particularly need it \ntoday to protect people from the cold, but, as I said, those \nindividuals who live in Alabama or Arkansas or Texas or southern \nCalifornia need LIHEAP in the summertime and it should be there for \nthem, as it should be for those people who struggle today with the cold \nweather in the Northeast and Midwest.\n  In fact, yesterday the coldest place in America was Embarras, MN, \nminus 26 degrees. It is one thing to be in Embarras, but it is also \nsomething else to be freezing in Embarras. So I think we have to do \nsomething to ensure that we can protect low-income Americans from the \ncold that is affecting them today.\n  Twenty-five years ago Congress passed the LIHEAP program. They knew \nthat people struggling with all sorts of expenses--raising a family, \nproviding food to put on the table--they needed help in these cold \nmonths in the Northeast and those hot spells in the Southeast, to \nprovide for assistance so they could afford the energy they needed.\n\n  During his campaign, President Bush promised to fully fund LIHEAP to \nhelp these low-income families meet their needs for heat in the winter \nand cooling in the summer. If he stood by his promise, the President \nwould demand the $2 billion for which we are asking; rather, he has \nproposed cutting that money. This year, despite rising energy prices, \ncolder weather, and increased unemployment, the President's budget has \nproposed to cut LIHEAP by $300 million. This cut would deny assistance \nto literally hundreds of thousands of Americans. The appropriations \nbill that we are considering today does restore part of this funding. I \ncommend and thank Senators Stevens and Byrd and Specter and Harkin and \ntheir staffs for their hard work to maintain this funding, but we want \nto restore an additional $300 million to bring it up to the $2 billion \nlevel that will just be, in terms of purchasing power, equal to last \nyear. We want to do that and I hope we can do that today through this \namendment process.\n  As I said, we could add this $300 million, but we are not requesting \nnew funding. This amendment simply requires the administration to give \nthe States the $300 million the Congress provided in the fiscal year \n2001 Supplemental Appropriations Act. Congress provided $300 million in \nLIHEAP funding 2 years ago to help these families meet their needs when \nenergy costs increase, when there are significant disconnections of \nutilities because if you can't pay the gas bill or electric bill, \neventually you will be disconnected and you will be without any type of \nenergy.\n  All of these efforts in terms of funding LIHEAP have been urged on \nthe present administration by the Governors. They understand because \nthey are right there in the trenches, if you will, dealing with the \nissue of people literally freezing today and sweltering in the \nsummertime.\n  Cutting heating assistance for seniors and low-income Americans is \nnot the way to go, particularly when it is juxtaposed against proposed \nsignificant tax cuts. If we can't at least provide people with a warm \nshelter in the winter and a cool shelter in the summer when thinking \nabout large-scale tax cuts, to me, seems somewhat inappropriate.\n  LIHEAP, even with our amendment, will be seriously underfunded. \nProviding this $2 billion in regular funding to the program will just \nequal the purchasing power of last year. What it does not recognize is \nthat energy prices are soaring. Today, on the front page of the \nProvidence Journal, there is an article about the cold wave that is \nsweeping our region of the country, but also the fact that in order to \nkeep up with the demand for oil, which is our principal fuel, because \nthe demand is so huge, our Governor had to suspend regulations to allow \ndelivery drivers to work through periods of time when they are normally \nrequired to rest. What is also happening is the prices are jumping up \nbecause of uncertainty in Venezuela and uncertainty in the gulf.\n  This combination of increased prices, cold temperatures, and also an \neconomy that sees more and more people unemployed, is the perfect \nstorm, if you will, when it comes to requiring assistance for heating \nthroughout the Northeast in particular.\n  There is something else that happens when people are challenged for \nenergy, when they do without. They take their own improvisational means \nto keep warm. They turn the electric stove on and open up the oven. \nThey go out and buy portable heaters. It is more than coincidence that \nthe number of house fires shows a sharp increase in the months of cold \nweather in the Northeast because people are improvising. So this is \nanother danger that must be recognized.\n  This amendment simply allows people to stay warm in the winter and to \nescape scorching heat in the summertime. It is something that is basic. \nIt is something I believe we should support extensively. I am pleased \nand proud that so many of my colleagues have joined Senator Collins and \nme on a bipartisan basis. I hope this is one amendment we can quickly \nadopt and include in this omnibus appropriations bill. I hope, also, we \ncan at least signal to those people who are looking for some modest \nassistance in these cold days that we have heard their calls, we are \nresponding to our political leaders at the State level, the Governors, \nand we are giving them the resources to at least keep people from \nfreezing in a very difficult time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator calling up his amendment?\n  Mr. REED. I asked in my initial statement that we call up amendment \nNo. 27. I ask now it be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Rhode Island (Mr. REED) for himself, Ms. \n     Collins, Mr. Dayton, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Kennedy, \n     Mr. Sarbanes, Ms. Cantwell, Ms. Stabenow, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. \n     Dodd, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Levin, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Leahy, Mr. \n     Durbin, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Harkin, Mrs. \n     Murray, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Lautenberg, and Mr. Rockefeller, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 27.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To provide additional amounts for low-income home energy \n                              assistance)\n\n       At the end of the general provisions relating to the \n     Department of Health and Human Services, add the following:\n       Sec. __. The Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2001 (Public \n     Law 107-020) is amended, in the matter under the heading \n     ``low income home energy assistance'' under the heading \n     ``Administration for Children and Families'' under the \n     heading ``DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES'', in \n     chapter 7 of title II, by striking ``amount for'' and all \n     that follows, and inserting the following: ``amount for \n     making payments under title XXVI of the Omnibus Budget \n     Reconciliation Act of 1981, $300,000,000.''.\n\n  Mr. REED. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am very pleased to support this \nbipartisan amendment to provide additional funds for the Low Income \nHome Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). At a time when home heating \nprices are increasing dramatically and temperatures in my home state of \nVermont are plunging, we can ill afford cuts in the LIHEAP program.\n  I have fought for years to make sure that no Vermonter has to choose \nbetween heating and other of life's necessities such as putting food on \nthe table or prescription drugs. I am very mindful of the financial \nstrains that low-income Vermonters feel when the weather gets cold.\n  We must continue to make sure that funding for LIHEAP is a priority \nof this administration and of the Congress. I am hopeful that LIHEAP \nwill continue to provide a safety net to families and the elderly who \nare buffeted by high fuel prices, loss of benefits, and sickness.\n\n[[Page S1201]]\n\n  I am going to close this short statement with this week's forecast \nfrom the National Weather Service for Chittenden County. In very stark \nterms, more than any speech, it demonstrates the need for LIHEAP in \nVermont.\n  Tonight. Mostly clear and bitterly cold. Low 10 to 15 below zero. \nNorthwest wind 10 to 20 mph early tonight. Diminishing to 10 mph late. \nWind chills 20 to 25 below zero.\n  Wednesday. Mostly sunny and continued very cold. High around zero. \nNorthwest wind 10 to 15 mph.\n  Wednesday night. Increasing clouds. Low 10 below to 20 below.\n  Thursday. Becoming cloudy with light snow likely in the afternoon. \nHigh 5 to 15 above. Chance of snow 60 percent.\n  Thursday night. Mostly cloudy with a chance of snow showers. Low 5 \nbelow to 5 above. Chance of snow 30 percent.\n  Friday. Partly cloudy. High 10 to 15.\n  Saturday. Partly cloudy. Low 5 below to 5 above and high in the \nteens.\n  Sunday. Cloudy with a chance of snow. Low 5 below to 5 above and high \nin the lower 20s.\n  Monday. A chance of snow showers. Otherwise partly cloudy. Low zero \nto 10 above and high in the lower 20s.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of this \namendment, which I am proud to cosponsor to provide an additional $300 \nmillion in Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program--or LIHEAP--funds \nfor the current fiscal year.\n  With unemployment rising, temperatures dropping, and energy prices \nprojected to soar, New Yorkers and others around the country need \naccess to energy assistance more than ever. Colder than normal \ntemperatures in October, November, December, and January have boosted \noverall heating demands above previous expectations. In fact, \nconditions this winter are projected to be as much as 18 percent colder \nthan last winter, according to the U.S. Energy Information \nAdministration.\n  People in my state know what cold means. Ask anyone who has been to \nBuffalo where it feels like zero degrees Fahrenheit today; Rochester \nwhere it feels like 6 degrees; Syracuse where it feels like 5 degrees; \nBinghamton where it feels like minus 2 degrees; Plattsburgh where it \nfeels like minus 7 degrees; Albany where it feels like minus 2 degrees; \nor any town in New York State in the winter months. It's cold.\n  Today, the National Weather Service has issued a hazardous weather \noutlook for western and north central New York. Very cold air will \ndominate the region overnight, with temperatures again falling into the \nsingle digits from the Finger Lakes west, and below zero to the east. \nAccording to the Weather Service, these temperatures will combine with \nwinds to produce bitterly cold wind chills below minus 15 degrees in \nmost areas, and below minus 20 degrees in the North Country.\n  So far this year, it has snowed just about every day in Oswego \nCounty. Twice this month, lake-effect storms dumped several feet of \nsnow on the county. In the city of Oswego, snow fell at a rate of 6 \ninches per hour for about 4 hours last Wednesday.\n  So it's no surprise that applications for LIHEAP assistance in New \nYork State are up from last year--by at least 9,000 households.\n  That is why instead of proposing to cut this vital program by $300 \nmillion as the Bush Administration has done, we are here today offering \nan amendment to increase the funding for LIHEAP provided in this bill \nby $300 million. The $300 million cut proposed by the Bush \nadministration would have forced the State of New York to ``freeze \nout'' an estimated 80,000 families who previously benefited from the \nvital LIHEAP program.\n  Under this amendment, New York and other states will be able to help \ntens of thousands more families with home heating assistance, rather \nthan leaving families--literally--out in the cold. The change in \nseasons needs to be accompanied by a change of heart--and that is why \nwe are here today offering this amendment.\n  An additional $60 million in LIHEAP funding that was released to New \nYork State earlier this month received a warm welcome--particularly \nfrom the thousands of New York families that are now able to heat their \nhoes without having to forgo other, basic household expenses--like \nbuying groceries. And this additional $300 million will receive an \nequally warm welcome.\n  I want to commend our colleagues on the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee who voted last year not to cut the LIHEAP program as was \nproposed by the administration, but rather to keep it at its previous \nlevel of $1.7 billion. Thankfully, the bill we are considering today \ncontains approximately $1.6 billion in LIHEAP funding for the current \nfiscal year. But that is still not enough.\n  Many of my colleagues and I have asked the administration to release \nthe hundreds of millions of dollars in emergency funds that are still \navailable in order to help low-income families and the elderly in New \nYork and around the country pay their heating bills. With our economy \nin crisis, this is no time to be heaping additional financial burdens \non our low income residents and forcing them to choose between paying \nfor food and paying their energy bill.\n  That is why we are offering this amendment today, to convert $300 \nmillion in already-appropriated emergency LIHEAP funds to regular \nprogram funds, so that these funds can be spent now to help families in \nneed. Because for low-income families and the elderly in New York State \nand around the country who are having to choose between food and \nheating their homes, between prescription drugs and heating their \nhomes--this is an emergency, not question about it.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support this common sense amendment to \nprovide an additional $300 million in regular program funding for the \nLow-Income Home Energy Assistance Program.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to support my colleagues' \namendment increasing LIHEAP funding. In Wisconsin the Low Income Home \nEnergy Assistance Program is not a luxury but a necessity. Many people \naround my State depend on this funding to heat their home and protect \ntheir families, especially in this economy. Already this heating season \nthe State of Wisconsin has almost 4,000 more people being served by \nLIHEAP than last year at this time. This 13 percent increase is a sign \nof the high energy prices and worsening economy putting the squeeze on \nfamilies. The price of the program has skyrocketed as well, almost $8 \nmillion more than last year at this time for a 36 percent increase in \ncost. The small increase from last year proposed in the underlying bill \nwill not be sufficient to meet the needs of my constituents. Without \nthe additional $300 million called for in this amendment, Wisconsin \nwill run out of funding in early May, almost a month earlier than in \nyears past.\n  Constituents are calling and writing my office concerned about \nrunning out of LIHEAP assistance. They are unemployed and facing steep \nbills for energy as well as rent and health care and they are worried \nthey won't be able to make ends meet. The average benefit in my state \nis $369, an amount that would be almost impossible for a family on \nunemployment to pay. Heating a house through the Wisconsin winter is \nmore expensive and takes more energy than cooling a house through a \nsummer down south. We have to recognize that challenge and help these \npeople.\n  The $1.7 billion in the bill still leaves 8,803 people in my state \nwithout benefits. Almost 9,000 people who are eligible for LIHEAP will \ngo without because there is not enough money. There are thousands in my \nstate who need this money but do not apply because they don't know \nabout the program or don't realize they are eligible. The money today \nis only the tip of the iceberg. This extra $300 million will help reach \nthese folks who are not being helped, and will help them pay their \nbills until the heating season is over.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in strong support \nof Senator Reed's amendment, which would ensure that the Low Income \nHome Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) is funded at an amount close to \nthe level authorized by the Senate for the current fiscal year.\n  As he traveled through colder climate areas in the Northeast and \nMidwest in 2000, President Bush campaigned on a promise to fully fund \nthis vital program, which assists senior citizens and low-income \nhouseholds with their basic home heating costs.\n\n[[Page S1202]]\n\nRegrettably, the President decided to retreat from this commitment, \nproposing $1.4 billion for LIHEAP in his fiscal year 2003 budget--a \n$300 million cut from the previous year's funding level for the \nprogram.\n  Meanwhile, plunging temperatures and rising heating costs are putting \nsome of the most vulnerable Americans at risk this winter. Indeed, only \na fraction of those eligible to receive LIHEAP assistance will actually \nbenefit from the program at current funding levels. Furthermore, \nheating bills are significantly higher than they were at this point \nlast year. According to the Energy Information Administration, which \nreleased its monthly short-term outlook on January 8th, the price of \nnatural gas has risen 34 percent compared to last winter's costs. \nHeating oil prices have increased a remarkable 43 percent.\n  Senator Reed's amendment would increase LIHEAP funding for the \ncurrent fiscal year to a level close to the Senate-authorized amount of \n$2 billion by transferring the funds already appropriated by Congress \nin the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2001--but not spent \nby the President--to the omnibus appropriations bill now pending before \nthe Senate. This important amendment will ensure that the \nadministration does not deny these funds to the scores of households \nwho desperately need this assistance to simply keep warm this winter.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the Reed amendment.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of this \namendment to provide much-needed assistance to our Nation's low-income \nfamilies. The amendment before us today would use $300 million in \ncontingency funds included in the fiscal year 2001 supplemental \nappropriations bill be provide additional money for states struggling \nto keep pace with demand for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance \nProgram.\n  The Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, LIHEAP, provides \ncritical aid to many of our Nation's most vulnerable citizens. \nAccording to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association, as \nmany as 5 million households received LIHEAP assistance during fiscal \nyear 2001--the last year for which such data is available.\n  Since then, of course, the need for this program has grown almost \nexponentially. In many places--particularly in the western part of our \ncountry--the downturn in our nation's economy has conspired with \nsoaring retail energy costs to create record-breaking demand for LIHEAP \ndollars.\n  I want to explain to my colleagues precisely why this amendment is so \nimportant to so many families in my state. On a number of previous \noccasions--during debate on the Senate energy bill, at various \njunctures during the Western energy crisis and the ensuing \ninvestigations of Enron and others--I have spoken on this floor about \nthe Bush administration's failure to step in and stem the economic \nbleeding in my state resulting from skyrocketing electricity prices. \nBut not only did this administration sit idly by as Enron and others \nconspired to wreak havoc on the economy of the West, this \nadministration has also ignored repeated pleas to release the LIHEAP \nmoney that would aid those very citizens who have suffered the most \nfrom its inaction.\n  As my colleagues may recall, during the height of the western energy \ncrisis--which we now know resulted at least in part from the \nmanipulations of Enron and potentially other energy companies--\nwholesale electricity prices spiked to as much as 1,000 percent above \nnormal.\n  While prices on the wholesale markets have now stabilized, one \ndaunting reality we face in Washington state is that, despite a series \nof rate increases that had reached almost 50 percent in some areas by \nSeptember 2001, the worst of this crisis is not yet over. The \nBonneville Power Administration, which markets about 70 percent of the \npower consumed in Washington, subsequently put in place a rate increase \nof more than 40 percent in October 2001.\n  My State and region continue to struggle to pay power costs incurred \nduring the crisis, at least in part due to the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission's failure to act and void exorbitantly prices \ncontracts signed with the likes of Enron. And just this week I learned \nthat, as a result, the Northwest faces the prospect of yet another \nround of double-digit rate increases later this year.\n  Already, Washington State has suffered from the second or third \nhighest unemployment rate in the nature for almost a year. Already, \nutility disconnection rates have quadrupled in some areas of my State.\n  Already I receive letters from constituents who have to make the \nchoice between buying prescription drugs and paying their electricity \nbills. So my colleagues can imagine just what kind of threat further \nelectricity rate increases pose to the prospect of an economic \nrecovery.\n  I could recount in much more detail this administration's flagrant \ndisregard for the statutory requirement that consumers be charged \n``just and reasonable'' electricity rates. But today, I want to focus \non the fact it continues to ignore the plight of citizens who have \nborne the brunt of the economic crisis the administration itself had a \nhand in creating.\n  During fiscal year 2002, the Bush administration had at its disposal \na total of $600 million in LIHEAP contingency funds. Congress \nappropriated a total of $300 million of these funds as part of that \nyear's Labor-HHS appropriations bill; the remaining funds were \nappropriated as part of the fiscal year 2001 Supplemental bill, which \nincluded $300 million in LIHEAP funds that remain available until \nexpended.\n  Due to the dire economic circumstances in which many of my state's \nworking families find themselves, I have repeatedly asked this \nadministration to release a portion of those funds to Washington State.\n  In October 30, 2001, in testimony before the Senate Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pensions Committee, Assistant Health and Human \nService Secretary Wade Horn stated that LIHEAP fulfills a ``dual \nresponsibility to provide ongoing assistance where it is most needed \nand to respond to emergency situations such as extreme weather \nconditions, supply disruptions or price spikes.'' At the same time, he \nindicated that there were no plans to release emergency funds due to a \ndrop in fuel prices as well as forecasts of a relatively mild winter.\n  In response, I was joined by my colleague Senator Murray as well as \nsix other members of the Washington delegation in sending a December \n10, 2001 letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson, \npointing out that some 73 percent of Washington's low-income households \nare heated by electricity--rather than natural gas or oil, as in other \nparts of the country--and that retail rates continued to rise rapidly. \nI would also point out that since 1980--when LIHEAP was first \nauthorized--electricity prices have climbed 180 percent on a national \nbasis, while oil, natural gas and propane prices have been relatively \nmore stable. In light of all this, we requested an immediate release of \nthe then-$300 million in emergency LIHEAP money. no money was released.\n  On March 8,, 2002, after Congress had added another $300 million to \nthe LIHEAP contingency fund and Assistant Secretary Horn had, in his \nresponse to our first letter, suggested that should there be an \nemergency, the administration would release the necessary aid, I wrote \nagain to suggest we had reached that point.\n  Washington State's utility shutoff moratorium was set to expire, and \n5 inches of snow had just fallen in the eastern part of my State. Still \nno funds were released.\n  On April 12, 2002, I wrote yet another letter--this time to OMB \nDirector Mitch Daniels. After a phone call, he requested more \ninformation on Washington State's particular situation. My office \nprovided this information in an April 17, 2002 letter. Still no funds \nwere released.\n  On May 28, 2002, I joined with a number of my Senate colleagues from \nacross the country in sending a letter to President Bush, arguing that \nmany States had already exhausted their annual LIHEAP allocation. Still \nno funds were released.\n  Finally, on August 9, the administration released $100 million of the \ntotal $300 million available in fiscal year 2002 LIHEAP contingency \nfunds. Unfortunately, Washington State was not on the list to receive \nany of this additional money.\n\n[[Page S1203]]\n\n  What this amendment proposes to do is take the $300 million in \ncontingency LIHEAP funds Congress appropriated in fiscal year 2001 and \ndistribute it to this Nation's many families in need.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record and article from the \nDecember 22, 2002 New York Times, entitled ``The Legacy of Power Cost \nManipulation,'' which describes the situation in Snohomish County, WA.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Legacy of Power Cost Manipulation\n\n                           (By Timothy Egan)\n\n       Everett, Wash. Two years ago this month, a record was set \n     at the height of the West Coast energy crunch: an hour of \n     electric power was sold for $3,250--more than a hundred times \n     what the same small block had cost a year earlier.\n       Now, power supplies are abundant and wholesale prices have \n     plummeted. But the fallout from what state officials say was \n     the largest manipulation of the energy market in modern times \n     has continued to hit West Coast communities hard. Here in \n     Snohomish County, which has the highest energy rates in the \n     state, more than 14,000 customers have had their electricity \n     shut off for lack of payment this year--a 44 percent increase \n     over 2001. They have seen electric rate increases of 50 \n     percent, as the Snohomish County Public Utility District \n     struggles to pay for long-term power contracts it signed with \n     companies like Enron at the height of the price run-up.\n       Aided by charities, most customers have had their power \n     returned within a day of being shut off, but others are \n     forced to make choices about which necessities they can live \n     without.\n       It's a pretty tough thing trying to explain to your 5-year-\n     old kid why the lights won't come on anymore,'' said Crystal \n     Faye of Everett. ``I didn't pay much attention to all that \n     stuff about California and Enron, but it's certainly come \n     home to hurt us now.''\n       Ms. Faye and her husband, Rick, who are unemployed, have \n     had their power shut off twice this year.\n       Brianne Dorsey, a single mother, said she removed the \n     baseboard heater in her home here and has had to rely on a \n     small wood stove for heat, because she is $1,000 behind in \n     paying her electric bills.\n       Faced with such tales tied to rate increases along the West \n     Coast, states are trying to get back some of what they lost \n     during 18 months when energy prices seemed to have no \n     ceiling.\n       The decision this month by a federal regulatory judge that \n     California utilities had been overcharged by $1.8 billion \n     bolstered the case of Northwest utilities seeking refunds, \n     officials of those utilities said. It also angered California \n     officials, who say they will continue to press for a total of \n     nearly $9 billion in refunds. The Federal Energy Regulatory \n     Commission is expected to decide on Northwest refunds in the \n     spring.\n       No matter what the federal government decides, officials \n     say their best hope for compensation is from a number of \n     criminal investigations being pursued by Nevada and the three \n     West Coast states--Washington, Oregon and California. They \n     liken their cause to state lawsuits against tobacco \n     companies, which started as long shots but resulted in \n     enormous settlements.\n       Aided by a guilty plea in October from a former trader for \n     Enron, and by newly discovered internal documents describing \n     how companies manipulated the energy market in 2000 and 2001, \n     the West coast states are hoping to get settlement money from \n     more than a dozen energy trading companies.\n       The companies say they acted legally in taking advantage of \n     a unique market condition, but state officials say the \n     companies created a fake energy crisis.\n       At the height of the rise in energy costs in early 2001, \n     the Bush administration said the West Coast's troubles were a \n     precursor of what would happen if the nation did not build \n     1,900 power plants over the next 20 years.\n       But state officials in the hardest-hit areas say the crisis \n     was never about energy shortages so much as it was about an \n     epic transfer of wealth. They want payback--in some cases for \n     immediate relief to consumers who cannot pay their bills this \n     winter.\n       Last month, the Williams Company, in Tulsa, Okla., agreed \n     to a $417 million settlement with Washington, Oregon and \n     California. While admitting no wrongdoing, Williams agreed to \n     pay refunds and other restitution to the three states; in \n     return, the states dropped an antitrust investigation.\n       Among large energy companies, the states are seeking \n     refunds from the Mirant Corporation, Reliant Resources Inc., \n     Dynegy Inc., Duke Energy and Enron.\n       ``All of us on the West Coast have been hard hit by these \n     rate increases, but the poor in this county have just been \n     hammered,'' said Bill Beuscher, who runs the energy \n     assistance program in Snohomish County. Mr. Beuscher said \n     that in the first two weeks the winter energy assistance \n     program was open this year, requests for financial aid were \n     up 55 percent from the same period last year.\n       The power trading companies named in criminal \n     investigations and refund cases did not want to comment \n     publicly while the cases were pending. But several of the \n     companies that are fighting refunds have said in their public \n     filings that the utilities, particularly in the Northwest, \n     are trying to renege on legitimate long-term contracts. They \n     said they did not act in collusion and explained that the \n     highest prices were a result of severe market shifts brought \n     in part by the Northwest drought.\n       In some cases, the power trading companies said, the \n     utilities resisted buying shorter contracts, which would have \n     cost them less. They also said that some Northwest utilities \n     took advantage of the price spikes and sold power into the \n     market themselves, only to come up short later. The companies \n     said they expected to be vindicated when the government \n     finishes its refund cases next spring.\n       Mr. Beuscher said he would like to see money from the \n     Williams settlement be used to help people who cannot afford \n     the rate increases. Consumers in Oregon and California have \n     made similar pleas. But officials in all three states say \n     that until there are larger settlements with the energy \n     companies, consumers are unlikely to see relief.\n       ``We hope that the Williams case serves as a template,'' \n     said Tom Dresslar, a spokesman for the California attorney \n     genera's office, ``because California was monumentally ripped \n     off by these energy traders.''\n       About seven million consumers in California, who were \n     initially shielded from having to pay for runaway energy \n     costs during the worst part of the state's deregulation \n     debacle, are paying rate increases averaging 30 percent more \n     than the pre-deregulation prices of 1996. The state has the \n     highest energy rates in the nation, consumer advocates say, \n     although the structure of the rate increase allows poor \n     people and low energy users to escape the recent increases.\n       ``I don't hold out a lot of hope that we will ever get \n     significant refunds,'' said Doug Heller of the Foundation for \n     Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, a nonprofit group based in Los \n     Angeles. The group calculates that California power customers \n     overpaid a total of $70 billion.\n       At the height of the energy troubles, the trading companies \n     boasted of record profits in their quarterly reports. But \n     many of those companies are now near bankruptcy as they cope \n     with a downturn that has caused the energy trading sector to \n     lose 80 percent of its value, according to Wall Street \n     analysts.\n       ``It's like the highwayman robbed us and then spent all the \n     money on booze,'' Mr. Heller said.\n       The companies themselves blame the states. In one case that \n     was heard this month, William A. Wise, chief executive of the \n     El Paso Corporation, which is based in Houston, denied \n     manipulating the market and blames the officials who set up \n     California's deregulated energy market for causing the price \n     run-ups with ``one bad policy after another.''\n       Under a New Deal-era law, power companies can be forced to \n     pay refunds if they have charged an ``unreasonable and \n     unjust'' amount for electricity. The Federal Energy \n     Regulatory Commission, which West Coast governors say did \n     very little to restrain power traders during the height of \n     the run-ups, will determine the exact refund amount, if any.\n       In the meantime, electric rates throughout the Pacific \n     Northwest, once among the cheapest in the nation, have \n     climbed as much as 50 percent.\n       California's problems stem from its chaotic attempt at \n     energy deregulation, approved in 1996 and put in effect in \n     1998. The Northwest, with its tradition of publicly owned \n     utilities, was drawn into the California crisis by a \n     convergence of dry weather and freewheeling trading of its \n     own.\n       Usually, the Northwest avoids price fluctuations by \n     providing a steady stream of hydroelectric power, aided by \n     abundant winter rainfall. But in late 2000, a drought in the \n     Northwest forced utilities to buy power on the open market. \n     Some utilities had also tried to sell power into the \n     California market but were pinched by the drought.\n       At the same time, major energy traders were withholding \n     blocks of power to create the appearance of further \n     shortages, according to Enron memorandums discovered this \n     year.\n       Refunds were once thought to be unlikely. But then came the \n     memorandums--many of them detailing schemes to manipulate the \n     market under names like Death Star--and the agreement in \n     October by Timothy N. Belden, a former senior trader for \n     Enron, to plead guilty to conspiring with others to \n     manipulate the West Coast energy market.\n       Prosecutors say Mr. Belden is cooperating with \n     investigations of the power trading companies.\n       ``What really started the ball rolling were the smoking-gun \n     memos, and then the guilty plea has helped as well,'' said \n     Kevin Neely, a spokesman for the Oregon Department of \n     Justice.\n       There is also continued bitterness among West Coast \n     officials toward the Bush administration for waiting until \n     June 2001 before putting price controls on the market, which \n     immediately ended the large price spikes and rolling \n     blackouts and brought stability.\n       Since then, power use has fallen and prices on the short-\n     term market are about where they were before the energy run-\n     up of 2000 and 2001.\n       ``It was a fallacy to blame this crisis on a lack of new \n     power plants,'' said Steven Klein, superintendent of Tacoma, \n     Wash.'s public utility, Tacoma Power. ``But it's a shame what \n     came of this. It put a dent in a lot of family budgets, and \n     forced some businesses to close.''\n\n\n[[Page S1204]]\n\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, in part the article says:\n\n       Here in Snohomish County, which has the highest energy \n     rates in the state, more than 14,000 customers have had their \n     electricity shut off for lack of payment this year--a 44 \n     percent increase over 2001. They have seen electric rate \n     increases of 50 percent, as the Snohomish County Public \n     Utility District struggles to pay for long-term power \n     contracts it signed with companies like Enron at the height \n     of the price run-up . . .\n       ``It's a pretty tough thing trying to explain to your 5-\n     year old kid why the lights won't come on anymore,'' said \n     Crystal Faye of Everett. ``I didn't pay much attention to all \n     that stuff about California and Enron, but it's certainly \n     come home to hurt us now.''\n       Ms. Faye and her husband, Rick, who are unemployed, have \n     had their power shut off twice this year.\n       Brianne Dorsey, a single mother, said she removed the \n     baseboard heater in home and has had to rely on a small wood \n     stove for heat, because she is $1,000 behind in paying her \n     electric bills . . .\n\n  Mr. President, this article details but two examples of the plight of \nfar too many Washington state citizens--where an estimated 295,000 \nhouseholds were eligible for LIHEAP even before the Western energy \ncrisis and economic downturn collided to exact such a devastating toll. \nIn 2002, while the Bush administration sat idly by, some 80 percent of \nWashington State's eligible households received no LIHEAP assistance \nwhatsoever.\n  Of the 20 percent that did, 74 percent had children in the home, 14 \npercent of these households included disabled Americans, and 10 percent \nincluded the elderly.\n  The amendment before us today sends a clear message: while the Bush \nadministration has turned a blind eye to the very real economic pain \nbeing felt by our Nation's most vulnerable citizens--in my State, a \npain exacerbated by a very real energy emergency with its roots in the \nwestern electricity crisis--this Congress must not turn its back. This \namendment would ensure that an additional 11,000 households in \nWashington State, and many more through the Nation, would receive much-\nneeded assistance in keeping the lights and the heat turned on. I ask \nmy colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nRockefeller be added to the amendment as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER Mr. (Ensign) Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REED. I thank the Chair. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I believe we are in a position to enter \ninto a unanimous consent agreement relative to the Dodd amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the pending Dodd amendment be \ntemporarily set aside and that I be recognized in order to offer a \nfirst-degree amendment relating to the same subject matter; provided \nthat there be 60 minutes of total debate to be equally divided between \nSenator Gregg and Senator Dodd or their designees; provided, further, \nthat following the use or yielding back of time, the amendments be \ntemporarily set aside, with no amendments in order to either amendment \nprior to the vote; finally, I ask unanimous consent that when the \nSenate votes in relation to these amendments, the first vote in order \nbe in relation to the Gregg amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, we know the \nSenator is acting in good faith. We don't have a copy of this \namendment. We have a pretty good idea of what it is. We are confident \nthat we have a general understanding of the amendment. We believe this \nwould be appropriate.\n  We hope, when this debate is completed, that Senator Dayton will have \nan opportunity to offer his amendment. He is scheduled to be here at 1 \no'clock. Senator Inhofe is also here. But let us take one step at a \ntime. Therefore, we have no objection. Let me also say that debate on \nthis may not all be completed this afternoon. Senator Dodd would \nreserve whatever time is left of his 30 minutes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 78\n\n(Purpose: To provide additional funding for special education programs)\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, Senator Dodd has offered an amendment which \nincreases special education funding by $1.5 billion. As an individual \nwho has spent a tremendous amount of time, after being elected to this \nSenate, trying to bring special education funding in line with what the \nobligation of the Federal Government is supposed to be pursuant to the \n1976 bill, I like the idea of increasing special education funding and, \nin fact, have driven the effort here in the Senate for many years to \ntry to do exactly that, increase special education funding.\n  When special education was originally proposed, as has been \nmentioned, the understanding was that the Federal Government would pay \nabout 40 percent of the cost. Unfortunately, when I was first elected \nto Congress, the Federal Government was only paying about 6 percent of \nthe cost of special education. But I think it is important to review \nthe history to determine where we are and how we have gotten there \nrelative to increases in special education funding because the \nincreases have been rather dramatic over the last few years. In fact, \nas a result of the commitment of the Republican Senate, when we had \ncontrol of the Senate back in the 1990s--and now with President Bush--\nwe are seeing the most significant increases in special education \nfunding in the history of the program. Special education funding, as a \nfunction of the Federal Government, has increased faster than any other \nfunding element within the Federal Government on a percentage basis.\n  So let's review the history.\n  When the Republicans took control of the Senate in 1996, we made S. 1 \nthe first bill introduced by the new Republican Senate. S. 1 called for \nsignificant increases in special education funding. As a result, we \nhave dramatically increased special education funding every year. That \nis as a result of the Congress's effort, and now the President's \neffort, to the point where we are up to, this year, $7.5 billion in \n2002. It will be $8.5 billion in 2003. It will be $9.5 billion in 2004 \nif we follow the President's proposals.\n  This is an important factor because this funding commitment was made \nby the Republican Congress, not by the prior administration. During \nPresident Clinton's term in office, his proposed special education \nbudget increases were essentially nonexistent.\n  In the year 1997, he proposed a $280 million increase. In the year \n1998, he proposed a $139 million increase. In the year 1999, he \nproposed a zero increase in special education funding. In the year \n2000, he proposed a zero increase in special education funding. But \nduring this exact period, special education funding went up, as I \nmentioned, rather dramatically. Why? Because the Republican Members of \nthe Senate insisted upon it. We put it in our budget resolutions. We \npassed it out of our budget resolutions. And as a result, we \ndramatically increased funding in the special education accounts. There \nhas been a 224-percent increase in special education funding since \n1996.\n  Then President Bush came into office. And to show the difference in \npriorities from one administration to another administration, to show \nthe importance----\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator send his amendment to the \ndesk?\n  Mr. GREGG. I am going to send it up in a little while, Mr. President.\n  To show the difference in its importance in the two different \nadministrations and the impact it has on the special education \ncommunity in America, when President Bush came into office he did not \nsuggest a zero increase, as President Clinton had in 1999. In the year \n2000, he suggested a $1 billion increase. That $1 billion increase was \nin his first budget. He followed it up with another $1 billion increase \nin his second budget. So now he was up $2 billion. And then, in the \nyear 2003, he has added another $1 billion increase. So he is now up $3 \nbillion in 3 years, which is a 30-percent increase in just 3 years--\njust in 3 years--over the funding baseline of special education.\n\n[[Page S1205]]\n\n  So the commitment from this administration has been there and at a \nlevel which is historic and has had a dramatic impact in the funding \nneeds of the special education children of America.\n  The practical implication is that the Federal Government's role has \nnow gone from about a 6-percent commitment to special education to \naround 20 percent. It is a huge increase, a dramatic increase, and it \nis on a rising path to full funding if we can get the cost of special \neducation under control, which brings me to the second point.\n  We are now in the process of trying to reauthorize the special \neducation bill within the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee. There are a lot of issues involving special education that \ndo not involve funding; issues such as discipline, in which the Senator \nfrom Alabama has been involved; issues such as excessive regulation; \nissues such as too many consultants, too many lawyers taking money out \nof the system instead of having it go to the kids.\n  The fact is that the system has become convoluted, officious, and \nbureaucratic. It needs to be adjusted, and it needs to be improved so \nwe are getting the money back to the children who need the assistance \nas special needs children.\n  So reauthorization is very important in this whole context of what we \ndo. It is really difficult to continue to put money into the program at \nthese huge increased rates without doing reauthorization. Why is that? \nBecause it is like the goalposts keep moving every year.\n  We have seen, unfortunately, in some areas excessive coding, where \nkids who should not end up with the stigma of special needs end up \nbeing stigmatized as special needs children simply because the school \nsystem wants to get more money out of the special education accounts. \nThat is not right and not appropriate, and it undermines the ability to \nhelp the kids who really need the assistance.\n  So we need to reauthorize this bill to get some controls back in \nplace over how many children really are special needs children and make \nsure those kids who really are special needs children get the \nassistance they need, which brings us back to this amendment.\n  This amendment is well intentioned. I am in favor, as I have said \nbefore on this floor, of doing proper prioritization, of saying: What \nis it the Federal Government should be doing today? In what areas \nshould the Federal Government be putting its resources?\n  The No. 1 area, obviously, is fighting terrorism, protecting the \nhomeland, of making an aggressive effort in this area. Certainly the \nSenator from Maryland, who is seeking the floor, has been a leader in \nthis effort. But the fact is, after we get into dealing with terrorism, \nthe next area that I think is most important is education. I think the \nFederal commitment to education is critical. That is why I was a strong \nsupporter, last week, of an amendment which came to the floor which \nsaid we are going to put $5 billion more into education, No Child Left \nBehind proposals, title I, but in doing that we have to be willing to \nprioritize. We have to be willing to recognize that this country--our \nFederal Government--is now spending more than it is taking in. We have \nto be willing to set a ceiling as to how much we can afford to spend \nand then live within that ceiling.\n  But within that ceiling we need to make priorities back and forth \nbetween what are the right programs, what programs should get more \nmoney, what programs should get less money. We did that last week when \nwe adopted the amendment which said we are going to increase title I \nfunding, funding for the education of low-income kids, by $5 billion \nbut, in exchange for that, we are going to make an across-the-board \ncut.\n  The Senator from Connecticut has come forward with this amendment to \njump, by another $1.5 billion, the funding that is already going into \nspecial education. I am supportive of that, but, in the context of \nallocating resources fairly, of saying, if we are going to make that \ntype of decision, that is a priority, and we have to reduce somewhere \nelse.\n  So what I am offering today, and what I will send to the desk, at the \nrequest of the Presiding Officer, is an amendment which says, let's put \nin the $1.5 billion in special education, but also have a cut across \nthe board so we stay within this $750 billion number, which is the \namount of money which we have all agreed to pretty much is a reasonable \nnumber to spend as the Federal Government in the year 2003.\n  This $750 billion was not pulled out of a hat. It was aggressively \nnegotiated between both sides of the aisle and the White House. Prior \nto the Republicans taking back the Senate, it was actually agreed to as \nthe number we would reach in a bipartisan way. Now it seems to be \neroding with some of the amendments that are being brought forward. But \nas a practical matter, it is the right number for us, as a Congress, to \nsay: This is what we can afford to spend in the year 2003. But that \ndoes not mean that within that $750 billion we cannot make different \npriorities on the floor of the Senate. I happen to think one of those \npriorities should be special education.\n  Mr. President, I send to the desk an amendment and ask that it be \nreported.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Gregg] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 78.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place add the following:\n\n     ``SEC.   . FUNDING FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES \n                   EDUCATION ACT.\n\n       In addition to any amounts otherwise appropriated under \n     this Act for support of the Individuals with Disabilities \n     Education Act, the following sum is appropriated out of any \n     money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated for this \n     fiscal year ending September 30, 2003, $1,500,000,000, which \n     is to remain available through September 30, 2004; Provided, \n     That, unless there is a separate and specific offset for any \n     amounts that are appropriated under Title III of Division G \n     for support of special education in excess of $9,691,424,000 \n     for the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, the \n     percentage amount of any across-the-board rescission provided \n     under section 601 of Division N of this Act shall be \n     increased by the percentage amount necessary to rescind an \n     amount of funds equal to the total amounts appropriated in \n     excess of $9,691,424,000 for special education in Title III \n     of Division G.''\n\n  Mr. GREGG. This amendment is very simple. It says, let's set the \npriorities of special education. Let's add, on top of the $1 billion \nthe President is putting in this year, which is on top of $1 billion he \nput in last year, which was on top of $1 billion he put in the year \nbefore, another $1.5 billion, but let's be responsible about it. Let's \ntake the money out of the other accounts, which represents a four-\ntenths of 1 percent cut across the board on everybody, a very small \nnumber, very doable, and let's do a responsible amendment here on \nspecial education and take the increase of $1.5 billion and, in \nexchange for getting that increase in special education, make the \nacross-the-board cut.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am happy to yield whatever time the \nSenator from Maryland needs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. President, I rise as a proud cosponsor of the Dodd amendment \nwhich I believe is a first step to full funding for IDEA in 6 years. \nThe President has requested a billion dollar increase for IDEA. That \nmight sound like a lot, but at that rate, it will take 32 years to get \nfull funding for IDEA.\n  The administration is proposing tax breaks for zillionaires, and I \nbelieve that is a misplaced priority. We don't need tax breaks for \nthose who do not need help while we are delaying help for those who \nneed it the most--the children with special needs, their parents, and \nthe teachers of the school system that wants to support them and make \nsure they have the right educational program.\n  It is so disappointing that the Federal Government is not looking out \nfor the day-to-day needs of the American people. The Dodd amendment \nincreases IDEA by $1.5 billion. That is a total of\n\n[[Page S1206]]\n\n$10 billion, $2.5 billion more than last year. Under the Dodd program, \nif we followed that approach, we could fully fund IDEA in 6 years. What \na great way to get to the first decade of this new century.\n  The Federal Government is supposed to pay 40 percent of the cost of \neducating children with disabilities, yet it has never paid more than \n16 percent. That means local school districts have to make up the \ndifference, often by cutting educational programs or raising taxes. \nEither one of those are unacceptable options. Full funding for special \neducation will give local governments the resources they need to \nimprove education for all children.\n  Everywhere I go in my home State, I hear about IDEA. I hear about it \nregardless of the community, from the rural communities, whether it is \nthe mountain counties or the Eastern Shore, whether it is the suburban \ncounties which at first blush seem very prosperous and certainly my own \nBaltimore city, from Democrats and Republicans, from fiscal \nconservatives to social activists, they all talk about how the Federal \nGovernment is not living up to its promise about special education. In \nMaryland, on average, we get only 10 percent. Schools are suffering and \nparents are worried.\n  If you talk to parents, they are under a lot of stress, sometimes \nworking two jobs just to make ends meet, trying to find daycare for \ntheir kids or elder care for their parents. The Federal Government \nshould not add to their worries by not living up to its obligations. If \nyou have a special needs child with a chronic condition, whether it is \nasthma or autism or Down's syndrome or juvenile diabetes, you have \nsignificant stress in your family.\n  One of the ways to alleviate that stress is to make sure they have an \neducational program they can count on and a local school system that \nwill be able to work to meet those needs. Parents have real questions \nin their minds. Will they have adequate teachers? Will they have up-to-\ndate textbooks or technology? Will they be learning what they really \nneed to know? Parents of disabled children face a tough burden already. \nCaring for a disabled child at any age can be exhausting. Just think \nabout what they have to do to pay for their prescription drugs, if you \nare a juvenile diabetic. The federal government should not make it any \nharder, particularly when the laws are already on the book to guarantee \ntheir child an adequate education.\n  The bottom line is, the Federal Government is shortchanging parents, \nchildren, and local school districts. By providing $1.5 billion more \nthan what is already in the legislation, we can fully fund this by \n2009, freeing up money in local budgets for hiring more teachers, \ntextbooks, technology that would help schools improve education for all \nchildren.\n\n  This will help children with disabilities and their families by \nproviding enough money. More money means parents have to worry less. \nFull funding of IDEA is essential. We don't like being the Federal \nnanny. We don't like being the Federal schoolmarm. This is not about a \nnew program with a new bureaucracy and new regs and new mandates. This \nis about living up to our promise, the promise to the children, the \npromise to their parents, and the promise to the local community that \nwe will meet our responsibility if we give an obligation to a school \ndistrict.\n  I think the Dodd amendment is a terrific idea, and I want to support \nit.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire also says we need to take a look at \nspecial education--no two ways about it. In my home State, there is a \ndisproportionate number of African-American young men and Latino young \nmen being placed into special education. Is it the right place or is it \nthe wrong assessment? I don't know. But what I do know is there are \nchallenges to the legislation that we need to address, new thinking for \na new century, particularly with new technology breakthroughs.\n  If you are a mom or a dad, you are exhausted from meeting your family \nneeds, and the least we can do is help bear the financial cost while \nthey are coming out with what is the best plan and sharing the \nemotional responsibility, the family responsibility. It is time we have \nsome Federal responsibility.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, for some years now I have been active in \nthe debate over the Individuals with Disabilities Act. It is a program \nthat has provided tremendous benefit to thousands of families. Children \nget extraordinary care with the most severe disabilities in our public \nschools. At one hearing in the Education Committee, the superintendent \nfrom a school system in Vermont stated that 20 percent of his budget \ngoes to IDEA.\n  We have a serious problem with discipline. I have offered amendments \nand this Senate has passed amendments to deal with that discipline, the \nweaknesses in the IDEA act allowing a child whose misbehavior is \nunconnected in any way to the disability that they may have to be \ntreated quite differently from the other kids in the schools, making \nteachers and principals extremely upset and frustrated, knowing they \nhave a dual standard of behavior in their school systems.\n  I suggest to anybody that they talk to principals and teachers and \nsuperintendents who run school systems. They will tell you this act \nneeds to be reformed.\n  It is, in fact, a Federal mandate. It is a requirement on State \nsystems mandated by the Federal Government. It is time for us to do our \nshare of fixing the funding of it. I don't disagree with that. We need \nto get that 40 percent, as Senator Dodd indicated, paid. We need to \nhonor that commitment when they started this Federal regulation. But we \nalso need to reform the law. It has resulted in extraordinary lawsuits, \nbizarre results in the classroom and a trend of teachers leaving the \nsystem. A poll in Washington State indicated that 50 percent of special \neducation teachers expected not to be in the profession in 5 years.\n  We don't get reform here very often. We need to couch the huge \nincrease that is due to this program as part of a reform of IDEA. It is \nup for reauthorization this year. We are talking about it, working on \nit. I hope we can bring some real reform to the program. But we agree \nas a Congress on a $750 billion budget limit. We agreed on that, and it \nis easier to cast those political votes--one more vote in favor of one \nmore spending program outside the budget agreement that we had--just \nspend, spend, spend. Then we wonder why we didn't stick to our agreed \nlimit, why we have deficits.\n\n  The education budget went up significantly this year--about 10 \npercent. It has been going up significantly in the last 3 years. We are \nspending a large amount of money, and more each year, on education at a \nlevel probably three or four times the inflation rate. So, to the \ncontrary, we are spending money on education.\n  I think Senator Gregg's amendment is precisely correct. His amendment \nsays let's put the money in the area of education the Federal \nGovernment dominates, the area that in effect the Federal Government \nhas taken over--the regulations that direct schoolteachers and \nprincipals and superintendents and board members to run their schools \nin certain ways. Dealing with disabilities is a Federal regulation. We \nought to at least meet the 40-percent promise we made in 1975. So I \nthink the perfect solution to this, as Senator Gregg said, is let's \ntake the overall education budget, which has large increases throughout \nthat system--let's take that $1.5 billion from those other programs \nthat have received increases, shift it to the IDEA program, and give \nthem a bigger boost than we have. I really believe that is the right \nthing to do.\n  Mr. President, is my time up?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 40 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I have visited 30 or more schools in my \nState in the last 3 years. I have talked to teachers and principals on \na regular basis, and they express their frustration to me on this \nsubject. As Senator Mikulski indicated, she is hearing that and other \nSenators around the country have said the same thing to me. One \nexperienced special education teacher told me: Jeff, the problem is, we \nare here working on rules and regulations, lawsuits, and that sort of \nthing, and we\n\n[[Page S1207]]\n\nhave completely forgotten what is in the best interest of the child. We \nneed to reform this act. We need to get more money for it and improve \nwhat we are doing so that we help children more than based on the money \nwe now have.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, how much time remains under the amendment of \nthe Senator from Connecticut?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 34 minutes, 45 seconds.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I will take 10 minutes. Will the Senator \nnotify me when that is up?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will do so.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I want to express some thoughts. I thank my \ncolleagues for, once again, reconfirming support for the special \neducation program. That is heartening. As the Senator from Maryland \npointed out, of course, if we follow the plan of the present occupant \nof the White House, we will be talking about three decades more--we \nwill have to wait a longer time than we have waited to complete the 40-\npercent requirement that we have already endured.\n  So if you are a mayor or a county executive or a Governor, you can \ntake real heart in the fact that for about the next three decades we \nwill be at this debate on getting full funding--if we rely on the \nadministration's plans.\n  I will remind my colleagues once again that this body and the \nprevious Congress voted unanimously for a full funding program over the \nnext 6 years for special education. It was the administration--the \npresent administration--and the leadership of the other body--the \nRepublican leadership--that killed the proposal the Senate unanimously \nsupported. That is where we are. Those are the facts as we find them \ntoday. We can go back and revisit history if you want, but the fact is \nthat the Governors and mayors out there may find a history lesson \ninteresting, but they want to know what we are going to do. What is \nthis administration going to do? What has this administration done? \nWhat is the Republican leadership in the Senate and House going to have \nto do if we are going to meet the obligations we talk about?\n  So what we have here--as the Senator from New Hampshire suggests he \nwill support--is the $1.5 billion. He is going to do so by adding \nfurther to the across-the-board cuts in domestic spending--adding to \nthe impact of the already 2.9 percent across-the-board cuts. I will \nshare with my colleagues what this means.\n\n  Now, $1.5 billion is not a huge amount as a percentage--whatever it \nis, four-tenths of 1 percent. Add that, if you will, to the 2.9. The \nWIC Program will be cut by $137 million as a result of the 2.9-percent \ncut. The Food Safety Inspection Service will be cut by $22 million. The \nFood and Drug Administration will be cut by $40 million under these \nproposals. State-Justice-Commerce will be cut by $113 million in \nspending.\n  Go down to Head Start. This analysis shows what the 2.9-percent cut \nmeans in energy and water issues--there it is, a $239 million cut; \nenvironmental management, $203 million. There is a whole list of \nprograms, including the Bureau of Reclamation and the Mississippi River \nTributaries Program. If you look at Head Start, $63 million will be \ncut. Air traffic control--that ought to be good news for those who \nworry about domestic terrorism; transportation security, Coast Guard \nwill be cut by $72 million. The VA-HUD--veterans take note--has $903 \nmillion in cuts; VA medical care, $692 million in cuts. So go ahead and \nadd four-tenths of 1 percent to the already 2.9.\n  I don't hear anybody talking about a slight cut in the $670 billion \ntax cut in all we are proposing here. Then my colleagues say we will \ntake your $1.5 billion, but we are going to give a ``haircut'' to every \nother domestic spending program except the tax cut, which goes to the \ntop 1 or 2 percent of income earners. I represent a State that has \nprobably a greater percentage of those income earners than almost any \nother State in the country. I can say with certainty that my \nconstituents--those included, by the way--who would be the \nbeneficiaries of this tax cut would tell you that at this particular \njuncture that kind of a tax cut, given the fiscal needs of this \ncountry, is unwise.\n  When my colleagues say we are going to make everybody pay a price, we \nare going to make that haircut of 2.9 percent, including the budget \ncuts I have suggested, and add this to it, just make sure you \nunderstand what we are talking about. We are not talking about a tax \ncut which taxes revenues over the table--I am not suggesting there \nisn't room for a tax cut. But how about including that in the proposal? \nWhy is that particular area always left out and all we talk about are \nthe domestic programs that affect families so strongly?\n  I guarantee you, by the way, as you start looking at Head Start, the \nWIC Program, food safety programs, while you are providing $1.5 billion \nin special education needs and simultaneously cutting back on these \nother programs, it is not uncommon for the same family and the same \nchild to be the recipient on one hand of the 1.5, and simultaneously \ngetting food in the WIC Program, food safety programs, and the Head \nStart programs.\n  Again, I don't know how you can sit here and look at a child who has \nautism or is suffering from juvenile diabetes, Down's Syndrome, or \nother special education needs and say: I am sorry we cannot touch the \ntax cuts, but you are going to have to take this cut in other areas. \nWhen my colleagues offer their side-by-side amendment and suggest yet \nfurther cuts, I think that is cruel. I think it is unnecessary. I think \nthere are ways of doing this without going after some of these very \nissues that are so critically important to the well-being of our \nNation. They have a lot to do with the economic security of our country \nas well.\n  We need to have a balanced approach. So, Mr. President, we will have \na debate further along in this year on full funding again. I only hope \nthe administration changes its view from the last Congress. I will \nreiterate what I said earlier. Governors and mayors list this as their \ntop priority. Mr. Governor or Mr. Mayor, when the first amendment is \nvoted on and we are telling you, by the way, we are going to help you \nout in special education, hold your breath because we are \nsimultaneously reaching into your other pocket and causing you to raise \ntaxes or cut other vital spending needs you may have because we are \nreaching in to rob you of the necessary resources you need as well to \nrun your States and your communities. It is a cruel hoax, in a way, we \nare laying out before people.\n  I am not opposed to looking at reform efforts. We had a fine effort \nin 1997--some of my colleagues have forgotten this already--to look at \nthe special education programs. Again, with the reauthorization, I \npresume we will look at them again. I certainly welcome that. Anytime \nwe have a program such as IDEA, close examination of how well it is \nworking, whether or not the intended beneficiaries are receiving the \nresources they need, is something we ought to do. It is the only \nresponsible thing to do.\n  Let's not simultaneously suggest that we are going to have to wait \nfor examination before we provide the resources to the States and \ncommunities. They do not have a chance of waiting. They have to provide \nfor these children under existing law. Congress mandated it 28 years \nago, and we have only gotten to 15, 16 percent of that 40-percent \ncommitment.\n  The $1.5 billion in this amendment gets us a little closer to the 40-\npercent commitment. It raises and provides the resources to these \ncommunities for the fiscal year we are in already. We will come back \nagain later in this Congress to see if we can get full funding set up \nin a way which we did a year and a half ago.\n  When the vote occurs on this amendment, there are two options: One, \nto provide the $1.5 billion while going after domestic spending \nprograms, along the lines I mentioned already or, second, we can say we \ncan do it and find the means of doing it, and one of the means is to \nreduce by a small amount the tax cut the President intends to provide \nfor people in the country. The point being that most of the recipients \nof this tax cut are people who have incomes in excess of $250,000.\n  Tell that to a family with an autistic child. Tell that to a family \nwith a child who has Down syndrome or serious learning disabilities: \nSorry, we would like to provide that kind of help you need, but, you \nsee, we have an obligation to provide a tax break to someone making \n$300,000, $400,000 a year. We cannot just quite meet the obligation\n\n[[Page S1208]]\n\nto you. I know we made a promise to do it. We said 28 years ago we \nwould do it. We are up to 15 percent of that obligation. By the way, if \nyou wait another 33 years, we will complete that obligation, 60 years \nafter we made the promise. Then we will get you your resources because \nwe cannot afford to give you the help you need without cutting \neverything else in the domestic area. Of course, we cannot touch the \ntax cut for the most affluent Americans.\n  I do not know of anyone outside the people in this town who believe \nin the logic of that argument. Nonetheless, watch and see what happens \nwhen we vote on this amendment. That is exactly what will happen. Go \nhome and explain why we have to cut into these other areas to serve \nneedy kids in this country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used his 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I will take 1 additional minute. I repeat \nwhat I said earlier, this is not the America of which people think. We \nare blessed with great resources. We ought to have the common sense to \nfind a balance, to see to it we meet our obligations when we make them; \nthat we try to help those who are least able to help themselves and \ntheir families.\n  I underscore the point the Senator from Maryland made a few moments \nago. Families of children with special needs face incredible pressures, \nespecially those making $25,000, $30,000, $35,000, $40,000, $45,000, \n$60,000. There are incredible pressures within that family. Why is it \nwe cannot find the resources to help our States, our Governors, our \ncounty executives to do more to help these children?\n  Reforming the process, I am all for that. But the only way we can \nhelp is to go after the WIC Program, the Head Start Program, food \nsafety programs, and the like? That I do not understand, and I defy my \ncolleagues to ask an average American to explain it as well. They do \nnot understand it when they hear that argument or we are going to wait \nanother 33 years to meet the obligations under this program.\n  I feel passionately about this issue; I care deeply about this issue \nbecause it is the role that Government ought to play. When I look at \nfamilies in my State and across the country--and I know the pressures \nthey are feeling and what a small amount it is to offer some relief--\njust some relief--to the families feeling this heat and pressure, the \nanxiety it causes--I do not understand that we cannot step up and meet \nthe obligation because we cannot touch a tax cut that goes to the most \naffluent citizens of this country. I do not understand that situation. \nI hope my colleagues do not either. When the vote occurs tomorrow, I \nhope we will support the amendment that provides assistance but does \nnot do so off the backs of people who can least afford it in the \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this has been cleared with the majority. I \nask unanimous consent that the consent request with respect to the \nEdwards amendment be modified to the Senate resuming consideration of \nthe amendment at 2:15 p.m., with the previous provision still \napplicable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senator from Connecticut has reserved \nhis time, as has the Senator from New Hampshire. I am going to suggest \nthe absence of a quorum and, shortly thereafter, call it off with hopes \nwe can move to the Dayton amendment and set aside the pending \namendments.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada does not control the \ntime.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time that \nSenator Gregg and Senator Dodd have remaining be preserved and the \nquorum call, which I will make immediately, not be charged to their \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my friend from Wyoming is here and wishes to \nspeak on the Edwards amendment. Under the order we just entered, that \nis not to recur until 2:15 p.m. If the Senator wishes to speak, we can \ntake him out of order, if Senator Dayton is willing to wait 10 minutes \nwhile the Senator from Wyoming speaks.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I, therefore, ask unanimous consent that the \npending amendment be set aside; that Senator Dayton be recognized to \noffer an amendment on corporate expatriation; and that following his \nrecognition, Senator Thomas be recognized for 10 minutes to speak on \nthe Edwards amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend, if he will simply seek \nrecognition and send his amendment to the desk, then Senator Thomas \nwill be recognized to speak for 10 minutes.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 80\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 80.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Dayton] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 80.\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-\n296) to provide that waivers of certain prohibitions on contracts with \n corporate expatriates shall apply only if the waiver is essential to \n             the national security, and for other purposes)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC __. CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the \n     ``Senator Paul Wellstone Corporate Patriotism Act of 2003''.\n       (b) Limitation on Waivers.--Section 835 of the Homeland \n     Security Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-296) is amended by \n     striking subsection (d) and inserting the following:\n       ``(d) Waivers.--The President may waive subsection (a) with \n     respect to any specific contract if the President certifies \n     to Congress that the waiver is essential to the national \n     security.''.\n       (c) Expanded Coverage of Entities.--Section 835(a) of such \n     Act is amended by inserting ``nor any directly or indirectly \n     held subsidiary of such entity'' after ``subsection (b)''.\n       (d) Section 835(b)(1) of such act is amended by inserting \n     ``before, on, or'' after ``completes.''\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 67\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. I rise to talk for a few minutes about an amendment that \nis pending. It has to do with the New Source Review rider. It is an \namendment which would, in effect, negate or postpone a proposed change \nin rules that have been proposed by the administration that I think are \nvery important to our efforts collectively to increase the more \neffective production of electricity and energy, and to do it in a way \nthat contributes to clean air. I believe this New Source Review \nproposal does that.\n  The Senator from North Carolina has an amendment which would prevent \nthe final rules from taking place. He indicates that, in his view, it \nwould prevent backsliding from the administration. He also indicates he \nconsiders it an insider's industry benefit.\n  I suggest that neither of these allegations is valid. In fact, what \nis happening is a change that will remove the obstacles to \nenvironmentally beneficial projects, clarify the New Source Review \nrequirements, encourage emissions reductions, promote pollution \nprevention, provide incentives for energy efficiency improvements, and \nhelp assure worker and plant safety. Those are the things that are \ninvolved.\n  To some extent, I think this amendment has a little bit to do with \n2004 in that it is seen as the President's gift to polluters. Of \ncourse, that is not the case.\n  The proposed rider is premature and ignores the public involvement \nalready inherent in this New Source Review reform process. In December \nof 2002, the EPA issued a final rule that includes actions previously \nproposed by and\n\n[[Page S1209]]\n\nsubstantially similar to those put forward by the Clinton \nadministration. These actions are supported by a bipartisan consensus \nafter extensive public involvement over more than 10 years. A separate \nproposed rule on issues related to routine maintenance, repair, and \nreplacement will undergo a full public review and EPA analysis before \nit can take effect. Thus, it is clearly premature at this time to stop \nthis open rulemaking process by rider before the process even begins.\n  A proposed rider is bad energy and environmental policy. The \ncomplexity of the current New Source Review program and its related \nburdens create significant disincentives to new investment in energy-\nefficient and environmentally friendly technologies that are being \nproposed.\n  The NSR reforms should allow facilities where actual emissions remain \nwithin permitted levels to make operating adjustments and explore \nalternative fuel and resource choices that will help them meet energy \nand product needs in the most efficient, cost-effective, \nenvironmentally sound manner possible.\n  A proposed rider will negatively impact more than 22,000 industrial \nfacilities across the country. The New Source Review program affects \nutilities, refineries, and manufacturers around the country that form \nthe backbone of our Nation's economy. In the current economic climate, \nwe need sensible reforms that streamline regulatory programs while \nproviding fundamental environmental protection that allows companies to \nimprove energy efficiency, environmental performance, and economic \ncompetitiveness.\n  A proposed rider would impede a State's ability to implement \neffective clean air programs. The National Governors Association, the \nNational Conference of State Legislators, Environmental Council of the \nStates, and several State attorneys general have called for NSR reforms \nthat enhance the environment and increase energy security.\n\n  The keys to improving air quality and energy security are innovation \nand investment. The final and proposed NSR rules will help promote \nsafer, cleaner, and more efficient factories, refineries, and \npowerplants.\n  Many groups have supported the idea of making these kinds of changes. \nInterestingly enough, the National Black Chamber of Commerce has \nindicated in a letter the proposed revisions to the Clean Air Act's New \nSource Review previously provided a meaningful compromise to economic \ngrowth and the assurance of clean air and continued public health \nprotection.\n  Such an amendment that is now before us, they continue, impedes \nprogress in reforming a well-intended program that has, over the years, \nunintended consequences.\n  Another group which is a cooperative in Montana, with membership of \nover 325,000, says: We know many environmental groups oppose NSR \nreform, but NSR reform will actually move forward quicker in adopting \nmore modern and efficient environmental technologies and procedures.\n  These are some of the testimonies that say we ought to continue with \nthe proposal that has been made to allow refiners to be able to make \nimprovements on existing facilities that will improve the environment \nand will continue to provide for efficient energy production.\n  I urge that the amendment offered by the Senator from North Carolina \nnot be received by the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I ask unanimous consent that I be given 15 minutes to \nmake my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 80\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. President Bush's announced tax proposal expressed concern \nover the double taxation of corporate profits. I wish he would express \nan equal concern about the nontaxation of corporate profits.\n  It is estimated that currently less than half of corporate profits \nare taxed in this country. There are various tax and accounting \ngimmicks that have permitted very profitable companies to not only have \nno tax liabilities but even receive multimillion-dollar refunds from \nthe American taxpayers.\n  Take CSX, for example, which until recently has been headed by the \nPresident's nominee for Secretary of the Treasury, John Snow. In the \nlast 4 years, CSX reported U.S. profits of $934 billion, and they paid \nzero in U.S. corporate taxes. In fact, they received rebates of $164 \nbillion.\n  I will repeat that. They made $934 billion in U.S. profits, paid no \ntaxes, and received a $164 billion refund. That is certainly not double \ntaxation. That is not even single taxation. That is no taxation, and it \nis a bigger winner on Wall Street to inflate corporate profits at the \nexpense of the rest of American taxpayers. It is one of the reasons \ncorporate income tax has been a declining share of Federal tax revenues \nin the last 40 years. In 1960, corporations paid 23 percent of all \nFederal tax revenues. Last year, that dropped to 9.5 percent, less than \nhalf of the share that corporations paid 40 years ago.\n  It used to be the ethic that business, being an integral part of the \ncommunities in which they operated, drawing their lifeblood from the \nAmerican people and from the democratic and capitalist structures which \nhallmark this country, had an obligation to give something back. Not \nany longer.\n  An Ernst & Young partner recently noted:\n\n       A lot of companies feel that the improvement on earnings is \n     powerful enough that maybe the patriotism issue should take a \n     back seat.\n\n  One of the most outrageous and obscene tax avoidance schemes is many \nUnited States companies are setting up sham corporate headquarters \noffshore in places such as Bermuda or the Cayman Islands. These tax-\nfree havens permit the total avoidance of U.S. taxes on foreign \noperations and, in some cases, on domestic operations as well.\n  In the nonpartisan journal, Tax Notes, a recent calculation was made \nthat from 1983 to 1999 the profits that the largest 10,000 U.S. \ncorporations claimed to have earned in these tax havens increased by \nover 7 times. Today, that means well over $100 billion in corporate \nprofits are shifted each year from the United States to these tax-free \nhavens--no taxes paid on them and, as I have said before, sometimes \neven refunds. It is bad enough those companies can evade U.S. taxes but \nsome even continue to secure very large and lucrative contracts with \nthe Federal Government, even in the areas of national defense and \nhomeland security. Evidently these corporations--the executives who run \nthem, the boards that oversee them--see nothing wrong with profiting \noff of the U.S. Government and then avoiding paying taxes on even those \nprofits in order to support our Government.\n\n  That is why last summer my colleague, Senator Paul Wellstone, had \namended the 2002 Defense appropriations bill to bar such corporate tax \ndodgers from being awarded Government defense contracts. Then he \nsuccessfully had amended the homeland security bill to bar those \ncompanies from getting contracts with the new Department of Homeland \nSecurity. Both of those amendments passed the Senate seemingly \nunanimously on voice votes.\n  However, after the November election, and after Paul Wellstone's \ntragic death, the final version of the homeland security bill gutted \nthe Wellstone amendment. Senator Wellstone's amendment, which he \ncrafted with the cosponsorship of the distinguished Senator from \nNevada, Mr. Reid, provided a narrow exception to this prohibition. That \nwas if the President of the United States certified to Congress that it \nwould be necessary for our national security.\n  When the bill came back this provision was gutted and the \nsubstitution made known to those who had to vote on it that day. They \nstuck in language that would allow the Secretary of Homeland Security \nto grant waivers for national security or economic benefits. Just about \nany kind of economic benefit whatever could be waived and argued by the \nSecretary: preventing loss of Government, preventing the Government \nfrom incurring any additional costs, anything and everything that you \ncould contrive, you could avoid if you could pay a high-priced \nWashington lobbyist $1,000 an hour or more, euphemistically called \ngovernment relations. No doubt those waivers would be granted and the \nlegacy of my colleague, Senator Paul Wellstone,\n\n[[Page S1210]]\n\nwould be obliterated by waves of waivers, which is why we need more \nPaul Wellstones in Washington.\n  To honor Senator Wellstone's memory, I proposed this amendment, which \nI called the Senator Paul Wellstone corporate patriotism amendment. It \nreinstates the Wellstone language to the Homeland Security Act. It \nsays, once again, corporations that renounce their American citizenship \nand have moved offshore to avoid paying taxes to the U.S. Government \nwill not get business contracts from the Government, at least not for \nhomeland security projects.\n  My language makes it as forceful and explicit as possible. It states \nthat the President may waive subsection (A) of the prohibition if the \nPresident certifies the waiver is essential to national security.\n  Frankly, I cannot see any reason there should be waivers granted in \nthis section. That is the least we can do for the memory of Paul \nWellstone. That is the least we can do for our country.\n  Frankly, most U.S. corporations, as most American citizens, are law \nabiding, patriotic, responsible, and willing to do their job, including \npay taxes, to keep this country strong. No one likes paying taxes. \nAmericans have been antitaxation since colonial days, since the Boston \nTea Party, since the rallying cry, ``taxation without representation is \ntyranny.''\n\n  But taxes are necessary for our country's survival. We have increased \nour military spending by 23 percent in the last 2 years, with \nbipartisan support regarding the President's request, and we have new \nefforts underway in homeland security costing an additional $37 \nmillion. Some Members last week thought we should be spending even more \nin that area. We have Operation Enduring Freedom still underway in \nAfghanistan and a military buildup now for possible war against Iraq. \nThat has to be paid for with our tax dollars. It does not include \nhighways and airports, sewer water systems, public education, student \naid, health care, nursing homes. This always depends, again, on \nAmericans paying taxes. It ought to depend on everyone paying their \nfair share of taxes--individuals and corporations.\n  When someone avoids paying their fair share, then everyone else has \nto pay a higher share. When one corporation making profits can shift \nits profits overseas and avoid paying taxes, everyone else has to pick \nup that part.\n  I wish we could establish again in this country the ethic that tax \navoidance is unpatriotic. It is un-American, especially at a time such \nas this with national mobilization, especially in this country since \nSeptember 11 of 2001, which is likely to continue for the foreseeable \nfuture. If the executives and board members of these expatriated \ncompanies can so shamelessly abandon their U.S. corporate citizenship, \nmaybe they should forfeit their citizenship as well. I intend to \nintroduce legislation in the next few weeks that would require just \nthat. What is good for the goose is good for the gander. This tax \ncheating will destroy the great golden goose of America. We send our \nyoung men and women overseas to risk their lives or even give their \nlives for our country, while men--mostly men and a few women--send \ntheir corporations overseas to evade taxes. What a disgrace. What a \nshame that the greatness of this country is being undermined by placing \nprofits and corporate and individual greed over the best interests of \nthe United States of America.\n  This amendment meant a lot to my friend and colleague, Senator \nWellstone. He was surprised but delighted that the Senate, on two \noccasions, passed this amendment by a voice vote. Had Paul lived, I \nwould have enjoyed watching the fur fly that day in November when this \nbill came back to the Senate with this provision gutted. But Paul is \nnot here, so it is incumbent upon all of us to take that stand for him \nand with him. If it was good enough last year to be passed by the \nSenate, I cannot imagine why anyone who supported it then would change \ntheir mind now. In fact, there is even more reason than before to stand \nbehind America, stand behind the belief that we all contribute our \nshare, do our share, and no one avoids their share. That is what makes \nus successful.\n  Mr. REID. I would like to ask the Senator a question. I personally \nappreciate the Senator stepping forward. It should come from the State \nof Minnesota. Senator Wellstone believed in this strongly.\n  I remember the Senator advocating this. When I think of our friend \nPaul and his untimely death in the terrible airplane crash, I feel \nbadly. I feel good about your moving forward with this amendment that \nPaul and I worked on together in the Senate. It is a modest amendment.\n  The Senator recognizes, does he not, that this amendment does not \napply to nonhomeland security or defense contracts? Maybe we will do \nsomething about these companies later. I don't believe they should be \nable to have a contract with Health and Human Services, with the \nDepartment of the Interior, or any of the Federal agencies. However, we \nhave limited this amendment to homeland security and defense. Does the \nSenator acknowledge that?\n  Mr. DAYTON. The Senator is correct. The Senator was instrumental in \nworking with Senator Wellstone on the floor and myself to craft this \namendment. It is narrowly focused.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator would also acknowledge, would he not, that this \nis not a permanent ban. All they have to do is say let me do what I \nshould have done in the first place, just pay American taxes.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Come home.\n  Mr. REID. There are all kinds of reincorporations that take place \nevery day in corporate America. They could simply reincorporate in \nDelaware or Nevada or Minnesota or any place they felt appropriate and \nthey would be right back, being able to get all the contracts they \nwant.\n  Mr. DAYTON. They would be right back, as the Senator said, where they \nwere before, headquartered in the United States of America, paying \ntaxes on their U.S. profits rather than creating a sham. These are not \nreal entities; these are fictions just for the sake of tax evasion.\n  Mr. REID. My third inquiry to the Senator from Minnesota: I know some \nof our friends who are lobbyists, as you have indicated, public \nrelations representatives--I think, with a straight face they really \nwould have trouble advocating for this. Would the Senator acknowledge \nthat?\n  Mr. DAYTON. I would, also.\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate the Senator's attention.\n  Mr. President, tax loopholes allow dozens of U.S. corporations to \nmove their headquarters, but they move them on paper only, to tax haven \ncountries to avoid paying their fair share of U.S. taxes. It was just a \nshort time ago that Senator Wellstone and I offered an amendment to bar \nthe Department of Homeland Security from awarding Government contracts \nto these corporate tax runaways. The Senate adopted that amendment \nunanimously. But in the homeland security bill that passed the last \nlittle bit that we were here last year, they cut this amendment.\n  It is a sad reality that these corporate expatriations are \ntechnically legal under current law. But legal or not, there is no \nreason U.S. Government contracts should be awarded to these tax \nrunaways. These are lucrative Government contracts and we should not \nreward these companies for doing what they have done.\n  Senator Wellstone and I believed these corporations, if they want \nFederal contracts so badly, they should simply come home, come back to \nthe United States and be eligible to bid on homeland security \ncontracts. If they didn't want to do that, then they should go lobby, \nfor example, the Government of Canada or Bermuda or the Cayman Islands \nfor contracts there.\n  Some of these companies have indicated: We have been in business in \nAmerica for a long time. They should stay in business in America. These \ncorporations are shams. We have companies that file paperwork, set up \nnot one but sometimes more than one corporation. One company has three \nBritish employees in a little office in Hamilton, Bermuda, but by \nhaving these three individuals in Hamilton, Bermuda, they can avoid \npaying up to $40 million every year in U.S. income taxes.\n  This bill would forbid foreign corporations involved in these \ntransactions from holding Government contracts with the Defense \nDepartment and Department of Homeland Security. It would not restrict \nmajor corporations operating in the United States\n\n[[Page S1211]]\n\nfrom winning millions of dollars from the Government in contracts.\n  I am not going to pinpoint companies. I have read on the Senate floor \njust a few months ago the names of these companies that are doing these \nthings. This amendment will finally correct the record and accomplish \nwhat Senator Wellstone worked for last year. It should have been a \npriority in the legislation to guarantee the Department of Homeland \nSecurity booked its business with corporations that do their share of \nbearing the burdens of protecting this country. What they have done is \nthey are bearing the burden to protect their own companies, not their \nown country. The homeland security law is more concerned with window \ndressing on this issue because what is in the homeland security bill \nstill allows these companies to have huge Government contracts, \nhomeland security contracts.\n\n  One contract I have here, $144,844,000 is what they are getting, even \nthough they have incorporated in Bermuda.\n  Another company, not as large as the first, but almost $5 million. We \nhave another company, $6 million; $17 million; another company, $249 \nmillion; another company, $2 million; $248 million--it is on and on \nwith these what I would think would be embarrassing to them. Apparently \nit is not embarrassing enough that they pay corporate taxes in the \nUnited States like other companies.\n  I again extend my appreciation to the Senator from Minnesota for this \namendment and I hope the many people who are in favor of this \nlegislation will speak in favor of the legislation and we can have a \nresounding vote like we did when it passed unanimously last year. This \nwould be one way to honor the dignity of Paul Wellstone.\n  Mr. DAYTON. If I may inquire of my friend, the Senator from Nevada, \nregarding the last statement, can the Senator think of anything that \nwould be a better tribute to Senator Wellstone's memory than passing \nthis amendment and insisting the Senate conferees uphold it and the \nPresident sign it into law?\n  Mr. REID. I would answer my friend by saying Senator Wellstone, as we \nknow, stood for the small guy. He was concerned about those people who \ndid not have the large lobbying contracts. I think the Senator from \nMinnesota is absolutely right. The senior Senator from Minnesota is \nright in that this amendment would help a lot of the small people--\nsmall in stature, big in character, like Paul Wellstone--the people \nPaul Wellstone would try to protect. That is because people who are not \npaying these taxes prevent us from providing more money for LIHEAP, for \nwhich he advocated all the time. It would allow us to provide more \nmoney for education, which he talked about, and he could do that \nbecause he was a college professor. It would allow more money for the \nglobal AIDS epidemic that he talked about.\n  This money that these corporations are not paying is more money that \nother taxpayers have to come up with. We have expenses that have to be \nmet. We have programs that have to be funded. This amendment would \nforce some of these unpatriotic companies into being more patriotic. \nThey would be more patriotic because they would be forced to be more \npatriotic. If they want to have Government contracts with the Homeland \nSecurity Department and Homeland Defense Department, they would have to \nbe patriotic.\n  So I answer the question with a resounding yes. This would mean a lot \nto Paul Wellstone, that his legacy is not forgotten, nor the things for \nwhich he fought.\n  A lot of these things he fought for alone. I can remember this issue \nthat he was beaten up on pretty good on the Senate floor--until he was \nable to talk and explain. Like many of the things that Paul Wellstone \nbrought out of the dark into the light, in the light of day it all \nlooked better. I hope we all support this the way we did before.\n  This is an important amendment and I repeat, it would honor one of \nthe most courageous people I have ever known--physically and \nintellectually--Paul Wellstone.\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. The Senator is absolutely correct about the price we pay \nwhen these companies avoid their share of taxes. The Tax Notes journal \nestimated over $100 billion in corporate profits now go untaxed because \nof these offshore tax evasions. Even 20 percent, the tax rate on that, \nwhich is below the corporate rate but after deductions and exclusions \nprobably is close to what tax-paying corporations pay, that would cover \nthe cost of the 40-percent funding for special education that Senator \nDodd was discussing with Senator Gregg a few minutes ago. There it \nwould be right there. We could keep that promise to Minnesota's \nschoolchildren, Nevada's schoolchildren, and all the schoolchildren in \nthe school districts across this country. It would not require raising \nanybody's taxes by a single dollar, if those who were evading them \nwould pay their share.\n  I think it is shameful. I think it is un-American, unpatriotic, and \nit ought to be illegal. I particularly look forward to a discussion at \nsome point, as I said, about legislation I intend to introduce that \nsays if corporate executives and corporate boards are going to send \nthese corporations overseas, they should go overseas themselves. If \nthey think it is such an advantage to be in the Cayman Islands or \nBermuda they should go live there themselves. If they are going to \nrenounce their corporate citizenship, let them renounce their own \ncitizenship as well, and they will suffer the consequences maybe then \nthey will stop and think about how fortunate we are to live in this \ncountry and how it is only by all of us doing our fair share that this \ncountry keeps strong and secure.\n  Mr. REID. If I could respond to my colleague through the Chair, let \nme say the defense of this previously was that these are just good \nlawyers, good tax men. This is the way the law is written so why \nshouldn't they take advantage of it?\n  What the Senator from Minnesota and I are trying to do is change the \nlaw so that this is not this tax loophole. We know and people know that \nthere are lots of tax loopholes. They are hard to plug because of the \nhuge lobby which they have. We try to plug them. The ones that benefit \nare some of the largest corporations in America--I am sorry to say--\navoiding billions of dollars in taxes. It is not fair. They reply by \nsaying, well, these people have good lawyers and good accountants. That \ndoesn't justify what they are doing. In fact, it even signifies that we \nneed to do this as quickly as possible to stop these people from doing \nthis and make it easier for the rest of the people in America who are \npaying their fair share.\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. As the Senator knows, a lot of small- and medium-sized \nbusinesses don't have the options. Certainly the average American \ncitizen paying taxes doesn't have the option to move to Bermuda or the \nCayman Islands and not claim any tax liability whatsoever. It is \nshameful that those most profitable that can most easily afford to pay \ntheir share are avoiding them entirely and dumping that burden on \neveryone else.\n  As the Senator said, this would be one small step in the right \ndirection of returning to an ethic where those who are making profits \npay their taxes. If we all do that in a fair way, then everybody's \ntaxes go down. If somebody is avoiding taxes, then somebody else's \ntaxes go up.\n  I thank the Senator again for his support and assistance with this \nmatter. I know in this matter that Senator Paul Wellstone could not \nhave stood alone last year, and the Senator from Nevada was with him \nshoulder to shoulder every step of the way.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are waiting now until 2:30 when Senator \nInhofe is to appear. We understand he will close with the Edwards \namendment.\n  We want the Record to be spread with the fact that we have done \neverything we can to move this legislation along. We were ready to go \nearly this morning. We had to wait until the other side was ready to \nmove on the bill. We have done our best to plug all the timeslots that \nhave been in existence this morning. I want the Record to reflect that \nwe are doing nothing to slow this down.\n  I see Senator Inhofe is here now. If he is ready to speak, we could \nmove the 2:30 time up to whatever time is appropriate for the chairman \nof the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, if the minority leader will yield, I \nthought I would get to the floor at 2:15.\n\n[[Page S1212]]\n\n  Mr. REID. The Senator was scheduled for 2:30. We are ready now.\n  I am to be corrected. I was told by the floor staff that I was wrong \nand the Senator is right. It is 2:15. We don't need to change anything. \nWe ask unanimous consent to return to the Edwards amendment. I think \nthat is the order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 86 to Amendment No. 67\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, as many of you know, in March of 2001, \nSenator Breaux and I wrote the first congressional letter on the New \nSource Review Program to Vice President Cheney in his capacity at that \ntime as chairman of the National Energy Policy Development Group. Our \nletter stated that, unless reformed ``EPA's flawed and confusing NSR \npolicies will continue to interfere with our Nation's ability to meet \nour energy and fuel supply needs.''\n  At this point in my presentation, I ask unanimous consent to have \nthat letter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 23, 2001.\n     Hon. Richard B. Cheney,\n     Vice President of the United States of America, The White \n         House, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Vice President: In your capacity as the Chairman \n     of the National Energy Policy Development Group, we are \n     writing to bring to your attention our concerns that, unless \n     addressed, the prior administration's EPA's New Source Review \n     (``NSR'') enforcement policies will continue to interfere \n     with our nation's ability to meet our energy and fuel supply \n     needs. We strongly urge that the Administration take into \n     account these concerns in developing its national energy \n     plan.\n       As you are very much aware, the nation faces a potential \n     energy supply shortage of significant dimension. The \n     California energy crisis is receiving the greatest attention \n     in the media. However, major challenges exist in meeting \n     demands for gasoline and other fuels, especially in the \n     Midwest. More troubling, current projections suggest fuel \n     shortages and price spikes--far exceeding last year's \n     problem. These are due to a number of factors including: \n     difficulties in making summer-blend Phase II reformulated \n     gasoline; EPA hurdles to expanding refinery capacity; and the \n     overall increase in energy demand.\n       Unless reviewed and addressed, EPA's implementation of NSR \n     permitting requirements will continue to thwart the nation's \n     ability to maintain and expand refinery capacity to meet fuel \n     requirements. In 1998, EPA embarked on an overly aggressive \n     initiative in which it announced new interpretations of its \n     NSR requirements that it has applied retroactively to create \n     a basis for alleging that actions by electric utilities, \n     refineries and other industrial sources taken over the past \n     20 years should have been permitted under the federal NSR \n     program. We also understand that these new interpretations \n     conflict with EPA's regulations, its own prior \n     interpretations and actions, and State permitting agency \n     decisions.\n       EPA's actions have been premised heavily on its \n     reinterpretation of two elements of the NSR permitting \n     requirements. First, EPA's regulations specifically exempt \n     ``routine maintenance, repair and replacement'' activities \n     from NSR permitting. EPA now claims that projects required to \n     be undertaken by utilities and refineries over the past 20 \n     years to maintain plants and a reliable supply of \n     electricity and fuels were not routine and thus should \n     have gone through the 18-month, costly NSR permitting \n     process. EPA's enforcement officials are asserting this \n     even though, for more than two decades, EPA staff have had \n     full knowledge that these maintenance, repair and \n     replacement projects were not being permitted.\n       A second ground for many of EPA's claims has to do with \n     whether projects resulted in significant emissions increases. \n     By employing a discredited method for determining whether \n     emissions increases would result from a project-using so \n     called ``potential emissions'' instead of actual emissions, \n     EPA is asserting that numerous projects resulted in emission \n     increases when in reality they had no effect on emissions or \n     were followed by emissions decreases.\n       EPA's NSR interpretations have created great uncertainty as \n     to whether projects long recognized to be excluded from NSR \n     permitting can be undertaken in the coming months to assure \n     adequate and reliable energy supplies. Electric utilities and \n     refineries have expected that they could undertake \n     maintenance activities, modest plant expansions, and \n     efficiency improvements without going through lengthy and \n     extraordinarily costly NSR permitting, as long as the project \n     involved either routine maintenance or no significant \n     increase in actual emissions.\n       Now, in light of the new interpretations, utilities and \n     refineries find themselves in a position where they cannot \n     undertake these very desirable and important projects. This \n     is not an acceptable result when the nation is faced with \n     severe strains on existing facilities. Against this backdrop, \n     we strongly urge that the National Energy Policy Development \n     Group:\n       Give investigation of EPA's implementation of its NSR \n     requirements a high priority;\n       Suspend EPA's activities until such time as there has been \n     a thorough review of both the policy and its implications;\n       Clarify whether the implications of EPA's new NSR \n     interpretations and its enforcement initiative are being \n     reviewed by the White House Office of Energy Policy and the \n     Secretary of Energy prior to actions that could undermine \n     energy and fuel supply; and\n       Establish guidelines to assure that EPA's application and \n     enforcement of its NSR requirements will not interfere with \n     the Administration's energy and fuel supply policy. \n     Requirements should be developed, which are consistent with \n     responsible implementation of the statutory NSR requirements.\n       Specifically, to assist you in assessing the implications \n     of NSR on meeting the nation's energy and fuel supply \n     demands, you may want to obtain the following: (1) all \n     requests since January 1, 1998 for information under section \n     114 of the Clean Air Act issued to facilities and companies \n     in any sector involved in energy and fuel supply; and (2) \n     notices of violation issued to, and complaints filed against, \n     any such company and/or facility alleging NSR violations \n     during that period. We are submitting a similar request to \n     EPA today.\n       Thank you for your consideration of this matter. We look \n     forward to working with you in the future to develop \n     environmental policy, which further protects human health and \n     the environment and works in concert with sound energy \n     policy.\n           Sincerely,\n     James M. Inhofe,\n       U.S. Senator.\n     John B. Breaux,\n       U.S. Senator.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I publicly thank the administration for \nbeing responsive to the concerns of Senator Breaux and myself. I know \nit took real courage to pursue the NSR reforms. It took courage because \nthe President knew that many people would misconstrue these reforms as \na ``sneak attack on the environment'' in an attempt to score cheap \npolitical points and fundraise.\n  Despite the rhetoric we will hear today and have heard today about \nNSR reforms and the process of developing these reforms, make no \nmistake: President Bush's decision will result in a cleaner environment \nand greater energy security.\n  The Clinton administration developed draft proposals and accumulated \nover 130,000 pages of comments on NSR reform. In fact, on his last day \nat work on January 19, 2001, President Clinton's air chief with the \nEPA, Bob Perciasepe, wrote a letter, No. 1, outlining NSR reforms which \nare similar to the Bush administration's NSR reforms and which are \nalmost identical and, No. 2, calling for the Bush administration to \nconsider finalizing the reforms.\n  At this point in the presentation, I ask unanimous consent to have \nthis letter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                U.S. Environmental\n\n\n                                            Protection Agency,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 19, 2001.\n       Memorandum on the Status of the New Source Review \n     Improvement Rulemaking:\n       Over the last two years we have all worked hard to develop \n     improvements to the New Source Review (NSR) program. As I \n     have discussed with you, I believe it is essential that this \n     program have greater incentives for companies to employ the \n     most effective emission reduction techniques voluntarily and \n     give greater flexibility when companies take these voluntary \n     actions. I am writing to share with you where we are on the \n     NSR Improvement effort as I leave this office.\n       We have come a long way together in developing the \n     conceptual framework for how EPA can improve the NSR program \n     by providing greater certainty and flexibility for industry \n     without sacrificing the level of environmental benefit \n     provided by the current program or meaningful public \n     participation. Due to the array of policy and legal issues \n     that arose on the vast number of areas we attempted to tackle \n     in one very large rulemaking, we were not able to complete \n     the regulatory/packages in this Administration. The concepts \n     that we developed make both economic and environmental sense \n     because in return for environmental performance, industry \n     will receive greater flexibility and more certainty for \n     business investment decisions. The concepts would not \n     undercut the basic goals of the NSR program.\n       The concepts that we developed and which I support are \n     listed below. I believe many of these could be taken as final \n     actions because of the hard work we have done together.\n       Voluntary Alternative NSR Program for the Electric Power \n     Generating Industry.--This voluntary program would allow \n     owners of power plants to commit to specific, verifiable \n     emissions reductions across all their generating units over a \n     defined period\n\n[[Page S1213]]\n\n     of time and in most instances would avoid the need to get an \n     NSR permit when making changes at their facilities.\n       Plantwide Applicability Limits (PALs.--Source owners would \n     be able to make changes to their facilities without obtaining \n     a major NSR permit, provided their emissions do not exceed \n     the plantwide cap. Also, facility owners that use PALs must \n     commit to install best controls over time to gain this \n     flexibility and certainty. PALs would be especially \n     attractive to those industries (e.g., pharmaceuticals and \n     electronics) who need to make changes quickly to respond to \n     market demands in order to stay competitive in a global \n     marketplace;\n       Clarifications of Roles, Responsibilities and Time Frames \n     for Class I Area Reviews.--The process for review of permit \n     applications by Federal Land Managers (FLMs) would be \n     clarified to delineate the roles of the source owner, the \n     permitting authority and the FLM, in conducting permit \n     reviews for sources potentially affecting air quality near \n     national wilderness areas and parks (Federal Class I areas). \n     These changes would reduce delays and disputes associated \n     with permitting applications for sources near Federal Class I \n     areas because they would provide a time frame for the FLM to \n     identify any concerns and analyses needed for the permit \n     applications. Also, it would clarify that the FLM does not \n     have the authority to veto permits, and ensure that the FLM \n     obtains the necessary information to conduct their permit \n     reviews in a timely manner;\n       Clean Unit Exemption.--This exemption would provide an \n     incentive for source owners to install the best emission \n     controls on new or modified emission units and provide \n     flexibility and certainty so that most future changes at such \n     units would not trigger NSR. An owner of an emissions unit \n     that meets certain minimum criteria to be considered \n     ``clean'' could make most changes to these units without \n     triggering NSR for a specified period of time, such as ten \n     years.\n       Innovative Control Technology Waiver.--This waiver would \n     provide more flexibility for owners of sources who risk \n     trying innovative technology that have not yet been proven \n     effective. Should the innovative technologies not perform up \n     to expectations, we would provide the owners with time either \n     to correct the efficiencies or alternatively apply a more \n     standard control technology;\n       Pollution Control Project Exclusion.--This would codify our \n     existing policy that owners of facilities making changes to \n     their plants that primarily reduce one or more targeted air \n     pollutants (but which collaterally increase other pollutants) \n     are excluded from NSR provided certain conditions are met. We \n     would provide a list of environmentally beneficial \n     technologies that, absent other information that would \n     indicate that the projects would not be environmentally \n     beneficial, would be presumptively eligible for the \n     exclusion; and\n       Control Technology Review Requirements.--Because disputes \n     arise over what control technologies are considered \n     available, the permit review process can become lengthy. To \n     improve the process for obtaining a permit, we would (1) add \n     a definition of ``demonstrated in practice,'' (2) provide a \n     ``cut off'' date for consideration of additional control \n     technologies, (3) add provisions that specify when \n     applications are deemed ``complete,'' and (4) require that \n     control technology determinations be entered into a \n     clearinghouse before permits can become effective.\n       Nearly all parties in our discussions identified the need \n     to have all of the data on the latest control technology \n     determinations made by permitting authorities in the EPA \n     clearinghouse. Improving the availability of this information \n     to everyone will greatly assist the permitting process. To \n     this end, I have committee significant resources to gather \n     all of the existing data, input into the database, and \n     redesign the system to make it easier for all parties to put \n     in new data to keep it up-to-date.\n       One of the lessons that we have learned through our ongoing \n     efforts is that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to \n     improve NSR in one large rulemaking. Instead, I believe it is \n     best to make incremental changes that will provide \n     flexibility and certainty without sacrificing the benefits of \n     the current program. I hope the new Administration will \n     consider finalizing the concepts described above that provide \n     flexibility and certainty without compromising environmental \n     protection to make near term progress. I realize there are \n     other issues, such as applicability for the base program, \n     that also need resolution. For these remaining issues, \n     continued discussions in the context of the overall program \n     are needed.\n       I appreciate and thank you for the time, effort and input \n     that you have provided over the past years, and I believe \n     that both industry and environment will benefit from the \n     approaches described above.\n                                                Robert Perciasepe,\n                                          Assistant Administrator.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I very much look forward to seeing the \nfruits of the Clinton and Bush administrations' labors on this issue.\n  From my tenure as chairman of the Senate's Clean Air Subcommittee, I \nknew that New Source Review was a major issue for the energy sector. In \nfact, I held the very first congressional hearings on New Source Review \nin February of 2000 in Ohio. I could not believe my own ears. We heard \nfrom companies that were trying to make environmentally friendly \nmodifications to their facilities being stopped dead in their tracks \nby, ironically, the Clean Air Act.\n  I was also shocked to hear that it took 4,000 pages of guidance \ndocuments to explain 20 pages of regulations. That is 4,000 pages of \nguidance documents just to explain 20 pages of regulations.\n  Since then, my shock at the absurdity of the NSR Program has not worn \noff. We, as a nation, need to rethink the manner in which we approach \nregulations. We all need to keep an open mind during the debates on \nvarious regulatory reform initiatives. I am sick of continually hearing \nthat these are ``sneak attacks on the environment.'' In fact, just the \nopposite is true. If we rethink regulation, we could find ourselves in \na place where we can have far greater environmental protection and more \nreliable and diverse energy sources.\n  Congress and the executive branch must also do a better job of \nunderstanding how the various layers of regulations impact sectors of \nour economy. I normally have a chart which shows all of the different \nregulations that are going to be hitting the various regulated \nsectors--a chart that shows the refiners that are currently working at \nalmost 100-percent capacity are going to be simultaneously hit with a \nnumber of regulations in the next few years. NSR will make it close to \nimpossible for refiners to make these environmental upgrades. Now is \nthe time to work together on these and other regulations to not only \nachieve the environmental goals but also ensure no disruption in fuel \nsupply which would cause the price spikes that we know are inevitable.\n  Higher energy prices affect everyone. However, when the price of \nenergy rises, that means the less fortunate in our society must make a \ndecision between heating their home and keeping the lights on or paying \nfor other essential needs.\n  During a recent EPW Committee hearing last year, Senator Voinovich's \nconstituent, Tom Mullen, articulated this concern. Mr. Mullen stated \nthat in a recent study--which is well known and very well expected--on \nPublic Opinion on Poverty, it was reported that 23 percent of the \npeople in America have difficulty paying for their utilities. That is \none out of every four Americans.\n  I will not support policies, such as NSR, that will hurt the poor in \nOklahoma and around the Nation. Additionally, the lower environmental \nperformance resulting from the current NSR Program impacts Americans in \nevery tax bracket. NSR reforms enjoy the support of a wide range of \ninterests--from the State attorneys general to labor unions to business \ngroups.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record letters from \nthe U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the International Brotherhood of \nBoilermakers in support of NSR reform.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                               Chamber of Commerce\n\n\n                              of the United States of America,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 15, 2002.\n     Hon. James Inhofe,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Inhofe: I am writing on behalf of the U.S. \n     Chamber of Commerce (U.S. Chamber), the world's largest \n     business federation, representing more than three million \n     businesses and organizations of every size, sector, and \n     region, to express our support for reform of the new source \n     review (NSR) program. NSR, in its current form has impeded \n     environmental progress and energy production for decades. The \n     revisions recently announced by the U.S. Environmental \n     Protection Agency (EPA) are a good beginning to reforming a \n     deeply flawed program.\n       The NSR program concerns the Clear Air Act (CAA) emissions \n     standards applicable to significant new and modified \n     stationary sources. In 1980, EPA established a regulatory \n     exclusion for ``routine maintenance.'' The scope of this \n     term, however, remains subject to debate. A clear \n     administrative interpretation of ``routine maintenance'' \n     would be an improvement over the present situation, which is \n     mired in complexity and confusion.\n       Reducing the problems with the NSR program is vital. \n     Governments should not unnecessary impede the work of the \n     private sector. The NSR program is a classic example of \n     bureaucratic complexity. More than 20 years after the initial \n     regulation, a plant manager cannot determine with any \n     certainty whether planned maintenance activities will subject \n     the facility to millions of dollars of extra costs.\n\n[[Page S1214]]\n\n       The NSR program, as presently constituted, is a severe \n     impediment to increasing domestic energy supply. Electric \n     generating plants cannot make even minor changes in to their \n     operations without running the risk of ruinous enforcement \n     actions that would impose huge fines and enormous compliance \n     costs on their facility. National energy policy, indeed \n     national security, requires the removal of every obstacle to \n     increased domestic energy production.\n       The National Energy Policy Report directed EPA to review \n     the NSR program, and report on its effect on environmental \n     protection and energy production. EPA's review found that the \n     NSR program has impeded or resulted in the cancellation of \n     projects that would maintain or improve reliability, \n     efficiency, or safety of existing power plants and \n     refineries.\n       On June 13, 2002, EPA announced a set of revisions to the \n     NSR program. Among other changes, facilities would be able to \n     make physical changes to their plants without obtaining an \n     NSR permit, if their emissions do not exceed a plantwide cap. \n     Projects would be excluded from NSR requirements if they \n     result in a net overall reduction of air pollutants. EPA \n     would also establish a safe harbor test. Projects whose \n     aggregate costs are below the threshold established by the \n     safe harbor test would be exempt from NSR requirements.\n       These proposals promise a major improvements to the NSR \n     program. They will lead to improvements in the environment, \n     as regulatory certainty will allow facilities to perform \n     routine maintenance and repairs without the fear of \n     triggering NSR requirements. Plants have deferred routine \n     maintenance, which would have improved safety and decreased \n     emissions, due to the potential costs of NSR requirements. \n     With the NSR program modifications, overall emissions will be \n     reduced. The reforms, particularly the plantwide cap, will \n     benefit facilities by allowing increased operational \n     flexibility. The revised NSR program will simplify an overly \n     complex program.\n       The recently announced NSR reforms are log overdue. The \n     regulations to be made final later this year were proposed in \n     1996. The proposals requiring notice and comment rulemaking \n     will not be in effect until 2004, at the earliest.\n       The U.S. Chamber supports reform of the NSR program. The \n     U.S. Chamber urges the Senate to encourage these efforts to \n     improve environmental progress and energy production.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              R. Bruce Josten,\n\n                                         Executive Vice President,\n     Government Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n\n      Statement of Ande Abbott, Director, Legislative Department, \n  International Brotherhood of Boilermakers on the New Source Review \n                                Program\n\n       Chairman Jeffords, Chairman Leahy, and members of the \n     Committees, my name is Ande Abbott and I am the Director of \n     Legislation for the International Brotherhood of \n     Boilermakers, Iron Ship Builders, Blacksmiths, Forgers and \n     Helpers, AFL-CIO. I thank you for this opportunity to present \n     our views.\n       Commonly referred to as the Boilermakers Union, we are a \n     diverse union representing over 100,000 workers throughout \n     the United States and Canada in construction, repair, \n     maintenance, manufacturing, professional emergency medical \n     services, and related industries. Boilermakers, who make and \n     maintain industrial boilers and the pollution control \n     equipment they use, have had a long-time commitment to a \n     clear, effective and reasonable new source review (``NSR'') \n     policy. We support the recent efforts of this Administration \n     to clarify the program. The efficiency of our facilities and \n     the safety of our workers hang in the balance.\n       First, let me be clear today that Boilermakers do not \n     oppose the Clean Air Act, nor do we oppose its rigorous \n     enforcement. In fact, construction lodges of our union look \n     forward to doing much of the actual work for the installation \n     of new technologies and controls at utility plants and for \n     industrial boilers across this region and the country. In \n     reference to the NOX control program alone, our \n     international President Charlie Jones recently wrote:\n       ``The EPA estimates that compliance measures will cost \n     about $1.7 billion a year. A sizable portion of that money \n     will go to the Boilermakers who do the work necessary to make \n     the additions and modifications required by the SCR \n     technology.''\n       Aside from NOX control, Boilermakers have always \n     led the way on Clean Air Act issues. For example, \n     Boilermakers were pioneers in installation of scrubbers and \n     further in fuel-substitution programs at our cement kiln \n     facilities. In short, Boilermakers have been there to meet \n     the challenges of the Clean Air Act, to the benefit our \n     members and all Americans that breathe clean air.\n       However, Boilermakers could not support the EPA's 1999 \n     recent interpretation of its authority under the New Source \n     Review program. NSR, correctly interpreted as we believe the \n     Administration's clarification does, forces new sources or \n     those undergoing major modifications, to install new \n     technology, like the technology President Jones mentioned. We \n     support NSR in that context.\n       But, when NSR is applied to the routine maintenance \n     policies and schedules of existing facilities, very different \n     results occur. In those cases, facilities are discouraged \n     from undertaking routine actions for fear of huge penalties \n     or long delays or both. By applying NSR in that way, we are \n     pretty sure that Boilermakers won't have the opportunity to \n     work on maintenance projects that we know are extremely \n     important to energy efficiency. Just hearing about recent \n     events in California is enough to make the case that \n     facilities need to be as efficient as possible. We now have \n     read that New York may be facing similar problems. The New \n     York Times reported just a few days ago that, the State ``is \n     unexpectedly facing the potential for serious power shortages \n     over the next couple of months.'' Now is definitely not the \n     time to play with the reliability of a power grid.\n       Efficiency is not the only reason to encourage routine \n     maintenance. Experienced professionals or Boilermakers new to \n     the trade can both tell you: maintenance is necessary to \n     maintain worker safety. Electric generating facilities \n     harness tremendous forces: superheater tubes exposed to flue \n     gases over 2000 degrees; boilers under deteriorating \n     conditions; and parts located in or around boilers subjected \n     to both extreme heat and pressure. Any EPA interpretation \n     which creates incentives to delay maintenance is simply \n     unacceptable to our workers.\n       Some critics of the June 13 action by the Administration \n     have contended that the NSR decision was made with \n     insufficient attention to public process. This simply has not \n     been the experience of the Boilermakers or other unions \n     working on this project. The U.S. EPA held four public \n     hearings in each region of the country. Paul Kern, the \n     recording secretary of our Local 105 in Piketon, Ohio, \n     offered a statement at the hearing in Cincinnati. In \n     addition, it is our understanding that over 130,000 \n     rulemaking comments were received on this initiative. Given \n     our experience with certain regulations that just seem to \n     appear over night, the Administration's action NSR seem \n     pretty open and fair to us. When you compare the current \n     clarification to the way the program changed in 1999--without \n     any rulemaking process whatsoever--the Administration's June \n     13 announcement looks all the better!\n       Boilermakers are not just workers; they are also consumers \n     of electricity that work hard for their wages. One item often \n     lost in the mess regarding NSR is that capital expenditures \n     not justified for environmental protection are still passed \n     along to ratepayers. Unfortunately, the less money you make, \n     the greater the percentage of your paycheck goes to your \n     electricity bills. According to Energy Information \n     Administration data, those living at or near the poverty \n     level pay 4 to 6 times the percentage of their income for \n     power. So, advocates of misusing the NSR program hurt those \n     least able to afford it the most!\n       As you can see, Boilermakers have never asked for repeal or \n     substantial revision of the NSR program. We encourage the \n     development and installation of new technology, and we stand \n     ready to continue to train and apprentice workers to meet the \n     needs of the Clean Air Act. However, when the NSR programs \n     goes where it wasn't intended--and discourages the very \n     maintenance, repair and replacement activities that \n     constitute the livelihood of Boilermakers--we must strongly \n     object. Thanks for the opportunity to make a statement.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, the environmental community does not have \nto answer to the American people when energy prices go through the \nroof. But the President of the United States does, and we do, too. I \nthink the President is doing the right thing, and we should support him \nfor it.\n  So, in summary, this is one of the rare things that both the Clinton \nadministration and the Bush administration have proposed which enjoys \nsupport by virtually all the labor unions as well as the business \norganizations, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and other organizations, \nand the American people who want lower cost energy.\n  Mr. President, I am offering a second-degree amendment to Senator \nEdwards' rider on the New Source Review. In his amendment, Senator \nEdwards asks the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a study on the \nimpacts of implementing the NSR reform package and to delay the reforms \nin the interim.\n  In our judgment, there is no reason for this delay. We have delayed \nalready for 10 years. We have been living with this thing for 10 years. \nWe need reforms now.\n  Therefore, I am offering a second-degree amendment to allow the NSR \nfinal package to move forward, but to allow the National Academy of \nSciences to conduct a study. When the NAS completes its study, the EPA \ncan then benefit from its results. I suggest that the National Academy \nof Sciences will be getting their information from the EPA because they \nare the ones who have accumulated all the data to date, and there is no \nmore data that is available. There is nothing to be lost by offering \nthis as a second-degree amendment. You would have the benefit of the \nNAS study as well as moving along the time for implementation.\n\n[[Page S1215]]\n\n  There is simply no reason to delay the implementation of the final \nNSR package. The Edwards amendment calls for a study before the final \nNew Source Review rules go final. I guess the Senator from North \nCarolina has not read the administrative record on the regulations. If \nhe had, he would see that the EPA conducted a thorough environmental \nanalysis of the final NSR proposals.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the analysis be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              Environmental Protection Agency,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 19, 2001.\n\n\n                               memorandum\n\n     Subject: Status of the New Source Review Improvement \n         Rulemaking.\n     To: New Source Review Stakeholders.\n     From: Robert Perciasepe, Assistant Administrator.\n       Over the last two years we have all worked hard to develop \n     improvements to the New Source Review (NSR) program. As I \n     have discussed with you, I believe it is essential that this \n     program have greater incentives for companies to employ the \n     most effective emission reduction techniques voluntarily and \n     give greater flexibility when companies take these voluntary \n     actions. I am writing to share with you where we are on the \n     NSR Improvement effort as I leave this office.\n       We have come a long way together in developing the \n     conceptual framework for how EPA can improve the NSR program \n     by providing greater certainty and flexibility for industry \n     without sacrificing the level of environmental benefit \n     provided by the current program or meaningful public \n     participation. Due to the array of policy and legal issues \n     that arose on the vast number of areas we attempted to tackle \n     in one very large rulemaking, we were not able to complete \n     the regulator/packages in this Administration. The concepts \n     that we developed make both economic and environmental sense \n     because in return for environmental performance, industry \n     will receive greater flexibility and more certainty for \n     business investment decisions. The concepts would not \n     undercut the basic goals of the NSR program.\n       The concepts that we developed and which I support are \n     listed below. I believe many of these could be taken as final \n     actions because of the hard work we have done together.\n       Voluntary Alternative NSR Program for the Electric Power \n     Generating Industry--This voluntary program would allow \n     owners of power plants to commit to specific, verifiable \n     emissions reductions across all their electric generating \n     units over a defined period of time and in most instances \n     would avoid the need to get an NSR permit when making changes \n     at their facilities.\n       Plantwide Applicability Limits (PALs)--Source owners would \n     be able to make changes to their facilities without obtaining \n     a major NSR permit, provided their emissions do not exceed \n     the plantwide cap. Also, facility owners that use PALs must \n     commit to install best controls over time to gain this \n     flexibility and certainty. PALs would be especially \n     attractive to those industries (e.g., pharmaceuticals and \n     electronics) who need to make changes quickly to respond to \n     market demands in order to stay competitive in a global \n     marketplace.\n       Clarifications of Roles Responsibilities and Time Frames \n     for Class I Area Reviews--The process for review of permit \n     applications by Federal Land Managers (FLMs) would be \n     clarified to delineate the roles of the source owner, the \n     permitting authority and the FLM, in conducting permit \n     reviews for sources potentially affecting air quality near \n     national wilderness areas and parks (Federal Class I areas). \n     These changes would reduce delays and disputes associated \n     with permitting applications for sources near Federal Class I \n     areas because they would provide a time frame for the FLM to \n     identify any concerns and analyses needed for the permit \n     applications. Also, it would clarify that the FLM does not \n     have the authority to veto permits, and ensure that the FLM \n     obtains the necessary information to conduct their permit \n     reviews in a timely manner.\n       Clean Unit Exemption--This exemption would provide an \n     incentive for source owners to install the best emission \n     controls on new or modified emission units and provide \n     flexibility and certainty so that most future changes at such \n     units would not trigger NSR. An owner of an emissions unit \n     that meets certain minimum criteria to be considered \n     ``clean'' could make most changes to these units without \n     triggering NSR for a specified period of time, such as ten \n     years.\n       Innovative Control Technology Waiver--This waiver would \n     provide more flexibility for owners of sources who risk \n     trying innovative technologies that have not yet been proven \n     effective. Should the innovative technologies not perform up \n     to expectations, we would provide the owners with time either \n     to correct the deficiencies or alternatively apply a more \n     standard control technology.\n       Pollution Control Project Exclusion--This would codify our \n     existing policy that owners of facilities making changes to \n     their plants that primarily reduce one or more targeted air \n     pollutants (but which collaterally increase other pollutants) \n     are excluded from NSR provided certain conditions are met. We \n     would provide a list of environmentally beneficial \n     technologies that, absent other information that would \n     indicate that the projects would not be environmentally \n     beneficial, would be presumptively eligible for the \n     exclusion.\n       Control Technology Review Requirements--Because disputes \n     arise over what control technologies are considered \n     available, the permit review process can become lengthy. To \n     improve the process for obtaining a permit, we would (1) add \n     a definition of ``demonstrated in practice,'' (2) provide a \n     ``cut off'' date for consideration of additional control \n     technologies, (3) add provisions that specify when \n     applications are deemed ``complete,'' and (4) require that \n     control technology determinations be entered into a \n     clearinghouse before permits can become effective.\n       Nearly all parties in our discussions identified the need \n     to have all of the data on the latest control technology \n     determinations made by permitting authorities in the EPA \n     clearinghouse. Improving the availability of this information \n     to everyone will greatly assist the permitting process. To \n     this end, I have committed significant resources to gather \n     all of the existing data, input it into the database, and \n     redesign the system to make it easier for all parties to put \n     in new data to keep it up-to-date.\n       One of the lessons that we have learned through our ongoing \n     efforts is that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to \n     improve NSR in one large rulemaking. Instead, I believe it is \n     best to make incremental changes that will provide \n     flexibility and certainty without sacrificing the benefits of \n     the current program. I hope the new Administration will \n     consider finalizing the concepts described above that provide \n     flexibility and certainty without compromising environmental \n     protection to make near term progress. I realize there are \n     other issues, such as applicability for the base program, \n     that also need resolution. For these remaining issues, \n     continued discussions in the context of the overall program \n     are needed.\n       I appreciate and thank you for the time, effort and input \n     that you have provided over the past years, and I believe \n     that both industry and the environment will benefit from the \n     approaches described above.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I would like to read from the EPA's own \nenvironmental analysis:\n\n       The overall effect of the final rule will be a net benefit \n     to the environment.\n\n  My second-degree amendment calls for a NAS study to look at the \nimpacts of the regulation after implementation of the final rules while \nallowing the regulations to go forward, thus allowing cleaner and more \nefficient technologies to be installed in our Nation's manufacturing \ncenters.\n  Delaying these regulations would delay projects to create safer \nworkplaces. The International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, a member of \nthe AFL-CIO, has recently opined against the proposed delay in the \nfinal package on the New Source Review. I would like to read just a \nsmall part of their letter and then will have the rest of the letter \nprinted in the Record. This letter is a current letter dated today from \nthe International Brotherhood of Boilermakers. It says:\n\n       We have encouraged the Environmental Protection Agency to \n     clarify the program as soon as possible, and oppose efforts \n     in Congress to slow reform down. The efficiency and \n     competitiveness of our facilities and the safety of our \n     workers hang in the balance. This is a jobs and safety issue \n     for millions of American workers.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n         International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, Iron Ship \n           Builders, Blacksmiths, Forgers & Helpers,\n                                    Fairfax, VA, January 21, 2003.\n     Re Opposition to Appropriations Rider Delaying New Source \n         Review Reform.\n\n     Senator John Edwards,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Edwards: On behalf of the International \n     Brotherhood of Boilermakers, Iron Ship Builders, Blacksmiths, \n     Forgers and Helpers, ALF-CIO, I am writing to express our \n     support for clarification of the New Source Review, or NSR, \n     program and our opposition to any effort to derail NSR \n     clarification through the appropriations process. Therefore, \n     we urge you and your colleagues not to offer an \n     appropriations rider delaying implementation of the final NSR \n     rules.\n       Commonly referred to as the Boilermakers Union, we are a \n     diverse union representing over 100,000 workers throughout \n     the United States and Canada in construction, repair, \n     maintenance, manufacturing, professional emergency medical \n     services, and related industries. Boilermakers, who make and \n     maintain industrial boilers and the pollution control \n     equipment they use, have had a long-time commitment to a \n     clear, effective and reasonable NSR policy. We have \n     encouraged the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)\n\n[[Page S1216]]\n\n     to clarify the program as soon as possible, and oppose \n     efforts in Congress to slow reform down. The efficiency and \n     competitiveness of our facilities and the safety of our \n     workers hang in the balance. This is a jobs and safety issue \n     for millions of American workers.\n       First, let me be clear today that Boilermakers do not \n     oppose the Clean Air Act, nor do we oppose its rigorous \n     enforcement. In fact, construction lodges of our union look \n     forward to doing much of the actual work for the installation \n     of new technologies and controls at utility plants and for \n     industrial boilers across this region and the country. In \n     reference to the NOX control program alone, our \n     international President Charlie Jones recently wrote:\n       ``The EPA estimates that compliance measures will cost \n     about $1.7 billion a year. A sizeable portion of that money \n     will go to the Boilermakers who do the work necessary to make \n     the additions and modifications required by the SCR \n     technology.''\n       NSR, correctly interpreted as we hope EPA's new rules will \n     do, forces new sources or those undergoing major \n     modifications, to install new technology, like the technology \n     President Jones mentioned. We support NSR in that context.\n       However, when NSR is applied in an unclear or inflexible \n     manner to existing facilities, very different results occur. \n     In those cases, facilities are discouraged from undertaking \n     appropriate actions for fear of huge penalties or long delays \n     or both. By applying NSR in that way, we are pretty sure that \n     Boilermakers won't have the opportunity to work on projects \n     that we know are extremely important to energy efficiency. \n     Further, by reducing the useful economic life of boilers or \n     by inaccurately setting baselines, the existing NSR confusion \n     undermines the competitiveness of American job sites. And \n     that means some of the almost 20 million manufacturing jobs \n     at stake in heavy industry are placed at risk.\n       Finalizing new NSR rules is also important to maintain \n     worker safety. Industrial and utility boilers harness \n     tremendous forces: superheater tubes exposed to flue gases \n     over 2000 degrees; boilers under deteriorating conditions; \n     and parts located in or around boilers subjected to both \n     extreme heat and pressure. Any delay of these important EPA \n     rules is simply unacceptable to our workers.\n       Some have argued that the final NSR rules can await further \n     study. However, the U.S. EPA held four public hearings in \n     each region of the country on the proposal. Paul Kern, the \n     recording secretary of our Local 105 in Piketon, Ohio, \n     offered a statement at the hearing in Cincinnati. In \n     addition, it is our understanding that over 130,000 \n     rulemaking comments were received on this initiative, and \n     over 50 stakeholder meetings were held.\n       As you can see, Boilermakers have never asked for repeal or \n     substantial revision of the NSR program. We encourage the \n     development and installation of new technology, and we stand \n     ready to continue to train and apprentice workers to meet the \n     needs of the Clean Air Act. However, when the NSR program \n     goes where it wasn't intended--and creates uncertainty \n     regarding the very livelihood of Boilermakers--we must \n     strongly object. Therefore, we ask you and your colleagues \n     not to offer any appropriations rider delaying the final NSR \n     rules.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Ande Abbott,\n                                          Director of Legislation.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, some supporters of the Edwards rider in \nits current form suggest that delay is justified because State \nofficials seek it. Nothing could be further from reality. Two years \nago, a unanimous resolution of the National Governors Association was \npassed. It says:\n\n       New Source Review requirements should be reformed to \n     achieve improvements that enhance the environment and \n     increase energy production capacity, while encouraging energy \n     efficiency, fuel diversity and the use of renewable \n     resources.\n\n  The Nation's environmental commissioners passed a subsequent \namendment, stating:\n\n       The Environmental Council of the States adopts the \n     provisions of the NGA [the National Governors' Association] \n     policy. The Environmental Council of the States encourages \n     the United States EPA to reform the New Source Review \n     Regulations into a workable regulation that is easily \n     understood and effectively implemented.\n\n  These positions reflect the true direction of the majority of States. \nI think there is a propensity in this body for us to think that wisdom \nin Washington is greater than that of the States. That is not true. So \nyou have a unanimous resolution from the Governors as well as the \nEnvironmental Council of the States.\n  The bottom line is this: My second-degree amendment allows the EPA \nand the States to benefit from the wisdom of the National Academy of \nSciences on the important issues of clean air policy. However, my \namendment does not create potential dangers inherent in delaying the \nonset of the important and thoughtful administrative reforms of the NSR \nprogram.\n  So I offer a second-degree amendment to the Edwards first-degree \namendment No. 67 and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Inhofe] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 86 to amendment No. 67.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 1, strike all after ``Sec.'' and insert the \n     following:\n       ``  . (a) Cooperative Agreement.--As soon as practicable \n     after the date of enactment of this Act, the Administrator of \n     the Environmental Protection Agency shall enter into a \n     cooperative agreement with the National Academy of Sciences \n     to evaluate the impact of the final rule relating to \n     prevention of significant deterioration and nonattainment new \n     source review, published at 67 Fed. Reg. 80186 (December 31, \n     2002). The study shall include--\n       (1) increases or decreases in emissions of pollutants \n     regulated under the New Source Review program;\n       (2) impacts on human health;\n       (3) pollution control and prevention technologies installed \n     after the effective date of the rule at facilities covered \n     under the rulemaking;\n       (4) increases or decreases in efficiency of operations, \n     including energy efficiency, at covered facilities; and\n       (5) other relevant data.\n       (b) Deadline.--The NAS shall submit an interim report to \n     Congress no later than March 3, 2004, and shall submit a \n     final report on implementation of the rules.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if my friend will withhold, I have a couple \ncomments I would like to make.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I am glad to withhold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the second-degree \namendment of my friend, the chairman of the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee. The amendment offered by Senator Edwards, and \ncosponsored by Senators Lieberman, Jeffords, Daschle, and Senator Reid \nof Nevada, really is a very modest amendment.\n  This administration has gone ahead with the most radical rewriting of \nthe clean air rules in 30 years. Let me repeat that. The \nadministration, administratively, has caused the most radical rewriting \nof the clean air rules in 30 years. They have not studied what the \neffects of these rules will be for people's health and the environment. \nI think Senators on both sides of the gaisle have asked for this study. \nThey have refused to do it.\n  This amendment simply says, let's wait 6 months--just 6 months--and \nget a real study of how this amendment will affect people. Our \namendment says, because these rules have the potential to be harmful, \nwe should study them first to make sure we know how they will affect \npeople's health. The amendment says, let's wait until we get that \nsettled--6 months, a half a year--before letting the rules become \nfinal.\n  The second-degree amendment says: Yes, we need to study those rules, \nbut let's have the study after the rules go into effect; that is, let \nthe rules go into effect first; and, second, we will study the effects. \nThat means you are rolling the dice with people's health.\n  What this second-degree amendment says is, we will take our chances \nwith the health of your children, with the health of your parents. What \nwe say is, let the amendment go into effect after we have studied the \nissue.\n  What are we going to do a year from now if this study shows--and I am \nconfident it will--that these radical changes will have made people's \nhealth worse? What are we going to say to senior citizens who are \nsuffering from respiratory illnesses, as a great deal do?\n  It was less than a year ago that one of the weekly magazines--I \nbelieve it was Newsweek; ran a front-page article that talked about the \nasthma epidemic sweeping this country afflicting our children. Although \nthey do not determinatively know why, one of the conclusions they \narrive at is because of the bad air. However, I don't think we need \nscientific studies to show that.\n  By allowing the administration to go forward with this rule, what we \nare really saying is we do not care. We want these companies to go \nahead and be able to continue their polluting--yet we only studied two \ncompanies.\n  We hear that the Environmental Protection Agency today has actually\n\n[[Page S1217]]\n\ndone the environmental analysis and it shows that these radical rule \nchanges would protect the environment. That is foolishness. It is not \ntrue.\n  The EPA gave us hundreds of pages of old, irrelevant reports.\n  They said their assessment was qualitative and not quantitative. That \nis a buzzword for ``we have done nothing.'' It means they didn't do \nreal hard research in how these changes would affect people, children \nwith asthma, and seniors with respiratory illness.\n  One group did the real hard research. The Environmental Integrity \nProject looked at two factories and found that just with these two \nfactories, the administration rules would increase pollution by more \nthan 120 tons a year. One of these EPA studies done by the current \nEnvironmental Protection Agency points to Delaware as a model. \nCompanies in Delaware have taken some good measures to reduce \npollution. That is true. But as industries in Delaware have pointed out \nand as Senator Biden has pointed out, this administration is not \nfollowing the Delaware model. They are following a different and anti-\nenvironmental model.\n  The amendment of the Senator from North Carolina does not discourage \nenergy efficiency. All of us support more energy efficiency. We support \nreform of the New Source Review. We want to reduce pollution at the \nsame time as we reform. We don't want reform being an excuse to \nincrease pollution. The new rules would increase pollution.\n  Again, the amendment of the Senator from North Carolina is a modest \namendment. It says: Look before you leap. However, what we are being \ntold to do with the second-degree amendment is look after you leap. \nThat is not the same.\n  Look before you leap; that is what we should do. The second-degree \namendment is misguided, misdirected. It takes away from the importance \nand the dignity of the amendment offered by the Senator from North \nCarolina which simply says, the President wants to move forward with \nradical changes in the Clean Air Act, an act which has been in effect \nfor some 30 years, so before we do this, let's first wait 6 months to \nsee if the changes the administration suggested will hurt the \nenvironment.\n  I certainly hope the amendment of the Senator from North Carolina \npasses in its form before the Senate and that the second-degree \namendment does not pass. I say that because if you look at the track \nrecord of the administration, you are looking at a track record that is \nnot good.\n  We know the administration came out initially with an effort to \nchange the arsenic standards in water. We were able to turn that back. \nWe know the administration has worked very hard to make sure that the \nrules relating to testing children to find out if lead in their \nenvironment is bad--they tried to eliminate that. We were able to stop \nthat.\n  Clean water: The administration proposed earlier this month changes \nfor managing waterways under the Clean Water Act. The proposed rules \nwould affect enforcement of the Clean Water Act by defining protected \nand unprotected lakes, rivers, streams, and wetlands. This rule would \nremove 20 million acres of wetlands from protection.\n  On January 3--just a few weeks ago--the administration issued \ncategorical exclusions under the National Environmental Policy Act for \ncertain timber projects. As a result, the agency will be able to \napprove logging in burned, diseased, and insect-infested forests \nwithout completing individual environmental reviews.\n  On December 31, the administration proposed regulations that would \nallow tuna caught by encircling dolphins to be labeled ``dolphin \nsafe.'' For the last 5 years, tuna caught using dolphins as targets \nwere barred from bearing the ``dolphin safe'' label.\n\n  Two days after Christmas, the administration came up with a Christmas \npresent when they issued new guidelines that would allow more \ndevelopment of wetlands and additional mitigation. However, the \nexistence of wetlands is important because they filter drinking water, \nretain flood waters, and support wildlife.\n  The administration on December 23--2 days before Christmas--issued a \nfinal rule that would allow States to claim ownership of roads in \nnational parks, forests, wilderness areas, and other public lands. \nUnder this rule, States could assert claims to thousands of miles of \ndirt roads, trails, and wagon tracks--many of which are in wilderness \nareas and other public lands.\n  On December 19, the administration issued a cost-benefit report \ncalling for more than 300 rules to be revised and eliminated, or \nexpanded. These changes affect food safety standards, arsenic in \ndrinking water, energy conservation standards, and logging in national \nforests.\n  Again dealing with clean water, on December 16 they issued final \nregulations under a court-ordered deadline that would weaken clean \nwater protections concerning concentrated animal feeding operations. \nThe new rule will affect 15,000 large and medium size U.S. corporate \nfarms.\n  On salmon protection, the administration proposed new regulations to \nweaken salmon protections and to allow increased logging in the \nPacific.\n  On November 22 of last year, the administration issued final \nregulations that would weaken the Clean Air Act's New Source Review \nprogram. The administration has issued standards relating to drilling \nin national parks. They approved natural gas drilling in Padre Island \nNational Seashore in Texas, the Nation's longest stretch of undeveloped \nbeach. They are going to take care of that and allow drilling there.\n  On climate change, on November 20 the chairman of the White House \nCouncil on Environmental Quality said: ``Climate change is a technology \nissue.'' He believes technological innovations, not curbs on emissions \nof greenhouse gases, are the solution to global climate change.\n  Snowmobiles, something on which I have worked hard: The \nadministration proposed to increase the number of snowmobiles allowed \nin Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks by more than 35 percent, \neven though the rangers there must use respirators and masks because \nthe air is so bad because of the snowmobiles.\n  Should we not, with a record like this, take 6 months to see if the \nrules are going to be bad? I didn't read all of them, but you get the \nidea why I am a little suspect about the rules and why we should not \nleap before we look. Let's look, have a study done to find out if the \nrules are as bad as the environmental community says they are.\n  I hope the second-degree amendment of my friend from Oklahoma is \ndefeated and we have an up-or-down vote on the amendment to call for a \nstudy before we enact the very extreme radical rule changes with the \nClean Air Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Let me respond to the distinguished Senator from Nevada.\n  First, this has nothing to do with tuna, dolphins, drilling, \nsnowmobiles in the Tetons. The record of this President has been very \ngood. We passed extensive brownfields legislation with the help of the \nSenator occupying the chair. My amendment included over 200,000 \npetroleum sites. The record has been good.\n  It is important, when you are talking about this issue, to talk about \nthe Bush administration. This essentially came from the Clinton \nadministration, not from the Bush administration. With the exception of \na few technicalities which have been worked out to everyone's \nadvantage, this is the Clinton administration's program.\n  Here is the statement made at the last day of the Clinton \nadministration by Bob Perciasepe:\n\n       Over the last two years we have all worked hard to develop \n     improvements to the New Source Review program. As I have \n     discussed with you, I believe it is essential that this \n     program have greater incentives for companies to employ the \n     most effective emissions techniques voluntarily and give \n     greater flexibility when companies take these voluntary \n     actions.\n\n  And so then we had this study. Look at this study. It is 180 pages. \nThe study comes to the conclusion that the overall effect of the final \nrule will be a net benefit to the environment. This is going to benefit \nthe environment, not hurt it.\n  When the Senator from Nevada says, what do we say to senior citizens, \nI say what do we say to senior citizens when their energy costs go up, \nwhen they already have to decide whether to heat their homes or have \nfood to eat.\n  We have studied this matter for 10 years. We don't need 6 more \nmonths.\n\n[[Page S1218]]\n\nHowever, we are willing to have the NAS do a study, and they will use \nthe same data the EPA used in coming up with the conclusion that this \nis not harmful, but it is good for the environment and health.\n  I will be joining my friend from Nevada in asking for a recorded vote \non this second-degree amendment at the appropriate time.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, during the last few session days, I have been rising \nto bring the Senate's attention to an issue which I think is very \nimportant. We have had a lot of discussion in this body about the \nconcern for deficits. I share those concerns about how much money we \nare going to be borrowing in the future. One of the principal reasons \nfor these discussions, particularly from Democratic Members, is their \nconcern that because of these deficits going forward, we cannot give \nor--let me put it this way--let people in America keep more of their \nmoney and provide tax relief, as the President has proposed, to try to \nstimulate this economy.\n  The President has proposed in the area of $600 billion in tax relief \nover the next 10 years to try to help put more money into the private \nsector to help create jobs, secure jobs, and grow this economy. I think \nthat is a very worthy goal.\n  Economic growth is vitally important for all of us in America. It \ncreates job security. It creates new opportunities for advancement. It \nincreases our standard of living. I believe everybody in this Chamber \nwould agree that one of our priorities should be to create more jobs \nand create a stronger economy. The President has put forward a package \nwhich he believes will do that.\n  One of the major criticisms against the package is that it adds too \nmuch to the deficit; that while maybe some of these ideas are good \nideas--letting people keep more of their money, providing incentives \nfor people to invest, businesses to invest in capital equipment, \nstopping the double taxation of dividends--all those may or may not be \ngood ideas, depending on to whom you listen--even if they are good \nideas, we cannot afford it, we simply do not have enough money; \nfrankly, we are running these deficits, so we have to be fiscally \nresponsible--I am talking about the Democratic conversations of late--\nthat we have to be fiscally responsible and not provide this tax \nrelief.\n  What I am going to do in the next few days as we continue to debate \nthis year's appropriations bills, the 2003 appropriations bills--not \nnext, but this year, since we did not get our job done last fall and \npass the appropriations bills for this year--is I am going to detail \nall of the amendments the Democrats are offering and begin to add up \nthe 10-year costs of these amendments.\n  We have the first amendment offered by Senator Byrd on homeland \nsecurity, which is $70 billion over the next 10 years.\n  Senator Kennedy's amendment on education was $84 billion, which \nbrought the total to $154 billion. Senators Hollings' and Murray's \namendment on Amtrak, that was $5 billion over 10 years. Senator \nHarkin's amendment, $7 billion over 10 years, and then Senator Byrd's \namendment, which was to basically strip away what was a mechanism to \ntry to pay for some of these increases such as education and others, \nwhich was an across-the-board reduction, he eliminated the across-the-\nboard reduction which basically put $154 billion on to the deficit over \nthe next 10 years.\n  Pending is Senator Dodd's amendment, which adds $21 billion over the \nnext 10 years in the area of paying for education for people with \ndisabilities.\n  We have already had a majority of Democrats, in fact almost every \nsingle Democrat, vote for $320 billion in new spending and now we have \nanother $21 billion on which to be voted. There are a whole host of \nother amendments which have to be filed by 6 p.m. today, which will add \nrobustly, I suspect, to this total of $341 billion to date that have \nbeen offered by Members on the other side of the aisle who have come to \nthis Chamber repeatedly and suggested that, we cannot provide tax \nrelief to spur this economy to create jobs and to put more money out on \nto the private sector into taxpayers' pockets but we can afford almost \nhalf of what the President's tax reduction measure will cost.\n  It is important to show where the priorities are of the respective \nparties. What we have suggested is that to help this economy get going \nwe need to put more money in taxpayers' hands so we can create a \nstronger economy and a better quality of life for people in America. \nMany on the other side, not all, have said that is not acceptable.\n  What is their alternative? Well, this appears to be their \nalternative: To grow the size and scope of Government in increasing \namounts.\n  We made a mistake. We made this chart too small. My guess is by the \ntime we are done we are going to have a line of charts as to how much \nmoney we are going to add to the deficit at a time when we are hearing \nall this gnashing of teeth about the President's tax plan that is \nsimply too expensive, that it adds too much to the deficit. Yet time \nafter time Members on the other side are more than willing to add money \nto the deficit. As long as we spend it on Government programs, as long \nas we spend it on growing the size and scope of the Federal Government, \nthey are willing to spend taxpayers' dollars and willing to put the \ndeficit to even higher levels.\n  To set the record straight, when we hear the debate on taxes, as we \nwill later this year and we will hear Members coming to the Chamber \nsaying we cannot afford this tax reduction, remember what they thought \nthey could afford and that is a much bigger Federal Government, more \ntax dollars being spent in Washington, DC, and higher deficits as a \nresult.\n  I will be back after each series of amendments we vote on and we will \nbe adding to this chart. I am hopeful this number of votes for these \namendments will begin to change. Where we look at almost every single \nDemocrat voting for these large increases in spending, I am hopeful \nthat at some point there will be a recognition that it is important to \ncontrol the growth of Government spending, it is important not to have \nbig deficits in ever increasing amounts, and we will see some \ncontraction in these numbers.\n  Time will tell what will happen in the Senate over the next several \ndays as we begin to debate more amendments offered by the other side of \nthe aisle to add more money to the deficit which they decry as already \ntoo big in the first place.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Rhode Island will offer a very important \namendment on unemployment insurance. I ask unanimous consent that \nfollowing my remarks, the Senator from North Dakota be recognized to \nspeak for 15 minutes; following that, the Senator from Rhode Island be \nrecognized to offer an amendment.\n  I have spoken to the manager of the bill and have indicated to him \nthat we were going to offer this amendment. I ask unanimous consent, \ntherefore, that when Senator Reed offers his amendment the pending \namendment be set aside. If there is a problem with that, that would \ngive time to someone on the other side to be available to object having \nthat set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. My friend, the junior Senator from Pennsylvania, has come \nto this Chamber on other occasions with his chart and talked about the \nDemocratic amendments. What he has not talked about is the fact that a \nyear ago, we had a huge surplus. There are estimates that it was as \nmuch as $7.2 trillion--some say it was only $6 trillion--over a 10-year \nperiod. As a result of what has taken place with this administration, \nthat is gone. We are now spending in the red and using Social Security \nsurpluses to pay for the Bush economic plan.\n  I was on a TV program with Senator Nickles, who was my counterpart. \nThe person doing the interviewing showed Senator Nickles a chart. From \nthe time that Harry Truman was President until today, going through \nevery President, every President of the United\n\n[[Page S1219]]\n\nStates has created jobs, without exception, except the current \nPresident Bush. In fact, he has done so poorly in job creation that he \nhas lost over 2 million jobs.\n  I hope the American people understand we are offering these \namendments because we believe the American people deserve more than tax \ncuts for the rich.\n  The present administration's tax cut plan will increase the deficit \nby almost $1 trillion over 10 years. I hope my friend from Pennsylvania \nwould vote against that if he is concerned about deficits, because that \nis a huge deficit builder.\n  Every time my friend, the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania, \ncomes to the Chamber with his chart, we are going to also talk about \nwhat this administration has done that has adversely affected the \nAmerican people.\n  The amendments offered by the Democrats--which are said to be \n``outrageous things''--fund school districts around America to take \ncare of handicapped children. I know that is somewhat radical that we \nwant to pay for handicapped children to be educated, but that is what \nwe have decided we would like to do, that we would fully fund the IDEA \nprogram. There is not a school district in America that opposes that.\n  Some of the other amendments funded the unfunded mandates that have \ntaken place with our passing the homeland security bill. I know the \nState of Nevada badly needs that money because we have been forced to \ndo things that the Federal Government has passed on to us that we \ncannot afford to do. The State of Nevada needs help. That is why today \nStates have deficits of about $100 billion.\n  The deficit of the State of California alone is $35 or $40 billion, \nbut of course it has 15 percent of the population of this country.\n  So they can bring out all the charts they want to talk about these \namendments the Democrats are offering. The reason we have voted nearly \nunanimously for every one of these amendments is because it is the \nright thing to do for the people who are not represented by the Gucci \nshoe crowd, the big limousine crowd.\n  My friend from Rhode Island is going to offer an amendment to take \ncare of about a million people who have no unemployment insurance. The \nunemployment rate has increased by millions under this President. It \nhas gone from 4 percent to 6 percent. Job losses, as I have indicated, \nare over 2 million. The private sector has lost 2.4 million jobs since \nPresident Bush took office. Unemployment is staggering. A total of \nalmost 9 million people were unemployed in December. The length of \nunemployment, which is more than 26 weeks, increased by 122,000 in \nDecember alone, the biggest 1-month increase in a long time.\n\n  There are a great deal of problems with this economy. We believe \nthere should be a tax plan to stimulate the economy. What we believe \nshould take place is an immediate tax cut. It should be directed toward \nthe middle class. It should have no long-term impact on the deficit in \nthis country.\n  I talked earlier about the Bush economic record. It is the only \nadministration to lose private jobs in more than 50 years. We have had \nno other administration that has not created jobs. His dad came close. \nHe almost was in the negative. He was the lowest we had since \nEisenhower. But it is topped by this President. Eisenhower created \nincreased employment by one-half of 1 percent, Kennedy by 2 percent, \nJohnson by 3.6 percent, Nixon by 2.1 percent, Ford by .18 percent, \nCarter by 3.3 percent, Reagan by 2.3 percent, George H.W. Bush by .4 \npercent, Clinton by 2.6 percent; George W. Bush has lost jobs. He is \nthe only president whose job creation is in the negative.\n  We do not need people to lecture us on how bad the Democratic \namendments are. Our amendments are targeted toward American people, not \ntargeted toward the rich.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from North Dakota is now recognized for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, may I ask the Senator from Nevada a \nquestion about what he just stated?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to maintain the floor and yield to my friend \nfrom Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Nevada, what \nconfuses me about what the Senator from Pennsylvania said, and others \nhave said, and is disturbing, our friends on the other side of the \naisle have an incredible definition of what constitutes security. The \nidea that we would at this moment cut the end strength of the U.S. \nmilitary, there would be 100 out of 100 Senators in opposition on the \nfloor.\n  The idea that we are like those soccer moms we talk so much about, \nthey are no longer soccer moms, I suggest. They are security moms. They \nare literally worried about whether or not in their children's \nschoolyard, in their shopping center, in their daily routine, they and/\nor their family might be a victim of terrorism.\n  If this war is a war the President talks so much about, with good \nreason, a war on terror, I assume we are saying the same thing. A war \non terror is not a war that is only being conducted by special forces \noverseas, but the war on terror is in the United States.\n  What is the greatest concern Americans have? It is that something is \ngoing to happen as happened on September 11.\n  I ask this of these friends of ours on the other side of the aisle. I \nthink they mean well. They talk about the fact they do not want to grow \ngovernment. I ask, How are you going to combat terror in the United \nStates of America, in Washington, DC; in Omaha, NE; in Wilmington, DE; \nin San Francisco, CA; how are you going to confront terror, combat \nterror? How are you going to make our nuclear powerplant that is right \nacross the river from tens of thousands of Delawareans secure? How are \nyou going to make sure there are no Americans subject to poison gas \nattacks, the water supply being polluted, chemical agents, or, God \nforbid, biological weapons. The only way to do that, it seems to me, is \nwith more defense.\n\n  What is the defense? That is homeland defense. The defense is the \nFBI, local law enforcement; the defense is domestic surveillance, \ndomestic operations. My friends keep saying they do not want to grow \ngovernment. What the devil are they talking about? They just cut 1,100 \nFBI agents. They shrank government. If tomorrow they took this similar \npercentage of U.S. Marines and cut them, we would say: My God, what are \nthey doing? They are crazy.\n  A U.S. marine, I ask my friend from Nevada, who is going to confront \na terrorist on the Mall in Washington, DC, or at a nuclear powerplant \nin Nevada or Delaware, who will confront that person? Who will track \nthem down? Is it a marine? A special forces person? No, it is going to \nbe a law enforcement officer.\n  These fellows have, unintentionally, I hope, emasculated law \nenforcement. They have cut the COPS Program that put 100,000 cops on \nthe street. They eliminated that. They transferred, necessarily, 570-\nsome FBI agents out of violent crime strike forces toward terror. They \nhave reduced the coverage in the States. They have now cut another \nroughly 1,100 FBI agents, eliminated any help for local law \nenforcement. They ballooned--as a consequence of that, in part--the \nbudget of all these States, and they proudly stand here and say: We are \nnot going to grow government.\n  I raise my hand; I want to grow government to fight terror. I want to \ngrow the number of FBI agents. I want to grow the number of CIA agents. \nI want to grow the number of police officers. I want to grow the \nability to defend my family from a terrorist attack on a nuclear \npowerplant in my region, all of which are exposed now. They are \nexposed.\n  I hope my friends, when they come to the floor, will explain to me \nwhy an increase in the deficit to maintain the end strength of the FBI \nis less worthy than increasing the deficit over 10 years by half a \nbillion, counting interest, to give people a deduction, no taxes, on \ntheir dividends.\n  Mr. REID. If I could respond to my friend, the distinguished Senator, \nformally chairman of the Judiciary Committee and Foreign Relations \nCommittee, the only place the Senator has misspoken is that the tax cut \nwill be near $1 trillion when interest is included, near $1 trillion.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I was only talking about the dividends.\n  Mr. REID. And I say to my friend, the Senator is absolutely right.\n\n[[Page S1220]]\n\n  We have to have a secure nation. The amendments we have supported and \nwere offered by Senator Byrd are amendments that would give the State \nof Delaware, the State of North Dakota, and the State of Nevada, a \nlittle bit of relief from the unfunded mandates we passed on.\n  I also remind my friend from Pennsylvania who was talking about how \nbad the amendments were; he talked a lot about the deficit. We are not \ntalking as ``pie in the sky.'' We, as Democrats, have a ledger you can \nlook to of success. For the first time in modern history, during the \nClinton years, we were spending less money than we were taking in. The \nlast year of the Clinton administration, they were coming to us saying: \nBetter not retire that debt so quickly because you could have an \nadverse effect on the economy. I guess someone in the Bush \nadministration heard that because they listened clearly. Instead of \nhaving a surplus, as we had, they have gone gang busters.\n  Mr. BIDEN. If the Senator will yield briefly--and I will yield the \nfloor--I appreciate the response.\n  I have no doubt and I do not disagree with anything the Senator has \nsaid overall, but I am just suggesting that I wonder how any Members \nwill explain at home, if, God forbid, one of our nuclear powerplants is \nblown up; if, God forbid, sarin gas is released in the tunnels under \nNew York City; if, God forbid, any number of other things I could \nmention, which I won't because they will frighten people, happen, I \nwonder how any Member will explain how we justified, in the name of not \ngrowing government, reducing the number of what I call domestic defense \nofficials, the number of FBI agents, the law enforcement agents, the \nnumber of people who, in fact, have as their primary responsibility, \nthe security of our people. A government's first and foremost \nresponsibility is security. It is not tax equity, it is security. \nSecurity. I am here to say we are skating perilously close to a \ndisaster line here for failing to step up to the plate.\n\n  My last comment is I made a speech on September 10 to the National \nPress Club making the same argument I am making now. It was at that \ntime thought to be somehow a little bit of--we can't afford it. The \nargument I made on September 10 at the National Press Club was we were \nignoring domestic security and international terror at our peril and I \nlaid out what we were not doing.\n  Let me say to you, I will be back on the floor again and again \nbecause I do not want my children or my grandchildren saying to me: \nWhere were you during the war, daddy? Put it another way: Where were \nyou when we were fighting terrorism, or supposed to be fighting \nterrorism? Why were you cutting law enforcement, cutting the FBI? Why \nwere you cutting the very agencies that were designed to protect our \nsecurity, that mom in her living room, her child in her school, her \nhusband on the subway? Where were you?\n  I think we are misguided, in terms of the majority view on this \nfloor. I want to grow government to defeat terror. I want to do it with \npeople with guns. I want to do it with people with might. I want to do \nit with people with intelligence capability. I want to stop it before \nit happens. You cannot convince me you can do a better job with fewer \npeople.\n  I thank my friend.\n  Mr. REID. I have a unanimous consent request, if my friend will \nyield.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senators Reed of Rhode Island, Clinton, \nBingaman, Johnson, and Schumer be added as cosponsors to the Dodd \namendment No. 71.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota is recognized under the previous order \nfor 15 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I came to the floor because I want to talk \nabout an amendment that will be offered tomorrow dealing with disaster \naid for farmers, but I can't help but comment just a moment on some of \nthe discussion I heard on the floor as I entered the Chamber, and also \njust prior to that, the notion there is one side of this Chamber that \nsomehow is for big government and there is the other side that is \nprotecting the American people against big government.\n  My colleague from Delaware said it appropriately. If you take a look \nat the amendments that have been offered and debated, the amendments, \nfor example, by my colleague, Senator Byrd, are talking about \nadditional investments in homeland security. Does anyone really think \nit is just building big government to care about investments in \nhomeland security?\n  Do you know, for example, that there are 5.7 million containers that \ncome into America's ports every single year and only 100,000 of them \nare inspected and 5.6 million containers are not inspected? Do you \nthink maybe we ought to do better than that? Do you think there is a \npotential threat by terrorists dealing with our ports and harbors and \nthe containers that are coming in from all parts of the world?\n  If you do, do you really want to stand up and say what my colleague \nis trying to do is just big government? Or maybe you want to stand up \nand say this is an important investment in the security of this \ncountry. Maybe you want to stop the kind of demagoguery that exists \naround this town at almost every turn on almost every subject.\n\n  Isn't there a reason to have a thoughtful debate about what kind of \nsecurity the American people expect and deserve, responding to the \nterrorist threat around the world? I think it ought to be thoughtful \nrather than thoughtless, and too much of the dialog I find, \nregrettably, is thoughtless.\n  We have heard, of course, the same dissenting voices. When the \nproposal was to create a Medicare program, the dissenting voices were \nto say: Oh, no, we can't do that. Create a Social Security Program to \nhelp seniors? No, we can't do that.\n  It's a good thing this Chamber wasn't filled with people with that \nattitude when President Eisenhower proposed we build the interstate \nhighway system or that wouldn't have gotten built.\n  I won't go on. I will just say I don't think anyone in here pines for \n``big government.'' But I think we want a better country. And some of \nus very strongly believe that to have a better country is to decide to \ninvest in America's kids, to improve education, to make our \nneighborhoods safe, to create the kind of circumstances in which we \nhave economic growth and opportunity, and people have decent jobs--jobs \nthat pay well, jobs that have security. All of these represent what \nwill make this a better country--not a bigger government, a better \ncountry. I think we would be well advised to redraw a few of these \ncharts that we see brought to the floor of the Senate and talk about \nwhat is important to the future of America instead of trading slogans \nback and forth.\n  But that is not why I came to the floor. I want to talk just for a \nmoment about the issue of disaster aid for family farmers. Last week a \ncattle rancher from western North Dakota called and said: I don't want \nany political discussion or political talk. What I need to know is, \nwill there be some assistance for those of us who have been hit by \ndisaster? Because I just spent 2 hours at my local bank. The fact is, \nif there is not disaster aid made available by the Congress to help \nthose of us who got hit by a natural disaster--a drought that has been \ndevastating for them--then I am not going to be able to continue. There \nwill not be any credit for the coming year and I am not going to be \nable to continue on my ranch.\n  There are thousands, tens of thousands of people all across this \ncountry in exactly the same situation, wondering if, during this \ndisaster, this devastating drought that has been likened in some parts \nof our country to the Dust Bowl days of the 1930s--a devastating \ndrought that is not the fault of farmers and ranchers but that has \ncrippled their ability to make a living, devastated their livestock \nherds and meant that seeds they planted in the spring could not \npossibly produce the harvest in the fall--wondering whether, as has \nalways been the case, whether Congress will do in this disaster what it \nhas done in previous disasters, and that is say to those farm families: \nWe would like to extend a helping hand.\n  We do that in virtually every other circumstance. When there is a \nhurricane in one of our southern States, when there is a fire or a \nflood or an earthquake, our country is quick to send teams of people \nand say: Let us help you. This is a natural disaster. It is not of your \nmaking and we understand the need for our country to reach out and \nextend a hand and say let us help you.\n\n[[Page S1221]]\n\n  I have always been pleased to say let me be a part of that. I want to \nhelp the people who have been hit hard by these devastating natural \ndisasters. So my vote has always been yes. My colleagues, fortunately, \nhave always said the same when it comes to disasters that hit the \nfamily farm. The question is whether we will provide enough help to \nallow them to continue on that family farm or ranch.\n  We are going to offer, tomorrow morning, I believe--at least it will \nbe tomorrow, I hope it will be the first amendment up--Senator Daschle, \nmyself, Senator Baucus, and others will offer a farm disaster package \nhere on the floor of the Senate and that package will be similar to \nthat which has been offered in the Senate previously and passed by the \nSenate previously, $5.9 to $6 billion. It received a very wide margin \nhere in the Senate. The vote was bipartisan. It was declared emergency \nspending, as has always been the case with respect to disaster relief. \nAnd it was blocked. It was blocked by the House; blocked by the White \nHouse. But nonetheless, blocked.\n  We passed disaster relief on three occasions in the last Congress, \nonly to see it blocked, and we were unable, then, to get this disaster \nrelief made available to family farmers across the country.\n  So, we will try again tomorrow, urging that the Congress pass \ndisaster relief. We could and should be able to do that in the Senate. \nI am reading there are some others with a disaster proposal that is \nless than half of what should be available and also providing that \nthose who had no disaster will get payments. Last week's construct was \na bit different from this week's. But what I read is we will still see, \nunder the proposal offered by the majority, a disaster relief proposal \nthat will spread money to those in rural America, notwithstanding who \nmight or might not have been hit with a disaster.\n  It is our proposition that only those who have need--incidentally, it \nis a wide group of family farmers and ranchers across this country who \nhave been hit by this devastating drought--it is only those, in my \njudgment, who should receive the benefit of the disaster program.\n  We passed a new farm program last year that would provide better \nprice supports and that would guard against falling prices. But this \nisn't about price support. This is about disaster.\n  In my part of the country, a fair portion of the crops--particularly \nin southern North Dakota--never got out of the ground. In parts of \nNorth Dakota and in parts of much larger areas of the country, if you \nsaw a picture of the ground that you would have taken during what would \nhave been harvesttime, you would see something that looked very much \nlike a moonscape. The seeds were in the ground but the seeds did not \ncome up. That farmer and his or her spouse would have lost everything. \nMany of them right now are visiting with their bankers to determine \nwhether they will be able to continue on the farm or ranch.\n  I hope this Congress is ready to say, as it did last year in the \nSenate, that we believe we ought to provide a disaster package to \nfamily farmers who suffered this drought disaster.\n  There are many strikes that are against farmers and ranchers--some \nperpetrated by the Congress and some by others, one of which is trade, \nfor example. I will not spend much time talking about that. But our \nfarmers have been beset these years by low prices, by bad trade deals, \nand by a range of disasters--in some cases too much moisture, and in \nother cases too dry, but the result is the same. In both cases, their \nlivestock herds are decimated. They are unable to raise a crop.\n  My hope is that by tomorrow we will have sufficient numbers in the \nSenate, as we have had on previous occasions in the last year and a \nhalf, who will stand up for family farmers and ranchers and decide \nthey, too, will support, as they have in the past, disaster relief. My \nhope is that by this time tomorrow we will have had the debate, \nfinished the debate, and had a favorable vote. Senator Daschle and I, \nand Senator Baucus and others, have spoken on the floor previously.\n  Senator Baucus put this in the stimulus plan last year and Senator \nDaschle was in the Chamber leading the effort. We have had plenty of \ndebate on it. It ought not be a mystery for any Member in this Senate \nabout what is happening in rural America. No one, in my judgment, need \nask the question, including the President of the United States--who, \nincidentally, went to South Dakota so often last year that he should \nhave rented an apartment in South Dakota, and he came to North Dakota. \nAnd within the last couple of years, he has said, oh, by the way, you \nfamily farmers, when you need me, I will be with you. We needed him and \nhe wasn't with us--last year and now this year. We asked this President \nto join us. We asked the Speaker of the House to join us and help us \npass disaster relief at this point.\n  That is why beginning tomorrow Senator Daschle, myself, and others \nwill be pushing for an amendment on this omnibus bill. I know there \nwill be those who will come to the floor--and perhaps one of my \ncolleagues who spoke earlier today--and say, well, what they are \ntalking about is big government. What we are talking about is trying to \nstimulate the economy and help those in the country who need some help. \nOne quick way to stimulate the economy in rural America is to help \nthose farmers and ranchers with some disaster relief, as we have always \ndone in the past. That disaster relief finds its way into the \nmainstream. It supports jobs and main streets and businesses in all of \nour communities in rural America.\n  It is not just about family farmers. It is about the world economy. \nIt is about stimulating our economy. There is no more quick way to do \nthat than to include in any stimulus package--in this case to include \nin the omnibus bill--a piece of legislation that does what Congress \nshould have done a year ago but failed to do because the Speaker of the \nHouse and the President blocked it; that is, pass a decent disaster \nrelief bill in the neighborhood of $6 billion on an emergency basis \nthat no longer leaves America's food producers in doubt; that says to \nthose families who are struggling on the farms that we are with you, we \ncare about you, but when you suffer disaster this country is going to \nextend its hand to you.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nRhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following \nthe remarks Senator Reed I be recognized for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I have spoken \nto the floor staff. Following the statement of Senator Voinovich, \nSenator Durbin wishes to speak on the amendment that Senator Reed is \ngoing to offer.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, it is my \nunderstanding that Senator Reed may speak for 10 minutes. Is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. REED. No.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has no limit.\n  Mr. DURBIN. All right. I ask unanimous consent that follow his \nremarks I be recognized for brief comments on the same subject. But I \nwill wait. I think that is appropriate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I have to preside at 4 o'clock. May I \nask unanimous consent to be recognized to speak at 5 o'clock after I am \nfinished presiding?\n  Mr. REID. I think that will be just fine. We will have no objection.\n  Mr. REED. I have no objection. I think I can assure the Senator that \nI will be finished before 4 o'clock.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, may I inquire of the assistant \nDemocratic leader, when will we get a unanimous consent on the African \nfamine amendment?\n  Mr. REID. I have spoken to the majority. They recognize that the next \namendment we want to offer is by the Senator from Florida. We \nunderstand that Senator Inhofe will be ready to go also. I am sure we \nwill get that consent as soon as the debate on unemployment insurance \nis completed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Hearing no objection, the unanimous consent \nrequest of the Senator from Ohio is agreed to. The Senator will follow \nthe Senator from Rhode Island.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 40\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, under the unanimous consent, I call up \namendment No. 40.\n\n[[Page S1222]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today I join with Senator Durbin and several \nother of my colleagues in calling for an extension of Federal \nunemployment benefits for the 1 million long-term unemployed workers \nwho have exhausted their benefits and were not aided by the legislation \nthat we passed on January 8.\n  On January 8, we passed a bill that extended benefits to unemployed \nworkers who were cut off from receiving their benefits on December 28. \nWith the December 28th deadline, approximately 800,000 workers were cut \noff from receiving their benefits. We essentially gave them 13 weeks of \nextended benefits, but in doing so we neglected to provide additional \nbenefits for a million Americans who lost their unemployment benefits--\nfirst, their State benefits of 26 weeks, and then their extended \nFederal unemployment benefits.\n  In recent recessions, Congress always acted to respond to the plight \nof these unemployed Americans who are searching for work, trying to \nmaintain their households, and trying to maintain their families. In \nthe early 1990s, Congress extended benefits five different times--three \nof those times during the Presidency of President George Herbert Walker \nBush.\n  In contrast to the 1990s, the situation is even greater today. At the \nend of December 2002, an estimated 2.2 million workers exhausted their \nFederal benefits; whereas, in the recession of the 1990s, approximately \n1.4 million Americans had exhausted those benefits.\n  Where is this crisis affecting Americans? It is everywhere. It is \nestimated that of these 1 million jobless Americans, about 56,800 are \nfrom Texas; 44,000 are from Pennsylvania; 43,500 are from Ohio; 37,600 \nare from North Carolina; 53,000 are from Illinois; 20,000 are from \nIndiana; 27,000 are from Tennessee; 18,000 are from South Carolina; and \n84,000 are from New York. And the list goes on and on.\n  This is not a rollcall to be proud of because it represents the fact \nthat the economy is not working. These are not small numbers. We \noverlooked a lot of those Americans when we took partial action on \nJanuary 8.\n  This is not just about numbers. This is about people.\n  I think there is an erroneous perception that somehow these people \nare not looking hard enough for work; that they are really the hard-\ncore unemployed, transient workers; that somehow they just don't \ndeserve our help. Nothing could be further from the truth.\n  I will share some stories that have appeared in the press about \npeople who are struggling with this dilemma of unemployment. I think \nyou will find these people are very similar to people in your \nneighborhoods, in your families. They are Americans who want to work \nbut in this economy cannot find work.\n  And there is something else that is going on here, too. This economic \ndilemma has some characteristics of a cyclical unemployment cycle, but \nmany economists believe there are structural issues at work. You see, \nthis is the situation where, for the first time in recent memory, many \nof these unemployed Americans are highly skilled, highly educated, and \nhighly motivated. Yet they cannot find work.\n  For example, Laura Carson of Easton, MA, lost her job in July of \n2001. She was a human resources executive. She worked for approximately \n17 years,\n\n[[Page S1223]]\n\nsince she graduated from Suffolk University. She has applied for \nunemployment insurance. She exhausted her State benefits, and then she \nexhausted her extended benefits. She is still looking. She tried to get \na job this holiday season in a retail shop, but she could not find \nwork. She is still looking. Just to survive, she has gone ahead and \nrefinanced her house and taken out a home equity loan. But that is only \nputting off the inevitable, as bills keep crashing in upon her.\n  These are the types of people we are trying to help: Susan Brown of \nChappaqua, NY, lost her job as a consultant 18 months ago. She used to \nbe a principal in a firm that specialized in Web design. She is one of \nthe victims of this technological bubble that burst. Her company went \nbelly-up in 2001.\n  This is a woman who has worked for 18 years since she got out of \ncollege. She worked through high school and put herself through \ncollege. This is exactly what we like to reward in America: hard work, \ndiscipline, and dedication. She got remarried over the summer and, \nironically--but in this market, not surprisingly--her husband lost his \njob, also. She has had to dip into her 401(k) plan to make ends meet. \nShe is still looking but still very frustrated about finding work. She \nsaid:\n\n       There are just no jobs. I can't even tell you how hard it \n     is.\n\n  And prior to her loss of employment, she was making $200,000 a year. \nThis is an example of this new phenomenon where highly skilled, highly \nmotivated, highly educated people just can't find comparable employment \nin this recession.\n  Jules Berman of Queens was laid off from his job. He worked for \nalmost 30 years for a New York candy company. He filed for unemployment \ninsurance in December 2001, and he has seen his benefits exhausted. He \nhas never been out of work before in his entire work life.\n  What you are seeing, again, if you do the math: after 30 years, \nseeing middle-aged men and women, who are losing their jobs for the \nfirst time in their work history, who thought--as we all did, our \ncontemporaries--if you worked hard, got a good education, got in with a \ngood company and strived and struggled each day, you certainly could \nwork until you retired on your pension and your Social Security. That \nis not the case. And now, at the age of 50, with mortgages, with \nchildren who are going to college, with health care bills and health \ncare concerns, they are looking for a job.\n\n  That is the reality, and it is not just in the Northeast. Eric \nStrubble lives in Newcastle, CA. He was laid off from Hewlett-Packard--\nanother example of the huge downturn in technology companies that has \ntaken place in the last few years. He has filled the gap with these \nunemployment benefits, but, as he said:\n\n       Obviously, if we had to live off it, there would be no way, \n     but it helps stretch things out a bit.\n\n  People don't get unemployment insurance because they don't want to \nwork. It is a fraction of what you make in your salary check each week. \nThe average unemployment benefit is about $256. It does not make up for \nyour lost wages. It allows you, as Mr. Strubble says, to ``stretch \nthings out a bit'' until you get on your feet.\n  Joyce Smith, 52, of Ardmore, TN, exhausted her $190-a-week benefit in \nAugust. She was a factory worker. As she said:\n\n       There's not much out there. They don't want people my age. \n     It's been a panic and a struggle, and you just go into a \n     depression.\n\n  Gary Hineman of Morgantown, PA, an unemployed steelworker who is 48 \nyears old, has worked his whole life. In fact, he fibbed about his age \nat 16 just to get in the Steelworkers Union. He worked all his life, \nworked hard, and yet he is looking desperately for work. He said:\n\n       If I could speak to Members of Congress, I would tell them \n     to see how we live and how we feel. They want the economy to \n     pick up, but there are no jobs to pick it up with.\n\n  That is Mr. Hineman. His wife Michelle works as a grocery clerk. They \nare getting by on her $15-an-hour job.\n  Mr. Hineman said: ``That is the only thing I've got going for me.'' \nThese are examples. These are the realities. These are the people we \nare trying to help and we should help: hard-working Americans. Yet we \nneglected 1 million of them.\n  Now, as the comments of these individuals suggest, this is a \nreflection of an economy that is not working. For the first time in 8 \nyears, family incomes have fallen; poverty is increasing; families at \nall income levels are losing their health insurance; gross domestic \nproduct is growing, but it is not growing fast enough to make up the \njobs that are necessary so these people can get back to work.\n  Indeed, the reality for most Americans today is, they live on their \npaychecks not their portfolios. When the paycheck stops, they are in \nvery difficult circumstances. Our proposal is very simple: Let's give \nthese individuals some more extended unemployment benefits so they can \nstretch it out a bit longer, find that job, make decisions that are \ngoing to get them back in the workforce.\n  Let me point out that our economy has lost over 2.2 million private \npayroll jobs since President Bush took office. The unemployment rate is \ncurrently 6 percent--nearly 2 percentage points higher than when \nPresident Bush took office. Long-term unemployment is very high, and \nthat is the issue we are dealing with in this amendment: giving some \nsupport to these long-term unemployed.\n  By the way, I cannot think of a more efficient stimulus program than \ngiving people looking for work unemployment benefits to tide them over \nuntil they find work. The money goes directly to them and directly into \nthe economy. So from the standpoint of economic policy, that makes \nsense. Certainly from the standpoint of helping citizens of this \ncountry, it makes a great deal of sense.\n\n  The unemployment insurance trust fund has a $24 billion surplus. The \nfunds are there. We should access them and allow these individuals \nadditional benefits. We have to do more to help working Americans to \nmake sure they make it through a very difficult, very challenging \neconomic situation.\n  We have done it before, and I hope we can do it again. I hope we will \ndo it again in this bill. This is an issue of great concern for our \neconomy, but, as I have tried to illustrate with these individual \nstories, this is about our neighbors, people we live with back in our \nhome States, the people we represent, the people who have worked all \ntheir lives; and all they want is a chance to keep their heads above \nwater until they can find that job, as they look for that job day in \nand day out.\n  I think it is the least we can do for them. I hope we will do it. I \nam pleased and proud to be joined by Senator Durbin as a cosponsor. I \nknow he will return a bit later to make his comments.\n  I hope we can, in fact, take up this amendment, adopt it on a strong \nbipartisan basis, and make sure that all long-term unemployed, not just \nthose who were satisfied in the last legislation--but all the long-term \nunemployed--get a chance for extended benefits.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 86\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the \nproposed amendment to stop the New Source Review reforms from moving \nforward, and in support of Senator Inhofe's second-degree amendment. I \nam pleased to have an opportunity to speak about this because there is \na lot of confusion among our colleagues and throughout the country over \nwhat NSR New Source Review--means. The program is a policy that is in \ndesperate need of reform. Reform is critical to public health and the \nenvironment, to our Nation's economy and energy supply, and to the \nsafety of our country's workforce.\n  The program was created back in 1977. It simply requires new \nfacilities to install the ``best demonstrated technology'' to control \nemissions. The program also requires older facilities to update their \nequipment to ``state of the art'' when they do major modifications. I \nunderscore ``major modifications.''\n  When the NSR program was created 26 years ago, Congress believed that \nincorporating pollution controls whenever new facilities are built or \nwhen older ones are significantly modified was the most efficient way \nof controlling pollution. The EPA issued their first NSR regulation, a \n20-page document, in 1980. This implementing regulation excluded from \nthe definition of\n\n[[Page S1224]]\n\nmodification ``routine maintenance, repair and replacement.'' Since \nthen, the EPA has produced over 4,000 pages of guidance documents in an \nattempt to explain and reinterpret the regulations. I say ``attempt'' \nbecause in fact the guidance documents are very confusing.\n  It is important for the public and Members of this body to understand \nthat the lawsuits blossoming all over the United States for NSR \nviolations were brought about by an EPA guidance document, not new \nregulations, an EPA guidance document in 1998 which changed the \ndefinition of routine maintenance. This continual reinterpretation has \nled to confusion, misunderstanding by the EPA, the States, and the \nindustries affected by the regulations.\n  This chart, which I have used at hearings before the Government \nAffairs and EPW Committees, shows why companies are reluctant to \nsubject themselves to New Source Review permits. If you were a company \nand you were going to do routine maintenance and repair, would you ever \nsubmit yourself to this maze? I am sorry it is in such small print \nbecause my colleagues can't see it. But this is the kind of thing they \nare being required to do if they want to go forward with routine \nmaintenance and repair.\n  Not only has the situation led to costly litigation, but to a climate \nof uncertainty, forcing companies to forgo needed maintenance and \nrepair work until the regulatory policies are clarified. Ironically, \nthis uncertainty has led companies to reduce their investments in \ncleaner, less polluting technologies for fear that the shifting \nregulatory environment would declare such improvements a violation.\n  While the goal of the Clean Air Act has been to make the air cleaner, \nthe NSR program has at times worked against this goal and wound up \nhaving the opposite effect.\n  I want to clarify a very important point often misconstrued by the \nopponents of NSR reform. All major facilities are regulated by the \nClean Air Act. No plants are exempt from the Act, and no plants are \n``grandfathered.'' All facilities have permit levels that they must \nmeet for their emissions. They must abide by ozone and particulate \nmatter standards, what we refer to as maximum achievable control \ntechnology standards, the acid rain program, the NOX SIP \nCall, the regional haze program, and a range of other regulatory \nprograms that apply to each industry or facility. Furthermore, states \nimplement source-specific emission limits through state implementation \nplans that can be set at more stringent emissions levels if the states \ndeem it necessary.\n  In fact, as this chart shows, the Clean Air Act has been extremely \nsuccessful in reducing emissions of pollutants. Since the 1970s, \nemissions of all criteria pollutants--carbon monoxide, lead, \nparticulate matter, nitrogen oxide, ozone, and sulfur dioxide--have \nbeen reduced by 29 percent. This is significant when you consider the \nfact that over the past 30 years, our population has increased by 38 \npercent, our Nation's energy consumption has increased by 45 percent, \nthe number of miles our vehicles travel each year has increased by 143 \npercent, and our gross domestic product has increased by 160 percent.\n\n  While our country has grown, emissions have decreased. However, I \nstrongly believe that more can and should be done.\n  I have worked tirelessly over my entire career to improve our \nnation's and Ohio's air quality. In the 1970s, as Mayor of Cleveland, I \nworked on this issue firsthand by operating a 57 megawatt municipally \nowned utility. I also spent considerable effort as Governor to get 28 \nof Ohio's counties into attainment for ozone. Through my efforts to \ninstitute an automobile emissions testing program and convince one of \nour major coal fired facilities to install a scrubber, all 88 of Ohio's \ncounties met the air quality standard requirements of the Clean Air Act \nby the time I left office.\n  I have continued this work here in the Senate since 1999. As chairman \nof the Clean Air Subcommittee, I have been working to further reduce \npollution from power plants through a multi-emissions strategy. Last \nyear, we worked on this issue in the EPW Committee. Unfortunately, the \nmajority moved ahead on a proposal that would have been unjustifiably \ndevastating to our economy and very costly for consumers and businesses \nalike.\n  In the 108th Congress, I plan to work to craft a bipartisan multi-\nemissions strategy that makes real reductions possible right away. I \nurge my colleagues to lay politics aside and work with me to improve \npublic health, protect our environment, provide better regulatory \ncertainty, and ensure continued access to safe, reliable, and low-cost \nelectricity.\n  Mr. President, the NSR program plays an important role in reducing \npower plant emissions. It also--this is something that is not well \nunderstood--applies to every stationary source in the country. When \npeople talk about this, they think it is just utilities that are \ninvolved. Rather, we are talking about refineries, chemical plants, and \nmanufacturing facilities. NSR applies to all of them, and all of them \nout there today are uncertain about what they should be doing and, as a \nresult, are doing nothing.\n  The current confusion over NSR is actually contributing to polluting \nour air. When NSR is clarified, I am sure that many of these companies \nwould move on with their programs. They would reduce emissions, and \nthey would make their facilities more efficient.\n  It is imperative that the NSR program be reformed if we are to \nimprove air quality because at present companies either can't or won't \nmake the necessary changes to improve efficiency and the environment. \nWithout NSR reform, multi-emissions legislation will not work.\n  We need to do everything possible to encourage new investments in \nmore efficient equipment that produces fewer noxious emissions. That is \nwhy Senator Conrad and I, along with 24 of our colleagues, sent a \nbipartisan letter to Administrator Whitman in May calling on her to \n``complete the [NSR] review and to undertake the necessary regulatory \nprocess in the near future to clarify and reform the NSR program.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 13, 2002.\n     Hon. Christine Whitman,\n     Administrator, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Administrator Whitman: The Administration's National \n     Energy Policy included a recommendation that the \n     Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) conduct a review of the \n     New Source Review (NSR) program and make recommendations to \n     improve the program. We are writing to urge you to complete \n     that review and to undertake the necessary regulatory process \n     in the near future to clarify and reform the NSR program. We \n     also encourage you to implement any changes in a way that \n     protects human health and the environment while providing \n     regulatory certainty for the electric utility industry and \n     other industries that must comply with the program while \n     providing reliable and affordable electricity to consumers.\n       We have heard of many situations where confusion over the \n     NSR program is having a dampening effect on utilities' \n     willingness to perform energy efficiency and environmental \n     improvement projects. The NSR program needs to be clarified \n     to adequately define the concept of ``routine maintenance'' \n     to avoid the regulatory uncertainty currently facing \n     industry. Such clarification would allow companies to repair \n     their facilities and maintain reliable and safe electric \n     service for consumers and workers without being subject to \n     the threat of federal government lawsuits for allegedly \n     violating vague NSR requirements.\n       Again, we urge EPA to expeditiously proceed with a \n     regulatory process to clarify and reform the NSR program. \n     Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n         Kent Conrad, George V. Voinovich, Mark Dayton, Byron L. \n           Dorgan, Jean Carnahan, Tim Johnson, Zell Miller, \n           Richard Lugar, Chuck Hagel, Arlen Specter, Kit Bond, \n           Thad Cochran, Ben Nighthorse Campbell, Evan Bayh, Sam \n           Brownback, Jim Bunning, Mary Landrieu, Craig Thomas, \n           John Warner, Pete Domenici, Ben Nelson, Larry Craig, \n           Mike Euzi, Mike DeWine, Richard Shelby, Mitch \n           McConnell.\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Our letter was bipartisan, nine Democrats and 17 \nRepublicans, all calling for reform. While I am sure all 26 of us would \nnot necessarily agree on exactly what the reforms should ultimately \nlook like, we did all agree that we ought to get moving with it. We are \nrunning out of time.\n  In our letter to Ms. Whitman we also stated:\n\n\n[[Page S1225]]\n\n\n       We have heard of many situations in which confusion over \n     the NSR program is having a dampening effect on utilities' \n     willingness to perform energy efficiency and environmental \n     improvement projects.\n\n  Mr. President, I'd like to share just one of the examples that I am \naware of. For refiners, I am aware of an incident in which tubes on a \nreboiler furnace failed, resulting in a fire which damaged the \nremaining tubes. New tubes were installed and the unit was back in \nproduction within two weeks. However, they were in violation of NSR due \nto the ``actual-to-potential'' emissions test. If NSR regulations were \nfollowed, the unit should have undergone the permit process, resulting \nin the refinery being out of commission for five to 18 months. I think \nmy colleagues should remember that the next time a refinery closes and \nprices spike.\n  Mr. President, the 26 Senators who signed this letter are not the \nonly ones who think that NSR has prohibited reductions in emissions. \nThis is really important. In August 2001, the National Governors \nAssociation passed a unanimous resolution calling for NSR reform. Their \nresolution states ``New Source Review requirements should be reformed \nto achieve improvements that enhance the environment and increase \nenergy production capacity, while encouraging energy efficiency, fuel \ndiversity, and the use of renewable resources.''\n  Furthermore, according to the National Coal Council study, \ncommissioned by the Clinton administration, if the EPA were to return \nto the pre-1998 NSR definitions, we could generate 40,000 new Megawatts \nof electricity from coal-fired facilities and reduce pollution at the \nsame time.\n  The current NSR program threatens our energy supply due to both \nshort-term and long-term reliability problems. According to the \nDepartment of Energy, electricity demand is projected to grow by 1.8 \npercent per year through 2020. At the same time, no new nuclear plants \nhave been constructed since the 1970s and the number of new coal \nfacilities has declined significantly since the 1980s. Our nation's use \nof coal will continue to increase, resulting in greater demand on our \naging coal facilities. In order to meet the growing electricity demand, \nmore frequent maintenance and repair work will be needed to keep these \ncoal facilities on-line.\n  Another point that needs to be made, which is often overlooked in \nthis debate, is that the costs of NSR are passed on to the ratepayers. \nSomehow people forget that the customer always pays. Too often, the \nenvironment and the ratepayer get lost in the constant duel between \nextremist environmental groups and recalcitrant companies.\n  Higher energy prices will have a more profound effect on low-income \nfamilies and the elderly. The Department of Energy, as this chart \nshows, claims that those individuals or families making less than \n$10,000 per year will spend 29 percent of their income on energy costs, \nand those making between $10,000 and $24,000 a year will spend 13 \npercent of their income on energy costs.\n  The NSR program not only prevents the installation of more efficient \nand less polluting technologies, but it also interferes with safety \nimprovements.\n  According to the Boilermakers Union, ``Maintenance is necessary to \nmaintain worker safety. Electric generating facilities harness \ntremendous forces: superheater tubes exposed to flue gases over 2000 \ndegrees; boilers under deteriorating conditions; and parts located in \nor around boilers subjected to both extreme heat and pressure.''\n\n  Failure to maintain and repair equipment creates a potential danger \nto the lives and safety of the men and women who work on these \nfacilities, and they are not moving forward right now with many of \nthese repairs.\n  Fortunately, the EPA has responded to the bipartisan and strong call \nfor reform of the New Source Review program. On December 31, 2002 the \nEPA published a rule that included five reforms of the program. Some of \nmy colleagues might not know that the final rule was actually proposed \nby the Clinton administration. Let me repeat: These reforms were \nproposed by the Clinton administration. They are bipartisan.\n  The reforms are the result of over 10 years of work by the EPA across \nthree administrations and have involved over 130,000 written comments \nin the last year alone. The EPA has conducted a detailed environmental \nanalysis of the rule and found that the reforms will have a net benefit \nto the environment, a net benefit. They are good for the environment. \nAgain, I want to stress to my colleagues that Senator Inhofe's \namendment will allow us to move forward and help the environment.\n  This morning my colleague from North Carolina proposed an amendment \nto delay the implementation of these reforms for 6 months until a study \nis completed to assess their impact. They have been studied for a long \ntime. On the surface this sounds like a good idea. However, if this \namendment passes, we will delay reforms that have been worked on for \nover 10 years and would make improvements in the environment and to \npublic health today. An EPA analysis already found that the reforms \nwill have a net benefit to the environment.\n  Furthermore, Mr. President, contrary to an argument put forth by \ncritics of NSR reform, EPA has stated publicly that it deliberately \nwrote the rule so that current lawsuits would not be affected by the \nproposed NSR reforms.\n  It is my belief that if this amendment passes, it will also seriously \nharm the prospects of future reforms to the NSR program. For example, \nEPA has proposed a rule to provide a new definition for ``routine \nmaintenance, repair, and replacement.'' The EPA did not offer specifics \nbut asked for public comment on a range of options. This proposal is at \nthe crux of the issue and is imperative. I believe this amendment would \nnot only delay the current rule from being implemented, but it would \nalso effectively delay other very important reforms to the program. We \nhave to get on with it.\n  I join my colleague and friend, Senator Inhofe, today in the second-\ndegree amendment he has proposed. This amendment would allow the \nreforms to be implemented while requiring the National Academy of \nSciences to evaluate its impact. It allows the reforms to go forward to \nstop this state of limbo that exists. At present, nothing is happening. \nCompanies will then be able to make efficiency improvements and reduce \ntheir emissions. At the same time, the Academy can study the impact of \nthe reforms as they are being implemented.\n  Ending the confusion surrounding the NSR reforms will allow companies \nto make the investments that are necessary to both increase our energy \nsupply and environmental protections. We can reduce pollution and \nbecome more energy-efficient. We need to provide both for continued \neconomic development and protections for public health and the \nenvironment. To meet these needs, we must move enact substantive NSR \nreform.\n  I thank the administration for their work in developing this proposal \nand moving ahead with the Clinton era reforms. I urge them to continue \nthese efforts. Support for these actions is strong and broad-based. The \nconfusion about NSR regulations is pervasive throughout our Nation, \nfrom the regulated community to the regulators. It must be addressed--\nand soon.\n  Mr. President, I sincerely urge my colleagues to support Senator \nInhofe's second-degree amendment to Senator Edwards' amendment. The \nprogram is broken and desperately needs to be reformed. We cannot \nafford further delay.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Yes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. First of all, I thank the Senator from Ohio for the time \nhe has spent in setting out this issue. Not many people are aware of \nthe fact that Senator Voinovich was the head of the National Governors \nAssociation Clean Air Committee and has been working on it for a long \ntime.\n  I only add to his comments and ask him if he is in agreement that we \nhave 180 pages here, and almost all of this was done during the Clinton \nadministration. All the data that would be available for the NAS is \nfound in the results that are very positive in this report. So I \ncertainly hope this is an accommodating way for the Senator from North \nCarolina to say, yes, we want the input of the NAS; we don't want to \nwait 6 more months.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Again, I thank the Senator. I emphasize that 130,000 \ncomments were made last year regarding those regulations that have been \nissued by the EPA. So it has been really vetted. People have had an \nopportunity to\n\n[[Page S1226]]\n\nparticipate in this. I support the Senator's suggestion that rather \nthan ask for a study by the Academy, we delay that and let the rules \nbe issued, and then let the Academy look at it. That is a much sounder, \nmore commonsense approach to dealing with this problem.\n\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I am more than happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, would it not be better, rather than having \nthe rule going into effect and having all the people, from our \nperspective, start polluting while the study is taking place, to find \nout which side is right? We are saying to have the NAS study the issue, \nhold this off for 6 months, and then there should be a determination \nmade as to whether the rule as proposed by the administration affects \npeople.\n  I don't see--and I ask my friend from Ohio, the distinguished junior \nSenator--what harm can be done in holding off for 6 months this rule \ngoing into effect when, if we don't hold off, our reasoning would be, \nas indicated in the study I talked about earlier today, where just 2 \nmonths--2 plans would put into the environment 120 tons of bad things \nevery year.\n  Would it not be better to wait and see what the study of the National \nAcademy of Sciences comes up with before the rule went into effect?\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Nevada that \nthe previous administration had been working on these rules. They \nstarted out during the Clinton administration. The Bush administration \nbegan looking at the recommendations from the previous administration. \nThey subjected them to review by many organizations. By the way, these \nrules do not apply to utility companies. They have only proposed a rule \nin this regard. What I am saying to Senator Reid and others is that \nbecause the regulations have not been reformed, companies for several \nyears have done nothing to move forward with installing controls that \nwould reduce emissions or make their facilities more efficient. I think \nwe have delayed long enough. It has been vetted.\n  If someone believes yet another review is necessary, it should be \ndone after the reforms are implemented. Any additional review should be \ndone after implementation so that we are dealing with reality and not \nspeculation. This is very important. I think it is time for us to go \nforward with the reforms to allow facilities to do their routine \nmaintenance and repair work. This will make their facilities more \nefficient, reduce their emissions and, in some cases, produce more \nenergy.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will respond simply to my friend that the \nenvironmental community has a different view. They believe this radical \nrule change would simply allow pollution to take place that is not \nallowed now.\n  We hear that the rules the administration has made are the same as \nrules made in the Clinton administration. This simply isn't true. Here \nis what Carol Browner has said:\n\n       Some have suggested that the administration's announced \n     changes are changes the Clinton administration supported. \n     Nothing could be further from the truth. Fundamental to \n     everything we did was a commitment to ongoing air quality \n     improvements. There is no guarantee, and more importantly, no \n     evidence or disclosure demonstrating that the \n     administration's announced final or proposed changes will \n     make the air cleaner. In fact, they will allow the air to \n     become dirtier.\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, we had a hearing in the EPW committee \nlast year on the rules before they were publicized, and they were \nsavaged because many people believed the issuance would interfere with \ncurrent lawsuits. The EPA claims that the reforms do not interfere with \npending lawsuits for violations under the guidance that was issued back \nin 1998.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 40\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I came to the floor to speak on the Reed-\nDurbin amendment regarding unemployment insurance. If another Senator \nhas been waiting to speak, I will be glad to wait. If not, I will \nproceed.\n  Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment which has been \nintroduced by Jack Reed of Rhode Island and myself. About 20 years ago, \nwhen I first ran for Congress, I waited each month for an economic \nindicator which really led the debate about the state of America's \neconomy. That economic indicator every single month was the \nunemployment rate. If the unemployment rate in America was high, or \ngoing up, that really consumed all of the political attention of \ncandidates and Members of Congress. That was considered to be the \nyardstick or barometer of how healthy America's economy is. In the span \nof time I have served in Congress, that yardstick and barometer has \nchanged.\n  We now focus more on the situation of the Dow Jones Index and \nStandard & Poor's. We look daily, almost on a minute-by-minute basis, \nto the report of the Dow Jones Index as an indicator of our economic \nwell-being. But I think in so doing, we have overlooked something we \nhave done for a long time. If the economy is not strong, people do not \ngo to work. If they do not go to work, they get desperate to keep their \nfamilies together, to pay for the basics, to make sure their kids have \nthe necessities of life, and they struggle to hope that the economy \nreturns to strength and they can return to employment, and soon.\n  There is a lot of talk in this Chamber about who is responsible for \nthis recession. That is a common topic in politics. We politicians \nspend a lot of time pointing fingers, saying: This recession really \nstarted the last few months of the Clinton administration; no, no, it \nreally started in the first few months of President George W. Bush's \nadministration. Let me for a moment push that aside and suggest that \nthe families who lost their jobs do not care. They are not interested \nin when this started. They want to know when it is going to end so that \nif they lost a job and are falling behind, they have a chance to get \nback into the workforce.\n  These are not people who can be characterized as lazy in any way. \nThey have worked, and worked hard, for a long time, but contractions in \nthe American economy because of this recession have killed jobs all \nacross America. During the 8 years of the Clinton administration, we \ncreated 22 million new jobs. During the first 2 years of this \nadministration, we have lost 2 million jobs nationally, and we are \nlosing over 100,000 a month. As a result, many people are hard pressed \nto keep up with their obligations to their family.\n  The December 2002 unemployment rate of 6 percent is the highest rate \nin over 8 years. According to a Congressional Budget Office economic \nforecast, the unemployment rate is expected to remain at that level at \nleast until the second half of this year, 2003.\n  Over 1.85 million workers have been looking for work for at least 6 \nmonths. As of January this year, more than 1 million workers exhausted \nthe 13-week temporary benefits extension enacted in March 2002 and \nremain unemployed. Employment has declined by 1.7 million jobs since \nJanuary of 2001. The decline is slightly worse than the average fall-\noff after the last six recessions. While the unemployment rate remains \nfar lower than at the end of the recessions in the 1980s and 1990s, it \nhas still risen significantly from its 30-year low of 3.9 percent in \n2000, not that long ago.\n  The reason I raise that point and the reason Senator Reed and I come \nto the floor to offer this amendment is to suggest that hundreds of \nthousands, perhaps 1 million, unemployed workers in this country are \nfacing extraordinarily dangerous and difficult times. These are people \nwho are caught up in the vortex of this recession and cannot get out. \nThey cannot find work. They drew unemployment for a short period, and \nit has been exhausted. They used it all up. Now where are they? They \nare stuck in a position where they have to try to meet their monthly \nbills and have no unemployment compensation, no prospects for \nemployment, and the recession seems to be going on interminably.\n  I asked business leaders of major corporations from my State to give \nme their best guess of when this recession would end. Frankly, they \ntold me--and it was depressing to hear--it might be 2 years. I hope \nthey are wrong. I hope it ends tomorrow. I hope we see better signs of \nencouragement. The fact is, it has not happened.\n\n  What have we done in the past when we have dealt with recessions not \neven as bad as this one? We said time and\n\n[[Page S1227]]\n\nagain if the recession continues indefinitely, we have to step in. We \ncannot abandon these Americans who are victims of this economy. Let us \ngive them a helping hand. Let us do something for their families. Let \nus make certain they do not lose their homes to mortgage foreclosures. \nThis is not a Democratic response or a Republican response, it has been \nour American response year in and year out.\n  Let me give an example. During the recession of the early 1990s \nwhich, in many respects, was not as bad as this one, Congress extended \ntemporary unemployment benefits five times. During this recession, we \nhave extended benefits only twice. Of the five times Congress extended \nbenefits in the early 1990s, three were under President Bush's father \nin the recession he faced, and two were under President Clinton when he \ntook office, and the recession had continued.\n  This is not a partisan response we are suggesting today. It is \nunfortunate only two Democratic Senators would offer this. This should \nhave been a bipartisan offering.\n  During the recession of the early 1990s, Congress established the \nEmergency Unemployment Compensation Program which was in place for 30 \nmonths, from November 1991 to April 1994. During this recession, we \nestablished the Temporary Extended Unemployment Compensation Program \nwhich is scheduled to expire at the end of May 2003 and, therefore, \nwould have only been in place for less than 15 months. Here we are with \na recession that is worse and a response that does not measure up to \nhalf of what we did during the last major recession we faced.\n  We passed an extension of unemployment compensation benefits recently \nwhich will provide temporary benefits to some workers. This amendment \nwhich Senator Reed and I proposed will provide assistance for an \nadditional 53,000 workers in my State and 1 million workers nationwide. \nIt will provide 13 weeks of additional benefits. Workers in high \nunemployment States who already receive 26 weeks of benefits will \nreceive an additional 7 weeks of benefits. Thus, the greatest number of \nweeks a worker can receive is 59 weeks, the same as under the extension \nenacted under President Bush's father.\n  The CBO cost estimate, $6.5 billion, is substantial but still \nrepresents only slightly more than a third of the balance in the \nunemployment insurance trust fund, after accounting for the extension \nenacted earlier this month. I think the 5-month extension we enacted \nwas something that was good and it helped a lot of workers, but we \ncannot leave out the 1 million Americans who will not be helped by this \naction taken just a few weeks ago. One million Americans have exhausted \ntheir unemployment benefits and are stuck in a situation--without a job \nin a recession--to which, frankly, we do not see an end. What we are \nasking the Senate to do today on this appropriations bill is to think \nabout those we have left behind. I do not believe it is fair to \ncharacterize the people who are victims of this recession as anything \nless than hard-working Americans caught behind the curve of this \neconomy. I do not care whose responsibility this recession is for this \nmoment. We can argue about that for a long time, but I do feel a \nresponsibility to these workers and their families.\n  In my State, the unemployment rate in November of last year was 6.7 \npercent. This is a 13.6-percent increase from November of the previous \nyear when our rate was 5.9 percent. Our unemployment rate in Illinois \nsadly is tied for third highest in the Nation. Alaska and Oregon are \nhigher. We are tied with the State of Mississippi. If one measures the \nimpact of a recession by the percent change in unemployment rates, this \nrecession has hit my State twice as hard as the recession of the early \n1990s, and as of January 1, 2003, over 53,000 Illinois workers \nexhausted the 13-week temporary benefits extension enacted in March \n2002 and remain unemployed. Each week, 4,000 Illinois workers will \nexhaust their regular State unemployment benefits.\n\n  The President, in his radio address a few weeks ago, said as follows:\n\n       We will not rest until every person in America who wants to \n     work can find a job.\n\n  Thank goodness. That is a pledge every President should make. On \nDecember 28, in another weekly radio address, the President said, and \nthis is right after Christmas and we knew unemployment benefits were \nexpiring:\n\n       One of my first priorities for the new Congress will be an \n     extension of unemployment benefits for Americans who need \n     them.\n\n  The President responded and Congress answered with an extension of \nunemployment benefits that took us close to meeting that pledge, but \nnot close enough for 1 million Americans who were left behind. The \nextension of unemployment benefits that the President proposed and \nsigned excluded 1 million American workers who have been unemployed for \nover 9 months and have exhausted all their temporary Federal benefits \nwithout finding a new job.\n  I have argued in this Chamber today that this is a question of \nfairness and compassion. Let me add parenthetically that it is also a \nstimulus to the economy. The money given to unemployed workers is spent \nalmost immediately to meet the needs of their family. It is not salted \naway, invested, or saved. It is spent for goods and services creating \neconomic activity and jobs in a time when this economy dearly needs \nthat to happen.\n  I hope my colleagues will reconsider this issue and join Senator Reed \nand myself in enacting this amendment.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will ask a quick question. I know my colleague \nreferred to the 1990-1991 recession a couple of three times and alluded \nto: We did it then. Why do we not do it now?\n  Is the Senator aware of the fact that the unemployment rate was 7 \npercent or more, compared to the current level of 6 percent, when we \npassed the Federal unemployment extension in 1990-1991?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator from Oklahoma, I am aware of that \nfact, but I hope he is also aware of the fact that the recession we are \ncurrently in also has some economic indicators that are even more \ntroubling than what we faced in the early 1990s.\n  I say to the Senator in good faith that I sincerely hope this \nrecession ends tomorrow. I do not care what the political consequences \nare for Democrats or Republicans, but I hope the Senator from Oklahoma \nwill concede the recession we are in today is unlike those we have had \nbefore. There is high unemployment. Maybe we have not reached record \nlevels, but there seems to be a resistance to getting this economy \nstarted again. I think that is why we are debating a stimulus and \ngrowth package.\n  I hope the Senator will concede that, though the numbers may not be \nexactly as bad, the depths of this recession and the impacts of the \ncurrent recession are really unique and we should respond to them at \nleast in the way we did before.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I wish to speak on this issue, but my \ncolleague, the chairman of the Finance Committee, was in the Chamber \nprior to my arrival so I will speak after his comments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, first, I think all 100 Senators would \nagree, both from the standpoint of our needs for the future as well as \nwhat we have done in the past, that we all recognize the legitimacy of \nthe Federal Government stepping in to compensate with Federal \nunemployment help when State programs have run out. There is no dispute \nabout that.\n  There is a dispute over when and how much, and the plan we are being \noffered now would be a plan that has been put in place at other times \nbut under much higher rates of unemployment.\n  I hope we do not have higher rates of unemployment, but sometime down \nthe road we will, hopefully not now during this period of time, and it \nseems to me we ought to keep reserve to do what we have other times in \nthe past when we have had higher rates of unemployment than we have \nright now, as opposed to triggering in programs that do much more for \nthe unemployed than we normally do at 6-percent unemployment, let's \nsay, as opposed to 7-percent unemployment.\n\n[[Page S1228]]\n\n  If we were to go the route that is being proposed, then we would be \ndoing more than we normally do at this rate of unemployment we have \nnow. Surely, the people who are proposing what they are proposing \ntoday, as all of us would probably do if there is a higher rate of \nunemployment, would expect the Congress to respond to that. It is not a \nquestion of should we respond; it is a question of a measured response \nand when it triggers in.\n\n  I am not condemning people who say we ought to do more today beyond \nwhat States do, but they are responding in a way that we would normally \nrespond when the unemployment situation would be much more negative \nthan it is right now.\n  I think it is wrong for my colleagues to speak about this recession \nbeing different than other recessions, for two reasons. No. 1, the \ndefinition of a recession is two quarters of negative growth. We had \nthree quarters of negative growth but that negative growth ended \nSeptember 30, 2001. So we have had five quarters now of growth, about \n2\\1/2\\ percent average.\n  Economists are predicting the quarter we are in now for 2003 would be \nabout 3-percent growth, so I do not think it is fair to say we are in \nrecession unless we have a Senator who is making his own definition of \na recession--and he has that right--but I think we should be comparing \napples with apples and not apples with oranges.\n  The second point I make is even if we were just coming out of a \nrecession instead of being five quarters out of a recession--an \nofficial recession as defined by economists--I think we all need to \nremember that historically unemployment as a statistic is a lagging \nindicator. So one would expect other indicators of an improving economy \nto improve before the unemployment figure improved. Consequently, this \nhas to be taken into consideration as help is given to unemployed \npeople.\n  It is quite obvious that a number of my Democratic colleagues seem to \nthink we can never spend enough on unemployment. So I want to review \nwhere we are so the record is straight.\n  Under the regular State unemployment program, workers are entitled to \nas much as 26 weeks of unemployment benefits. Under the temporary \nfederally funded unemployment program enacted last March, those who \nexhaust their regular State benefits can receive up to 13 weeks of \nadditional Federal benefits. In addition, workers in high unemployment \nStates can receive yet another additional 13 weeks. That is a maximum \nof 26 weeks of Federal benefits.\n  So to some, it works out this way: Workers in every State can collect \nup to 39 weeks of benefits, 26 of those being State and 13 Federal. \nWorkers in higher unemployment States can collect up to a whole year of \nunemployment benefits, which means 26 weeks State, 26 weeks Federal.\n  Last year, this temporary program was estimated to cost $11 billion. \nWe are still responding, as we should in a bipartisan way, to this \nunemployment statistic still being relatively high but not as high as \nit has historically been. Earlier this month, in addition to what we \ndid last March, Congress voted to extend these Federal benefits through \nMay of 2003. This extension is estimated to cost $7 billion more. That \nhappens to be a total of $18 billion in federally funded unemployment \nbenefits. According to some of my Democratic colleagues, that still \nseems not to be enough.\n  Through this amendment, I think they are trying to spend an \nadditional $6 billion. The amendment they offered today would change \nthe current law to provide 26 weeks of federally funded benefits in \nevery State, and 33 weeks in high unemployment States. The last time \nCongress provided 33 weeks of benefits, the unemployment rate was well \nover 7 percent. That is why I made the point. If we do this, what are \nwe going to do if unemployment gets up to 7 percent, which I do not \nthink anybody expects it to but suppose it did? The current \nunemployment rate is 6 percent.\n  Now there is something even more troubling. What I have said until \nnow has been done by Congress in the past during certain times of high \nunemployment. More disturbing to me, this amendment changes current law \nto provide a uniform duration of benefits. Most States vary the \nduration of benefits based on the worker's actual employment history. \nVariable duration recognizes the insurance principles inherent in \nunemployment compensation by providing a shorter duration for workers \nwho had a limited amount of work prior to qualifying for the benefits. \nThese workers have paid less unemployment taxes and they have less \nattachment to the workforce.\n  Congress has never provided extended benefits without regard to the \nduration of State benefits. That is a very dramatic departure that this \namendment holds for the future. A uniform duration means some workers \nwill be able to collect more Federal benefits than they would State \nbenefits. Moreover, a uniform duration means some workers will actually \nbe able to collect benefits for a longer period of time than they \nactually worked.\n  Current law requires a minimum of 20 weeks of work to qualify for \nFederal benefit. Yet this amendment provides up to 33 weeks of \nbenefits. These 33 weeks of Federal benefits could be paid in addition \nto as much as 39 weeks of State benefits. That happens to be a total of \n72 weeks of benefits for someone who maybe only worked 20 weeks. This \namendment represents the single largest expansion of Federal \nunemployment benefits in the entire history.\n  That brings me to an issue of how, if this were a legitimate approach \nto unemployment compensation, this ought to be handled by committees of \nappropriate jurisdiction, not be offered on the floor of the Senate to \nan appropriations bill. I am speaking because that appropriate \ncommittee is the Senate Finance Committee. We have jurisdiction over \nunemployment compensation. A departure in Federal responsibility is \nvery important to consider as a committee--its impact, its costs. More \nimportant, if we are going to have this sort of an impact that is so \ndifferent from what States have historically had, it ought to be \nconsidered by the committee of appropriate jurisdiction. We are dealing \nwith something that is other than just simple extension of unemployment \ncompensation.\n  Now, we may need to revisit this issue later this year, depending \nupon how the economy performs. But when we do that, we need to do it in \na way that we take into full consideration that this amendment \nrepresents an unprecedented and, at least at this point with 6 percent \nunemployment compared to more than 7\\1/2\\percent unemployment when it \nhas been used in the past, an unjustified expansion of the unemployment \nprogram.\n  I urge my colleagues not to vote for this amendment. I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I compliment my friend and colleague, the \nchairman of the Finance Committee, for his statement. I hope my \ncolleagues pay attention to it, especially the last part. The chairman \nof the Finance Committee said this has not gone through the Finance \nCommittee, and pointed out several things that sounded like this is \nabout what we did in the 1990s, but it is not. It is expensive. This is \na different proposal than what we have seen.\n  We actually had a similar type of proposal that was debated last \nyear, to which I objected, I believe the Senator from Iowa objected, \nand maybe the Senator from New Hampshire objected, that was a doubling \nof the Federal program from 13 to 26 weeks. This is a different \niteration of that. It is different--in some cases maybe better, in some \ncases maybe worse. The one we objected to last year was a $17 or $18 \nbillion program. The proposal now, we understand from the authors--I \nhave not seen this from the Congressional Budget Office, but I respect \nthem and I assume it is correct--says it costs $6.5 billion. Last week, \nwe passed a bill that cost $7.2 billion. So this is $6 billion on top \nof that.\n  The Senator from Iowa mentioned that this says there would be a \nmandatory 26-week Federal unemployment compensation program. Present \nlaw we passed last week is an extension of up to 13 weeks for all \nStates. There is a big difference in legislative language when you say \n``up to'' rather than mandating 26 weeks. One, you are doubling the \nprogram, and you also do not keep it connected to the State program. \nSome States have different durations. We have always been tied to the \nState program.\n\n[[Page S1229]]\n\n  I keep hearing about what we did in 1990; we want to duplicate what \nwe did in 1990. The chairman of the Finance Committee alluded to the \nfact that the 1990 unemployment rate was much higher. It was 7 percent, \n7.4 percent, 7.8 percent. The unemployment rate today nationwide is 6 \npercent. We have a lot of States that are substantially lower. We have \n24 States that have unemployment rates at or below 5 percent this \nyear--now. We have nine States that have unemployment levels between \n2.7 and 4 percent. I remember in my private sector days, if you had \nunemployment at about 4 percent, you might not be able to hire \nsomebody.\n  So there will always be some who are unemployed because people are \nchanging jobs, they just graduated, they just moved and are temporarily \nunemployed. There is always a segment of the population temporarily \nunemployed. Almost half of our States have unemployment rates of 5 \npercent or less.\n  I mentioned there is a big difference from the language we passed in \n1990. In 1990, we did do 26 weeks, but up to 26 weeks. We also had \nunemployment rates that were over a full point higher.\n  Also, sometimes we want to ask: when are we going to pay attention to \nthe committees of jurisdiction? We are on an appropriations bill, yet \nwe have an amendment that expands entitlements. Even though we extended \ncurrent law last week, agreeing to spend an additional $7 billion plus, \ncolleagues say: Wait a minute, let's add another $6.5 billion on top of \nthat. We will just do an amendment that should come out of the Finance \nCommittee right now. This is the first time that people will have seen \nit, and it's different than the proposals we have seen in the past, and \nwe will see if we cannot pass it.\n  It does not belong here. Obviously, my colleagues know the budget \npoint of order lies against this amendment. This proposal has not been \nintroduced as a bill and a committee hearing has not been held, that I \nknow of. Maybe different bills have been introduced. If it is the bill \nSenator Clinton was talking about introducing, this is not the same \nbill. There is a reason we should follow regular order. There is a \nreason we should use the committee of jurisdiction. There is a reason \nwe should have bipartisan cooperation on bills such as this. I am \ndisappointed we are not.\n  In this current recession, we have spent up to $26.25 billion since \nMarch of 2001 to help the unemployed. That is almost what we spent in \nthe 1990s. People say: Well, you are not helping; you do not care about \nthe people. That is hogwash. The proposal introduced today by Senator \nReed and Senator Durbin is not targeted. Twenty-four States have \nunemployment of 5 percent or less, but they will get the same benefits \nas everyone else, except the highest unemployment states get an extra 7 \nweeks.\n  Then we have the dilemma of, right now, the present requirement is a \nperson only has to work 20 weeks and they can receive as much as 52 \nweeks in unemployment compensation. That is not a bad deal, especially \nwhen you consider 72 percent of workers in a household who are eligible \nto receive these benefits have another family member who is employed.\n\n  Think of that: 52 weeks of paid unemployment compensation while in a \nhousehold where, in 72 percent of those households, there is an \nemployed family member.\n  This is a crummy way to legislate. It doesn't belong on this \nappropriations bill. We need to finish this appropriations process. We \nhave 11 bills that were not finished last year. We have already \nfinished one-quarter of this present fiscal year and we haven't passed \nthese bills and we need to complete them. If colleagues want to do a \nchange on unemployment compensation, they should introduce a bill, have \nit referred to an appropriate committee, and ask the chairman for a \nhearing, ask the chairman for a markup. That is the way business is \nsupposed to be done in the Senate. It is not to try to rewrite \nentitlement programs. If you can do unemployment compensation, you can \ndo Medicare, you can do Social Security, you can do any other bill, but \nthat is not following the procedure.\n  Senator Stevens has great expertise, but I doubt that controlling or \nmanaging unemployment compensation is his area of expertise. That is \nnot what his committee does. That belongs properly in the Finance \nCommittee. We need to start respecting committees' jurisdictions and we \nhave not been doing it.\n  I urge my colleagues, let's not be playing games. Let's not be trying \nto pass something they know won't pass and they know it will not come \nout of conference even if they are successful. I don't believe they \nwill be successful. They should not be successful.\n  Mr. President, the pending amendment offered by the Senator from \nRhode Island, Mr. Reed, increases mandatory spend and, if adopted, it \nwould cause an increase in the deficit. Therefore I raise a point of \norder against the amendment pursuant to section 207 of H. Con. Res. 68, \nthe concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2000, as \namended by S. Res. 304.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The assistant legislative clerk resumed the call of the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I renew my request to vitiate the quorum \ncall.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the leaders set \na time for the budget waiver I am going to be suggesting in just a \nsecond. That is part of the unanimous consent request.\n  Therefore, on behalf of Senator Reed of Rhode Island, I move to waive \nthe Budget Act under the requisite rules of the Senate.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Reserving the right to object, and I shall object, \nbecause I think somebody in our conference said they would wish to \nconsult with me so, temporarily, I object.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have some business here to conduct.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield? I have a unanimous consent \nrequest I would like to enter before the 5 o'clock vote.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent when the Senate considers S. \n121, the AMBER Alert bill, Senator Hatch be granted 5 minutes to speak. \nTherefore, debate on the bill would commence at 5 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. No objection. Mr. President, I ask the record reflect I do \nnot waive any of my rights under the motion that the Senator from \nOklahoma offered, and I would renew my motion to waive at a subsequent \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the request of the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma is agreed to.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. REID. I also made a request. I say to my friend from Oklahoma, I \nwant to make sure the record is reflective that I do not waive any of \nmy rights on the motion to waive the Budget Act.\n  Mr. President, while I still have the floor, we have a few minutes \nuntil 5 o'clock when debate on the AMBER Alert matter takes place. We \nhave two matters. We have the Senator from West Virginia to be heard--I \ndid see him here. He wanted to speak on the Ridge nomination, which is \ngoing to come up. He wanted to get that debate out of the way.\n  We also have Senator Nelson here, who has been patiently waiting, who \nwishes to offer an amendment on his behalf and that of Senator Inhofe. \nWe would need consent to set aside the pending amendment to allow him \nto do that.\n  I ask unanimous consent the pending amendment be set aside for the \nSenator from Florida to offer his amendment. He said he would need 25 \nor 30 minutes to speak, but he said that he could do that this \nafternoon in 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 97\n\n       (Purpose: To make additional appropriations for emergency \n     relief activities)\n\n\n[[Page S1230]]\n\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I call up amendment No. 97 and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida (Mr. Nelson), for himself, Mr. \n     Daschle, Mr. Leahy, and Mr. Durbin, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 97.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec.__. In addition to amounts appropriated by this Act \n     under the heading ``Public Law 480 Title II Grants'', there \n     is appropriated, out of funds in the Treasury not otherwise \n     appropriated, $600,000,000 for assistance for emergency \n     relief activities: Provided, That the amount appropriated \n     under this section shall remain available through September \n     30, 2004: Provided further, That the entire amount \n     appropriated under this section is designated by the Congress \n     as an emergency requirement pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A) \n     of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of \n     1985.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise to address a \nhumanitarian crisis in the world that has not been getting the \nattention its magnitude warrants. The world has focused on the buildup \nof forces in the Persian Gulf region for a possible war. We focused on \na very dangerous situation in North Korea, which threatens the U.S. \ninterests and Asian security. We have a litany of problems plaguing the \nWestern Hemisphere as well, relating to narcotics trafficking, civil \nwar, and abject poverty.\n  But today I call to the Senate's attention, sub-Saharan Africa and \nthe starvation that is occurring in east Africa, in west Africa, \ncentral Africa and in the southern part of Africa. The droughts in \nthese areas have caused a massive food shortage which will worsen over \nthe next few months and threatens the lives of millions of Africans. It \nis our responsibility, as a nation of bounty, to demonstrate to the \nworld that the United States lives up to its commitments and \nobligations to those in need.\n  In that spirit I am offering this amendment. This amendment is not \nabout politics. If you will recall what President Reagan once said, he \nsaid:\n\n       A hungry child knows no politics.\n\n  He was correct. This is about people dying. This is about reaching \nout and saving lives. We have an opportunity to do the right thing now, \nand that is save African children from starving to death.\n  Congressman Frank Wolf, my good friend, has just returned from \nEthiopia and Eritrea.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that his report of his trip be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Trip Report: Ethiopia and Eritrea--December 29, 2002-January 4, 2003\n\n       Babies wailing and screeching, desperately trying to get \n     nourishment from their mothers' breasts.\n       Two- and three-year-olds so severely malnourished that they \n     cannot stand, much less crawl or walk, their pencil-thin legs \n     so frail that they could be snapped like a twig with little \n     or no effort.\n       Young boys and girls with bloated bellies. A teenager whose \n     legs are no thicker than my wrist.\n       Drinking water almost non-existent--a four-hour walk each \n     way just to find some. Fields scorched. Crops failed.\n       River beds dry as a bone. Hand-dug collecting ponds for \n     rain so sun-baked that the earth has cracked.\n       Disease. Despair.\n       These are some of the horrific sites I witnessed last week \n     in Ethiopia, which once again is facing a famine of \n     catastrophic proportions.\n       I spent a week in Ethiopia in 1984--when nearly one million \n     people died of starvation--including two nights in a feeding \n     camp. The squalid conditions of the camps and the suffering \n     faces of the children, mothers and elderly were haunting and \n     unforgettable. What I saw--and experienced--changed me \n     forever. I never thought I would see something like that \n     again. I have. Last week.\n       By Easter, thousands of Ethiopians could be dead from \n     starvation. Children living in villages just 90 miles from \n     the capital city, Addis Ababa, which is easily accessible by \n     truck, are already near death. Conditions in villages in more \n     remote areas of the country are significantly worse.\n\n\n                             Dire Situation\n\n       While the government of Ethiopia is out in front of trying \n     to draw attention to the crisis--unlike in 1984 when the \n     Mengistu government tried to keep the famine secret until a \n     BBC camera crew broke the story--what makes this year's \n     crisis more horrific is that the population of Ethiopia has \n     increased from 45 million in 1984 to 69 million today. In \n     addition, HIV/AIDS is spreading throughout the country and \n     Ethiopia's 2\\1/2\\-year border was with neighboring Eritrea \n     has drained precious resources and led to thousands of \n     displaced people and families, particularly in remote areas \n     of the country.\n       With each crisis--drought, war, disease--more families \n     become destitute and completely dependent on others for their \n     welfare and survival. The repeated droughts have made more \n     people vulnerable to hunger and hunger-related diseases, \n     sharply increasing the danger of outright starvation among \n     groups that may have been able to survive previous crop \n     failures and livestock losses.\n       This also is a tough neighborhood, with Sudan bordering to \n     the west and Somalia to the east. These countries are \n     struggling to overcome internal turmoil of their own and \n     refugees from each have crossed into Ethiopia and are living \n     in refugee camps.\n       But perhaps the greatest difficulty is getting the world to \n     respond. The focus in capital cities around the globe is the \n     war on terror, Iraq and North Korea.\n\n\n                         how could this happen?\n\n       I do not believe this situation should ever have been \n     allowed to develop. Does anyone really believe that the world \n     would turn a blind eye if this crisis were unfolding in \n     France or Australia? If the photographs in this report were \n     of Norwegian children wouldn't the world be rushing to help? \n     Is not the value of an Ethiopian child or Eritrean mother the \n     same in the eyes of God?\n       This disaster has been building since last fall, yet there \n     has been little mention of it in the Western media, let alone \n     any in depth reports. Without graphic photographs and video-\n     tape, foreign governments will not feel the pressure to act.\n       The situation in Ethiopia is dire and many believe if \n     immediate action is not taken to address the looming crisis, \n     the number of people who could die from starvation could \n     surpass those who perished during the 1984-1985 drought. In \n     1984, 8 million were in need of food aid. Today, more than 11 \n     million people--just slightly less than the combined \n     population of Maryland and Virginia--are presently at risk \n     and that number is growing every day.\n       Last year's crops produced little or nothing, even in parts \n     of the country that normally provide surpluses of food. The \n     demand for international food aid is tremendous. I was told \n     there is enough food in the country to meet January's needs \n     and part of February's, although at reduced levels. \n     Incredibly, there is nothing in the pipeline to deal with \n     March, April, May, or the rest of the year. Even if ships \n     leaded with grain were to leave today, many would not make it \n     in time to avert disaster.\n       Villagers are living on about 900 calories a day. The \n     average American lives on 2,200 to 2,400 calories a day.\n       An elderly woman at a feeding station in the northern part \n     of the country showed me her monthly allotment of wheat: it \n     would have fit into a bowling ball bag.\n       A man working under the hot African sun with fellow \n     villagers to dig a massive rain collecting pond--each \n     carrying 50-pound bags of dirt up from the bottom of the \n     pit--told me he had not had a drink of water all day and \n     didn't know if he would eat that night. It would depend on \n     whether his children had food.\n\n\n                                no water\n\n       Water--for drinking and bathing--is almost non-existent, \n     and what is available, is putrid. There is no medicine--and \n     even if there was something as simple as an aspirin there is \n     no water with which to wash it down. Disease is rampant.\n       During my trip I visited villages in both the north and \n     south of the country. I went to a food distribution center \n     and a health clinic. I talked with farmers who had already \n     begun to sell off their livestock and mothers who did not \n     know where or when their children would get their next meal. \n     I met with U.S. State Department officials and NGOs. I also \n     met with Prime Minister Meles and a number of relief \n     officials in his government.\n       The government's decision not to establish feeding camps is \n     a wise one. The camps only exacerbate the crisis because they \n     allow diseases to spread much more quickly and take people \n     away from their homes and albeit limited support systems. In \n     1984, many families traveled great distances to reach the \n     camps and by the time they got there were often near death. \n     Moreover, villagers who left for the camps and somehow \n     managed to survive had nothing to return to because they had \n     lost their homes and sold their livestock.\n       Fortunately, relief organizations, including U.S. AID and \n     the United Nations World Food Programme, have developed an \n     early warning system to better predict the effects of the \n     looming crisis and have been sounding the alarm since the \n     fall.\n       Nevertheless, they are facing an uphill battle. Donor \n     fatigue is a very real problem.\n\n\n                         competing world crisis\n\n       Getting the world--and the United States, in particular--to \n     focus on the issue is difficult because of the war on \n     terrorism, the situation in Iraq and the growing crisis in \n     North Korea.\n       Since August 2002, the United States has provided \n     approximately 430,000 metric tons\n\n[[Page S1231]]\n\n     of food, valued at $179 million. This amount constitutes \n     approximately 25 percent of the total need in the country. \n     The U.S. government will need to do more to avert a disaster \n     of biblical proportions.\n       Before leaving on the trip, a number of well read people in \n     the Washington area looked at me quizzically when I told them \n     I was going to Ethiopia. They all asked why? When I told them \n     that the country was facing another famine along the scale of \n     1984, they were dumbfounded.\n       Time is of the essence. A village can slip dramatically in \n     just a matter of weeks. Many of the children I saw last week \n     will be dead by early February and those who do somehow \n     miraculously survive will be severely retarded. The world \n     cannot afford to wait any longer.\n       I also visited neighboring Eritrea, where the situation is \n     not much better. Widespread crop failures are expected as a \n     result of the drought. Compounding the situation are the \n     lingering effects of its war with Ethiopia, which ended in \n     December 2000. While nearly 200,000 refugees and displaced \n     persons have been reintegrated into society following the \n     truce, almost 60,000 have been unable to return to their \n     homes due to the presence of land mines, unexploded \n     ordnance, insecurity or the simple fact that the \n     infrastructure near their homes has been completely \n     destroyed.\n\n\n                            recommendations\n\n       Donors, including the United States, must make prompt and \n     significant food-aid pledges to help Ethiopia overcome its \n     current crisis. The food pipeline could break down as early \n     as next month if donors do not act immediately. There are a \n     number of countries, Canada and France, for instance, that \n     can and should do more.\n       The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) must work to \n     ensure that the U.S. assistance is released as quickly as \n     possible.\n       When President Bush visits Africa, he should consider going \n     to Ethiopia. I believe he would be moved by what he sees.\n       The Bush Administration should make an effort to rally \n     public support similar to what was done during the 1984-85 \n     famine. Perhaps the new director of faith-based initiatives \n     at USAID should serve as the coordinator for such an effort.\n       Donor support also must include water, seeds and medicine \n     as well as veterinary assistance.\n       The Ethiopian government should take its case to capitals \n     around the globe, sending representatives to donor nations \n     armed with photographs of dying children to put a face on the \n     growing crisis. Regrettably, if they do not ask, they will \n     not receive.\n       The Ethiopian government must contribute additional food \n     aid from its own resources as it did in 2000 and 2002 as a \n     sign of leadership and commitment to the welfare of its \n     people.\n       More must be done to develop long-term strategies to tackle \n     the root causes of the food shortages in Ethiopia, like \n     improving irrigation and developing drought-resistant crops. \n     The government must develop a 10- or 15-year plan designed to \n     help end the constant cycle of massive food shortages. A well \n     developed plan would go a long way toward reassuring the \n     international community that the country wants to end its \n     dependence on handouts.\n       The Ethiopian government also should do more to help \n     diversity its economy. Its largest export--coffee--is subject \n     to huge price fluctuations in the world market and rather \n     than exporting hides and leather to Italy and China--only to \n     come back as belts, purses and shoes--the government should \n     work to attract business that will make these products on \n     Ethiopian soil.\n       The government of Ethiopia also should consider a sweeping \n     land reform policy that would allow farmers to own their \n     property rather than the government owning all the country's \n     land, a vestige of the country's socialist days.\n       The media needs to more aggressively pursue this looming \n     crisis. It was responsible for making the world aware of the \n     terrible famine that was occurring in 1984 and has the \n     ability to let the world know about the tragedy unfolding \n     again.\n       Many of the same issues that apply to Ethiopia apply to \n     Eritrea. Both countries are in desperate need of assistance.\n       In closing, I want to thank all the people--from government \n     officials in both Ethiopia and Eritrea to U.S. officials and \n     NGOs and missionaries in both countries--who are working \n     around the clock to deal with this crisis. I also want to \n     thank U.S. Ambassador to Eritrea Donald McConnell and U.S. \n     Ambassador to Ethiopia Auzerlia Brazeal and their respective \n     staffs for all they do. They are outstanding representatives \n     of the U.S. government. Special thanks go to Jack Doutrich in \n     Eritrea and Karen Freeman, Jo Raisin and Makeda Tsegaye in \n     Ethiopia. Roy ``Reb'' Brownell with USAID in Washington also \n     deserves special recognition.\n       Finally, I want to thank Lt. Col. Malcom Shorter, who \n     accompanied me on the trip, and Dan Scandling, my chief of \n     staff, who took all the photographs and videotaped the trip.\n       Available on line at: http://www.house.gov/wolf.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. This report states that thousands of \nEthiopians could be dead of starvation by Easter. Frank Wolf writes:\n\n       More than 11 million people, just slightly less than the \n     combined population of Maryland and Virginia--are presently \n     at risk--and that number is growing every day. That number \n     could surpass the number that died in the 1984-85 hunger \n     crisis in the region.\n\n  The U.N. World Food Programme also warned of severe food shortages \nthis spring, estimating that between 10 million and 14 million \nEthiopians, at risk of starvation, are at risk of starvation in this \nyear, 2003.\n  Back in 1985, my wife Grace and I spent 8 days in the feeding camps \nin Ethiopia. And every day we carry with us what we experienced.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record, since I do not \nhave the time to read portions, an article that I wrote in January of \n1985 about the starvation that occurred there.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               Ethiopian Hunger Problem Baffles the Mind\n\n       Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.--Here in this drought-stricken land \n     the enormity of the hunger problem baffles the mind. As I \n     visited the feeding centers where gentle humans are restoring \n     life to some of the starving, I was bewildered as to how to \n     solve this crisis.\n       The problem of famine in Africa is real. Twenty nations \n     have been affected. Seven are critical. Just in Ethiopia \n     alone, over 7 million people are threatened by starvation.\n       A severe drought is a major cause. The rains either did not \n     come or were less than is required to germinate the seeds in \n     the fertile soil.\n       Agricultural techniques are backward. There are few drilled \n     wells, little irrigation, almost no fertilizer used and \n     severe topsoil erosion. If there is to be problem-solving, it \n     will be long-term and it will be painful. Attitudes will have \n     to be changed to use modern agricultural methods. And in \n     Marxist countries, the collective farm reduces the farmer's \n     incentive to produce for himself and only aggravates the \n     sparse production.\n       There have been four major droughts in Ethiopia in the last \n     35 years. People have died of starvation. But this is the \n     worst drought and death is apparent throughout the land.\n       My visit to Alamata and Korem, two feeding centers 250 \n     miles north of Addis Ababa, was shocking. The emaciated \n     bodies of young and old were overwhelming. One's emotions \n     cannot be controlled as you see the helpless trying to \n     survive. The huge numbers dulled my sense of hope.\n       Thousands have died and thousands more died in remote \n     villages which statistics will not record. But there is \n     hope--because humankind is responding--and responding well.\n       The Free World is responding swiftly by sharing its \n     abundance of food, medicine and blankets. Help from Western \n     nations, from the private sector and from government, is \n     pouring in. People are acting out of their best humanitarian \n     instincts.\n       The United States is leading the pack. There are not many \n     ``ugly Americans'' in Africa today. We are responding from \n     our generosity. And America is responding mightily!\n       Americans are responding as a government. President Reagan \n     has announced his intention to provide one-half of the food \n     assistance needed in Africa this year--a $500 million U.S. \n     contribution. For Ethiopia, a Marxist state, with whom we \n     have strained relations, $130 million in food is already \n     planned. This government-supplied grain is distributed by \n     many private volunteer agencies, such as Catholic Relief and \n     World Vision, and soon some will be given directly to the \n     Ethiopian government relief agency. The sacks bear the words: \n     ``Donated by the People of the United States of America.''\n       The private sector is also responding. For 1985, food \n     assistance to Ethiopia through private organizations is \n     estimated to be $125 million, with another $22 million spent \n     on Ethiopian refugees elsewhere.\n       The private sector from Florida responded magnificently. A \n     ``flight of mercy'' was organized, funded, loaded, and flown \n     to Addis Ababa, which bespeaks the generosity of Floridians.\n       This mission was conceived by my wife, Grace Nelson, as a \n     needed response to the problems she had seen in Africa last \n     summer. In Mali, she held a starving child in her arms. She \n     has not been able to forget it. After organizing some \n     fundraising activities, the thought of a ``flight of mercy'' \n     came from a discussion with the editor of the Florida Times \n     Union. He suggested that although people wanted to help, they \n     needed a concrete mission to respond to and one which could \n     be tracked to a successful conclusion.\n       This story is an American success story. A DC-8 was \n     chartered and loaded with 40 tons of food, medicine and \n     blankets, in the midst of ongoing fund drives. WCPX-TV in \n     Orlando collected over $80,000 and two truckloads of \n     blankets. World Vision, a Christian humanitarian \n     organization, provided the mechanism for obtaining the two \n     tons of medicine and thirty-eight tons of fortified food, \n     eleven tons of which were donated by a former Ethiopian \n     official in Indiana. This special mixture of oats, powdered \n     milk and honey, known as ATMIT, is indigenous to Ethiopia. \n     Another $120,000 was raised before the flight departed \n     Chicago on January 12th.\n       The plane was so long you could hardly see from one end of \n     the cargo bay to the other. During the 24-hour journey, our \n     group of\n\n[[Page S1232]]\n\n     ``food shepherds'' slept on top of the pallets of fortified \n     food using some of the donated blankets for warmth. It was a \n     good feeling to know that our mission was one of trying to \n     help the starving by actually taking food to them.\n       Our landing was the first of a stretch-DC-8 on the Addis \n     Ababa runway. TransAmerican Cargo Airlines and World Vision \n     soon had the cargo unloaded.\n       Success does not come easily and indeed we soon had our \n     problems. Food was being delayed to the feeding centers \n     because rebel activity in the region interrupted \n     transportation of supplies. When we finally were cleared for \n     an old DC-3 to fly us to the camps, we found they were \n     running dangerously low on food. But our supplies arrived \n     just in time.\n       I shall never forget the children, also starved for \n     affection, clinging to my hands and arms smiling in spit of \n     their physical deprivation. They were proof that the World \n     Vision feeding center was successful because only a few weeks \n     before they had been lifeless and lethargic. Others were in \n     intensive care, often with their mothers, as nutritional \n     supplements were administered--sometimes through a tube \n     because they were too weak to eat.\n       The staff was loving and kind . . . it showed. The nuns at \n     the Missionaries of Charity Compound ministered to the dying. \n     These sisters are sponsored by Mother Teresa of Calcutta, who \n     had just paid a visit, greeting and blessing each person in \n     the camp--9,000 of them! What a lesson in love.\n       There are those who say, ``let them die.'' Their theories \n     of over-population and survival-of-the-fittest are practical, \n     they say. Besides ``why should we care about a foreign, \n     strange land?'' Fortunately, most of America does not think \n     that way. The goodwill, hopes and prayers of Floridians were \n     obvious in our specific flight of mercy. Many have responded \n     before, others are following.\n       This mission was successful because of the spirit and \n     character of our people. Perhaps it is best summed up in \n     Matthew Chapter 25: ``When you did it for the least of these, \n     you were doing it for me.''\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, from my letter, which will be \nin the Record, you will see the similarity to what we have here today.\n  Just in Eritrea, crop failures and the lack of rainfall put about 1.5 \nmillion at risk--just less than half the population. But these \ngrotesque figures only speak to those in the Horn of Africa. For \nexample, down in Zimbabwe, 49 percent of the population is in need; in \nMalawi, approximately 29 percent of the population is in need; in \nZambia, approximately 26 percent of the population; and in Lesotho, \napproximately 30 percent of the population. These are just some of the \ncountries whose populations need food right now.\n  The World Food Programme estimates that a total of over 38 million \npeople are at risk of starvation throughout Africa this year. This \nfigure is almost beyond comprehension, and compels this body to provide \nrelief.\n\n  The toll of this famine threatens to be far worse than anything we \nhave seen previously for another reason. The terrible epidemic of HIV/\nAIDS, which is currently ravaging the continent, destroys the immune \nsystems of its victims. When further weakened by malnutrition, they are \nunable to fight off even the most mild illnesses. If we do not act, the \ndeath toll will rise, and it will rise quickly.\n  There is also a security aspect to providing this relief. It is well-\nknown that the Horn of Africa has had its problems with extremism, \nparticularly in nearby Sudan. As such, crises in this region may pose \nsignificant security threats as we fight the global war on terrorism. \nTerrorist organizations and other extremists have frequently used food \nas a political weapon in past famines. By controlling the distribution \nof food, they can hold entire populations of hungry people hostage, and \nthereby gain their unwitting support. We must combat these threats on \nall fronts, including providing relief, and with it order, to regions \nthat desperately need it.\n  Now, allow me to explain this amendment in the context of the fiscal \nyear 2003 appropriations bill we are debating. Because of the Congress' \ninability to pass the 2003 appropriations bills on time, food relief is \nbeing undercut by $252 million as we operate at 2002 funding levels. \nMoreover, such severe food shortages in Africa were not contemplated in \nthe president's 2003 request. Simply funding the president's request \nwill not be enough to stave off a massive starvation crisis in Sub-\nSaharan Africa.\n  I ask that a letter from the Alliance for Food Security to President \nBush dated January 3, 2003 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                   Alliance for Food Security,\n\n                                                  January 3, 2003.\n     Hon. George W. Bush,\n     President of the United States, The White House, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: US charitable, agricultural and \n     commercial groups have come together to urge additional US \n     Government funding to provide assistance to 30 million \n     Africans suffering from severe food shortages, without \n     diminishing US efforts to address chronic hunger and provide \n     relief elsewhere. To assure that previously-planned food aid \n     programs and emergency relief can go forward in fiscal year \n     (FY) 2003, we urge you to seek full funding of the $1.2 \n     billion appropriations for PL 480 Title II when the current \n     continuing appropriations bill expires. To provide the \n     additional commodities needed for urgent emergencies in \n     Ethiopia, Eritrea and southern Africa, we ask you to seek \n     emergency supplemental funds for the $603-778 million that \n     would provide half of the commodities to meet projected needs \n     for FY 2003.\n       In FY 2003, US food aid levels are alarmingly insufficient. \n     There are several reasons for this resource gap.\n       First, Congress has not yet passed the FY 2003 \n     appropriations bill and is forcing PL 480 Title II to operate \n     at a level that is $252 million less than the \n     Administration's FY 2003 budget request. Second, even if the \n     Administration's FY 2003 budget request for Title II is \n     approved, because most commodity prices have increased, that \n     funding level would buy 30% fewer commodities than originally \n     planned. Third, severe food shortages in southern and eastern \n     Africa were not anticipated when the Administration prepared \n     its FY 2003 budget request, and these emergencies require an \n     additional $600-778 million above the Administration's FY \n     2003 budget request.\n       Finally, for FY 2003, the Administration initiated a policy \n     which precludes the purchase of commodities for food aid \n     using general Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) authority. \n     Instead, the Administration stated its intent that it would \n     seek appropriations to meet legitimate food aid needs. \n     Although the FY 2003 PL 480 Title II budget request was \n     increased to make up for the loss of a portion of CCC \n     commodities, the funding request is insufficient to meet the \n     needs of both ongoing programs for poor and displaced \n     persons, as well as people facing emergency food shortages.\n       Insufficient funding for ongoing Title II programs will \n     hurt millions of people in regions that are recovering from \n     war or are vulnerable to crises, such as Afghanistan, West \n     Africa, Bangladesh, Nicaragua, Angola, Somalia and Sudan. \n     Cuts in these programs could also have negative repercussions \n     for U.S. foreign policy and national security interests, and \n     could lead to future emergencies. The more subtle and \n     insidious effects of chronic under-nutrition must not be \n     overlooked. Thus, the full appropriations of $1.2 billion is \n     needed now for FY 2003.\n       Beyond the FY 2003 appropriations, another $603 to $778 \n     million is needed to meet the historic US commitment of \n     providing at least half of the commodities required during a \n     food crisis in poor countries. This funding is needed to \n     provide a nutritious mix of foods to avoid starvation in \n     Ethiopia, Eritrea and 6 southern African countries, and to \n     help people rebuild their strength and take the first \n     steps towards recovery. People are even more vulnerable to \n     starvation due to the HIV/AIDS pandemic, which makes this \n     an extraordinary crisis and requires immediate response. \n     Even if the Bill Emerson Humanitarian Trust is used to \n     provide up to 500,000 MT (valued at $250 million including \n     delivery costs), this would only provide one-third of the \n     estimated emergency needs.\n       In conjunction with delivering adequate food supplies to \n     address the emergencies in Africa, charitable organizations \n     are committed to helping people immediately move into the \n     recovery phase. Food aid must be integral with investments in \n     agricultural production, such as seeds, fertilizer and \n     farming tools, and with expanded HIV/AIDS efforts. This \n     includes services that improve prevention, enable families to \n     provide nutritious foods and care for relatives living with \n     the disease, and ensure the nutritional, educational and \n     financial needs of orphans are met.\n       Using food aid to assist people who are impoverished so in \n     the future they may provide for their own nutritional needs \n     in the main purpose of the PL 480 Title II program. It is an \n     equally high calling as helping people who face immediate \n     famine. To diminish the one in order to care for the other is \n     not a choice our great country should make. In compassion and \n     recognition of our urgent needs in Africa while at the same \n     time maintaining the U.S. commitment to fund the \n     developmental and other relief programs of Title II in FY \n     2003.\n           Sincerely,\n       ACDI/VOCA.\n       Africare.\n       American Maritime Congress.\n       American Soybean Association.\n       Astaris LLC.\n       Bread for the World.\n       California Wheat Commission.\n       Chippewa Valley Bean Co., Inc.\n       Didion Milling, Inc.\n       Friends of World Food.\n       Illinois Soybean Association.\n\n[[Page S1233]]\n\n       Adventist Development & Relief Agency International.\n       Agricor, Inc.\n       American Red Cross.\n       APL Limited.\n       Bethel Grain Company.\n       California Association of Wheat Growers.\n       CARE.\n       Central Bag Company.\n       Counterpart International.\n       Food for the Hungry, Inc.\n       Global Food & Nutrition, Inc.\n       International Organization of Masters, Mates & Pilots, ILA, \n     AFL-CIO.\n       International Orthodox Christian Charities.\n       J.R.

Mr. President, this letter from a coalition of \nover 50 nongovernmental, humanitarian and agricultural groups seeks \nbetween $608 and $778 million above the President's request to meet the \ndemands of these emergency circumstances. The $600 million my amendment \nprovides is based on close consultation with these organizations who \nknow the situation well from their work on the ground in Africa.\n  This amendment provides resources called for in the African Famine \nRelief Act of 2003 introduced by Senator Daschle. It does not \nspecifically designate the funds for sub-Saharan Africa, to be \nconsistent with the way we have traditionally appropriated P.L. 480 \nTitle II funds. But I trust that these funds will be used for the \npurpose for which they are intended--staving off the imminent threat of \nmass starvation in Africa.\n  It is my hope that this amendment will be acceptable to my colleagues \non both sides of the aisle, and to the administration, and I will \nexplain why. The designation of these funds as ``emergency funds'' is \nimportant. That means the funds do not have to be spent unless the \nPresident likewise designates this crisis as an emergency. If he does \nnot designate the situation in Africa as an emergency, and most would \nagree it is an emergency, but the President would not be required to \nprovide these funds and it would not affect the topline.\n  Over the weekend, USAID Administrator Andrew Natsios took an \nimportant first step to provide some relief to Ethiopia, by agreeing to \nsend 262 metric tons of food there at a cost of about $127 million. I \ncommend Mr. Natsios and Secretary Powell for their attention to this \nissue, but we need to do more. It is my hope that by speaking about \nthis issue now, increased attention to the plight of the Africans will \nspur American and international action. The U.S. Senate should show \nleadership on this without delay. I thank the Chair, and ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I want to underscore the importance of \nthe issue that Senator Nelson has raised today. Some 38 million \nAfricans are threatened with starvation in the coming months. In a six-\ncountry region encompassing Zambia and Zimbabwe, Malawi and Mozambique, \nSwaziland and Lesotho, 25 percent of the population is urgently in need \nof assistance. This food crisis is striking a tremendously vulnerable \npopulation that has already been devastated by HIV/AIDS, compounding \nthe difficulty of African families' struggle for survival. In the Horn \nof Africa, almost half of Eritrea's population is at risk, and Ethiopia \nstands on the brink of a crisis rivaling that of the mid-1980s.\n  I have served on the Subcommittee on African Affairs since I came to \nthe Senate, and spent over half of my tenure here as either the ranking \nminority member or chairman of that subcommittee. I have watched this \ncrisis unfold over the past year with horror. The United States and the \ninternational community must act now to address this crisis; delay will \nmean death for too many innocent families. But we must also work in the \nmonths and years ahead to address some of the underlying causes of food \ninsecurity in Africa, so that we can reduce communities' vulnerability \nto natural factors affecting harvests. Certainly we need to join with \nthe many Africans who want to ensure that misguided policies and \ndecisions are examined, discarded, and not repeated--from the \ntremendously destructive policies pursued by the Zimbabwean government, \nto corrupt practices affecting food stocks in Malawi, to the impact of \nthe government's national service program on the agricultural sector in \nEritrea. And certainly we need to ensure that assistance is distributed \nresponsibly, fairly, and efficiently. But we also need to help African \nsocieties reinvigorate their agricultural sectors, by working to get \nsmall farmers the technical assistance, infrastructure, and opportunity \nthat they need to succeed.\n  In July of last year, I asked the GAO to examine some of the causes \ncontributing to the southern African food crisis, and to evaluate the \nefficacy of our response, so that we can improve our performance and \nprevent crises in the future. Unfortunately, the World Food Program has \nwarned that early indicators suggest drought may continue to plague the \nregion in the year ahead. I am looking forward to the GAO's final \nreport, and hope that it can point the way toward proactive steps that \nwe can take to work with our African partners on this issue.\n  As another step in this broader, long-term effort, this week I am \nintroducing a resolution calling on USAID to give adequate attention to \nland tenure issues as the agency pursues efforts to bolster \nagricultural development and fight hunger, and I hope to work with my \ncolleagues on other initiatives aimed at addressing underlying causes \nof chronic food insecurity in the months ahead. Too often, we think of \nAfrica only as a troubled continent, full of flood and famine, war and \ndeadly disease. But I have traveled widely on the continent, and I have \nmet with energized and committed Africans from government officials to \nbusinessmen to community activists. There is no lack of good partners \non the continent, and there is no absence of promise or potential. Our \ncommitment to get serious about these issues now can lead to meaningful \nsuccess, improving the lives of millions of Africans and bolstering \nfood security in the region.\n  These long-term initiatives deserve Congress's support, but we will \nbe working with profoundly weakened partners in our every effort--be it \ncounterterrorism initiatives or programs aimed at increasing trade and \ninvestment--if we do not address this immediate emergency. Senator \nNelson is right to sound the alarm about this crisis now, while we have \nan opportunity to act and to help those people currently at risk. To \nhelp now is humane, it is right, and it is in our interest.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Reed \namendment on unemployment insurance which is before the body be \nrecalled, and I move to waive the relevant section of the Budget Act \nfor the consideration of the Reed amendment. Senator Nickles also \nraised a point of order. I just want to move to waive it. Such time as \nwe vote on it will be the decision of the body.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator asking for regular order on \nthat amendment?\n  Mr. REID. I asked that the Reed amendment be recalled. I ask for \nregular order and renew my unanimous consent request to waive the \nrelevant section of the Budget Act for consideration of the Reed \namendment.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S1234]]\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, will the Senator from Florida yield?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, it was clearly my intention to \nregain the floor so I could yield to my friend from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that we return to the Nelson \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I yield to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nFlorida for yielding.\n  Let me first of all say, to clarify the understanding that I have in \nlistening to his presentation, that his request would not necessarily \nbe binding unless the President were to include this as something which \nhe would interpret as an emergency; that is, the funding that is \nrequested by the Senator. Is that correct?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. The Senator is correct. If the President did \nnot designate the situation in Africa as an emergency, the President \nwould not be required to provide these funds and it would not affect \nthe top line.\n  Mr. INHOFE. If the Senator will yield further, I can't quite see the \nSenator's map of the continent. My understanding is that most of that \nis in sub-Saharan Africa. Is that correct?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. The Senator is correct. It involves three \ncountries in east Africa, six countries in west Africa, three countries \nin central Africa, and about seven countries in southern Africa.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, if the Senator would yield further, let me \njust make a comment. I perhaps have had maybe even a conflict of \ninterest in this case. But that conflict has made me very sensitive to \nthe plight they have in sub-Saharan Africa. As the Senator from Florida \nknows, I have been there many times. I am very familiar with that whole \nregion. But in the case of Ethiopia, which seems to be one of the first \nareas the Senator is addressing, a drought is taking place there right \nnow. In fact, I have and I will hold up a picture of a little girl we \nfound during that drought. She was abandoned. She was 3 days old. We \nwere able to get her back into good health. I am very proud to say that \nthis little girl--Zegita Marie Rapert--happens to be my granddaughter. \nShe is now officially adopted.\n  By the way, in case you are wondering why she is wearing a crown, \nthat was her first birthday. She has three older brothers ages 4, 5, \nand 6. It is a pretty typical family. Anyone from Ethiopia is \nconsidered royalty: Queen of Sheba--anyone from Ethiopia is royalty. So \nthey gave her this crown for her first birthday.\n  I would suggest that there is no area that is having a more difficult \ntime right now. I know there is a lot of competition for funds. But I \nthink the way the junior Senator from Florida has structured this \namendment, that would allow the administration to make some of these \ndeterminations and some of these priorities.\n\n  I strongly support the idea of giving some aid to that area because \nof the drought that has been unprecedented for about 12 years. \nHopefully, this will happen, and it will become a reality for these \npeople.\n  We do a lot of talking around here about poverty; we do a lot of \ntalking about problems; but until you see some of the poverty and some \nof the effects of the drought that has taken place right now in the \nsub-Saharan, Africa, it is really one that we don't understand.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/21/senate-section/article/S1234-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1234-S1238]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                NATIONAL AMBER ALERT NETWORK ACT OF 2003\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). Under the previous order, the \nclerk will report S. 121.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 121) to enhance the operation of the AMBER Alert \n     communications network in order to facilitate the recovery of \n     abducted children, to provide for enhanced notification on \n     highways of alerts and information on such children, and for \n     other purposes.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I have a parliamentary \ninquiry. I had asked for the yeas and nays, and there was determined to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  Could you inform me, on the Nelson amendment, what is the \nparliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been ordered on that \namendment.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, if I could ask the Chair to direct the \nSenator's attention to the Senator from Nevada, it is my understanding \nwe have a vote scheduled for 5:15. There are 15 minutes of debate prior \nto that time. The two leaders are trying to figure out what votes are \ngoing to come next. We have a series of amendments that have been \noffered today. I ask that my friend from Florida withhold until the two \nleaders have determined the time for the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise in strong support of S. 121, the \nNational AMBER Alert Network Act of 2003. Specifically, I congratulate \nand thank my colleagues who have worked so hard toward the passage of \nthis needed legislation: Senators Kay Bailey Hutchison and Dianne \nFeinstein. Both of them are deserving of the credit for this bill. I am \nvery proud to align myself with both of them.\n  Senator Hutchison has been a great leader in this area, and I am very \nmuch appreciative of her. Also, Senator Leahy and others have worked \nhard on this bill.\n  The horrific kidnapping of Elizabeth Smart in my home State of Utah \nis illustrative of a terrifying wave of recent child abductions that \nhas swept our Nation. Clearly, there is a tremendous need for \nlegislation to help communities fight these terrible crimes.\n  Without question, when it comes to child abductions, time is of the \nessence. We are all too aware that child abductors prey on the \nyoungest, most innocent and vulnerable members of our society--often \nfor the purpose of committing other serious violent crimes against \nthem.\n  Too often, it is only a matter of hours before a kidnapper abuses, \nassaults or kills the child victim.\n  According to figures released by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, \nalmost 75 percent of the murders that occur following child abductions \nhappen within the first 3 hours.\n  AMBER Alert systems are critical to successful search and recovery \nefforts because they enable law enforcement authorities to galvanize \nentire communities to assist in the safe recovery of child victims.\n  We recently witnessed the success of the AMBER Alert system in \nCalifornia where the system was used to broadcast the disappearance of \nNichole Timmons. After she was recognized, Nichole was safely recovered \nin the neighboring State of Nevada.\n  In another recent California case, the AMBER Alert system was used to \nbroadcast the disappearances of Tamera Brooks and Jaqueline Marris. \nJust hours after their abduction, and minutes before their possible \nmurder, the two young women were found.\n  My home State of Utah recently adopted a statewide alert program \naimed at preventing child abduction called the Rachel Alert. The \nprogram was named after young Rachel Runyan who was kidnapped from \nbehind her home in Sunset, UT, and later found murdered.\n  I know that law enforcement agencies are working closely with \nbroadcasters and the public to develop AMBER Alert systems across our \ncountry. Despite these efforts, however, I believe a National AMBER \nAlert Coordinator in the Department of Justice is needed to assist \nStates in developing effective alert plans that can be coordinated \nnationwide.\n  Fortunately, we already have the technology in place to do just \nthat--the Emergency Broadcast System. For years, broadcasters have been \ncooperating with Government officials and reaching Americans across our \ncountry by issuing emergency alerts on our televisions and radios. We \nhave all experienced an interruption in regular\n\n[[Page S1235]]\n\nprogramming so that a news breaking announcement can be made. With the \naddition of a National AMBER Alert Coordinator and continued \ncooperation between law enforcement officials and broadcasters, we can \ncreate an effective national AMBER Alert system.\n  Just now, I walked into the Senate Chamber with Ed Smart, who, as the \ncountry knows, has joined with his wife and family to launch one of the \nmost brave, concerted, and vigilant efforts ever known to locate their \nprecious daughter, Elizabeth.\n  On many occasions, Ed and Lois Smart have educated me about the need \nfor enhanced efforts to combat child abduction, such as the National \nAMBER Alert Network Act.\n  This measure is overwhelmingly supported by the Smart family and all \nthe parents who have firsthand experience with the uncertainty, pain, \nand trauma that exist while waiting for news about an abducted child.\n  We have no greater resource than our children, and we need to see to \nit that we do all we can to protect them from predators of all types.\n  So let us pass this legislation for Elizabeth Smart and Rachel Runyon \nand, indeed, for all children in our Nation.\n  Madam President, I yield the remainder of our time to the \ndistinguished Senator from Texas, who deserves so much credit for being \non top of this bill and bringing it to the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes forty-five seconds.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, Senator Feinstein and I introduced \nthis bill last session. Under the leadership of Senator Leahy and \nSenator Hatch, it went through in a remarkably short amount of time. \nEveryone could see the need for this bill, something that could be done \non a volunteer basis, but with that Coordinator in the Department of \nJustice, we could really make a difference when a child is abducted in \nthis country.\n  Unfortunately, the bill died in the House. So we have introduced the \nbill again. And this time, once again, through the leadership of \nSenator Hatch and Senator Leahy, it has gone through the committee in \nrecord time. I hope we can pass this bill and give the House plenty of \ntime to also pass this legislation and send it to the President.\n  The President has asked for this bill. He knows we need legislation \non the books to create this Coordinator and to help every abducted \nchild have a chance to live.\n  A Department of Justice study shows that 75 percent of child \nhomicides occur within 3 hours of abduction. AMBER Alerts have gone out \nwithin 17 minutes of an abduction. That means we are giving law \nenforcement personnel the help they need to find this person who takes \na child and wants to do harm to this child.\n  Forty-three abducted children have been recovered with the assistance \nof AMBER Alerts. We now have 85 regional AMBER Alerts in this country, \nup from 53 when we introduced the bill last summer.\n  People like Joann Donnellan are running the National Center for \nMissing and Exploited Children and have provided the technical \nassistance to States and local governments to help us find these \nchildren quickly.\n  In fact, this bill is named for Amber Hagerman of Arlington, TX, who \nwas abducted in 1996 and found murdered. Her death had such an impact \non the community that it was determined that if we could get the word \nout and try to find someone who had taken a child, that it would help \nsave these children.\n  In fact, we have found that AMBER Alerts have been so effective that \nan abductor who saw an AMBER Alert sign in California went to the side \nof the road and let the child out because he knew he was going to be \ncaught and that he was in trouble. So it is very effective.\n  What we want to do is have a Coordinator in the Justice Department \nwho a local law enforcement official can call and not have to make 10 \ncalls to contiguous States. He or she can make that one call to the \nAMBER Alert Coordinator in the Justice Department. That person will \nthen be able to put the word out in contiguous States, without having \nto go through different call lists and wasting time.\n  We know that time saves lives in AMBER Alerts. When a child is \nabducted, if we can save time, we can give that child the chance to not \nbe harmed or horribly murdered, as we have seen in so many instances \nwith child abductions.\n  It is hard for me to understand how someone could prey on a \ndefenseless child. It is the worst nightmare a parent would have to \nhear, that her child or his child has been taken by a stranger and you \ndon't know what has happened. I have met with the parents of Elizabeth \nSmart, the wonderful couple from Utah, who have lost their child to an \nabductor and still have not heard from her. The agony they must go \nthrough every day is something no parent can imagine.\n  With this bill, we will put the coordinator in place. We will help \nset criteria for when an AMBER Alert would go out. We thank the \nNational Association of Broadcasters and the local broadcasters \nassociations because they voluntarily put the word out through radio \nand television in a community where this has occurred.\n  We want to make that go further and wider. We also want to try to \nhelp States with signage and help them know what works. For instance, \nthe blinking signs on highways have been very effective.\n  This is a bill that will make a difference. We know that if we can \nfind a child within 24 hours, we have the best chance for them to be \nrecovered safely.\n  I thank Senator Feinstein, my cosponsor of this bill, and thank again \nSenators Hatch and Leahy for pushing this bill through the Judiciary \nCommittee in record time because we know this bill needs to be on the \nbooks.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I am very pleased the Senate is again \ntaking up and passing the AMBER Alert Network Act. I remember last year \nwhen Senator Hutchison would meet me coming in one door of the Senate \nand she would say: This bill is extremely important. Can we get it up \nand pass it.\n  And before I would get to the other door, Senator Feinstein would \ngrab me saying the same thing.\n  I went to the Judiciary Committee with it. I must say with the strong \nhelp and support of the then-ranking member, now chairman of the \ncommittee, Senator Hatch. In the course of just 1 week after we \nintroduced this, we held a hearing on the AMBER Alert bill. We passed \nit in the Judiciary Committee, and we passed it in the full Senate. \nThat is almost unheard of.\n  This is a case of what can happen in the Senate when people set aside \npolitical or partisan labels, work together and make sure something can \npass.\n  It was unfortunate that the House did not pass it but now we will \ngive them a chance. I am proud to join Senator Hutchison and Senator \nFeinstein as an original cosponsor of the legislation.\n  Senator Hutchison said it very well, the reasons for the legislation, \nas did Senator Hatch. I commend those Senators for their leadership. \nSenator Hutchison and Senator Feinstein have been absolutely dynamic in \nthis case. Because of their support, they made it possible for Senator \nHatch and I to get the unanimous support of the Judiciary Committee to \nmove this bill.\n  It has been credited with recovering 43 children nationwide; 84 \nmodified versions have been adopted in local, regional and Statewide \nlocations. And 33 States have a Statewide plan.\n  My home State of Vermont is not yet one of them, but this bill would \nhelp towns and counties in States such as mine to build and maintain \nthe AMBER Alert.\n  We spoke about how parents feel. I can imagine, when my children were \ngrowing up, the terrible fear that my wife and I would have had at the \ndisappearance of any one of them. I don't know how a parent or \ngrandparent gets through that. I don't know how members of the family \nget through it. The most vulnerable and most trusting part of our \nsociety is our children. Because they are the most vulnerable and the \nmost trusting, we, not only as legislators but as parents, as family \nmembers, owe a particular duty to them.\n  I know President Bush is ready to sign this bill as soon as it is \npassed by\n\n[[Page S1236]]\n\nboth bodies and goes to his desk. I urge all Senators to vote for it to \nsend a very clear message to the other body that we support it. It is a \nbipartisan bill. They would then pass it. The President will sign it.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I am pleased to support the National \nAmber Alert Network Act of 2003. I urge the House of Representatives to \ntake prompt action to pass this critical legislation and for the \nPresident to support it.\n  We have all heard the stories of parents who have found themselves \ntrying to find a child who has been abducted, while fearing serious \ninjury or even death. While local law enforcement officials work \ntirelessly to locate these children, the reality is that they are not \nalways able to find a child in time without the help of the public.\n  What has made the difference around the country in many communities \nis the Amber program, a system designed to get critical information to \nthe general public that might lead to locating a child and his or her \nabductor before the worst can happen.\n  The National Amber Alert Network Act of 2003 builds upon successful \nlocal programs and encourages other communities to develop Amber \nprograms. The National Amber Alert Network Act of 2003 would enhance \nlocal programs by giving State and local communities help in \napprehending an abductor who takes a child and then crosses State \nlines. In Wisconsin, there are three Amber programs in effect, in \nMadison, in La Crosse and in Green Bay. But, if a child is taken from \nWisconsin and brought across State lines to another State, the local \nAmber programs have no uniform way to get critical information from one \nState to another.\n  The National Amber Alert Network Act of 2003 would allow communities \nthe flexibility to develop Amber programs that are responsive to the \nneeds of their areas and provide Federal assistance and coordination \nfor local programs. The National Amber Alert Network Act would have the \nDepartment of Justice create a national coordinator to work on \ninterstate issues, develop voluntary minimum standards for the issuance \nand dissemination of Amber alerts, and provide matching grants for the \ndevelopment and enhancement of local Amber alert plans.\n  The cost of implementing the National Amber Alert Network Act of 2003 \nis small when we consider the price every parent and community must pay \nwhen children are not protected. I am hopeful the National Amber Alert \nNetwork Act will help local programs continue to reunite families and \napprehend their abductors.\n  (At the request of Mr. Leahy, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, today, the Senate will vote \non a bill that will save children's lives by expanding the existing \nAMBER Alert program nationwide.\n  I want to commend Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison for her continued \nleadership on this legislation. Her work on this bill has been \nextraordinary.\n  I also want give a special thanks to Senator Hatch, Chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, and to Senator Leahy, the Ranking Member, for \nputting the National Amber Alert Network Act on the fast track to the \nSenate Floor.\n  Senator Hutchison and I introduced the bill on January 9th, 2003. \nNow, just a couple of weeks later, we are voting on Senate passage. I \nam hopeful that this tidal wave of Senate support will carry over to \nthe House and we soon will have a national AMBER Alert law.\n  So what are AMBER Alerts? AMBER Alerts are official bulletins \ntransmitted over the airwaves to enlist the public's help in tracking \ndown child abductors fleeing a crime scene.\n  AMBER Alerts are such powerful tools because they can be issued \nwithin minutes of an abduction and reach a wide public audience.\n  Statistics show that children in the most dangerous abduction cases \nhave precious little time until their safety is compromised.\n  According to a study by the U.S. Department of Justice, 74 percent of \nchildren who were abducted, and later found murdered, are killed in the \nfirst hours after being taken.\n  Simply put, we need more AMBER Alerts because they may be the best \ntool law enforcement has to save kidnaped children facing imminent \ndanger.\n  The National AMBER Alert Network Act has three key components.\n  First, the legislation would authorize $20 million to the Department \nof Transportation and $5 million to the Department of Justice in FY \n2004 to provide grants for the development of AMBER Alert systems, \nelectronic message boards, and training and education programs in \nstates that do not have AMBER Alerts.\n  To date, AMBER Alert systems exist in 34 states and a total of 85 \nlocal, regional and state jurisdictions. This bill would help the \nexpansion of AMBER Alerts to new jurisdictions.\n  Second, the bill would build upon the President's Executive Order by \nauthorizing a national coordinator for AMBER Alerts in the Department \nof Justice to expand the network of AMBER Alert systems and to \ncoordinate the issuance of region-wide AMBER Alerts.\n  Third, the bill provides a framework for the Department of Justice to \nestablish minimum standards for the regional coordination of AMBER \nalerts. The Department of Justice, working with the National Center for \nMissing and Exploited Children and other private organizations with \nexpertise in this area, would build upon the best standards currently \nin place.\n  The effectiveness of AMBER Alerts depends on the continued judicious \nuse of the system so that the public does not grow to ignore the \nwarnings.\n  Furthermore, it is the specific intent of this bill not to interfere \nwith the operation of the 85 AMBER plans that are working today.\n  Participation in regional AMBER plans is voluntary, and any plan that \nwishes to go it alone may still do so.\n  I urge members to support this bill because AMBER Alerts have a \nproven track record.\n  Nationally, since 1996, the AMBER Alert has been credited with the \nsafe return of 43 children to their families, including one case in \nwhich an abductor reportedly released the child after hearing the alert \nhimself.\n  I would like to briefly describe two of these cases: the rescues of \n10-year-old Nichole Timmons from Riverside and four-year-old Jessica \nCortez from Los Angeles.\n  Last fall, Nichole Timmons and her mother Sharon attended a hearing \nof the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Technology, Terrorism, and \nGovernment Information on the AMBER Alert program.\n  In moving testimony, Sharon described how Nichole was abducted from \ntheir Riverside home on August 20, 2002 and how an AMBER Alert brought \nher daughter back to her within hours of the abduction.\n  In Nichole's case, an Alert was issued not just in California, but in \nNevada as well.\n  After learning about the Alert, a tribal police officer in Nevada \nspotted the truck of Nichole's abductor and stopped him within 24 hours \nof the abduction.\n  He was found with duct tape and a metal pipe. The AMBER Alert was the \nonly reason that Nichole was able to return home to her mother--safe.\n  I can't think of any testimony in support of a bill more powerful \nthan the sight of a mother sitting next to her daughter who she thought \nmight be gone forever.\n  The second case I want to mention is that of Jessica Cortez. Jessica \ndisappeared from Echo Park in Los Angeles on August 11, 2002.\n  But when Jessica's abductor took her to a clinic for medical care, \nreceptionist Denise Leon recognized Jessica from the AMBER Alert and \nnotified law enforcement.\n  Without the publicity generated by the Alert, Jessica could have been \nlost to her parents forever.\n  Through this legislation, we will extend to every corner of the \nnation a network of AMBER Alerts that will protect our children.\n  This program will increase the odds that an abducted child will \nreturn to his or her family safely.\n  But importantly, it will deter potential abductors from taking a \nchild in the first place.\n  As Marc Klaas said at a hearing on the bill last fall, this \nlegislation will ``save kid's lives.''\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I yield back whatever time remains on \nthis side.\n\n[[Page S1237]]\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I yield back whatever time we have, and I \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n[[Page S1238]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/21/senate-section/article/S1234-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1234-S1238]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                NATIONAL AMBER ALERT NETWORK ACT OF 2003\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). Under the previous order, the \nclerk will report S. 121.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 121) to enhance the operation of the AMBER Alert \n     communications network in order to facilitate the recovery of \n     abducted children, to provide for enhanced notification on \n     highways of alerts and information on such children, and for \n     other purposes.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I have a parliamentary \ninquiry. I had asked for the yeas and nays, and there was determined to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  Could you inform me, on the Nelson amendment, what is the \nparliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been ordered on that \namendment.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, if I could ask the Chair to direct the \nSenator's attention to the Senator from Nevada, it is my understanding \nwe have a vote scheduled for 5:15. There are 15 minutes of debate prior \nto that time. The two leaders are trying to figure out what votes are \ngoing to come next. We have a series of amendments that have been \noffered today. I ask that my friend from Florida withhold until the two \nleaders have determined the time for the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise in strong support of S. 121, the \nNational AMBER Alert Network Act of 2003. Specifically, I congratulate \nand thank my colleagues who have worked so hard toward the passage of \nthis needed legislation: Senators Kay Bailey Hutchison and Dianne \nFeinstein. Both of them are deserving of the credit for this bill. I am \nvery proud to align myself with both of them.\n  Senator Hutchison has been a great leader in this area, and I am very \nmuch appreciative of her. Also, Senator Leahy and others have worked \nhard on this bill.\n  The horrific kidnapping of Elizabeth Smart in my home State of Utah \nis illustrative of a terrifying wave of recent child abductions that \nhas swept our Nation. Clearly, there is a tremendous need for \nlegislation to help communities fight these terrible crimes.\n  Without question, when it comes to child abductions, time is of the \nessence. We are all too aware that child abductors prey on the \nyoungest, most innocent and vulnerable members of our society--often \nfor the purpose of committing other serious violent crimes against \nthem.\n  Too often, it is only a matter of hours before a kidnapper abuses, \nassaults or kills the child victim.\n  According to figures released by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, \nalmost 75 percent of the murders that occur following child abductions \nhappen within the first 3 hours.\n  AMBER Alert systems are critical to successful search and recovery \nefforts because they enable law enforcement authorities to galvanize \nentire communities to assist in the safe recovery of child victims.\n  We recently witnessed the success of the AMBER Alert system in \nCalifornia where the system was used to broadcast the disappearance of \nNichole Timmons. After she was recognized, Nichole was safely recovered \nin the neighboring State of Nevada.\n  In another recent California case, the AMBER Alert system was used to \nbroadcast the disappearances of Tamera Brooks and Jaqueline Marris. \nJust hours after their abduction, and minutes before their possible \nmurder, the two young women were found.\n  My home State of Utah recently adopted a statewide alert program \naimed at preventing child abduction called the Rachel Alert. The \nprogram was named after young Rachel Runyan who was kidnapped from \nbehind her home in Sunset, UT, and later found murdered.\n  I know that law enforcement agencies are working closely with \nbroadcasters and the public to develop AMBER Alert systems across our \ncountry. Despite these efforts, however, I believe a National AMBER \nAlert Coordinator in the Department of Justice is needed to assist \nStates in developing effective alert plans that can be coordinated \nnationwide.\n  Fortunately, we already have the technology in place to do just \nthat--the Emergency Broadcast System. For years, broadcasters have been \ncooperating with Government officials and reaching Americans across our \ncountry by issuing emergency alerts on our televisions and radios. We \nhave all experienced an interruption in regular\n\n[[Page S1235]]\n\nprogramming so that a news breaking announcement can be made. With the \naddition of a National AMBER Alert Coordinator and continued \ncooperation between law enforcement officials and broadcasters, we can \ncreate an effective national AMBER Alert system.\n  Just now, I walked into the Senate Chamber with Ed Smart, who, as the \ncountry knows, has joined with his wife and family to launch one of the \nmost brave, concerted, and vigilant efforts ever known to locate their \nprecious daughter, Elizabeth.\n  On many occasions, Ed and Lois Smart have educated me about the need \nfor enhanced efforts to combat child abduction, such as the National \nAMBER Alert Network Act.\n  This measure is overwhelmingly supported by the Smart family and all \nthe parents who have firsthand experience with the uncertainty, pain, \nand trauma that exist while waiting for news about an abducted child.\n  We have no greater resource than our children, and we need to see to \nit that we do all we can to protect them from predators of all types.\n  So let us pass this legislation for Elizabeth Smart and Rachel Runyon \nand, indeed, for all children in our Nation.\n  Madam President, I yield the remainder of our time to the \ndistinguished Senator from Texas, who deserves so much credit for being \non top of this bill and bringing it to the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes forty-five seconds.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, Senator Feinstein and I introduced \nthis bill last session. Under the leadership of Senator Leahy and \nSenator Hatch, it went through in a remarkably short amount of time. \nEveryone could see the need for this bill, something that could be done \non a volunteer basis, but with that Coordinator in the Department of \nJustice, we could really make a difference when a child is abducted in \nthis country.\n  Unfortunately, the bill died in the House. So we have introduced the \nbill again. And this time, once again, through the leadership of \nSenator Hatch and Senator Leahy, it has gone through the committee in \nrecord time. I hope we can pass this bill and give the House plenty of \ntime to also pass this legislation and send it to the President.\n  The President has asked for this bill. He knows we need legislation \non the books to create this Coordinator and to help every abducted \nchild have a chance to live.\n  A Department of Justice study shows that 75 percent of child \nhomicides occur within 3 hours of abduction. AMBER Alerts have gone out \nwithin 17 minutes of an abduction. That means we are giving law \nenforcement personnel the help they need to find this person who takes \na child and wants to do harm to this child.\n  Forty-three abducted children have been recovered with the assistance \nof AMBER Alerts. We now have 85 regional AMBER Alerts in this country, \nup from 53 when we introduced the bill last summer.\n  People like Joann Donnellan are running the National Center for \nMissing and Exploited Children and have provided the technical \nassistance to States and local governments to help us find these \nchildren quickly.\n  In fact, this bill is named for Amber Hagerman of Arlington, TX, who \nwas abducted in 1996 and found murdered. Her death had such an impact \non the community that it was determined that if we could get the word \nout and try to find someone who had taken a child, that it would help \nsave these children.\n  In fact, we have found that AMBER Alerts have been so effective that \nan abductor who saw an AMBER Alert sign in California went to the side \nof the road and let the child out because he knew he was going to be \ncaught and that he was in trouble. So it is very effective.\n  What we want to do is have a Coordinator in the Justice Department \nwho a local law enforcement official can call and not have to make 10 \ncalls to contiguous States. He or she can make that one call to the \nAMBER Alert Coordinator in the Justice Department. That person will \nthen be able to put the word out in contiguous States, without having \nto go through different call lists and wasting time.\n  We know that time saves lives in AMBER Alerts. When a child is \nabducted, if we can save time, we can give that child the chance to not \nbe harmed or horribly murdered, as we have seen in so many instances \nwith child abductions.\n  It is hard for me to understand how someone could prey on a \ndefenseless child. It is the worst nightmare a parent would have to \nhear, that her child or his child has been taken by a stranger and you \ndon't know what has happened. I have met with the parents of Elizabeth \nSmart, the wonderful couple from Utah, who have lost their child to an \nabductor and still have not heard from her. The agony they must go \nthrough every day is something no parent can imagine.\n  With this bill, we will put the coordinator in place. We will help \nset criteria for when an AMBER Alert would go out. We thank the \nNational Association of Broadcasters and the local broadcasters \nassociations because they voluntarily put the word out through radio \nand television in a community where this has occurred.\n  We want to make that go further and wider. We also want to try to \nhelp States with signage and help them know what works. For instance, \nthe blinking signs on highways have been very effective.\n  This is a bill that will make a difference. We know that if we can \nfind a child within 24 hours, we have the best chance for them to be \nrecovered safely.\n  I thank Senator Feinstein, my cosponsor of this bill, and thank again \nSenators Hatch and Leahy for pushing this bill through the Judiciary \nCommittee in record time because we know this bill needs to be on the \nbooks.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I am very pleased the Senate is again \ntaking up and passing the AMBER Alert Network Act. I remember last year \nwhen Senator Hutchison would meet me coming in one door of the Senate \nand she would say: This bill is extremely important. Can we get it up \nand pass it.\n  And before I would get to the other door, Senator Feinstein would \ngrab me saying the same thing.\n  I went to the Judiciary Committee with it. I must say with the strong \nhelp and support of the then-ranking member, now chairman of the \ncommittee, Senator Hatch. In the course of just 1 week after we \nintroduced this, we held a hearing on the AMBER Alert bill. We passed \nit in the Judiciary Committee, and we passed it in the full Senate. \nThat is almost unheard of.\n  This is a case of what can happen in the Senate when people set aside \npolitical or partisan labels, work together and make sure something can \npass.\n  It was unfortunate that the House did not pass it but now we will \ngive them a chance. I am proud to join Senator Hutchison and Senator \nFeinstein as an original cosponsor of the legislation.\n  Senator Hutchison said it very well, the reasons for the legislation, \nas did Senator Hatch. I commend those Senators for their leadership. \nSenator Hutchison and Senator Feinstein have been absolutely dynamic in \nthis case. Because of their support, they made it possible for Senator \nHatch and I to get the unanimous support of the Judiciary Committee to \nmove this bill.\n  It has been credited with recovering 43 children nationwide; 84 \nmodified versions have been adopted in local, regional and Statewide \nlocations. And 33 States have a Statewide plan.\n  My home State of Vermont is not yet one of them, but this bill would \nhelp towns and counties in States such as mine to build and maintain \nthe AMBER Alert.\n  We spoke about how parents feel. I can imagine, when my children were \ngrowing up, the terrible fear that my wife and I would have had at the \ndisappearance of any one of them. I don't know how a parent or \ngrandparent gets through that. I don't know how members of the family \nget through it. The most vulnerable and most trusting part of our \nsociety is our children. Because they are the most vulnerable and the \nmost trusting, we, not only as legislators but as parents, as family \nmembers, owe a particular duty to them.\n  I know President Bush is ready to sign this bill as soon as it is \npassed by\n\n[[Page S1236]]\n\nboth bodies and goes to his desk. I urge all Senators to vote for it to \nsend a very clear message to the other body that we support it. It is a \nbipartisan bill. They would then pass it. The President will sign it.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I am pleased to support the National \nAmber Alert Network Act of 2003. I urge the House of Representatives to \ntake prompt action to pass this critical legislation and for the \nPresident to support it.\n  We have all heard the stories of parents who have found themselves \ntrying to find a child who has been abducted, while fearing serious \ninjury or even death. While local law enforcement officials work \ntirelessly to locate these children, the reality is that they are not \nalways able to find a child in time without the help of the public.\n  What has made the difference around the country in many communities \nis the Amber program, a system designed to get critical information to \nthe general public that might lead to locating a child and his or her \nabductor before the worst can happen.\n  The National Amber Alert Network Act of 2003 builds upon successful \nlocal programs and encourages other communities to develop Amber \nprograms. The National Amber Alert Network Act of 2003 would enhance \nlocal programs by giving State and local communities help in \napprehending an abductor who takes a child and then crosses State \nlines. In Wisconsin, there are three Amber programs in effect, in \nMadison, in La Crosse and in Green Bay. But, if a child is taken from \nWisconsin and brought across State lines to another State, the local \nAmber programs have no uniform way to get critical information from one \nState to another.\n  The National Amber Alert Network Act of 2003 would allow communities \nthe flexibility to develop Amber programs that are responsive to the \nneeds of their areas and provide Federal assistance and coordination \nfor local programs. The National Amber Alert Network Act would have the \nDepartment of Justice create a national coordinator to work on \ninterstate issues, develop voluntary minimum standards for the issuance \nand dissemination of Amber alerts, and provide matching grants for the \ndevelopment and enhancement of local Amber alert plans.\n  The cost of implementing the National Amber Alert Network Act of 2003 \nis small when we consider the price every parent and community must pay \nwhen children are not protected. I am hopeful the National Amber Alert \nNetwork Act will help local programs continue to reunite families and \napprehend their abductors.\n  (At the request of Mr. Leahy, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, today, the Senate will vote \non a bill that will save children's lives by expanding the existing \nAMBER Alert program nationwide.\n  I want to commend Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison for her continued \nleadership on this legislation. Her work on this bill has been \nextraordinary.\n  I also want give a special thanks to Senator Hatch, Chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, and to Senator Leahy, the Ranking Member, for \nputting the National Amber Alert Network Act on the fast track to the \nSenate Floor.\n  Senator Hutchison and I introduced the bill on January 9th, 2003. \nNow, just a couple of weeks later, we are voting on Senate passage. I \nam hopeful that this tidal wave of Senate support will carry over to \nthe House and we soon will have a national AMBER Alert law.\n  So what are AMBER Alerts? AMBER Alerts are official bulletins \ntransmitted over the airwaves to enlist the public's help in tracking \ndown child abductors fleeing a crime scene.\n  AMBER Alerts are such powerful tools because they can be issued \nwithin minutes of an abduction and reach a wide public audience.\n  Statistics show that children in the most dangerous abduction cases \nhave precious little time until their safety is compromised.\n  According to a study by the U.S. Department of Justice, 74 percent of \nchildren who were abducted, and later found murdered, are killed in the \nfirst hours after being taken.\n  Simply put, we need more AMBER Alerts because they may be the best \ntool law enforcement has to save kidnaped children facing imminent \ndanger.\n  The National AMBER Alert Network Act has three key components.\n  First, the legislation would authorize $20 million to the Department \nof Transportation and $5 million to the Department of Justice in FY \n2004 to provide grants for the development of AMBER Alert systems, \nelectronic message boards, and training and education programs in \nstates that do not have AMBER Alerts.\n  To date, AMBER Alert systems exist in 34 states and a total of 85 \nlocal, regional and state jurisdictions. This bill would help the \nexpansion of AMBER Alerts to new jurisdictions.\n  Second, the bill would build upon the President's Executive Order by \nauthorizing a national coordinator for AMBER Alerts in the Department \nof Justice to expand the network of AMBER Alert systems and to \ncoordinate the issuance of region-wide AMBER Alerts.\n  Third, the bill provides a framework for the Department of Justice to \nestablish minimum standards for the regional coordination of AMBER \nalerts. The Department of Justice, working with the National Center for \nMissing and Exploited Children and other private organizations with \nexpertise in this area, would build upon the best standards currently \nin place.\n  The effectiveness of AMBER Alerts depends on the continued judicious \nuse of the system so that the public does not grow to ignore the \nwarnings.\n  Furthermore, it is the specific intent of this bill not to interfere \nwith the operation of the 85 AMBER plans that are working today.\n  Participation in regional AMBER plans is voluntary, and any plan that \nwishes to go it alone may still do so.\n  I urge members to support this bill because AMBER Alerts have a \nproven track record.\n  Nationally, since 1996, the AMBER Alert has been credited with the \nsafe return of 43 children to their families, including one case in \nwhich an abductor reportedly released the child after hearing the alert \nhimself.\n  I would like to briefly describe two of these cases: the rescues of \n10-year-old Nichole Timmons from Riverside and four-year-old Jessica \nCortez from Los Angeles.\n  Last fall, Nichole Timmons and her mother Sharon attended a hearing \nof the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Technology, Terrorism, and \nGovernment Information on the AMBER Alert program.\n  In moving testimony, Sharon described how Nichole was abducted from \ntheir Riverside home on August 20, 2002 and how an AMBER Alert brought \nher daughter back to her within hours of the abduction.\n  In Nichole's case, an Alert was issued not just in California, but in \nNevada as well.\n  After learning about the Alert, a tribal police officer in Nevada \nspotted the truck of Nichole's abductor and stopped him within 24 hours \nof the abduction.\n  He was found with duct tape and a metal pipe. The AMBER Alert was the \nonly reason that Nichole was able to return home to her mother--safe.\n  I can't think of any testimony in support of a bill more powerful \nthan the sight of a mother sitting next to her daughter who she thought \nmight be gone forever.\n  The second case I want to mention is that of Jessica Cortez. Jessica \ndisappeared from Echo Park in Los Angeles on August 11, 2002.\n  But when Jessica's abductor took her to a clinic for medical care, \nreceptionist Denise Leon recognized Jessica from the AMBER Alert and \nnotified law enforcement.\n  Without the publicity generated by the Alert, Jessica could have been \nlost to her parents forever.\n  Through this legislation, we will extend to every corner of the \nnation a network of AMBER Alerts that will protect our children.\n  This program will increase the odds that an abducted child will \nreturn to his or her family safely.\n  But importantly, it will deter potential abductors from taking a \nchild in the first place.\n  As Marc Klaas said at a hearing on the bill last fall, this \nlegislation will ``save kid's lives.''\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I yield back whatever time remains on \nthis side.\n\n[[Page S1237]]\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I yield back whatever time we have, and I \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the passage of the bill.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

I ask for the yeas and nays on that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. For the information of the Senate, this is the LIHEAP \namendment. The statements concerning the amendment will be after--\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that there be 1 \nminute for myself and Senator Collins to explain the amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, that would be in order. I have no \nproblem with that. I ask for 1 minute on each side to explain this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, this amendment would direct the President \nto release $300 billion for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance \nProgram. It will be offset by using unexpended emergency LIHEAP funds \nwhich were already appropriated in the 2001 Supplemental Appropriations \nAct. Today, as the temperatures freeze, people throughout the country--\npeople in the Northeast, the Midwest, many parts of the country--are \nfreezing. This includes low-income seniors. With rising oil prices, a \ndeclining economy, and cold temperatures, it is the ``perfect storm'' \nfor those people. We can help them with this amendment.\n  The amendment will also provide assistance to address the scorching \nheats of summer in other parts of the country. I urge passing.\n  I yield the remaining time to my colleague Senator Collins.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, when I left Maine earlier today, the \nforecast was for temperatures with a wind chill of 40 below zero \ntonight. We are facing a ``perfect storm'' of exceedingly cold winter \nweather, high energy prices, and a difficult economy.\n  This amendment is a modest amendment with very little budget impact. \nBut it is an amendment that will make a real difference in the lives of \nlow-income families in Maine and States across the Nation.\n  No one should have to choose between being warm in the winter, buying \nprescription drugs, or buying the food they need to remain healthy. \nThis amendment will address the needs of thousands of low-income \nfamilies across this Nation so that they will not be faced with those \nchoices.\n  Madam President, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. We are prepared to accept this amendment, but I think \nthe sponsors wish a vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it was my hope that we could debate and \nvote on the confirmation of the Ridge nomination during today's \nsession. It is my understanding that the other side of the aisle will \nrequire approximately an hour and 40 minutes for debate. In a \ndiscussion a few minutes ago, we agreed that we would at least begin \nthat debate tonight.\n  Shortly, I will be asking for unanimous consent to outline what the \nproposal is.\n  It is an important nomination. I believe all of us would like to \naddress and vote on the nomination as soon as possible. We will be \nconducting that vote tomorrow.\n  I encourage our colleagues who have statements to make those tonight, \nif at all possible.\n  As in executive session, I ask unanimous consent that following the \nstacked votes on Wednesday morning, the Senate proceed to executive \nsession for the consideration of Calendar No. 1, the nomination of Tom \nRidge to be Secretary of Homeland Security. Further, I ask that the \ndebate time be limited as follows: Senator Dorgan, 15 minutes; Senator \nByrd, 15 minutes; Senator Carper, 15 minutes; Senator Feinstein, 10 \nminutes; Senator Lautenberg, 20 minutes; Senator Lieberman, 15 minutes; \nSenator Daschle, 10 minutes; and Senator Collins to be in control of 1 \nhour and 40 minutes. I further ask unanimous consent that following the \nuse or yielding back of the debate time the Senate proceed to a vote on \nthe confirmation of the nomination with no intervening action or \ndebate; further, that following the vote, the President be immediately \nnotified of the Senate's action and the Senate then resume legislative \nsession.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, if I could, \nthrough the Chair, direct a question to the majority leader, it is my \nunderstanding that the majority leader is contemplating two votes in \nthe morning.\n  Mr. FRIST. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. And once that consent is done, it is my understanding we \nwould have a couple votes, is that right, at 9:15 or 9:30 in the \nmorning. Following that, this debate would take place, and we would \nvote on this matter prior to the normal party caucuses; is that right?\n  Mr. FRIST. That is correct. I understand that Senator Carper may be \nwilling to use his time tonight. I would encourage others to do so, \nonce the unanimous consent request is agreed to. Shortly, we will enter \ninto an agreement for two stacked votes for tomorrow morning at \napproximately 9:30. Following those votes, we will begin consideration \nof the Ridge nomination. I expect the vote will occur prior to the \npolicy luncheons tomorrow afternoon, as outlined.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the second \nvote tomorrow morning be a 10-minute vote.\n\n[[Page S1239]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I remind my colleagues that late nights are \nto be expected for the remainder of this week as we continue to work \nthrough amendments to the appropriations bill. I believe the amendments \nhave been filed at this juncture. I look forward to having the \nopportunity of looking through the amendments so we can give our \ncolleagues a better idea of the schedule over the course of this week. \nIt is my hope we will be able to complete the bill this week as early \nas possible. I think after looking over the amendments that have been \ngiven to the managers we will have a much better idea in that regard.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Collins be \nyielded 10 minutes at this juncture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing Senators be added as cosponsors to the LIHEAP amendment just \nadopted: Senators Grassley, Specter, Lieberman, Kohl, Baucus, and \nLincoln.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, Senator Jack Reed and I have offered an amendment that \nprovides for the immediate release of $300 million in funds for the Low \nIncome Home Energy Assistance Program, also known as LIHEAP.\n  I thank the chair and ranking member of the Labor-HHS Appropriations \nSubcommittee, Senators Specter and Harkin, for their efforts in support \nof this critical program. Despite the extremely difficult fiscal \nconstraints facing our Nation, Senators Specter and Harkin have managed \nto provide $1.7 billion in regular-year LIHEAP funds in the Omnibus \nAppropriations Act. This is $300 million more than the administration's \nrequest.\n  Unfortunately, while the bill before us provides more regular LIHEAP \nfunds than the administration requested, the total funding, which \nincludes both regular funding and emergency funding, is considerably \nless than was provided in fiscal year 2002. In fact, total LIHEAP \nfunding in this bill falls $300 million below the total funding \nprovided in fiscal year 2002. It is also $300 million below the total \nfunds provided in the Labor-HHS appropriations bill which passed the \nSenate Appropriations Committee on July 18, 2002, by a vote of 29 to 0.\n  Mr. President, the amendment that Senator Reed of Rhode Island and I \nhave offered would provide for the immediate release of an additional \n$300 million for low-income heating assistance by designating emergency \nfunds provided in the Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2001 as \nregular-year funds for fiscal year 2003.\n  For that reason, our amendment is fiscally responsible. Because these \nfunds were already made available, our amendment does not increase \ntotal spending in the omnibus appropriations bill. These are funds that \nwere already approved. The effect of our amendment is for this $300 \nmillion to be released immediately.\n  Some might argue that these funds should not be released unless the \nPresident declares an emergency. Anyone who thinks that we don't \ncurrently have an emergency in home heating assistance should visit \nwith a low-income family in Houlton, ME. Houlton recently experienced \nthe coldest temperature of any place in the lower 48 States. A few days \nago, temperatures in Houlton were 19 degrees below zero. Tonight, the \nforecast, with windchill, is for the temperature range to be from 20 to \n40 below in some parts of my home State. When the temperature is that \ncold, and you do not have money in your budget to heat your home, that \nis an emergency.\n  Adding to the problem of exceptionally cold winter weather, energy \nprices have escalated dramatically. The cessation of oil exports from \nVenezuela, as well as the prospect of a war in the Middle East, have \npushed the price of crude oil up by nearly $6 per barrel in the last \nmonth. Home heating oil inventories are near 5-year lows, and prices \nare 20 percent higher than last winter. The Energy Information \nAdministration predicts that home heating oil prices could rise 45 \npercent by the time winter is over. The price of natural gas, kerosene, \nand other fuels are facing similar pressures.\n  In addition to a cold winter and high energy prices, we are also \nfacing difficult economic times. Unemployment has reached an 8-year \nhigh. In Maine, as in many States, low-income and unemployed workers \nare struggling. Just last week, Great Northern Paper, the largest \nemployer in northern Maine, filed for bankruptcy and laid off its \nworkforce of more than 1,000 employees.\n  In short, we are facing a ``perfect storm'' of high energy prices, \nexceedingly cold weather, and a difficult economy. With little prospect \nfor a quick resolution of the crises in Iraq and Venezuela, continued \nforecasts for a cold winter, and the dubious prospects for a very quick \neconomic rebound, all of us living in cold weather climates will face \nchallenges in order to heat our homes this winter.\n  This combination of factors strains everyone's pocketbook, but, of \ncourse, it places a particular burden on seniors living on limited \nincomes and on our low-income families. These families already carry a \nhigher energy burden than most Americans. They can spend up to 20 or 25 \npercent of their entire income just paying their home energy bills. No \none should have to choose between heating their homes or putting food \non the table, having prescriptions in the medicine cabinet, or even \nstaying in their homes altogether.\n  Experience has shown, however, that pressures to pay energy bills and \nthe inability to pay have resulted in increased medical expenses for \nour elderly, malnutrition for our children, and even homelessness. As \nan indicator of just how difficult this winter has been in my home \nState, let me tell you that 10,000 more people in Maine have applied \nfor low-income heating assistance this year compared to last year.\n  Unfortunately, even as the need has increased, the amount of \nassistance has declined. In Maine, the average household benefit has \nseen a steady decline over the last four winters. In the winter of 1999 \nto 2000, the average LIHEAP benefit for a Maine family was $491. The \nnext year, it had fallen to $433. By last winter, the number had \nfurther declined to $358. Fortunately, with the approval of the Reed-\nCollins amendment, we can reverse this decline or at least ensure that \nmore Maine families will be helped; otherwise, low-income Maine \nfamilies struggling to heat their homes will only receive between $330 \nand $350 this winter, not nearly enough to help.\n  I would like to say a word about the history of the LIHEAP funds that \nour amendment addresses. The Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2001 \nprovided an extra $300 million in LIHEAP funds in order to help low \nincome families deal with high energy prices. Report language \nspecifically directed that at least $150 million of these funds were to \nbe used to address unmet needs resulting from high energy prices. The \nother half of the money was directed to be used to meet the most \ncritical needs arising from energy cost increases and increases in \nunemployment, among other things.\n  I have been working for the better part of 2 years to secure the \nrelease of these funds. On August 13, 2001, I joined Senator Reed, \nSenator Kennedy, and a number of my colleagues in sending a letter to \nthe President requesting the release of the very same $300 million in \nemergency funds from the fiscal year 2001 supplemental appropriations \nbill. On September 10, 2001, I again joined many of my colleagues in \nsending a letter to OMB director Mitch Daniels requesting the immediate \nrelease of these funds. On October 26, 2001, 17 Senators joined Senator \nReed and me in a letter to the Senate Minority and Majority leader \nrequesting legislative language to require the release of these funds. \nOn October 30, 2001, I offered an amendment to the fiscal year 2002 \nLabor, Health and Human Services appropriations bill expressing the \nsense of the Senate that these funds should be released immediately. \nThat amendment was supported by Senators Specter and Harkin and passed \nthe Senate as part of the fiscal year 2002 Labor-HHS bill.\n\n[[Page S1240]]\n\n  On February 12, 2002, I joined my colleague Senator Snowe in sending \na letter to the President again requesting the release of these same \nfunds. On September 23, 2002, Senator Reed and I were joined by Senator \nSpecter, Senator Harkin, and 35 of our colleagues in a letter to the \nPresident requesting the release of $200 million in emergency funds \nthat were made available as part of the fiscal year 2002 Labor-HHS \nAppropriations Bill. These funds expired without ever being spent. \nFinally, on December 23, 2002, half of our colleagues joined Senator \nReed and me in sending a letter to the administration requesting a \ntotal of $2 billion in fiscal year 2003 funding--which is the same \namount made available by combining the $300 million in my amendment \nwith the $1.7 billion already in the bill.\n  The LIHEAP program is essential in helping many low-income families \nget through the winter months. This has been an unusually cold winter. \nThis has been a year where home heating prices have soared. This has \nbeen a year where the economy has been difficult. The combination of \nthose three factors calls out for us to provide this additional \nassistance.\n  I am very pleased that our colleagues have joined together with an \noverwhelming vote. I hope very much this provision will be retained in \nthe final conference report.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about \nthe HUD/VA appropriations bill contained in the omnibus package \ncurrently under consideration by the Senate. I want to commend Senators \nMikulski and Bond for recognizing the importance of providing Americans \nwith the opportunity to live in decent, safe, and affordable housing. \nHowever, despite their efforts, housing programs suffer from a lack of \nadequate funding in this bill.\n  The Appropriations Committee faced tough choices in revising their \nfiscal year 2003 bills, due to the decision to cut domestic programs \nsubstantially across the board. Senate appropriations were forced to \ncut almost $10 billion from their earlier spending decisions for fiscal \nyear 2003. More than $1 billion of this cut comes from critical housing \nprograms. While the Senate bill before us today is far superior to the \nHouse appropriations bill, it does not provide adequate resources. Now \nis not the time to cut $1 billion from the social safety net. Over \n100,000 people lost their jobs last month, and unemployment continues \nto be high. Working families deserve our support, and instead of \nproviding it to them, we continue to cut programs that help people \nprovide for their families.\n  While the administration is asking us to provide a tax cut of $674 \nbillion, primarily for the wealthiest Americans, over $1 billion in \nfunding is being cut from programs that help low-income families afford \nhousing. The problem of affordable housing has become a crisis for many \nworking families all across America. According to a recent study, 14 \npercent of families pay over half of their income in rent or live in \nsubstandard housing. The significant gap between the wages of low-\nincome workers and housing costs makes evident that housing assistance \nis necessary for many working families. On average, a family in this \ncountry needs to earn almost $15 an hour to afford a modest two-bedroom \napartment. This is almost three times the minimum wage.\n  When millions of American families are unable to afford decent and \nsafe housing, the consequences are serious and far-reaching. When \nchildren do not have stable home environments, their health suffers as \ndoes their educational attainment. In addition, housing assistance can \nhelp people transition from welfare to work. Recent studies have found \nthat people leaving welfare who receive housing assistance retain \nemployment for longer and make more than those who do not receive such \nassistance. Unfortunately, this bill does not do enough to ensure that \nworking and elderly families in this country can afford safe and decent \nhousing.\n  Just last week, HUD announced that housing authorities around the \ncountry will be facing drastic cuts in their operating funding. These \ncuts are due to HUD's error in estimating public housing needs. Because \nof HUD's mistake, there was a $250 million shortfall in the operating \nfund in fiscal year 2002. Upon learning of this shortfall, HUD \nindicated that it would seek additional funding from Congress. \nUnfortunately, HUD never asked for these funds. Instead, HUD will use \nfiscal year 2003 funds; to make up for the shortfall. This means that \nwe are starting out with a $250 million cut in the program this year. \nThis cut will leave housing authorities with no choice but to \nscale back their programs, lay off staff and put off needed repairs.\n\n  HUD should request, and we should provide additional funding to make \nsure that families in public housing are adequately housed. In \naddition, HUD must provide as much funding as possible to PHAs under \nthe current budget situation. Housing authorities are currently \nreceiving only 70 percent of their funding. This is an unnecessary and \nirresponsible cut. Even assuming a loss of $250 million from fiscal \nyear 2003 funds, HUD should be able to provide at least 90 percent of \noperating costs to public house authorities. If HUD intends to fund \npublic housing at higher levels later in the year, as they have \nannounced, they should do so now, thereby helping PHAs avoid \nunnecessarily cutting off assistance to needy families.\n  In addition to under-funding the public housing operating account, \nthe HUD appropriations bill cuts $160 million from the Public Housing \nCapital Fund, which is used to repair and modernize public housing. \nOver 1.5 million families reside in public housing, housing that is \ngenerally safe and decent. However, this older housing stock is in need \nof constant maintenance. Capital needs in public housing grow by $2.3 \nbillion every year, and the backlog of needed capital repairs is over \n$20 billion. If we do not adequately fund the Public Housing Capital \nFund, this backlog will continue to grow, threatening the homes of 1.5 \nmillion American families and the Federal Government's substantial \ninvestment in this housing.\n  While I strongly oppose the cuts in the public housing program, there \nare some important provisions contained in this bill that I \nwholeheartedly support. This bill fixes a serious problem created by \nthe House Committee and ensures that Section 8 housing vouchers, a \ncritical housing resource, are not lost. The House appropriations bill, \nH.R. 5605, will result in the immediate loss of over 125,000 vouchers \nand will lead to the continued loss of housing vouchers over time. \nThough the bill before us today cuts funding from the voucher program, \nit does so in a way that guarantees that all vouchers in use will be \nfunded, and ensures that housing authorities can serve as many families \nas possible with the vouchers they are allocated. This is an important \nprovision, and I want to commend Senators Bond and Mikulski for \nincluding this in the HUD/VA appropriations bill.\n  I am also pleased that the Senate retains $100 million in interest \nreduction payments for housing uses. Unfortunately, the House bill \ncomplies with the administration's request to rescind this $100 million \nwhich should be used to rehabilitate affordable housing. Given the \ngreat need for housing around the country, it is remarkable that we \nwould rescind funding which could be used to increase housing \nopportunities. The Senate bill rightly requires that HUD use these \nfunds to modernize affordable housing. Unfortunately, HUD has refused \nto take any action to use these IRP funds for their intended purpose, \nand I urge HUD to quickly comply with congressional intent and \ndistribute these needed dollars.\n  Affordable, stable housing is the bedrock of stable, vibrant \ncommunities. Unfortunately, too many Americans find themselves in \nprecarious housing situations in neighborhoods of despair. The \ncontinued cuts to housing programs supported by the current \nadministration will hurt the millions of Americans who live in public \nhousing or received housing vouchers, and the millions more Americans \nwho are in need of housing assistance. These cuts will be felt all \naround the country. I hope that the administration will recognize this \nand the growing housing needs around the country and I urge them to \nfully fund Federal housing programs in the fiscal year 2004 budget. I \nam also hopeful that the Senate bill, which ensures the viability of \nthe housing voucher program, prevails at conference with the House.\n\n\n                           democracy programs\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the ranking member of the Foreign \nOperations Subcommittee and I intended to\n\n[[Page S1241]]\n\ninclude the following section in the report accompanying the FY 2003 \nForeign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs \nappropriations bill. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the \nRecord following the remarks of the Senator from Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. My friend from Kentucky and I agreed to include this \nsection in the report, but we regret that it was not included before \nthe report hit the printing presses. It is our hope and expectation \nthat it be considered as if included in the fiscal year 2003 Foreign \nOperations report, as originally printed in the Record last week.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                  Democracy Oversight and Coordination\n\n       The Committee strongly supports programs and activities \n     that advance democracy and freedom abroad, and has included \n     funding in this Act for specific democracy programs it \n     believes are important to United States security interests. \n     The Committee believes that democracy promotion abroad can be \n     an effective bulwark against terrorism, if properly \n     established and implemented.\n       However, the Committee remains concerned with the \n     inconsistent application of democracy programs by State and \n     USAID, and the apparent lack of coordination of these \n     programs within, and between, the agencies. For example, \n     while the Committee applauds State's comprehensive review of \n     Middle East democracy programs, it is perplexed by its lack \n     of leadership and support for the advancement of democracy in \n     Burma.\n       In order to address these concerns, the Committee \n     recommends that State and USAID jointly conduct a \n     comprehensive review of democracy programs, and consider \n     centralizing oversight and coordination within the Bureau of \n     Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. The Committee will review \n     the progress made in this endeavor as it considers action on \n     the fiscal year 2004 foreign operations appropriations bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/21/senate-section/article/S1241-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1241-S1242]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NOMINATION OF GOVERNOR RIDGE\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, apparently within the next 24 hours we \nwill have the opportunity to vote on the President's nominee to head \nour new Department of Homeland Security. The President has made an \nexcellent choice. It is hard for me to imagine a better choice to \nundertake this responsibility than Governor Ridge.\n  Twenty years ago this month, Governor Ridge and I stood with about 80 \nother freshmen Congressmen and women at the other end of this building \nand raised our right hand and took an oath of office to defend our \nConstitution and country. He and I then served together in the House \nfor the next 10 years and actually helped to lead one of the Banking \nCommittee subcommittees as ranking Democrat and Republican.\n  Later we served as Governors in the neighboring States of \nPennsylvania and Delaware. Even before we came to Washington, we served \nin the Armed Forces of our country where he served with real \ndistinction in the U.S. Army during the Vietnam war.\n  I will always be especially grateful for a breakfast Governor Ridge \ncame to almost 20 years ago. I had just been elected the at large \nCongressman from Delaware and ended the campaign with a little bit of \ndebt. We decided to have a fundraising breakfast to help take care of \nthe debt, and Senator Biden, then the junior Senator from Delaware, was \ngood enough to come and speak at our breakfast. We had a whole host of \nDemocratic colleagues from the House, new freshmen who wanted to show \ntheir support for their new colleague. One Republican stopped by that \nbreakfast, and it was the freshman Congressman from Erie, PA.\n  I will always be grateful for that appearance and for the friendship \nthat has spanned some 20 years. I will be pleased to vote with my \ncolleagues and join, I suspect all of them, in making him a unanimous \nchoice for Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security.\n  While I believe Governor Ridge is more than qualified for the job, \nthe task he faces is daunting. Congress has given him a Department that \nat least on paper should be able to prevent and respond to terrorist \nattacks more effectively than Federal Government and State governments \ncan today. We have authorized the transfers of literally dozens of \nagencies and tens of thousands of workers. We have outlined a skeleton \norganization that should be able to pull together under one roof \ninformation on threats and vulnerabilities and to use that information \nto improve security and better prepare our first responders.\n  Very little of what we have outlined, though, will be in place on day \n1, and day 1 is tomorrow for all intents and purposes. A number of \noutstanding questions remain. Both in the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs where I serve and on the Senate floor, we have had a healthy \ndebate over the details of how the transition to a new Department of \nHomeland Security should work. I know some of my colleagues are \nuncomfortable with what we have. I have a few concerns of my own.\n  That being said, I think it is important now that we put aside our \ndisagreements and do what we need to do to enable this Department to do \nwhat it needs to do, to protect American lives.\n  Let me take a few minutes to discuss a couple of the issues I hope \nGovernor Ridge will address early on during his tenure as Secretary of \nthis Department.\n  First, let me touch on the subject of rail security. Now that the \nTransportation Security Administration has for the most part achieved \nthe goals we set for them, it is time for them and for the Department \nof Homeland Security to focus on other modes that have received less \nattention, especially rail. As I said before, our failure more than a \nyear after September 11 to act to improve the security of our rail \ninfrastructure is an Achilles' heel in our Nation's effort to secure \nour total transportation system.\n\n  In New York City today, hundreds of thousands of people on their way \nto work pass through tunnels that are badly lit, poorly ventilated, and \nfrom which escape is very difficult. In fact, there is even a rail \ntunnel that goes under the Supreme Court and congressional offices just \na couple of hundred yards from where we are gathered this evening. \nEvery day thousands of people pass through that tunnel under this \nCapitol on their way to work or to home.\n  Passenger safety demands a real investment, but to ask Amtrak to do \nmore with respect to security without providing more resources is, in \nmy view, an unfunded mandate, not a solution. I thank Governor Ridge \nfor understanding the importance of improving rail security, not just \nfor passenger rail but for freight rail as well.\n  I also thank Governor Ridge for acknowledging at our hearing last \nweek that Amtrak is likely to need some additional financial \nassistance, if it is expected to make the security enhancements that \nneed to be made.\n  Let me also touch on the matter of first responders. States and \nlocalities are in desperate need of additional new resources to help \nprepare their police, their fire, and emergency personnel for any \nfuture terrorist attacks. At the same time, most State and local \ngovernments are suffering through extraordinary fiscal crises that are \nforcing some to raise taxes or cut services. We see that in Delaware, \nin Tennessee, and a host of other States as well.\n  I am disappointed that the omnibus appropriations bill on the floor \nthis evening and today and again tomorrow probably does not provide \nState and localities with the level of first responder aid that they \nneed. In the future, I hope Governor Ridge, soon to be Secretary Ridge, \nand our colleagues in Congress and the President will heed the calls \nfrom back home for more first responder aid.\n  I also hope Governor Ridge works quickly in the coming weeks to set \nup a communications link between the new Department and first \nresponders so their needs can be heard and information on what they \nneed to do to protect their communities makes its way down to them.\n  When the Committee on Governmental Affairs first marked up the \nHomeland Security Act and again when a modified version of the bill \nreached the floor, Senators Collins and Feingold and I offered an \namendment to create an office of State and local coordination within \nthe new Department. That would place a homeland security liaison office \nwithin each State. Our language, unfortunately, was not included in the \nfinal bill, but I do hope Governor Ridge will consider setting up \nsomething like what we recommended once this new Department is in place \nand he and his employees have gotten their sea legs.\n\n[[Page S1242]]\n\n  I want to close with some comments on relations with employees. A \nmatter that held up final passage of this legislation when we created \nthe new Department last month was really relations with employees, what \nkinds of rights they have under the collective bargaining laws and \nunder the merit rules of the civil service rules of our country.\n  Recently, ADM James Loy, head of the Transportation Security \nAdministration--I am told a very able person--used the authority \nCongress granted him under the airline security legislation we passed \nafter September 11 to forbid airport screeners from joining unions. He \ncited his view that the screeners perform sensitive national security \nwork as the reason for his decision.\n  The admiral's decision may or may not have been the right one. \nWhether it was or not, it has not done much to improve relations \nbetween the administration and thousands of unionized employees who are \nbeing transferred to this new Department, who perform work just as \nsensitive as--or in some cases even more sensitive than--that performed \nby the screeners.\n  As he works with the Office of Personnel Management to develop a \nhuman resources management system for this new Department, I urge \nGovernor Ridge to work swiftly to repair the strained relationship \nbetween the administration and the public employees' union. He will \nbenefit by doing that, the employees of that Department will benefit, \nand I believe our Nation will, too.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

In the last Congress Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Act, a bill that would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence \nof any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred May 3, 2001 \nin Los Angeles, CA. An African-American man was shot by an Hispanic \nman, Carlos Garcia. Garcia shot and critically wounded the victim after \ntelling him that he ``did not like black men associating with Hispanic \nwomen,'' according to police. After the incident, the gunman hijacked a \nbus and caused a deadly crash as he was fleeing from police.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/21/senate-section/article/S1242-4", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1242]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO JENNIFER CHARTRAND\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Mr. President, it is my pleasure to rise in \ntribute to the University of Connecticut Huskies women's basketball \nteam, which on Saturday, January 18th made Division I history by \nwinning their 55th consecutive game. In doing so, they surpassed the \n54-game streak set by Virginia Tech between 1980 and 1982 and delighted \nfans all across my state.\n  Fifty-five straight wins would be an incredible accomplishment in any \nsport at any time. But it's especially impressive in women's college \nbasketball today because this is an era of true parity in the sport. \nThere are so many strong teams able to compete with and, on any given \nnight, beat a great team like the Huskies. But the Huskies keep on \nworking, and they keep on winning, at home and on the road, in blowouts \nand in squeakers. Sometimes they win with defense. Sometimes with \nthree-point shooting. Sometimes with pure hustle. But they always find \na way.\n  It's no wonder the Huskies have an admirer in legendary UCLA coach \nJohn Wooden, whose UCLA men's basketball teams in the early 1970's set \nan all-time Division I record with 88 straight wins. Coach Wooden said \nof what the Huskies have accomplished, ``It's a tremendous feat in any \nera. I think they play the pure game, more so than the men. The best \ncollege basketball in my opinion is played by the better women's \nteams.''\n  Of course, last year the very best team in the nation was UConn, \nwhich racked up a perfect 39-0 season en route to the national \nchampionship. The players on that team--led by All-American seniors Sue \nBird, Tamika Williams, Swin Cash and Asjha Jones--built the bulk of \nthis record streak.\n  And this season, a team led by All-American junior Diana Taurasi and \nmany terrific young players is in the hunt for the championship again. \nThere will be tons of tough games to play. Just this Monday, January \n20th, they matched up against Notre Dame and extended the streak to 56. \nAnd on February 1st, they will play Duke, now ranked first in the \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, competition isn't about perfection. It's about \nperseverance. I'm reminded of the words of Michael Jordan, who said, \n``I have missed more than 9,000 shots in my career. I have lost almost \n300 games. On 26 occasions I have been entrusted to take the game \nwinning shot . . . and I missed. I have failed over and over and over\n\n[[Page S1243]]\n\nagain in my life. And that's precisely why I succeed.'' So even if--\nif--the team should lose someday, the real measure of their character \nwill be how they bounce back, what they learn, how they become an even \nbetter team because of it.\n  So much of the credit for this team's success goes to coach Geno \nAuriemma, who has built the best program in the Nation during his 18 \nyears in Storrs. Assistant Coach Chris Dailey has also played a pivotal \npart in the remarkable run. The Huskies have won three national \nchampionships over the last 7 years. They have made 14 straight NCAA \ntournament appearances and won a combined 23 Big East regular and \ntournament championships. Over the last 3 years, they've amassed an \nastounding 123-4 record.\n  I wish them luck in the weeks and months to come as they seek to \nextend the streak further. This has been a month of history in women's \ncollege basketball. Tennessee coach Pat Summit just won her 800th \ngame--and the Huskies won their 55th straight victory. It is a golden \ntime for the sport, and for all the fans who love it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/21/senate-section/article/S1243-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1243]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  BILL ROSENDAHL'S 15TH ANNIVERSARY AS A HOST AND PRODUCER AT ADELPHIA\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today in honor of Bill \nRosendahl, who has just marked his 15th anniversary of producing a \nvariety of shows for Adelphia Communications. I would like to take a \nfew moments to recognize Bill's many successes.\n  I have been a guest on Bill's shows many times. Recently I appeared \non his ``One-on-One'' interview program and enjoyed a discussion with \nBill ranging from the possible war in Iraq to our Nation's environment \nand energy policies. Bill is extremely knowledgeable about issues \nfacing our Nation and world. His questions are intelligent, insightful, \nand penetrating.\n  Since 1987, Bill has produced 2,600 shows. For 15 years, viewers have \ntuned in to watch interviews with leaders including former Vice \nPresident Al Gore, my colleague Senator Dianne Feinstein, California \nGovernor Gray Davis, Prince El Hassan Bin Talal of Jordan, and former \nPrime Minister of Israel Ehud Barak.\n  In addition to his role at Adelphia, Bill serves as Chairman of the \nCalifornia Cable Telecommunications Association, Chairman of the \nCalifornia Commission on Tax Policy in the New Economy, and on boards \nof the California Channel and Cable Positive.\n  Prior to his career in the cable industry, Bill Rosendahl was a White \nHouse appointee to the State Department as Chief of Operations for the \nU.S. Trade and Development Program and an associate in philanthropic \nwork for John D. Rockefeller III. He has been involved in many \npresidential, gubernatorial, and senatorial campaigns. Bill has also \ntraveled to more than 50 countries throughout the world.\n  It is clear that Bill Rosendahl deserves our warmest wishes on this \nspecial occasion. Because of Bill's work, Californians are more \ninformed about issues facing our State, Nation and world. He provides a \nforum for an engaging exchange of ideas, perspectives and outlooks on \nthe future. I am certain that the next 15 years will be just as \nexciting as the first.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/21/senate-section/article/S1243-2", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1243]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/21/senate-section/article/S1243-3", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1243]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/21/senate-section/article/S1243-4", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1243-S1245]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were referred \nas indicated:\n\n       EC-570.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow an \nincome tax credit for the provision of homeownership and community \ndevelopment, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today with Senators Stabenow and \nSantorum to introduce the New Homestead Economic Opportunity Act. This \nlegislation will create a single-family housing tax credit for \ndevelopers who build in low income areas, and allow more Americans to \nreach their dreams of homeownership. It will also encourage developers \nof single family units to invest in low income areas and improve our \ncommunities.\n  Currently, there are no tax credits available to developers of new or \nrehabilitated, affordable single-family housing. The low-income housing \ntax credit provides tax credits to owners of low-income rental units, \nbut does not provide a solution to the problem of a lack of affordable \nhomes. The quality of life in distressed neighborhoods can be improved \ndramatically by increasing home ownership. Existing buildings in these \nneighborhoods often need extensive renovation before they can provide \ndecent owner-occupied housing. It is also difficult for renovations to \noccur because the costs involved exceed the prices at which the housing \nunits could be sold. Similarly, the costs of new construction may \nexceed its market value. Properties sit vacant and neighborhoods remain \ndevastated. The New Homestead Economic Opportunity Act bridges the gap \nbetween development costs and market prices and will revitalize these \nareas.\n  Our legislation will create a single-family housing tax credit of \n$1.75 per resident which will be made available annually to States. In \nmy home State of Oregon, the most recent Census estimates State or \nlocal housing credit agencies will award these credits to housing \nunits, including condominiums and cooperatives planned for development \nof single-family housing in census tracts with median incomes of 80 \npercent or less of area median income. The value of the credits could \nnot exceed 50 percent of the qualifying cost of the unit. Rules similar \nto the current law rules for the Low Income Housing Tax Credit will \napply to determine eligible costs of individual units.\n  The owner of the housing unit being sold to a qualified buyer will be \neligible to claim the single-family housing tax credit over a 5-year \nperiod beginning on that date. Eligible home buyers must have incomes \nat 80 percent or less of applicable median family income. They would \nnot have to be first time homebuyers, and rules similar to the mortgage \nrevenue bond provisions will apply to determine applicable median \nfamily income.\n  In Oregon, rising housing costs are prohibiting working families from \nbeing able to afford homes. With a lack of affordable housing, costs \nare rising, and families are unable to gain the stability and equity \nhomeownership provides. In its first year, the New Homestead Economic \nOpportunity Act would support more than 360 new affordable homes, \nprobably more if credits are used in connection with less costly \nrehabilitations. A family of three or more with an income of $30,000 \nwill be a qualified buyer in Oregon. This legislation will affect real \nworking Americans.\n  I am proud to sponsor this legislation that will further the dream of \nso many Americans through homeownership. I urge my colleagues to join \nme in supporting the New Homestead Economic Opportunity Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the New Homestead Economic Opportunity \nAct be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 198\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Canadian transboundary movement of municipal solid \n              waste.''.\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator Levin \nin reintroducing this bill to address the growing problem of Canadian \nwaste shipments to Michigan.\n  In 2001, Michigan imported almost 3.6 million tons of municipal solid \nwaste, more than double the amount that was imported in 1999. This \ngives Michigan the unwelcome distinction of being the third largest \nimporter of waste in the United States.\n  My colleagues may be surprised to know that the biggest source of \nthis waste was not another state, but our neighbor to the north, \nCanada. More than half the waste that was shipped to Michigan in 2001 \nwas from Ontario, Canada, and these imports are growing rapidly. On \nJanuary 1, 2003, as another Ontario landfill closed its doors, the city \nof Toronto switched from shipping two-thirds of its trash, to shipping \nall of its trash, 1.1 million tons, to Michigan landfills. Experts \npredict that soon there will be virtually no local disposal capacity in \nOntario, which could mean even more waste being shipped across the \nborder to Michigan.\n  Not only does this waste dramatically decrease Michigan's own \nlandfill capacity, but it has a tremendous negative impact on \nMichigan's environment and the public health of its citizens. The \nCanadian waste also hampers the effectiveness of Michigan's State and \nlocal recycling efforts, since Ontario does not have a bottle law \nrequiring recycling.\n  Currently, 110-130 truckloads of waste come into Michigan each day \nfrom Canada. These trucks cross the Ambassador Bridge and Blue Water \nBridge and travel through the busiest parts of Metro Detroit, causing \ntraffic delays, and filling our air with the stench of exhaust and \ngarbage. These trucks also present a security risk at our Michigan-\nCanadian border, since by their nature trucks full of garbage are \nharder for Customs agents to inspect than traditional cargo.\n  Michigan already has protections contained in an international \nagreement between the United States and Canada, but they are being \nignored. Under the Agreement Concerning the Transboundary Movement of \nHazardous Waste, which was entered into in 1986, shipments of waste \nacross the Canadian-U.S. border require government-to-government \nnotification. The Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, as the \ndesignated authority for the United States would receive the \nnotification and then would have 30 days to consent or object to the \nshipment. Not only have these notification provisions not been \nenforced, but the EPA has indicated that they would not object to the \nmunicipal waste shipments.\n  This legislation will give Michigan residents the protection they are \nentitled to under this bilateral treaty. The bill would give EPA the \nauthority to implement and enforce this treaty, and would create civil \npenalties for those who ship waste in violation of the treaty. In \naddition, it would create criteria for the EPA's determination of \nwhether or not to consent to a shipment, such as the State's views on \nthe shipment, and the shipment's impact on landfill capacity, air \nemissions, public health and the environment. These waste shipments \nshould no longer be accepted without an examination of how it will \naffect the health and welfare of Michigan families.\n  Again, I thank my colleague, Senator Levin, for introducing this bill \nand I look forward to working with him to move it through the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/21/senate-section/article/S1250-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1250]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 24--DESIGNATING THE WEEK BEGINING MAY 4, 2003, AS \n         ``NATIONAL CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES WEEK''\n\n  Mr. BYRD (for himself and Mr. Sarbanes) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                               S.

HELPING CHILDREN SUCCEED BY FUNDING THE INDIVIDUALS \n                   WITH DISABILITIES EDUCATION ACT (IDEA).\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) All children deserve a quality education.\n       (2) In Pennsylvania Association for Retarded Children vs. \n     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (334 F. Supp. 1247)(E. Dist. Pa. \n     1971), and Mills vs. Board of Education of the District of \n     Columbia (348 F. Supp. 866)(Dist. D.C. 1972), the courts \n     found that children with disabilities are entitled to an \n     equal opportunity to an education under the 14th amendment of \n     the Constitution.\n       (3) In 1975, Congress passed what is now known as the \n     Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (referred to in \n     this section as ``IDEA'') (20 U.S.C. 1400 et seq.) to help \n     States provide all children with disabilities a free, \n     appropriate public education in the least restrictive \n     environment. At full funding, Congress contributes 40 percent \n     of the average per pupil expenditure for each child with a \n     disability served.\n       (4) Before 1975, only \\1/5\\ of the children with \n     disabilities received a formal education. At that time, many \n     States had laws that specifically excluded many children with \n     disabilities, including children who were blind, deaf, or \n     emotionally disturbed, from receiving such an education.\n       (5) IDEA currently serves an estimated 200,000 infants and \n     toddlers, 600,000 preschoolers, and 5,400,000 children 6 to \n     21 years of age.\n       (6) IDEA enables children with disabilities to be educated \n     in their communities, and thus, has assisted in dramatically \n     reducing the number of children with disabilities who must \n     live in State institutions away from their families.\n       (7) The number of children with disabilities who complete \n     high school has grown significantly since the enactment of \n     IDEA.\n       (8) The number of children with disabilities who enroll in \n     college as freshmen has more than tripled since the enactment \n     of IDEA.\n       (9) The overall effectiveness of IDEA depends upon well \n     trained special education and general education teachers, \n     related services personnel, and other school personnel. \n     Congress recognizes concerns about the nationwide shortage of \n     personnel serving students with disabilities and the need for \n     improvement in the qualifications of such personnel.\n       (10) IDEA has raised the Nation's awareness about the \n     abilities and capabilities of children with disabilities.\n       (11) Improvements to IDEA in the 1997 amendments increased \n     the academic achievement of children with disabilities and \n     helped them to lead productive, independent lives.\n       (12) Changes made in 1997 also addressed the needs of those \n     children whose behavior impedes learning by implementing \n     behavioral assessments and intervention strategies to ensure \n     that they receive appropriate supports in order to receive a \n     quality education.\n       (13) IDEA requires a full partnership between parents of \n     children with disabilities and education professionals in the \n     design and implementation of the educational services \n     provided to children with disabilities.\n       (14) While the Federal Government has more than doubled \n     funding for part B of IDEA since 1995, the Federal Government \n     has never provided more than 17 percent of the maximum State \n     grant allocation for educating children with disabilities.\n       (15) By fully funding IDEA, Congress will strengthen the \n     ability of States and localities to implement the \n     requirements of IDEA.\n\n     SEC. __.

We believe that local governments \n     should not have to bear that responsibility alone.\n       (3) Our homeland defense will only be as strong as the \n     weakest link at the State and local level. By providing our \n     communities with the resources and tools they need to bolster \n     emergency response efforts and provide for other emergency \n     response initiatives, we will have a better-prepared home \n     front and a stronger America.\n\n     SEC. 3.
