Mr. President, I will take a moment to comment on the \neconomic good news that does continue to roll in. After weeks of \npositive indicators, the latest economic reports show that the economy \nis steadily expanding. Specifically, new jobs are coming online and \nunemployment continues to fall. According to the latest payroll survey, \n112,000 new jobs were created in January, the largest monthly increase \nsince December of the year 2000. Fully 366,000 new jobs were added over \nthe last 5 months.\n  The national unemployment rate continues to decline. In general, the \nunemployment rate reached a level of 5.6 percent. That is the fastest \n7-month decline in over a decade. In fact, unemployment is now lower \nthan it was, on average, during the 1970s, during the 1980s, or the \n1990s. It is still too high and we will continue to work aggressively \nto lower that unemployment rate. However, with the fastest 7-month \ndecline in a decade, the trends are moving in the right direction.\n  The Council of Economic Advisers has other good news. On Monday, the \nCouncil released the latest economic report of the President. They \nanticipate the economy will create millions of new payroll jobs by the \nend of the year. They also emphasize that America is on a path to \nhigher sustained output for years to come.\n  A survey released in January by the U.S. Institute for Supply \nManagement found, for December, new orders booked by industry increased \nat their best rate in 50 years. The bottom line is the economy is \ngrowing, America is moving in the right direction. Contrary to its \ncritics, President Bush's tax cuts are working.\n  By passing the tax cuts, we were able to reduce the unemployment rate \nby nearly 1 extra percentage point. We have increased the number of \njobs available by as much as 2 million. And we have increased real GDP \nby as much as 3 percent. But there is still much to be done.\n  As we consider these positive numbers, we must also work to enact \npolicies that help every American who needs a job to find a job. We \nmust use the tools at our disposal to create the conditions which lead \nto job growth. That is one reason passing this highway bill is so \ncrucial.\n  Every $1 billion we invest in transportation infrastructure generates \nmore than $2 billion in economic activity. It also creates an \nadditional 47,500 new jobs. Our roads, our ports, and our railroads are \nvital to America's economic success. Indeed, it is estimated that the \nhighway bill will add a whopping 2 million jobs to the economy.\n\n[[Page S958]]\n\nThat is 2 million reasons to pass this bill this week.\n  Today and Thursday, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan is \nscheduled to deliver his monetary report to the Congress. Chairman \nGreenspan has expressed confidence that the economy will continue to \ngrow and to grow more jobs. While he does his important work at the \nFed, we must continue to do our work in this Chamber to bolster the \neconomy and help create jobs. Lowering health costs, reducing the \ndownward drag of frivolous lawsuits, ensuring affordable energy, \ncutting redtape, and opening new markets, all of these progrowth \npolicies will help keep America moving forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/11/senate-section/article/S958-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S958]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, 2 days ago President Bush sent to \nCongress his annual report on the State of America's economy. Contained \nin that report is a statement that was quite remarkable. After \npresiding over the loss of 2.6 million jobs, after claiming for 3 years \nthat stopping the job hemorrhage was one of their top priorities, the \nBush administration now says that exporting American jobs to China and \nIndia and other low-wage nations is good for the American economy.\n  I read that, and I must have read it two or three times thinking \nthere had to be a catch, thinking there had to be some caveat, there \nhad to be some condition. But there is no condition. The statement from \nthe report could not be more clear. This administration believes that \nexporting jobs to China and India and other low-wage nations is good \nfor America's economy. They seem to want to turn a jobless recovery \ninto a hopeless recovery.\n  The President's report is proof that there are those in this \nadministration who simply do not understand what is happening to this \neconomy and how deeply concerned people are about their economic \nfuture.\n  People who think shipping American jobs overseas is good for the \neconomy need to talk to people such as Myra Bronstein. She is not a \nstatistic. She is not an abstract concept on computer models.\n  Sometimes we focus so much on corporate stock earnings or the Dow \nJones Industrial Average, we lose sight of the challenges that real \nAmericans are actually facing. Myra Bronstein knows all about \noutsourcing. She has a degree in electronic engineering and 15 years of \nexperience in the information technology industry.\n\n  Four years ago, she left a good job with AT in New Jersey to take a \nnew job with a software development company called Watchmark \nCorporation in Bellevue, WA. She was one of about 20 software testers \nat Watchmark.\n  One Friday last April, Myra came to work. She and other software \ntesters were called into a meeting. They were told that they were being \nreplaced by workers in India, that their jobs would be gone as they \nfinished training their replacements, and that if they refused to train \nthe new workers they would be ineligible for severance pay, \nunemployment insurance, or health insurance through COBRA.\n  Then they were told that the new workers were flying in over the \nweekend and would be there on Monday. Most of her coworkers just had to \ntrain one new person. Because Myra Bronstein was working on the highest \npriority projects, she actually had to train two replacements. The \nwhole while she was trying frantically to figure out where she was \ngoing to find a new job in the midst of the ``dot-com'' bust and a \njobless recovery.\n  Myra Bronstein is not alone. According to a new national survey that \nis just being released today, nearly one in four information technology \nworkers said his or her company has offshored jobs. Incredibly, almost \none in five reported they themselves had lost a job after training a \nforeign worker. Ninety-three percent--nearly all--expressed concerns \nabout the impact of offshoring jobs on the IT industry and how it would \nimpact their communities, the economy, and this country. One-third of \nthe workers surveyed said the trend toward outsourcing and offshoring \njobs is contributing to layoffs. And more than half said it was pushing \ndown wages and benefits.\n  When textile manufacturing jobs started to move offshore in the \n1980s, workers in those industries were told that the change was good \nfor America's economy. They were told that all they had to do was to \nlearn some new skills, train for some ``new economy,'' and they could \nget better paying jobs in the technology and service industries.\n  Workers held up their end of the deal. They got the training. Many \ndid get jobs in the computer and IT industries, in health care and \nfinancial services, and other so-called new industries. Now these new \njobs are being shipped overseas.\n  We are offshoring America's future. We are exporting some of our \nNation's most promising research and development jobs. These are the \njobs that support middle-class families. They are the jobs that enable \npeople to own their own homes and put their kids through college.\n  Sixty-eight percent of IT workers have a college degree or higher. \nHalf have annual salaries between $75,000 and $125,000. Their jobs are \nbeing offshored to people who will earn less than $10,000.\n  This is not just happening in Seattle or Silicon Valley. It is \nhappening in Sioux Falls and St. Louis and cities and towns all across \nAmerica. Now the Bush administration tells us that exporting American \njobs is actually good for the economy.\n  Shipping good jobs overseas may boost the quarterly earnings of some \ncompanies. It may make some CEOs look smart and make some quick profit \nfor some investors. But how can it be good for the economy to export \nAmerica's best jobs? How can it be good for the economy to offshore the \njobs that support middle-class families and sustain strong communities? \nHow can exporting jobs create opportunities for Americans?\n\n  It is not just the jobs that get outsourced. When American companies \nship jobs offshore, they also send tax returns, medical records, credit \ncard numbers, financial statements, and all kinds of other sensitive \nand confidential consumer information.\n  America has lost 2.6 million jobs on this administration's watch. \nThat is more jobs than the last 11 administrations put together. Nine \nmillion Americans are now out of work. Long-term unemployment is at a \n20-year high.\n  Eighty-thousand workers are exhausting their unemployment benefits \nevery week because Republican leaders refuse to support extending the \nFederal emergency unemployment benefits.\n  The Economic Policy Institute recently found that in 48 States jobs \nare shifting from higher paying to lower paying industries.\n  In his State of the Union Message, President Bush said he understood, \nfinally, that we have a jobs problem in America. He promised his \nadministration would do more to help people find and train for jobs of \nthe future.\n  A few days later, a professor from the University of Texas wrote an \nop-ed in the Washington Post about what she said was a model job \ntraining program in Austin. Many of the students at the center do not \nhave the advantages that Myra Bronstein and many other IT workers have. \nThey do not have graduate degrees. What they do have is a fierce desire \nto make a better life for themselves and their children. Many of them \nhave two jobs. They catch a bus to their classes, where they learn \nabout computer programming and spreadsheets and other supposedly \nmarketable skills.\n  The professor wrote that one woman who showed her proudly how she \n``uses MapQuest.com to get directions to the houses that she cleans on \nher hands and knees, 7 days a week, 12 hours a day, for a pittance,'' \nwas just lucky to have a job at all.\n  She wrote:\n\n       Before they learned these skills, the trainees thought that \n     it was their lack of computer skills that prevented them from \n     getting good information-age jobs. They thought something was \n     wrong with them. Now they know something is wrong with our \n     job market.\n\n  There is something wrong with the job market, and the Bush \nadministration's cavalier endorsement of shipping American jobs \noverseas can only make\n\n[[Page S959]]\n\nmatters worse. The administration owes the American people an \nexplanation and an apology. More than that, they owe this Nation a plan \nthat will actually create jobs, not export them to China, to India, or \nother low-wage countries but to create jobs here.\n  I ask the President to renounce this report from his economic \nadvisers and assure all Americans that the Federal Government will not \nbe taking steps to export these jobs overseas.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my leader time not be \ntaken from the morning business allocated to the Democratic side.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I commend the leader for his statement this morning and \nask him the following: If the Bush administration is now telling us \nthat tax cuts for the wealthy are good for America, if they are now \ntelling us that outsourcing jobs from the United States to other \ncountries is good for America, and they are now cutting overtime pay \nfor American workers and refusing to give unemployed workers in our \ncountry the benefits they need to keep their families together, I would \nlike to ask the Senator from South Dakota and our leader on the \nDemocratic side if he believes this is the right economic policy to \nmove America forward out of this recession and into prosperity?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I would simply say that if you judge how \ngood an economy is by the number of jobs created, this policy has been \na failure. If you judge economic policy by the kind of fiscal position \nwe now hold--we have a $600 billion deficit and a $3.5 trillion debt; a \n$9 trillion swing as a result of the tax cuts--this policy is a \nfailure. If you judge by how one pays and rewards work rather than \nwealth, by this administration's position on overtime, this position \nand policy is a failure.\n  I think as we debate the economic circumstances we face in this \ncountry these failures ought to be front and center because they are \nthe focus of every American family today.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Will the leader yield for a question as well?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, on behalf of the men and women of \nMichigan I thank the Democratic leader for his comments this morning. \nWe read headlines every single day of jobs being lost to other \ncountries, outsourcing, plants that are leaving. It is clear to me we \nhave an administration more focused on wealth than valuing work, as the \ndistinguished Senator from Illinois indicated, with a whole series of \npolicies that do not reward work.\n  I wonder if the leader might comment on the fact this is a race to \nthe bottom. What they are saying to Americans is they should work for \n$2.50 an hour or $1 an hour or instead of being a computer programmer \nhere, earning $50,000 a year, if you earn $15,000 a year, maybe we \nwon't outsource your job. Isn't this a way to eliminate the middle \nclass? How do they, in fact, purchase the cars and the refrigerators \nand computers and have the quality of life they want, send their \nchildren to college, be able to afford a quality of life as Americans, \nif this is a race to the bottom?\n  Would the leader agree this is now a race to the bottom and a threat \nto the middle class and their way of life?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I respond to the Senator from Michigan by \nsaying she has characterized this situation very accurately. It is a \nrace to the bottom.\n  I had a conversation not long ago with a worker at a grocery store \nchain who was commenting that they are currently in negotiations with \nthis particular chain. He noted over the last 30 years, as negotiations \nhave been evolving, at every juncture, all through the 30 years, the \nquestion was: How can we make improvements; how can we improve wages; \nhow can we improve benefits; how can we continue to stay abreast of the \ncurrent fiscal and financial challenges every family faces? That was \nthe goal, to advance the benefits, the wages, to take into account the \ndramatic changes in their own circumstances.\n  He said for the first time in 30 years, their only goal this time is \nto hold on to what they have so the company doesn't take away benefits, \nthe company doesn't take away wages.\n  He said: Those on the other side are arguing, we are going to take \naway some of your wages and some of your benefits because that is what \nis happening with the competition. In order to be competitive, we have \nto reduce your wages and reduce your benefits.\n  I will not accept that for this country. We can't possibly accept the \nfact we have to move backward. If we are a progressive society, we have \nto recognize these families have to continue to move forward with \nregard to their benefits and wages or, you are absolutely right, we \nwill have a race to the bottom, a disparity between those at the top, \nwho get the tax cuts the Senator from Illinois referenced, and those at \nthe bottom, who get not only no tax cuts but now are losing their jobs, \nbenefits and wages, and their overtime. What is that going to do to \nthis country? We are going to have the biggest chasm in all of our \nhistory soon between those at the top and those at the bottom. That is \nunacceptable.\n  I thank the Senator for her question.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Would the Chair announce how much time is left for morning \nbusiness on this side?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Twenty-four minutes 37 seconds.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the distinguished majority leader announced \ntoday the tax cuts were working. My question to him and everyone within \nthe sound of my voice would be: Working for whom? As has been \nindicated, we have staggering deficits. We have a staggering debt that \nwas not there when this man took the office of President a little more \nthan 3 years ago.\n  I have been reading a book the last couple days, ``The Price of \nLoyalty,'' by Ron Suskind and Paul O'Neill. In that book, quite \nclearly, Paul O'Neill was extremely concerned about the deficits and \nbrought it up at a Cabinet meeting. He was cut off very quickly by Vice \nPresident Cheney, saying: President Reagan proved that tax cuts are \ngood and that deficits don't matter.\n  I believe deficits do matter. I believe we have a situation \ndeveloping that is going to cause untold misery and harm, as indicated \nby the budget we have been given today. We will talk about that during \nthe next few weeks as the budget negotiations and debate go forward.\n  I am happy to yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank the assistant majority leader for \nyielding me 10 minutes in morning business. I rise to follow up on what \nthe Democratic leader was talking about in\n\n[[Page S960]]\n\nterms of the statement of the chairman of the President's economic \nadvisers saying: Outsourcing of jobs in this country is a good thing.\n  I read the followup comments by White House spokeswoman Claire \nBuchan, who said: The President's view is that American workers are the \nbest workers in the world and he is committed to free and fair trade. \nHe is committed to a level playing field.\n  That all sounds very nice, but is it level when you have a worker in \nChina making 61 cents an hour and a worker in America making $12 or \n$13, $14 an hour? What kind of a level playing field is that? As the \nleader said, this is a race to the bottom.\n  You can always find someone someplace who is lower down on the totem \npole, who is more hungry, more destitute, willing to work for less than \nyou. If that is what we are looking for, we might as well go back to \nslavery.\n  If you want to talk about efficiency, that is what they are saying: \nWhen a good or service is produced more cheaply abroad, it makes more \nsense to import it than to provide it domestically. That has to do with \nefficiency, they said.\n  Efficiency? Is that what we as human beings are now looked upon, as a \nmachine, how efficient a machine we are or is there more to life than \nthat.\n  When I hear words like that, I say people have some sterile view of \neconomics that counts people as just so many cogs in a wheel or so many \nunits we can depreciate, use up and throw out on the trash heap after a \nwhile. It disturbs me greatly, the positions of these people in making \nsuch statements.\n\n  I recognize free trade or fair trade is good for everyone as long as \nit does not lower people's standard of living but tends to raise people \nup to ours. That is what we ought to be involved in--not lowering our \nstandard of living to others but trying to help them raise theirs.\n  Couple that with this dance of the administration that outsourcing \njobs, shipping jobs overseas is good, somehow good for our country, \nwith the budget we have now in front of us and what it spells is a \ndisaster for this country and especially for our young people.\n  We have had the first recovery from a recession in modern time. There \nare still about 3 million jobs lost out there. This budget continues on \nthat way. We have tax cuts for the wealthy. It does not create jobs. We \nhave this proposal to eliminate overtime pay Senator Durbin brought up. \nNow we are going to create jobs in India and China and places such as \nthat by outsourcing all of our jobs.\n  Then you look at the budget, and the budget we have will continue \ndeficits as far as the eye can see. It will increase deficits. What \nthat means is we are now going to be paying a debt tax. As this \nadministration increases the national debt, they increase the share of \nthe Federal budget that goes to pay the interest on the debt. So every \ndollar we spend on interest is a dollar we are not spending on \neducation or construction or health care, rebuilding our economy. This \nis the hidden tax in Mr. Bush's budget. He says he wants tax cuts, \nmostly for the wealthy. He wants to make them permanent. That will cost \nus another $1 trillion. But what about the hidden tax, the debt tax \nthat is going to be put upon our workers and our children to pay the \nhuge interest charges on this national debt that is running up?\n  Right now interest payments are about $4,367 a year for a family of \nfour.\n  By 2010, because of these huge budget deficits, this debt tax rises \nto more than $8,000 for a family of four. That is just the interest \nevery year. That means every family of four in America will be paying \nabout $8,000 a year in additional taxes just to pay the interest on the \nnational debt. Again, this is a formula for utter disaster.\n  The baby boomers are on the verge of retirement--1946 being the first \nyear of the baby boomers. They will retire basically at 65, so that \nbrings us to the year 2011. When they start retiring, we will be in the \nhole with huge budget deficits. President Clinton set us on the right \ntrack to reach 2010 with zero national debt, in great fiscal shape to \nbegin to finance the baby boomers' retirement and their health care. \nThat inheritance from President Clinton, being on the right track and \nerasing the total national debt, has been squandered--squandered by tax \ncuts for the wealthy, squandered by the outsourcing of jobs to other \ncountries, and destroying jobs in America. So we are going to reach \n2010 with a crushing debt burden, higher interest rates, a weaker \neconomy, and the baby boomers just retiring.\n  We know we are mortgaging our future, stealing from the next \ngeneration. Why? So that the wealthiest can have a tax cut of $155,000 \na year. This is not wise and it is not fair. The consequences are going \nto hit us right now, not just in the year 2001. Just look at the \nbudget. It shortchanges No Child Left Behind by $7 billion. The budget \ncuts funding for local police by $1.7 billion. It cuts funding for \nfirefighters by $800 million.\n  There you have the essence of the Bush economic plan: huge tax cuts \nfor the rich, skyrocketing deficits and debt, cuts in programs that \nserve children and working Americans, and outsourcing of our jobs to \nother countries, thus reducing the overall income of middle-class \nAmericans.\n  It is time for the Senate to come together and demand a change of \ncourse, demand fiscal sanity, fiscal integrity, and a change in our \neconomic program. I believe this is the single biggest test we face in \nthe year ahead. Quite frankly, I believe President Bush is out of \ncontrol in demanding even more tax cuts. The House of Representatives \nbasically will do whatever the White House says. So I say to my \ncolleagues it is up to us.\n  Quite frankly, if the Senate doesn't step in and provide some adult \nsupervision in Washington, then nobody will, and we will, in fact, \nmarch down this path of huge deficits, bigger and bigger deficits, \nhigher debt, more interest payments on the debt, and the increasing \noutsourcing of our jobs to other countries. It is time to stop this \ndownward spiral. I believe only we in the Senate can do it.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nIllinois, Mr. Durbin.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/11/senate-section/article/S960-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S960-S962]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         PROTECTING THE TROOPS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, last night a group of Senators went out \nfor dinner at Walter Reed Hospital with the soldiers who have returned \nfrom Iraq and Afghanistan, many of whom are undergoing important \nmedical treatment and rebuilding their lives and strength to return to \ntheir families, and some to return to service to our country. These are \nour best. These men and women with whom we had the good fortune to eat \ndinner last night are really some of the finest people you could ever \nmeet. They have given more to this country than any of us will ever \ngive, and they have done it with a sense of loyalty and a sense of \npatriotism that all of us admire.\n  As I talked to these soldiers and asked them about their experience, \nI asked them about their injuries: What happened when you were in Iraq?\n  The story that comes back more often than not is that these \nsoldiers--many of them--were in Humvee vehicles, which is our modern \njeep, traveling in Baghdad and other cities and localities in Iraq, \nwhen their vehicle was struck by a rocket-propelled grenade or a \nhomemade bomb that was detonated. Many of them were seriously injured. \nOne brave soldier from South Dakota lost his right arm. The Army \ncaptain in the next Humvee was killed, and he believes he was lucky to \nescape alive. I asked him what Congress could do to help.\n  He said: We are getting good medical treatment, and our families are \nbeing treated fine. But can you do something about those Humvees? The \nHumvee doesn't have armor plating on the sides, armored doors to \nprotect us and other soldiers.\n  You think to yourself, of the billions of dollars we have spent in \nIraq, we don't have armored doors on the Humvees so that these soldiers \ncan come home safely?\n  I asked the Secretary of the Army: What is this problem? He came back \nto me and reported that there are 8,400 Humvees in Iraq that don't have \narmored doors. The soldiers, last night, said they would improvise. \nThey would get sheets of steel and cut them and place them on the sides \nof the Humvees\n\n[[Page S961]]\n\nso they are not vulnerable in these areas.\n  We should do better. I said to the Secretary of the Army: Isn't this \na priority? He said: It is our highest priority to build the 8,400 \ndoors for these Humvees. He told me that many will be made in my State \nat the Rock Island Arsenal. I visited the Rock Island Arsenal and saw \nthe first sets of doors come off for the Humvees, and the workers were \nso proud. They knew they had done something significant.\n  I said to the commander at the arsenal: How long will it take us now? \nWe need 8,400 sets and we are also doing them at Anniston. He said: We \nare going to get these doors built in one year.\n  One year? In World War II, we were building bombers in 72 hours and \nships in 30 and 60 days, and we need 1 year to make the armor-plated \ndoors to protect the Humvees so that fewer of our men and women in \nuniform will have to go to Walter Reed Hospital for prosthetic devices \nand medical treatment.\n  I said: Why is it taking one year? He said: Because there is only one \nsteel-fabricating plant left in America, and it is in Pennsylvania. It \nmakes the steel that we can convert into the armor plating for these \ndoors. We are using everything they produce as fast as they produce it.\n\n  So when the issue comes up about loss of manufacturing jobs, and loss \nof American jobs, and loss of our industrial base, it is more than a \ncold discussion of statistics; it is a discussion about the reality of \nour economy and the reality we face. Whether you live in North \nCarolina, where we have lost textile jobs, or you live in Illinois, \nwhere we have lost steel jobs, the fact is, as we lose these jobs, we \nlose our capacity. When it comes to something as basic as steel, that \ncapacity plays out so that our soldiers in Iraq today are more \nvulnerable to enemy attack because we cannot produce the steel in \nAmerica.\n  So we asked the administration: What should we do about all these \njobs going overseas? What should we do about the loss of the industrial \nbase? Is this a challenge we need to face and deal with?\n  Our answer came back this week in a report from the White House. This \nis a headline from the Los Angeles Times of yesterday: ``Bush Supports \nShift of Jobs Overseas.''\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       The loss of work to other countries, while painful in the \n     short term, will enrich the economy eventually, his report to \n     Congress says.\n\n  Like many colleagues, I read this headline and I said: It cannot be \ntrue; clearly, this is a mistake. I cannot believe the Bush \nadministration would say that shifting jobs overseas is good for \nAmerica.\n  Then we looked at other newspapers around the country, not just the \nL.A. Times. In the Seattle Times, the same report was analyzed. Their \nheadline reads: ``Bush report: Sending Jobs Overseas Helps U.S.'' The \nPittsburgh Post-Gazette: ``Bush Economic Report Praises `Outsourcing' \nJobs.'' The Orlando Sentinel: ``Bush Says Sending Jobs Abroad Can Be \nBeneficial.''\n  Yes, as we read the report, that is exactly what was said.\n  Mr. N. Gregory Mankiw, chairman of President Bush's Council of \nEconomic Advisers, said:\n\n       Outsourcing is just a new way of doing international trade. \n     More things are tradable than were tradable in the past. And \n     that's a good thing.\n\n  Is that a good thing, President Bush and Mr. Mankiw? Would you like \nto go to Walter Reed Hospital and explain to the soldiers who have been \nvictimized by the loss of steel production in America that this is a \ngood thing? It is not a good thing.\n  I am one who supports trade. I believe globalization is as inevitable \nas gravity, but I also understand we need economic leadership from the \ntop, from the White House and the President on down that says we will \nenforce trade agreements; we will build America's economic base; we \nwill not surrender American jobs willingly.\n  This report from the Bush administration says that they not only \nsurrender these jobs willingly, they do it with applause. What a good \nthing it must be that the President's report says to Congress that we \nhave lost so many jobs overseas--jobs to China, jobs to India, and it \ncontinues.\n  In technology, there was a time when we were king; Silicon Valley \nruled, and they should--all the ingenuity and creativity that came up \nwith these dramatic advances in technology. What is happening today? A \nlarge and growing number of computer-related jobs are already leaving \nAmerica.\n  IBM, for example, announced in December it is going to transfer 4,730 \nprogramming jobs from the United States to India, China, and other \ncountries. Insurance giant Aetna likewise decided early in the year to \nbegin sending 20 percent of its application outsourcing work to India.\n  From the viewpoint of President Bush and his economic advisers, this \nis great news: IBM is sending jobs to India and China; Aetna is going \nto outsource 20 percent of its jobs to India. From their point of view, \nfrom the statement they sent to Congress, we should applaud this: what \na great development, that all of the programmers and electrical \nengineers who work for these companies will now be out of work and \nsomeone overseas will take their jobs for a fraction of the pay they \nwere receiving.\n  That is not good news in my home. It is not good news in Illinois. \nAnd I don't think it is good news for most working families across \nAmerica.\n  The President yesterday appeared in a plant in Missouri and said: Our \ntax cuts for the wealthy are working; they really turned this economy \naround. I am sorry to say to the President that he has the dubious \ndistinction at this point in his Presidency of having lost more jobs as \na President of the United States than any President since Herbert \nHoover in the Great Depression.\n  This President has watched these jobs leave, and for a time you would \nthink it troubled him and for a time you would think he was trying to \nbring these jobs back to the United States or protect the jobs we have. \nBut the report to Congress this week says it is part of a designed \nplan--a plan by the Bush administration that happens to believe in \ntheir wrongheaded way that tax cuts for the wealthiest people in \nAmerica are good for our future; that happens to believe outsourcing \njobs to India and China somehow is positive for America; and that \nhappens to believe Americans who are out of work don't deserve \nunemployment benefits and those who are working shouldn't be paid for \novertime.\n  That is the economic policy of the Bush administration, and that is \nwhy we have elections in America. American families who have seen these \njobs go overseas are going to reject this wrongheaded Bush economic \npolicy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I think we are going to find soon the \nAmerican people will respond in resounding terms to this report to \nCongress.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes seventeen seconds.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, before my friend from Illinois leaves the \nfloor, I would like to propound a question to him. I say to my friend \nfrom Illinois, the majority leader was on the floor today, and I think \nthe Senator from Illinois heard me remark earlier that he said the tax \ncuts are working. I have thought about that since I spoke 20 minutes \nago, and I think he is probably right, they are working for the elite \nof this country, people who are in the upper income brackets.\n  Does the Senator from Illinois know of anyone else who is receiving a \nbenefit from the tax cuts?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I say to the Senator from Nevada, yes, I \nwill tell the Senator who will benefit from the tax cut: the countries \nthat are loaning money to America to finance the debt that these tax \ncuts have created. Specifically Japan, which is loaning over $500 \nbillion to the United States to pay for our debt, and China. China, in \nloaning money to the United States, is earning interest. So the \nJapanese and the Chinese benefit from the President's tax cuts and \neconomic policy because they are earning interest on this massive debt, \na deficit larger than any President has ever created in the history of \nthe United States of America. The winners, as I see it, would be the \noverseas investors, as well as the wealthiest people in our country. \nThey are the winners.\n\n[[Page S962]]\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, has my friend reviewed the text of the \nbook, ``The Price of Loyalty''?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I read this book.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator does recall in that book where Vice President \nCheney, when Paul O'Neill said we should take a look at these deficits \nthat are building up, and does the Senator recall--this is almost a \ndirect quote--Vice President Cheney interrupting the meeting and \nsaying: President Reagan proved deficits don't matter?\n  Can the Senator from Illinois comment on that statement, ``deficits \ndon't matter''?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I remember it. In addition to some other comments in the \nbook, it was the most graphic illustration that this administration is \ninsensitive to the deficits and debt they are creating.\n  I also recall in that same book Paul O'Neill, then-Secretary of the \nTreasury, was recommending to the Bush administration to put triggers \nin the tax cuts so that if the surplus disappeared, then the tax cuts \nwould not continue and drag us even deeper into debt. That was rejected \nby Larry Lindsey, the former head of the Council of Economic Advisers, \nthe predecessor to the man who came up with this delightful equation \nthat says losing jobs overseas is good for America.\n  What we have had is a wonderful parade of economic extremists in the \nWhite House who advised this administration into the current mess with \nour budget and with our economy.\n  Mr. REID. Is that the same Larry Lindsey who was fired because he \nsaid the war in Iraq would cost more than $100 billion?\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is right, he misspoke and, as a result, he was \nreturned to the private sector. Now we see his predecessor, Mr. Mankiw, \nwho now has misspoken, but we have his report. President Bush sent his \nreport to Congress and he said outsourcing American jobs is good for \nAmerica. I am sure we are going to hear a correction before the Sun \ngoes down in Washington today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I wish to talk about the economy. We can \nsure tell this is an election year. The false rhetoric that is going on \nabout the economy is amazing. The fact is, the economy is recovering \nand our tax cuts have made a significant difference in the fact our \neconomy is recovering.\n  I heard the previous speaker on the floor talk about the jobs we are \nlosing, but this President and this Republican Congress inherited an \neconomy that was going in the dumps when he went into office.\n  It was headed downhill. The stock market had been down for 9 months \nand the recession was just beginning when he was taking his oath of \noffice, so one cannot blame this President for what has happened in the \neconomy. We need to look back at what happened during the Clinton \nadministration. We had one of the highest tax increases in the history \nof this country. Everybody who follows the economy knows it takes a \nwhile for tax policy to take effect. What has happened under the Bush \nPresidency, with a Republican Congress, is we put some tax cuts in \nplace to get the economy recovered. It has worked. Now it did not start \nworking immediately, but after a year or two we began to see the \nresults. We are seeing the results today.\n  The Members of the Senate who come to this floor and say we ought to \nraise taxes, that will do nothing more than destroy the economic \nrecovery process we see taking place right now.\n  I have a report from the Joint Economic Committee. The chairman of \nthat committee happens to be Senator Bennett. It is made up equally of \nMembers of each party from the Senate. There are five Republicans and \nfive Democrats on the Joint Economic Committee. They have published a \nrather promising report. It is time we take a look at what they say \nabout the economy. There should not be any doubt that the economy is \nrecovering and a lot of it has been done due to the tax cuts. We should \nnot allow a tax increase to occur that would destroy this economic \ngrowth.\n  They report the economy is strong and there is sustainable growth \ngoing on. The recovery continues at a strong pace. Payrolls increased \nby over 112,000 jobs in January as activity in the manufacturing and \nservices industries accelerated. Last year closed with the economy \ngrowing at a 4 percent annual rate and productivity growing at a 2.7 \npercent annual rate, well above the long-run averages. Despite all of \nthis, inflation remains benign. It is not growing, allowing the Federal \nReserve to maintain short-term interest rates at historical lows. \nRecent tax relief continues to benefit consumers and businesses. \nForecasters see continued robust growth, low inflation, and accelerated \njob gains throughout this year. That is pretty good news.\n  The payroll employment increase of 112,000 jobs in January was the \nlargest monthly gain since the year 2000. The unemployment rate fell to \n5.6 percent. I remember when I took economics in college in the 1960s. \nFive percent was considered full employment. We were spoiled a little \nbit and it was definitely an aberration, as a lot of economists \ndescribed it, when we got down to 4 percent, but 5 percent is still \nconsidered a full employment figure. The unemployment rate fell to 5.6 \npercent in January, well below its recent peak of 6.3 percent last \nJune. Five straight months of job gains have now added 366,000 jobs to \nU.S. payrolls.\n  5.6 percent is good news. The economy grew at a robust 4 percent \nannual rate in the fourth quarter of 2003. Forecasters see continued \ngrowth of around 4 percent throughout this year. Productivity--this is \noutput per hour of labor--grew at a 2.7 percent pace in the fourth \nquarter, above historical averages. I continue to believe the workers \nin this country are the best educated, the best motivated, and nowhere \nin the world is their productivity exceeded. They are the ultimate. I \nthink we should be proud of that and recognize it is all that \nindividual effort that makes a difference and what keeps this economic \nengine growing.\n  The Federal Reserve has kept short-term interest rates unchanged at 1 \npercent, which is good for individuals who want to buy homes, for \nexample. The administration worked with me to pass legislation called \nthe American Dream Down Payment Act to get people into homes. I see now \nthey are reporting that home ownership is at an historic high. It has \nnever been higher in the history of this country than what we are \nseeing today as far as homeownership. That legislation, working with \nthe administration, is the type of effort that is making the \ndifference.\n  The household survey, used to calculate the unemployment rate, showed \nemployment gains of almost 500,000 in January. The gap between the \nhousehold and the payroll measures of employment continues to widen, \nconfirming initial labor market improvements and continuing jobless \nclaims for unemployment insurance benefits are trending downward.\n\n  I like to rely on the household survey because I think the household \nsurvey tells us something the payroll survey does not. What it tells me \nis a lot of our Americans are saying, look, now is the time for me to \nstart my own business. When they start their own business they start \nout small so that means\n\n[[Page S963]]\n\nthey start out of their home, they contract to do their labor. Then as \ndemand grows for their service they begin to expand out from there. The \nhousehold survey reflects that.\n  We have seen tremendous growth in the household survey. The payroll \nwage survey misses that particular parameter. That has been good news \nfor some time, and the Joint Economic Committee has shown evidence this \ncontinues to grow. This is the small business sector of this country. \nIt is the small business sector where one sees economic growth happen \nbecause this is where new ideas develop. This is where small companies \nhave an opportunity to grow into larger companies like we have seen \nmany of our high-tech companies do.\n  Last night I had dinner with a number of executives from high-tech \ncompanies, and they are bullish on our economy. They think things are \ndoing pretty well. They told us, well, maybe there have been a few jobs \nthat have gone overseas, but nearly all of our jobs are growing in \nAmerica. This is where our job growth is happening.\n  Again, this is a political year and a lot of this false negative \nrhetoric is not telling the full story, and that is what I want to get \nacross this morning. The economy is recovering and that is due to our \ntax cuts. Gross domestic product and productivity have grown at a very \nstrong and sustainable rate. Real gross domestic product, often \nreferred to as the GDP, grew at a solid 4 percent annual rate in the \nfourth quarter, following the third quarter's remarkable 8.2 percent \nrate. Amazing, the third quarter of last year had a 8.2 percent growth \nrate.\n  In the second half of 2003, the economy grew at the fastest 6-month \npace in almost 20 years. Over 2003, as a whole, gross domestic product \ngrew at a robust average of 4.3 percent. By way of comparison, the \neconomy grew at an average of 3.7 percent during the expansion of the \n1990s. Even when we had unprecedented economic growth in the 1990s, it \nwas only 3.7 percent. We saw a much higher growth rate last year. \nProductivity also advanced, growing at a 2.7 percent annual rate in the \nfourth quarter, and in excess of 4 percent for the second consecutive \nyear, well above historical averages.\n  Forecasters believe the gross domestic growth will be sustained at \naround 4 percent throughout this year. That is all good news. Our tax \ncuts are working.\n  Let's look at business activity. Business activity continues to \nstrengthen. Increases in average weekly hours of work and moderation of \njob losses in manufacturing indicate rising activity. Confirming this \ntrend, the Institute for Supply Management manufacturing index has \nrisen since May to its highest value since 1983. The ISM services index \nhas also been rising and, in January, was the highest in its history. \nIndex value over 50 means the relevant sector is expanding. Current \nvalues of well above 60 indicate vigorous expansion in manufacturing \nand service.\n\n  The economy is recovering and our cutting taxes is making the \ndifference. Consumer confidence and spending grew. The University of \nMichigan's consumer sentiment index rose in January to its highest \nvalue since 2000. The Confidence Board's index rose to the highest in \n18 months.\n  After tax income also continues to grow, boosted by tax cuts. Most \nAmericans, after filing their taxes, are going to get more money back \nfrom the Government than they have in previous years. Improved \nsentiment and incomes have boosted consumer spending, which grew at a \n2.6-percent annual pace in the fourth quarter after hearty spending in \nthe third quarter. After tax incomes will improve further as taxpayers \nreceive higher refunds.\n  What does it look like as far as the Fed? They are holding monetary \npolicy steady. It is unchanged. This means they kept short-term \ninterest rates at the five-decade low of 1 percent but changed their \npolicy statement to set up flexibility to raise rates if they see signs \nof inflation. So they are prepared to act if we start to move into an \ninflationary cycle. Many measures of inflation are at their lowest \nsince the 1960s, a key reason the Fed has accommodated strong growth \nwithout raising rates.\n  I continue to point to the housing market where we had huge amounts \nof growth in home ownership because interest rates are low. All of a \nsudden, individuals who could not make a downpayment on a home found \nthat, by gosh, with the interest rates down, it is easier for them to \ncome up with the payment. It means their monthly payment will be less \nbecause interest rates are lower. Home ownership is good for the \neconomy. It creates jobs.\n  The housing market remains robust. Remarkably strong home sales have \nboosted the home ownership rate to a new high, and that new high is \n68.5 percent. Many signs point to more strength in housing in the near \nterm. Mortgage applications have increased again on a renewed dip in \nmortgage rates.\n  Housing starts rose in December to the highest rate in about 20 years \nand permits for home construction were up for the fourth quarter. This \nis all good news. The economy is recovering. It has been due to those \ntax cuts that we implemented earlier in the President's term.\n  Ministers from major industrial countries met last weekend to discuss \ncurrency issues, including the dollar's recent decline and China's \ndollar peg. The dollar fell 10 percent against Japan's yen and 17 \npercent against the euro last year, making U.S. exports less costly in \nworld markets and imports more costly. Ministers again called for \nflexible, ``orderly'' exchange rates.\n  This is all good news. I recall at the first of last year and in 2002 \nmanufacturers were coming to me and complaining about their inability \nto compete in the international markets because the value of the dollar \nwas so much higher than what it had been historically. Those of you who \nare listening understand, when the value of the dollar is low, it means \nthe cost of your goods and services are much higher and it is harder \nfor you to be competitive against the yen or euro, for example. Now \nthat is changing. The value of the dollar has dropped down so this \nmeans our manufactured goods are going to be able to compete overseas \nagainst those products that are already provided.\n  I feel good about what we can look forward to. I am disappointed that \nwe have to resort to all this negative rhetoric because we are in a \ncampaign. I have shared with my colleagues here, and the American \npeople, some real facts about what is happening in the economy. I don't \nthink anybody, when they look at these facts, can disagree that our \neconomy is in a state of recovery. Obviously, you can take the facts \nand pull them over two decades and you can distort them and try to make \nthe President look bad as far as the economy is concerned.\n  But the fact is, President Bush has had a strong growth policy for \nthe economy, and it is working. It included cutting taxes and holding \nthe growth in interest rates down, working with the Fed. Economic \nindicators have shown positive growth and the economy is going to \ncontinue to do that.\n  I cannot understand why the opposition party has decided they are \ngoing to make the economy their issue. It is a losing issue because the \neconomy is recovering. The American people are beginning to realize \nthat. My State, for example, is a diverse State. We don't like to put \nall our eggs in one basket, so we have manufacturing, we have tourism, \nin the State of Colorado we have agriculture, we have natural \nresources, high technology, telecommunications and research and \ndevelopment. We realize things need to be done to encourage that, \nsomething we need to encourage throughout the country, to make sure we \nstay competitive. And that is educations. The company executives I met \nwith last night said, yes, education is important. We need to be sure \nthat we have our workforce, our citizens, well educated.\n  The President has pushed to improve education. No Child Left Behind \nis certainly a sincere effort to try to improve our educational system. \nI happen to think it is going to work.\n  We are improving our educational system. The economic figures are \nlooking good. We should all be positive about the outlook, as far as \nAmerica is concerned.\n  I am proud to be American. I am proud of my small business roots. I \nhad an opportunity to start a business from scratch as a veterinarian \nand I worked hard to see that grow. It gave me an opportunity to \ncontribute to my community as a small businessman, and to\n\n[[Page S964]]\n\nprovide an opportunity for my children to get an education. They got \ntheir education. Now they are raising their families. I want to see my \ngrandchildren have the same future that I have enjoyed, and my children \nhave enjoyed.\n  I think what the President is doing to hold down taxes creates lots \nof opportunity for young people to get their own business started. That \nis the strength of America, our small business sector. That is where \ninnovation starts and that is where growth begins.\n  Madam President, I am curious to know how much time we have left on \nthis side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 11 minutes 56 seconds.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I want to talk a little bit more about the housing issue. \nAs our economy was going through an unprecedented decline, we saw \nhousing stay up. That was the one part of our economy that actually \nsustained us.\n  It was a pleasure for me to be able to work with the President on the \nAmerican Dream Downpayment Act, to allow for young people in all areas \nof the country to begin to be able to make that downpayment on that \nfirst home.\n  In studying what was happening in the last several years, even though \nwe had dropped interest rates and it was easier to qualify for loans, \nthere were a lot of people who should have but did not own their own \nhomes. Historically the barrier was that downpayment. So the American \nDream Downpayment Act provides a way for families who run up to this \nbarrier, where they look at their rental rates they are paying that are \nexactly the same as what their mortgage payment would be, this provides \nthem an opportunity to get past this downpayment barrier in order to \nown a home.\n  It is working. It is going to work. As it moves forward--it is just \ngetting started--it is going to do even more to create home ownership.\n  I am proud of this President. I am proud of his economic policies. I \nam proud to be able to work with him in a partnership in cutting taxes \nand encouraging the economy to grow.\n  As a small businessman, I know how that works. If anything affects a \njob, or growth, it is when taxes get too high and rules and regulations \ntake over your business. As a small businessman, I have had to suffer \nthrough down economies. I have had to lay people off because our small \nbusiness was not doing very well because of a down economy. It is not \nfun.\n  But we always recovered and after we recovered we were more \nproductive and we were more efficient and we generally provided a \nbetter service. I think that has happened in this country. I think a \nlot of companies have taken the downturn and streamlined their \noperations, improved their services.\n  The bottom line is that we are going to have more jobs in this \ncountry. Our economy is going to continue to grow. The bottom line is \nthe consumers in this country are going to be better served.\n  This President has done the right thing for America. It is \nunfortunate that, in an election year such as this, the political \nrhetoric gets so negative because it really does not reflect what has \nbeen going on. To repeat, unemployment rates have dropped to 5.6 \npercent. The gross domestic product is growing at phenomenal rates. Job \ngrowth is happening. It is occurring today.\n  Other countries have looked at what we have done in America to create \njobs, and they are updating.\n  Competition is going to be tough in the international market, and we \nneed to be prepared to compete. Trade restrictions is not the way to do \nit. We historically have been able to compete throughout the \ninternational community without trade restrictions. In fact, the trade \nagreements we pass actually make it possible for the United States to \ncut down the trade tariffs that are applied against American products.\n  One of the things that gets thrown out here is the trade deficit. The \ntrade deficit has been the worst in this country during the Depression \nand during the recession we had at the end of the Carter years in the \n1970s. When our economy goes down, trade deficits get better. When our \neconomy goes up, trade deficits change because consumers are buying \nmore goods. When you have them buying more goods, it creates more jobs. \nI don't see where the trade issue is one that really reflects what is \nhappening in the economy.\n  I shared these issues with you this morning because that is really \nwhat is happening in the economy. Employment is rising, unemployment \nrates continue to fall, gross domestic product and productivity \ncontinue to grow strong and at a sustainable rate, business activity \ncontinues to strengthen, consumer confidence and spending grows, the \nFed is holding interests rates at a steady 1 percent, and the housing \nmarket looks really good. It has been good for a while and continues to \nlook good. When you compare the dollar to the yen or to the euro, its \nvalue is going down, which is good for exports. It is good for \nbusiness. It means we will be able to move our products overseas. I \nthink it looks good.\n  I am proud of this President. He has the right solution, and it is \nworking.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/11/senate-section/article/S964-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S964]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Madam President, I commend the Senator from Colorado, Mr. \nAllard, for his remarks on the economy. I want to get into the pending \namendment. At that point, I hope the managers will allow me to continue \nand talk about this seatbelt amendment.\n  I commend my colleague from Colorado, Senator Allard, for his \ncomments. Tax cuts are working because individuals, families, and small \nbusinesses have greater freedom. They are investing. More jobs are \nbeing created, and there is more economic activity which makes our \ncountry more competitive.\n  Our tax laws and regulatory policies--and any policy we have in this \ncountry--needs to ensure that there is more investment and more jobs in \nAmerica. We ought not ruin opportunities for businesses to provide \ntheir employees with broad-based stock options. The People's Republic \nof China has technology companies that promote themselves because they \nhave stock options for their employees. I hope in America we would not \ndeny that opportunity. Internet taxes matter. We need not be imposing \nhigher taxes on access to the Internet, particularly broadband. Energy \nis important. We need to have energy sufficiency and reliance, domestic \nproduction of natural gas or clean coal or oil, as well as advancements \nin new technology. And this highway bill is a part of that, it is also \nfor infrastructure, jobs, and the movement of people to and from work \nwith less congestion. I hope we will get to it.\n  In the midst of this, we have an amendment. I have a tremendous \namount of admiration and respect for my colleague, the senior Senator \nfrom Virginia, Mr. Warner. His service to Virginia and to our Nation \nmakes him a true American hero, in my view, and a great patriot. It is \nan honor to serve and partner with him.\n  However, I am compelled to voice my opposition to an amendment that \nSenator Hillary Clinton and he have proposed to the underlying highway \nbill. The amendment that is before us, while certainly well-\nintentioned, should not, in my view, be the purview of this body or the \nFederal Government. The proponents argue that it is a good idea to wear \nseatbelts. In most cases, that is\n\n[[Page S965]]\n\ntrue. But there is really no assertion nor persuasive reason that has \nbeen proffered for Federal jurisdiction in this case. This certainly is \nnot interstate commerce. Without a Federal interest, I think this cause \nor this claim or this idea ought to be dismissed in the Senate and \nremanded to the place where this ought to be adjudicated; that is, in \nthe State legislatures because this is clearly a State interest.\n  Beyond the lack of Federal jurisdiction, I have long detested \nnannyism that emanates from the Federal Government. I believe \nlegislating common sense is an ill-fated course that will result in \ncountless mandates and directives imposed upon the American people.\n  No one in this body or around the country will argue that wearing a \nseatbelt is not a good idea. I wear them. I make sure my kids are \nbuckled up. Of course, there are laws that have to do with children, \nbut we are dealing with adults with this amendment.\n  The point is whether or not the Federal Government or any government \nought to be legislating or coercing sensible behavior. There will be \nall sorts of ideas where people will say: Gosh, it is in government's \ninterest--not just seatbelts but, gosh, you should not be drinking hot \ncoffee, you should not be talking on the cell phone, and you should not \nbe changing the radio station or trying to find your Alan Jackson CD \nwhile driving. You should not be eating a hamburger while driving. You \nought not be looking at your Blackberry and replying while driving.\n  If there are going to be laws in this area--which I do not advocate--\nit ought to be at the State level.\n  Any of these examples I cited, obviously, endanger not only the \ndriver but others.\n  I thank my colleague from Missouri, Senator Bond, for his great \nleadership on the highway bill, and also his support for the principles \nI will continue to espouse to my colleagues on this mandatory seatbelt \ndictate amendment.\n  I don't think this body wishes to dictate mandates on a lot of things \nbecause they make good sense. Let's look at law enforcement. I am sure \nthere are some in law enforcement officers who like this idea of \nprimary enforcement rather than secondary enforcement. In my view, law \nenforcement has a lot of important things to do, especially on safety \nof the highways.\n  For example, there is a driver on the road without his or her \nseatbelt on but otherwise driving the speed limit in their lane safely, \nnot impaired by drugs or alcohol; meanwhile, law enforcement stops \nthem, pulls them over, and it takes 20 to 30 minutes for them to cite \nsomeone who undoubtedly will be miffed by such pestering. At the same \ntime, down the same stretch of highway there could be a drug-impaired \nor alcohol-impaired driver weaving down the road undetected because the \nsheriff's deputy or the State trooper or the police officer is \nbothering someone who is otherwise driving safely.\n  This amendment clearly tramples on the rights, the prerogatives, and \nthe jurisdiction that have long been the purview of the people in the \nStates. I don't believe mandates such as this initiative should come \nfrom any level of government. I was not for it as a State legislator or \na Governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia. However, if governments are \nto be making a decision on this, it ought to be the State governments, \nnot the U.S. Congress.\n  The logical regression is that somebody could make an argument that \npeople riding motorcycles are safer wearing helmets than not having \nhelmets. There are many States that do not have helmet laws. It is the \nright of the people of South Dakota, or whatever State it may be, to \nhave such helmet laws. The logic, of course, would be that the Federal \nGovernment could say all motorcycle riders have to wear helmets.\n  In my view, our State legislatures provide a much closer \nrepresentation of the views, the beliefs, and the will of the people in \ntheir respective constituencies, in their respective States all across \nour country. I am a firm believer that the laws of a particular State \ndo reflect the principles and the views of its constituents and how \nthey want to be governed.\n  I hope my colleagues realize that many States do not have primary \nseatbelt laws. In fact, 30 States do not. While New York and New Jersey \nhave primary enforcement, as do Maryland, Delaware, and California, \nthere are 30 States, from Maine to Virginia, to South Carolina, to \nFlorida, to Missouri, to Nevada, Idaho, Arizona, and Alaska, that do \nnot. If such seatbelt laws are desired, the citizens in these States \nwill elect representatives and State legislators who share this belief \nand who want to pass such a petty law.\n  A minority of the States currently have the primary enforcement of \nseatbelt laws. I am sure it has been considered by State legislatures. \nIt has been considered in Virginia for many years and debated as to the \nbenefits of primary seatbelt statutes. Never, though, has it been \nagreed to be the law of the Commonwealth of Virginia. In fact, just \nlast week the Virginia House of Delegates Transportation Committee \ntabled a measure that would have established a primary seatbelt law.\n  Again, I am often puzzled by the scant Federal nexus on this issue. \nIs it that State roads go through other States? For the Federal \nGovernment to usurp State authority on an issue that does not concern \nthe safety of the public but only the individual in my view is Federal \nmeddling at its worst, especially when coupled with repressive \nextortion.\n  When these issues are decided by State legislatures, all sorts of \ninteresting things come up. There is naturally the libertarian streak, \nwhich my good friend, the senior Senator from Virginia, and I will \ndiscuss from time to time. That is an issue. But, interestingly, some \nother issues will come up. Last year in the debate in the Virginia \nGeneral Assembly and the House of Delegates, Delegate Ken Melvin of \nPortsmouth, VA, voiced his opposition to a primary seatbelt law, \nstating: I know what happens when you are stopped by police, as a \nblack man in this country and in Virginia, in particular. He explained \nhow his son was harassed and pulled over numerous times for no apparent \nreason.\n\n  So we end up with concerns of driving and persecution of people on \naccount of their race. That is something to be decided in a State \nlegislature. I am not sure if every State has it. I am sure most places \nin Virginia do not have this problem. Nevertheless, that is the \ndiscussion that was held on the floor of Mr. Jefferson's capitol in the \nCommonwealth of Virginia.\n  The Virginia Legislature and the legislatures of other States, from \nAlaska to Florida and South Carolina, can discuss the impact of this on \nthe people of their States rather than have the Congress hold hostage \ndesperately needed funds for highways to make them comply with the one-\nsize-fits-all edict and agenda.\n  Proponents will say this initiative provides States with supposed \noptions. The reality is, by withholding highway funding, it is a de \nfacto mandate. I do not believe in blackmailing the people of the 30 \nStates, or any State with primary seatbelt laws for funding that their \ncitizens have paid into the Federal highway trust fund.\n  I have watched this debate very closely on the reauthorization. We \nhave heard the vast majority of Senators, thank goodness, laud the \npotential of this measure to create thousands of jobs in their States \nand obviously alleviating aggravating congestion in metropolitan and \nsuburban areas of our country. If that is the case, why should we, as a \nFederal Government, withhold any portion of this funding, given its \ngreat prospects for jobs and also its ability to improve the quality of \nlife? Our Commonwealth of Virginia would lose tens of millions of \ndollars until enacting a primary seatbelt law or convincing the federal \ngovernment ninety percent of Virginians are wearing seatbelts.\n  Given the congestion in Hampton Roads, northern Virginia, and the \nnumber of Virginians seeking employment, I cannot support a measure \nthat would reduce the amount of benefits available to Virginia.\n  I commend my friend and partner, Senator Warner, on what he has been \nable to do over many years in getting Virginia's share of Federal \ndollars up from 79 cents to 80 cents to 90 cents and, in this measure, \nup to 95 cents. But Virginia is already paying in more than we get \nback. In addition, punishing the people of Virginia by withholding \nuntil they are coerced in the\n\n[[Page S966]]\n\nlegislature into passing a primary enforcement of a seatbelt bill, to \nme, is wrong.\n  I know what they will have to do; they will have to pass it, just as \nthey had to pass in all the States raising the beer drinking age and \nthe .08 blood alcohol content maximum. The latter did not have an \nimpact in Virginia because as Governor I advocated .08 and we enacted \ninto law.\n  States need the funds for roads and transit. It is contrary to the \nbest interests of Virginia to force primary seatbelt mandates in \nexchange for funds. We ought to be making the most funding available \nfor highways rather than returning less of Virginia gasoline taxes to \nthem until they pass such an officious measure as this.\n  There are more effective ways to convince Americans to wear seatbelts \nwhen driving or traveling in an automobile or pickup truck. But \nmeddling into every aspect of our citizens' lives, usurping the \nauthority of the people through their legislatures, holding hostage \ninfrastructure funds that are so needed, to me, is not the appropriate \nmethod to realize these salutary goals.\n  As I said, I have a great deal of respect for Senator Warner. I know \nhe cares passionately about this issue, but I don't believe this is in \nthe best interests of the Commonwealth of Virginia or 49 other States. \nIn my view, it continues a dangerous precedent that allows the Federal \nGovernment to further encroach on an issue traditionally determined by \nthe States by withholding these infrastructure funds. This is simply \nnot an issue for the Senate. It is not an issue for Congress to decide. \nIt is clearly properly reserved to the people in the States.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in opposing this amendment, tabling \nit, however it comes before the Senate. I certainly do not want to play \nthe role of ``father knows best'' or senatorial nanny to coerce or \nreverse the decisions clearly made by my State's legislature or, for \nthat matter, 29 other States.\n  Let there be no mistake. I strongly support greater seatbelt usage. I \nbelieve it can save lives on our roads and highways. But I do not \nsupport that usage coming as a result of a dictate and blackmail from \n``Federales'' here in Washington, DC.\n\n  Let's not meddle with the laps of drivers driving safely down the \nroad as adults. Let's trust free people to make these decisions and \ntheir State legislatures as to what they think the laws and enforcement \nought to be, whether it is helmet laws or whether it is seatbelt laws. \nLet's also pass this otherwise beneficial bill that will help reduce \ncongestion and help create jobs in our country.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, will the distinguished Senator, my dear \nfriend, yield for some questions?\n  Mr. ALLEN. I would be happy to.\n  Mr. WARNER. I think as the two of us are here on the Senate floor, I \nam reminded that when Ben Franklin emerged from the Constitutional \nConvention, a reporter asked him: Well, what have the delegates to the \nconvention rendered America? He said: A republic, if you can keep it. \nAnd this is the very essence of the Republic, if we can keep it, \nbecause here we are, two of the best of friends, proud to represent the \nCommonwealth of Virginia, and 90 percent of the time we are aligned. \nYet our system allows the two of us to debate opposite positions on a \npiece of legislation I offered. I think that is magnificent, not only \nfor our State but for the country.\n  Mr. ALLEN. If I may, I would much rather be debating this issue with \nyour colleague on this, the junior Senator from New York. It would be \nmuch more enjoyable than with someone who is such a great partner. I \nyield back.\n  Mr. WARNER. I believe there would be somewhat greater notoriety, but \nI think some of the folks down in Virginia would be rather amused that \nhere we are, the two elected Senators, having an honest and forthright \ndebate, and in a friendly spirit.\n  But I picked up on one or two of your words. I know you love that \nword, Congress being the ``nanny.'' But, first, I ask my junior \nSenator, have I ever been a nanny toward you?\n  Mr. ALLEN. Of course not.\n  Mr. WARNER. Fine.\n  Mr. ALLEN. I wouldn't allow it, and you wouldn't either.\n  Mr. WARNER. So be it. Let's put that to one side.\n  Mr. ALLEN. I would say for the record, Mr. President, no, the senior \nSenator from Virginia has given me guidance but never in a sense of \nbeing an officious nanny whatsoever.\n  Mr. WARNER. Nor will I ever because I have tremendous respect for the \nSenator. We come to the Senate with different career backgrounds: You, \na very distinguished State legislator, then Governor, and now U.S. \nSenator. How well I know that. I campaigned as a U.S. Senator when you \nwere a State legislator, when you were running for the governorship, \nand then for the Senate. I am privileged and delighted that the Senator \nis here.\n  But you used one word I have to ask you to reconsider: This will \nestablish a dangerous precedent. I ask my good friend--Virginia has the \n.08 drinking law, which has been very effective. It has saved lives. \nThat is the purpose of this legislation, to save lives. To me, a little \nless concrete, a little less asphalt, and we may save a life, and we \nmay save thrusting expenses on the local communities--whether it is the \nsmall community of Hopewell, VA, or the large community of Richmond. \nWhen an accident happens, they are the ones who bear the cost of \nsending out the police, the rescue squads--fortunately, Virginians \nvolunteer in many instances--to attend to the wounded, the sick, and, \nindeed, the dying as a consequence of the accident.\n  That is costly, and it is clearly documented that we save lives with \nthe increase in the use of seatbelts. The Secretary of Transportation, \non behalf of the President, wrote this body a letter, addressed to the \ndistinguished chairman, Mr. Inhofe, which is in the Record. It \nexplicitly says the increase in the use of seatbelts saves lives. I do \nnot think throughout this debate--I have been here throughout this \ndebate--not one single Member of the Senate has taken the floor and \naddressed this legislation that it does not save lives. That is a \ngiven.\n  So let's go back to the .08 law. Is that not a direct precedent for \nthis piece of legislation? This legislation is drawn, sentence by \nsentence, comparable to the .08 law. That was my objective.\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. I say to my colleague, the senior Senator from Virginia, \nit is similar in some respects.\n  Let me make a few points. Talking about cost--local rescue squads, \nvolunteer fire departments, and so forth, having to work accidents--\nwell, it is not as if the State legislatures do not care about these \ncosts because, after all, if it is State police or if it is local \nsupervisors or whoever it may be, they all care about that as well. And \nthat is the proper forum for this because I think the people in the \nStates do care just as much if not more and are much more in tune with \nwhat they would like to do in their laws than the Federal Government.\n  The difference on .08--I did allude to it, and it is a good, \nprobative question--the .08 blood-alcohol level for drunk driving, or \ndriving while under the influence of alcohol, is something that I \nadvocated when you were alongside of me campaigning for Governor in \n1993. There was opposition to that. But I thought, as well as you do, \nthat at .08 most people are going to be impaired and, therefore, a \ndanger, in that case to themselves, but what I cared most about was the \ndanger to others.\n  In the case of somebody's lap, whether they are wearing a seatbelt or \nnot, if it is a danger, it is only a slight increase in danger to \nthemselves. It is not a danger to others on the road. Whereas, for \nsomebody who is a drunk driver, clearly it is going to be a danger to \nthemselves, but what might they do to an innocent pedestrian, somebody \nelse driving on the road? So even .08, while we had it--and so the \ndictate and the extortion, whatever term you want to use on .08, it did \nnot matter to Virginia because we had already passed that law, imagine \nthat, without the wisdom of Washington. We actually did that. The point \nis, in this case, unlike a drunk driver, not wearing a seatbelt is not \na danger to others, while a drunk driver is. And that is a distinction \nI would make.\n  But in either case, just personally--this is just philosophical to \nme, and maybe it is because of my experience serving in the State \nlegislature and as Governor--I think the people in the States are \nperfectly capable of making these judgments themselves. And to restrict \nor take away funds unless you\n\n[[Page S967]]\n\nfollow the dictates of the Federal Government in something that while \ndesirable is not really the proper jurisdiction of the Federal \nGovernment, to me, is just wrong.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I say to the Senator, I full well know, \nhaving had the privilege of working with you throughout much of our \npublic service careers, your strong feeling about States rights. And I \nhave mine also. But I have to tell the Senator, the facts do not bear \nout the assumption that that individual driving without the seatbelt is \nof minimal danger to an innocent person, be it a pedestrian or one in \nanother car, for this reason: It is very clear that if an accident \noccurs with an individual driving under the restraint of a seatbelt, he \nor she has, in that split fraction of a second, better control over the \ncar than one who is totally jostled out of the driver's position and \nloses the ability to operate the controls of the car because of the \nabsence of a restraint to keep that individual in the position of the \ndriver.\n  Now, the record is replete with those facts. Secondly, yes, you think \nthe people of Virginia--and we love them dearly and they will be on \nyour side, not on mine; they will be on your side--should make the \ndecision. But, tragically, for children, 6 out of 10 die who do not \nhave the seatbelt put on them.\n  By the driver putting on his or her seatbelt, there is more of an \ninclination, then, to do the same with the other passengers in the car. \nThe death on our highways today cuts into the young people, the younger \ngeneration coming along behind us far more deeply than our age group. \nThe main category of deaths in this country, on the highways, is \nbetween the ages of about 17 and 30. There is the preponderance of \ndeaths.\n  How well you know and I know when we were that age, you know: The \nlaws be damned; we can handle anything.\n  That is the magnificence of youth, the exuberance, to meet the \nchallenges, whatever they are, and ``don't tell me.'' I always admire \nthat flag of New Hampshire that says: Don't tread on me. But now and \nthen we have to tread ever so lightly upon our citizens to induce them \nto take those fundamental steps, not only to protect themselves but to \nprotect that innocent victim on the streets or in another vehicle.\n  This formula is drawn up, yes, that some funds are withheld if the \nState does not go ahead. We only lost by one vote in the Virginia \nGeneral Assembly on two occasions to get this very piece of \nlegislation. You acknowledge that fact.\n  Mr. ALLEN. It has failed for many years.\n  Mr. WARNER. One vote. All I am saying to you is, if you just require \nthe State, all right, if you don't do it, you will have to give up a \nlittle asphalt, a little more concrete, but in return we are saving \nlives, not only the lives of the young people in that car but the \ninnocent victims, the passengers of another vehicle, or the pedestrian. \nFor a very few cubic yards of concrete and asphalt, we may well save a \nlife.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, may I make a parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina). The Senator \nfrom Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Which of the two distinguished Senators from Virginia has \nthe floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator.\n  Mr. WARNER. I can answer that, the distinguished junior Senator has \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished junior Senator.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I imagine the manager of this measure, the \nchairman, Senator Inhofe, may want to speak on this. I will just say I \nvery much enjoyed listening to the arguments of my esteemed senior \ncolleague from Virginia, Senator Warner. I was just thinking, this is \nthe sort of argument that ought to be made in Mr. Jefferson's capital. \nIf you look at all the rest of the States, folks care about kids. There \nare laws requiring children under certain weights and ages to be in car \nseats and they do have to be buckled up.\n  Here you have the States of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, according \nto the Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, Massachusetts, Rhode \nIsland, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Virginia, Ohio, Kentucky, \nTennessee, South Carolina, Florida, Mississippi, Arkansas, Missouri, \nWisconsin, Minnesota that don't have primary enforcement of seatbelt \nlaws, they probably have secondary enforcement laws like Virginia. \nAdditionally, North and South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado, \nWyoming, Montana, Idaho, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, and Alaska.\n  Those folks, if they want to pass these laws, I guarantee, none of \nthem have anyone as articulate and persuasive and passionate and caring \nabout this issue and America than John Warner. I am not suggesting the \nSenator join a State legislature. But those folks can come to these \nconclusions. They can look at their statistics. They also could make \nthese decisions.\n  In addition to that, to say States that are sending Federal gas tax \nmoney up to Washington are going to get less back unless they comply \nwith an issue that is their purview, I think is wrong. It is an honest \ndisagreement, a difference in philosophy. I very much respect and \nappreciate Senator Warner's true and sincere beliefs. I still respect \nhim and always will. This will probably be a close vote. It is just to \nme a place we should not be dictating a course to the States in matters \nthat are rightfully their prerogative.\n  Mr. WARNER. Will the Senator yield for one further point?\n  Mr. ALLEN. I surely will.\n  Mr. WARNER. He enumerated a number of States that still do not have \nit. If you go back, as I have done, and studied the .08 law, it was \nvigorously resisted here on the floor of the Senate repeatedly for the \nvery same reasons you have given. But once it was passed and it became \nmandatory, suddenly the States joined up. There are now 49 States that \nhave the .08 law as a direct consequence of the Congress having given \nthe impetus for those additional States that were hanging out, all of \nwhich you just enumerated; in this instance they joined.\n\n  Lastly, I think it is also important in the debate to mention your \nown personal experience of an individual who was concerned that it \nwould begin to have cars pulled over by virtue of race. But one of the \nmost interesting individuals who attended a press conference the day \nbefore yesterday was a black legislator from Arkansas who is chairman \nof the National Conference of Black State Legislators. He brought with \nhim that organization's endorsement of this bill. So I do believe there \nis some legitimate difference within one minority with respect to the \nquestion of how this law will be felt.\n  Five States had 21 minimum drinking age, when President Reagan, your \nidol and mine, signed that into law. So I am just telling you, .08 is \nan example of how Congress finally acted, and then all the States, save \none--I won't mention the one; somebody can do their homework; it is \nrather curious which State it is--have accepted the .08 law.\n  I say to my good friend, we have had a marvelous debate. I have \nenjoyed it. My respect for him as a consequence of the debate has \nincreased, my dear friend.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Will the distinguished Senator from Virginia yield for \na question?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. ALLEN. What is the question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is asking the \nSenator to yield for a question.\n  Mr. ALLEN. I will yield, but before I do, I want to make a statement. \nAfter that I would be happy to answer a question.\n  This is the fundamental difference. On .08, as Governor, as a \ncandidate, I thought it was a great idea. The reason all the States \nhave the .08 but for one is because you are withholding or the Federal \nGovernment is saying we are going to withhold some of your highway \nfunds for it. It is blackmail. It is extortion, raising the beer-\ndrinking age in Virginia because of that. Ronald Reagan is my hero. He \nis the one who motivated me to get into organized politics. I think he \nwas wrong to do that. I think for people who are 18, the States can \nmake these decisions. They can enter into binding contracts. They can \nvote for President, vote for Members here, and they can also \ntheoretically be drafted to fight and potentially die for their \ncountry. I think the people of the States can make those decisions.\n  On this issue, in particular, the .08, I am with you, I am for it. I \nthink that\n\n[[Page S968]]\n\nshould be done at the State level. The mandatory seatbelt law and \nprimary enforcement is something that when I held Mr. Jefferson's seat \nin the House of Delegates I voted against. So if I have voted against \nit and was opposed to this nannyism when I was in the State \nlegislature, I know the air is more rarified up here, but I still have \nsome of those senses. I certainly do not want to do something in the \nSenate I would not want to do as a legislator and, moreover, tell the \nfolks in other States to do it.\n  With that, I yield to the junior Senator from New York.\n  Mr. WARNER. If I could just make one reply to my colleague and then \nwe will yield the floor. This bill is carefully crafted, that, yes, \nthere is a withholding of those yards of concrete and asphalt, but once \nthe State complies, what has been withheld by way of funds comes back \nto them to go right into the mainstream of their funding, not unlike \n.08.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Understood. I yield to the Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. With respect to this legislation that I am a proud \ncosponsor of, along with the key sponsor and advocate, the senior \nSenator from Virginia, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Corzine be \nadded as a cosponsor as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. With respect to the debate that has been occurring, I \nunderstand the concerns raised by the Senator from Virginia, but under \nthis amendment States would have the option of either enacting a \nprimary seatbelt law or bringing their seatbelt usage rates up to 90 \npercent without such a law. Therefore, it is an option provided today. \nWould the Senator from Virginia agree that the lack of seatbelt usage \ncauses up to 30,000 people a year to die in automobile accidents that \noccur on our highways and byways in this country?\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I say to the junior Senator from New York--\nher question was do I agree that not wearing seatbelts causes 30,000 \ndeaths? No. Not wearing them doesn't cause death; death is caused when \nsomebody is drunk or impaired by drugs, not paying attention, or \nspeeding, or taking a turn too quickly. The sole fact of not wearing a \nseatbelt is not the proximate cause of the death. Whereas, if you look \nat the statistics, impaired driving is clearly the No. 1 cause of \nfatalities, and not just of drivers but also those who are not.\n  Having said that, I do think it is a good idea to wear seatbelts. I \nhave no objection to it. I think airbags are a great invention. There \nwere those in previous years wanting to dictate to the manufacturers to \nput airbags on their cars. People realized that airbags could save \nlives. Whether somebody is wearing a seatbelt or not, of course, the \nmaximum safety is the airbag. Car manufacturers are using that \naccessory as a selling point rather than a Government dictate. But not \nwearing a seatbelt does not proximately cause death.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I clearly have a fundamental \ndisagreement with the views of the junior Senator from Virginia. I hope \nour colleagues will look at the facts. The facts are that failure to \nenforce seatbelt laws, to make it absolutely clear that there are \npenalties associated with not wearing seatbelts, causes deaths from \naccidents that would otherwise not cause fatalities.\n  This amendment will help us encourage States to adopt stricter \nseatbelt laws. We give them an option. I hope our colleagues will join \nwith us in voting for this very important safety measure.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding the floor.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I do yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2311\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate concerning the outsourcing \n                           of American jobs)\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I also rise today to offer an amendment \nthat is a sense of the Senate on an issue I spoke briefly about on the \nfloor yesterday. I know the majority leader and several others touched \non it this morning. It is regarding the issue of jobs and the \nadministration's economic policies.\n  This sense-of-the-Senate amendment is on an issue that is of critical \nimportance to New Yorkers and all Americans, the loss of jobs in our \ncountry. We have lost 2.2 million jobs since the beginning of this \nadministration. This sense of the Senate is not about cutting or \nraising taxes; it is about protecting the jobs that Americans have \ntoday, because these 2.2 million people are not statistics; they are \nfactory workers, office workers, laborers, engineers, radiologists--\npeople holding down jobs in every sector of the economy throughout our \nNation.\n  Why are they losing jobs? Because this administration has failed to \nprovide the leadership or put forth an economic plan that inspires \nconfidence in our markets and inspires investments by our companies in \nthe United States.\n  So where are these dollars and investments going? They are going \noverseas, where companies don't have the same environment and labor \nstandards, and where they don't have to pay the wages that are \nnecessary to support a middle-class lifestyle in America.\n  Now, these lost jobs are a tremendous concern to those of us in this \nChamber. I hear about it everywhere I travel in New York. You would \nthink if there could be a consensus on anything in this Nation, it \nwould be on how we keep jobs in America, how we prevent jobs from being \noutsourced, sent overseas. But apparently there is no consensus. That \nis what is troubling me.\n  According to the Los Angeles Times yesterday, ``Bush Supports Shift \nof Jobs Overseas.'' I did a double take. I could not believe that was \nthe headline. The L.A. Times wasn't the only newspaper surprise. The \nSeattle Times headline read: ``Bush Report: Sending Jobs Overseas Helps \nU.S.'' The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported: ``Bush Economic Report \nPraises `Outsourcing' Jobs.'' The Orlando Sentinel said: ``Bush Says \nSending Jobs Abroad Can be Beneficial?''\n  Where did this come from? It came right from the White House. \nAccording to Gregory Mankiw, the President's chair of the Council of \nEconomic Advisers:\n\n       Outsourcing is just a new way of doing international trade. \n     More things are tradable than were tradable in the past. And \n     that's a good thing.\n\n  I know the Presiding Officer shares my concern about lost jobs. He \nsees it in his State, as I see it in my State. I don't think losing \nAmerican jobs is a good thing. The folks at the other end of \nPennsylvania Avenue apparently do. Maybe that is because they have no \nreal strategy of creating jobs in America. Maybe that is why in this \nbudget they have sent up they are gutting investments in workforce \ntraining and dislocated worker help, and they are not pushing for \nstricter standards in trade agreements on labor and the environment. \nThey are really coming forward with no plan to help control health care \ncosts or pension costs facing American companies.\n  The only economic policy they have is to cut taxes, cut taxes, cut \ntaxes. The more, the merrier. Give those CEOs and wealthy folks at the \ntop even more money to take jobs and move them out of our country.\n  It is all starting to make sense. The administration thinks moving \njobs overseas is a good thing. This is part and parcel of a set of \neconomic policies that are out of touch with the needs of America's \nworking people.\n  I now send this amendment to the desk. I hope this Congress will take \nup this issue as quickly as possible, because we need to send a clear \nmessage to Americans of all political persuasions, in all regions of \nour country, that we care about jobs. If the administration doesn't \nhave a strategy, then this Congress will have a strategy. I ask for \nimmediate consideration of this amendment, and I ask that Senator \nBingaman be added as a cosponsor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York [Mrs. Clinton], for herself and \n     Mr. Bingaman, proposes an amendment numbered 2311.\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING THE OUTSOURCING OF \n                   AMERICAN JOBS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n\n[[Page S969]]\n\n       (1) the President's Chairman of the Council of Economic \n     Advisors recently described the outsourcing of American jobs \n     overseas ``as a good thing'' and said, ``outsourcing is just \n     a new way of doing international trade'';\n       (2) the President's economic policies have either failed to \n     address or exacerbated the loss of manufacturing jobs that \n     our country has experienced over the last 3 years;\n       (3) American families are facing an economy with the fewest \n     jobs created since the Great Depression;\n       (4) 2,900,000 private sector jobs have been lost since \n     January 2001, including 2,800,000 manufacturing jobs;\n       (5) on several occasions the Senate has supported reforming \n     our tax laws to eliminate policies that make it cheaper to \n     move jobs overseas; and\n       (6) job creation is essential to the economic stability of \n     the United States and the Administration should pursue \n     policies that serve as an engine for economic growth, higher \n     wage jobs, and increased productivity.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the Senate should--\n       (1) oppose any efforts to encourage the outsourcing of \n     American jobs overseas; and\n       (2) adopt legislation providing for a manufacturing tax \n     incentive to encourage job creation in the United States and \n     oppose efforts to make it cheaper to send jobs overseas.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2286\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, yesterday I had an opportunity to offer \nthe amendment which is now pending before the Senate and to engage in \ndebate with my colleagues on the important issue of increasing the use \nof seatbelts in this country.\n  At the request of my colleague, the manager of the bill, Chairman \nInhofe, my amendment was modified last night to give States a full 2 \nyears before it takes effect.\n  I wish to take a few moments to summarize this amendment and be sure \nthat my colleagues understand precisely what this amendment is and what \nit is not.\n  To the point, this amendment is not a mandatory seatbelt law.\n  This amendment sets as our national policy that States are to reach a \n90-percent seatbelt use rate by 2006--a full 2 years from now.\n  States can meet this goal in two ways. First, they can meet this goal \nby any means or programs they devise. They can implement new programs \nor modify their existing occupant protection programs. Funding is also \nprovided to assist States with implementing or expanding their existing \nprograms. This language is identical to the provisions recommended in \nthe administration's bill, but it is not included in the bill before \nus.\n  States can also meet the requirements of the amendment by enacting a \nprimary seatbelt law.\n  This 90-percent belt use rate is not a number that I have invented. \nIt is the figure recommended in the President's highway reauthorization \nbill.\n  Wearing seatbelts is a critical public health and safety issue. For \nthe first time in a decade, highway deaths are on the rise. In 2002, \nnearly 43,000 persons were killed on our highways and over half of \nthese deaths involved people who were not wearing their seatbelt.\n  If for no other reason to support this amendment, we must protect our \nNation's youth. Today, automobile crashes are the leading cause of \ndeath for Americans age 2 to 34.\n  These tragic statistics are reversible if we take action today.\n  That is why over 130 organizations are endorsing this amendment. The \nsupport includes major national organizations such as the American \nMedical Association, law enforcement officials, major insurance \ncompanies, the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, Mothers Against \nDrunk Driving, and the list goes on.\n  These are the people who deal every day with the wasteful and \navoidable deaths on our highways. They are on the front lines in \nresponding to a crash. They are in our hospitals providing care to \nthose who have sustained serious injuries because a seatbelt was not \nworn. They are the ones who see ever-increasing insurance costs for all \nAmericans because seatbelts are not used. They are the ones who know \nthat safety devices in our cars--such as air bags and enhanced \nbumpers--are less effective when seatbelts are not worn.\n  My colleagues who do not support this amendment have read letters of \nconcern from State groups and others. That is no surprise. At every \nturn in our Federal transportation policy for the past 15 years these \nsame groups have opposed every public safety initiative. They opposed \nraising the minimum drinking age to 21, they opposed the zero tolerance \nfor minors alcohol program, and they opposed the .08 BAC drunk driving \nlevel.\n  My only interest is to ensure that this critically important \nlegislation contains some meaningful protections for drivers and \npassengers.\n  In TEA-21, there was a 40-percent increase in construction funding, \nwhich I proudly supported, to make our roads safer. Yet, traffic deaths \nare increasing. In SAFETEA, there is a $65 billion increase for highway \nconstruction, yet inadequate protections for our drivers. No \nengineering features of our roads will protect against reckless driving \nbehavior. That is what causes a majority of our accidents.\n  Unbelted drivers, speed, and alcohol remain the three biggest safety \nproblems on our roads--not unsafe roads. We are taking meaningful steps \nto get tough on those who irresponsibly use alcohol and drive. Now it \nis time to do what we know works to address the other major problem--\nunbelted drivers.\n  For the benefit of my colleagues, let me summarize the amendment. \nStates are to achieve a 90 percent belt use rate by 2006--2 years from \nnow--or have a primary seatbelt law enacted.\n  If a State does not meet either of these two provisions, 5 percent of \none category of their construction funds are transferred to their \nhighway safety programs. The purpose of this transfer is to provide \nStates with additional funding to dedicate to their own programs to \nencourage drivers and passengers to wear their seatbelts.\n  If by 2008--4 years from now--a State has not met the 90 percent belt \nuse rate or has not enacted a primary seatbelt law, 2 percent of a \nportion of their construction funds are withheld. For each of the \nfollowing years, 4 percent of a portion of their funds are withheld.\n  States will receive any funding that is withheld when they reach the \n90 percent belt use rate, or enact a primary safety belt law. This is \nthe same provision that is law today for the .08 BAC drunk driving \nstandard. Since it was enacted in 2001, 47 States now comply.\n  There is a solution to the tragic deaths that are occurring on our \nhighways every day. This amendment is the beginning. Let's do what we \nknow works to save lives on our highways.\n  Let's not pass the buck by believing that it is the responsibility of \nothers to take action. It is our responsibility. I urge my colleagues \nnot to support the motion to table.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, as always, the Senator from Virginia was \nvery courteous yesterday to modify his amendment to give States more \ntime to comply with the requirements of his amendment. I sincerely \nappreciate his willingness to do so. Unfortunately, my underlying \nconcern with imposing sanctions still requires that I oppose the \namendment.\n  Two days ago, the U.S. Department of Transportation released a \nstatement on sanctions and withholding Federal funds from States which \ndo not have a primary seatbelt law. The statement reads as follows, and \nI quote:\n\n       The Bush Administration's continuing efforts to increase \n     local enforcement and education have boosted safety belt use \n     to the highest level in U.S. history. The Administration \n     opposes sanctions and withholding state funds, both of which \n     would jeopardize important state-level safety programs and \n     infrastructure maintenance programs already in place.\n       The Administration is working hard to help pass primary \n     safety belt laws throughout the country, and we're seeing \n     results. Twenty states and the District of Columbia already \n     have primary laws. And many other states, including Florida, \n     South Carolina, Ohio, Arizona and Virginia are currently \n     considering primary laws--with our help, not with mandates.\n       The Administration calls on Senator Warner to join us in \n     helping Virginia state legislators understand the need for a \n     primary safety belt use law.\n\n  As I said yesterday, I support the use of seatbelts, and I would \nsuggest that instead of threatening the states with a stick the better \napproach would be to\n\n[[Page S970]]\n\ninduce them to achieve better performance in this area with some kind \nof incentive. Title IV, Surface Transportation Safety, of the pending \nsubstitute, contains an incentive grant program. As proposed by the \nCommerce Committee, this $100 million per year incentive grant \nprovision would go a long way to achieving the goals that I believe my \ncolleague from Virginia is trying to accomplish in his amendment.\n  Offering incentive grants to States that pass a primary seatbelt law \nor increase their seatbelt use rate is a much better approach to this \nproblem than combination of mandates and penalties. History has also \nshown that so far, no State has been able to achieve the benchmark \nlevel of a 90 percent seatbelt use rate without enacting a primary law. \nUltimately we all know that the decision to pass a primary law is up to \neach state individually. Although neither a sanction, nor an incentive \napproach is guaranteed to prod every State to produce results, the \nincentive method is the much better option. In a bill where money is \ntight, I am grateful that the Commerce Committee saw fit to apply some \nof those limited funds to this purpose. With that in mind, I question \nwhat the benefit would be of having both an incentive and a penalty, \nwhere just an incentive would do.\n  Currently, only 20 of the 50 States meet the requirements laid out in \nthe mandate offered by the good senator from Virginia. I can't get over \nthe fact that 30 States would be immediately thrust into noncompliance \nand subject to a possible cut in Federal funding under this plan.\n  As I have said before, my home State of Oklahoma is already in \ncompliance with the requirements proposed in this new sanction, but I \nfundamentally oppose any imposition of new sections. As much as I \npersonally agree with using seatbelts, I have to recognize that the \nonly proper place for this decision to be made is in each State \nlegislature, not in Washington, DC.\n  Mr. President, I move to table the Warner amendment No. 2286, as \nmodified, and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to table amendment No. \n2286, as modified. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nEdwards) and the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would vote ``nay.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski).

Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to change my vote since it will not affect the outcome.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The foregoing tally has been changed to reflect the above order.)\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I rise to discuss a second-degree \namendment that I intend to offer. It deals with a very important \nproblem in the national interest--assuring that rental and leasing car \noperations can be performed in all 50 States.\n  Right now there are several States which have something called \nunlimited bicarious liability. Under this, if a leasing company leases \na car or a vehicle to a person who appears to be a reasonable and \nresponsible driver who meets all of the requirements, and that person \ngoes out and has a horrendous accident, in a few States the victims and \nthe personal injury lawyers are enabled to sue the leasing company \nwhich had no control over the car or truck or van and had no evidence \nof negligence or shortcomings in their procedures in leasing that \nvehicle. There have been hundreds of millions of dollars of judgments.\n  We have seen in a small number of States liability being imposed on \nrental and leasing companies without fault. It has cost car and truck \nrenting and leasing companies more than $100 million annually. The \nproblem is these costs don't just come out of the pockets of those in \nthat State; they are paid nationally.\n  When any of us go to rent or lease a car, we are paying far more than \nwe otherwise would because they have had to cover the costs of \noutrageously high judgments imposed by a few States which allow this \nbicarious liability language and bicarious notion to apply.\n  In other words, if you are in New York, for example, and you have \nleased a car, if you go out and hit somebody, it doesn't matter whether \nthe leasing company is at fault. The leasing company is the one that is \nsued. If there is $100 million judgment against that company, guess who \npays for it. Not the people who lease the car in New York but all of us \nas consumers who may go out to lease a car in all of the 50 States.\n  Therefore, the amendment I am proposing says provided there is no \nnegligence or criminal wrongdoing on the part of the owner of a motor \nvehicle, no such owner engaged in the trade or business of renting or \nleasing motor vehicles may be held liable under State law for harm \ncaused by a person to himself or herself, another person, or to \nproperty which results or arises from that person's use, operation, or \npossession of a rented or leased motor vehicle by reason of being the \nowner of such motor vehicle.\n  In other words, if the owner of the vehicle hasn't done anything \nwrong--there has been no negligence, no criminal wrongdoing--but the \nperson who leases that car goes out and has a horrendous wreck, the \nperson who has leased the car is the one who ought to be held \nresponsible.\n\n  We should not have to finance jackpot judgments against leasing \ncompanies that pass those costs on to all of us across the Nation \nwhenever we go to lease or rent a car or a van. Consumers nationwide \nare being hurt by these higher rates--not just consumers in the \nbicarious liability States.\n  These laws apply where the accident occurs. It does not matter \nwhether the car or truck was rented or leased. Since companies cannot \nprevent their vehicles from being driven to a bicarious liability \nState, they cannot prevent their exposure to these laws, and they have \nto raise their rates for all of us accordingly.\n  In addition, we have also seen that these higher costs drive many \nsmall companies out of business. Actually, a small company trying to \nengage in the business of renting or leasing may find itself caught in \none of these bicarious liability States and wind up with a judgment \nthat puts them out of business. This is a death knell for small\n\n[[Page S971]]\n\nbusinesses in the leasing and rental business. That is why we have to \ndo something about it.\n  Accident victims in bicarious liability States would not be left out \nin the cold. They would be compensated according to the same standard \nused by the vast majority of States which do not have bicarious \nliability laws.\n  More importantly, accident victims in the same bicarious liability \nState would no longer be treated differently based solely on whether a \nvehicle involved was rented or leased instead of individually owned. In \nother words, if you are hit by a negligent driver in any State, file \nsuit against that driver and collect a judgment against that driver \nlogically to be paid by the insurance company of that driver, or if it \nis self-insured then that driver would have to pay out of his pocket.\n  That same standard still applies. What we are saying is you can't \nreach out and bring in somebody who had nothing to do with the accident \nand was not at fault. When we do that, we are going to provide relief \nfor small businesses. We are going to provide relief to the people who \nlease cars and rent cars and vans across the Nation.\n  This provision would not allow a company to escape liability if they \nwere at fault or negligent in an accident in any way.\n  I ask that it be supported by my colleagues.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2327 To Amendment No. 2311\n\n  Mr. BOND.

Rented or leased motor vehicle safety and responsibility.''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I rise today to talk about the 2.4 \nmillion jobs that have been lost in this country. As we discuss \ninvestment in infrastructure, we need to keep in mind that investment \nin human infrastructure is just as appropriate. There are families out \nthere who are continuing to struggle to put food on the table, make \nsure they can take care of their mortgage payment, and make sure they \ncan take care of individual hospital and insurance needs. I ask my \ncolleagues to put themselves in the position of working men and women \nwho have lost their jobs and now have no means to take care of their \nfamily needs.\n  We have been before this body dozens of times now in the last several \nmonths asking for an extension of unemployment benefits because the \neconomy has not truly recovered--certainly has not recovered from the \n2.4 million jobs that have been lost. Yet dozens of times my colleagues \non the other side of the aisle have objected. They have objected to \nthis extension because they say we are in fine economic shape.\n  I will bet you that families trying to figure out how they meet those \nmortgage payments would disagree with the kind of shape my colleagues \nthink the economy is in.\n  In fact, in December, 90,000 people per week started exhausting their \nunemployment benefits and had no Federal program to pick them up. That \nis \\1/2\\ million people who have gone without aid since the program \nstopped accepting new applicants. Put yourself in that position and \nunderstand that if unemployment benefits are not extended--and the \neconomy grows at a very slow pace--by the end of the year, 2 million \npeople will be cut off from this program. For people without a paycheck \nor an unemployment check, that means their families will continue to be \nforced to make very tough decisions.\n  A recent poll showed that over one-half of the unemployed adults \nfound they had to postpone medical treatment or cut back on food. One \nin four has had to actually move out of their house because of the cuts \nin unemployment extension programs. More than one-third have had \ntrouble paying gas or electric bills. I am sure in my State the number \nwould be more than one-third, given our high energy rates. My amendment \nreinstates the Federal Insurance Unemployment Benefit Program and \nprovides 13 additional weeks of benefits to all States, carrying us \nthrough June.\n\n  My colleagues ask, Why should we do this? The economy is recovering. \nIf we look at the facts and figures and compared them to the last time \nwe had a recession, this point where we are in our economy is still \nvery disappointing. Last Friday, economists came out, for example, with \na report on our job growth and said it was ``well below market \nexpectations,'' and confirmed that jobs in the markets in the United \nStates are still weak. While the economy created about 110,000 jobs \nlast month--and that is a step in the right direction--it is a pretty \nsmall step in the direction we need to go.\n  My State of Washington, obviously, has faced a lot of downturn \nbecause of Boeing, because of high tech, and because many workers \nthroughout the State have been laid off as subsidiaries to those large \ncorporations and interests.\n  I hear colleagues on the other side of the aisle saying once the \neconomy starts to recover, that is when we need to cut off unemployment \nbenefits because people can still find jobs. The point is during the \n1990s, we had an extension of unemployment benefits to take care of the \ndownturn we were facing in the economy, both started by the first Bush \nadministration and then by the Clinton administration, to help take \ncare of unemployment problems.\n  During that time period in the early 1990s recession, we were \noffering unemployment benefits for a 27-month period of time. During \nthat 27-month period of time, we actually saw an increase in 2.9 \nmillion jobs. The program worked well as the economy continued to \nrebound and add more jobs. In the 1990s, under two administrations, a \nRepublican and a Democrat, we said, let's extend unemployment benefits \nfor 27 months. The net result was 2.9 million\n\n[[Page S972]]\n\njobs were created and we curtailed the benefit program.\n  We have had this recession and downturn and we have only been going \nfor 22 months of this program. We have only been giving people who have \nbeen affected by this downturn in our economy 22 months of unemployment \nextension. During that same period we have actually seen a net loss of \n2.4 million jobs.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle say when the economy \npicks up, we should curtail this program. What they should really ask \nis how many jobs have we created during this time period, and are \nAmericans finding jobs? If they are not finding jobs, how can we cut \nthem off from unemployment benefits that are actually a stimulus to the \neconomy in helping to pay the mortgage payments, covering health \ninsurance, keeping families in their home, and not deterring us from \neconomic growth? Every dollar spent on unemployment insurance generates \nan additional $2 into local economies.\n  Let's look at it a little differently during this time period of \nunemployment benefits. The line on this chart during 2002 continues to \ngo down into the red. This is where we are thinking about cutting off \nunemployment benefits. Yet we have had no job growth. Juxtaposed to \nwhat we did in the 1990s, we continued to increase the unemployment \nbenefits as the economy grew and we did a better match of keeping \nAmericans with some paycheck or unemployment check, thereby keeping our \neconomy at a more steady rate.\n\n  I say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, it is time to \nstop denying working Americans who have lost their jobs, through no \nfault of their own, from some sort of help and assistance when they can \nactually find no jobs.\n  I will point out a few of my constituents who have written to me. One \nfrom Camano Island said he cashed out every dime of his 401 saving \nplan, with significant penalties, and does not know how he will make \nhis mortgage payment, does not know what he is going to do, as the \nbenefits are expiring. Another constituent from Everett, WA, in the \nmanufacturing area, applied for over 200 jobs and received 4 interviews \nin the last year. They are trying to find opportunities but they do not \nexist. Another technology worker from Seattle has 25 years' experience \nand has been laid off since 2001 and is unable to find a job. Another \nworker from Seattle was working at a print company and over 500 people \nwere laid off in 2 years as their company was sold overseas to a \nmultinational company. In his individual situation he has tried to \ncover both the health insurance for himself and his wife. \nUnfortunately, he had some very severe health problems and had to get a \nkidney from his wife and ended up with some severe health problems and \nhe does not know how he will address those problems in the future \nbecause of these benefits being curtailed and his inability to cover \nhealth insurance.\n  Many people in my State ask what we are going to do about these \nunemployment benefits and whether we are going to remember the working \nmen and women in our State who have continued to deal with this issue.\n  There are many constituents who ask, what will it take to get the \nother side of the aisle to own up to the responsibility that there are \nnot jobs being created at a fast enough pace to put Americans back to \nwork. Our past bipartisan efforts by two administrations, a Republican \nand a Democratic, did far better in addressing this issue than we are \ndoing today.\n  I ask my colleagues to support a temporary emergency employment \ncompensation program through June. It is the only responsible thing to \ndo, to recognize that men and women of this country would rather have a \njob than an unemployment check. Without a check and without \nopportunities for jobs, we are doing neither them nor our economy any \nservice. We need to do the responsible thing and put them back to work. \nThat is why I am asking my colleagues to do the fair thing and expand \nthis program through June with 13 weeks going to each State. Until \nthen, we will not have the necessary tools to help Americans. Let's \nhelp them with the unemployment benefits and put them back to work.\n  I ask unanimous consent we lay aside the pending amendment and \nconsider this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to laying aside the pending \namendment?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Reserving the right to object, could you repeat this \nunanimous consent request?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I move the pending amendment be set aside and that this \namendment be considered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, let me be clear to my colleagues what \njust happened in the Senate. That is, that for about the dozenth time \nnow, the Senate is not going to consider unemployment benefit \nextensions. We are not going to consider whether working men and women \nin this country who have been unemployed, through no fault of their \nown, but a general downturn in the economy, many who have been impacted \nby September 11, many who have been impacted by the recession hit by \nmany companies that have been impacted by September 11, are not going \nto get our help in the extension of this program, that if these same \nmen and women happened to have been unemployed in the 1990s, their \nplight would have been different. They would have gotten help from the \nadministration. They would have gotten help from my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle.\n\n  So what we have done today is continue to say to unemployed \nAmericans, while the economy is just barely beginning to produce jobs, \nwe expect you now to move out of your house, deal with not being able \nto cover health insurance, not being able to meet your family \nobligations, while we continue to struggle to find jobs in this \ncountry.\n  I think it is irresponsible. I think my colleagues should make sure \nwe have a vote on this amendment. We will continue, on this side of the \naisle, to offer this amendment until we get a vote on it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, most of us who had an opportunity to \nget home to our own States and perhaps travel around the country \nrecently have found a number of concerns of working families. It is \npretty uniform. I certainly have found it so in my travels in the State \nof New Hampshire and Iowa, out in the Southwest, Midwest, over recent \nweeks.\n  One of the enduring issues, I find, that is uniform across the \ncountry is the state of our economy. It is reflected in a variety of \ndifferent ways. It might be reflected in one family which finds that \nincreased college tuition is putting an extreme burden on a family \nbudget. Maybe another family has the high cost of prescription drugs \nthat is putting an extraordinary burden on those under Medicare and \nSocial Security and the savings of other members of the family. It may \nbe those who have lost jobs and have gotten back in the job market and \nactually found a job, but they are concerned because their incomes are \ngenerally 23, 24, 25-percent less with the new job than the old job.\n  By and large, the state of our economy is an ongoing concern, and it \ndoesn't have to be this way. We have seen when we have had strong \nPresidential leadership--and the most recent case was with President \nClinton where we had extraordinary economic growth, price stability, \nvirtually free from inflation, and we had the creation of 22 million \njobs. I don't think an administration can continuously say that jobs \nare going to be better, that we are having a military conflict, we \ninherited a recession, and there is nothing more we can do. I reject \nthat, and I think most economists do, and many political leaders do as \nwell.\n  We have to look at what we can do in a very temporary way in the \nSenate. One of the mechanisms that we can provide is to extend the \nunemployment compensation for men and women who have paid into that \nfund over the years, and now we are seeing that Republicans are \nblocking having even a\n\n[[Page S973]]\n\ntemporary extension of unemployment compensation funds, even though the \nfund itself is in surplus of some $17 billion. That is being rejected.\n  As a matter of fact, we are seeing parliamentary gymnastics being \nused on the floor of the Senate to even prohibit a vote in the Senate \nto get accountability by Members of the Senate on this issue. Those on \nthe other side say: No way; we are going to use the parliamentary \ngymnastics so you will not even get a vote, Senator Cantwell, on your \nunemployment issue, and, no, Senator Clinton, on one of the glaring \neconomic policy issues of this administration, and that is shipping \njobs overseas. Can you imagine that? The administration's spokesperson \nsaid shipping jobs overseas is to the advantage of the American \neconomy.\n  Why don't we debate that on the Senate floor and find out who on the \nother side wants to defend shipping jobs overseas? You cannot travel \naround this country and go to any community and not hear workers' fear \nabout outsourcing and shipping jobs overseas. You cannot do it. Here, \nthe Senator from New York wants to get a debate and discussion about \nwhat we ought to do about that. Members of this body have ideas on what \nwe ought to be doing and they want to express their views. But, no, \nthey are cut off. No. No, you cannot do it. We are going to use the \nrules of the Senate to prohibit that kind of discussion and debate and \nprohibit some kind of resolution, some accountability by Members. Maybe \nthere are those who want to do it.\n  I think the American people would have more respect for us if we vote \nup or down on that resolution. But, no, our Republican friends say, no, \nwe don't want to--I say this--embarrass our Members by having to take a \ntough vote on it. I don't blame them. But it is poor solace to those \nworkers when they find out at last what the economic policies of this \nadministration are and they value sending the jobs overseas. That is \nwhat we are going to attempt.\n\n  Madam President, I want to review what the job situation has been \nover the period of these recent years and measure where we are with \nwhat was actually predicted by President Bush and the Bush \nadministration. I think by looking at this at least we can begin to \nunderstand why the Senator from Washington, Ms. Cantwell, wanted to \nhave an extension of the unemployment compensation. Ninety thousand \nworkers a week are losing their unemployment compensation.\n  I don't know how they get by. You are going to see that real wages \nhave gone down. Most families are having a tough time, and they live \nfrom paycheck to paycheck. They are paying the mortgage, putting food \non the table, and clothing their children, perhaps putting something \naside for higher education. How are they going to deal with the fact \nthat when they lose jobs, through no fault of their own, they are going \nto be denied a helping hand to deal with the cyclical factors that \nimpacted our economy?\n  Look at what this chart shows. This says: ``Every year, job growth \nfalls short of the Bush promises.'' This goes back to the year 2001. \nThe difference between what this administration promised in 2001 and \nwhere we are today is represented by 5.2 million jobs. Do you \nunderstand that? The promise in 2002 was that we would have 5.2 million \njobs more than we have today. We missed the prediction by 5 million \njobs. Now, in 2003, the President makes a different judgment about \nwhere we are going to be in 2003. He is only off by 2.5 million jobs \nfor 2003. This line represents what was predicted by the Bush \nadministration in 2002. This line here is what they predicted in 2003, \nand this orange line is the reality.\n  Let's look at it in another way. This chart shows a purple line, what \nwas actually predicted by the Bush administration for 2002 promise. \nThese are the number of new jobs predicted. We heard the other day \nabout the administration predicting new jobs. All you have to do is \nlook at their predictions over time and you can see how much value we \nought to give those predictions. Here it is: 2001 is the purple line, \nand 2002 is the green line, 2003 is the blue line, all going up there. \nThe actual jobs are represented by the red line, showing that we have \nlost 2.5 million jobs. Those are the facts.\n  As a result of the fact that we have lost those 2.5 million jobs, \nlet's just look at what has happened in terms of the average wages for \nthe jobs that we have retained in the United States. The jobs gained do \nnot pay as much as the jobs lost, this chart says. This is the average \nwage--the national average for 2001, which was $44,570. Today, it is \n$30,410. That is a reduction of 21 percent for average wages for \nworkers in this country.\n  Not only have we seen the loss of jobs, but even for the jobs that \nhave been retained, we have seen the income going down, headed south. \nNot only is this the reality of what is happening in the job market, \nbut also our Republican friends want to eliminate any opportunity for \nthese families to gain additional funds with overtime. That is what is \nhappening out there across this country.\n  Now we hear, well, we have had a recession, but we have come out of \nthe recession and everything is going to be OK. Everything is just \ngoing to be hunky-dory in terms of the labor market area and wages for \nAmerican workers.\n  Look at this chart. If you compare what happened in the 1990s, up \nthrough 1998, and to the year 2000, in the fourth quarter of each of \nthe recessions that took place during that period of time, you will \nfind in the last quarter of the recession during that period of 8 to 10 \nyears, the job was paying $18.30 an hour. The old jobs were paying \n$16.31 an hour. Now in this last recovery that this administration says \nis so great, look at this: The average job was paying $16.92 an hour, \nand the new jobs are paying $15.65 an hour. The new jobs are paying a \ngood deal less. It says just what the other chart says.\n  So not only are we not reaching the job goals, they missed it by 5 \nmillion. Even the jobs that are being created, the pay is 20, 25 \npercent less.\n  Let's look at what has happened in terms of the number of those who \nare long-term unemployed. Look at this chart. Compared to what it was \nin January 2000, when we had 680,000 people unemployed, it was 1.9 \nmillion people in January of 2004. These are the long-term unemployed. \nThese are the men and women who have been looking for jobs, trying to \nget jobs. This doesn't even measure the number of people who have \nbecome so discouraged, they are not even looking any longer.\n  We have an enormous number of people who are looking for jobs. This \nchart is probably more reflective of the problem. From 1973 to 2003, \nthe average number of unemployed in January: 151,000. That is through \ngood times and recessions. Today it is 375,000. These figures are from \nthe Center for Budget and Policy Priorities. It is 375,000, more than \ndouble the average. That is why we are asking: Why can't we reach out \nto these workers? These are hard-working Americans who paid into the \nfund over a long period and are entitled to those payments.\n  The fund is $17 billion in surplus. The proposal of Senator Cantwell \nwould cost $7 billion. We have 90,000 workers a week who are losing out \non this amount. Look at the contrast between this administration and \nthe previous administration on unemployment compensation to workers. \nLet's look at the difference.\n  In the early 1990s, when we were facing a recession, coming into \n1990, 1991, and early 1992, we had an increase in unemployment. The \nprevious administration, the Clinton administration, kept the extension \non unemployment compensation until we had grown 2.9 million jobs. Then \nthey terminated it, as they should; we were in a period of very \nsignificant expansion.\n  Look at where we are now. We have lost 2.4 million jobs, and we have \nterminated unemployment compensation.\n  Do you see the contrast between the two administrations and how they \nreached out to working families? Nonetheless, we are denied the \nopportunity to even consider an amendment that was going to be offered \nby the Senator from Washington to permit some 6 months and have the \ntemporary workers.\n  This is what is happening as a result: We have a decline in \npurchasing power for workers; we have an administration that is against \novertime, an administration that is against extending unemployment \ncompensation, against any kind of increase in the minimum wage.\n  There are 7 million Americans who would benefit from an increase in \nthe\n\n[[Page S974]]\n\nminimum wage, and this is what has happened:\n  More than half of the unemployed adults have had to postpone medical \ntreatment--that is 57 percent--or cut back on spending for food. That \nis happening in America. They had to postpone important medical \ntreatment or cut back on food. One in four has had to move to other \nhousing. We are talking about workers who have worked hard, played by \nthe rules, struggled for their families, and this is our answer to \nthem: Let's do a parliamentary trick so you can't have a vote on \nextending unemployment compensation. That is the answer of the other \nside. We are not even going to give you a vote on the issue.\n  This is what is happening to fellow Americans: 38 percent have lost \ntelephone service; 22 percent are worried they will lose their money; \nmore than a third have trouble paying gas or electric bills. These are \nreal problems. The list goes on.\n  What is the impact? We have been talking about dollars and cents, but \nwe haven't talked about the quality of life of these workers and what \nthey go through: 77 percent of unemployed Americans say the level of \nstress in their family has increased. That is understandable. We don't \nthink about it. I don't know how you put a dollar figure on that.\n\n  Two-thirds of those with children have cut back on spending on their \nchildren. This is an issue not only for workers, it is an issue for \ntheir children as well. It is a children's issue. It is a family issue. \nWe heard a great deal on the other side about family issues, family \nvalues. We have one right here on unemployment compensation. This is a \nchildren's issue, a family issue.\n  Twenty-six percent say another family member had to start a job or \nincrease hours; 23 percent had to interrupt their education. That is \nnice, isn't it? The children of these workers had to drop out of school \nbecause a member of their family--their father or mother--has been laid \noff and cannot get the resources to go to school.\n  We hear a good deal from the other side: Senator Kennedy, you don't \njust understand. We have a recovery. It is on the way. It is taking \nplace today. You just don't understand it. These problems will all be \nresolved. Right? Wrong.\n  Look at this chart. The Bush economy corporate profits ballooned \ncompared to workers' wages. Look in the early 1990s--this chart is \n1993--when we were recovering. When we had the recovery, workers' wages \nrepresented 60 percent of the economic expansion during this time. The \npercent that went to corporate profits was 39.74 percent; 60 percent \nfor wages, 39 percent for corporate profits.\n  We all heard at the time of the President's State of the Union \nAddress those descriptions about how the economy was doing so well, \nprofits were up, expanding the American economy. Look at today's \nrecovery: 87 percent in profits, 13 percent in wages.\n  I don't know how many other indicators we need to understand what is \nhappening to workers in America. They are hurting, and hurting badly. \nMany of them need the kind of help that unemployment compensation \nprovides.\n  At other times, with different administrations, with a Democratic \nadministration, we were prepared, particularly when the fund was in \nsurplus and particularly when these workers have paid into the fund--we \nwere willing to extend that unemployment compensation. There have been \n11 times in the last few weeks that Members of this body on this side \nof the aisle have requested we have an extension of unemployment \ncompensation. The House of Representatives voted for it, including 39 \nRepublicans. But this Republican leadership says: No, no way; fill up \nthe tree; get all kinds of procedural blocks to make sure we don't even \nbring it up and we don't have a vote.\n  American workers ought to understand this point. That is against the \nbackground of the leading economic advisers explaining to the President \nof the United States that we are better off if we ship more jobs \noverseas. And this institution, that should be debating national \npolicy, is being shut down by those who don't want to hear the debate \nand don't want accountability. That is a great mistake. It is a \nmistake, most of all, for our workers and their families, it is a \nmistake for our economy, and it is a mistake for our country.\n  I join with others who will say these issues are not going away. You \nmay be able to get a little block here and a little block there, but we \nare going to bring these issues up time and again.\n  We have that responsibility to these workers and their families, and \nthey should recognize that we are not going to retreat; we are not \ngoing to step back. We are going to do everything that is necessary to \nmake sure we are going to get the economic justice these workers \ndeserve.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Talent). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n        Independent Commission to Investigate Iraq Intelligence\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I was relieved that the President decided he \nwas going to appoint an independent panel to review what took place in \nour going to Iraq, but after he made the decision to do that and \nappointed the panel, it was obvious it was just a hoax. This panel is \nlaughable--if it were not so serious. All one needs to do to understand \nhow this panel is not serious is to look at who is the cochair of this \npanel. One of the most partisan people in all America is a man by the \nname of Judge Silberman. Judge Silberman is a person who proudly wears \nthe label of a partisan, even though he hides it as often as he can \nfrom the public.\n  As I said, I was glad President Bush realized we needed a commission \nto investigate what went wrong, although I would have preferred that \nCongress appoint members to ensure its independence. If this commission \nis going to do its job, it must be free of political influence. It must \nbe above even the appearance of partisan bias. Throw those things out \nthe window because there is not only the appearance of partisan bias, \nthere is political and partisan bias because the cochair of this \ncommission is a man by the name of Laurence Silberman.\n  He is a long-time political operative in the far right of the \nRepublican Party. He has served in a number of different capacities \nover the years. He has been involved in many partisan matters over the \nyears. To show how well reasoned and thinking people feel about this \nman, I quote a professor of law at American University by the name of \nHerman Schwartz:\n\n       He [Laurence Silberman] is fiercely partisan, pugnacious \n     and very political. He is an odd choice for a panel that is \n     supposed to be above suspicion on a matter that is very \n     important and potentially very partisan. Picking Silberman \n     verges on the brazen. It is a thumb in the eye to those who \n     were looking for a real investigation.\n\n  That is who we have as cochair of this independent commission, a man \nwho is politically partisan and the appointment is brazen. As I \nindicated, he is a long-time political operative, far right of the \nRepublican Party. He served in many capacities. He was an aide in the \nReagan-Bush campaign. One of his assignments then was to serve as \nliaison to the Islamic regime in Iran where Americans were being held \nhostage. There is some question as to whether a deal was made that the \ncrisis would not end until after the election. One can read lots of \ninformation about that, but as soon as the election was over and the \nhostages were released, it is interesting to note that Laurence \nSilberman was appointed by the President to the Court of Appeals in \nWashington, DC.\n  It speaks volumes to indicate that one of his early decisions came in \nthe case of LTC Oliver North, a principal figure in the Iran-contra \naffair, which involved the release of Iranian hostages. There is the \ndocumentation of many meetings of Silberman with the people in the \nWhite House, including Colonel North, prior to this all taking place. \nEven though North and Admiral Poindexter were convicted of lying to \nCongress, their convictions were voided in 1990 by Judge Silberman.\n  It is also interesting to note that another one of the appointees \nthere on that court, who joined with Silberman in overruling the North \nand Poindexter\n\n[[Page S975]]\n\nconvictions, Mr. Sentelle, who became a judge, was largely responsible \nfor the 1994 decision to remove Whitewater prosecutor Robert Fiske and \nreplace him with the more partisan Kenneth Starr as an independent \ninvestigator. We know that investigation cost $60 million or $80 \nmillion and accomplished nothing.\n  Silberman worked as an attorney in the Justice Department. He took \nthe No. 2 job under President Ford when Rumsfeld and Cheney had top \njobs in the White House of President Ford. I repeat, in the fall of \n1980 when Ronald Reagan was running to unseat President Carter--and \nthis is from the L.A. Times, a direct quote:\n\n       . . . Silberman and two other Reagan advisors met secretly \n     with a man who claimed to have ties to the government in \n     Iran, which is holding 52 American hostages. The brief \n     meeting later led to unproven allegations that Reagan's aides \n     sought to delay the release of the hostages until after the \n     November election.\n\n  Well, it is interesting to note that he had not done enough, it \nappears. In 1987, when Reagan was under investigation by an independent \ncounsel, Silberman did away with the Independent Counsel Act, saying it \nwas unconstitutional. Of course that one was followed up on by the \nSupreme Court, which overwhelmingly reversed him just a month later. \nBut Silberman had the last word. His opinion, joined by fellow Reagan \nappointee David Sentelle, voided North's conviction and also spared \nReagan's National Security Adviser, John Poindexter.\n  During the Clinton years, Silberman was one of President Clinton's \nmost aggressive tormentors. In 1998, he was part of a Federal appellate \npanel that rejected the administration's claim of executive privilege \nto block the Secret Service from testifying about Clinton's \nrelationship with former White House worker Monica Lewinsky. \nSilberman's opinion, to say the least, was very political. He ripped \nthe Attorney General for acting in the personal interest of President \nClinton and questioned whether the President, by allowing aides to \ncriticize independent counsel Kenneth Starr, was ``declaring war on the \nUnited States.'' Not very judicious, I would think.\n  There was a book that was a best seller called ``Blinded by the \nRight,'' written by David Brock. It is a very interesting book. It \ntalks about how this young man, who was a student at one of the \nuniversities of California, decided to join with the far right, and he \nmade it through even working for the Washington Times. In his book, he \nexplains how that was an interesting experience and how unfair they \nwere in almost everything they wrote. But David Brock, during his \ntenure as a spokesperson for the right, and writing all these very \ndamaging, misleading articles and even books, said in the book, \n``Blinded by the Right,'' that his adviser, the person who directed him \nwhere to go, what to say, and even went through books and articles he \nhad written to proofread them to see if he could be more hard-hitting \nthan Brock was, this is the man who is going to be the cochairman of \nthe independent commission. The term ``independent commission,'' used \nalong with Laurence Silberman, is like many of the things in George \nOrwell's book, ``1984.'' Many of the things are just the opposite. \nLaurence Silberman cannot be independent. The commission cannot be \nindependent as long as he is there.\n\n  As Brock indicated, he wrote articles about President Clinton, an \narticle on Travelgate, which was charges by Arkansas State Troopers \nabout the former Governor Clinton and extramarital sex. Silberman was, \nand I quote, ``his faithful advisor.''\n  ``The judge,'' according to the LA Times, Brock said, ``encouraged \nhim to be aggressive, and even on one occasion, suggested a specific \ntip involving the President's sex life to pursue.''\n  When David Brock, at the direction of many in the right wing, wrote \ncritically about the late Senator Paul Simon, he sent an advance copy \nto Judge Silberman's home. Brock wrote that Silberman was ``ecstatic \nabout the case he made against Simon. . . .''\n  During this period of time, Brock said he was introduced to leading \nconservatives who met regularly in the judge's home even with him and \nhis wife. They were friends and close companions of Vice President \nCheney and his wife.\n  Mr. President, people have a right to be as partisan as they choose \nbut not if you are a judge. Judges not only have to do away with what \nis wrong, but with what appears to be wrong. Just with the little bit I \nset forth here, doesn't it seem wrong that this man, Laurence \nSilberman, is the cochairman of a bipartisan, independent commission \nwhen it has been acknowledged by most everyone that this is one of the \nmost partisan people in our community? An American University law \nschool professor says:\n\n       He is fiercely partisan, pugnacious and very political. . . \n     . He is an odd choice for a panel that is supposed to be \n     above suspicion on a matter that is very important and \n     potentially very partisan. Picking Silberman verges on the \n     brazen.\n\n  I agree with that, the ``brazen.'' Let's see if that means what I \nthink it means, ``brazen.'' I have a little dictionary here. Let's see \nwhat it says.\n\n       Brazen: Boldness.\n\n  Yes, he is pretty bold.\n  For the President to pick this man to be cochairman of this \ncommission is, as Professor Schwartz says, ``brazen.'' I continue the \nquote.\n\n       It's a thumb in the eye to those who were looking for a \n     real investigation.\n\n  This is no real investigation. This is going to be Judge Silberman, \nin an aggressive way, making sure that nothing gets out of hand. He is \nthere to protect the President, not to get fair information. He is \nthere to protect him.\n  Sitting judges are not supposed to do what Silberman does. But he has \na lifetime appointment and the canons of judicial ethics mean nothing \nto him. He is bold, he is brazen in what he does. He does not hide his \npartisanship. But, in spite of that this administration, knowing \neverything there is to know about this man, selects him to be the \ncochair of this independent commission.\n\n  Brock says, in his book: ``Larry''--that is Laurence Silberman--\n``would often preface his remarks to me with the wry demurrer that \njudges shouldn't get involved in politics. `That would be improper,' \nhe'd say--and then he'd go ahead . . .'' and give this information that \nwas partisan and, even, according to Silberman, would be improper. But \nhe would just go ahead and do it anyway.\n  Most recently, to show his partisanship, after a lower court \nunanimously ruled that Attorney General John Ashcroft had exceeded his \nauthority in assuming broad wiretap powers, Silberman was the judge \ninvolved in the decision that overturned it. By engaging in partisan \nactivities while he was a sitting judge, Silberman has raised questions \nabout his impartiality, and that is an understatement.\n  So I hope we continue to talk about the need for an independent, \nbipartisan commission because as long as Laurence Silberman is attached \nto this commission, it will be tainted. This crucial investigation as \nto what went wrong with our intelligence operations cannot be tainted \nwith any hint of bias or prejudice--and it is. It is not tainted, it is \nsmeared with partisan prejudice because of this man.\n  There is already a distrust of the intelligence gathering surrounding \nweapons of mass destruction. The Silberman appointment only makes \nmatters worse.\n  I call upon the President to replace Judge Silberman on this \ncommission. There are many respected Republicans in public service who \nhave demonstrated an ability to put their ideological and partisan \nviews aside when it comes to what affects our Nation. Silberman cannot \nmeet that. This is such an issue and demands such a person. Laurence \nSilberman is not such a person.\n  To show how skeptical the country is about our intelligence-gathering \noperations, even Bill O'Reilly--even Bill O'Reilly, reports Reuters \nNews:\n\n       Conservative television news anchor Bill O'Reilly said on \n     Tuesday he was now skeptical about the Bush administration \n     and apologized to viewers for supporting prewar claims that \n     Iraq had weapons of mass destruction.\n       The anchor of his own show on Fox News said--\n\n  This is Bill O'Reilly--\n\n     he was sorry he gave the U.S. government the benefit of the \n     doubt that former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's weapons \n     program posed an imminent threat, the main reason cited for \n     going to war.\n\n  Appearing on TV, O'Reilly said:\n\n       I was wrong. I am not pleased about it at all, and I think \n     all Americans should be concerned about this.\n\n\n[[Page S976]]\n\n\n  We have a committee, a commission appointed by the President, in the \nguise of being independent, in the guise of being bipartisan. It simply \nis not true. As long as Laurence Silberman has anything to do with \nthis, it cannot be a fair, independent, bipartisan commission.\n  The scope of this so-called independent commission was determined by \nthe President through Executive order. There was no discussion with the \nlegislative branch of Government; it was just a fiat. Despite the fact \nthat numerous questions have been raised about the actions or \nstatements of both the intelligence and communications community in the \ndays before the war, the President's Executive order specifically rules \nout an examination of the administration's actions.\n  Can you believe that? Instead, his Executive order makes clear the \nonly issues the commission can address are related to the performance \nof the intelligence community, precisely the same issues, in many \ncases, that the Republican-controlled intelligence committees in the \nHouse and Senate are already exploring. Unfortunately, this will not be \na real commission that can answer the main question we believe needs to \nbe addressed; namely, the administration's role in all of this.\n  On top of all this, they have appointed Laurence Silberman to \ncochair. This is a gross mistake. I can't imagine how the President and \nhis people think he can get away with this.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from Nevada will \nyield? I wonder if he would yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield to my friend. He and I have had \ndiscussions. I would just preface it for this----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is not \nrecognized. The Senator from Nevada yields for a question.\n  Mr. REID. I would say through the Chair, the Senator and I have \ndiscussed this on many occasions off the Senate floor.\n  Both agree that this issue has to be talked about publicly.\n  This is a disgrace to a determined, independent, bipartisan \ncommission. It is just wrong.\n  I would be happy to yield to my friend from North Dakota for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have visited the Senator from Nevada and \nothers following the announcement of the cochairs of this commission.\n  First of all, I believe there should be an independent commission. I \nbelieve very strongly that the question of intelligence--both the \ngathering of and use of intelligence--is critically important to this \ncountry because it, and only it, will provide protection for this \ncountry against the next terrorist attacks. We have to get it right.\n  When Mr. Kay comes before a committee and says it was all wrong, it \nwas wrong and it failed the President--it also failed the Congress and \nthe American people--we had better figure out what happened, what was \nwrong. There needs to be a commission. But it needs to be an \nindependent commission.\n  Now what we have is the President announcing a commission to \ninvestigate the intelligence. But more than that, the point the Senator \nfrom Nevada just made about the cochair, Mr. Laurence Silberman, a \njudge--I read this book from a while ago, ``Blinded By the Right.'' I \nwas aware when I read this book by David Brock of Mr. Silberman's \nactivities in other venues as well.\n  I must tell you that having read this book and seen that a sitting \nFederal judge was involved in the sort of things Mr. Brock says he was \ninvolved in with respect to a series of things that it seems to me \nwould go well beyond what would be acceptable activities by a Federal \njudge, I think it is just Byzantine that the President would appoint a \ncochair to this commission who doesn't meet the test of objectivity or \nthe test of common sense at all. There can be nothing independent about \na commission that is cochaired by a sitting Federal judge whose \ndiscussions and activities in this book disclose that there is nothing \nat all impartial about this judge.\n  I will not read into the Record these passages. I assume perhaps the \nSenator from Nevada has. I know many of my colleagues are talking about \nthe same thing.\n  I ask the Senator from Nevada: Can there be a presumption of \nimpartiality by a cochair of this commission, appointed by the \nPresident to investigate this issue of the executive branch--by the \nway, without subpoena power or anything of the sort--when the President \nhas chosen a very strident, aggressive, partisan supporter as the \ncochair?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I do not understand how the President and \nthe people around him could do this. Do what? Have a commission with an \noutline that is very weak and won't contribute very much to find out \nwhat our intelligence community did or did not do. But maybe he could \nget by with it a little better by not having a person who has been \nproven to be one of the most partisan people in all of America as \ncochair of this commission. Here is a man who is violating the canons \nof judicial ethics and responsibilities that judges have. Yet he is on \nthis commission as cochair. I have trouble articulating how \nirresponsible and unfair and brazen this is.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, again, inquiring further of the Senator \nfrom Nevada, aside from the fact that this is not an independent \ncommission, it is not what is needed to be done at this point to \nevaluate and investigate the ``failures'' Mr. Kay described in our \nintelligence. This so-called commission cannot possibly be a commission \nheld in much respect if the selection as the cochair is a fierce \npartisan whose exploits are described at least in part in this book.\n\n  Incidentally, I think the question should rest with the judicial \nsystem, Why has this not been investigated? I know of no investigation \nin the judicial system with respect to what is alleged with respect to \nthe activity of Mr. Silberman.\n  This country needs an impartial, independent, aggressive \ninvestigation of what happened with respect to our intelligence.\n  As I indicated, our safety and security depend on intelligence \ngetting it right with respect to protecting us against the next \nterrorist attack. That is why this is so important.\n  I personally plan to support and aggressively speak in favor of a \ntruly independent commission. I am assuming one will be offered by \nperhaps Senator Corzine who has offered it on the floor of the Senate. \nWe will have this debate at some point. We need a commission. It needs \nto be independent. It needs to be cochaired by people who do not have a \npartisan agenda. That is simply not the case with the independent \ncommission that has been announced now by the President.\n  I ask the Senator from Nevada: Is that not the case?\n  Mr. REID. It is absolutely the case.\n  I also ask the Senator from North Dakota, through the Chair, to \nrespond to a statement by David Kay given to me yesterday. He said \nthere should be an examination of how the intelligence was used by the \nadministration--not simply the failings of the intelligence community.\n  Will the Senator agree that David Kay is right, there should be an \nexamination of how the intelligence was used by the administration--not \nsimply the failings of the intelligence community?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if I might respond, there is no question \nthat any evaluation of this should be an evaluation of what kind of \nintelligence existed and how it was used. That is not an attempt to put \nany one person under a microscope; it is an attempt to evaluate what \nhappened here. What on Earth happened?\n  Again, I say there are some who want to say nothing happened. They \nwant to allege nothing has happened. Clearly, something has happened.\n  The top weapons inspector came back to this country and said our \nintelligence community has failed the President, and in fact the \nintelligence community failed, and we now believe that to be the case. \nThe Secretary of State went to the United Nations and he said: We know, \nwe know, we know, on point after point after point, slide after slide, \nintelligence pictures, satellite photos, we know this, we know this, we \nknow this. It turns out we didn't know that.\n  This is important business. This country needs to act on what we \nknow--not what we think we know. If our intelligence community failed \nus,\n\n[[Page S977]]\n\nas Mr. Kay indicates it did, and he says failed the President--I say \nfailed all of us--then the question is, Why? How did that happen? How \nwas intelligence gathered? Where did that failure exist? And how was \nthat intelligence used? I believe only an independent commission will \nget to that answer. I think it is urgent that we get there.\n\n  As you know, in England they are now having such an investigation, \nwith an end date I believe of July. They understand the urgency. They \nare saying let us do it, and let us do it quickly but thoroughly.\n  In this case, we have a so-called independent commission, cochaired \nby a strident partisan, and at the same time we are told it is fine to \nhave that commission report sometime after next year. I just do not \nthink that is the right thing.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator yield for a parliamentary \ninquiry?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield for a parliamentary inquiry.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I have the floor. I will yield for a question.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I think we are in a highly charged political season right \nnow. Everyone is talking about this, and the subliminal picture that is \ntrying to be painted here is that somehow this President may have not \nknown something he should have known or knew something and he didn't \nact appropriately.\n  Let us remember what David Kay said. He said, when he came in, we all \nthought there were weapons of mass destruction. We acted accordingly. \nAnd, quite frankly, I contend there were weapons of mass destruction. I \nasked him that question. I don't think either one of the two Senators \nin the Chamber--I am about to finish my question--were at that hearing.\n  I asked him this question: I said, If in January, 13 months ago, they \nfound 11 chemical rockets with a capacity of a warhead of 140 liters, \nand they had enough VX on hand to do that, and that one chemical rocket \nwith 140 liters of VX could kill a million people, and subsequent to \nthat, 3 months later, they found 36 more--that is 47 weapons of mass \ndestruction that were found--I asked him: Aren't they truly weapons of \nmass destruction? He said: Well, yes, if they put the chemicals in the \nwarheads.\n  The other thing people keep talking about, What did they know or what \ndid they not know about a connection between Saddam Hussein and Osama \nbin Laden. That should have been put to rest about a month ago when \nthere was a leak to the Weekly Standard. They specifically drew that \nconnection and said, yes, in fact, there is a connection. In fact, two \nof the passports of the pilots were gotten by Saddam Hussein and his \npeople.\n  Just this morning in the New York Times there is an article stating \nthe connection is there. This is the New York Times, not a Republican \noperation. It says: ``Found, Smoking Gun.'' That is the name of this \narticle.\n  We are enjoying this very much, but the political season is on us. I \nhope we will keep cool heads and do the best we can to improve our \nintelligence.\n  Right after September 11 we had the bicameral commission look at \nthis. We came a long way. I ask the assistant leader if that is not \ncorrect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Before the Senator from Nevada responds, the \nChair feels constrained to remind all Senators, Senators may yield for \nquestions but not for speeches.\n  The Senator from Nevada has the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Oklahoma says this \nis political season. We are in the Senate. Every day of our life is \npolitical season. That is what we do. That is what we do for the \nAmerican people. That is what we do for the people of the State of \nNevada, the people of Oklahoma, the people of North Dakota, and the \npeople of Missouri.\n  I agree with my friend's statement, there is no showing of weapons of \nmass destruction. True. The point is, this is serious business. This is \nnot trying to determine what happened at half time at the Super Bowl. \nThis is looking at the situation involving the security of this Nation \nand actually the security of this world. We should have an independent \ncommission, bipartisan in nature. Everyone agrees with that.\n  I personally do not like the parameters of what the President set \nforth. It does not establish what needs to be done. But the purpose of \nthis discussion today with Senator Dorgan and this Senator from Nevada \nis the commission, as set up as an independent bipartisan commission, \nis tainted. As I indicated earlier, it is not only tainted, it is \nsmeared. Why? Because the President chose as the cochair of this \ncommission a man who is one of the most partisan zealots in the history \nof this country. So this commission can never render anything of \nsubstance that will be accepted in this country because of this man \nbeing the cochair. I suggest, get him off. If he had any care about \nthis country, he would resign.\n  The Senator from North Dakota hit the nail on the head: Where is our \njudicial system? There could be hearings and proof established, for \nexample, that David Brock went into this man's home, time after time \nafter time while he was sitting on important cases. What was Brock \ndoing--getting advice as to how he could berate, denigrate, lie, cheat \nabout the President of the United States?\n  These are facts.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me respond briefly to my friend from Oklahoma, and I \nwill phrase it in the form of a question to the Senator from Nevada. \nThere is no question the world is better off because Saddam Hussein was \nfound in a rat hole and no longer runs the country of Iraq. The world \nwould be better off if Kim Jong Il were not running the country of \nKorea. That is not the issue. An interesting point, but not the issue.\n\n  The issue is, the top weapons inspector says that which we said we \nknew, which we told the world we knew, was not the case. Why? Because \nhe said our intelligence system failed.\n  No one here should sleep quite as soundly as they used to sleep, \nunderstanding that our intelligence system failed.\n  We all ought to demand on an urgent basis to understand what happened \nand how it happened. That is the point the Senator from Nevada and I \nare making. I hope the Senator from Oklahoma believes in the urgency of \nthis, as well.\n  I ask the Senator from Nevada if it is not the case that the question \nby the Senator from Oklahoma about the September 11 commission moving \nin the right direction, is it not the case that yesterday we saw this \nheadline: ``9/11 Panel Threatens to Issue Subpoenas for Bush's \nBriefings''? In fact, they have already had to issue subpoenas. This \ncommission investigating the September 11 attacks had to issue \nsubpoenas against the FAA and others and is now threatening to issues \nsubpoenas against the White House and said this morning they had more \ncooperation.\n  Is it not the case that any administration, Democrat or Republican, \nought to say to this commission and any commission: Here are our \nrecords. They are open. We want you to get to the bottom of this.\n  Mr. REID. I say through the floor to my friend from North Dakota, the \nSenator makes the point. The other body which is doing the \ninvestigation, no one raises any question about the Members of that \ncommission. They are Democrats and they are Republicans. Very \nconservative Congressman Tim Roemer is part of that. But no one \nquestions what they are trying to do to get to the facts of this \nmatter.\n  My point is, and the point of the Senator from North Carolina is, \nthis so-called bipartisan independent commission can never render \nanything the American public will accept because of the person that is \ncochairing it. Laurence Silberman is a partisan zealot.\n  Now the New York Times article the Senator pointed out is a group of \npeople, including Tim Roemer, and Governor Kean of New Jersey. No one \nquestions his integrity. He believes we should move forward and get \nthis done as soon as possible.\n  I repeat, the independent commission President Bush has appointed to \nlook at the failure of intelligence in our country will never, ever be \naccepted for a number of reasons, not only the breadth and scope of the \ninvestigation but because of the cochair, Laurence Silberman.\n\n[[Page S978]]\n\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, let me reiterate how important this bill \nis to our country's infrastructure and our country's economy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. This bill will provide desperately needed funds to \nrebuild decaying roads and bridges and to improve transit systems \nacross the country. It will pump billions of dollars into real, lasting \nimprovements in physical infrastructure.\n  In the process it will provide new, quality jobs for hundreds of \nthousands of people. These are jobs that cannot be outsourced. I \nrepeat--these are jobs that cannot be outsourced.\n  The President says that this bill is too expensive. He also \napparently believes that outsourcing American jobs is a good thing. He \nis wrong on both counts.\n  If we can spend billions rebuilding Iraq's physical infrastructure, \nsurely we can find the money to maintain America's transportation \ninfrastructure. Without well-maintained roads, bridges, and transit \nsystems, our economy will inevitably suffer.\n  Let's keep the big picture in view here. This bill spends money to \npay Americans for work done in this country. This work translates \ndirectly into improved roads, bridges, and transit systems. Better \ninfrastructure reduces transaction costs and makes the economy more \nefficient. This is an economic fact.\n  This bill also reduces congestion on our Nation's roadways by \nenhancing public transportation and promoting intermodal solutions to \nregional transportation problems.\n  As we all know, less congestion means shorter commute times. Shorter \ncommute times means more time for productive activity. This too is an \neconomic fact.\n  But this bill goes far beyond simply improving the infrastructure in \nthis country. It also enhances our ability to move goods across our \nborders in trade with Canada and Mexico. By enhancing freight capacity \nand improving binational transportation planning efforts, the bill \nreduces the transactions costs associated with cross-border trade.\n  That means that American consumers will pay lower prices for imports \nfrom Canada and Mexico. It also means that our exports will be less \nexpensive for Canadian and Mexican consumers, and that's good for \nAmerican manufacturers. This too is an economic fact.\n  Finally, as several of my colleagues have noted, this bill will also \nenhance safety on our Nation's highways. With improved safety we can \nreduce injuries and loss of life from highway accidents. That's \nobviously good for the American people in a deeply personal sense. It \nis also good for the country as a whole because it reduces the social \ncosts associated with injury and loss of life.\n  Our country needs this bill and it needs it now. I urge my colleagues \nto help pass this bill before the Senate concludes its business this \nweek.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, yesterday when we were discussing the \nseatbelt law, quite frankly, I was opposed to it. I am opposed to any \nkind of mandate. I cannot find anyone in this body who has either been \na former Governor or mayor of a major city that won't oppose mandates. \nOf course, that would have been a great one, with three penalties. That \nis behind us now.\n  During that time, the assistant minority leader had a suggestion that \nwe might want to consider what they have done in Nevada. They had this \nrequirement just for the babies and small children, which was \ninteresting. I commented that I am very familiar with that, having 11 \ngrandchildren. I know all about the seatbelts and all these little \nrequirements they have and how expensive they are. In an attempt to \noutdo me, as sometimes happens on the floor of the Senate, the Senator \nfrom Nevada commented that, yes, you have 11 grandchildren, but I have \n14. I got a phone call after that and found out that I in fact have 12 \nnow. So I want to get the record straight that we are still working on \nit and we are going to catch the Senator from Nevada. A new Swan will \nbe born; that happens to be my daughter's name.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will yield, I say to my friend that under \nthe rules the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma has established, he \nis counting those children who are in gestation and not having been \nborn. If that is the case, I can still up him one. I will have 15 \nbecause we have a new baby who will be born a month from now. So I am \nstill two ahead of him.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Reclaiming my time, I observe we are both still working \non that, and when they are conceived they are babies.\n  Mr. TALENT. Will the Senator yield? I hope the Senator's child and \nin-law have already announced this expected occasion and you have not \nrevealed it to the Senate and the world.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I did get that permission. I made that mistake once. I \nwas commenting back when a little boy was born to my older son and his \nwife. My older son is James Mountain Inhofe II. He kept having baby \ngirls. The years went by and they kept cranking the girls out. I always \nwanted to have a boy, selfishly, James Mountain Inhofe III. So we found \nout--and this happened a couple years ago--that in fact my daughter-in-\nlaw was unexpectedly pregnant--Jimmy's wife. I respond to the Senator \nthat what we did is for 8 months we prayed every day it would be a boy. \nI figured if Abraham could do it, I could do it. Sure enough, we were \nup in the waiting room and the nurse came in while I was doing a 30-\nminute talk show with Ollie North. Right in the middle of that, she \ncame in and said, ``Senator, how did you know? You are the only one who \nknew it was going to be a boy.'' I said, ``Ollie, James Mountain Inhofe \nIII has been born.'' On the way back it occurred to me they had not yet \nnamed that child, and I announced the name on the radio. So I learned \nthat lesson.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The Senator from Missouri is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I am sure sons and daughters-in-law have \nbeen forgiving proud grandparents of a lot worse things than that. I \ncongratulate the Senator from Oklahoma and the Senator from Nevada on \nthe additions to their families.\n  We are really talking about a subject today that is important to all \nof our families. That is why we are here. That is why those who have \nworked so hard for transportation, including my friend from Oklahoma, \nhave done what they have done. I am here to rise in support of the \nbill, and also in support of an amendment I am now offering at this \ntime with my friend from Oregon, Mr. Wyden, and also on behalf of Mr. \nCorzine and Mr. Coleman.\n  This is an amendment that has broad support within the community of \nthose who are particularly interested in transportation, including the \nsupport of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation \nOfficials, Associated General Contractors of America, Chamber of \nCommerce, National Heavy and Highway Alliance, which represents the \nlabor unions, operating engineers, carpenters union, iron workers \nunion, cement masons, the teamsters, and bricklayers, and many others. \nWe call it the Build America Bond Act of 2003.\n  We think it is one of the most important things we can do on behalf \nof the Nation's transportation infrastructure. I am here to explain the \namendment and the idea and argue on behalf of it.\n  First, however, I want to say thank you to my friend from Oklahoma, \nSenator Bond, Senator Reid, and Senator Jeffords for their efforts on \nbehalf of the underlying bill. Those efforts have been heroic. They \nhave done a great job to get the level of spending in the bill up to \nwhere they got it. I am going to\n\n[[Page S979]]\n\nmake the point in a couple minutes that it needs to be a lot higher \nthan that. In making that point, I don't wish to be understood as \ncriticizing them for their work. They have done the best they can do \nwith the traditional methods of funding.\n  I would also like, before I begin discussing the amendment, to thank \nmy friend from Oregon, who may or may not make it to the floor this \nafternoon to talk about this amendment. I know he wants to. We have had \nthe pleasure of working together for almost a year now on the Build \nAmerica Bond Act. For me, it has been a personal as well as \nprofessional pleasure to renew an acquaintance and working relationship \nwe had together in the House during our years when we were there \ntogether.\n  I thank our friends who are handling this bill, especially my senior \nSenator, Kit Bond, for his great work on behalf of the underlying bill. \nI am pleased they have gotten the measure to where it is right now. Yet \nI have to tell the Senate the measure is not big enough. I say that \nbecause it bothers me when critics of this bill say it spends too much. \nThe truth is it does not invest enough. It bothers me when critics of \nthe bill say spending on transportation infrastructure is \nirresponsible, when actually the opposite is the truth. Not spending \nenough on transportation infrastructure is what is irresponsible, \nbecause we have a transportation deficit in this country. It is growing \nevery day we fail to take the necessary steps in the Congress.\n  The Department of Transportation studied the Nation's highways, \nbridges, and transit systems, and reported back to Congress. They filed \na long report and concluded we needed a highway bill that was about \n$375 billion. This is the report of the expert agencies on behalf of \nthe Federal Government. It says $375 billion, not $311 billion. I am \nglad we got it to that point, but it will not take $311 billion, not \n$300 billion, not $280 billion, not $250 billion, but $375 billion--or \nsomething close to it--if we are going to begin paying back the \ntransportation deficit we have.\n  I don't believe what I am saying about the status of our Nation's \ntransportation system is seriously contested by anybody. A lot of \npeople don't want to remedy it and pay what we need to pay to do \nsomething about it, but they are not contesting that there is a serious \nproblem.\n  Thirty-two percent of the Nation's roads are poor or mediocre; 36 \npercent of our urban roads are poor; 37 percent of our bridges are \nobsolete. We lose $67 billion a year in wasted time and wasted fuel \ncosts because of congestion caused by inadequate roads. We lose 4.5 \nbillion man-hours from people around this country who are stuck in \ntraffic. Those are hours they are not at the office or the factory \nproducing things. Those are hours they are not at home with their \nfamilies.\n  We spend $49 billion a year on extra vehicle repair costs because \nmaintenance costs are higher than they should be because the roads are \nno good. Those are the overall statistics. And everybody has their own \nanecdotal stories about the shocks they had to replace because of the \npotholes, the time they lose getting to work in the morning.\n  There are so many examples of poor infrastructure that my friend \nSenator Bond and I could give. I called back to Missouri and asked for \na picture of the bridge over the Missouri River leading into Hermann, \nMO. Don Kruse, who is the editor of the Advertiser-Courier in Hermann, \ndid me a favor and went out and took a picture of it. This is a bridge \nnot over some small river or not over the Missouri River where the \nriver begins where it is narrow. This is over the Missouri River in \neast central Missouri. This is the bridge you take to get into Hermann, \nMO, which, by the way, is a great town. It is a bustling town, a town \nwith a future if we can get the proper infrastructure.\n  I don't know if most Members of the Senate can see this picture or if \nthe people in the Galleries can see it that well, but the rails are \nrusted. We can see how narrow the bridge is. That is a Mack truck \ncoming one way, and that is a car trying to go the other way. You don't \nhave to be a transportation expert, you don't have to work for the \nDepartment of Transportation to say: I don't think that bridge is \nadequate. It isn't.\n  You have to either laugh or cry over it. When I drive over it, I say: \nWe ought to tell Hollywood if they ever want a crumbling bridge or a \npoor bridge to use in a movie, they don't have to build one; come here \nand use this one outside Hermann.\n  We have blood alleys all over Missouri. I have driven on them--roads \nthat are so dangerous people regularly die because the roads are no \ngood. We also have interchanges in our growing communities, such as \nSpringfield, the I-44 and I-64 interchange that are inadequate.\n  There are many opportunities around Missouri for economic growth of \nwhich we cannot avail ourselves because the transportation system isn't \nwhat it should be.\n  North Missouri has been in economic trouble for a long time, long \nbefore the existing recession. It is not because of the people there. \nThey are productive people with a vision. A big part of the reason is \nthe roads are not good enough.\n  If we could turn Highway 36 in north Missouri into a four-lane road, \nit would link up Hannibal to St. Joseph, which links up Chicago to \nKansas City, and the jobs would follow that corridor. We don't have the \nmoney.\n  There are too many first-tier, urgent projects in the State of \nMissouri and in States all over this country that are not being done, \nnot because they shouldn't have a priority, but because there isn't \nenough money. So they get pushed further and further behind, and we are \nall familiar with that situation.\n  We are all familiar with the departments of transportation saying: We \nare going to do that; we are going to widen that road; we are going to \ndo the system maintenance; it is on the books for 2020. Everybody in \nthe communities knows what that means. It is never going to be done.\n  If that isn't enough--and it should be enough--in Missouri, we lost \n1,028 people to highway fatalities in 2002 alone. The statistics show \nthat one out of three accidents are related to the fact that the roads \nare no good.\n  When you travel around Missouri, one of the things you notice--and I \nwonder if they have this in other States. I should ask some of my \ncolleagues; I never have. But the highway department allows people, \ngrieving families to put little white crosses on the side of the road \nwhere they lost a loved one, and they will write the names of those \nloved ones on the crosses, sometimes the age. You might see ``Jennifer, \nage 7'' as you whiz by and see that little white cross.\n  Every one of those people who died on one of those roads has a family \nwho loved them. Tell those families that this highway bill is too big. \nTell them we don't need to spend more on transportation infrastructure. \nTell them that.\n  What can we do about it? We can do something. We have a mechanism \navailable that is used in States and localities all over this country, \na mechanism that will produce dollars immediately to help us remedy \nthis transportation deficit. We can do it responsibly. It has the \nsupport of groups involved in transportation from all over the country. \nIt is bonding, and that is why the Senator from Oregon and I in the \nspring of last year sponsored the Build America Bonds Act.\n\n  We argue that it is the only way we can address this issue quickly, \nin combination, of course, with the traditional methods of funding that \nwe also support. This is a way to jump-start this effort. This is a way \nto make up for this deficit in transportation, for this work that we \nshould have done in the past and did not.\n  Basically, the amendment, if and when we get a chance to offer it, \nwould create a federally chartered nonprofit corporation that would \nraise $56 billion in tax credit bonds that could be immediately \ninvested in transportation infrastructure. According to our amendment, \n$40 billion could go to highways, $10 billion to public transit, and $6 \nbillion to rail. It could be invested right away, not even over the \nlife of the bill, the 6 years, but as fast as we can raise it and get \nit out to the States, and the work could be done in the course of the \nnext year or two.\n  It is a great job creator. Every billion dollars in transportation \ninvestment creates about 47,000 jobs. Build America Bonds have the \npotential to create over 2 million jobs. It is one of the reasons the \ntrade unions are so strongly in support of it, because their members\n\n[[Page S980]]\n\nhave to drive on these roads and use this transportation system, too. \nOur amendment also has the potential to generate over $300 million in \neconomic activity.\n  There is a feature to it that my friend from Oregon and I \nparticularly like. The amendment would require that a percentage of the \nbonds be issued in small denominations, $25, $50, so that moms and dads \nand grandmas and grandpas could go out and buy a Build America bond and \ngive it to their kids or their grandkids for their birthdays and know \nthat they were investing their moneys in American roads and creating \nAmerican jobs and protecting the future of their kids as they grow up \nin this country.\n  The bill has the potential to save us up to $67 billion that we now \nspend or waste in traffic congestion and the $50 billion spent in extra \nvehicle repair.\n  This kind of financing is done all over this country. The funny thing \nis, there is a certain irony to it. This Government will borrow--and \neverybody here is going to vote for this highway bill or has voted for \none at one time or another--hundreds of billions of dollars in long-\nterm debt to pay for operating expenses. Nobody else in the country \ndoes that. Yet unless this amendment passes, we will not borrow money \nfor long-term capital expenses, which routinely happens all over the \ncountry in public and private life. We will not borrow the money for \nthe items we should finance--investments in capital goods that pay off \nover time.\n  What is the cost? The way we have set this mechanism up and given the \ninternational bond markets and their sophistication, we estimate that \nunder current market conditions, the total cost to the taxpayers would \nbe $2.5 billion a year, for 30-year bonds. It would be $2.5 billion a \nyear. For that we get about 2 million jobs. We actually get this bill \nup to the level which the Department of Transportation says we need to \nreally begin remedying this transportation deficit. It is, quite \nsimply, the cheapest way of addressing the problem.\n  What is the most expensive way?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, will the distinguished Senator from \nMissouri yield for a question?\n  Mr. TALENT. I will be happy to yield to my friend.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I so appreciate the Senator's leadership on \nthis issue and opportunity to be a bipartisan partner in this effort. \nIsn't it fair to say the Federal Government is now essentially the only \nentity on the planet that isn't going with the kind of approach that \nthe Senator from Missouri has been advocating? It is being done at the \nState level, it is being done at the local level, and it is being done \nthrough various private initiatives.\n  It seems to me what the Senator has identified is essentially a case \nfor saying the Federal Government ought to join the rest of the world \nin its approach to this logical way. Would the distinguished sponsor of \nthis amendment, my partner, address that briefly?\n  Mr. TALENT. I thank the Senator for his question. He is absolutely \ncorrect. I have been to ribbon cuttings and ceremonies in Missouri, and \nI bet the Senator has been to them in Oregon, where localities have \nfinanced local bond issues in order to do transportation \ninfrastructure, because there is not enough money coming from the State \nand Federal Government. States also do this.\n  The Senator and I are not talking about shifting over to bonding as a \nway of replacing other highway dollars, or taking over the job of \nfinancing transportation, because we do not want that. But bonding \nshould be part of a package that will give us the ability to do the big \nprojects, the one-time projects. We are not suggesting the States \nshould build this into their regular maintenance budgets because this \nmoney is going to come in and is going to be invested. It is not a \nregular stream. It is part of an overall financing package absolutely, \nand it is done all over this country. Given the deficit transportation \nsituation we are in, the fact that we have this terrible problem with \ntransportation, I think it is foolish of us not to consider it.\n  It is one of the reasons I have appreciated so much working with my \nfriend. I say to my friend, through the Chair, what is the most \nexpensive way of dealing with this? If we were looking for the most \nexpensive and risky way to pay for the transportation problem we have \nto fix the roads, rail, and transit that we need in this country, what \nwould we do? We would wait. I submit that is what we are proposing to \ndo with this bill, as heroically as the sponsors have worked to get it \nup to the level where they have gotten it up to.\n  If one were a homeowner and had a hole in their roof, they would \nconsider how to fix it. They might try to do it out of their current \nincome. They might take another job to fix it, which would raise their \nincome. They might decide that the best thing to do would be to take \nout a home equity loan and pay for it that way.\n  What they would not do is say: ``Well, this is optional. I am going \nto let this go because it would be irresponsible for me to spend on \nthis. I would be mortgaging my kids' future if I took out a home equity \nloan to fix the hole in the roof.'' They would know eventually they \nwere going to have to fix this hole, because if they waited, what would \nhappen? Was the problem going to get better? No. Holes in roofs do not \nget smaller if they are not fixed, they get bigger, and if one waits \nlong enough, the roof collapses, and then they do have to spend some \nmoney, don't they?\n  My wife called me the other day about this cold weather we have been \nhaving in Missouri, as well as in Washington. We have had ice storms \nand the driveway has been under ice because I did not get out quickly \nenough to scrape it off when the snow and the ice started, which she \nand I had a little discussion about. But she is noticing now that some \nof it is melting, that part of the driveway is beginning to chip. She \nis upset about it, and so we are going to fix that and seal that \ndriveway. What would happen if we waited and we did not do that? The \ncracks in that driveway are not going to get any better. They are going \nto get worse.\n  This highway bill is a lot bigger than the last highway bill--if we \ncan get the number my friends from Oklahoma and Missouri have worked so \nhard to get. It is a lot bigger. It is 30 percent higher than the last \nhighway bill we passed. It is a lot bigger because the problems have \ngotten a lot worse.\n  One thing I will guarantee is, if we do not do something decisively \nto fix this problem now, we are going to have a highway bill 6 years \nfrom now and it will be even bigger. It will be much bigger. The gap \nbetween the size of the bill and what we will need to do then to fix \nthe problem is going to be a lot bigger, too. We are trying to bail out \na boat and we do not have a big enough bucket. Bonding will fix that. \nWe have a chance to do that in this Congress. We have strong bipartisan \nsupport.\n  This is one of the few things we may be able to do on a real \nbipartisan basis. We have support from the transportation community. We \nhave support from the bonding community. There is precedent for this \nall over the country. The cost is extremely small relative to the gain \nand relative to the risk of doing nothing, because if we do not do this \nnow, we are going to pass the bill for our poor transportation system \non to the next generation. Let's not kid ourselves that we are doing \nthem any favors by not investing. We are passing it on to them and we \nare guaranteeing that their bill is going to be a lot bigger than it \nneeds to be. The economic growth they are going to need to be able to \npay that bill when we give it to them is going to be undermined if we \ndo not act now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Before my friend from Missouri leaves, I again say how \nmuch I have enjoyed working with him on this legislation. I think it is \nfair to say that nothing important in the Senate gets done unless it is \nbipartisan.\n  What the Senator from Missouri has done is lead the Senate in an area \nthat I think is bold and innovative. In my view, it is an opportunity \nto provide a real turboboost to our economy. I represent a State that \nconsistently is suffering high unemployment, loads of working-class \nfamilies facing extraordinary economic hurt, and as we have talked \nabout now for a good part of the day, there is no initiative before the \nSenate that will do more to create good-paying jobs than this \nparticular legislation.\n\n[[Page S981]]\n\n  I think it is important for the Senate to say on this bill, at this \ncritical time, that we are not going to stand pat, that the status quo \nis not good enough. Let's not have a business-as-usual transportation \nbill. I like the idea of getting our citizens excited, for example, \nabout buying a child or a grandchild a Build America bond, something \nwhere kids can save and families can engage in an effort to strengthen \nour country's infrastructure, rebuild our critically neglected \ntransportation systems, as the Senator from Missouri has noted, and \nparticularly get the American people involved in the exercise.\n  I have just come from a round of town meetings at home across Oregon \nand talked about Build America bonds. As we have said, this is to \nsupplement the good work that has been done by the Senator from Vermont \nand the Senator from Oklahoma and all of the Senators who have been \npart of our leadership. This is not to supplant existing funds; it is \nto supplement them, and to supplement the transportation sector at a \nvery critical time.\n  I have long believed we cannot have big league economic progress with \nlittle league transportation systems. The pictures that have been shown \ntoday by the Senator from Missouri could essentially be pictures that \ncould come from any of our communities, the communities of Vermont or \nNew Hampshire or any of our individual States. In my State, there are \ntraffic jams and backlogs in communities where no one could have even \ndreamed there would be a traffic jam even a few years ago. So it is for \nthat reason that the Senator from Missouri and I come to offer a \nbipartisan and fresh approach involving a tax credit and an opportunity \nto address our country's transportation needs.\n  I will say to my colleagues that we are very much aware of the \nsituation on the Senate floor with respect to this topic and the \nadministration's views on it. My own belief is that at the end of the \nday, when the Senate and the House get together, led by the \ndistinguished Senator from Vermont, Mr. Jeffords, and the distinguished \nchairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, Senator Inhofe, \nwhen they are in that room at the end of the day negotiating between \nthe Senate and the House, I think they are going to be looking for \nopportunities to do a lot of good in the transportation area where the \npricetag is pretty modest. When you use that as a definition in a \nconference committee, where you are trying to wring out the maximum in \nterms of value for job creation in meeting our country's infrastructure \nneeds, if that is your measure, I think the legislation that Senator \nTalent has authored, with the help of myself and Senator Corzine and \nSenator Coleman of Minnesota--we have been very pleased on our side to \nbe joined by Senator Durbin and Senator Dayton and others--I think when \nthe Senator from Vermont and the distinguished whip, Senator Reid of \nNevada, and others are in that final set of discussions with the House, \nthis proposal is going to look pretty darned good. It is going to look \nvery attractive compared to a tax increase, which certainly some have \ndebated. It is always a noncontroversial topic to discuss tax increases \nin the Senate.\n\n  But I think to go with an approach like this, the Build America Bonds \nInitiative, where, as I learned in the course of the discussion, and \nthe Senator from Missouri has just confirmed, the Federal Government is \nthe only entity now that has not figured out how to do this, it seems \nto me we have an opportunity to address that deficiency and to do it in \na responsible way.\n  The administration has indicated they want to cut the Senate bill. \nThat has certainly generated concern in many quarters. It seems to me, \nwhen we can find hundreds of billions of dollars for various kinds of \ninternational challenges and concerns around the world, we can do some \nrebuilding here at home. I think this bonding proposal is a very \ninnovative approach to, in effect, think outside the trust funds, think \noutside the box, and because of the various opportunities for \ntransportation services to be addressed, this legislation lets the \ncountry think outside the gas tank.\n  As we have indicated, we call on this legislation for issuing \nfederally backed bonds to pay for new transportation construction \nprojects. A very broad coalition of groups has come together, groups \nrepresenting business organizations, labor organizations, and all of \nthem are united around the proposition that at a time when workers and \ncommunities are reeling from layoffs and getting pounded economically, \nwe ought to look for opportunities to responsibly get the dollars that \nare needed for the transportation sector.\n  The Build America Bonds Program is a stimulus that will generate \nfunding for our economy today. It is a chance for the Federal \nGovernment to hold up its end of the bargain with our States. I am \nhopeful Congress will finish the critical work on this legislation \nquickly, but more than anything, let us pass a transportation bill that \nis not business as usual. These are not standpat times. This is not a \ntime, based on the meetings I just had in Oregon, where folks will say \nlet's just keep doing what we have been doing and we can stand pat \nbecause everything is hunky-dory. I think they are looking for bolder \nand more creative ways to get our citizens and our economy going where \nwe need to go.\n  The legislation Senator Talent and I have sponsored will help America \nget going in the right direction by providing additional funding to \nmeet our country's transportation and economic needs.\n  I understand the situation with respect to the floor and the Senate \ntoday. I hope our colleagues will continue to work with Senator Talent \nand me as we go forward in the Senate, as it is debated with the House, \nbecause I am absolutely convinced that in the last hours of this \ndiscussion, when the Senate and the House are looking for a way to meet \nthis country's transportation needs and looking for a way to do it in a \ncost-effective fashion, they will say the legislation that Senator \nTalent and I have put together is an opportunity to do a lot of good in \na fashion that is fiscally responsible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I am not going to inflict myself much more \non the subject, but my friend spoke so eloquently on it, and I wanted \nto add a little bit to what he was saying, particularly with regard to \ncost.\n  The thing he and I emphasized that I believe is so important is that \nthese problems we have in transportation are problems that are not \ngoing to go away if we don't do anything. If the Federal Government \nwere a private company and its capital infrastructure were in the \ncondition that America's capital infrastructure is in, you would have \nto list that somehow on the books as affecting the valuation of the \ncompany. I am no expert on these things, but that inadequate capital \ninfrastructure of that company would be an ongoing obligation of the \ncompany. It would be a debt that the company has to pay because \neverybody in the commonsense world, if I can say that, understands that \neventually you have to deal with this issue.\n  It is also common knowledge, uncontested, that in particular with \nregard to transportation, when you delay, costs go up a lot because \nthere are so many inputs to transportation costs: Material costs; \nwages, of course, go up, one hopes, periodically; costs of right-of-way \ncan go up. There are a lot of things affecting those costs. Everybody \nknows it is dangerous to put off projects because costs can escalate \nfar beyond the rate of inflation, far beyond what you are earning on \nthe money you are not spending because you didn't want to pay for the \ntransportation.\n  Under current market conditions we estimate this proposal of ours \nwould cost about $2.5 billion a year, which is about, not 1 percent, \nbut one-tenth of 1 percent of the entire Federal budget. It is \nconsiderably less than other proposals which have been made for new \nkinds of spending, and which I have generally supported, but which were \nnot paid for by any other new stream of revenue. For example, the \nglobal AIDS bill, which received wide support in the Senate and which I \ncertainly supported, costs more every year than this costs.\n  This kind of spending empowers us. This kind of spending gives us the \nopportunity to create jobs. The Senator from Oregon and I have not even \ntalked about the dynamic impact of transportation investment. But if \nyou Members\n\n[[Page S982]]\n\ndon't believe that investment in roads and highways and rail and \ntransit has a dynamic impact, go and talk to the economic development \npeople in your State--in the urban areas, in the smaller towns. They \nare all for this.\n  I remember when I was traveling around Missouri in support of Build \nAmerica Bonds and I went to Springfield, one of our dynamic cities in \nMissouri. I had a meeting at the Chamber of Commerce. The head of the \nchamber came rushing up to me and he said: ``You know, I like the tax \ncut. But this,'' he was waving the one page we had for Build America \nBonds, ``is a jobs stimulus.''\n  He understands that.\n  This is a proposal whose time has more than come. I want to reiterate \nwhat the Senator from Oregon said. I know the problems the bill faces. \nWe certainly do not want to imperil the underlying bill for this. I \nwould not do that. I don't want to suggest that those supporting this \nbill have not done great work. I am looking forward to supporting this \nhighway bill. But at some point in this process we need to be able to \nconfront this because this is not a problem that is going to get any \nbetter if we don't do anything about it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Jobs Move Overseas\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I will address the most important \nsubject we have confronting us in this country. It is brought about by \na headline yesterday in the Los Angeles Times, ``Bush Supports Shift of \nJobs Overseas.'' I know the distinguished Presiding Officer, as well as \nthis particular Senator, was shocked to see that. But it is the truth. \nIt is unfortunate because of the policy of this particular body, the \nSenate, we are as guilty as the President of the United States.\n  I hear my colleagues weeping and wailing, how could he say such a \nthing? Heavens above, how could you pass fast track? It's just shipping \njobs overseas faster. There's all this free trade, free trade whining; \nall of this level the playing field, level the playing field but we're \nshipping jobs overseas.\n  What really happens is the distinguished President--I don't know what \nhis situation is with respect to being AWOL in the National Guard, but \nI make a categorical statement--and many others are AWOL from the trade \nwar. Now let's talk about the Afghanistan war, the Iraq war, the \nterrorism war, but more than anything else, a trade war.\n  Senator, let me tell you how to start one. It was in the earliest \nStates, the colonies that are great forefathers started. That is the \ngreatest generation. We sit around here, a few of us, veterans from \nWorld War II being called the greatest generation. But the real heroes \nare not here. The real greatest generation was Madison and Jefferson \nand Washington and Hamilton and Adams. That was the real great \ngeneration of our time.\n  The colonies had just won their freedom when the mother country \ncorresponded back and proposed exactly what we hear today, economists \nrunning around all over the land yelling ``comparative advantage.'' \nToday, we read in the Los Angeles Times article about the comparative \nadvantage. But the doctrine started with David Ricardo, when the \nBritish suggested what to do is trade back to the mother country what \nyou produce best--your comparative advantage--and they will trade back \nwith you what they produce best. Free trade, free trade, free trade.\n\n  Alexander Hamilton wrote a little booklet, ``Report On \nManufacturers.'' I say to the Senator, there is one copy in the Library \nof Congress. I have been allowed to make a copy of it, but that is the \nonly original copy I know of. But, in any event, rather than wasting \nthe time of putting it in the Record here, in a line, Hamilton told the \nBritish: Bug off. We are not going to remain your colonies, shipping to \nyou the rice, the cotton, the indigo, the timber, the iron ore, and the \nnatural produce of the land, and continue to import the manufacturing.\n  There was a law before we won our freedom that you could not erect a \nmanufacturing plant in the Colonies. It was against the law to produce. \nOh, yes.\n  So how do you start a trade war? On July 4, 1789, the second measure \nthat passed the Congress in its history--the first was the Seal of the \nUnited States--but the second, on July 4, 1789, was a tariff bill. It \nwas protectionism. It was a 50-percent tariff on over 60 articles. That \nis how we started to build up our economic strength.\n  Our economic strength, I say to the Senator, is the vital leg in the \nthree-legged stool of a nation's security. You have the one leg of a \nnation's values. That was unquestioned until we started preemptive \nwars. But we are known the world around--they do not hate us. They do \nnot like this policy, but they do not hate Americans. I have traveled \nthe world for the last 37 years, and I can tell you they love America. \nThey revere our stand for individual freedom, democracy, and human \nrights.\n  We have sacrificed the world around; and we still are. We have, \ncounting in Afghanistan and Iraq and Kuwait, 14 peacekeeping forces \naround the world right now. So we have sacrificed.\n  But there is no sacrifice for this war in Iraq back home, and there \nis no sacrifice in this Congress. We need a tax cut so we can get \nreelected. So we tell the poor fellow in downtown Baghdad: We hope you \ndon't get killed. And we really hope you don't get killed because we \nwant you to hurry back so we can give you the bill.\n  But, in any event, the second leg is the military, unquestioned as \nthe world's superpower. We have the fine soldiers we have deployed in \nboth Afghanistan and Iraq and elsewhere in those peacekeeping outfits. \nMore particularly, the economic leg, that third leg is what has been \nfractured.\n  Now how did we build it up? How do you build an economy? Every \ncountry in the world is engaged in this trade war. You have to compete. \nYou have to protect your economic interests.\n  After the forefathers came Abraham Lincoln, the father of the \nRepublican Party. When they came to President Lincoln and said: We are \ngoing to build the transcontinental railroad, and we are going to get \nsteel, he said: We are not going to get the steel from Britain. We are \ngoing to build our own steel mills. When they were completed, they not \nonly had a transcontinental railroad but a steel capacity under Abraham \nLincoln.\n  In the darkest days of the Depression, Franklin Delano Roosevelt \nprotected America's agriculture. It is still the envy the world around. \nBut we put in import quotas, subsidies for agriculture, and they should \nbe protected unless we want to lose that. They jump all over poor Trade \nRepresentative Zoellick. He finally got a free trade agreement with \nAustralia. There were exemptions--dairy exemptions, farm exemptions. \nYou get what you can. We don't have just one agreement and that is the \nend of the world. If you cannot get an agreement with Australia, our \nbest ally--and their standard of living, they have labor rights, \nenvironmental rights galore in Australia--if we cannot get a free trade \nagreement with that group, we are not going to get a free trade \nagreement with anybody. So we got it. I would support that because we \nhave the same standard of living.\n  Not only President Roosevelt, but Dwight David Eisenhower was a \nprotectionist. He put on oil import quotas--back in the mid-1950s.\n  And John Fitzgerald Kennedy--he had import quotas on textiles. He had \na seven-point program to protect textiles. I helped write it. I can see \nme down in the press room now with Pierre Salinger and Andy Hatcher, \nthe assistant in the press room in the White House. I will give you an \noriginal copy of the seven-point program. But we saved, with the \nmultifiber arrangement, textile production in America until we started \ngiving it away willy-nilly in yarn. We gave away $2 billion to Turkey \nin Desert Storm. We gave away $1 billion here and $1 billion there. \nThey continue with the African, the Caribbean agreements, and \neverywhere else.\n\n  President Reagan came down to South Carolina, and he committed to \nprotect textiles. We passed the textile bill through the House and the \nSenate just to enforce the multifiber agreement. He vetoed it. We \npassed it under\n\n[[Page S983]]\n\n``Papa'' Bush through the House and the Senate just to enforce the \nmultifiber agreement, and ``Papa'' Bush, who had committed to textiles, \nvetoed it.\n  They keep coming in to Greenville, SC, promising, promising anything \nduring an election. I have to come up here to Washington and watch them \ngo back on their promises. So don't give me any of this stuff about \nprotectionism.\n  Let me tell you, fair and square, we are in a trade war. That is how \nyou build up your economic strength. Before you open your front door, I \nsay to the Senator from Vermont, for ``Jeffords Manufacturing,'' you \nwill need to pay minimum wage, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid. You \nwill need to have clean air, clean water, plant closing notice, \nparental leave, safe working place, safe machinery--I can keep going \ndown the list.\n  So what happens? You can go to China and open a plant for 58 cents an \nhour--and none of that, none of that. Still, let's talk ``cents.'' If \nyour competition goes, you have to go. If you continue to work your own \npeople, you go bankrupt. So, you see, they have given dignity to this \ndilemma with this headline: Supports the Jobs Overseas. We in the \nCongress are responsible for setting the trade policy. We are the \nguilty parties around here. We have to change the culture and say: \nDon't worry about this free trade and that you might start a trade war. \nWe are in the war.\n  We started unilaterally disarming for a wonderful purpose after World \nWar II. Let me tell you where we were before World War II. This is the \nmost interesting thing because this is not a politician speaking. This \nis none other than the famous author Edmund Morris in ``Theodore Rex.'' \nI will just read you a few short paragraphs about where we were at the \nturn of the century. I am quoting from ``Theodore Rex'':\n\n       The first year of the new century found her worth twenty-\n     five billion more than her nearest rival, Great Britain, with \n     a gross national product more than twice that of Germany and \n     Russia. The United States was already so rich in goods and \n     services that she was more self-sustaining than any \n     industrial power in history.\n       Indeed, it could only consume a fraction of what it \n     produced. The rest went overseas at prices other exporters \n     found hard to match. As Andrew Carnegie said, ``the nation \n     that makes the cheapest steel has other nations at its \n     feet.'' More than half of the world's cotton, corn, copper, \n     and oil flowed from the American cornucopia, and at least one \n     third of all steel, iron, silver and gold.\n       Even if the United States were not so blessed with raw \n     materials, the excellence of her manufactured products \n     guaranteed her dominance of the world markets. Current \n     advertisements in the British magazines gave the impression \n     that the typical Englishman woke to the ring of an Ingersoll \n     alarm, shaved with a Gillette razor, combed his hair with \n     Vaseline tonic, buttoned his Arrow shirt, hurried downstairs \n     for Quaker Oats, California figs, Maxwell House coffee, \n     commuted in a Westinghouse tram (body by Fisher) rose to his \n     office in an Otis elevator and worked all day with his \n     Waterman pen under the efficient glare of Edison lightbulbs. \n     ``It only remains,'' one Fleet Street wag suggested, ``for \n     [us] to take American coal to Newcastle.'' Behind the joke \n     lay real concerns. The United States was already supplying \n     beer to Germany, pottery to Bohemia, and oranges to Valencia.\n\n  Now we import all of it. And why? Because at the end of World War II, \nin order to prosper, we had to spread prosperity, the Marshall plan. We \nsent over not just the money of the Marshall billions, we sent over the \nexpertise, the equipment. And it worked. We industrialized Europe and \nthe Pacific rim and capitalism has defeated communism. So it worked. \nBut in that 50-year period, we more or less unilaterally disarmed.\n  I can remember back as a young Governor in 1960, I testified before \nthe old international tariff commission, and Tom Dewey was the lawyer \nfor the Japanese. He was chasing me around, and I was attesting to the \nfact that if this continued, with imports of textiles, 10 percent of \nthe American consumption in textiles would be represented in imports. \nOver two-thirds of the clothing I am looking at now is imported, not 10 \npercent. Over 86 percent of the shoes are imported. And so it goes with \nautomobiles and steel and hand tools and everything else.\n  I have been watching Lou Dobbs. He has had a series on how the world \nis sending us their architects; then they are sending over medical \npersonnel, and doctors in America are sending mammograms to be read in \nIndia. And then I find out that my utility in South Carolina--SCANA--\nwas administering my light bills in downtown Bangalore, India, and my \nFood Stamp Program at the State capital in my home State had moved to \nIndia. I said: Heavens above.\n  The other night I turned on the series, and now we are moving our law \nwork to lawyers abroad. Instead of hiring paralegals for $75,000 to \n$80,000 a year in New York to do the background work on a brief or an \nappeal--they are moving the work to lawyers overseas. They are going to \nmove everything overseas except politicians. We are already too cheap, \nI can tell you that. They will be importing everything except us \npoliticians. And we keep sitting around whining and beating the desks \nand showing charts how we are leveling the playing field.\n  How do you think you level the playing field? You raise a barrier \nagainst a barrier and then remove them both. This proposition of the \nGolden Rule doesn't work in business, I can tell you that.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Yes, sir.\n  Mr. REID. I would like the Senator to comment on the Los Angeles \nTimes headline: ``Bush Supports Shift to Jobs Overseas.''\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Show that to the viewing public, please. That is the \ntheme here.\n  Mr. REID. You are aware, of course--that is why you are here--of \n``the loss of work to other countries, while painful in the short term, \nwill enrich the economy, his report to Congress says.'' This is the man \nwho succeeded Lawrence Lindsey, who had such a great career in the \nFederal Government. You are familiar with Lawrence Lindsey, are you \nnot?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I surely am.\n  Mr. REID. This is his successor. I think he will maybe fit in the \nsame shoes as Lawrence Lindsey did. So the Senator doesn't think this \nis such a good philosophy, that we are shipping all the jobs overseas?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I tell you, it has been ship, ship, ship. And who is \nfinancing this extravagance we have going? Let me bring you up to date. \nIn 2003, as of the end of November, the Chinese had borrowed, in the \nPeople's Republic $143.8 billion and at Hong Kong $55.5 billion. So \nthey have financed your and my extravagance to the tune of $199.7 \nbillion--they are financing our debt.\n  Treasury Secretary John Snow goes to China and he says: How about \nfloating your yen here so we can do away with that advantage you have? \nAnd the fellows in Beijing say: Bug off, boy. Go on back home. We might \nstart selling your bonds rather than buying them, if you don't think \nthat will wreck your economy and get the Democrats elected in November. \nThat is what they told Snow. And Snow put his tail between his legs and \ncame home. This is what controls the trade policy. We don't control it \nbecause we abdicate. Just like President Bush is AWOL in the trade war, \nwe have been AWOL in the trade war--we have, this Congress.\n\n  Article I, section 8, of the Constitution reads that the Congress of \nthe United States shall regulate foreign commerce. What do we do? We \nbug out. We want the money from the big guys and the rich guys and the \nmultinationals, so we bug out and say, oh, no, you take it, Mr. \nPresident, we will give you fast track so we cannot even amend trade \nagreements and you have the responsibility. With that responsibility, \nhe goes AWOL. Here is the headline. And we are AWOL.\n  You have the candidates running all over the land weeping and wailing \nabout jobs. Let me tell you one thing, Mr. President. If you are going \nto try to rebuild an economy, you have to do one thing. I am going to \ngive you our jobs omnibus bill and we will draw it up and I will get \nthe distinguished Senator from Vermont to look at it and see what he \nthinks of it.\n  No. 1, what we have to do is immediately quit financing the move of \njobs overseas. I will never forget, I called Walter Allen Drissi. In \nLexington, SC, I helped him with the water and sewer lines. He went out \nand got himself organized and started a high-tech company, Avenax. He \ngot involved with Bill Gates and MCI. So 4 or 5 years ago, when his \nstock was up, I called Walter\n\n[[Page S984]]\n\nout in California and I said: Now, when you expand, I want a plant \nsomewhere in South Carolina. We were good to you and you still have a \nhome in Columbia.\n  He said: I will keep my home. I love South Carolina, but I don't make \nanything in this country. He said: I got my research and sales out \nhere. He said: I go right to China for my product. I get a year-to-year \ncontract. I don't have to build a plant. They have the plant and the \nworkforce. I got a quality man and I am sitting here with the Internet. \nI watch it every day. My good and trusted man watches the quality. I \nmake two or three visits a year. At the end of the year, I have made a \nwonderful profit. If I haven't, I haven't lost anything really because \nI don't have to renew the contract. If I have done better than \nexpected, I get another contract. It is a sweetheart deal.\n  That is what is going on with American business. Do you know who the \nenemy within is? The enemy within is our best organizations--the \nBusiness Roundtable, the Conference Board, the National Association of \nManufacturers, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, National Federation of \nIndependent Business. They are running all over the floor saying: free \ntrade, free trade, free trade. Are you for free trade? And we jump like \nmonkeys and say, yes, I am for free trade, but I want to level the \nplaying field. This is nauseating. I have been watching this for years.\n  Even the newspapers are against it. They make a majority of their \nprofits on retail advertising, and the retailers buy all their products \noverseas.\n  I used to sit right where the Senator is standing, talking about how \nretailers have 100,000 articles at Christmastime, and when they run out \nof supplies and need another 10,000 dozen quick they would get it from \nNew Jersey. But now they make a way greater profit on the imported \narticle than on the New Jersey production. So the retailers make all \ntheir profits on the imported articles, and they advertise and they \ncall up and they give the already canned editorials to the newspapers, \nso all the newspapers are hollering free trade, free trade, saying it \ncreates jobs. It loses jobs.\n  I have lost 58,000 jobs since President Bush has taken office. Come \non. My State is in trouble. That is why all the candidates were running \naround there making promises. They started a movement. But they have to \nunderstand that we have to change the culture.\n  How do you change the culture? You change the culture by, No. 1, quit \nfinancing them, and letting them keep the profits they make overseas. \nThey don't have to pay income tax. That has to stop. We have a bill in \nthat takes those benefits from overseas production and gives it to the \nparticular domestic manufacturer that continues to work his own people.\n  No. 2, we have to start enforcing our laws. I have worked with the \nprivate community over the years in customs law and enforcement of \ntrade laws, and it has been left to the manufacturer and the private \nentity to enforce it.\n  I will never forget the final climax of this so-called enforcement in \ncustoms laws occurred back when President Reagan was President. If you \nhad a problem, you had to go first before the International Trade \nAdministration, prove a dumping violation, come before the \nInternational Trade Commission and prove an injury, and then go to the \nU.S. Supreme Court and prove the legality; and then you have one final \nstep, where the President of the United States, on national security \nprovisions, can vitiate the whole thing.\n  In the Zenith case, they won it all. They won before the Trade \nAdministration and the International Trade Commission. They won before \nthe Supreme Court. Then the Cabinet was gathered around the table and \nthey agreed unanimously to enforce the finding. In walked President \nReagan and he said: I have talked to Prime Minister of Japan and we are \ngoing to have to reverse that. That was the end of it--three years, \nmillions of dollars, all kinds of motions and pleadings and everything \nelse, and it didn't get anywhere.\n  So the real trial bar in trade cases has just about disappeared \nbecause it is not worth the billable hours to go through the exercise. \nWe need an Assistant Attorney General on textile laws. We have an \nAssistant Attorney General on antitrust. We need an Assistant Attorney \nGeneral on trade laws and on dumping.\n  We ought to start enforcing our dumping or selling lost leaders below \ncost. That is against the law in the domestic economy and the \ncapitalistic society that we have, to have lost leaders and sell below \ncost. That is exactly what they are doing.\n  That Lexus that costs $32,000 in America sells for $42,000 in Tokyo \non the main street there. They have been selling below cost here, \nfinancing with the banking system to get market share. They don't care \nabout profits. Market share is the competition.\n  They say it is not WTO compatible. Well, if it is not World Trade \nOrganization compatible, we have to change that or get out of the World \nTrade Organization. After getting that, in addition to enforcing our \nlaws, we have to make sure we have the customs agents.\n  I got an office in the Customs house in Charleston, SC. I used to go \nto them on textiles and they said: Senator, wait a minute, we are \nshorthanded. Do you want me to enforce drugs or textiles?\n  I said: No, no, let's be sure we get the drugs.\n  Now I go to them and they say: Wait a minute. Do you want me to \nenforce homeland security, or drugs, or textiles?\n  I say homeland security and drugs, forget about the textiles.\n  The Treasury Department and Customs testified that they got 5 billion \nin transshipments--illegal transshipments of textiles into this \ncountry. We could save thousands of jobs if we could just get that law \nenforced.\n  We need specifically to fully fund the Manufacturing Extension \nPartnership and the Advanced Technology Program. We need a list of the \ncritical materials in the Defense Department that are necessary to our \nnational security. We must make sure we aren't running a deficit in the \nbalance of those critical materials.\n\n  Do you know why we waited that long to go into Desert Storm? We \ncouldn't get the flat panel displays for the lookdown, see-down, before \nwe could go in and decimate Saddam. Now, for much of that defense \nmateriel we have to depend on allies whom this administration has made \ngenerally unfriendly.\n  Come on, in this terror war, might doesn't make right; right makes \nmight in the war on terror. Don't worry about a big old defense budget. \nGet me a big old State Department budget. Let's start making friends. \nWe can't do this by ourselves. We are whistling ``Dixie'' running \naround with an atom bomb and a bunch of GIs killing.\n  The question is: Was it really worth the invasion of Iraq to get rid \nof Saddam with 530-some American dead, over 3,000 injured, $160 billion \nin costs, and creating more terrorism rather than less terrorism? We \nactually, this minute, have more terrorism rather than less terrorism. \nWe hope--and we want to support our effort in Iraq to bring it to as \nquick a conclusion as possible--we hope we have democracy, but right \nnow, if you had to call the hand, it would be a loser because we were \nmisled into this war.\n  Saddam Hussein didn't have any weapons of mass destruction, but when \nthe President--and I want to explain that vote--when the President on \nOctober 7, 2002, said there is clear evidence of peril--those are his \nwords, ``clear evidence of peril''--we cannot wait until the smoking \ngun is a mushroom cloud.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Wait a minute. That was on October 7. On October 11, we \nvoted. Once the Commander in Chief says there is clear evidence of \nperil, and 4 days later we have a vote, anybody reasonably sane and \nprudent would vote to support his Commander in Chief. We thought there \nwas clear evidence of peril. There was not clear evidence of peril.\n  I will be delighted to yield.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, is the Senator aware that 13 months ago \nthey found 11 chemical rockets with warheads that would hold 140 liters \nof any kind of chemical? They found with that VX gas enough to load \nthese 11 rockets. Subsequent to that they found 36 more. That is 47. \nEach rocket, with 140 liters of VX gas, can kill a million people; is \nthe Senator aware of that? Would the Senator call that a weapon of mass \ndestruction?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. We ought to make my colleague, Senator Inhofe, the \ninspector rather than David Kay, who didn't find any of what the \nSenator was\n\n[[Page S985]]\n\nlisting. In other words, I don't think there is any more argument. \nThere might have been a little bit here, a little bit there, but there \nwas no imminent threat. There was no clear evidence of peril. You can \nfind stuff that could have killed anybody. We could all get the chicken \nflu, but we are not trying to eliminate the State of Delaware because \nthey have a little chicken flu there. Come on.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield further?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Yes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. If they found 47 chemical rockets, rockets that would \nhold 140 liters of chemicals, why would they have them if they didn't \nintend on using them against somebody? Would you inform the Senator?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Why didn't they use them? Excuse me, why didn't they \nuse it? You found them, why didn't they use them? Why didn't you call \nSaddam and say use them?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Why did they have them if they weren't wanting to use \nthem at some point?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. What is the excuse? You should have called him, you \nfound them, and Saddam didn't use them. The proof of the pudding is in \nthe eating. You are running around on the floor of the Senate finding \nall kinds of things, but we had inspectors upon inspectors, and they \nhave pretty well proved there was no clear evidence of peril.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Yes.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I commend the Senator for his accurate statement \nrelative to the purported threats. There was no way to deliver. I think \n900 miles was the furthest rockets could carry, and there was no threat \nreally ever given anyway. I want to clear that up from my perspective.\n\n  I thank the Senator from South Carolina more so for the wonderful \neconomic history of this Nation he has given us and how we came to the \nincredibly strong positions we were in but now find ourselves \ndissipating all those great triumphs we had in the past and watching \nthem all march overseas.\n  I think what Senator Hollings has given us today ought to be put in \nmarble so everybody can read and better understand the situation of \nthis Nation at this time. I thank him for that wonderful contribution \nto our history.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. The Senator from Vermont has been overgenerous to me, \nbut I think what we both agree we are at fault as much as the President \nin shipping jobs overseas. We are the ones under the Constitution, \narticle I, section 8, the Congress, not the President, not the Supreme \nCourt, the Congress shall regulate foreign commerce, but we have \nabdicated our responsibility, and we have gladly done so. Why? Because \nthe Conference Board and the Business Roundtable and the United States \nChamber of Commerce gives us money, and we need the money to run. So we \ntake the money and run and avoid our responsibilities.\n  We have to change the whole culture. We are into a dynamic trade war. \nWe had a plus balance 10 years ago with Europe. We have a negative \nbalance now. NAFTA hasn't worked. We had a $5 billion-plus balance \nbefore NAFTA. Now it is a negative $15 billion balance, and the average \nMexican worker is not making less. What we really need is a Marshall \nPlan for our neighbor, the country of Mexico. That is what we ought to \nhave rather than going back and forth.\n  We had last year a $500 billion trade deficit, and about $500 billion \nin a budget deficit. So we have infused--infused--$1 trillion in the \nlast year into the economy, and we created no jobs. That should worry \neverybody in the Congress. And what the President proposed for next \nyear's budget is not a $521 billion deficit. Look on page 392, and you \nwill find it's a $726 billion budget deficit that he proposes, and he \ndoesn't include anything for Afghanistan and Iraq and the cost of the \nalternative minimum tax, which is another $200 billion.\n  We are in real trouble. We have to sit down in a bipartisan way and \nquit running around with the signs saying the President is AWOL, \nbecause the Congress is AWOL. That is my beef. I fought these trade \nbills. I couldn't get anybody's attention, but now we have their \nattention. Baloney with that Business Roundtable, and profits, and \ndownsizing and moving overseas. Let's make it profitable for \nmanufacturers to do business in the United States. That is common \nsense. I say to the Senator from Vermont, doesn't he want to do that? I \nam sure he does. I thank the distinguished Senator for his kind \nattention. These are the most important issues we have ever had. There \nisn't any question about that.\n  The January 27th New York Times reports that at a business meeting in \nDavos, Zhu Min, an economic adviser to the President of China, was met \nwith silence when he asked Americans how their country planned to \nfinance its economy with both blue collar manufacturing and white \ncollar service jobs going elsewhere.\n  The world has changed. Come on, wake up and start working out a good \njobs policy in this Congress and quit blaming each other. There is \nplenty of blame to go around for all of us. But when it gets so bad \nthat the economic adviser to the President of China, is asking how you \npay your bill with all of these jobs going over here, and the economic \nadviser to the President of the United States says, ``Right on, we need \nmore of them overseas, it is good for the country,'' we are in real \ntrouble.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak for up to 30 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n\n\n            The Future of Science and Technology in America\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, for the last 2\\1/2\\ years the primary \nefforts of the President and much of official Washington have focused \non: How do we meet the threat of terrorism? Clearly, that is a threat \nwe need to meet as a country, but there are other threats and other \nchallenges that demand our attention as well. The first, most important \nof those, in my view, is the need to create high-wage jobs. Others have \nspoken about that. The Senator from South Carolina spoke about it. \nOthers in the Senate have spoken about it in the last few days.\n  High-wage job creation requires, as a precondition, that we adopt \nsound monetary and fiscal policies. The monetary policy we leave up to \nthe Federal Reserve, but the responsibility for maintaining sound \nfiscal policy rests with the President and with the Congress. Both this \nPresident and this Congress have failed miserably in carrying out that \nresponsibility.\n  Much has been said about that failure, and I am not going to repeat \nthose arguments again today. But even if the President and the Congress \ncome to their senses and pursue a policy that is responsible with \nregard to fiscal affairs, the problem of how we are going to create \nhigh-wage jobs is still unaddressed.\n  So the question is: What actions can we take to achieve that goal? \nEach of us can list at least some of the building blocks for a high-\nwage society, fair and equitable tax structure, an educated and skilled \nworkforce, an efficient, robust transportation infrastructure, a modern \ncommunications infrastructure, and so on.\n\n  I would argue that any discussion of high-wage job creation should \nstart with what military strategists refer to as the point of the \nspear, the tip of the spear, and I firmly believe that in the economic \ncompetition for high-wage job creation, this point of the spear is \nscience and technology. Just as in the case of our national security, \nour economic future depends on our remaining the world leader in \nscience and technology. If that leadership is lost, then our capacity \nfor high-wage job creation will soon atrophy.\n  Joseph Schumpeter, who taught all of us about the creative \ndestruction that is inherent in our capitalist system, the competition \nthat is brought on by new technologies and new markets destroys \ncompanies, it destroys entire industries. Jobs that existed in those \nindustries are lost, only to be replaced by new jobs in other \nindustries, in new companies that are nimble enough to take advantage \nof the dynamic change that is ongoing at all times.\n\n[[Page S986]]\n\n  As Andy Grove of Intel has said, only the paranoid survive. If we \nwant the United States to lead in the 21st century, we need to \nrecognize that the world of the future is being shaped by new \ntechnologies and their rapid diffusion. Entire industries may disappear \nin the process or be utterly transformed, and there are many examples. \nOne is the entire industry of recorded music that is being reshaped by \nthe ease of downloading music from the Internet. Sales of recorded CDs \nhave been dropping each year for the past few years. Today, blank CDs \nfor making recordings at home substantially outsell recorded CDs. When \none walks into Staples or Office Depot, one sees a big display of blank \nCDs for sale, and one can be certain that most of those CDs are not \ndestined to be used to store spreadsheets of data. Even the small \nnumber of high-profile lawsuits against individuals who burn disks of \nmusic without regard to the copyrights have not substantially altered \nthis phenomenon.\n  The music industry still is in search of a mechanism to adapt to this \nfundamentally new business environment brought about by the diffusion \nof two new technologies; that is, the Internet and, secondly, cheap CD-\nburning drives.\n  Another example: The biotechnology industry. This is an industry that \nhas sprung up in a very short period of time. The basic patent for \ngenetic engineering, the Cohen-Boyer patent on making recombinant DNA, \nwas issued 30 years ago. No one at that time could have predicted we \nwould one day have a biological industry rivaling the chemical \nprocessing industry that was already a century old at that point.\n  The United States has reaped enormous economic benefits from being \nthe first country to lead in the development of the Internet and the \nharnessing of biotechnology, but these revolutions are far from being \nthe last technological revolutions we have seen or will see in the \nfuture.\n  So the key questions at this point in time for us are: Which \ncountries will win the competition to develop these new industries, \nthese new jobs, based on future technological changes? Which countries \nwill benefit overall from those changes? Which countries will lose out? \nAfter the current wave of technological change has passed, which \ncountries will be best positioned for the next inevitable wave of \nchange?\n  We ignore these questions at our peril. After reviewing the \nPresident's proposed 2005 budget for science and technology, I am \npersuaded that this administration is ignoring these questions now. It \nis clear that we are, in fact, in the middle of a set of interrelated \ntechnological revolutions that are both reshaping existing industries \nand leading in a number of cases to entirely new industries.\n  A short list of those ongoing revolutions would include the \nfollowing: Microelectronics, particularly the continued miniaturization \nand diffusion of data processing power; secondly, high-end super \ncomputing; third, telecommunications technologies; fourth, man-made \nmaterials, including materials in which the structure has been designed \nand built at the atomic or the molecular level.\n  This is, in essence, nanotechnology. Another example is robotics. \nAnother is biotechnology, which I have referred to before. Also, \ntechnologies to increase energy supply such as renewable energy \ntechnologies that are as inexpensive as traditional fossil fuel sources \nof energy and that use hydrogen as an energy carrier, and also \ntechnologies for increased energy conservation. We know that these \ntechnologies are crucial to our future.\n  The question is: Will America play a leading role in their continued \ndevelopment? The answer is not that self-evident. In the 60 years since \nWorld War II, other countries and other regions of the world have built \nscience and technology capabilities that rival ours today and in many \ncases are destined to rival ours in the future. The Governments of \nChina and India and Japan and the European Union have all targeted \nadvancements in their research and innovation system as key elements of \ntheir plans for future national and regional economic prosperity. Even \nif we have a strong science and technology policy in this country, \nthese other countries and regions will give us stiff competition.\n\n  Unfortunately, though, just as this international challenge is \nbecoming very clear, this administration appears to be sticking its \nhead in the sand. A look at the budget proposal for fiscal year 2005 \nsubmitted by President Bush on February 2, shows the serious gaps in \nsupport of the kind of basic science and engineering that will be the \nmost important to the development of technologies and industries of the \nfuture. Let me give some examples:\n  The budget proposes $660 million in cuts for basic and applied \nresearch at the Department of Defense, the sort of research that has \nthe greatest potential for dual use and effective spinoff to the \ncivilian high-technology industries.\n  There is a proposed $68 million cut for the Department of Energy's \nOffice of Science, which is a major supporter of basic physical \nsciences and engineering research.\n  There is a $63 million proposed cut for energy conservation research \nand development at the Department of Energy.\n  There is a proposed $183 million cut for fiscal year 2005 for \nagricultural research.\n  There is a proposed $24 million cut for transportation research.\n  There is the proposed total elimination of the Advanced Technology \nProgram in the Department of Commerce. That is a loss of $171 million \nfor new technologies that would otherwise have been enabled and brought \nto commercial reality. This termination of the Advanced Technology \nProgram is particularly egregious in light of the circumstances we \nface.\n  The rationale for the termination in the President's own budget \ndocument deserves to be enshrined as some sort of classic wrongheaded \nreasoning. Let me read this for anyone who is listening to understand \nwhat was said. This is word for word out of the President's budget \ndocument. The heading is ``Advanced Technology Program--ATP.'' This is \na description:\n\n       The ATP endeavors to help accelerate the commercialization \n     of high-risk, broad-benefit enabling technologies with \n     significant commercial potential. ATP is a merit-based, \n     rigorously competitive, cost-shared partnership program that \n     provides assistance to U.S. businesses and joint R ventures \n     to help them improve their competitive position. The \n     President's 2005 Budget proposes to eliminate the program \n     and, therefore, no funds are requested for FY 2005.\n\n  So that is it. I did not add a single word. I did not subtract a \nsingle word from the President's rationale. Literally it says ATP is a \ngreat program; it helps our competitiveness; it is effective. \nTherefore, we propose to kill it.\n  There is another aspect to President Bush's budget that makes the \npoint that science and technology policy is a low priority for this \nadministration. That is the underfunding of important R programs that \nCongress has recently authorized by overwhelming margins and that the \nPresident has signed into law.\n  One example is cybersecurity research and development. Every American \nknows that computer viruses and worms can cause serious damage to the \neconomy. In November of 2002, Congress passed, and the President \nsigned, the Cyber Security Research and Development Act. That bill \nauthorized a significant program of research and development on \ncomputer and network security in the National Science Foundation. For \nfiscal year 2005, those R authorizations amounted to just over $122 \nmillion.\n\n  After signing the bill, the President had a complete budget cycle to \ndevelop a budget request incorporating the authorizations that he \nsigned into law. There appears to be no proposed funding in 2005 in the \nNational Science Foundation to carry out the law. In essence, the \nPresident's signature on a law to increase R investment in \ncybersecurity meant nothing when it came time for the administration to \nput together a proposed budget for 2005. In fact, the budget element \nfor the National Science Foundation budget that would fund this \nactivity is proposed for a decrease of $40 million.\n  A similar situation has occurred in the area of nanotechnology. \nAgain, last year Congress passed, and the President signed, a major \nresearch authorization bill for nanotechnology. The contents of the \nbill were well known during the bulk of the budget cycle. For fiscal \nyear 2005, the bill provide for nanotechnology spending across five \nagencies adding up to over $800 million.\n\n[[Page S987]]\n\n  The President chose to hold a formal signing ceremony at the White \nHouse on this bill, and this is unusual for a bill dealing with \nresearch and development legislation. The White House press release for \nthe signing ceremony noted that the President had previously requested \na 10-percent increase in nanotechnology funding for the 2004 budget. In \nthe fiscal year 2005 budget request, after the signing ceremony, after \nthe photo opportunity, the President asked for a 3-percent increase for \nthe national nanotechnology initiative as calculated by the Office of \nManagement and Budget.\n  Before we passed the legislation, he asked for a 10-percent increase. \nAfter we passed the legislation, he asked for a 3-percent increase. \nWhen you compare the President's nanotechnology request for fiscal year \n2005 to the authorized levels that he signed into law, it turns out \nthat he has requested $200 million less for nanotechnology R in the \nbudget that he sent us on the February 2, compared to the authorization \nthat was signed a few months earlier.\n  Finally, there is a total disconnect between science and the \nadministration's plans for the space program. At the same time that the \nPresident is cutting and terminating or failing to fully fund R \nprograms with demonstrated effectiveness in creating jobs and wealth in \nthe country, he is proposing a manned Moon-Mars initiative at NASA. \nThat is likely to yield some benefit to the Nation. There is a lot of \ndebate about how much benefit.\n  Most of the alleged technology spinoffs of past space exploration \nactivities have not been as great as was advertised. We did not invent \nTeflon or Velcro or even Tang, as part of the space program, contrary \nto the belief of many.\n  To pay for the new Moon-Mars initiative, the President proposes to \ntake funds from other parts of NASA during the next few years. Beyond \nthat, future Presidents will have to direct substantial funds to manned \nspace fight in order to keep the program on schedule.\n  We have already seen the first wrongheaded move at NASA in the area \nof diverting resources and that is the proposed abandonment of the \nHubbel space telescope, which is one of the premier assets of NASA at \nthis time. The Hubbel telescope is still in its prime. It is capable of \ncontinuing to make major discoveries about our universe and its \nformation. The proposal to abandon the Hubbel telescope to find money \nto plan for a manned mission to Mars is a clear example of the low \nvalue that seemingly is placed on real science by the administration.\n  Because of the outcry from the scientific community and from some \ncolleagues in the Congress, notably Senator Mikulski of Maryland, this \nproposal is now getting a second review, but it is too soon to say that \nit will, in fact, be withdrawn. The fact that this termination was \nproposed in the first place illustrates the lack of priority given to \nscience in the administration's thinking about our Nation's future.\n  There are other policies as well that this administration has put \nforward related to science and technology that are also deleterious to \nour future, just as these cutbacks in funding are, to which I have \nreferred.\n  One example is the visa and other immigration restrictions that have \nbeen put in place over the past 2 years related to science and \nengineering students in this country. Foreign-born students coming to \nthis country have for decades been an important asset to the United \nStates. After completing their training, many have stayed here to make \nsignificant contributions to both basic science and innovation. They \nare a great source of strength in our innovation system and to our \ncountry.\n  We have only to look at the current Director of the National \nInstitutes of Health, Dr. Zerhouni, who was born in Algeria and came to \nthe United States in his early twenties to train in diagnostic \nradiology at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. Today, in the name \nof increasing our national security, we are making it extremely \ndifficult for the best and brightest foreign students to come to the \nUnited States and be educated and to remain in this country and become \ncitizens as Dr. Zerhouni was able to do.\n  Instead, the effect of our policies and the ham-handed way we are \nimplementing those policies is driving away from the United States some \nof the scientists and engineers who want to come here to build a better \nlife for themselves and for our society. This is an issue we need to \nlook at seriously, and we need to begin to make rational decisions with \nregard to it.\n  The end result of these policies that have been implemented today is \nthat the brightest students from around the world will increasingly \nchoose non-U.S. educational institutions for their advanced education, \nand major scientific meetings will increasingly take place outside the \nUnited States. Our policies could have the effect of strengthening the \ninnovation systems in other countries. As a result, we might well be \nencouraging high-wage job growth to take place overseas instead of the \nUnited States.\n  What can we do about these issues? We in Congress can do several \nthings. Let me mention a few.\n  First, Congress can put more pressure on the President to beef up the \nWhite House Office of Science and Technology Policy, or OSTP. One of \nthe basic reasons there seems to be so little leadership on science and \ntechnology issues coming out of the White House may be that the Office \nof Science and Technology Policy appears to be significantly and \nseverely understaffed. The current Science Advisor is authorized under \nlaw to have six high-level deputies and most previous Science Advisors \nwere extremely well qualified people in all of those positions. Under \nthis administration, only two of those six positions have been filled. \nNo attempt was made to adjust that staffing strategy after the events \nof 9/11.\n  Clearly, this is an issue that deserves attention. The President's \nScience Advisor appears to have spent the bulk of his energy on \nterrorism-related issues since 9/11 with the result that the overall \nhealth of our science and technical foundations has not gotten the \nattention it otherwise could have received from a fully functioning \nOSTP.\n  A second action item we could address in Congress is require the \nPresident to actually prepare and make public a science and technology \npolicy. We have a lot of speeches about how we need a national energy \npolicy in the country. Why don't we need a national technology policy? \nHaving such a document is not a panacea, but the discipline of having \nto sit down and write such a document will force the White House to \ngive some thought and examination to the technological opportunities \nand revolutions we face and on which we are in danger of missing out. \nPrevious Presidents have had explicit policies in this area. The value \nof such policies has only increased in recent years.\n\n  A third action we can take in preparing this new budget resolution is \nto insist that the entire Federal science and technology budget get \nbetter and more unified consideration. It would be valuable to have \nsome joint hearings across the relevant committees in the Senate on the \noverall shape of our science and technology spending. It might be worth \nconsidering whether the functional structure of the budget itself \nshould be revised to put the entire Federal S budget in one place so \nthat there is more transparency as to what the real trends are in the \nnational budget for science and technology.\n  A final action item I would mention today is Congress needs to take a \nstrong role in resisting the cuts that are being proposed by this \nPresident to the research and development budget, particularly to \nprograms such as the Advanced Technology Program. Frankly, instead of \nterminating the ATP, we should be looking to duplicate its strategies \nand successes in other Federal agencies.\n  For example, both in the Department of Energy and in the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, we could benefit from having programs \nstructured along the lines of the Advanced Technology Program as part \nof the overall mix of programs in each agency to spur the development \nof new technology.\n  One thing I hope Congress does not do is what the administration \nunfortunately has done; that is, to lose focus on where the real source \nof our future national wealth and high-wage job creation opportunities \nlie. Our future economic security crucially depends on innovation and \ngenius as reflected in our\n\n[[Page S988]]\n\nscientists and engineers, particularly universities and major \nlaboratories that are supported by the Federal Government. Our long-\nterm economic future depends upon us making well-reasoned choices about \nwhat our real priorities are, and science and technology needs to be \nrecognized as a priority that it in fact is for the country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I want to take a few moments to respond to \nthe Senator from New Mexico and some of the thoughts and ideas he has \npresented. I appreciate his interest in this topic and his interest in \nscience and technology. But I strongly disagree with some of the \nconclusions he draws.\n  I think the reason for some of those conclusions is that all too \noften when Members of the House or the Senate talk about issues of \nscience and technology, we assume that all programs having to do with \nscience, technology, or research that carry that label in the Federal \nGovernment are all created equal; that they all have the same goals, \nmotives, and effects in areas of science or research and the same \neffect on our economy. They simply do not. I think it is important that \nwe draw a distinction between the various types of research and \ntechnology programs that have been discussed.\n  The Senator from New Mexico mentioned NASA's program. He touched very \nbriefly on National Science Foundation programs, many of which fund \nsome of the nanotechnology initiatives. He mentioned the Advanced \nTechnology Program, and that in particular is the one I wish to talk \nabout.\n  If there is one program in the Federal Government that ought not to \nbe expanded, it is the Advanced Technology Program. It is for the \nreasons that are described or listed in the description read by the \nSenator from New Mexico. He described a program that invests in or \nsubsidizes commercial research for private companies to develop new \nproducts to sell in the market. This isn't investing in research that \nsubsidizes or supports basic physics or chemistry or computational \nmathematics. This is new product development for private--and in most \ncases profitable--companies. The description he read of their \ncommercial applications means that someone somewhere has to assess the \nvalue of these new products. I think the description also mentioned the \nrisk involved.\n  Those who have worked in manufacturing, engineering, and product \ndevelopment understand there are risks involved in developing new \nproducts. But there are also rewards to be gained. That is why many of \nthese companies are quite profitable.\n  What this program in particular--not all federally funded research, \nand certainly not the work of the National Science Foundation that \nprovides support for physics and chemistry and computational \nmathematics but the advanced technology program--is doing is \nsubsidizing product development for private sector companies. That \nnaturally begs the question, What companies? What companies are \nbenefiting from these subsidies? As I said, they are profitable. But \nthese are companies that have competitors. That means someone in the \nFederal Government--a man or woman somewhere in the Federal \nGovernment--is looking at a number of different firms in a given \nindustry and picking one or two to provide a taxpayer-funded subsidy \nfor the development of a new product that they are going to sell in the \nmarketplace and make money from.\n  The Federal Government doesn't get an equity position. We don't get \nroyalties. We are not benefiting from the fruit of these subsidies, but \nwe are certainly taking the taxpayers' money from families who might be \nearning $30,000, $40,000, or $50,000 a year--middle income or low \nincome. We are taking their tax money and giving it to some private \ncorporation to subsidize their new product development. That is simply \nwrong. It does not matter if there is a merit review. It does not \nmatter if the man or woman or the board evaluating these programs is \nbeing very thoughtful about it and very judicious in trying to be fair \nand balanced and pick the right technology or the most promising \ntechnology.\n\n  It is wrong to be subsidizing the product development of a private \ncompany selling its goods into the marketplace, trying to make a \nprofit. It is certainly not an efficient way to run an economy. It \ncertainly is not fair to those competitors who are selling similar \nproducts who have to compete with the company getting the big \ngovernment subsidy or the small government subsidy. It does not matter \nto me if they get $100,000 or $200,000 or $2 million. It certainly is \nnot the role of the Federal Government to try to manipulate or \nmicromanage markets for commercial products. That is not the role of \nthe Federal Government.\n  I do not take issue with a lot of the concern and interest shown in \nencouraging our children to dedicate themselves to areas of science or \ntechnology or mathematics. I certainly enjoyed math and science as a \nstudent, and although I don't know how well I performed, I performed \nwell enough to go to engineering school and work at least at one time \nin the real world helping to develop new products and helping to bring \nthem to market. Maybe it is that personal experience, having worked at \nthe very type of firm that may be applying to the Federal Government \nfor these subsidies, that makes me so concerned this is not the right \nrole for the Federal Government. This is not the best way to spend \ntaxpayers' money.\n  That is precisely the reason the administration has said we ought not \nto be spending $150 million in this way. We can find a better use for \nthis money. We can find a better way to utilize it for the public good \nin a way that does not, in my opinion, sap our economic strength by \ntrying to manipulate or micromanage these markets.\n  There are many areas of the Federal Government where we might be \nproviding support--through the National Science Foundation, through the \nNational Institutes of Health--the basic research in medicine or \nphysics or chemistry or mathematics or some of the other areas I \nmentioned which might be very worthwhile, to expand our understanding \nin these areas of basic science and mathematics. But helping some \ncompany develop a new air conditioning system or new control system or \nwrite a new software code they can sell into the marketplace is not the \nway to do it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me respond briefly to the comments \nof my colleague. I respect his background and knowledge in engineering \nand science. He is, I believe, the only qualified engineer we have \nserving in the Senate at this point. I certainly respect that.\n  I believe strongly the Advanced Technology Program which he has \ndiscussed is a very good use of taxpayer dollars. It is not, as he \ndescribes it, subsidizing product development by individual companies. \nIt is, in fact, assisting with generic, broad-based, high-risk, \nprecompetitive technology development.\n  I suggest to my colleague much of our ability to compete in world \nmarkets depends upon our remaining world leaders in the various generic \ntechnologies we are talking about. In microelectronics, in \nnanotechnology, in a whole range of areas, we need to have Government \nsupport for continued development of generic technologies so our \ncompanies can, in fact, pick up on that and hopefully be competitive in \nthe world markets. That is what has happened in biotechnology.\n\n  Maybe the genome project is a terrible use of taxpayer dollars, \nfunding the development of the genome product. There are a lot of \ncommercial benefits coming out of that and many more in the future. But \nthat was a government-funded research effort, and that was an extremely \ngood investment. That is one of many examples.\n  The Advance Technology Program--and I do not have all the examples \nwith me today, but I will bring them to the Senate in the days ahead. \nBut to say the rest of the world can do what it wants in the way of \npursuing generic-enabling, precompetitive technologies, we are doing \nnothing in those areas, is shortsighted in the extreme. Essentially, \nthat is what this administration has done. We do not want an Advanced \nTechnology Program in this country. The Japanese can do what they want, \nthe Europeans can do what they want, the Chinese can do what they want, \nalong with every other major country.\n\n[[Page S989]]\n\n  I just returned 2 months ago from a trip to Taiwan. I urge my \ncolleague to go to Taiwan--maybe he has been to Hsinchu Science Park \nnear Taipei--and talk to them about how it is inappropriate for \ngovernment to be involved in any way assisting in the development of \nprecompetitive technology that might benefit some of these companies. \nThey do not understand what language you are talking in that kind of \ndiscussion.\n  We are in a severe competition with the rest of the world to remain \nthe world leader in science and technology. The advanced technology \nprogram is an essential part of us maintaining that leadership. It is \nwrongheaded for this administration in this day and time to be coming \nto the Congress and saying, let's eliminate this program. Sure, we want \nhigh-wage jobs to be created, but the answer to that has been, Let's \ncut taxes some more.\n  That is not an economic strategy that is going to get the job done. \nWe need various elements of an economic strategy. One of those is to \nremain the world leader in generic precompetitive technology \ndevelopment. That is what the Advanced Technology Program is intended \nto do. I strongly favor continued and increased funding of it.\n  We have a basic disagreement on this issue. I wanted that on the \nrecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. I appreciate the comments of the Senator from New Mexico.\n  To reiterate what I hope I was clear in saying before, I am not \ntalking about National Science Foundation funding, which was the \nfunding principally used to support the development of the human genome \nproject. I have been quite supportive of the NSF funding and the \nNational Institutes of Health funding research, which is where the \nhuman genome funds came from.\n  Talking about the Advanced Technology Program, I am not quite sure \nwhat ``precompetitive'' means. I would like to use the definition that \nis just behind the Senator from New Mexico. It says ``commercial \npotential.'' That means products that are commercially viable that will \nbe sold in the marketplace, in a competitive marketplace, in that \ndescription behind the Senator from New Mexico.\n  It says the grantees of this program are businesses--businesses and \njoint R partnerships that are funded by, I assume, I hope, American \nbusinesses. In fact, at one time some of the largest grantees of this \nprogram were those in the automotive industry, automotive manufacturing \nindustry. We were using these ATP funds for the partnership for the \nnext generation vehicle. This was an initiative driven originally by \nVice President Al Gore at the time to develop a hybrid car, hybrid \nelectric and combustion engine. After spending about $2 billion in all \nwith the Advanced Technology Program, that effort was abandoned. It \nsimply is a case in point as to why it is not a good idea to take \ntaxpayer money and try to subsidize the product development--in this \ncase, of cars--that is a product sold in the marketplace, and in a \ncompetitive marketplace at that.\n\n  One final anecdote, and I think it is an important anecdote. The \nSenator from New Mexico mentioned Taiwan. I have been to Taiwan before; \nnot to this particular office park. I do not believe in a national \neconomic policy that says: Let's do what the Japanese are doing. Let's \ndo what the Germans are doing.\n  In Germany right now they have over 10 percent unemployment. In Japan \nright now they are still in the throes of a deflationary spiral and a \nstock market collapse that began several years ago.\n  I do not want to be Japan. I do not want to be Germany. I want to be \nAmerica. I want the strongest, most competitive, most vibrant economy \nin the world. That is what we have today. I do not want to lose that, \ncertainly. But if we look back just a little bit, back to the late \n1980s, industrial policy wonks within the Senate and the U.S. \nGovernment were insisting if we wanted to be a competitive economy, we \nhad to subsidize the development of the high-definition TV standard, \nand they did not talk about putting $100 million or $200 million or \n$150 million, as we have in the Advanced Technology Program today, into \nsubsidizing the development of a TV standard. They were talking about \nbillions--$2 billion, $5 billion, $10 billion--to subsidize the \ndevelopment of a commercial application.\n  Fortunately, the United States did not do that. But Japan, the model \ncited by the Senator from New Mexico, did do it. They put roughly $20 \nbillion of their federal taxpayer resources into the development of \nthat commercial standard. As a result, they have a high-definition TV \nstandard that cannot rival the standard that was developed by the \nprivate sector, the competitive marketplace here in the United States.\n  It is a small example.\n  We might be able to point to an example where a technology or venture \nin ATP did result in a good commercial product that enabled the owners \nof that product to make a lot of money. But, as I often point out to my \nconstituents, if you let me spend $150 million a year, I can certainly \ncreate a few jobs with it; the question is, is it the role of the \nFederal Government. Should we be micromanaging private sector, \nprofitable companies in the private marketplace? Should we be \nsubsidizing one company at the expense of its competitors? Is it the \nright thing to do? I think in this case it simply is not.\n  I yield the floor and very much appreciate the Senator from New \nMexico engaging in this discussion and difference of opinion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority whip.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I first of all extend my appreciation and my \napologies to the Senator from Wyoming, Mr. Thomas, for allowing me to \ngo before him. I will be as brief as possible. I wanted the discussion \nto be in keeping with what has been said by the Senator from New Mexico \nand the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  I am not a scientist, but I am a historian. I understand history. I \nknow, for example, in 1844 Congress was approached by a man who said: I \nwant to revolutionize the communications systems in this country. He \nasked Congress to appropriate $40,000 for an experiment he did not have \nthe wherewithal to do. He had been trying for many years to get the \nmoney to do this.\n  The experiment was to build a telegraph line between Washington, DC \nand Baltimore, MD. For $40,000 they did it. The Federal Government did \nnot ever have to put another penny into that project. It revolutionized \nthe way we communicated in America--the telegraph system. The Federal \nGovernment did the right thing by doing the research and development on \nthis issue.\n  Let's fast forward now more than 100 years from 1844 when two \nscientists from MIT, by the name of Danby and Powell, were stuck in \ntraffic in New York. They were both professors at MIT, scientists. They \nsaid: This is ridiculous. We shouldn't be stuck in traffic like this. \nWe should figure something out that would stop this.\n  They went back to the laboratories, and they, within a short period \nof time, invented magnetic levitation, which is the ability of these \nhuge trainlike vehicles to speed through the air, but the vehicle is \nless than a quarter of an inch off the guideway. It goes 300 miles an \nhour.\n  The Federal Government, the United States of America, for 5 years \npaid for research and development for this new technology. There were \ncost-cutting issues that came forward and it was eliminated. There was \nno more research and development. But the Germans and the Japanese \npicked up from where we left off, and now they are in the process of \nfinalizing their experimentation of magnetic levitation.\n  We are going to have magnetic levitation in this country, no question \nabout it. It is only a question of when. The bill that is now before \nthis body will spend hundreds of millions of dollars on magnetic \nlevitation. The bill before that did not spend that much. It is going \nto happen, but we are going to have to import the equipment and the \ntechnology from Germany and Japan.\n  I believe the Senator is right. I believe the Federal Government has \nto be very careful in picking and choosing where we help with research \nand development on a scientific project, but we have an obligation, I \nbelieve, to the taxpayers of this country to develop the telegraph or \nmagnetic levitation.\n  I underscore the need for this and applaud and congratulate the \nSenator from New Mexico for his usual farsightedness.\n\n[[Page S990]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me just continue, if I can, for \nanother 2 minutes before yielding to my colleague. I promise it will be \nvery short.\n  I thank the Senator from Nevada very much for the examples he cited. \nI think there are many other examples, and in the coming days and weeks \nI will try to bring some of those to the floor, as I am sure my \ncolleague from Nevada will.\n  The truth is, we would not have an Internet if it were not for \nGovernment-funded technology development. The President himself has \nidentified some areas where he believes we need to put additional \nresources into research and development--developing hydrogen-operated \nvehicles, for example.\n  There are a great many areas where the Government does have a \nlegitimate role to play in underwriting generic, precompetitive \ntechnology our companies can then take to be competitive and remain \ncompetitive. That is what the Advanced Technology Program has done. \nThere are many examples we can point to over the years of successes \nthey have had, and we will get those examples out for the Senate.\n  But it is shortsighted in the extreme for us to be saying, in this \nday and time, when we are worried about high-wage job creation in this \ncountry, that the way to start dealing with that is to eliminate this \nkind of program, to eliminate our support for science and technology \ndevelopment in the Department of Commerce. That is a very shortsighted \napproach. I hope this Congress will not agree with this President and \ngo along with this kind of cut.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor. Again, I thank my \ncolleague, Senator Thomas, for his courtesy in allowing us to continue \nthis debate as long as we have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I enjoyed listening to the debate.\n  I do rise to talk some more about the issue that is before us, the \nissue we have been talking about now for 10 days, and that hopefully we \nwill be able to complete within the next couple of days, and that, of \ncourse, is the highway transportation infrastructure bill that is now \nbefore us.\n  I thank the chairman of the EPW Committee and the ranking member and \nthe staff for continuing to move forward with this important bill.\n  Sometimes we take for granted what is out there, whether it be \nelectricity--we have been working on the electric bill--whether it is \nenergy. Because it is there, we just sort of forget all that goes into \nmaking sure it is there.\n  But our previous transportation infrastructure bill, the \nTransportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, expired on September 30 \nof the past year. Now we are nearly half a year beyond the bill \nexpiring to take care of our infrastructure needs. For some time, then, \nthe transportation system has been operating under a 5-month extension, \nwhich expires at the end of this month, by the way, and which doesn't \nfund nearly to the present needs because it is a CR from before.\n\n  So the infrastructure is in great need. All of us recognize that. \nThere is an increasing use of it, increasing numbers of cars on the \nroad, increasing numbers of trucks.\n  Our whole economy depends on this transportation infrastructure. The \nInterstate Highway system is almost 50 years old. Thirty-two percent of \nour major roads are in poor or mediocre condition. You can see that, \nparticularly when we have had the rain and the storms, you drive around \nand bump into the potholes.\n  But more importantly, we don't have the kind of expansion to handle \nthe increased traffic. Twenty-nine percent of our bridges are \nstructurally deficient, functionally obsolete. Thirty-six percent of \nthe Nation's urban rail vehicles and maintenance facilities are in \nsubstandard condition. Twenty-nine of the Nation's bus fleet and \nmaintenance facilities are substandard or in poor condition. We really \nhave a challenge with one of the most important aspects of our economy \nbeing in poorer shape, certainly, than we would like to see it or even \nimagine that it is.\n  I am very pleased that we are working on this bill. I happen to be a \nmember of the EPW Committee as well as the Finance Committee. Those are \nthe two main committees involved. I have been involved for some time--\nin fact, 6 years ago I was involved in the previous program from the \nEPW Committee. I feel strongly about this issue, very strongly about it \nin terms of the infrastructure, very strongly about it in terms of the \njobs that it creates. Quite frankly, it creates more jobs more quickly \nthan any other kind of activity we could undertake.\n  We are in the process of seeking to get that resolved, of course. \nThis legislation would result in thousands of jobs. In my State of \nroughly half a million people, one of the smallest States in the \ncountry, 20,000-plus jobs mean a lot. We would have those very quickly. \nIn fact, for every $1 billion in highway construction, we can expect \n47,000 new jobs to occur. This means creating opportunities for people \nto work.\n  In my State, again, we have nearly 20,000 people who are employed as \ntruckers and move more than 31 million tons of manufactured freight and \nearn more than $674 million in wages. So this is part of the economy \nthat is impacted and affected. Without good, safe roads, of course, \nthese people can't get their jobs done.\n  The highway system is almost 50 years old. You don't think about all \nthe things that are involved in that. It is terribly expensive to have \nroads fixed. Last year we had 20 or 30 miles of roads being fixed over \nthe mountain into Yellowstone Park. This is a U.S. road. This is an \ninterstate highway that people were using. Of course, it is very \nexpensive. So there are a lot of dollars involved in doing this. But we \ncan't allow these kinds of things to continue to deteriorate.\n  I just came from a meeting for an hour or so with the Director of the \nNational Park Service. I happen to be chairman of the Park Service \nSubcommittee. One of the issues important to the Park Service is \nmaintenance of highways in national parks. Of course, here again it is \nvery expensive but absolutely necessary to have it done. There is a \ngreat deal of discussion about what we ought to do. The expenses are \nhigh. We are all concerned about the budget and the deficit, of course. \nWe want to work to change that. But we have had that in mind as we have \ngone along on this whole program.\n\n  Of course, the basic source for funds for highway funding is the tax \non gasoline that each of us pays, 18.5 cents each time we put in a \ngallon of gas. That goes into this fund. It goes into the fund for \nhighways, partially for mass transportation as well. The funding \nactually was done in the Finance Committee, and there has been a \nconsiderable amount of talk about the fact that there was some sort of \ntrick being pulled in order to get money in there that didn't belong \nthere. Quite frankly, I followed it as closely as I could. I keep \nhearing these incorrect allegations.\n  I encourage critics to read the Finance Committee title. Under the \ncommittee title, the highway trust fund will maintain more of the \nexcise taxes that were intended to go into that fund originally but \nhave not been there. This accomplishes partial elimination for the \nethanol blend of fuels. These fuel users now pay the full excise tax, \nand the trust fund under this plan will receive the money. It has not \nin the past. The benefits will be taken as a tax credit against the \ngeneral fund as are all other energy production incentives.\n  Likewise, the trust fund will retain excise taxes collected from \ncertain users such as State and local governments using the highways \nand paying into that fund. Currently, these users get a refund. Under \nthe committee amendment, the refund is not charged to the highway trust \nfund. What we have done is made some changes in the funding that should \nhave been going into the trust fund but has not been going into the \ntrust fund, and then finding some others to replace these so that there \nis not a reduction in the general fund but that the highway trust fund \nhas more body to it.\n  The committee changes have been called gimmicks. We hear the \nallegation that the Finance Committee used accounting gimmicks. This is \nunfair and incorrect. What the Finance Committee did do was ensure that \nthe trust fund keeps more of the excise tax, which is what it was \ndesigned to do in the first place.\n\n[[Page S991]]\n\n  Then, for instance, the Finance Committee recognized that the trust \nfund should earn interest on the balance. It is a huge amount of money, \nand the interest is a significant amount. It has not gone into the \ntrust fund in the past. It would do that.\n  So there are a number of aspects that have been changed here. We find \na good deal of complaint on the floor that these were gimmicks and \ncriticisms of the Finance Committee. Unfortunately, interestingly \nenough, the Commerce Committee is also a part of this. They have been \nable to spend $7 billion in their programs, but they don't ever mention \nthat. All they do is complain about what the Finance Committee is \ndoing.\n  I can't emphasize enough the need to move this bill and to move it \nnow. This idea that we would have a CR for a year simply doesn't deal \nwith the issues we have, the problems we have, keeping up this \ninfrastructure in the way it needs to be kept up. We have solved these \nissues. What we need to do is pass this bill this week and go into \nconference committee. Get the House to do what they are going to do \nwith it, go into the conference committee, work with the House and \nthe White House and with the Senate and come up with a bill that is \nappropriate for everyone and will be accepted by others. That is the \nsystem we have.\n\n  Increasingly, if someone disagrees with the system, instead of \ndebating and discussing their differences, they just look for ways to \nhold up the bill. Quite frankly, that is a high price to pay for all \nAmericans to not have these jobs, to not have this infrastructure kept \nup, to not be able to do what is needed on one of the most important \naspects of our economy. We have the opportunity to do that.\n  I am certainly hopeful that we can come to some agreement. No one in \nthis Senate is more concerned than I am about the spending level. I \nthink you have to take a look at what we are seeking to do to balance \nthe budget, to reduce the deficit, and to help increase the economy.\n  These are the issues we have been dealing with. Of course, in \naddition to that, as a cause of the deficit, we had September 11. So it \nis not easy. But we can do it. I certainly hope we do and that we move \nforward as quickly as possible to be able to do this.\n  I yield to my friend from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. THOMAS. Absolutely.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, the Senator made a very good point about the \nneed to move this bill. He raised the question about a 1-year \nextension. Is it the understanding of my colleague that the major \nprojects that would generate the kind of work that is needed to improve \nour Nation's infrastructure, the major highway and bridge projects, \ncannot be undertaken on a 1-year extension because these are multiyear \nprojects and they need a multiyear extension?\n  Mr. THOMAS. The Senator is absolutely right. These are large \nprojects. They are contracts. They take a while. If you are going on a \n1-year extension, our highway department, for example, couldn't put the \ncontracts out on some of the most important jobs because they wouldn't \nbe finished in that length of time and they don't have the dough. It is \nthat simple. That is a very important aspect to continuing to resolve \nthis question now.\n  Mr. BOND. If the Senator would further yield, I know the Senator is \nfrom a Western State in the north, and the time during which \nsignificant highway construction can go forward is limited by the \nweather.\n  What is the timeframe for summer construction in your State?\n  Mr. THOMAS. Well, of course, in order to have summer construction, it \nis necessary that now the Transportation Department be able to know \nwhat their funds are going to be, what their ability to contract will \nbe, so that they can do it very soon, so that these contractors can get \nin place in April and begin to work for a longer summer. If they have \nnot gotten the contract until late in the summer, they are all faced \nwith a couple of months of work, and they go into winter, which they \ncannot do. Seasonal is very important. We have a chance to take \nadvantage of the summer construction system now.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask that question because some people \ntalked about a 3- or 4-month extension. I wonder if my colleague agrees \nthat that simply would miss an entire season, even in Missouri, where \nour weather may not be quite as harsh but we would not be able to \nreally undertake any construction projects. Is that similar to the \ncondition in the Senator's State?\n  Mr. THOMAS. Absolutely. We have heard a great deal from our \ntransportation people before Christmas, wanting this. This was supposed \nto have been done in September, when the fiscal year began. They wanted \nto be in to make the contracts then so that these contractors could get \nready. It is going to be quite close now. Still, if we can move in \nFebruary, it will give us a pretty good shot.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator from Wyoming yield for a question?\n  Mr. THOMAS. Certainly.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I think the picture here says it all. We \nhave on the floor now two of the majority party and two of the minority \nparty, representing diverse areas of this country, including Wyoming, \nMissouri, Vermont, and Nevada, and I also see my friend from New Jersey \nin the Chamber. Each State is so reliant and dependent upon doing \nsomething about this highway bill that all of us in the Chamber are \ndoing everything we can to move this ball down the field.\n  The State of Wyoming is an example that doesn't have a lot of people \ncoming there to pay enough money into the trust fund to take care of \nthe needs of that great big State. Not only is it large area-wise, but \nhaving spent some time there myself in the cold winter, I know \nmaintaining the roads in Wyoming, compared to a place such as Nevada, \nis more expensive because of the tremendous variation in temperatures.\n  My point is that this legislation is bipartisan. It is legislation \nthat is for every part of the country, as evidenced on the floor.\n  I was speaking here, off the record, with the distinguished Senator \nfrom Missouri. We are going to pass this legislation now in a matter of \nhours. It is imperfect, but it is a really good piece of legislation to \nallow the director of the Department of Highways in the State of Nevada \nto have some ability to look down the road, as they have a continuum \nfor money, so we can complete projects we have to do in Nevada. We are \na big State area-wise. We have problems in the southern part of the \nState that are totally different from in the northern part of the \nState. It rarely freezes in the southern part, but in the northern \npart, for instance, we have Wild Horse Reservoir that, on \nvarious occasions, is the coldest place in the country. So we have our \nown problems, as do Missouri, New Jersey, Vermont, and Wyoming. I am so \nhappy there has been this cooperation on this bill. I hope it sets a \ntone for the rest of the year. It is a Presidential election year and \nsome Senate seats are up.\n\n  For the first bill this year, I think the distinguished majority \nleader and the distinguished Democratic leader picked a good one to \nshow that we can work together on matters and set aside our partisan \ndifferences. We have done it on this bill. I appreciate the comments of \nthe Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I thank the Senator.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, very briefly, this is a difficult bill, as \nthe distinguished Senator from Nevada has said. There is a lot of work \nthat goes into it. If anybody was completely 100 percent happy with it, \nwe would not have done our job, because there are too many interests. \nThe only way to accommodate them is to work on a bipartisan basis.\n  I want to say this while the Senator from Nevada is here. The Senator \nfrom Nevada and the Senator from Vermont and, obviously, my good friend \nfrom Wyoming, on both sides of the aisle, with Senator Inhofe as \nchairman of the committee, have worked well together, including the \noccupant of the chair. This is probably one of the most important \neconomic stimulus infrastructure bills we are going to act on this \nyear, or maybe for quite a few years. I hope we can get a solid vote to \nmove forward tomorrow. There is a lot more work to be done, as I \nbelieve several have already said. We are waiting for the House to act. \nWhen the House acts, we will take it and work with them and we will \ntake into consideration what the White House has said to\n\n[[Page S992]]\n\nsee if we can--and we must--craft a good bill that takes care of the \ncrying needs of infrastructure.\n  I have said before on this floor so many times that it is not just a \nquestion of convenience, of cutting down on idling time, it is a \nquestion of long-term economic growth as well as immediate jobs. In \nMissouri, it is a question of saving lives by having adequate highways. \nWhen we have two-lane highways carrying 15,000 or 20,000 cars a day, \nthat is too many. We should have divided highways. The fact that we \ndon't means that wherever you travel in Missouri on heavily traveled \ntwo-lane roads, you see little white crosses where grieving families \nand friends have indicated the place where a loved one was lost.\n  This bill isn't going to solve all the problems in Missouri. If we \npass this bill, many of the problems in Missouri and around the country \nwill be solved. I urge my colleagues to work together and move forward \non the bill. Our staffs are working now on a cooperative basis with a \nvery large number of amendments that have been filed to see how many we \ncan accept, how we can move it along.\n  Tomorrow is going to be a very busy day. We will try to accept as \nmany amendments as we can on a bipartisan basis. If you want more \nmoney, please tell us where you are going to find it because we are \nstrapped for money and major new spending sources without revenue are \ngoing to be difficult to accommodate.\n  Within those parameters, I urge everybody to work together. The \nfiling deadline for first-degree amendments is past. I know what we \nhave in front of us. I hope we can resolve as many as possible.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his statement. I \nwant to reassure all of our Members that we will be working together \nand have been working together, and we will find a solution to many of \nthose amendments. We won't unless they are filed. The sooner they are \nfiled, the sooner we may even have a chance to get home for the \nweekend. That might be incentive for some.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to discuss an amendment that \nwas cosponsored by Senator DeWine from Ohio. We would like to have had \nthis considered in this important transportation bill.\n  I want to say this to those who are managing the bill and who have \ndeveloped it. We see a piece of legislation that has a lot of good \naspects to it. My State of New Jersey is doing better in this bill than \nit has on occasions in the past, with some adjustments here and there \nthat give us some more funding in transit as well as highways. We \nappreciate that.\n  The subject we want to discuss is one that deals with safety, which \nis an integral part of this legislation and certainly should be, and \nthat subject is the result of drunk driving.\n  Drunk driving cost the lives of 17,419 people in 2002. It is an \nincrease for the third straight year in a row. This is unacceptable in \nour society by any measure. This is evidence that we are not doing \nenough to win the war on drunk driving. In 2000, I was proud to team up \nwith Senator DeWine to standardize our Nation's drunk driving blood \nalcohol concentration level at .08. That is a critical step toward \nreducing drunk driving, but that measure alone will not end this \ncrisis.\n\n  During my career of public service, I promoted many legislative \ninitiatives to help curb drunk driving in our country. In addition to \n.08, I wrote the law that established a minimum legal drinking age of \n21. Most Americans have responded to these laws by drinking responsibly \nand reducing fatalities and injuries on our highways.\n  At one point it was estimated that we saved 1,000 young people a year \nfrom dying on the highways as a result of that change in the age of \ndrinking.\n  The most feared category of drunk drivers who have failed to mend \ntheir ways is also the most shameful: the hardcore drunk drivers. These \nare the problem drinkers. These are the ones who ignore the dangers and \nhave no concern for the safety of those of us on the road, including \nour families and our friends.\n  It is estimated that hardcore drunk drivers are responsible for as \nmany as 40 percent of all alcohol-related deaths on the road, and that \nmeans about 6,000 to 8,000 people a year die at the hands of a hardcore \ndrunk driver. That is not an acceptable situation.\n  Many of us have terrible, tragic stories involving lost loved ones \ndue to drunk driving crashes. A young woman on my staff recounted a \nmoment in her life when she was a teenager, when five of her close \nfriends, all juniors in high school from southern New Jersey were hit \nby an SUV. Four were killed and one was badly injured. This was in \nbroad daylight at 3 o'clock in the afternoon. A heavily intoxicated 29-\nyear-old woman had plowed her SUV into the girl's car. One police \nofficer described the scene as ``an explosion with glass everywhere.''\n  The driver of the SUV is what safety experts term a ``higher-risk'' \nor ``hardcore'' drunk driver. In fact, her blood alcohol content was \nfound to be .21 nearly 5 hours after the crash, and usually that \ndiminishes significantly. This is almost three times the legal limit of \n.08. Perhaps the most disturbing part of this story is the fact that \nthis driver had two prior charges of driving while intoxicated in 1991 \nand 1996.\n  Some States have adopted laws that try to get hardcore drunk drivers \noff the road. It is something we heard a lot about when we put in place \nthe .08 blood alcohol concentration standard. They said you have to get \nto the hardcore people; they are the ones who are really dangerous on \nthe road. That is true, but anybody who is impaired while driving is a \nproblem.\n  A TEA-21 program that we put into place resulted in 36 States and the \nDistrict of Columbia passing repeat offender laws, but currently only \n13 States have enhanced penalties based on blood alcohol concentration \nlevels of .15 and above. Thirteen States and our own District of \nColumbia still do not have laws mandating alcohol assessment and \ntreatment by a professional. Fourteen States do not have laws mandating \nthat a drunk driver's vehicle be impounded.\n  We have to take action to keep these hardcore drunk drivers off our \nroads. The costs we pay are too high. We can save thousands of lives by \npassing this bipartisan commonsense amendment that I would like to \noffer along with Senator DeWine.\n  Victims rights groups, such as Mothers Against Drunk Driving, have \nbrought to our attention the need to change our laws to make our roads \nsafer. It is my great pleasure to work with the dedicated, thorough, \nand caring people of MADD.\n\n  This hardcore drunk driving amendment takes advantage of research and \npolicies that have been proven effective to fix what is wrong with this \ncurrent repeat offender program.\n  First, it builds on the excellent work done by Senator Inhofe and \nSenator Jeffords in the bill by allowing the use of ignition \ninterlocks, a popular and effective tool. Forty-two States have laws \nallowing for ignition interlocks to be used so that in case of \nhardships, a conditional license can be granted.\n  Our amendment also fixes the loophole that currently exists to allow \nStates to spend Federal funding designated for driver safety programs \non construction projects. While road construction is certainly a worthy \nambition, this loophole defeats the purpose of the Federal program in \nthe first place and must be addressed.\n  Our amendment cracks down on very high blood alcohol concentration \ndrivers. Drivers with a .15 percent or greater blood alcohol \nconcentration are almost 400 times more likely to be involved in a \nfatal accident than a sober driver.\n  I believe the Federal Government needs to continue strong leadership \nin relation to reducing alcohol-impaired driving. Not all States have \ndealt with this safety crisis in a comprehensive manner. Loopholes \nstill exist, loopholes so large that drunk drivers continue to drive \nright through them.\n  Now is the time to take the next step in getting these hardcore drunk \ndrivers off our roads. I look forward to working with Senator DeWine, \nSenator Dorgan, and Senator Corzine, all of whom joined with me in \ntrying to reduce the 17,000 alcohol-related traffic fatalities that \noccur each year.\n  It is regretful that we cannot have an opportunity to offer our \namendment. It\n\n[[Page S993]]\n\nis relevant and germane to this bill, but not having the chance to \noffer the amendment, frankly, hurts our work and our interests in \nkeeping our highways safer, saving lives wherever we can.\n  This is something I hope we can work out with the managers of the \nbill to see if there isn't something we can do to show that we are \nseriously interested in getting drunk drivers off the road. Remember, \nover 17,000 deaths a year on our highways, 40 percent of which are due \nto the antics of the repeat drunk driver.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before the distinguished Senator from New \nJersey leaves the floor, I want to make this comment. I am sure we all \nwonder, having served in legislative bodies, what has been \naccomplished, what have we been able to point to that we have done that \nchanges the lives of people in our country. Let me say to my friend \nfrom New Jersey, he need not worry about that because his legacy has \nalready been established.\n  I owe so much to the Senator from New Jersey, as does my whole \nfamily, and I speak for most families--I should say the vast majority \nof families in America, many of whom don't realize what the Senator \nfrom New Jersey has done to make their lives more pleasant.\n  When we used to travel back and forth from Las Vegas and Reno to \nWashington with my family--they were little children at the time--my \ndaughter and my boys, especially two of them, could not stand cigarette \nsmoking in an airplane. It really made them physically ill. We would \npacify them and say, well, that is in a different section; do not worry \nabout it. As we know, when one person smoked on an airplane, we all \nsmoked on an airplane. The Senator from New Jersey is more responsible, \nby far, than any other one person, or group of people, for being \npersistent and pushing that there would be no smoking on airplanes. The \nSenator from New Jersey did that.\n  When he started out on this issue, people thought he was tilting \nwindmills. No one believed with the very powerful interests that \nfavored smoking on airplanes, including the airplane owners and, of \ncourse, the cigarette manufacturers, that the Senator from New Jersey \ncould accomplish what he did. But he did.\n  In addition to that, we all owe a debt of gratitude to the Senator \nfrom New Jersey for pushing to make sure all States had a .08 standard \nfor blood alcohol. The Senator from New Jersey did this.\n  The reason I mention these two things that are the legacy--and I have \nonly mentioned a couple of things because they stick out in my mind \nthat the Senator from New Jersey has done, that I know. With the \ntireless efforts of the Senator from New Jersey on the things that he \nbelieves in, that he is talking about, this will get done. This will be \naccomplished for a number of reasons, not the least of which it is the \nright issue but, No. 2, because the Senator from New Jersey is the one \nwho is pushing this.\n  I want the Senator from New Jersey to know how much I--and I speak \nfor millions of Americans--recognize his great contributions to making \nour lives healthier, better, and safer in America.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I take this moment to respond to my \ngood friend from Nevada. He has always been interested in the safety \nand well-being of our people at the basic level, where we can make a \ndifference. Senator Reid from Nevada is always there, and I appreciate \nhis support. I like working with him. When he says this is going to be \ndone, my colleagues can take it to the bank because we are going to \nkeep on working on it.\n  If we ever forget what it is we are talking about today, just \ncontinue to read the papers, and there will be stories about the \nintoxicated driver who went way over the limit and took a life.\n  I will never forget a young woman who came in from Maryland to talk \nto us one day. She was waiting with her daughter for the schoolbus, \nchild in hand. Someone driving a car at 8 in the morning jumped the \ncurb and killed this child whose hand she was holding.\n  Then there was the man in Hawaii who was driving with his wife behind \na car that his son and daughter had rented. They were struck by a drunk \ndriver. It killed them both.\n  These things happen all the time, enough to kill over 17,000 people a \nyear. That means that in less than 4 years, there will be as many \npeople killed on our highways as were killed in Vietnam. So this is not \na trivial thing, and we are going to have to keep on working on it.\n  I am willing to do it, and I know the Senator from Nevada is willing \nto do it. We just have to hope that the opportunity arises.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The minority whip.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from New Jersey was responsible for one of the \nmost memorable debates that I ever was present for in the Senate, and I \nam sure the Senator from New Jersey will remember it. It was a debate \non drunk drivers. The very articulate Dale Bumpers, former Senator from \nArkansas, gave many great speeches but none more memorable than when he \nspoke about his being a law student at Western University and he \nreceived a call from his brother. He knew it was bad news. He did not \nknow how bad it was, but a drunk driver had killed his parents when he \ncrossed over the line.\n  The Senator will also remember the distinguished former chairman of \nthe Budget Committee, now the ranking member of the Budget Committee, \nthe Senator from North Dakota, Kent Conrad, who was made an orphan as a \nlittle boy by a drunk driver who killed his parents.\n  So we have to continually do more to keep these higher-risk drunk \ndrivers off the road. They are a menace to society. In my opinion, the \nonly thing they understand is force, power. They have to be put in \njail. They have to be prevented from driving their cars.\n  As the Senator knows, we are in a parliamentary quagmire and maybe \nthere is a short-lived victory for those who oppose what the Senator is \ntrying to do but it will not last long.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the highway \ntransportation bill which we are on right now. I will discuss basically \ntwo general points. The first has to do with the amount of funding in \nthe bill and the administration position on that matter. Then secondly, \nI will talk a little bit about the funding formula in the bill.\n  As everyone knows, we are talking about a bill that would authorize \nand pay for the highway transportation and mass transit needs of the \ncountry over the next 6 years, financed historically by the gas tax. \nThe 6-year bill that has been offered intends to be more generous than \nthat by taking in some additional revenues, providing a lot more \nfunding, and extending the authorization that currently exists for a \nperiod of 6 years.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of my remarks this \nStatement of Administration Policy be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. KYL. I am quoting now from a February 11, 2004, Statement of \nAdministration Policy from the executive office of the President, \nOffice of Management and Budget. As my colleagues know, these \nStatements of Administration Policy are issued with respect to \nimportant legislation and they set forth the administration's position \non the legislation.\n  After noting that the administration supports enactment of the 6-year \nhighway funding bill, the letter says the following:\n\n       The administration's proposal, as modified by the \n     President's FY 2005 budget, would provide $256 billion over \n     six years, an historically high level of investment for \n     highways and transit. This proposal represents a $45 billion, \n     or 21 percent, increase over the Transportation Equity Act \n     for the 21st Century (TEA-21), the six-year bill enacted in \n     1998.\n\n  The administration goes on in this Statement of Administration Policy \nto say the following:\n\n       The administration believes that surface transportation \n     reauthorization legislation should exhibit spending restraint \n     and adhere to the following three principles.\n\n  Now, let me digress before I state what those principles are. The \nreason\n\n[[Page S994]]\n\nthe administration is talking about spending restraint is because the \nbill that is before us is far larger in its amount of spending than \nwhat the administration's proposal and the President's budget provide \nfor, and it is far larger than is necessary. Frankly, in view of the \nstatus of our excess spending and our Federal budget deficit, it is \nmore than we can afford.\n  Moreover, it is greatly in excess of the funds we collect with the \ngas tax, which in the past has been the funding that has been used to \npay for this highway bill. So this is what the President and the \nadministration is writing in this letter.\n  The administration believes the legislation should exhibit spending \nrestraint and adhere to the following three principles: One, \ntransportation infrastructure spending should not rely on an increase \nin the gas tax or other Federal taxes. Two, transportation \ninfrastructure spending should not be funded through bonding or other \nmechanisms that conceal the true costs to the Federal taxpayers. And \nthree, highway spending should be financed from the highway trust fund, \nnot the general fund of the Treasury.\n  It goes on:\n\n       All spending for highways should be authorized and \n     appropriated from the Trust Fund and derived from taxes \n     imposed on the highway use, thereby maintaining the link \n     between Trust Fund revenues and highway spending.\n\n  Madam President, how does the administration's position and the \narticulation of the three principles under which it believes the bill \nshould be funded compare with what we are considering on the floor \nhere? I am going to go on and quote the administration's \ncharacterization of the legislation on the floor.\n\n       However, the bill pending before the Senate authorizes $262 \n     billion on highway and highway safety, which is $50 billion \n     above the President's request, and $56 billion on mass \n     transit, which is $12 billion above the President's request. \n     In total the Senate bill authorizes $318 billion in spending \n     on highways, highway safety, and mass transit over the next \n     six years, a full $62 billion above the President's request \n     for the same period.\n       The Administration's proposed authorization level of $256 \n     billion over six years is consistent with the three \n     principles listed above. We support a responsible six-year \n     bill and support many of the provisions contained in this \n     legislation. However, we oppose S. 1072 and the pending \n     substitute because their spending levels are too high and \n     they violate these principles discussed above. Accordingly, \n     if legislation that violates these three principles--such as \n     this legislation which authorizes $318 billion--were \n     presented to the President, his senior advisors would \n     recommend that he veto the bill.\n\n  There is more in the letter, but I think you get the gist of it. The \nadministration is trying to tell us it would prefer a bill that, No. 1, \nadheres to the President's budget, to spend no more than $256 billion, \nand, No. 2, does not violate the three sensible funding principles the \nPresident lays out in the bill.\n  But the statement of administration policy notes that the bill before \nthe Senate is a full $62 billion above the President's request, and it \nconcludes in this part by noting that:\n  The administration, therefore, opposes Senate bill S. 1072 because \nthe ``spending levels are too high'' and because ``they violate the \nprinciples discussed above.''\n  And if we end up passing legislation such as this, then the \nPresident's senior advisors will recommend he veto the bill.\n  I think the President is getting the same message the rest of us \nshould be getting from our constituents, the American people: Congress \nand the President have been spending too much money.\n  In defense of the President, he has reached agreements in the past \nyear with the leaders of the House and the Senate over spending limits \nand has said he would not support any legislation--and I presume he \nwould have vetoed legislation--above that level. We have sent him bills \nat those levels. So in that regard, it is not the President's fault.\n  But I take responsibility as a Member of this body, and all of my \ncolleagues should as well, that we as the body that initiates the \nspending proposals and sends them to the President must act more \nresponsibly in ensuring that we do not exceed revenues, that we send \nthe President bills that are fiscally restrained and that will not add \nto our budget deficit.\n\n  Alan Greenspan, the Chairman of the Fed, has made the point many \ntimes in recent months that the biggest threat to our economic growth \nand to our fiscal stability is profligate spending, and he has urged us \nto rein in our appetite for spending.\n  Some of my colleagues on the other side have expressed great dismay \nthat when the Office of Management and Budget was finally able to \ncalculate the cost of the Medicare prescription drug bill from last \nyear, instead of $395 billion of cost over 10 years, as calculated by \nthe Congressional Budget Office, the administration's people found that \nit actually would be far higher than that, over $500 billion.\n  Some of our Democratic friends have said--I gather they seem to \nsuggest that therefore it is the President's fault. The President's \npeople are the folks who found out that the spending was more than the \n$400 billion and have brought that forth and told us that. What should \nwe do?\n  Later on I am going to give my colleagues an opportunity to bring the \nspending back in line with the $400 billion of which they seem so \nenamored. I think that is plenty. I think we can live within that $400 \nbillion limit. So we will all have an opportunity to decide whether we \nreally mean it when we say the spending on that bill should be limited \nto $400 billion over 10 years.\n  My point in digressing from the discussion of the highway bill is to \nnote that there has been a focus on a lot of the spending the Senate \nand House have engaged in recently, and certainly the prescription drug \nand Medicare funding bill is one of the largest. Another we have had \nbefore us is the energy bill, which has a subsidy of about $30 billion. \nThe administration budget request was $8 billion. That is another bill \nthat, were we to pass in excess of $8 billion in subsidies, would \nexceed the administration's request.\n  Here is a third example where the Senate is poised to pass a bill way \nin excess of the President's request. My point is it is not the White \nHouse that is doing the spending, it is the Congress that is passing \nthe bills that have the spending in them. The President is sending us a \nsignal that he is tired of this and his advisors are saying, to be \nprecise about it, that they will recommend a veto to the President if \nwe don't get this bill more in line with what the President's budget \nis. He is sending us a message.\n  I urge my colleagues to read that message, to listen to what the \nPresident is saying. He means business. He is right. We are spending \ntoo much money. This bill is an over 40 percent increase in highway \nspending. We all know roads and bridges need to be built. We all \nunderstand some jobs are produced. That is fine. But do we, in this era \nof budget deficits and excess spending, have to increase spending in \nthis one area by over 40 percent? Isn't a 21 percent increase over last \nyear sufficient?\n  The President's budget is almost flat. It has about a half a percent \nincrease--except for homeland security and defense--for the \ndiscretionary part of our budget. We know it is going to be difficult \nto live within that, but we should try. But how can we in good \nconscience pass a budget that has virtually no growth in it, except for \nhomeland security and defense, and then with regard to highways say \nthat is an exception; we are going to increase spending by 21 percent? \nThe income of how many people in this country will grow 21 percent this \nyear? Not very many. Not, certainly, for the average working man and \nwoman.\n\n  I daresay, at a 21 percent increase, we can do just as well, in terms \nof building our roads and highways, and then if we need to adjust it \nlater on because we are rolling in dough, we can do that. But for this \nyear at this time with this kind of deficit, we should not do it. That \nis what the President's advisors are saying in this letter.\n  What I would like to do is talk for a little bit about how the bill \nbefore us violates those three principles. Let me just cite a couple of \nexamples.\n  The first principle is that the transportation infrastructure \nspending should not rely on an increase in the gas tax or other Federal \ntaxes. It doesn't rely on an increase in the gas tax, but it will rely \nupon Federal taxes because we will be taking money from the general \nfund. That gets us to the\n\n[[Page S995]]\n\nsecond and third points. Transportation infrastructure should not be \nfunded through bonding--we are not going to do that--or other \nmechanisms that conceal the true cost to Federal taxpayers. I will show \nyou in this bill how that happened. And the third principle is highway \nspending should be financed from the highway trust fund and not from \nthe general fund of the Treasury.\n  No. 2 and No. 3 go together here. Let me give a couple of examples \nfrom the highway part of this; not mass transit but the highway part is \nfunded from the gas tax. We are going to collect $196 billion in gas \ntax revenue. That is how much we should spend on highways. But, no, we \nare going to be spending much more than that. How do we make up the \ndifference? Obviously, Members of Congress are pretty creative in \nfiguring out how to pay taxpayer dollars. So, a lot of new ways of \ndeeming money to be in the trust fund have been thought up here. Some \nof them actually I suggest have some merit.\n  Just to give one example: Interest in the highway trust fund. The \nhighway trust fund is a fund that has maybe $9 billion or $10 billion, \ngive or take $1 billion, in it at any given time. You have to have some \nmoney in the bank. It is like a bank account, to pay the checks when \nthey come due. There is always money coming in when people buy gasoline \nand pay the tax, and one thing we could do is attribute to the trust \nfund interest which is otherwise attributed to the general fund. That \nis between $1 and $2 billion. I am perfectly happy to have that \nattributed to the trust fund.\n  If you go through some exercises like that, you can get up to $214 \nbillion, more or less, in revenue you say is somewhat legitimately \nattributed to gas tax revenues.\n  Let me give you two examples of revenues that are being attributed to \nthe highway trust fund that really are not revenues in any sense of the \nterm, and, therefore, would violate both principle No. 2 and principle \nNo. 3.\n  One of these concepts has to do with the fact that counties, cities, \ntowns, churches, and schools are by and large exempt from paying a gas \ntax. What we are going to do in this bill is pretend like they actually \npaid the tax. That is worth, I think, $8 billion. That is a nice thing, \nif you can get away with it. But I don't think it reflects reality. \nThat is $8 billion. We are simply going to treat this as if the trust \nfund had received all of the money from counties, cities, towns, and so \non.\n  Is the general fund going to collect that money from the schools, \nchurches, cities, and towns? No. There isn't going to be any new \nrevenue. Your school district is not going to have to pay money for the \ngasoline that it buys for the schoolbuses that are driven. They will \nnot have to pay the Federal gasoline tax, but we will pretend like it \ndoes. That $8 billion is pretend money.\n  There is another part of this which they calculate at $9 billion that \nis attributed to the highway trust fund. What is this? The gas tax is \n18.3 cents. But for ethanol users, we provide that they don't have to \npay 5.2 cents of that. There is an exemption for that of 5.2 cents on \neach gallon. In this bill, we are going to pretend like they paid that \nto the trust fund. We are going to actually collect their money. The \nrevenue will actually be collected. But when people ask for a refund, \nwe will send it right back to them. Assuming that most people will ask \nfor a refund because they can get it, we are going to be sending the \nmoney right back to them.\n  As a result, we take with one hand and we give back with the other, \nand the fund is no better off. There is no real money in the fund \nexcept what was there before. We haven't added to the fund. We have \ncollected the 5.2 cents and then we give it back when the people apply \nfor the refund.\n  Since Federal contractors actually have to pay their people, buy \nasphalt, and run their road graders, how are we going to make up this \n$17 billion?\n  As I have indicated, in both cases this is not real money. We are \ngoing to get it from the general fund. We are going to just spend that \nmoney from the general fund.\n  How are we going to do that? It is not in the budget. The Finance \nCommittee has come up with a variety of tax law changes which will \nclose certain corporate loopholes and in other ways raise revenue that \nis not currently raised. We had hoped and anticipated that additional \nrevenue would be applied to a reform which has to do with corporate tax \nrelief that will have to be passed this year because the WTO--the World \nTrade Organization--has ruled against the United States in a case in \nwhich we have been providing some tax relief to American manufacturers \nabroad. We are going to have to take that tax relief away in order to \nmake these companies whole. We will have to pass a different kind of \ntax relief. To do that, you have to have the ability to pay for it. \nThat is what this money was going to be used for. Instead of using it \nfor that, we will use it to build bridges and highways. We will take \nthat money, put it in the general fund, and send that over to the \nhighway trust fund.\n  We are violating the principles laid down by the administration that \nnone of this bill should be paid for by either a mechanism that \nconceals the true cost to the taxpayers or financed from the general \nfund of the Treasury.\n\n  This bill, both by being in violation of at least some of the \nprinciples laid down by the President and by being $62 billion in \nexcess of what the President said the bill should cost, is going to \ncreate a situation in which the senior advisers of the President are \ngoing to recommend a veto. We should not be passing a bill under those \ncircumstances or be passing this bill under those circumstances.\n  What do we do about it? There are a couple of different options. One \nof the options is that we could simply modify the bill to take out that \n$62 billion, get it back down to the level of the President's budget, \nand support that. I have an amendment that would do that. In effect, it \nwill say the President's budget of $256 billion--that represents a 21-\npercent increase--ought to be enough, and, therefore, we would finance \nonly that amount of money.\n  I think we should vote on that and express our will in that regard, \nsupport the President, and be willing to begin exercising some fiscal \nrestraint.\n  Some people say they do not want to reduce the 6-year funding by that \nmuch money. They would actually be able to spend over 40 percent more \nthan last year and, therefore, maybe what we should do instead is \nsimply reauthorize the existing law for 1 year, get past the election, \nand then do another 6-year authorization bill that will spend 40 \npercent more than last year, since, obviously, that is going to cost \nmore money than we are taking in in gas tax revenues, since there are \nobjections to taking it from the general fund because that creates a \nhorrible precedent, and therefore we will raise the gas tax.\n  We don't want to tell people that because, of course, in an election \nyear we wouldn't want anybody to really think we intend to raise the \ngas tax. So let us be real quiet about this and not discuss this \nalternative too much because it assumes that next year we will come in \nand provide this large amount of money and raise the gas tax. We could \ndo that. It certainly is at least better than what we have before us, \nbecause it simply reauthorizes at existing levels the highway \nauthorization bill for 1 year and we can decide to do it next year at \nthe time. Some of us would oppose the gas tax increase.\n  I suggest that either of those alternatives are better than the third \nalternative, which is to pass the bill that is before us.\n  I want to make this clear. There are not very many people in this \nbody for whom I have greater respect than the chairman of the EPW \nCommittee, the Senator from Oklahoma. I don't mean to suggest in \nanything that I am saying here that the effort of the committee and the \nchairman of the committee is anything other than an attempt in good \nfaith to try to satisfy the demands of our country's infrastructure and \nprovide the best possible highway transit funding program they can. I \nwill say they have been very unfair about the way they treated my \nState, but that is another matter that I will talk about in a minute. I \nwant to make it clear that the chairman has a tough job. He has done \nhis very best in this regard. I want that to be very clear.\n  But the third alternative is to pass the bill before us. The argument \nmade is that we know it is way too much money but we will get into the \nconference committee because the House\n\n[[Page S996]]\n\nwill pass a bill and then you will have the House and the Senate bills. \nWe will get together and figure out an appropriate amount of money. We \nwill get the President's people in there to negotiate to make sure it \nwon't be too much so the President won't veto the bill.\n\n  That is another way to do it. I can't support that because we would \nbe supporting a bill out of this body that is far too big in spending.\n  The House bill presumably will be above the President's request. It \nis a little hard to figure out how we are going to start with a bill \nthat is $62 billion over what the President wants, and the House bill \nis--I don't know how much but let us pick a number--say, $50 billion \nmore than the President wants. And somehow they are going to compromise \nat a number closer to what the President wants. That is ordinarily not \nthe way things work around here. I think it will be close to $256 \nbillion. They are playing with fire and risk sending the bill to the \nPresident which he is going to veto. That will demonstrate that we are \nnot very responsible. I think that would be the wrong thing to do.\n  Let me address the other subject I said I would address, and that is \nthe fairness of this bill.\n  I say to my colleague from Oklahoma that he would be the very first \nto say it is almost impossible to get a bill that spends this amount of \nmoney and divvy it up among over 400 Members of the House of \nRepresentatives and 100 Senators and have everybody think they have \nbeen treated fairly, especially given the historic unfairness of the \nway the formulas have worked.\n  Again, he has a tough job. I make the point right up front that I \nknow he has tried his hardest to do this right. In fact, one of his \nguiding principles was to try to get all of the States up to a level of \nfunding equal to 95 cents out of every dollar that they send to \nWashington for the highway gas tax. The minimum level today is 90.5 \ncents.\n  There are a lot of us who represent donor States such as Arizona. We \nare donors. We send $1 and we only get 90.5 cents back in highway \nrevenues. The chairman wanted to try to do something about that to try \nto remove some of that unfairness. I commend him for that. For the most \npart, he has gotten States up to 95 cents out of every $1.\n  A lot of States are donee States, and they are way above a dollar. \nObviously, the reason only some States get 95 cents back is some States \nget more than $1. But I commend the chairman for trying to get at least \nto 95 cents.\n  The problem is, as has been explained to me, there are some fast-\ngrowth States, such as Florida, California, Colorado, or Arizona. We \nhave been at such a low level in the past in terms of the amount we \nwere reimbursed, the 90.5 cents, and we are growing so fast in order to \nkeep up with our growth, it would require so much money to catch us up \nto the 95-cent level that basically it cannot be done. So they will \nbring other States up to 95 percent, States that already for the past 5 \nyears have done very well, for the past 10 years have done very well. \nFor those States that have continually lagged behind, such as the \n``growth'' States I mentioned, since it is so darned expensive to catch \nthem up, we just will not try to do that for 5 years.\n\n  So here is the result we get, demonstrated on this chart. I note the \ndark blue represents on the chairman's chart a green color which he \ndemonstrated the other day when we were discussing this, saying: \nArizona actually will increase its spending over this period of time. \nThen in 2009--assuming the money is there--you will go back up to 95 \ncents like everyone else.\n  In 2004, the State of Arizona, which is in the dark blue, would get a \nlittle bit more--it gets 90.5 cents. That is what is guaranteed. In \n2005, we get 90.5 cents. In 2006, we get 90.5 cents, as well as in \n2007. In 2008 it goes up a little bit but is still under 91 cents. Then \nif there is enough money in 2009, hopefully we get to go back up to \nwhere everyone else is, guaranteed 95 cents.\n  We just took a State perhaps roughly comparable to Arizona, and this \nState happens to be Missouri, but I could pick any number of States \nthat illustrate the same idea. Missouri, on the other hand, is \nguaranteed 95 cents each one of these years.\n  Here is the point: During this 5-year period of time--because there \nwas not enough money, some State had to sacrifice or be sacrificed and \nthat happens to be my State of Arizona. I don't like that, and I don't \nthink it is fair. I would have rather had, in this case, Missouri \nbrought down to 93 and raise Arizona up to 93 rather than taking some \nall the way up to 95 and leaving the rest of us down at 90.\n  My colleague from Oklahoma says, but you are getting a substantial \npercentage increase and even a dollar increase, because you are growing \nso fast. That is true. But in terms of the total amount of money \nArizona would lose during this period of time, it is over $160 million. \nSo during this 5 years, Arizona will lose out on over $160 million it \nwould have received if it had been treated the same as the other States \nand gotten the base of 95 cents.\n  Remember, there are a lot of States that are way up here that are \ngetting over 100 cents, 110 cents; some are getting several dollars \nback. I will not name names.\n  The bottom line is some States are treated very well and States such \nas my State of Arizona are not treated so well. I obviously cannot be \nexpected to support a bill that picks on a few States such as mine and \nsays, look, we just did not have enough to go around so you have to be \nthe one that does not get paid what everyone else gets paid. We are \nsorry; be happy with the fact you are getting more money than you have \never gotten before.\n  My answer is, we are growing faster than anybody and therefore, of \ncourse, we are getting more money than we got in the past, but we are \nnot getting the same relative amount other States are. We are not \ngetting 95 cents on our dollar contributed. We are still stuck down \nhere at this 90.5 cent level. That is not fair.\n  I want to be clear about this. My opposition to this legislation is \nbased upon the first two points I made. It is too much money and we are \ngoing to fund it now out of general revenues rather than the highway \ntrust fund, as a result of which there will be no logical constraint on \nhow much we spend in the future. At least pegging it to what we \nreceived in Federal gas revenues in the past was a break-loss, a check \nand a balance, and it prevented us from going beyond that amount of \nmoney. But once you begin to dip into the general treasury, there is no \nlogical end to how far you can dip. As I said, you could double the \namount of increase the administration has asked for, you could go to \nover 40 percent increase and say, we are just going to make part of \nthat up through general revenues. Why not 50 or 60 percent? There is no \nlogical end once you get away from the highway trust fund. That is why \nI oppose this bill.\n  The sponsors of the bill were not able to equalize the States, as \nhard as they tried, in terms of the funding formula, and therefore \nthere are some Members from some States that obviously have to point \nthis out, have to demonstrate the unfairness and inequality of it and \nask the bill be amended to provide a more fair result.\n  The amendment I spoke of that funds the bill at $256 billion over 6 \nyears does not address this problem. So I make it clear, the amendment \nI have offered that allows people to vote for an amount in the highway \nspending that is consistent with the President's budget request does \nnot fix this. I am willing to support that amendment. I am willing to \nsend the bill to conference with that amount of money, but I am also \nhopeful my colleague from Texas will be offering an amendment \ntomorrow--has filed it and will offer tomorrow--that will to some \ndegree at least fix this problem for those states such as Texas and \nArizona which are not guaranteed the same 95 cents everyone else is \nguaranteed.\n  I am hopeful we will be able to vote on that and support that \ntomorrow.\n  There are other amendments which I will speak to later, one that my \ncolleague Senator McCain has offered that represents a good compromise \nin the way we fund highway revenue and reimburse the States. We will \ntalk about that tomorrow. There may be an additional amendment offered \ntomorrow we will want to support.\n  I am hoping I will have a chance to vote on these tomorrow. The way \nthis bill has procedurally come before the Senate, we will vote on a \ncloture petition tomorrow at 9 o'clock. That is a vote which presumably \nwill pass. It means we then have only 30 hours of\n\n[[Page S997]]\n\ndebate on the bill and opportunity to offer amendments and have those \namendments voted on. My understanding is there are over 400 amendments \nthat have been filed. On a bill of this importance and this magnitude, \nI don't think it is right we only have 30 hours to dispose of 400 \namendments. It obviously cannot be done.\n  I ask for my colleagues' understanding that when this debate begins \nafter the cloture motion is approved tomorrow--assuming it is--we will \nhave an opportunity to offer these amendments, have a brief period of \ntime to discuss them, have a vote on them, and go on to the next \namendment. It is not my intention to try to garble up the works or slow \nthings down. I hope we can speed things up to the point we can get \nthese amendments considered within that period of time. If not, because \nthere are actually two different cloture motions here, we may have to \nhave a second cloture vote and then have another 30 hours so we can \ncontinue to try to get the amendments adopted. That is something we are \njust going to have to work through. I ask for my colleagues' \ncooperation so that perhaps we can avoid that second 30 hours. But if \nnecessary, obviously, we will have to use that.\n  Now, if there are questions or refutation of anything I have said, I \nam happy to hear that and I can stay for a few minutes to try to answer \nor respond to questions.\n  If my colleague from Oklahoma would like to speak, I yield the floor \nto him.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Office of Management \n           and Budget,\n                                Washington, DC, February 11, 2004.\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n\n  s. 1072--safe, accountable, flexible, and efficient transportation \n                               equity act\n\n       The Administration supports enactment of a six-year \n     highway, highway safety, and transit authorization bill and \n     procedural efforts that would limit consideration of \n     extraneous amendments and bring the bill to an up or down \n     vote. Such a multi-year authorization would provide States \n     and localities with predictable funding that enhances long-\n     term transportation planning. The Administration's proposal, \n     as modified by the President's FY 2005 Budget, would provide \n     $256 billion over six years, an historically high level of \n     investment for highways and transit. This proposal represents \n     a $45 billion, or 21 percent, increase over the \n     Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21), the \n     six-year bill enacted in 1998.\n       The Administration believes that surface transportation \n     reauthorization legislation should exhibit spending restraint \n     and adhere to the following three principles: (1) \n     transportation infrastructure spending should not rely on an \n     increase in the gas tax or other Federal taxes; (2) \n     transportation infrastructure spending should not be funded \n     through bonding or other mechanisms that conceal the true \n     cost to Federal taxpayers; and (3) highway spending should be \n     financed from the Highway Trust Fund, not the General Fund of \n     the Treasury. All spending for highways should be authorized \n     and appropriated from the Trust Fund and derived from taxes \n     imposed on highway use, thereby maintaining the link between \n     Trust Fund revenues and highway spending.\n       However, the bill pending before the Senate authorizes: \n     $262 billion on highways and highway safety, which is $50 \n     billion above the President's request, and $56 billion on \n     mass transit, which is $12 billion above the President's \n     request. In total the Senate bill authorizes $318 billion in \n     spending on highways, highway safety, and mass transit over \n     the next six years, a full $62 billion above the President's \n     request for the same period.\n       The Administration's proposed authorization level of $256 \n     billion over six years is consistent with the three \n     principles listed above. We support a responsible six-year \n     bill and support many of the provisions contained in this \n     legislation. However, we oppose S. 1072 and the pending \n     substitute because their spending levels are too high and \n     they violate these principles discussed above. Accordingly, \n     if legislation that violates these principles (such as this \n     legislation, which authorizes $318 billion) were presented to \n     the President, his senior advisors would recommend that he \n     veto the bill.\n       In addition, the Administration opposes inclusion in a \n     surface transportation bill of unrelated provisions regarding \n     Amtrak. Any legislation regarding the future of Amtrak should \n     be considered separately and should provide for meaningful \n     reforms, such as those proposed by the Administration. If \n     surface transportation legislation containing such provisions \n     were presented to the President, his senior advisors would \n     recommend that he veto the bill. The Administration wants to \n     work closely with Congress to achieve an acceptable bill \n     and recommends attention to the following areas.\n       Safety. The Administration appreciates the creation of a \n     new Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP) and a strong \n     safety belt incentive program, but believes the bill should \n     also require States that have not enacted primary safety belt \n     laws or achieved safety belt use rates of 90 percent to spend \n     no less than 10 percent of core highway safety construction \n     HSIP funds on behavioral safety projects eligible under the \n     Section 402 program. In addition, the Administration opposes \n     limiting a State's flexibility to use HSIP funds by requiring \n     mandatory set-asides for rail-highway grade crossings or safe \n     routes to schools. The Administration believes that several \n     programs of the National Highway Traffic Safety \n     Administration (NHTSA) should be consolidated and a portion \n     of those funds should be used to reward States that \n     aggressively reduce fatalities in the manner proposed by \n     Section 2001(a) of the Administration's proposal. Also, \n     language similar to that included in the Administration's \n     proposal on providing for NHTSA-administered highway safety \n     data grants should be added to help States improve their data \n     to reasonable standards.\n       Environmental Provisions. The Administration opposes \n     substantially broadening the list of eligible projects for \n     Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ) funding because \n     many of these new projects would have minimal air quality \n     benefits. Eligibility for CMAQ funds should be limited to \n     projects that achieve air quality benefits, particularly \n     because the number of Clean Air Act nonattainment areas, \n     which need this type of funding, will increase. The \n     Administration believes that the bill should improve project \n     delivery while protecting our environment. The bill should \n     include a 180-day statute of limitations for legal challenges \n     following final agency approval of highway and transit \n     projects. This limit is necessary to reduce litigation \n     uncertainty that can impede project development for years. \n     The bill should also avoid adding new requirements to the \n     transportation planning process, and integrate the \n     transportation planning process with other environmental \n     review processes to reduce redundancies.\n       With respect to project review under the National \n     Environmental Policy Act, the bill should clarify the \n     authority of State and local governments to be joint lead \n     agencies, with the U.S. Department of Transportation, in \n     preparing environmental documents. The Administration also \n     notes that section 1511 is inconsistent with the President's \n     proposal is SAFETEA, and encourages the Senate to adopt the \n     President's proposal.\n       The Administration also believes that the bill should \n     clarify standards pertaining to public park and recreational \n     lands, wildlife and waterfowl refuges, and historic sites--\n     commonly referred to as ``Section 4(g).'' A clarification of \n     the Section 4(f) definition of ``prudent'' is needed to \n     forestall confusing standards applied unevenly by the Federal \n     Courts of Appeals. In addition, the bill should address the \n     overlap between Section 4(f) and Section 106 of the National \n     Historic Preservation Act to decrease project delays and \n     uncertainty.\n       In addition, the Administration believes that the bill \n     should not include a mandatory two percent set-aside from the \n     Surface Transportation Program (STP) to support a highway \n     stormwater discharge mitigation program. Stormwater discharge \n     mitigation costs are already eligible under STP.\n       New Regulatory Mandates. The Administration strongly \n     opposes the numerous mandated rulemakings for NHTSA and the \n     FMCSA. These provisions predetermine timetables and \n     outcomes without adequate grounding in science, \n     engineering and proof of net safety benefits. By \n     prescribing specific requirements and mandating \n     priorities, these provisions will delay or interfere with \n     ongoing safety initiatives and may have the unintended \n     consequence of redirecting agency resources away from \n     programs that will do more overall good for safety. The \n     Administration also objects to the inclusion of: (1) \n     costly and burdensome provisions of the bill requiring \n     FMCSA to issue medical certificates to 6.5 million \n     commercial drivers while limiting the performance of \n     medical examinations to physicians alone; and (2) the \n     bill's expansion of hours-of-service safety exemptions.\n       Financing and Freight Mobility. The Administration \n     appreciates the bill's expansion of the Transportation \n     Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) loan \n     program by lowering the project threshold and broadening the \n     list of eligible projects to include freight projects. \n     However, the Administration opposes removing the TIFIA \n     program requirement that a borrower have a dedicated source \n     of revenue for repaying its TIFIA loan. Likewise, the \n     Administration opposes allowing railroads to use Federal \n     grants to pay the credit risk premium or repay Railroad \n     Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing loans.\n       The Administration supports amending the bill to give \n     States the ability to manage congestion and raise additional \n     revenue by allowing drivers of single occupant vehicles to \n     use High Occupancy Vehicle lanes by paying tolls. The \n     Administration also supports amending the bill to provide \n     States flexibility to implement variable tolls on interstates \n     for congestion management or air quality improvement \n     purposes. In addition, the Administration supports amending \n     the bill to incorporate the Administration's proposal to \n     amend the Internal Revenue Code to permit the issuance by \n     State and local governments of ``private activity bonds'' for \n     highways and surface freight transfer facilities.\n       Public Transportation Programs. Aside from concerns about \n     overall funding levels,\n\n[[Page S998]]\n\n     the Administration is pleased that the bill includes \n     provisions to improve human service transportation \n     coordination and expand the ``New Starts'' program, but is \n     disappointed by the omission of a performance incentive \n     program to reward transit agencies based on increases in \n     transit ridership.\n       Accountability and Oversight. The Administration is pleased \n     that the bill includes stringent project management and \n     financial plan requirements which were requested by the \n     Administration. Improved accountability and focused oversight \n     by the Federal Highway Administration will help maximize the \n     effective use of available funds.\n       Funding Firewalls and Guarantees. The Administration \n     supports a separate category or ``firewalls'' for determining \n     the level of spending from the Highway Trust Fund, but only \n     in the context of the Administration's proposal for annual \n     statutory limits on discretionary spending. In addition, the \n     Administration does not propose the creation of ``firewalls'' \n     for general fund spending on such critical areas as defense \n     and homeland security, and therefore opposes such treatment \n     for general fund spending on mass transit programs.\n       Byrd Test Change. The Administration opposes weakening the \n     Byrd Test to compare spending authority to current resources \n     plus for years, rater than two years, of estimated future \n     revenue. The Byrd Test was established at the creation of the \n     Highway Trust Fund in 1956 to ensure that future revenues \n     would be sufficient to cover outstanding spending \n     authority. The Byrd Test has been successful in ensuring \n     the Highway Trust Fund's solvency for nearly 50 years, and \n     modification could allow levels of spending that cannot be \n     sustained by estimated revenues to the Highway Trust Fund.\n       Park Roads. The Administration supports the funding level \n     for park roads, but opposes the provisions of section 1806 of \n     the bill that establish a park funding priority system that \n     would reduce the Administration's ability to implement the \n     President's Park Legacy Program. Allocation of park road \n     funding should be consistent with the sound asset management \n     approach on which the President's Park Legacy Program is \n     based and which is currently used by the National Park \n     Service, in a manner that will best address the needs of all \n     parks, not just a few.\n       Cross-Border Transportation. The Administration opposes the \n     bill's provisions defining foreign trucks and buses engaged \n     in the cross-border transportation of cargo and passengers \n     into the United States as ``imports.'' Existing statutory \n     provisions already address cross-border transportation \n     safety, and the revised definition would significantly \n     disrupt the almost $2 billion daily cross-border movement of \n     goods.\n       MAGLEV. The Administration opposes the continued \n     authorization of funding for Magnetic Levitation \n     Transportation Technology Deployment (MAGLEV). The \n     Administration's SAFETEA proposal did not seek funding for \n     MAGLEV and believes funds can be better spent investing in \n     the Nation's public transportation systems.\n\n                    Budget estimates and enforcement\n\n       This bill would affect direct spending and receipts. It is \n     critical to exercise responsible restraint over Federal \n     spending in a manner that ensures deficit reduction and the \n     Administration looks forward to working with Congress to \n     control the cost of this bill. The Budget Enforcement Act's \n     pay-as-you-go requirements and discretionary spending caps \n     expired on September 30, 2002. The President's FY 2005 Budget \n     includes a proposal to extend the discretionary caps through \n     2009, a pay-as-you-go requirement that would be limited to \n     direct spending, and a new mechanism to control the expansion \n     of long-term unfunded obligations. OMB's cost estimate of \n     this bill currently is under development.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. First of all, there is no one I have a higher regard for \nthan the man who was elected with me to the other body in 1986, Senator \nKyl, the junior Senator from Arizona, and they elected him then to come \nover to this body in 1984. We are both conservatives.\n  He has heard me say many times when I was first elected to the other \nbody, I got on the Transportation Committee and the reason I did it was \nbecause I always felt the conservatives were pretty big spenders in two \nareas. One is national defense and the other is infrastructure. That is \nwhat we are sent here for. Apparently, the most recent poll I saw shows \nthe vast majority of the people, 69 percent, are willing to spend more \nmoney if it will be spent on highways, roads, and bridges. I see that \nas what we are here for.\n  I have to address the fact that there are a lot of amendments that \nhave come up. I have stood here for 2 weeks trying to get people to \npropose amendments, to discuss their amendments. We sit down here and \nwe talk about everything there is to talk about until now at last there \nis hysteria that we do not have time to bring up our amendments. There \nhas been plenty of time.\n  I have to say, too, to my good friend, the junior Senator from \nArizona, it is because of the senior Senator from Arizona that we have \nnot been able to bring up the amendments because they are objecting to \nany motions to bring them down to vote. That means the only thing we \ncan vote on that does not require that particular permission is a \ntabling motion which we have done only once because no one else has had \nanything else to table.\n  So that is the reason.\n  I regret that we wasted a lot of time when we were inviting people to \ncome down. Those who were opposed to this for any number of reasons--\nsome legitimate reasons, some not so legitimate--were the ones who were \nstopping us from moving forward with the bill.\n  First, I think as far as the cloture motion, the Senator from Arizona \nis exactly right. In fact, I appreciate the letter he was citing from \nthe administration that came down today. It says: ``The Administration \nsupports enactment of a six-year highway [bill],'' and so forth, and \nthey are in support of the cloture motion.\n  So this is the administration that is in support of the cloture \nmotion. I think if you look at the letter--and I will give you a \ndifferent slant than my friend from Arizona--they have three criteria. \nThere is nothing new about this. I saw this 2 months ago. I saw it on \nthe 4th of this month when they sent a letter from the administration. \nIt says these three criteria are:\n\n       [T]ransportation infrastructure spending should not rely on \n     an increase in the gas tax or other Federal taxes. . . .\n\n  I believe this meets that guideline.\n\n       (2) transportation infrastructure spending should not be \n     funded through bonding or other mechanisms that conceal the \n     true cost to Federal taxpayers. . . .\n\n  I agree with that. In fact, I have been the one who has rejected the \nsuggestion of any type of a bonding that might just be deficit spending \nin disguise, something we are going to pay back in the future, some \nincreased debt.\n  This is the big one. This is the one the Senator, with his vast \nknowledge, has gone through and who is in a better position to do that \nthan I; and that is the criterion that says:\n\n       [H]ighway spending should be financed from the Highway \n     Trust Fund, not the General Fund of the Treasury.\n\n  Now, perhaps it is hard. There could be an honest disagreement here. \nIf some money is going to the general fund and is being paid at the \npumps by people who are paying for the gas tax, that should be going \ninto the highway trust fund. It is user paid. We all agree with that \nconcept.\n  For those of us who feel strongly about this, I can remember I was \noutraged back in the middle 1990s when the previous administration came \nthrough and they wanted $8 billion so they could do something other \nthan roads, and it came out of the trust fund and went into the general \nfund. Frankly, this takes it back. This rectifies a problem that should \nnot have existed in the first place and keeps us honest with the \nAmerican people.\n  Look at the moral issue part of this. The people drive up to the \npump. There is not a Senator who does not have constituents who drive \nup to the pump. They don't mind paying that tax--some say they would go \nahead and pay more taxes--and they assume that money is going to go for \nthe repair and construction of roads and infrastructure. In fact, that \nis not the case. There have been raids on that for a long period of \ntime.\n  I am not going to go over the list of the Finance Committee. I talked \nto the chairman and the ranking member of the Finance Committee back \nwhen we were working on this bill well over a year ago. It said when we \ncome up with what we believe is necessary to just stay even--there is \none report out that says even with this spending level that does not \neven keep us repairing what we have today, but if this comes up, you \nguys in the Finance Committee are going to be the ones who have to come \nup with this.\n\n  I have never been on the Finance Committee. I have never attended one \nof their meetings. I don't know how it works. But I do know the \nchairman and ranking member said: We have come up with a way to come up \nwith this money. Sure, a lot of it, as the Senator mentioned, is \nspending down the trust fund. Yes, we can do that probably to $6.5 \nbillion without hurting ourselves. That is an assumption we make here. \nThe interest? Yes, it should go to the\n\n[[Page S999]]\n\ntrust fund. There are some fixes in there in terms of ethanol that are \nall part of it. This going after people who avoided paying taxes is \nsomething we would all agree is something that should happen.\n  The one area the Senator mentions, frankly, I can't address is having \nto do with the WTO. I am just going to trust the Finance Committee that \nthey have come up with this and have done what I asked them to do a \nlong period of time ago.\n  Oh, yes, in response to that, I was underlining something. This came \nout in the Finance Committee, I say to my friend from Arizona. It said: \nIn the view of the Finance Committee, these tax policy benefits--we are \ntalking about benefits deductions, whether they are ethanol or maybe a \ncar that is fuel efficient--nonetheless, to encourage them to do that, \nthey are exempt from certain taxes. But those cars and those trucks \nstill drive on our roads, still cause damage to the roads, and because \nthey want to have a tax policy that has nothing to do with \ninfrastructure, has nothing to do with roads and highways, fine, if we \nall agree on that, it should come out of the general fund, it should \nnot come out of the highway trust fund. We are rectifying that and \ngetting it back to the highway trust fund.\n  Now, on formulas, this is the most complicated part of the bill. I \nsay to the Senator, your senior Senator came down and said he would \nlike to trade formulas with Oklahoma. I have to say, as I have said \nseveral times down here in the last 2 weeks, everyone has the same \nformula. You have the same formula. North Carolina has the same \nformula. Maine has the same formula; Oklahoma does.\n  Now, the results come out differently because in that formula we are \ntaking care of problems that are real problems. Arizona is a fast-\ngrowing State, the State of Texas, the State of California, the State \nof Florida. So in order to make all of this happen, there are caps, \nthere are ceilings. If you bump the ceiling, we are not going to go \nabove that. You may not like it because you are a fast-growing State. \nBut if you don't, then that is going to be paid for in the formula with \na change, maybe a change that is going to be coming in the form of an \namendment tomorrow, by getting into some of the States such as \nPennsylvania and New York.\n  So here is what we have in the formula: No. 1, total lane miles on \nthe interstate, on principal arterial routes; No. 2, VMT--that is, \nvehicle miles traveled--on the Interstate System, on principal arterial \nroutes, excluding the interstate, and on the Federal aid system; No. 3, \nannual contributions to the highway trust fund attributed to commercial \nvehicles; No. 4, diesel fuel used on highways; No. 5, relative share of \ntotal cost to repair or replace deficient highway bridges--I am very \nsensitive to that; my State of Oklahoma is dead last in terms of the \ncondition of bridges--next, weighted nonattainment and maintenance \nareas and, lastly, rate of return of donor States.\n\n  We all know that the Senator from Arizona and I both know all about \nbeing a donor State. If we accelerated the point within those 6 years \nto raise that amount, then, obviously, there would not be enough money \nto ultimately get to the 95 percent we want to ultimately get to. So if \nyou change one thing in the formula, it changes everything. You cannot \ndo it in a vacuum.\n  There will be amendments, I am sure, tomorrow that are going to be \naddressing this and wanting to change the formula. But if you do it, it \nis going to change other States.\n  Now, if you will remember, the reason I am proud of this formula is \nthat we have tried to do it. We tried to do it in 1991 with ISTEA. We \ntried to do it in TEA-21 in 1998. We failed during that time because \nright about at this point in the process they said: Well, we can't do \nit. There are too many people who don't like the way the formula has \ncome out. So instead of that, we need 60 votes. How do we get 60 votes?\n  So they had a minimum guarantee. They said: All right. We are going \nto offer 60 of these votes what they want in terms of a percentage of \nthe overall, and then, once we get to 60 votes, who cares? We have our \n60 votes and we are going to pass it.\n  Well, I refused to do that back when the temptation was great to do \nit about 3 months ago. So the formula is going to be the first pure \nformula that we have had. But are there frailties in it? Yes, there \nare. There are corrections to be made because if you look in previous \nyears at States where they have had an undue political influence, they \nhave gotten more than their share.\n  Let's look at Pennsylvania. They had a good friend of the Senator \nfrom Arizona and myself who served in the other body, Bud Shuster, a \nCongressman from Pennsylvania. He, for a number of years, was the \nchairman of the committee, and Pennsylvania did disproportionately \nwell.\n  I would say the same thing of our beloved Daniel Patrick Moynihan of \nthe State of New York; certainly John Chafee, one we all loved, from \nRhode Island. So the Northeast got kind of a benefit to which they were \nnot entitled.\n  In fact, to be specific, under TEA-21--let's keep in mind I was a \nsenior member of the Environment and Public Works Committee in 1998 \nwhen we put this together. And so at that time, in terms of a \npercentage of taxes paid in, New York got $1.25 back; Pennsylvania, \n$1.20 back; Rhode Island, $2.16 back; Montana--Senator Baucus, who is a \nvery hard worker for his State--$2.18 back; Oklahoma, 90.5 cents, the \nminimum, the bare minimum.\n  I am the guy who should be out here complaining. When your senior \nSenator said, we ought to swap, if we swapped, I would end up with $40 \nmillion more. I will stand here right now and swap with you, and it \nwill not affect any of the rest of the formula.\n  The formulas are not an easy thing to deal with.\n  Insofar as the State of Arizona is concerned, if you take an average \nof the 6 years of TEA-21, $463 million, and then you watch as it goes \nup here to finally reach $800 million, the total amount of increase is \n$1.11 billion in the State of Arizona. For my State of Oklahoma, the \nchart looks almost the same, but the difference is we end up at $1.07 \nbillion. So there is $40 million more going to the State of Arizona. I \ndon't like that. If I were to try to do something as chairman, I \nprobably could have. I could probably have looked at the first run and \nsaid, no, Oklahoma needs to have more. But I didn't do it because we \nwanted the formulas to work. So the formulas are something that you \ncan't mess with because if you do, you get right back to the minimum \nguarantee policy we have had in the past. I don't think that is good \nfor anyone.\n  Since we have committed some time to two other Members, including the \nSenator from North Carolina, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the \nRecord the Statement of Administration Policy dated February 11, 2004, \nand also, though I did not quote from it, an editorial of the Wall \nStreet Journal entitled ``Road Kill,'' and the date is February 10, \n2004.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Office of Management \n           and Budget, Washington, DC, February 11, 2004.\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n\n  s. 1072--safe, accountable, flexible, and efficient transportation \n                               equity act\n\n             (Senator Inhofe (R) Oklahoma and 3 cosponsors)\n\n       The Administration supports enactment of a six-year \n     highway, highway safety, and transit authorization bill and \n     procedural efforts that would limit consideration of \n     extraneous amendments and bring the bill to an up or down \n     vote. Such a multi-year authorization would provide States \n     and localities with predictable funding that enhances long-\n     term transportation planning. The Administration's proposal, \n     as modified by the President's FY 2005 Budget, would provide \n     $256 billion over six years, an historically high level of \n     investment for highways and transit. This proposal represents \n     a $45 billion, or 21 percent, increase over the \n     Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21), the \n     six-year bill enacted in 1998.\n       The Administration believes that surface transportation \n     reauthorization legislation should exhibit spending restraint \n     and adhere to the following three principles: (1) \n     transportation infrastructure spending should not rely on an \n     increase in the gas tax or other Federal taxes; (2) \n     transportation infrastructure spending should not be funded \n     through\n\n[[Page S1000]]\n\n     bonding or other mechanisms that conceal the true cost to \n     Federal taxpayers; and (3) highway spending should be \n     financed from the Highway Trust Fund, not the General Fund of \n     the Treasury. All spending for highways should be authorized \n     and appropriated from the Trust Fund and derived from taxes \n     imposed on highway use, thereby maintaining the link between \n     Trust Fund revenues and highway spending.\n       However, the bill pending before the Senate authorizes: \n     $262 billion on highways and highway safety, which is $50 \n     billion above the President's request, and $56 billion on \n     mass transit, which is $12 billion above the President's \n     request. In total the Senate bill authorizes $318 billion in \n     spending on highways, highway safety, and mass transit over \n     the next six years, a full $62 billion above the President's \n     request for the same period.\n       The Administration proposed authorization of $256 billion \n     over six years is consistent with the three principles listed \n     above. We support a responsible six-year bill and support \n     many of the provisions contained in this legislation. \n     However, we oppose S. 1072 and the pending substitute because \n     their spending levels are too high and they violate these \n     principles discussed above. Accordingly, if legislation that \n     violates these principles (such as this legislation, which \n     authorizes $318 billion) were presented to the President, his \n     senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.\n       In addition, the Administration opposes inclusion in a \n     surface transportation bill of unrelated provisions regarding \n     Amtrak. Any legislation regarding the future of Amtrak should \n     be considered separately and should provide for meaningful \n     reforms, such as those proposed by the Administration. If \n     surface transportation legislation containing such provisions \n     were presented to the President, his senior advisors would \n     recommend that he veto the bill.\n       The Administration wants to work closely with Congress to \n     achieve an acceptable bill and recommends attention to the \n     following areas.\n       Safety. The Administration appreciates the creation of a \n     new Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP) and a strong \n     safety belt incentive program, but believes the bill should \n     also require States that have not enacted primary safety belt \n     laws or achieved safety belt use rates of 90 percent to spend \n     no less than 10 percent of core highway safety construction \n     HSIP funds on behavioral safety projects eligible under the \n     Section 402 program. In addition, the Administration opposes \n     limiting a State's flexibility to use HSIP funds by requiring \n     mandatory set-asides for rail-highway grade crossings or safe \n     routes to schools. The Administration believes that several \n     programs of the National Highway Traffic Safety \n     Administration (NHTSA) should be consolidated and a portion \n     of those funds should be used to reward States that \n     aggressively reduce fatalities in the manner proposed by \n     Section 2001(a) of the Administration's proposal. Also, \n     language similar to that included in the Administration's \n     proposal on providing for NHTSA-administered highway safety \n     data grants should be added to help States improve their data \n     to reasonable standards.\n       Environmental Provisions. The Administration opposes \n     substantially broadening the list of eligible projects for \n     Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ) funding because \n     many of these new projects would have minimal air quality \n     benefits. Eligibility for CMAQ funds should be limited to \n     projects that achieve air quality benefits, particularly \n     because the number of Clean Air Act nonattainment areas, \n     which need this type of funding, will increase. The \n     Administration believes that the bill should improve project \n     delivery while protecting our environment. The bill should \n     include a 180-day statute of limitations for legal challenges \n     following final agency approval of highway and transit \n     projects. This limit is necessary to reduce litigation \n     uncertainty that can impede project development for years. \n     The bill should also avoid adding new requirements to the \n     transportation planning process, and integrate the \n     transportation planning process with other environmental \n     review processes to reduce redundancies.\n       With respect to project review under the National \n     Environmental Policy Act, the bill should clarify the \n     authority of State and local governments to be joint lead \n     agencies, with the U.S. Department of Transportation, in \n     preparing environmental documents. The Administration also \n     notes that section 1511 is inconsistent with the President's \n     proposal in SAFETEA, and encourages the Senate to adopt the \n     President's proposal.\n       The Administration also believes that the bill should \n     clarify standards pertaining to public park and recreation \n     lands, wildlife and waterfowl refuges, and historic sites--\n     commonly referred to as ``Section 4(f).'' A clarification of \n     the Section 4(f) definition of ``prudent'' is needed to \n     forestall confusing standards applied unevenly by the Federal \n     Courts of Appeals. In addition, the bill should address the \n     overlap between Section 4(f) and Section 106 of the National \n     Historic Preservation Act to decrease project delays and \n     uncertainty.\n       In addition, the Administration believes that the bill \n     should not include a mandatory two percent set-aside from the \n     Surface Transportation Program (STP) to support a highway \n     stormwater discharge mitigation program. Stormwater discharge \n     mitigation costs are already eligible under STP.\n       New Regulatory Mandates. The Administration strongly \n     opposes the numerous mandated rulemakings for NHTSA and the \n     FMCSA. These provisions predetermine timetables and \n     outcomes without adequate grounding in science, \n     engineering and proof of net safety benefits. By \n     prescribing specific requirements and mandating \n     priorities, these provisions will delay or interfere with \n     ongoing safety initiatives and may have the unintended \n     consequence of redirecting agency resources away from \n     programs that will do more overall good for safety. The \n     Administration also objects to the inclusion of: (1) \n     costly and burdensome provisions of the bill requiring \n     FMCSA to issue medical certificates to 6.5 million \n     commercial drivers while limiting the performance of \n     medical examinations to physicians alone; and (2) the \n     bill's expansion of hours-of-service safety exemptions.\n       Financing and Freight Mobility. The Administration \n     appreciates the bill's expansion of the Transportation \n     Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) loan \n     program by lowering the project threshold and broadening the \n     list of eligible projects to include freight projects. \n     However, the Administration opposes removing the TIFIA \n     program requirement that a borrower have a dedicated source \n     of revenue for repaying its TIFIA loan. Likewise, the \n     Administration opposes allowing railroads to use Federal \n     grants to pay the credit risk premium or repay Railroad \n     Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing loans.\n       The Administration supports amending the bill to give \n     States the ability to manage congestion and raise additional \n     revenue by allowing drivers of single occupant vehicles to \n     use High Occupancy Vehicle lanes by paying tolls. The \n     Administration also supports amending the bill to provide \n     States flexibility to implement variable tolls on interstates \n     for congestion management or air quality improvement \n     purposes. In addition, the Administration supports amending \n     the bill to incorporate the Administration's proposal to \n     amend the Internal Revenue Code to permit the issuance by \n     State and local governments of ``private activity bonds'' for \n     highways and surface freight transfer facilities.\n       Public Transportation Programs. Aside from concerns about \n     overall funding levels, the Administration is pleased that \n     the bill includes provisions to improve human service \n     transportation coordination and expand the ``New Starts'' \n     program, but is disappointed by the omission of a performance \n     incentive program to reward transit agencies based on \n     increases in transit ridership.\n       Accountability and Oversight. The Administration is pleased \n     that the bill includes stringent project management and \n     financial plan requirements which were requested by the \n     Administration. Improved accountability and focused oversight \n     by the Federal Highway Administration will help maximize the \n     effective use of available funds.\n       Funding Firewalls and Guarantees. The Administration \n     supports a separate category or ``firewalls'' for determining \n     the level of spending from the Highway Trust fund, but only \n     in the context of the Administration's proposal for annual \n     statutory limits on discretionary spending. In addition, the \n     Administration does not propose the creating of ``firewalls'' \n     for general fund spending on such critical areas as defense \n     and homeland security, and therefore opposes such treatment \n     for general fund spending on mass transit programs.\n       Byrd Test Change. The Administration opposes weakening the \n     Byrd Test to compare spending authority to current resources \n     plus four years, rather than two years, of estimated future \n     revenue. The Byrd Test was established at the creation of the \n     Highway Trust Fund in 1956 to ensure that future revenues \n     would be sufficient to cover outstanding spending authority. \n     The Byrd Test has been successful in ensuring the Highway \n     Trust Fund's solvency for nearly 50 years, and modification \n     could allow levels of spending that cannot be sustained by \n     estimated revenues to the Highway Trust fund.\n       Park Roads. The Administration supports the funding level \n     for park roads, but opposes the provisions of section 1806 of \n     the bill that establish a park funding priority system that \n     would reduce the Administration's ability to implement the \n     President's Park Legacy Program. Allocation of park road \n     funding should be consistent with the sound asset management \n     approach on which the President's Park Legacy Program is \n     based and which is currently used by the National Park \n     Service, in a manner that will best address the needs of all \n     parks, not just a few.\n       Cross-Border Transportation. The Administration opposes the \n     bill's provisions defining foreign trucks and buses engaged \n     in the cross-border transportation of cargo and passengers \n     into the United States as ``imports.'' Existing statutory \n     provisions already address cross-border transportation \n     safety, and the revised definition would significantly \n     disrupt the almost $2 billion daily cross-border movement of \n     goods.\n       MAGLEV. The Administration opposes the continued \n     authorization of funding for Magnetic Levitation \n     Transportation Technology Deployment (MAGLEV). The \n     Administration's SAFETEA proposal did not seek funding for \n     MAGLEV and believes funds can be better spent investing in \n     the Nation's public transportation systems.\n       Budget Estimates and Enforcement. This bill would affect \n     direct spending and receipts. It is critical to exercise \n     responsible restraint over Federal spending in a manner that \n     ensures deficit reduction and the Administration looks \n     forward to working with\n\n[[Page S1001]]\n\n     congress to control the cost of this bill. The Budget \n     Enforcement Act's pay-as-you-go requirements and \n     discretionary spending caps expired on September 30, 2002. \n     The President's FY 2005 Budget includes a proposal to extend \n     the discretionary caps through 2009, a pay-as-you-go \n     requirement that would be limited to direct spending, and a \n     new mechanism to control the expansion of long-term unfunded \n     obligations. OMB's cost estimate of this bill currently is \n     under development.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Feb. 10, 2004]\n\n     Road Kill--Congress's Spending Binge Moves to the Passing Lane\n\n       An old political adage has it that the most dangerous place \n     in Washington is between a Congressman and asphalt. That is \n     exactly where taxpayers now find themselves as Congress \n     conspires to pass another monster highway bill. The only good \n     news is that President Bush is showing signs he may fight \n     this election-year porkfest.\n       The Administration has its own highway proposal, which is \n     hardly cheap. Mr. Bush is asking for $256 billion over six \n     years, which is 21% more than the past six years and fairly \n     close to Treasury estimates of revenue from the current 18.4-\n     cent-a-gallon federal gas tax that is earmarked for roads.\n       Ah, but this isn't enough for the boys of summer \n     construction. The draft Senate bill demands $55 billion more \n     than Mr. Bush and is loaded with fiscal gimmicks that divert \n     money from general (non-gas-tax) revenues into road building. \n     The House bill from Transportation Chairman Don Young is even \n     worse--an astonishing $375 billion with a five-cent gas-tax \n     increase.\n       Notwithstanding lip service to the budget deficit, the \n     strategy for passing this is to offer so many goodies for \n     individual Members that they can't resist. The American Road \n     & Transportation Builders Association, aka the road graders \n     lobby, recently advertised how much more booty each Member \n     could take home under the Young bill.\n       In the Senate, meanwhile, Minority Leader Tom Daschle is \n     planning to attach his stalled ethanol-subsidy legislation \n     (cost to drivers: $8.5 billion a year) to the bill in order \n     to attract farm state votes--and grease his own re-election \n     this year. Republicans who go along with this self-serving \n     gambit will be helping Mr. Daschle defeat GOP challenger John \n     Thune in South Dakota this fall.\n       One of the more embarrassing arguments from Congress's \n     highwaymen is that this is somehow a ``jobs bill.'' So at \n     least for this parochial matter, Republicans claim to believe \n     in the superiority of government over private spending. Some \n     Econ 101: Highway spending rolls out slowly over many years \n     but new taxes are immediately taken away from the more \n     productive private economy. It's more accurate to say that \n     Mr. Young's bill would be a net job loser.\n       If Republicans really wanted to be true to their \n     principles, they'd scale back the federal highway fund and \n     return road-financing to the states. The federal government \n     got into this game in the 1950s to build the Interstate \n     Highway System. That network is nearly complete, but Congress \n     now views the highway trust fund as a way to make all \n     Americans pay for local road projects. States are much better \n     placed to judge real needs, and they'd have the flexibility \n     to experiment with innovative proposals like tolls, express \n     lanes and public-private partnerships.\n       Such delusional hope aside, the ultimate size of this bill \n     will depend on Mr. Bush's determination to enforce his budget \n     request. History isn't necessarily on his side; when Ronald \n     Reagan vetoed a highway bill in 1987, Congress overrode him. \n     And despite calls last week from fiscal conservatives to \n     delay the bill, Majority Leader Bill Frist refused after 75 \n     Senators voted to start debate.\n       Still, this is a fight worth having. Congress will keep \n     spending freely until Mr. Bush shows he's willing to spend \n     political capital to say no. In a letter to Congress last \n     week, Administration officials warned that any bill that \n     includes higher gas taxes, trickster accounting or a \n     siphoning of general tax revenues will face a veto. \n     Presidents who make veto threats and don't fulfill them \n     quickly become irrelevant.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the \nRecord the summary of the Finance Committee's highway trust fund \nproposal.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        Summary of Finance Committee Highway Trust Fund Proposal\n\n       Finance Committee jurisdiction extends to the highway use-\n     related excise taxes, the Highway Trust Fund, and the \n     expenditure authority of the Highway Trust Fund. The Finance \n     Committee acted primarily on the cash flow into and out of \n     the trust fund. Cash flow into the trust fund is represented \n     by trust fund excise tax receipts. Cash flow out of the trust \n     fund is represented by trust fund outlays. Matters involving \n     contract authority and obligation limits are not Finance \n     Committee subject matter and the committee did not speak to \n     them.\n       According to the Congressional Budget Office (``CBO''), \n     current law trust fund receipts will total $227.8 billion \n     over the six year period. CBO projects $196 billion in \n     highway account receipts and $31.8 billion in mass transit \n     account receipts.\n       The authorizing committees' actions placed demands on the \n     trust fund of $231 billion for highways and $36.6 billion for \n     transit for the six year authorization period. That means a \n     total of $267.6 billion in demands on the trust fund.\n       Prior to Finance Committee action, demands on the trust \n     fund exceeded receipts by $39.8 billion over the six year \n     period. To make up this funding gap, the Finance Committee \n     developed two categories of proposals. The first category \n     increased trust fund receipts by tightening compliance. The \n     second category included accounting changes that raised trust \n     fund receipts.\n       The compliance changes raised trust fund receipts by $5.6 \n     billion over the authorization period. These changes were \n     also scored as revenue raisers by the Joint Committee on \n     Taxation. These proposals have no impact on the budget \n     deficient.\n       The budget resolution assumes that 2.5 cents per gallon of \n     gasohol receipts, currently held by the general fund, will be \n     transferred to the trust fund. That transfer raises trust \n     fund receipts by $5 billion over the authorization period. \n     The Finance Committee also assumed that trust fund balances \n     would be spent down by $7.5 billion over the authorization \n     period. Adding all of these changes together with the \n     compliance changes, the Finance Committee closed the gap by \n     $18.1 billion over the authorization period. That left a \n     funding gap of $21.7 billion.\n       The Finance Committee proposed to close this gap with a \n     group of trust fund accounting changes. These proposals raise \n     trust fund receipts by shifting the burden of tax policies \n     from the trust fund to the general fund. In the view of \n     Finance Committee, these tax policy benefits have nothing to \n     do with highway use and should not burden the trust fund. \n     Included in these proposals is a repeal of the partial \n     exemption for ethanol-blended fuels. The tax benefit for \n     ethanol, like nearly all energy production incentives, is \n     transferred to the general fund through a tax credit. The \n     same effect is applied to refunds for special categories of \n     users such as State and local governments. Finally, the \n     Highway trust Fund will earn interest on its balance, so that \n     the highway and transit programs are not prejudiced. This \n     second category of proposals closed the funding gap, but, \n     without revenue offsets, would have increased the budget \n     deficit by $21.7 billion.\n       Finance Committee members decided that this second category \n     of proposals should not have a deficit impact. To this end, \n     the Finance Committee title includes a group of loophole \n     closers previously approved by the committee.\n       Ninety-five percent cost over $120 billion . . . the cost \n     forced us to construct a new method. Equity Bonus keeps the \n     cost of rectifying donor states affordable.\n\n\n    comparison of nh and vt [both low population states per mccain]\n\n       Response: VT does very well under the formulas for the core \n     programs (not changed from TEA-21 in this bill).

The State of Oklahoma does not. It goes up to 95 cents. \nThe first year, it is 90.5; next year, 91.75; and it gradually goes up. \nYours does not because for the State of Arizona, it hits the ceiling. \nSo you have 90.5 each of the first 4 years, then 90.84, then 95.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mrs. DOLE. Madam President, our transportation infrastructure is one \nof this country's most important investments. It is literally the \nfoundation of America. Each day our roads, bridges, buses, and railways \nhelp countless Americans travel to their jobs, visit a faraway \nrelative, or take a day trip with their kids.\n  As a former Secretary of Transportation, I am constantly in awe of \nthis vast reach of modern-day transportation. I can still recall from \nmy tenure at the Department the completion of the Interstate 40 \ncorridor which runs from Wilmington, NC, to southern California, an \nenormous stretch of highway that literally links us from coast to \ncoast. It is these kinds of investments that are vital to sustaining \nour communities and our economy. By ensuring that our roads, bridges, \nand infrastructure are prepared for the future, we provide economic \nstability. For my home State, that is a crucial component of our \neconomic recovery.\n  As many of you know, North Carolina is going through painful economic \ntimes as traditional textile, furniture, and other manufacturing jobs \nare diminishing. Improving our transportation infrastructure is a vital \npart of getting North Carolina's economy back on track.\n  Let me give an example. Construction is already underway for \nInterstates 73 and 74 in North Carolina, and planning has begun for \nInterstate 20. The Department of Transportation estimates that the \nprojects in this bill would create 86,900 jobs in North Carolina.\n  Further, these roads go through areas that are among the hardest hit \nby economic difficulties, creating jobs especially in rural parts of \nNorth Carolina, where mobility between towns and cities is essential \nfor commerce. These routes of opportunity make our communities more \nattractive to businesses and promote investment in our neighborhoods.\n\n  Additionally, there is an 89 percent increase in funding to address \nNorth Carolina's growing transit needs, with a special emphasis on our \nrural areas. This money can be used to provide more buses as our rural \nresidents travel from home to work each day. And for urban areas, such \nas Raleigh, Greensboro, and Charlotte, I am proud that the Banking \nCommittee on which I serve has included much-needed dollars to relieve \ncongestion by investing in buses, street cars and, in some cases, light \nrail.\n  We all know that relieving congestion creates a cleaner environment, \nimproves worker productivity, combats stress, and gives employees more \ntime with their families and less time struggling with a long commute.\n  This legislation also addresses a problem that exists with the \nhighway trust fund. Right now, North Carolina gets just 90.5 cents for \nevery dollar we put into the trust fund. This legislation guarantees \nthat North Carolina's share will increase to 95 cents over the next 5 \nyears. That will mean an additional $50 million a year for \ntransportation construction, and we all know how much good can be done \nwith those dollars.\n  The bill also expands the Small Starts program to include mass \ntransit projects under $75 million. My State and local leaders' biggest \ncomplaint is the mounds of paperwork and regulatory hurdles that must \nbe completed, even for the smallest transportation project. It simply \nis not fair that these smaller projects must jump through the same \nlarge hoops as the biggest projects in the United States. The Small \nStarts project will allow for simpler, less costly review of these \nprojects, and that is good news for our States.\n  Now let me touch on another area of the legislation that is near and \ndear to my heart. Safety was at the forefront during my 5 years as \nSecretary of Transportation. Our rule 208, as we called it at \nTransportation, encouraged the passage of State seatbelt laws and the \ninclusion of passive restraints in new cars.\n  In 1984, there were only a handful of airbag-equipped cars on the \nroad. Not a single manufacturer was currently offering airbags at that \ntime. I remember a long search for a car with an airbag to use in a \ndemonstration on the White House lawn. But today that number stands at \n40 million. And as we all now know, airbags save lives and prevent \ncrippling, disabling injuries. At that time, in 1984, there was only a \n14 percent usage rate for seatbelts, and there was not one single State \nseatbelt law in the United States.\n  Our regulation 208 helped change all of that. Today, 49 States and \nthe District of Columbia have seatbelt laws. As of 1998, the national \nseatbelt use rate was 69 percent. Some States, such as my home State of \nNorth Carolina, have a use rate of over 80 percent. It is estimated \nthat 11,900 fatalities and 325,000 serious injuries are prevented each \nand every year due to usage. It is said that rule 208 literally changed \nthe climate of highway safety in America.\n  It was also a privilege back then to work with my friend, Senator \nFrank Lautenberg, to champion legislation encouraging States to raise \ntheir drinking age to 21, thereby helping to eliminate drunk driving \nand blood borders between our States.\n  There are many safety provisions included within this bill. Funding \nis there to ensure that our secondary roads are safer, something that \nis vitally important to rural areas. Too often accidents occur on the \nsmall two-lane secondary roads, in many cases leaving death and \ndestruction in their wake. The money in this bill will make those roads \nsafer for our families and our children.\n  There are also provisions for installing skid-resistant surfaces at \nintersections, traffic signal upgrades, and improvement in pedestrian \nand bicyclist safety. All of these are sorely needed. Safety on our \nroads must continue to be a priority.\n  Madam President, it is imperative we act now to pass this critical \nlegislation. I urge my colleagues to support it. It is a win-win for \nall of our States, for businesses, and especially for the millions of \nAmericans who rely on our transportation infrastructure each and every \nday.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, first, before the Senator from North \nCarolina leaves, I want to say we are very fortunate to have her \nexpertise having served as Secretary of Transportation and in other \ncapacities where she provided leadership. She has an understanding of \ntransportation needs probably greater than any other single person in \nthis Chamber. I thank her for her contributions here.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator from Minnesota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I want to discuss a couple of amendments I \nintend to offer if the opportunity arises in the next couple of days.\n  I thank the bill's managers, Senator Inhofe and the ranking member, \nSenator Jeffords, for standing up against what I believe are very \nmisguided attempts to take a meat cleaver to this very important bill. \nIt is terribly unfortunate that immediately following the most recent \nbudget projections, which show enormous deficits for this year and for \nthe years thereafter, the very first legislation that comes to the \nfloor is this one that provides transportation funding for the next 6 \nyears.\n  This is not, I urge my colleagues, the place to economize. To do so \nin this bill would be penny wise and pound idiotic. It would be kind of \nlike a person who was told by his doctor he has to lose weight and he \ndecides to eliminate fruits and vegetables. These are public \ninvestments in our Nation's highways, bridges, rail lines, and mass \ntransit systems. They are critical to our social and economic \nvitality--moving products quickly to market; moving people swiftly, \nsmoothly, and safely to jobs, schools, and family activities, and then \nback home again. These are critical investments in the future of our \ncountry. They are termed capital investments, which means they are \nprojects which themselves generate future wealth.\n  People say we ought to operate Government more like a business, and I \nagree. They should recognize that successful businesses regularly go \ninto debt to finance their capital projects.\n\n[[Page S1003]]\n\nBuilding new plants, expanding or modernizing existing facilities are \ngood and necessary reasons to incur debt.\n\n  Most State and local governments also issue debt--public bonds to \nfinance their capital projects. They use current receipts for ongoing \noperations or consumption. In the Federal Government, we are doing the \nopposite. We are going seriously into debt to pay for current programs \nand consumption and treating our capital improvement budget, such as \nthis transportation bill, as if it were the same program spending. It \nis not.\n  Bankers and brokers understand that difference. Homeowners, farmers, \nand business owners understand that difference. State government \nofficials understand that difference. Why can't this administration and \nCongress understand that difference?\n  That understanding is important because this is a bill where we need \nto think bigger, not smaller. Unless my colleagues' States are in very \ndifferent conditions, and their highways, bridges, rail lines, mass \ntransit systems are in much better shape than my State of Minnesota's, \nthen they have the same critical shortage of funding as Minnesota.\n  In my State, the conditions and capacities of our highways and other \npublic infrastructure have been declining over the last decade, and \nthey are going to continue to do so without this additional infusion of \nFederal money. Our State and local governments simply do not have, and \nthey are not going to have in the future, the increasing amounts of \nfunding necessary to keep up with or catch up with growing populations \nand increased usage. It is only here in the Federal Government that we \nhave the resources--at least we did until a couple years ago, before \nthe budget surpluses were turned into deficits. But even now, we still \nhave the resources, though not to do everything. It comes down to what \nare our priorities. What and who do we consider most important?\n  The President has made his priorities very clear. He has made making \nthe 2001 and 2003 tax rates permanent the centerpiece of his budget and \nhis economic recovery strategy. If so, we are going to be waiting quite \na while for that recovery because the President's proposal won't even \ntake effect until the expiration dates for the change now already in \nplace; and for the 2001 tax bill items, that will be the year 2010. For \nthe 2003 items, most of those won't be extended until the years 2006, \n2007, and beyond.\n  This bill before us today is the best economic stimulus bill and jobs \ncreation bill possible for right now--not 2006 or 2010, but right now--\nin Minnesota and across America, which is why the funding level for \nthis bill ought to be increased, not decreased.\n  I had an amendment I would like to offer--although it flies in the \nface of reality--to double the amount of Federal funding that was \nprovided 6 years ago, which was $218 billion, to increase that to $436 \nbillion. That contrasts with the Senate bill now of $311 billion and \nthe House bill of $375 billion, although I would not increase the \namount by increasing the gasoline tax as is being proposed in the \nHouse. I would fund mine through the general fund, dedicate the \nrevenues from the highway trust fund into the purposes they are being \nused for, but not use that as a ceiling for funding the necessary \npublic infrastructure. That would be a business such as Target \nCorporation deciding the number of new stores it is going to build in \nthe next few years is going to be a function of some formula, such as \nthe percentage or revenues from socks or shorts that are being sold; \nand if somebody, for fashion reasons, decides they are going to go \nsockless for a year, that number goes down and so does the investment \nin new stores go down. No sensible business would make future \ninvestment decisions based on this kind of formula and be dictated by \nthat result.\n  In this case, as well, we should be deciding as a body, with the \nHouse and the administration, what level of public investment we need \nto make in highways and mass transit systems over the next 6 years--\nmake that decision based on the needs and then decide how we are going \nto fund it.\n  Again, we do these things backward here and, as a result, we don't \nmake the commitment that will pay off for this Nation if we do it, and \nwe will sacrifice the future of our highways and airports and rail \nlines if we don't do it.\n  While recognizing it is unlikely to be adopted by this Senate, \nespecially in the face of the President's insistence that even the \nSenate number be reduced further--again, I salute Senator Inhofe and \nSenator Jeffords for standing resolutely in favor of this and being the \nfiscal conservatives they are. They recognize these are public \ninvestments that are vital, and to fail to make them would be--at least \nfor Minnesota--virtually catastrophic. I thank the Chairman and ranking \nmember for their steadfastness in supporting this and the level of \ncommitment it makes.\n  I also am proud to be a cosponsor of the Build America Bonds Act, \nwhich is being sponsored by Senator Talent of Missouri and Senator \nWyden of Oregon, because if we are not going to use public dollars \ndirectly for these projects, then another way to finance them would be \nfor the Federal Government to issue bonds and provide tax credits to \nthose who purchase the bonds.\n  The proposal made by Senators Talent and Wyden would issue another \n$50 billion of Federal bonds that would be then used throughout the \nStates to advance these projects. If we are not going to use general \nrevenue dollars or highway trust fund dollars sufficiently to meet the \nneeds, then we ought to incorporate bonding in addition to what is \nbeing funded elsewhere.\n  I also thank Senator Grassley, the chairman of the Senate Finance \nCommittee, for his initiative in the legislation for correcting what is \nessentially a penalty to those States, such as Iowa and Minnesota, that \nhave been using ethanol as part of their fuel.\n  In Minnesota, we have had for the last 8 years a requirement that 10 \npercent of every gallon of gasoline sold in our State be comprised of \nethanol. Right now, nationwide it is less than 2-percent ethanol in \nproportion to gasoline. If you listen to some of my colleagues, they \nwould have you believe the use of ethanol is going to drive prices for \ngasoline or its substitute through the roof when, in fact, the opposite \nis true.\n  I use in my car in Minnesota with a slight engine modification made \nby the manufacturer, a Ford Explorer, a fuel that consists of 85-\npercent ethanol and 15-percent gasoline. That is 20 cents a gallon \ncheaper in southern Minnesota than regular unleaded. It runs just as \nwell. The vehicle performs just as well.\n  If we want to reduce the $115 billion a year we send overseas to pay \nfor the foreign oil we import, there is no more readily available way \nto do that than to increase the use of ethanol. I regret, because of \nsome of the opposition to that, that Senator Frist's and Senator \nDaschle's amendment to increase the use of ethanol over the next decade \nin this country by a very modest amount is not going to be offered as \nan amendment to this legislation. Hopefully, it can be considered by \nthe Senate and passed as a separate measure in the very near future.\n  The use of ethanol in the current formula penalizes States for that \nconsumption. Again, I thank Senator Grassley and also the ranking \nmember of the Senate Finance Committee, Senator Baucus, for their \ninitiative. It is going to be vital from my standpoint that the measure \npassing the Senate and the conference report include that correction.\n  I also will have two amendments I hope I will have the opportunity to \noffer. One is a rural roads safety amendment which I developed with the \nsupport of the National Association of Counties. It will provide \nadditional funding. The amendment itself calls for $1 billion a year \nover the 6-year lifespan of this bill. This would be additional funding \nto provide for programs to improve the safety of our rural roads across \nthe country.\n  More than 25,000 people die each year on our rural roads system. It \nis a fatality rate that is 2\\1/2\\ times greater than that for urban \nhighways. In fact, it is the highest rate of fatalities per vehicle \nmile for any type of transportation in this country.\n  Despite this need on some 840,000 miles of rural two-lane roads, \nfunding directed from this bill in the past has provided very little \ndirect assistance to rural communities which, in my State at least, \nhave the least capacity to undertake these expensive projects.\n  This funding would provide for improving roadway alignments, \neliminating wheel way rutting, including\n\n[[Page S1004]]\n\nskid resistance, widening lanes and shoulders, installing dedicated \nturn lanes--whatever the State and particularly the county and local \nunits of government decide are in their best interest.\n  It is also being introduced in the House by Representative Bob Ney \nwho is the chairman of the House Administration Committee. I hope it \nwill receive favorable consideration in the next few hours.\n  The other amendment I would like to offer is a mandate for the \nFederal vehicle fleet to use either 10-percent ethanol-blended gasoline \nor biodiesel fuel, 2 percent or more where it is available and where it \nis at a generally competitive price. The amendment would apply to some \n650,000 Federal vehicles everywhere except for the Department of \nDefense and the military, and it provides the opportunity for the \nFederal Government to take the leadership in encouraging the use of \nethanol and biodiesel fuels by its own practices.\n  These are, as I said earlier, fuels that will add to our rural \neconomic recovery to increase the prices of commodities, such as corn \nand soybeans, in the marketplace which raises profits for farmers and \nlowers subsidy costs for taxpayers. They are cleaner burning fuels than \noil-derived fuels, and they put money in the pockets of Americans \nrather than foreigners.\n  This amendment, as well, I hope, will be considered favorably by this \nbody. It is not going to increase costs. In fact, if anything, based on \nmy experience with ethanol, it is going to lower costs, and it is going \nto provide a real boost to the rural economy of America.\n  In closing, I wish to say again that this legislation is crucial for \nMinnesota. It is crucial for our Nation. That is why tomorrow I am \ngoing to vote in favor of the cloture motion to proceed to this measure \nand move to pass it in the Senate. Hopefully, the House will follow \nsuit as well so we can get this bill passed and signed by the President \nand into effect and get this money to the States where it can be well \nused and be an economic stimulus and provide jobs.\n  I hope during the course of that consideration I will have an \nopportunity to offer these amendments.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I wish to take an opportunity to respond to \nsome of the statements made by the distinguished junior Senator from \nArizona, my friend Mr. Kyl. I have the greatest respect for him. He is \na neighbor of the State of Nevada. We have worked well together in many \ndifferent areas, but his statement regarding this highway bill is \nsimply off base.\n  I respectfully suggest that maybe we should understand that there are \nthree separate but equal branches of Government. We have a \nresponsibility in the legislative branch of Government to do what we \nthink is right for the people of our respective States. I think we have \ndone as well as we can do for the people of this country.\n  The Presiding Officer has been a Governor of 1 of our 50 sovereign \nStates. I think he would--I have not spoken with him--have recognized \nduring his tenure as Governor how very important the highway programs \nwere in the State of Tennessee.\n  In this legislation that is now before this body, the State of \nTennessee is going to do extremely well with this bill. The State of \nTennessee, which has been a State that has given far more than it has \ntaken in--that is, in the State of Tennessee, for every dollar paid \ninto that fund, the people of Tennessee have contributed 10 cents out \nof every dollar to the rest of the country. The people of Tennessee \nhave not gotten what some think is a fair shake in this legislation.\n  There was an effort to bring every State, including the State of \nTennessee, to 95 cents in this bill. The State of Tennessee, rather \nthan getting the 90 cents on the dollar previous to this bill being \nenacted, will get an average of 94.25 cents for every year this bill is \nin effect, and, in the final year, it will get 95 percent. That is a \ntremendous boon to the State of Tennessee.\n  We have done that for every State in the Union that in the past was \npaying into the trust fund far more than they were getting.\n  The State of Arizona also gets 95 cents on the dollar. My friend, the \nSenator from the State of Arizona, is complaining because we don't do \nit fast enough.\n  I want everyone to know how very difficult it was to get a formula \nthat would bring every State up to 95 percent at the end of this sixth \nyear. It was extremely difficult. So I would respectfully suggest to my \nfriend from Arizona he should be complimenting us rather than saying he \ndoes not like what we have. In years past, we would not worry about the \nState of Arizona and the State of Tennessee. What we would do was see \nif we had the votes and just roll over everybody. That was how we used \nto do this. This is my fourth bill. That was how we used to do things, \nbut we are not doing that this year. We are trying to be fair.\n  Rather than being critical of what we have done to bring everyone up \nto 95 percent by saying we did not do it soon enough, we should be \ncomplimented. Frankly, we could do this bill without the States of \nArizona and Tennessee. We could do without those four votes. But we \ndecided to be fair and to do everything we could to allow a minimum at \nthe end of this year.\n  So I repeat for the third time, rather than being castigated for not \nbringing up the 95 percent sooner, I think the people of the State of \nArizona--I know the people in the Department of Transportation--are \nhappy with what they have. This is going to be a wonderful thing for \nthe State of Arizona.\n  I really do not recognize tears shed by a State that is growing \nrapidly. The State of Nevada beats all States. We have grown more \nrapidly in the last 14 years than any State in the Union. We hold the \nrecord. We are the fastest growing State in the Union. So when someone \nsays they are a rapidly growing State and should be treated \ndifferently, we also understand what it means to grow fast. We believe \nwe have treated Arizona very fairly.\n  This is probably more difficult for someone in the majority to say \nbut it is not hard for me to say: I dare the President to veto this \nbill. He is not going to veto this bill. This letter we have, this \nstatement of administration policy, comes to us all kinds of times on \nvarious types of legislation. President Clinton sent us threats. \nPresident Bush sends us threats. That is what they are. The President \nwill not veto the biggest jobs bill during his entire 4 years in \noffice. He is not going to do it. I do not care if it is the number we \nhave in this bill or the one Chairman Young from the House wants. He \nwants $270 billion. Ours is $255 billion. This bill will not be vetoed \nby President Bush, and my colleagues can take that to the bank.\n  My friend from Arizona also says he is disturbed that because we got \nthe money for this bill, he wants to make sure the World Trade \nOrganization does not punish us. I wish they would punish us and kick \nus out of the World Trade Organization. I do not want to be part of the \nWorld Trade Organization. So that does not sell too well with me.\n  So I repeat, States have been treated very fairly in this bill. We \nare going to be able to invoke cloture on this bill because it is the \nright thing to do.\n  I understand the legislative process. We are going to pass a bill; \nthe House, in their wisdom, will pass a bill; and it will go to \nconference. We will try to prevail in what we want. The House will try \nto prevail in what they want. When they are invited, which I am sure \nwill be often, the administration will be expressing their views at the \nconference. Then we will have a bill and it will be sent to the \nPresident's desk. That is how the process works.\n  It is way too early to be threatening a veto. This is done lots of \ntimes. I do not think anyone should be quaking in their boots over a \nstatement of administration policy. They probably have a stack of these \nstatements of administration policy left over from the Clinton \nPresidency that is that high. They just peel these out on probably two-\nthirds of the bills we have.\n  I have been around for awhile. I am not impressed with this statement \nof administration policy because the administration knows, everybody in \nthis body knows, that this is one step, but an extremely important \nstep, in a very long effort to get this bill to the President's desk. \nWe will get it to the President's desk. It will not be easy, but what \nhas been accomplished has been very important to the process.\n\n[[Page S1005]]\n\n  As I said earlier, this bill should be a picture for the American \npeople. We are working in the Senate in a bipartisan fashion to produce \na bill that is good for the American people. It is a bill that I have \nsaid before is imperfect. It is not perfect. It is difficult to do.\n  This is the bill. I can hardly lift it. I guess that shows how weak I \nam, but it is still a pile of paper. This stack of it is the highway \nportion of it. Another stack of it is the transit portion of the bill, \nand then the finance portion. This has been a year in the making. It \nhas been extremely difficult to do.\n  For someone to come to the floor and say what we need to do now is \nhave a 1-year extension--I do not think so. In the process, we would \nlose hundreds of thousands of jobs by extending this a year. The \nPresiding Officer knows that the planning department and the \ndepartments of transportation for every State in the Union have to do \nmultiyear planning. There cannot be a transportation system in a State \non a year-to-year basis. Some of these projects take years to complete, \nand if we stall for another year, it is going to make the projects more \nexpensive. They will cost more money, not less money.\n  So I understand that my friend from Arizona comes here all the time \nas a spokesperson for the administration. He does it on lots of issues. \nI respect his being someone who answers the beck and call of the \nadministration. He is here on so many different issues spouting what \nthe administration wants, but we are legislators and we will get to the \nWhite House, the administration, in due time to work this out.\n  I repeat, we are a separate but equal branch of Government and this \nis not the time for the President--rather, the President's people; I \nshould not use his name--to be waving all of these threats.\n  My friend from Arizona talks about these deficits. Well, my \ncolleagues have heard us on this side talk about why we think the \ndeficits are there, but in this legislation we have not talked about \nall the bad things and all the negative things that we believe the \nmajority party is doing and the majority has not talked about all the \nbad things they think we are doing. This has been a bipartisan rush to \nscore a touchdown and take this bill to the House and see what they do \nto respond.\n  I hope they can do it quickly, and I am confident they will. They can \nusually move things much more quickly than we can and then we work out \na process to work out the differences between the House and the Senate \nand move this thing to the White House. It can be done and it really \nhas to be done; we have no choice. This transportation bill is \nimportant for the American people. As the Senator from Mississippi, the \ndistinguished former majority leader and minority leader, Mr. Lott, \nsaid on this floor this week, there will not be more important \nlegislation we deal with this entire year than this legislation. This \nis the most important thing we are going to deal with, and I agree with \nthe junior Senator from Mississippi, this is the most important \nlegislation we have to deal with.\n  I compliment and applaud the chairman of the committee, the ranking \nmember of the committee, my counterpart, the chairman of the \nsubcommittee. We have worked well together. I think we have set an \nexample for what the Senate should be, could be, and I hope will be in \nthe future.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, in response to the threat to \nend the debate on the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, and Efficient \nTransportation Equity Act of 2003--the acronym is SAFETEA--I rise in \nopposition to cloture on this legislation. I do so for several reasons.\n  First, I believe strongly that increasing investment in our Nation's \ninfrastructure--our transportation system, our water and sewer systems, \nour electric grids, our crumbling schools--is critical to our Nation's \nfuture well-being. Today, we are debating one of the keystones of that \ninvestment--transportation, highways, public transit, and rail.\n  Transportation is an integral part of everyone's daily life. It is an \nintegral part of America's current and future economic well-being. \nFederal investments in transportation infrastructure increase our \neconomic vitality and our international competitiveness.\n  I believe the key question for the foreseeable future of America is \nhow we maintain America's standard of living while at the same time \ncompeting in a global marketplace where lowest unit cost of production \nis the holy grail. That is going to be a significant challenge to our \ngeneration and to future generations of Americans.\n  I don't think there is any easy answer, but I believe the answer \nbegins with an investment in three things:\n  No. 1 is innovation. America must continue to be the leading edge on \nwhatever the next wave of technological progress will be in this world.\n  No. 2, we must have the best educated citizenry in the world so that \nthey in turn can be the most efficient.\n  No. 3, we must invest in our infrastructure, not just because it \ncontributes to our daily quality of life but because it is a critical \nfactor in our productivity and ability to compete in the world.\n  We are having a big controversy now over what the elements of \nAmerica's long-term economic future are. We have people saying \noutsourcing jobs is going to be the key to our economic success. We \nhave others who say various forms of tax policy. They, in my opinion, \nmiss the point. We have to invest in those things that will make us \nmore productive, and infrastructure is one of the keys to that \nprogress.\n  I think there are three factors by which you evaluate the legislation \nthat is before us:\n  No. 1, increasing Federal investment in infrastructure to avoid a \nfurther decline in the highway network and to reduce congestion.\n  No. 2, assuring that users pay for the highway system to avoid \nadditions to America's burgeoning deficit.\n  No. 3, greater fairness among the States.\n  I am concerned that SAFETEA will shortchange the American people on \nall three factors.\n  First, what should be the goal of transportation funding? From a \nnumber of the speeches I have heard on the Senate floor and in \ncommittees, it appears as if the debate is over numbers. The President \nsaid he will veto any bill that exceeds his proposal of $206 billion \nfor highways over the next 6 years. Senator Inhofe, chairman of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, said cutting funding below the \n$255 billion level for highways would place the allocation of funds \namong the States in jeopardy. Congressman Don Young, chairman of the \nHouse Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, is advocating a \nlevel of $300 billion over the next 6 years for highways.\n\n  What I think is missing in all of these pronouncements is an \nevaluation of what these numbers mean to the condition of America's \nhighways over the 6-year life of this legislation.\n  When the Transportation Act for the 21st Century--TEA-21--was \napproved in 1998, I stood on this floor and predicted that when the \nbill expired in 2003, our Nation's transportation system would be in \nworse physical condition and with a higher level of congestion than on \nthe day we passed the bill. That prediction has, unfortunately, come to \npass.\n  According to the U.S. Department of Transportation's Conditions and \nPerformance Report, capital investment by all levels of government \nbetween 1997 and 2000 remained below the cost to even maintain the \nsystem we currently have. The result? Overall performance of the system \ndeclined.\n  Since the passage of TEA-21, the highway system has degraded by 6 \npercent. Twenty-three percent of the highways in the Nation's urban \nareas are now considered ``unacceptable'' by the standards of U.S. \nDepartment of Transportation. Twenty-nine percent of the Nation's \nbridges are considered structurally deficient or in a deteriorating \ncondition.\n  Additionally, according to the annual congestion study by the Texas \nTransportation Institute at Texas A University, the agency to which \nthe U.S.\n\n[[Page S1006]]\n\nDepartment of Transportation looks for the evaluation of congestion, \nthe average commute delay in urban areas has increased by 14.3 percent \nsince 1998. This means the commute that used to take 25 minutes in 1998 \nwill now add an extra 2 hours per month to the commute of the average \nAmerican.\n  I will make the same prediction today that I made in 1998; that is, \nif the Senate adopts the funding levels currently in this bill, our \nNation's highways will be in worse physical condition, with increased \ncongestion, by the end of this authorization in the year 2009 than it \nis today, February 11, 2004.\n  The failure to address these conditions in the past has created the \nsituation we must address in the future. By the U.S. Department of \nTransportation estimate, by the year 2009 we will face an additional \n$400 billion in infrastructure backlog and congestion costs will \nballoon to over $90 billion. We are not even able to maintain the \ncurrent quality of our roads under the SAFETEA authorization level.\n  In order to maintain the highway system in its current level of \nfiscal condition and without increasing congestion, the American \nAssociation of State Highway and Transportation Officials estimates \nthat investment of $92 billion a year by Federal, State, and local \ngovernments, close to $300 billion of that Federal, will be required \nover each of the next 6 years. In addition, our problem is compounded \nby the distinguished majority leader's statement yesterday that \nSAFETEA, already inadequate, must be trimmed to avoid a Presidential \nveto.\n  We are now at a point of decision. Are we prepared to tell the \nAmerican people we are willing to accept a further deterioration of our \nhighways and bridges and increased congestion? If we have the same \nexperience over the next 6 years that our highway system has \nexperienced in the last 6 years, we will see a degradation from 1998 to \n2009 of approximately 12 percent and a commute delay will increase 30 \npercent.\n  Is this an acceptable result for the safety, the quality of life, and \nthe economic expectations of the American people? In my judgment, the \nanswer is clear. The answer is no.\n  The President supports an even more accelerated rate of decline in \nthe conditions and congestions of our highway system than SAFETEA. He \nhas insisted that the highway portion of SAFETEA be funded at $206 \nbillion, roughly 65 percent of what is required just to maintain our \nhighway systems at their current levels. We must do more. We cannot \ncontinue to ignore the problem and allow a critical component in our \nquality of life and our economic future to deteriorate.\n  I have a second concern. As I stated, a fundamental principle is \nusers should pay for the use they get of our transportation system. \nThat has been a principle throughout our Nation's history, particularly \nwhen we launched the Interstate Highway System. President Eisenhower \nincreased the Federal motor fuels tax in order to be able to finance \nthe Interstate Highway System, not leave it as a burden for our \nchildren and grandchildren and we, this generation of Americans, are \nthe beneficiary of that wise judgment.\n  During the Finance Committee consideration of SAFETEA last week, I \ndiscussed the option of raising the Federal motor fuel user fees to \nfund the bill at the level needed to maintain current conditions. Many \nof my colleagues were not comfortable with the idea of increased fees, \nraising the Federal user fee just 3.7 cents per gallon. That is what we \nwould be required if it were indexed for inflation to fully fund a \nFederal program of the $300 billion over the next 6 years, which is \nrequired to at least maintain the status quo in the quality of our \nhighways.\n  Again, President Bush has made it very clear he will not support any \nhighway bill that is financed by an increase in user fees, by bonding, \nor by funding from the general fund. I am sorry to hear the President \nneither supports funding the Nation's infrastructure at the levels \nrecommended by his own Department of Transportation, nor does he \nsupport the principle that the users of the system should support the \nlevels of investment needed to maintain and improve our highways.\n  If we are not willing to fund the SAFETEA bill at the appropriate \nlevel to maintain their current condition and reduce or maintain the \ncurrent levels of congestion--to do as the first principle of a \nphysician ``do no harm,'' to the system--if we are unwilling to do \nthat, maybe we should not be considering a 6-year bill at all. Instead, \nthe Senate should work on a 1-year extension of the current program \nwith a commitment to work on a more substantial long-term bill next \nyear after the Presidential elections.\n\n  We are not willing to raise fees on those who use our highways but \ninstead have approved ``offsets'' for the spending in SAFETEA. But many \nquestions about how the deficit will be affected as a result of these \noffsets remain. Last week, the Finance Committee equalized losses to \nthe general fund by using offsets from what already had been used. For \nexample, $22.3 billion worth of already committed tax changes. One \noffset used is a crackdown on corporate tax shelters, a policy that I \nhave long supported. However, this offset has already been used in two \nother pieces of legislation approved by the committee and awaiting \nfinal action by the Congress--the charitable giving or CARE Act and the \nJOBS Act, which is our response to the WTO abolition of our current \nmeans of financing international transactions and other tax provisions, \nsuch as ending the tax bills that come with incorporating in other \ncountries to avoid paying taxes, eliminating tax benefits for \nindividuals who expatriate for tax reasons, and closing tax loopholes \nuncovered as a result of the Enron scandal again. But, again, these \nwere the provisions that have already been used to fund other \nlegislation.\n  The fiscal imprudence does not end with using offsets that have \nalready been previously used. The bill also employs a gimmick of \nrequiring corporations to pay their 2009 taxes in order to make it \nappear in the year 2008 we have raised a sufficient amount of revenue \nover the 6-year period of the bill. Obviously, the consequences are we \nwill start the next 6 years in the hole because we used money through \nan accounting gimmick to make it appear as if it were revenue within \nthis 6-year cycle.\n  These overpaid corporate taxes will ultimately be refunded, however, \nmeaning we do not really offset the cost of the bill over the period \nthat the highway spending occurs. This is shady bookkeeping, \nreminiscent of the procedures that this body worked so hard in the \nrecent past to reform in the private sector.\n  Is it fair to offset the spending in this bill with already used \nrevenue raisers or accounting gimmicks? It is duplicative at least, \nirresponsible at worst. We must legitimately pay for this bill.\n  Third, I have fought for many years to create a funding structure \nthat is based on equity, on providing States that face the highest \nlevel of need with their fair share of Federal funds. This bill has a \nfatal flaw. It creates a formula for highway funding that has \nabsolutely no solid basis in rationale public policy.\n  In my State of Florida, traffic delays cost the average motorist in \nour eight largest cities $485 per year in lost time and fuel. By the \nyear 2020, Florida will add about 6 million new residents, doubling its \ninternational trade, and welcome more than 100 million tourists per \nyear. This additional growth will multiply congestion and delay \ntremendously.\n  This is only a snapshot of the growing problems in my State and not \nan uncommon story for many States in the South and West.\n  Over the past 15 years, America's population has grown by 18 percent. \nFlorida's population has grown at twice that rate, 39 percent. Vehicle \nmiles traveled, a good measure of the use of our highway system, has \ngrown by 48 percent nationally but 90 percent in Florida. Lane miles, a \nmeasure of the extent of the system, have grown less than 10 percent \nnationally over the last decade, and only 11 percent in Florida in the \nface of a 90-percent growth in the use of our highway system.\n  High growth States all face similar circumstances. In 1982, just 10 \nof the 25 most congested areas pursuant to the Telecommunications \nTransportation Institute study were located in high-growth areas such \nas Maryland, Colorado, Texas, Arizona, California, and Florida. Today, \n15 of the most congested areas in the Nation are in those\n\n[[Page S1007]]\n\nStates. But the funding formula we are considering has failed to catch \nup with this reality.\n  Under SAFETEA, these growth States are continuing to receive the \nlowest level of return on contributions to the highway fund, despite \ntheir obvious and growing needs.\n  This bill attempts to get these States to 95 percent by providing \nwhat is referred to as an equity bonus. But the equity bonus, \nunfortunately, does not cover all the funds available for distribution. \nAnd it will keep our State at the TEA-21 level return of 90.5 cents for \nevery dollar sent to the Federal motor fuels trust fund until the year \n2009.\n  Most important, however, is this entire concept assures that an \nunfair scheme will remain in place. All States should be guaranteed \nequal treatment with a formula that incorporates a yearly increase in \nthe rate of return or the glidepath to get all States to a 95-percent \nreturn on the amount of funds they send to the motor fuel tax by 2009.\n  The bill we voted out of committee was significantly different from \nthe bill we will vote on here on the Senate floor. The pending \ncommittee amendment exceeds 1,300 pages and includes significant \nchanges from the status of the bill as it left the committees. This \nmeans the formulas which have been circulated by the committees of \njurisdiction at the start of the debate no longer reflect the state of \nthe bill.\n  For example, what effect will the Finance Committee's actions have on \nState-by-State allocations? A provision approved by the Finance \nCommittee to change the way gasohol is taxed will change each State's \ncontribution levels to the highway trust fund.\n  Will any of the amendments accepted by the managers of the bill \naffect the equity bonus, diluting the rate of return to our States?\n  This seems to be part of a disturbing trend in this body. Whether it \nis the energy bill, the prescription drug bill, or now it seems the \ntransportation bill, there is a tendency to pass things now and ask the \ntough questions later. That practice is unacceptable in the world's \ngreatest deliberative body.\n  Before the vote on cloture on SAFETEA, the Senate should be honest \nabout what SAFETEA will do. One, it will guarantee our roads, bridges, \nand transit systems will be in worse shape in 2009 than they are today. \nIs that acceptable? It will increase the size of the Federal deficit. \nIs that acceptable? It will ensure that States will not receive their \nfair share of Federal highway funding. Is that acceptable? The answer \nis no.\n  Are Members of the Senate comfortable moving forward and approving a \nbill this week with open questions about how the formulas work, at what \nlevel the bill will be funded, and how any changes made here on the \nSenate floor will affect the ``delicate balance'' as described by the \nchairman? I am not satisfied. For these reasons, I will oppose cloture.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2311\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of \nSenators Cantwell and Kennedy's amendment to reinstate and extend the \nFederal unemployment insurance program. This measure would provide 6 \nadditional months of financial assistance to thousands of West \nVirginians and millions of Americans who have exhausted their regular \nstate-funded benefits. This support is desperately needed and deserves \nimmediate attention.\n  The Temporary Extended Unemployment Compensation, TEUC, program \nexpired on December 31, 2003. In response to a slowdown in the American \neconomy, Congress created this program in March 2002 to provide \nfederally-funded unemployment benefits to the long-term unemployed who \nwant to work, and who are looking for work, but are unable to find \nemployment in the current economic climate. As all of my colleagues are \naware, Congress extended the program twice, in January and May of 2003 \nrespectively, because jobs remained scarce and new ones were not being \ncreated. Now, with millions of our constituents still looking for work \nand with 90,000 workers exhausting their State-funded benefits each \nweek millions of Americans need our help once again.\n  Over the past two years our economy has suffered through a difficult \nrecession. Recently, however, according to some economic indicators, it \ndoes appear to be turning the corner. At least the data indicates we \nare poised to return to better and improved economic output from years \npast. This is some encouraging news, but it is long overdue. Despite \nstrong economic growth over the last two quarters of 2003 and a surge \nin the financial markets, jobs continue to be hard to find. At this \ntime, there is merely one job opening for every three out of work \nAmericans. This is totally unacceptable. We cannot merely continue to \nmuddle through a ``jobless recovery''--we must get the unemployed the \nrelief they need.\n  Those who oppose extending emergency unemployment insurance have also \nargued that recent improvements in the economy and the labor market \ndemonstrate that the program is no longer needed. How can the \nadministration tout upward trends as a major economic turnaround when \nso many Americans are still struggling so hard just to make ends meet? \nThe White House claims that jobs are one of the administration's \nprimary concerns. Yet, I am troubled that the White House has been \nconspicuously silent about unemployment insurance, which has been \nproven to boost economic output. It has been reported that continuing \nthe Temporary Emergency Unemployment Compensation, TEUC, program would \nbe the single best mechanism to boost the economy, giving the economy a \n$1.73 jolt for each $1 of Federal benefits. Unemployment insurance \nbenefits are excellent stimulus because they aid people who are likely \nto spend additional resources immediately.\n  Opponents to the extension cite a drop in the national unemployment \nrate, among other improvements in the economy, to justify phasing out \nthis program that serves as the final safety net for workers across the \ncountry. It is true that the Nation's unemployment rate has dropped, \nalbeit minimally, over the past few months. But it is clear that these \nnumbers are misleading. A closer look at the numbers reveals that \nthousands of Americans are so frustrated they actually gave up looking \nfor work altogether and dropped out of the labor market. Nearly 15 \nmillion Americans are out of work and the number of long-term \nunemployed remains enormously high, at almost 2 million. Constituents \nin my home State of West Virginia have been particularly vocal about \nthe seriousness of this situation. In January, nearly 1,200 West \nVirginians exhausted their State-funded benefits. That number will jump \nto nearly 7,000 over the next 6 months. If we pass this amendment, more \nthan 8,000 of my constituents would get the help they need and deserve.\n  My offices are taking calls from West Virginians who need such help. \nOne example is a woman who lost her job due to company layoffs. She \ndecided to return to school so that she could learn new skills and \nreenter the workforce better prepared for an uncertain future. My \nconstituent was depending on the TUEC benefit to help finance her \neducation. Without extending these benefits, how will she make ends \nmeet until she finishes her training? I believe that it's a matter of \nthis administration's priorities. And I very much worry we do not have \nour priorities straight.\n  Lack of jobs is the primary culprit. But what is equally troubling is \nthat there is a clear shift of jobs from high-paying industries to \nlower-paying sectors. This fundamental change in the job market was \nprecipitated by a variety of factors. But simply replacing a good, \nsecure, and well-paying position that includes health insurance and \npension benefits with a minimum wage job just doesn't cut it. And \nsadly, it appears as if this administration is content to tout the \ncreation of new low-paying jobs as stimulus, comparable to the 2.6 \nmillion manufacturing jobs that were lost since this President took \noffice. West Virginia alone has lost about 9,800 manufacturing jobs \nover the last few years.\n  Congress must recognize the urgency of this problem. We must move \nquickly to reinstate this program, not only to assist the unemployed, \nbut also because in doing so we will provide our home states with \nadditional resources that will immediately infuse economies across the \ncountry with more spending power.\n  We can afford to help our fellow Americans. Every worker contributes\n\n[[Page S1008]]\n\nto the Unemployment Insurance Trust Funds so that in times of need \nbenefits are available. Failure to act would send a very negative \nmessage to the large number of Americans struggling to make their way \nin this difficult job climate. Not extending benefits is harsh on the \nunemployed and their families.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, for working families in the State of \nConnecticut and across the country, these are hard economic times. \nMillions have lost their jobs, and millions more fear they might lose \ntheirs soon. Outsourcing American service jobs overseas, as the \nPresident's economic advisors suggest, would only add to the \nunemployment rolls and to growing anxieties. What American needs is not \na plan for creating jobs abroad, but a plan for creating jobs here at \nhome.\n  Nearly all sectors have been affected by the national economy's \nsluggish performance during the past 3 years, with job losses across \nthe board. The manufacturing sectors has been hit particularly hard. In \nthe State of Connecticut, nearly 26,400 manufacturing jobs have been \ncut in the past 38 months, and 33,500 since January 2001. Most of these \njobs have gone overseas.\n  In addition to manufacturing job loss, services and high-tech jobs \nare also being sourced outside the United States--to lower cost, lower \nwage countries. The employment trends in this sector are harder to \nquantify, but the impact is no less real. They threaten to put U.S. \ntechnological competitiveness and future economic growth at risk.\n  The Bush administration has done next to nothing to stop this \nhemorrhaging--relying instead on factory photo-ops, toothless trade \nmissions and new organizational charts. The latest comment from \nPresident Bush's top economic advisers that the outsourcing of U.S. \nservice jobs to workers overseas is good for the Nation's economy only \nunderscores the administration's lack of understanding and leadership \non this issue.\n  Instead of policies that shift jobs overseas, we need to create jobs \nin this country. We need to strengthen enforcement of trade agreements; \nprovide tax credits to keep manufacturing jobs in the United States; \npromote innovation through Federal research and development policy; \nleverage Federal purchasing power; create tax incentives for investment \nin manufacturing modernization and expansion; and strengthen \nmanufacturing and service workers' skills.\n  Today I join my Senate colleagues in sponsoring a resolution that \ntells President Bush--loudly and clearly--we will oppose efforts to \nencourage the outsourcing of American jobs overseas and instead provide \na manufacturing tax incentive to encourage job creation in the United \nStates.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support for S. 1072, \nthe Safe, Accountable, Flexible and Efficient Transportation Equity \nAct, the Senate version of the highway bill, also known as SAFETEA.\n  Few things that we in Congress do this year will have as great of an \nimpact on our fellow citizens as enacting a 6-year successor to the \n1998 Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, TEA-21. Simply \nput, enacting a highway bill this year will create jobs, reduce \ncongestion and cut down on highway fatalities in every city and town \nacross the country.\n  Debate on this bill is long overdue, as TEA-21 originally expired on \nSeptember 30, 2003, and thus it has been necessary to extend these \nprograms until the end of February. The primary reason for this delay \nwas that the Senate was unable to come to an agreement on how to raise \nthe necessary revenue to provide the $311 billion in funding for \nhighways and transit over 6 years that 79 Senators--myself included--\nvoted for as part of the fiscal year 2004 budget resolution.\n  As such, I was pleased to have been able to support, as a member of \nthe Senate Finance Committee, a revenue package that I feel will break \nthe logjam on this issue and allow us to move forward on enacting a \ncomprehensive, 6 year surface transportation bill this year. The \nFinance Committee bill, which was adopted on February 2 by a vote of 17 \nto 4, generates the Senate 6-year funding level without raising the \nFederal gasoline tax, resorting to tax-credit bonds or negatively \nimpacting the general fund.\n  Like many of my colleagues, I would have serious concerns about any \nfinancing proposals that would raise taxes on American consumers and \nsmall businesses, or that would require massive general fund transfers \nfor transportation programs. I commend Chairman Grassley and Senator \nBaucus for navigating through these challenges on highway financing and \nincreasing the likelihood that Congress will get the job done this \nyear.\n  We have a big job to do in a small amount of time. It is critically \nimportant to our State Departments of Transportation that we enact a 6-\nyear bill as soon as possible. States are clamoring for a comprehensive \nhighway bill because, in addition to the funding they stand to get, a \nfull reauthorization allows them to plan for the future. Without such a \nlong-term bill, major projects--including many in my home State--simply \ncannot go forward. It is regrettable that Congress did not complete its \nwork in 2003 by reauthorizing these programs. Thus, we must seize this \nopportunity and fulfill our duty now--another 6-month delay is simply \nnot acceptable.\n  As we debate the appropriate level of spending in this bill, let us \nnot lose sight of the fact that our country's transportation funding \nneeds are simply staggering. If we want to start improving--let alone \nmaintaining--the current system of highways, bridges, and transit \ninfrastructure in this country, overall Federal surface transportation \nspending must reach at least $75 billion annually by fiscal year 2009, \naccording to a 2002 Department of Transportation's, DOT, Conditions and \nPerformance report. The bill before us today provides $255 billion for \nhighways and $56.5 billion transit over six years. To put those numbers \ninto context, they translate into an average annual Federal investment \nof $51.8 billion per year through 2009 under SAFETEA--still far short \nof the figured cited by DOT needed to improve our country's \ntransportation infrastructure.\n\n  While the DOT's 2002 report gives us an idea of the funding levels \nneeded nationwide to enhance our transportation system, I wanted to \nspeak for a moment on the funding needs of my home State of Maine. The \nMaine highway system is the most important facet of a transportation \nnetwork that serves the largest State in the northeastern United \nStates, and totals 22,612 road miles, which includes 367 miles of \ninterstate highways. And as a State with an abundance of islands, \nrivers, lakes and streams, the State of Maine maintains an \nextraordinary number of bridges, including 3,564 highway bridges with \nat least a 10-foot span.\n  Today, Maine's highway system is carrying an ever-growing volume of \nvehicles. Highway use has increased from about 7.5 billion vehicle \nmiles in 1980 to more than 13 billion vehicle miles traveled, VMT, in \n2000. The Maine Department of Transportation's, MDOT, Twenty Year \nTransportation Plan projects that VMT will grow by 18 percent, to about \n16 billion VMT, by the year 2020.\n  Put simply, the most pressing issue facing this extensive \ntransportation system is its age. As MDOT's Twenty Year Plan puts it:\n\n       Our most dramatic challenge is that our infrastructure is \n     aging. Roads, bridges . . . and other facilities that were \n     built decades ago are now reaching, or have surpassed, their \n     life expectancies. In many cases, this translates into the \n     reality that repairs and rehabilitation are no longer \n     appropriate; the time has come for many replacement and \n     reconstruction projects. This is especially true for a \n     significant number of major bridges around the State, some of \n     which offer the only practical and cost-effective method for \n     crossing rivers and other bodies of water.\n\n  Given the challenges facing the State in maintaining its \ntransportation infrastructure, and given that a good road system is \nabsolutely critical to economic development and job creation in both \nrural and urban areas of Maine, I am pleased with the projected funding \nfor Maine in the formula section of S. 1072. Over the 6-year life of \nthe Senate bill, Maine will receive $1.169 billion in highway funding, \nan increase of $292 million, or 33.4 percent, from Maine's 1998 TEA-21 \nfunding. This funding increase is particularly critical when \nconsidering that during the last reauthorization in 1998, when the \naverage State increase was 40 percent, Maine received only a 17 percent \nincrease.\n  I commend Chairmen Inhofe and Bond, and Senators Jeffords and Reid\n\n[[Page S1009]]\n\nfor their careful consideration and hard work on these formulas. In \ndoing so, they have recognized that Maine, as the largest State in New \nEngland in terms of landmass, but with a relatively low population \ndensity, simply needs all the help it can get from the Federal \nGovernment with the costs of maintaining the national highway system\n  While I am certainly optimistic about the funding Maine will receive \nunder the EPW Committee's proposed formulas, I also intend to fight for \n``high priority project'' funding for several Maine road and bridge \nprojects that are in dire need of Federal support. These important \nprojects include the replacement of the 72-year-old Waldo-Hancock \nBridge over the Penobscot River; the Aroostook North-South Highway \nproject to connect the northern part of my State with the terminus of \nI-95 at Houlton; an East-West Highway running from Calais, ME, to the \nNew Hampshire border that will address the woeful state of east-west \nconnectivity in Maine; and the Gorham bypass, a vital congestion \nmitigation project in southern Maine.\n\n  While first-class roads are important for economic development, safe \nroads are just as essential to the quality of life of our citizens. As \nsuch, during the reauthorization process I intend to raise an issue of \nutmost importance to Maine: that of keeping heavy trucks off of our \nlocal roads. Safety must be the No. 1 priority on our roads and \nhighways, and I have long been concerned that the existing interstate \nweight limits in my State have the perverse impact of forcing trucks \nonto State and local secondary roads that were never designed to handle \nheavy commercial trucks safely. These State and local routes are narrow \nroads with narrow lanes, and rotaries, with frequent pedestrian \ncrossings and school zones.\n  Federal law attempts to provide uniform truck weight limits--80,000 \npounds--on the interstate system, but the fact is there are a myriad of \nexemptions and grandfathering provisions. Furthermore, interstate \nhighways have safety features specifically designed for heavy truck \ntraffic, whereas the narrow, winding State and local roads do not.\n  Because of these long-standing safety concerns, MDOT has spent the \nlast several years studying the potential impacts of waiving the \nFederal weight limits throughout the State. The preliminary results of \ntheir study clearly show the wisdom of allowing heavy trucks to travel \non the interstate system rather than local roads. Specifically, MDOT \nestimates that waiving Federal weight limits would result in three \nfewer truck crashes in Maine every year. In addition to the safety \nbenefits, waiving weight limits would save MDOT between $1 million and \n$1.65 million every year on pavement costs, and approximately $300,000 \nper year on bridge rehabilitation costs. Overall, when considering \nsafety and road construction costs, the economic benefit to the State \nand Maine citizens would be between $1.6 million and $2.3 million \nannually.\n  The safety and economic benefits of getting heavy trucks off of Maine \nlocal roads and onto the interstate are enormous. As such, I have filed \nan amendment to the highway bill that would simply direct the Secretary \nof Transportation to establish a 3-year pilot program to improve \ncommercial motor vehicle safety in the State of Maine. Specifically, \nthe measure would direct the Secretary, during this period, to waive \nFederal vehicle weight limitations on certain commercial vehicles \nweighing over 80,000 pounds using the interstate system within Maine, \npermitting the State to set the weight limit. In addition, it would \nprovide for the waiver to become permanent unless the Secretary \ndetermines it has resulted in an adverse impact on highway safety. I \nbelieve this is a measured, responsible approach to a very serious \npublic safety issue.\n  I am aware that the current truck weight limit impacts different \nStates in different ways, but for Maine, at the heart of the issue is a \nsimple question: Do we want heavy trucks on the highway, where they \nbelong, or on local roads running right through the heart of our \ncommunities? I hope to work with the chair and ranking member of the \nEPW Committee to address this issue as we consider the highway bill.\n  Another priority of mine during TEA-21 reauthorization process, as a \nmember of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, \nis the issue of our country's intercity passenger rail system. Until \nDecember 2001, Maine was one of only a handful of States in the \ncontinental United States not served by passenger rail service. I am \nproud that after a decade of hard work and negotiations, Maine has \nbecome a member of the Amtrak family--with service from Boston to \nPortland, Maine. The State of Maine is also working on plans to upgrade \nthe Boston-Portland line to a high-speed rail service, and also may \nextend the line even further north in the future.\n\n  In June 2003, the Commerce Committee--with my support--voted to \nconsider Amtrak reauthorization and TEA-21 reauthorization together. \nSince then, I have been working with a bipartisan coalition of Senators \nto make that proposition a reality, including Senators Hutchison, \nHollings, and Carper. Rail is a part of our surface transportation \nsystem, and I will fight to make sure that a rail title is included in \nthe final highway legislation sent to the President. Simply put, \nincluding a passenger and freight rail title in this bill will build on \nthe existing foundation of passenger rail in Maine and further connect \nmy State to the Nation's transportation system--a prospect about which \nI am very excited.\n  I conclude by saying that another reason I support the legislation we \nare considering today is because it is not just a roads bill, or a \ntransit bill, or a safety bill, it is also a jobs bill. The Department \nof Transportation estimates that every $1 billion in new Federal \ninvestment creates more than 47,500 jobs. The funding in the Senate EPW \ncomprehensive 6-year bill of $255 billion will create approximately 2 \nmillion new jobs nationwide, and will create or sustain almost 57,000 \nhighway-related jobs in my home State of Maine. The economic stimulus \nthis bill will provide is reason alone to enact it as soon as possible.\n  I am pleased that the Senate is poised to complete consideration of \nthis legislation. I look forward to working my colleagues with a sense \nof urgency over the next few days on enacting a comprehensive 6-year \nsurface transportation bill this year.\n\n\n                         Budget Process Reform\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, this amendment contains provisions that \nare within the jurisdiction of the Budget Committee, on which I serve \nas ranking member. Specifically, it amends the Budget Enforcement Act, \nestablishing spending levels for highways and mass transit for fiscal \nyears 2004 through 2009. It also expresses the sense of the Senate that \ncomprehensive budget enforcement measures should be enacted this year, \naddressing discretionary spending, mandatory spending, revenues, and \nall areas of the Federal budget.\n  This bill is not the proper vehicle for considering budget process \nreform. All of the members of the Budget Committee--including those who \nwill not be conferees on the bill pending before us--deserve the \nopportunity to weigh in on discretionary spending caps, pay-as-you-go, \nand other budget enforcement. Those issues should not be presented to \nthe Senate without having been considered by the Budget Committee. They \ntherefore have no place on this bill.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I agree that the pending transportation bill is not the \nplace to consider budget enforcement provisions within the Budget \nCommittee's jurisdiction. Even though the budget enforcement provisions \nin this bill are meaningless in the absence of other process measures, \nI did not support their inclusion. Enacting statutory budget \nenforcement this year will require bipartisan cooperation, and the most \nappropriate way to ensure that is to consider these issues through the \nregular order. I will work closely with the Senator from North Dakota \nto make sure all Senate Budget Committee members have an opportunity to \nprovide input on these issues.\n  Mr. FRIST. I concur with the chairman of the Budget Committee and \nagree with the sentiments expressed by the Committee's Ranking Member. \nIndeed the provisions in this legislation establishing transportation \nspending categories are somewhat meaningless unless we enact broader \nenforcement tools. Those broader enforcement tools\n\n[[Page S1010]]\n\nshould be addressed separate and apart from this legislation.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/11/senate-section/article/S1010-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1010]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Cabralbanuelos\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, these truly are ``the times that try men's \nsouls'' and challenge our resolve as a Nation. Today, it is with \nprofound regret that I stand to pay tribute to a true patriot of \nliberty who gave his life so that others may live in freedom. His name \nwas Juan C. Cabralbanuelos and he was a soldier in the U.S. Army.\n  Many have stood in this chamber to reflect on the loss that our \nNation has felt and the price that it has paid to remain free. Today, I \nstand to remember one who was a citizen of another nation, one who \nloved the United States and freedom so much, he was willing to give his \nlife to preserve an idea: freedom. He truly deserves the honor of being \ncalled an American patriot.\n  Coporal Cabralbanuelos leaves behind a wife Anita and two sons ages \nseven and one. To them, I know that nothing that I say here will temper \nyour grief. But know this: your loss will not go unnoticed and \nunrecognized, your fellow Americans now and always will stand behind \nyou and support you through the trying times ahead.\n  And so another name has been added to Utah's List of Honor: Corporal \nJuan Carlos Cabralbanuelos. He joins an illustrious list that includes \nSpecialist David J. Goldberg, US Army Reserve; Captain Nathan S. \nDalley, West Point graduate and a member of the Army's 1st Armored \nDivision; staff Sergeant James W. Cawley, United States Marine Corps \nReserve; Staff Sergeant Nino D. Livaudais of the Army's Ranger \nRegiment; Randall S. Rehn, of the Army's 3rd Infantry Division; \nSergeant Mason D. Whetstone of the United States Army; and former \nSpecial Forces soldier Brett Thorpe.\n  Their names and the service they performed is something that I shall \nnever forget. I shall always honor them and their families.\n\n\n                       SPECIALIST JUSTIN A. SCOTT\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, today I will take the opportunity to \nhonor the service of Spec. Justin A. Scott of Bellevue, KY. His death \nwhile performing his duty to this country is a great loss to us all.\n  On January 29, 2004, Justin and 11 other soldiers were investigating \na cache of weapons about a hundred miles short of Bagram Air Base in \nAfghanistan. Suddenly, there was an explosion and Justin and seven \nother soldiers were killed. I offer my sincerest condolences to Spec. \nScott's family and loved ones.\n  His service with the 87th Infantry Regiment of the 10th Mountain \nDivision at Ft. Drum, NY, was exemplary and duly appreciated. As one of \nthe U.S. Senators from Kentucky, I know that Spec. Scott served as a \nfine example of what it means to be a true patriot and an American of \nthe highest caliber.\n  We are humbled and honored by the sacrifice Spec. Scott has made. His \nloss reminds us of the heavy cost exacted for our freedom. We must \nremember that the American way of life has been made possible by the \nbravery of men and women like Spec. Scott. When freedom has been \nchallenged many like him have answered the call to arms. We must never \nforget that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/11/senate-section/article/S1010-3", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1010-S1011]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      DAVID KAY'S SENATE TESTIMONY\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, there has been a great deal of focus on the \nrecent Senate testimony of David Kay, the former head of the Iraq \nSurvey Group. Unfortunately, most media reports have highlighted only \nthose statements by Dr. Kay that might be used to criticize the \nadministration. They have largely ignored Dr. Kay's assertions that \nIraq was more dangerous than we even realized prior to the war, that \nSaddam Hussein clearly intended to continue developing weapons of mass \ndestruction, and other statements which contradict the false notion \nthat the administration ``hyped'' intelligence on Iraq.\n  I thought it would be beneficial for the American people to have a \nchance to read Dr. Kay's entire testimony, including his edifying \nexchanges with members of the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n  I therefore ask unanimous consent that his entire testimony be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Hearing, Senate Armed Services Committee, January 28, 2004\n\n       (Joined in progress due to committee hearing room audio \n     system).\n       WARNER: . . . a further report--and I stress a further \n     report--from Dr. David Kay on his efforts and the efforts of \n     the team which he was privileged to work with, known as ISG. \n     He served as the special adviser to the director of Central \n     Intelligence in determining the status of weapons of mass \n     destruction and related programs in Iraq.\n       After assuming this position last July, Dr. Kay made his \n     initial interim official report to this committee on October \n     3rd. As members of the committee are aware, Dr. Kay has \n     stepped down from this position and has been succeeded by Mr. \n     Charles A. Duelfer, a former colleague and member of the U.N. \n     Special Commission with Dr. Kay, who has been appointed by \n     Director Tenet to continue this important mission.\n       I met with Mr. Duelfer the day before yesterday and we just \n     momentarily met with him in the Intel Committee room.\n       Dr. Kay volunteered--and I emphasize that--volunteered to \n     resume his public service, worked diligently for six months \n     in Iraq under difficult and often dangerous conditions, and \n     just concluded his work last week and reported to the \n     director of Central Intelligence.\n       I thank you and I thank your wife for public service.\n       Working with General Dayton and the Iraq Survey Group, ISG, \n     your mission was to search for all facts--repeat, all facts--\n     relevant to the many issues about Iraq weapons of mass \n     destruction and related programs. You initiated what was and \n     continues--I emphasize continues--to be a very difficult, \n     complex mission that, in you own words, is yet to be \n     completed.\n       As you cautioned us when you took up this post in July, \n     patience is required to ensure we complete a thorough \n     assessment of this important issue.\n       In this hearing today we hope to receive your assessment of \n     what has been accomplished to date--I repeat, to date--and \n     what in your professional judgment remains to be done by the \n     ISG. It is far too early to reach any final judgments or \n     conclusions.\n       In recent days, I mentioned, I met with both General \n     Dayton, I've met extensively with your over the recess \n     period, and Mr. Duelfer, and received the assurance of Dayton \n     and Duelfer that they will be prepared to present to the \n     Congress a second official interim report of the ISG group in \n     the time frame of late March.\n       WARNER: It is crucial that the important work of the ISG \n     group go on. Thus far the findings have been significant.\n       Dr. Kay has stated that, although we have not found \n     evidence of large stockpiles of WMD, or forward-deployed \n     weapons, the ISG group have made the following evidence as a \n     part of their record that will be forthcoming: first, \n     evidence of Saddam Hussein's intent to pursue WMD programs on \n     a large scale; actual ongoing chemical and biological \n     research programs; an active program to use the deadly \n     chemical ricin as a weapon, a program that was interrupted \n     only by the start of the war in March; and evidence of \n     missile programs; and evidence that in all probability they \n     were going to build those weapons to incorporate in the \n     warheads, what we know not for sure, but certainly the \n     possibility of weapons of mass destruction; evidence that \n     Saddam Hussein was attempting to reconstitute his fledgling \n     nuclear program as late as 2001; and, most important, \n     evidence that clearly indicates Saddam Hussein was conducting \n     a wide range of activities in clear contravention of the \n     United Nations resolutions.\n       As you recently stated, Dr. Kay--and I quote you--``It was \n     reasonable to conclude that Iraq posed an imminent threat. \n     What we learned during the inspection made Iraq a more \n     dangerous place potentially than, in fact, we thought it was \n     even before the war,'' end quote.\n       WARNER: Further, you said on NBC's ``Today Show'' on \n     Tuesday that it was, quote, ``absolutely prudent for the U.S. \n     to go to war.''\n       Dr. Kay, I concur in those conclusions. I believe a real \n     and growing threat has been eliminated and a coalition of \n     nations acted prudently in the cause of freedom. I'd be \n     interested if you concur in my conclusions.\n\n[[Page S1011]]\n\n       While some have asserted that the president and his senior \n     advisers may have exaggerated or manipulated prewar \n     intelligence on Iraq's WMD programs, Dr. Kay reached the \n     following conclusion, which I think is different.\n       As you stated recently, quote, ``We have to remember that \n     this view of Iraq (prewar assessment of WMD capabilities) was \n     held during the Clinton administration and did not change in \n     the Bush administration. It is not a political got-you issue. \n     Often estimates are different than reality. The important \n     thing is when they differ to understand why,'' end quote.\n       That's precisely why I called this meeting, Dr. Kay, to \n     continue the work of this committee in developing a body of \n     fact from which reasonable people, at the conclusion of that \n     collection of facts, can reach their own objective thoughts \n     and conclusions. It's been a difficult process but the ISG \n     work is not completed.\n       Now, you have stated that you believe there did not exist \n     large stockpiles of biological and chemical weapons. But I \n     hope that you will, in your testimony, indicate that since \n     work is not completed, since Iraq is as big as California and \n     Baghdad approximates the sprawling territory of Los \n     Angeles, that we could find caches and reserves of weapons \n     of mass destruction, chemical or biological or even \n     further evidence about their nuclear program.\n       WARNER: We also would hope that you'd address the question \n     of whether or not Saddam Hussein had some kind of, quote, \n     ``breakout capability'' for quickly producing chemical or \n     biological weapons, and was this not a basis for constituting \n     a conclusion that there was an imminent threat from Saddam \n     Hussein and his military?\n       Why were the Iraq WMD records systemically looted or \n     destroyed? And why do scientists in custody today continue \n     not to be forthcoming if there was nothing to hide or nothing \n     substantial existed?\n       The work of the Iraq Survey Group has shown that Saddam \n     Hussein had WMD intentions, had WMD programs that did \n     survive, and did outwit for 12 years the United National \n     Security Council and the resolutions--indeed, the \n     inspections, in large measure.\n       If ultimately, the findings of the Iraq Survey Group do \n     differ from the prewar assessments of our intelligence \n     community, differ from assessments of the United Nations, \n     differ from assessments of intelligence services of many \n     other nations, indeed that is cause for concern. But we are \n     not there yet in terms of the totality of fact on which to \n     draw such serious conclusions.\n       Today and tomorrow, our policy-makers must be able to rely \n     on the intelligence they are provided. The safety and \n     security of the men and women of the armed forces are \n     dependent on intelligence and, indeed, the security of our \n     Nation.\n       So collectively, all of us--the Congress, the executive \n     branch and other nations--we must vigorously continue to \n     pursue the collection of the facts, as the ISC is doing, and \n     upon that completion, then draw our conclusions and take such \n     corrective measures as may be necessary.\n       WARNER: As we speak, over 1,400 individuals--military and \n     civilian--are on the ground in Iraq seeking the facts about \n     Iraq's WMD programs. I have confidence in the commitment and \n     the ability of General Dayton, Mr. Duelfer, your successor, \n     and representatives from our coalition partners to complete \n     this mission. They have some of the best and brightest of our \n     military and our intelligence community to complete this \n     task. And Congress has provided the necessary means, a very \n     substantial appropriation of recent.\n       We remain committed to providing the resources that are \n     necessary for the completion of the ISG work.\n       Dr. Kay, I thank you for your public service once again.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/11/senate-section/article/S1011-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1011]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          BELARUSIAN AUTHORITIES CONTINUE TO STIFLE DEMOCRACY\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, as co-chairman of the Commission on \nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe, I want to update colleagues on \ndevelopments in the Republic of Belarus, a country with the poorest \nhuman rights record of any country in Europe today. In the last year, \nBelarusian dictator Lukashenka's assault on civil society has steadily \nintensified, with the liquidation of NGOs, violence against opposition \nactivists, and repression of the independent media and trade unions. \nThe situation in Belarus continues its downward spiral with daily \nreports of growing repression and new human rights violations.\n  Since the beginning of the still relatively new year, NGOs such as \nthe Belarusian Language Society and the Belarusian Helsinki Committee \nhave stepped up harassment. The Minsk City Court has ordered the \nliquidation of the Independent Association of Legal Research. Leaders \nof the opposition ``Five Plus'' bloc, who are in Washington this week, \nwere recently detained and searched by customs officials at the Polish-\nBelarusian border. The officials were reportedly looking for printed, \naudio or video materials that could ``damage the political and economic \ninterests of the country.'' Human rights activists or independent \njournalists such as Natalya Kolyada, Nina Davydowskaya, Iryna \nMakavetskaya, Aksana Novikava and Aleksandr Silitsky continue to be \nsubjected to threats, detentions or heavy fines. Others, including \nactivists of the youth group ZUBR, have been arrested for holding an \nunauthorized picket demanding a thorough investigation of the \ndisappearances of three democratic opposition members Yuri Zakharenka, \nVictor Gonchar, Anatoly Krasovsky, and journalist Dmitri Zavadsky.\n  Independent media outlets also continue to feel the wrath of the \npowers that be, including libel proceedings against Narodnaya Volya, \nBelarus' largest independent daily; the confiscation of Asambleya, a \nbulletin of the Assembly of the Belarusian Democratic NGOs; the refusal \nby the Belarusian Postal Service to distribute the independent \nnewspaper Regionalniye Novosti; the confiscation of copies, in the town \nof Smorgon, of the independent newspaper, Mestnaya Gazeta; and the \ncensoring of the independent newspaper Volnaya Hlybokaye in the Vitebsk \nregion. Several Jewish cemeteries are being destroyed, Baptist \ncongregations are being fined and Krishna followers detained.\n  In an unusual step, the International Labor Organization, ILO, has \nestablished a commission of inquiry--only the eleventh time in the \nbody's 84-year history--to examine violations of trade union rights in \nBelarus. Meanwhile, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of \nEurope's Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights unanimously \nratified a report on political disappearances in Belarus. The just-\nreleased report severely criticizes the Belarusian authorities, stating \nthat ``steps were taken at the highest level of the State actively to \ncover up the . . . disappearances'' of several high-profile members of \nthe opposition in 1999 to 2000 and that senior Belarusian officials may \nbe involved.\n  Last year I introduced the Belarus Democracy Act of 2003, S. 700, \nwhich is designed to help promote democratic development, human rights \nand rule of law in the Republic of Belarus, as well as encourage the \nconsolidation and strengthening of Belarus' sovereignty and \nindependence.\n  While some might be tempted to dismiss Belarus as an anomaly, the \nstakes are too high and the costs too great to ignore. It is important \nfor us to stay the course and support Belarus in becoming a genuine \nEuropean state, in which respect for human rights and democracy is the \nnorm and in which the long-suffering Belarusian people are able to \novercome the legacy of dictatorship--past and present. The Belarus \nDemocracy Act--which enjoys bipartisan support--is an important, \nconcrete way to exhibit our support. I urge colleagues to support this \nmeasure and look forward to timely consideration of the Belarus \nDemocracy Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/11/senate-section/article/S1011-2", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1011-S1012]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     AMERICAN HOSTAGES IN COLOMBIA\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, it has been almost a year since three \nAmericans--Marc Gonsalves, Keith Stansell, and Thomas Howes--were taken \nhostage by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, FARC. The \npresence of American hostages in Colombia is deeply troubling, and one \ncan only imagine the struggles and trials that these three brave \nindividuals have had to endure since their plane crashed in the \nColombian jungle last year on February 13. I rise today to again call \nattention to their plight and urge the Bush administration and \nColombian Government to do everything possible to gain their release.\n  There is no higher priority than finding a way to bring these three \nAmericans home safely, and I know that all of our prayers remain with \nthem and their families during these difficult times. For the families \nof Marc, Keith, and Tom, this past year has been a heart wrenching \nexperience. I have a special interest in the fate of Marc Gonsalves, \nwhose mother, Jo Rosano, is a Connecticut resident. Marc's father, \nGeorge Gonsavales, is also a resident of our State.\n  At every opportunity, I have worked to bring about the release of \nthese three Americans. Indeed, over the last\n\n[[Page S1012]]\n\n8 months whenever I have met with Colombian President Uribe or other \nColombian officials, I have urged them to make every effort to gain \ntheir release. President Uribe indicated to me that the Colombian \nmilitary continues every day to search for them and that these efforts \nwill not cease until they are found.\n  In addition, during a hearing last fall of the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee, I urged the now-serving United States Ambassador \nto Colombia, William Wood, to make their rescue his highest priority. \nHe pledged to do so and has kept me informed of developments in this \nmatter. I have also continually urged the Bush administration to \nprovide all means of assistance, including technological assistance, to \nbring about the safe rescue of Marc, Keith, and Tom. It is my \nunderstanding that the administration continues to work with Colombian \nauthorities to locate them.\n  Certainly, their rescue will not be easy. However, I have to believe \nthat more can be done. This must be the highest of priorities. The \nairing last year of the videotape showing them in captivity only \nfurther highlights the importance of this effort.\n  The families of Marc, Keith, and Tom will find no rest until their \nsons, husbands, fathers, and brothers return home safely. I will be \nmeeting with Jo Rosano tomorrow, when she, along with other family \nmembers of the hostages, come to Washington, DC on the anniversary of \nthis tragic incident to urge United States policymakers not to forget \ntheir family members in captivity.\n  And I will tell her what I have said here today: that we must make \nevery effort and we must leave no stone unturned in our search. As \nAmericans, Marc, Keith, and Tom are also our sons--they are members of \nour extended American family. For my part, I pledge to continue to do \neverything possible to ensure their speedy release and safe return. I \nurge the Bush administration and Colombian Government to do the same. \nWe must not rest until they are all home safely.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/11/senate-section/article/S1012-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1012]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  One such crime occurred in Honolulu, HI, in August 1998. A \nheterosexual man was found dead in a public shower. He had been \nbrutally killed by a group of teenagers because they thought he was \ngay.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/11/senate-section/article/S1012-2", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1012]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   CELEBRATING THE ``SEUSSENTENNIAL''\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, each year on March 2 thousands of \nschools and millions of children take part in Read Across America, the \nNational Education Association's annual celebration of reading and \nliteracy. The date is no accident: March 2 is the birthday of Theodor \nSeuss Geisel, better known as Dr. Seuss.\n  As much as anyone in the past century, Dr. Seuss helped children \nlearn to love reading by making it fun and exciting. In my frequent \nvisits to classrooms and afterschool programs, I often read to young \nchildren, and I have found that Dr. Seuss is their favorite author.\n  His books are read and treasured everywhere--particularly in \nCalifornia, where he spent most of his adult life. In 1948, he bought \nan old observation tower in La Jolla, CA. For the rest of his life, The \nTower was his residence and workshop. Every morning, Ted Geisel would \nwalk into his studio, lock the door, and become Dr. Seuss. Drawing on \nhis extensive collection of hats--inspired by ``The 500 Hats of \nBartholomew Cubbins''--Dr. Seuss would put on a ``thinking cap'' and \nget to work.\n  The books that came out of The Tower--including ``The Cat in the \nHat,'' ``Green Eggs and Ham,'' ``If I Ran the Zoo,'' ``Horton Hears a \nWho,'' ``And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street,'' ``How the \nGrinch Stole Christmas,'' and ``Oh, the Places You'll Go!''--are among \nthe best-known and best-loved classics of children's literature.\n  Dr. Seuss inspired Read Across America because he opened the door to \nliteracy for generations of children by engaging them with gentle humor \nand fantasy.\n  The 2004 Read Across America is extra-special because it is the \n``Seussentennial''--Dr. Seuss's 100th birthday. The celebration has \nalready begun in schools and community centers across America, where \nkids are making giant birthday cards, collecting hats, and, of course, \nreading lots of good books.\n  As we approach the ``Seussentennial,'' I invite children and grownups \neverywhere to celebrate the joy of reading by honoring a great American \nauthor and educator, Theodor Seuss Geisel.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/11/senate-section/article/S1012-3", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1012]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HONORING R.

His story should serve as an inspiration to us all as we \ntry to make our country a better place.\n  He was raised in California and attended the University of California \nat Santa Cruz. Upon graduation he was accepted for graduate school of \nthe prestigious University of California at Berkeley, yet he never had \nthe opportunity to complete his degree when his father became ill. \nWillis returned to be with his father in Bishop, CA, where he worked as \nthe Education Department director for the Owens Valley Paiute Tribes. \nThe experience set the tone for\n\n[[Page S1013]]\n\na long career in tribal and educational organizations.\n  Willis arrived to Roseburg, OR, in the early 1980s, continuing his \nwork at Umpqua Community College in the Student Services department, \nand later at Rogue Community College as a financial aid officer, \nhelping hundreds of young adults explore their career opportunities. \nAfter leaving his mark on the education arena, he decided to serve \nlocal American Indian tribes in their quest of cultural restoration and \neconomic self-sufficiency.\n  In 1982, Willis began working with the Confederated Tribes of Siletz \nIndians, ultimately becoming general manager of the Confederated Tribes \nof Grand Ronde. His long and distinguished career in Oregon tribal \ngovernment was illustrious and renowned throughout the State. He is \nwell respected in tribal and State government circles. Willis was \nappointed to the Oregon State Board of Higher Education in 1993, where \nhe served an important role until he stepped down in 2001. He was \npivotal in the rise in prominence of our State Universities.\n  Currently, Willis is winning a hard-fought battle with cancer. I join \nwith countless others in honoring his courage as he fights to overcome \nthis devastating disease. We all look forward to the day that Jim \nWillis returns to help improve our great State of Oregon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/11/senate-section/article/S1013-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1013-S1014]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       IN MEMORY OF SCOTT HOFFMAN\n\n Mr. BEN NELSON. Mr. President, today I would like to share \nwith my colleagues and the nation a tribute to a friend of mine from \nNebraska.\n  On Sunday, February 8, 2004, Scott Hoffman of McCook, NE, passed \naway. His family lost a loving husband and father. I lost a friend and \ntrusted member of my staff. And the State of Nebraska lost a proud \nnative son and someone who embodied the attributes often used to \ndescribe our State--strong, hard working, caring and deeply invested in \nhis community.\n  We are deeply saddened by the tragic loss of our coworker and friend. \nOur thoughts and prayers are with Scott's wife Darcey, their sons \nChristian and Stephen, his daughter Danae, and the entire Hoffman \nfamily.\n  Scott was a devoted family man, a dedicated public servant and a true \nfriend. Scott seemed to always have his finger on the pulse of \nSouthwest Nebraska. There isn't a community or a cause that isn't \nfamiliar with Scott's work advocating for the entire region.\n  Back when I was considering running in the 2000 Senate elections, I \nvisited the local paper, the McCook Gazette, for an editorial board \nmeeting. Scott was a member of the newspaper staff at the time. After \nthe meeting he walked me out to the car and asked if he could join my \ncampaign staff. We hired him and that was one of the best decisions I \nmade.\n  Scott had a knack for working with people. He could as easily \ncommunicate with members of the press or a chamber of commerce as with \nelementary school students. He would walk into a room and be able to \nget disparate people to work together--a talent few have and fewer \nstill can master. This ability made him an asset, not just to my \noffice--and I am grateful he was a member of my team--but to the entire \nState of Nebraska. Scott always knew our primary concern is the welfare \nof Nebraska and he spent his time working on behalf of Nebraska's \ninterests.\n  Scott's work on behalf of Nebraska was well respected and only \nrecently did I learn that community officials sought out Scott to lead \nthe McCook Economic Development Corporation. Scott, in his typical \nfashion, told the leaders that he was doing what he wanted to do and \nwasn't seeking a change. That loyalty was a defining characteristic of \nScott Hoffman and he applied it to his job, his church, his family, his \nfriends and his community.\n  His legacy can be measured in the outpouring of support his family \nhas received in recent days. The community of McCook was there for \nScott in the hours after he was reported missing. Over two hundred \nvolunteers, including members of McCook Senior High's football and \ntrack teams, joined more than thirty first responders in the search for \nScott. Although that search ultimately came to a tragic end, the \ndedication of these rescuers underscores Scott's connection to his \ncommunity.\n  And the community of McCook was there again for Scott's family when \nnews spread that he had passed. The letters, phone calls and testaments \nto Scott have poured in from Nebraskans across the State and as far \naway as Africa. It is overwhelming, but comforting, because we know \nthat although Scott is gone, he will not be forgotten. In his 33 years, \nhe has left his mark in McCook and his friends and neighbors will \nensure that his memory lives on.\n  Scott was a good friend to many in the McCook area and across \nNebraska, including me, Diane and everyone on my staff. He will be \nmissed and remembered fondly by all who knew him, especially those of \nus who had the pleasure of working with him. Personally, I am going to \nmiss his advice, his hard work on behalf of Nebraska, and most of all, \nthe friendship I was so fortunate to share with him. He will be deeply \nmissed by all of us.\n  A friend of Scott's at the McCook Gazette wrote this week of Scott \nthat he ``spent his time well.'' His activities on his last day with us \nbear that out. He took his sons Christian and Stephen sledding. He went \ngrocery shopping for his family. He took his beloved dogs for a walk. \nIn some ways it seems that he was called from this life at a moment of \ngreat peace, having fulfilled his duties to protect and provide for his \nfamily. His loss leaves us with unanswered questions but also fills us \nwith the satisfaction of knowing Scott loved us, and was loved in \nreturn. And that is what makes life fulfilling.\n  I ask that two articles in tribute to Scott from his hometown paper \nthe McCook Gazette be printed in their entirety in the Record.\n  The documents follow:\n\n             [From the McCook Daily Gazette, Feb. 10, 2004]\n\n                Monday Brings Worst Fears, Best Memories\n\n       While the example of his life burns brightly in our minds, \n     we need to find fitting ways to pay tribute to the memory of \n     Scott Hoffman.\n       In some form--either through a monument, an award, a \n     scholarship or another appropriate means--we need to come up \n     with a lasting memorial to eulogize Scott and to create an \n     inspiration for generations to come.\n       Because, in his 33 years of life, this dynamic young man \n     showed us the importance of getting involved, staying \n     involved and remaining faithful to your family, your church, \n     your job and your community.\n       Scott Hoffman did all that . . . and much more. As you have \n     already heard on radio and television and read on the front \n     page of the newspaper, the search for Scott ended tragically \n     Monday afternoon when his body was found by a diver in the \n     Huck Finn Pond at Barnett Park.\n       With the discovery our worst fears were realized. While we \n     mourn, we also give praise for the life Scott lived.\n       To give illustrations of how highly he was held in esteem, \n     we offer two recent examples. First, following a recent \n     speech which Scott gave on Sen. Ben Nelson's behalf, a member \n     of the news media addressed Scott, ``You are very well spoken \n     and very focused on the issues. Would you consider running \n     for office yourself?'' Then, late in 2003, Scott was asked, \n     privately, to consider entering his name in application for \n     the director's position with the McCook Economic Development \n     Corp.\n       In both cases, politely and humbly, Scott declined. ``I'm \n     where I want to be and I am doing what I want to do,'' is the \n     best way to summarize his answers. He appreciated the \n     opportunities, but remained dedicated, devoted and satisfied \n     with the course his life was taking.\n       We don't find that kind of steadfast loyalty nearly enough \n     in these times. You could see the love and respect for Scott \n     shine through Monday evening in radio and television \n     interviews with his good friend, Kerry Ferguson; the Gazette \n     editor, Bruce Crosby; and Red Willow County Sheriff, Gene \n     Mahon.\n       They were more than Scott's co-workers and officials with \n     whom he worked. They were Scott's friends, as were so many \n     others in this region, this State, and--increasingly through \n     his work with Sen. Nelson--this Nation.\n       It is both important and appropriate that we remember Scott \n     Hoffman. He served us and shared with us during his 33 years \n     of life. In times to come, we need to cherish his memory and \n     be uplifted by his example through a lasting memorial.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             [From the McCook Daily Gazette, Feb. 10, 2004]\n\n                     A Guy Who Spent His Time Well\n\n                           (By Bruce Crosby)\n\n       Scott Hoffman took his two sons, Christian, 9, and Stephen, \n     6, sledding Sunday afternoon.\n       He went to the grocery store for his wife, Darcey, and \n     carried the food into the kitchen.\n\n[[Page S1014]]\n\n       ``I guest I'll take the dogs for a run,'' he said, heading \n     out the door with their three pets.\n       I've written before about my late stepmother, Alyce, who \n     always said, ``I'd rather wear out, than rust out.''\n       She lived by that saying, spending her time caring for her \n     family--offering advice to her often bewildered stepson--\n     volunteering for her church and community, almost to the end, \n     at the of 83.\n       I wish Scott would have had the same chance. As it was, he \n     spent his last Sunday the way he spent most of his spare \n     time--taking care of those he loved.\n       Scott deserved another 50 years, at least as much as any of \n     us do. He was just hitting his stride when he was called from \n     this life Sunday afternoon, at the age of 33.\n       Maybe his memory will help us make the right choices when \n     it comes to how we spend our precious days on earth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/11/senate-section/article/S1014-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1014]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/11/senate-section/article/S1014-2", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1014]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/11/senate-section/article/S1014-3", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1014]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 1:23 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \nagreed to the following concurrent resolutions, in which it requests \nthe concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.

A bill to authorize appropriations to the Secretary of \nCommerce for the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management \nAct for fiscal years 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2008, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Fishery \nConservation and Management Act Amendments of 2004. This bill would \nreauthorize the Magnuson-Stevens Fisheries Conservation and Management \nAct, as amended by the 1996 Sustainable Fisheries Act, and update \nfisheries policy to better satisfy the ever-changing needs of our \nNation's fish stocks and fishing communities.\n  In 1976, the year in which the Magnuson-Stevens Act was written, our \ncommercial fisheries were in grave danger of being exploited beyond \ntheir ability to recover. Passage of the Act has provided a more \nbalanced approach in fulfilling our economic needs by also promoting \nresponsible conservation and stewardship of our resources. Even as it \nsought to provide better management for the Nation's resources as a \nwhole, this law recognized that our fisheries have vastly different \nregional problems. The result was the creation of a regional management \ncouncil in each of the country's eight major marine fisheries. These \ncouncils, with substantial input from the local community, are \nresponsible for creating the management plans by which their fish \nstocks are regulated by the National Marine Fisheries Services. This \nstructure has been vital in allowing the active stakeholders in each \nregion to provide meaningful input to the management process.\n  Since the enactment of this legislation, domestic offshore catches \nhave increased so dramatically that our fisheries now add billions of \ndollars to the Nation's economy every year, according to the National \nMarine Fisheries Service. Because of this increase in fishing harvests \nand the pressure to fish more than could be sustained, in 1996 Congress \npassed the Sustainable Fisheries Act to amend and enhance the Magnuson-\nStevens Act. The new amendments included new guidelines for \nconservation of both targeted fisheries and bycatch, or incidentally-\ncaught fish and other marine life. The Act required that overfished \nstocks be rebuilt within a 10 year timeframe. In addition, the \nprovisions added a requirement for the protection of all essential fish \nhabitat for each fishery.\n  The overarching goal of the Sustainable Fisheries Act was to ensure \nprosperity for all United States fisheries by ending overfishing and \nrebuilding depleted stocks. This goal, and the means for achieving it, \nare as important today as they were in 1996. I supported the Act, \nbecause I saw in it great potential for sustaining fishing communities \nand the stocks upon which they depend.\n  In the nearly 8 years since we last renewed and reauthorized the \nMagnuson-Stevens Act, however, we have witnessed both prosperity and \ndegradation in different fisheries affected by this law. According to \nthe National Marine Fisheries Service's Annual Report in 2003, certain \nfisheries have thrived; for example, sea scallops on Georges Bank have \nincreased 20-fold from 1994 to 2002, silver hake in the Northeast was \ndeclared fully rebuilt in 2002, and recovery of dozens of other stocks \nis well underway. The National Marine Fisheries Services' most recent \nsurvey of young Georges Bank haddock indicates a population boom with \nthe potential to be the largest ever recorded, putting that fishery \nwell on the road to its recovery goal. Conversely, other fisheries have \nnot fared as well, as demonstrated by the fact that overfishing \ncommenced in 13 U.S. fisheries between 1997 and 2002.\n\n  As Chair of the Oceans, Fisheries, and Coast Guard Subcommittee of \nthe Commerce Committee, I have sought answers as to why the Magnuson-\nStevens Act has apparently worked well for some fisheries, but not \nothers. Representing a state with scores of fishing communities and \nthousands of fisheries workers, I understand the great importance of \nmaking sure that our federal fisheries laws are working for all of our \nNation's fisheries.\n  In seeking these answers, during the 106th Congress I traveled across \nthe country and held a series of hearings on the Magnuson-Stevens Act. \nIn Washington, D.C. Maine, Louisiana, Alaska, Washington, and \nMassachusetts, I heard official testimony from over 70 witnesses. Our \nsubcommittee received hundreds of comments, views, and recommendations \nfrom federal and state officials, regional council chairmen and \nmembers, other fisheries managers, commercial and recreational \nfishermen, members of the conservation community, and many others \ninterested in fisheries management.\n  What the subcommittee learned during these hearing--and which \ncontinues to be reinforced by more recent fisheries events, comments, \nand recommendations--is that most of the shortcomings in our federal \nfisheries policy are products of how the Magnuson-Stevens Act has been \ninterpreted and applied to real-life fisheries problems. While the \nunderpinnings of the Act are sound, it has become clear that \nimplementation of the Act has often been inconsistent with \nCongressional intent. That is the primary challenge before us today: to \nclarify how the goals of conservation and management can be achieved \nfor our Nation's fisheries, and ensure effective implementation of the \nAct.\n  What we need is a federal fisheries policy that can be interpreted \nand applied in ways that recognize and respond to the unique conditions \nfacing each individual fishery. Of the hundreds of fisheries occurring \naround our Nation's coastline, no two are exactly alike. The \nconservation measures that work in one fishery cannot always be \ntransferred to another. The Magnuson-Stevens act must express enough \nflexibility to accommodate these variations, so that managers can craft \nunique, innovative solutions based on the conditions and needs of the \nfish stocks and fishing communities in question.\n  I first attempted to address these issues when I introduced S. 2832, \nthe Magnuson-Stevens Reauthorization Act of 2000, as well as bills \nauthorizing national standards for fishing quota systems. During the \nlast several years, the need for these amendments--as well as new \namendments to meet evolving fisheries needs--has only intensified. It \nis this fact that underlies the bill I introduce today, the Fishery \nConservation and Management Act Amendments of 2004.\n  This bill contains several specific measures for enhancing management \nflexibility. First and foremost, this bill would repeal the 10-year \ntimeline for rebuilding fish stocks and the unnecessarily-rigid \nmeasures that stem from it. This provision of the Sustainable Fisheries \nAct is not based on fish population dynamics, but instead imposes a \nstringent and arbitrary time-frame inappropriate for the diverse needs \nof each individual fishery. This bill would replace it with a system \nthat allows a more adaptive approach for determining harvest rates. I \nam proposing that fishing mortality rates simply be limited to the \nmaximum sustainable yield that a stock can produce in any given year. \nThis fishing rate would not permit overfishing; it would allow stocks \nto rebuild over time to a level that achieves ecosystem balance.\n  Another new proposal in this bill would improve managers' ability to \nfairly distribute access to distant-water fish stocks. As is now \noccurring in the New England groundfishery, fishermen from different \nstates are unevenly impacted by management measures that treat them as \nif they are all from the same state. Currently, fishermen who live \nfarther away from healthy fish stocks need to expend their extremely \nlimited number of permitted days-at-sea simply steaming to and from \nthese stocks, while those who live closer to the stocks can spend more \nof their days-at-sea actually fishing. I am proposing that regional \nfishery management councils analyze these impacts and, if necessary, \ntake action to eliminate such inequities.\n  Other key features of this Magnuson-Stevens Act reauthorization would \naddress essential fish habitat and areas of particular concern; \nauthorizations for cooperative research, capacity reduction, and \nfishing quota systems; and\n\n[[Page S1019]]\n\nlanguage to improve social and ecological impact assessments, data and \ninformation management, public meeting notices, and scientific peer \nreviews. Individually and collectively, the provisions in this bill \npresent a way forward in improving federal fisheries management. This \nbill preserves the goal and intent of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, yet it \nenhances the abilities of managers and fishermen to apply it in a way \nthat can better achieve the Act's objectives and actually achieve \nsustainability in our fisheries.\n  Finally, I would like to thank all those fishermen, managers, \nscientists, and special interest groups that contributed ideas and \ninformation to the long process of developing this reauthorization \nbill. Their countless contributions serve as invaluable pieces to a \nvery complex puzzle, and I am confident that our efforts will improve \nthe state of federal fisheries management.\n  I look forward to receiving additional fisheries policy comments and \nrecommendations in the weeks and months ahead, including those from the \nU.S. Commission on Ocean Policy, and I encourage my colleagues \nthroughout Congress to take action in support of this Magnuson-Stevens \nreauthorization effort. Through our collective efforts, sustainable \nfisheries in the United States can and will become a reality.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER (for herself and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 2067. A bill to withdraw the Los Padres National Forest in \nCalifornia from location, entry, and patent under mining laws, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today that \nwould ban oil and gas drilling in the Los Padres National Forest. \nCongresswoman Capps is introducing this legislation in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  Despite strong local opposition to drilling in the forest, the Forest \nService released a Draft Environmental Impact Statement in October 2001 \nthat recommended opening up additional lands in the forest to oil and \ngas exploration. By failing to consider the irreparable harm these \nactivities would cause to the forest's resources and the recreational \nopportunities available to both nearby residents and tourists, the \nForest Service's proposal is shortsighted and misguided.\n  The opening of the spectacular, unspoiled lands in Los Padres \nNational Forest to oil and gas drilling threatens one of California's \nmost pristine places. Los Padres National Forest provides habitat for \nvarious threatened and endangered wildlife species, including the \nendangered California condor. Also within the Los Padres National \nForest are unexplored archeological sites that contain Native American \nhistorical artifacts. These could be damaged or destroyed by oil and \ngas development.\n  Los Padres National Forest provides a variety of recreational \nopportunities, such as fishing, hiking, hunting, and backpacking. These \nactivities would be hindered by new oil and gas exploration and \ndevelopment, as streams and trails are contaminated by runoff and \nsedimentation and as air pollution is increased.\n  This legislation is a critical step toward protecting the \nirreplaceable natural and cultural resources of the Los Padres National \nForest. I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/11/senate-section/article/S1019-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1019-S1020]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 298--DESIGNATING MAY 2004 AS ``NATIONAL CYSTIC \n                       FIBROSIS AWARENESS MONTH''\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL (for himself, Ms. Murkowski, Mrs. Lincoln, Mrs. Murray, \nMs. Landrieu, Mr. Biden, Mr. Bunning, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Johnson, and Mr. \nFitzgerald) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 298\n\n       Whereas cystic fibrosis, characterized by chronic lung \n     infections and digestive disorders, is a fatal lung disease;\n       Whereas cystic fibrosis is 1 of the most common genetic \n     diseases in the United States and 1 for which there is no \n     known cure;\n       Whereas more than 10,000,000 Americans are unknowing \n     carriers of the cystic fibrosis gene;\n       Whereas 1 of every 3,500 babies born in the United States \n     is born with cystic fibrosis;\n       Whereas newborn screening for cystic fibrosis has been \n     implemented by 11 States and facilitates early diagnosis and \n     treatment which improves health and longevity;\n       Whereas approximately 30,000 people in the United States \n     have cystic fibrosis, many of them children;\n       Whereas the average life expectancy of an individual with \n     cystic fibrosis is in the early thirties, an improvement from \n     a life expectancy of 10 years in the 1960s, but still \n     unacceptably short;\n       Whereas prompt, aggressive treatment of the symptoms of \n     cystic fibrosis can extend the lives of people who have the \n     disease;\n       Whereas recent advances in cystic fibrosis research have \n     produced promising leads in gene, protein, and drug therapies \n     beneficial to people who have the disease;\n       Whereas this innovative research is progressing faster and \n     is being conducted more aggressively than ever before, due in \n     part to the establishment of a model clinical trials network \n     by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation; and\n       Whereas education of the public on cystic fibrosis, \n     including the symptoms of the disease, increases knowledge \n     and understanding of cystic fibrosis and promotes early \n     diagnosis: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates May 2004 as ``National Cystic Fibrosis \n     Awareness Month'';\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation--\n       (A) designating the month of May 2004 as ``National Cystic \n     Fibrosis Awareness Month''; and\n       (B) calling on the people of the United States to promote \n     awareness of cystic fibrosis and actively participate in \n     support of research to control or cure cystic fibrosis, by \n     observing the month with appropriate ceremonies and \n     activities; and\n       (3) supports the goals of--\n       (A) increasing the quality of life for individuals with \n     cystic fibrosis by promoting public knowledge and \n     understanding in a manner that will result in earlier \n     diagnoses;\n       (B) encouraging increased resources for research; and\n       (C) increasing levels of support for people who have cystic \n     fibrosis and their families.\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am submitting a resolution \nrecognizing the month of May, 2004, as National Cystic Fibrosis \nAwareness Month. I am pleased to be joined by nine of my colleagues who \nare original cosponsors of the resolution. We are hopeful that greater \nawareness of cystic fibrosis (CF) will lead to a cure.\n  The resolution is similar to one which I submitted last year, S. Res. \n98, declaring a National Cystic Fibrosis Awareness Week, which was \nagreed to by unanimous consent on September 25, 2003. Since then, I \nhave received input from the National Cystic Fibrosis Foundation ( CFF) \nand the National Cystic Fibrosis Awareness Committee and have updated \nthe information accordingly.\n  Cystic fibrosis is one of the most common fatal genetic diseases in \nthe United States and there is no known cure. It affects approximately \n30,000 children and adults in the United States. As recently as 25 \nyears ago, most children born with cystic fibrosis died in early \nchildhood and few survived to their teenage years.\n  Today, the average life expectancy of an individual with cystic \nfibrosis is in the early thirties, an improvement from a life \nexpectancy of 10 years in the 1960s, but still unacceptably short. The \ndifference stems from productive research which has led to an \nunderstanding of the way cystic fibrosis causes life-threatening damage \nand to the development of preventive techniques and treatments.\n  While there is no cure, early detection and prompt treatment can \nsignificantly improve and extend the lives of those with CF. My home \nstate of Colorado was one of the first States to require CF screening \nfor newborns. Happily, many more States are now performing this simple \ntest.\n  And, since the discovery of the defective CF gene in 1989, CF \nresearch has greatly accelerated. I am proud that Colorado is home to \nthe University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, including the \nChildren's Hospital, the National Jewish Medical and Research Center \nand the Anschutz Centers for Advanced Medicine, all of which are \nactively involved in CF research and care. The Children's Hospital is \none of a number of innovative Therapeutics Development Centers \nnationwide performing cutting edge clinical research to develop new \ntreatments for CF.\n  Currently, the CF Foundation oversees potential CF products in its \ndrug development pipeline, including those\n\n[[Page S1020]]\n\nin clinical trials. In addition, small pilot trials and large clinical \nstudies are carried out in the CF Foundation-accredited care centers \nacross the United States. Organizations such as the Cystic Fibrosis \nResearch, Inc. also sponsor studies for treatment of the disease. \nEfforts such as these throughout the nation are providing a greater \nquality of life for those who have CF. We applaud these efforts.\n  While I am encouraged by the CF research in Colorado and elsewhere, \nmore needs to be done. I believe we can increase the quality of life \nfor individuals with Cystic Fibrosis by promoting public knowledge and \nunderstanding of the disease in a manner that will result in earlier \ndiagnoses, more fund raising efforts for research, and increased levels \nof support for those who have CF and their families.\n  Therefore, I urge my colleagues to act on this resolution so we can \nmove another step closer to eradicating this disease.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/11/senate-section/article/S1020-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1020]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 299--RECOGNIZING, AND SUPPORTING EFFORTS TO ENHANCE \n THE PUBLIC AWARENESS OF, THE SOCIAL PROBLEM OF CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL (for himself, Mr. Specter, Mr. DeWine, Ms. Murkowski, \nMr. Akaka, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Allen, and Mr. Dorgan) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the \nJudiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 299\n\n       Whereas each year in the United States approximately \n     3,000,000 reports of suspected or known child abuse and \n     neglect, involving 5,000,000 children, are made to child \n     protective service agencies;\n       Whereas 588,000 children are unable to live safely with \n     their families and are placed in foster homes and \n     institutions;\n       Whereas it is estimated that every year in the United \n     States more than 1,200 children, 85 percent of whom are under \n     the age of 6 years, of whom 44 percent are under the age of 1 \n     year, lose their lives as a direct result of abuse and \n     neglect;\n       Whereas this tragic social problem results in human and \n     economic costs through crime and delinquency, drug and \n     alcohol abuse, domestic violence, and welfare dependency; and\n       Whereas Childhelp USA has initiated a Day of Hope to be \n     observed on Wednesday, April 7, 2004, during Child Abuse \n     Prevention Month, to focus public awareness on child abuse \n     and neglect: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (A) all Americans should keep the victims of child abuse \n     and neglect in their thoughts and prayers;\n       (B) all Americans should seek to break the cycle of child \n     abuse and neglect and to give victimized children hope for \n     the future; and\n       (C) the faith community, nonprofit organizations, and \n     volunteers across America should recommit themselves and \n     mobilize their resources to assist abused and neglected \n     children; and\n       (2) the Senate--\n       (A) supports the goals and ideas of the Day of Hope, which \n     will be observed on April 7, 2004, as part of Child Abuse \n     Prevention Month; and\n       (B) commends the individuals working on behalf of abused \n     and neglected children throughout the United States.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am submitting a resolution \ndeclaring Wednesday, April 7, 2004, as a National Day of Hope dedicated \nto remembering the victims of child abuse and neglect and recognizing \nChildhelp USA for initiating such a day. I am pleased to be joined in \nthis effort by my colleagues Senators Specter, DeWine, Murkowski, \nInhofe, Allen, Dorgan, and Akaka who are original cosponsors of the \nresolution.\n  This resolution is similar to one I submitted last year, S. Res. 52, \nwhich passed the Senate by unanimous consent on March 26, 2004. It \nexpresses the sense of Congress that we must break the cycle of child \nabuse and neglect by mobilizing all our resources including the faith \ncommunity, non-profit organizations and volunteers.\n  The resolution also recognizes Childhelp USA, one of our oldest \nnational organizations dedicated to meeting the needs of abused and \nneglected children. Childhelp and many other non-profits or faith-based \norganizations nationwide are performing a vital service to these \nchildren that they would not have otherwise, and they are to be \ncommended for their efforts.\n  More than 3 million children are reported as suspected victims of \nchild abuse and neglect each year. That is 3 million children too many. \nAnd, it is estimated that more than 1,200 children lose their lives as \na direct result of abuse and neglect every year. That is not \nacceptable. We must do something to change these disturbing statistics.\n  I know first-hand the importance of having help when it is needed. \nThe National Day of Hope Resolution calls on each of us to renew our \nduty and responsibility to the vulnerable children and families caught \nin the cycle of child abuse and neglect.\n  While we are encouraged by the efforts of many organizations \nnationwide, more needs to be done. That is why we urge our colleagues \nto act quickly on this resolution so we can move another step closer to \nerasing the horror of child abuse from our nation's history.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/11/senate-section/article/S1020-2", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1020]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 300--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE ON PROJECT \n               EARMARKING IN SURFACE TRANSPORTATION ACTS\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida (for himself and Mr. McCain) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works:\n\n                              S.

Findings, purpose, and goals\n\n       ``(a) Findings.--\n       ``(1) It is in the public interest of the United States to \n     encourage and promote the development of various modes of \n     transportation and transportation infrastructure to \n     efficiently maximize the mobility of passengers and goods.\n       ``(2) Despite Federal subsidies of nearly $27 billion over \n     the past 34 years, intercity rail passenger service still \n     accounts for less than 1 percent of all intercity travel.\n       ``(3) Intercity rail passenger service can be competitive \n     with other modes of transportation and achieve a significant \n     share of the travel market in short-distance corridors \n     connecting metropolitan areas.\n       ``(4) Rail passenger transportation can help alleviate \n     overcrowding of airways and airports, and can provide needed \n     intermodal connections to airports, bus terminals, and mass \n     transit services.\n       ``(5) Short-distance corridor trains account for \n     approximately 85 percent of Amtrak's ridership but only one-\n     third of Amtrak's operating losses, excluding depreciation.\n       ``(6) A number of Amtrak's long-distance routes may be more \n     efficiently operated and attract higher ridership as \n     connected corridors.\n       ``(7) Service over long-distance routes that cannot be \n     restructured as connected corridors, do not receive State \n     financial support, or are not an essential link to the rest \n     of the intercity passenger rail network, should be \n     consolidated or discontinued.\n       ``(8) Some States with short-distance corridor services \n     provide significant financial support for such services, \n     while other States with short-distance routes and all states \n     with long-distance routes contribute nothing for such \n     services. More equitable cost-sharing is needed to justify \n     Federal investment in intercity rail passenger service.\n       ``(9) The need to invest taxpayer dollars in intercity rail \n     passenger service demands that fair and open competition be \n     permitted for the provision of such services to ensure that \n     service is provided in the most efficient manner, without \n     jeopardizing the safety of such operations.\n       ``(10) A greater degree of cooperation is necessary among \n     intercity passenger service operators, freight railroads, \n     State, regional, and local governments, the private sector, \n     labor organizations, and suppliers of services and equipment \n     to achieve the performance sufficient to justify the \n     expenditure of additional public money on intercity rail \n     passenger service.\n       ``(11) Transportation services provided by the private \n     freight railroads are vital to the economy and national \n     defense and should not be disadvantaged by the operation of \n     intercity passenger rail service over their rights-of-way.\n       ``(12) The Northeast Corridor is a valuable resource of the \n     United States used by intercity and commuter rail passenger \n     transportation and freight transportation and should be \n     restored to a state of good repair.\n       ``(b) Purpose.--The purpose of this chapter is to assist in \n     the preservation and development of conventional and high-\n     speed intercity rail passenger services where such services \n     can play an important role in facilitating passenger mobility \n     in the United States.\n       ``(e) Goals.--The goals of this chapter are--\n       ``(1) to move toward a national network of interconnected \n     short-distance passenger rail corridor services,\n       ``(2) to return the Northeast Corridor to a state of good \n     repair;\n       ``(3) to establish a framework for the development of new \n     conventional and high-speed rail services;\n       ``(4) to allow for train services to be operated under \n     contract to a State or group of States, with the operator of \n     the service selected by the State or group of States;\n       ``(5) to establish equitable cost-sharing for capital \n     expenses and operating losses with the States; and\n       ``(6) to encourage greater participation in the provision \n     of intercity rail passenger services by the private \n     sector.''.\n\n     SEC. 612.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Our Nation's highways, public transportation systems, \n     and rail systems drive our economy, enabling all industries \n     to achieve growth and productivity that makes America strong \n     and prosperous.\n       (2) The establishment, maintenance, and improvement of the \n     national transportation network is a national priority, for \n     economic, environmental, energy, security, and other reasons.\n       (3) The ability to move people and goods is critical to \n     maintaining State, metropolitan, rural, and local economies.\n       (4) The construction of infrastructure requires the skills \n     of numerous occupations, including those in the contracting, \n     engineering, planning and design, materials supply, \n     manufacturing, distribution, and safety industries.\n       (5) Investing in transportation infrastructure creates \n     long-term capital assets for the Nation that will help the \n     United States address its enormous infrastructure needs and \n     improve its economic productivity.\n       (6) Investment in transportation infrastructure creates \n     jobs and spurs economic activity to put people back to work \n     and stimulate the economy.\n       (7) Every billion dollars in transportation investment has \n     the potential to create up to 47,500 jobs.\n       (8) Every dollar invested in the Nation's transportation \n     infrastructure yields at least $5.70 in economic benefits \n     because of reduced delays, improved safety, and reduced \n     vehicle operating costs.\n       (9) The proposed increases to the Transportation Equity Act \n     for the 21st Century (TEA-21) will not be sufficient to \n     compensate for the Nation's transportation infrastructure \n     deficit.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this subtitle is to provide \n     financing for long-term infrastructure capital investments \n     that are not currently being met by existing transportation \n     and infrastructure investment programs, including mega-\n     projects, projects of national significance and high priority \n     projects, multi-State transportation corridors, intermodal \n     transportation facilities, replacement and reconstruction of \n     deficient and obsolete bridges, interstate highways, public \n     transportation systems, and rail systems.\n\n     SEC. 5673.

COMMERCIAL TRUCK HIGHWAY SAFETY DEMONSTRATION \n                   PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the \n     ``Commercial Truck Highway Safety Demonstration Program Act \n     of 2004''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Public safety on the highways of the United States is a \n     paramount concern of all who use the highways and all who \n     prescribe public policy for the use of those highways, \n     including public policy on the operation of heavy commercial \n     trucks on highways.\n       (2) Federal highway funding law effectively imposes a limit \n     of 80,000 pounds on the weight of vehicles permitted to use \n     Interstate System highways.\n       (3) The administration of this law in Maine has forced \n     heavy tractor-trailer and tractor-semitrailer combination \n     vehicles traveling into Maine from neighboring States and \n     Canada to divert onto small State and local roads where \n     higher vehicle weight limits apply under Maine law.\n       (4) The diversion of those vehicles onto such roads causes \n     significant economic hardships and safety challenges for \n     small communities located along those roads.\n       (5) Permitting heavy commercial vehicles, including tanker \n     trucks carrying hazardous material and fuel oil, to travel on \n     Interstate System highways in Maine--\n       (A) would enhance public safety by reducing--\n       (i) the number of heavy vehicles that use town and city \n     streets in Maine; and\n       (ii) as a result, the number of dangerous interactions \n     between those heavy vehicles and such other vehicles as \n     school buses and private vehicles; and\n       (B) would reduce the net highway maintenance costs in Maine \n     because the Interstate System highways, unlike the secondary \n     roads of Maine, are built to accommodate heavy vehicles and \n     are, therefore, more durable.\n       (c) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Covered interstate system highway.--\n       (A) In general.--The term ``covered Interstate System \n     highway'' means a highway within the State of Maine that is \n     designated as a route on the Interstate System, except as \n     provided in subparagraph (B).\n       (B) Exception.--The term does not include any portion of \n     highway that, as of the date of the enactment of this \n     section, is exempted from the requirements of subsection (a) \n     of section 127 of title 23, United States Code, by the last \n     sentence of such subsection.\n       (2) Interstate system.--The term ``Interstate System'' has \n     the meaning given that term in section 101(a) of title 23, \n     United States Code.\n\n[[Page S1092]]\n\n       (d) Maine Truck Safety Demonstration Program.--The \n     Secretary of Transportation shall carry out a program, in the \n     administration of this section, to demonstrate the effects on \n     the safety of the overall highway network in the State of \n     Maine that would result from permitting vehicles described in \n     subsection (e)(2) to be operated on the Interstate System \n     highways within the State.\n       (e) Waiver of Highway Funding Reduction Relating to Weight \n     of Vehicles Using Interstate System Highways.--\n       (1) Prohibition relating to certain vehicles.--\n     Notwithstanding section 127(a) of title 23, United States \n     Code, the total amount of funds apportioned to the State of \n     Maine under section 104(b)(1) of such title for any period \n     may not be reduced under such section 127(a) on the basis \n     that the State of Maine permits a vehicle described in \n     paragraph (2) to use a covered Interstate System highway.\n       (2) Combination vehicles in excess of 80,000 pounds.--A \n     vehicle referred to in paragraph (1) is a vehicle having a \n     weight in excess of 80,000 pounds that--\n       (A) consists of a 3-axle tractor unit hauling a single \n     trailer or semitrailer; and\n       (B) does not exceed any vehicle weight limitation that is \n     applicable under the laws of the State of Maine to the \n     operation of such vehicle on highways in Maine not in the \n     Interstate System, as such laws are in effect on the date of \n     the enactment of this section.\n       (3) Effective date and termination.--\n       (A) Effective date.--\n       (i) Date of satisfaction of administrative conditions by \n     maine.--The prohibition in paragraph (1) shall take effect on \n     the date on which the Secretary of Transportation notifies \n     the Commissioner of Transportation of the State of Maine in \n     writing that--\n\n       (I) the Secretary has received the plan described in \n     subsection (f)(1);

or\n       (II) the Commissioner of Transportation of the State of \n     Maine has failed faithfully to use the highway safety \n     committee as described in subsection (f)(2)(A) or to collect \n     data as described in subsection (f)(3); and\n\n       (ii) publishes the determination, together with the date of \n     the termination of the prohibition, in the Federal Register.\n       (4) Consultation regarding termination for safety.--In \n     making a determination under paragraph (3)(B)(i)(I), the \n     Secretary of Transportation shall consult with the highway \n     safety committee established by the Commissioner in \n     accordance with subsection (f).\n       (f) Responsibilities of the State of Maine.--For the \n     purposes of subsection (e), the State of Maine satisfies the \n     conditions of this subsection if the Commissioner of \n     Transportation of the State of Maine--\n       (1) submits to the Secretary of Transportation a plan for \n     satisfying the conditions set forth in paragraphs (2) and \n     (3);\n       (2) establishes and chairs a highway safety committee \n     that--\n       (A) the Commissioner uses to review the data collected \n     pursuant to paragraph (3); and\n       (B) consists of representatives of--\n       (i) agencies of the State of Maine that have \n     responsibilities related to highway safety;\n       (ii) municipalities of the State of Maine;\n       (iii) organizations that have evaluation or promotion of \n     highway safety among their principal purposes;

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Our Nation's highways, public transportation systems, \n     and rail systems drive our economy, enabling all industries \n     to achieve growth and productivity that makes America strong \n     and prosperous.\n       (2) The establishment, maintenance, and improvement of the \n     national transportation network is a national priority, for \n     economic, environmental, energy, security, and other reasons.\n       (3) The ability to move people and goods is critical to \n     maintaining State, metropolitan, rural, and local economies.\n       (4) The construction of infrastructure requires the skills \n     of numerous occupations, including those in the contracting, \n     engineering, planning and design, materials supply, \n     manufacturing, distribution, and safety industries.\n       (5) Investing in transportation infrastructure creates \n     long-term capital assets for the Nation that will help the \n     United States address its enormous infrastructure needs and \n     improve its economic productivity.\n       (6) Investment in transportation infrastructure creates \n     jobs and spurs economic activity to put people back to work \n     and stimulate the economy.\n       (7) Every billion dollars in transportation investment has \n     the potential to create up to 47,500 jobs.\n       (8) Every dollar invested in the Nation's transportation \n     infrastructure yields at least $5.70 in economic benefits \n     because of reduced delays, improved safety, and reduced \n     vehicle operating costs.\n       (9) The proposed increases to the Transportation Equity Act \n     for the 21st Century (TEA-21) will not be sufficient to \n     compensate for the Nation's transportation infrastructure \n     deficit.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this subtitle is to provide \n     financing for long-term infrastructure capital investments \n     that are not currently being met by existing transportation \n     and infrastructure investment programs, including mega-\n     projects, projects of national significance and high priority \n     projects, multi-State transportation corridors, intermodal \n     transportation facilities, replacement and reconstruction of \n     deficient and obsolete bridges, interstate highways, public \n     transportation systems, and rail systems.\n\n     SEC. 5673.

Tomorrow, the Senate will resume consideration of S. 1072, \nthe highway bill. The vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the \npending substitute to the highway bill will occur at 9 a.m. It is my \nhope that if cloture is invoked, we will be able to dispose of any \nadditional germane amendments in a timely manner, thereby clearing the \nway to wrap up consideration of the substitute. Once the substitute \namendment is disposed of, we still may require a cloture vote on the \nbill itself. Again, it is my hope that we will be able to speed the \nprocess along and be in a position to complete action on the bill \ntomorrow. It is my intention, however, to remain in session until we \npass this bill.\n  Senators should expect rollcall votes throughout the day tomorrow, \nwith the first vote occurring at approximately 9 a.m. In addition, I \nremind all Senators that all second-degree amendments must be filed at \nthe desk no later than 9 a.m. tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I know the hour is late. I want to \nacknowledge how difficult this has been for the majority leader. This \nhas been extremely difficult. I know there is pressure from a lot of \ndifferent sources to do things differently than we have done this week.\n  I say to the majority leader, whom I compliment for standing firm on \nwhat he believes to be the proper role of the Senate on this matter, \neveryone will have their day. When we complete this legislation--I \nbelieve we will be able to do it tomorrow--the House will do theirs and \nthere will be some process to meld together the legislation from the \ntwo bodies. Then, of course, there will be input from the \nadministration. At this stage we don't have to be concerned about \nvetoes. We are a long way from that.\n  I want the Record to reflect my personal appreciation for the courage \nof the majority leader during this most difficult 2 weeks.\n  Mr. FRIST. I thank the assistant Democratic leader. It has been a \nchallenge for both sides the last 2 weeks as we have been on this bill. \nAgain, we gave the time for discussion and debate, and we had regular \norder throughout using the Senate rules. With that, we will be able to \ncomplete our goal of giving very careful consideration to this bill. At \nthe end of this 2-week period, during which people have had plenty of \ntime, plenty of opportunity to understand what is in this very \nimportant bill, they will have the opportunity to vote. They will have \nthat opportunity tomorrow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/11/senate-section/article/S1192-2", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1192]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 8:30 A.M.
