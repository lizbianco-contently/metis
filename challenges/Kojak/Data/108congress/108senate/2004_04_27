Mr. President, I stand here today to call on Vice \nPresident Dick Cheney to immediately open his records of his secret \nenergy task force meetings and tell the American people the truth about \nwho attended those meetings.\n  The administration needs to stop fighting this wasteful lawsuit. It \nhas cost hundreds of thousands, if not millions of dollars, that belong \nto the taxpayers. And it has consumed an enormous amount of time with \nthe Justice Department and other agencies. Today the case is to be \nheard across the street at the Supreme Court.\n  It is not too late for the Vice President to come clean. Just tell \nthe American people who attended the secret meetings he held before he \nissued his energy policy which took the form of this very expensive, \nbeautiful-colored brochure which has, for example, this picture of \n``Energy for a New Century,'' and it shows an oil rig in the ocean. By \nthe way, that is not exactly the energy of the future.\n  The time has come for the Vice President to stop the stonewalling. \nSimply tell the truth. Who did he meet with in preparing our Nation's \nenergy plan?\n  First, the American people have the right to know. The last I \nchecked, this country was a free country. It is a country where there \nis access to information for the people. We pay the salaries of our \nPresident, our Vice President, our Senators, our House Members. Unless \nit is a question of the highest national security, the people have a \nright to know how their money is being spent or misspent. Why does the \nadministration continue to hide the truth about how its energy policy \nwas formed? It is not necessary to be secretive. It is wrong. The \npublic needs to know how public policies are formulated.\n  To know that, they need to know who was sitting at the table when \nthis national energy policy was put together. Who was there? Was it a \nbroad array of citizens from all sides of the issue--consumers, \nenvironmentalists, people from the oil companies, the gas companies, \nthe nuclear industry--or was it just one set of people?\n  Second, it is time to stop wasting taxpayers' money. The cost of that \nlawsuit across the street is very difficult to pin down. We know the \nGeneral Accounting Office, which tried to force the Vice President to \nreveal who was at the meetings, spent over $300,000 in legal fees to \nfight Dick Cheney's stonewalling. From my office's research, we believe \nattorneys from Justice and the Office of Solicitor General have spent \nthousands of work hours preparing these documents.\n  Let me show a chart on what other things these persons could be doing \nother than keeping the meetings that the Vice President had secreted \nfrom the people. They could have been fighting terrorism by seeking and \nfreezing assets of terrorist groups such as Hamas. They could have been \nprosecuting Medicare fraud. They could have been prosecuting drug \ncompanies that falsify data for FDA drug approval. They could have been \nprosecuting corporations that violate consumer safety laws with toxic \nproducts. All those things are in the public interest.\n  But, no, this Vice President says to these people who work hard every \nday: Just forget about this. We know we said a lot about cracking down \non terrorism, money laundering. We said a lot about cracking down on \nMedicare fraud and drug company fraud and corporations that violate \nconsumer safety laws with toxic products. Just forget it. Defend me. I \nam so important. I am the Vice President and the people have no right \nto know with whom I meet.\n\n  It is outrageous. I want the Justice Department to go after \ncriminals, not to keep meetings secret that should be made public.\n  The Supreme Court has other things to do as well. They defend our way \nof life, our civil liberties, our human rights. For this court to spend \nits time listening to Mr. Cheney defend his secrecy pulls it away from \nother important issues it could address. It is a waste of the Court's \ntime. It is a waste of money.\n  I ask unanimous consent for an additional 2 minutes and ask that \nSenator Durbin have an additional 2 minutes as well.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we ask unanimous consent that the majority \nhave an additional 2 minutes as well, a total of 2 extra minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, the Senator is \nrecognized for an additional 2 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Two Federal judges have already found that the \nadministration has violated the Freedom of Information Act. Openness is \nan American value. In the end, openness is a way of life. Do you \nremember how Condi Rice was not going to testify because the President \nsaid that she only reports to him and what she tells him is secret? \nWell, they caved on that one. They caved on that one because that is \nnot in the public interest, and the people wouldn't stand for it.\n  Do you remember when First Lady Hillary Clinton said she believed she \ndidn't have to reveal who was sitting in on the health care task force \nmeetings? Well, they were sued. And Hillary Clinton, now Senator \nClinton, said: OK, OK. Let's not go to court. I will reveal this \ninformation.\n  But not this administration, not Dick Cheney. He has a lot of time to \nbash Senator John Kerry, but he doesn't have time to open up the files \nand show the people who sat in on those meetings that led to the \nformulation of the national energy policy. It is remarkable--someone \nwho didn't serve 1 minute, 1 hour in the military is taking on a war \nhero, John Kerry. But he doesn't have time to pay attention to this \nissue on which the New York Times editorialized today and said:\n\n       [The Cheney] case also raises more substantive issues about \n     the degree to which a vice president can claim to be above \n     the law.\n\n  This is a sad day. We already know because the Vice President \nadmitted that Ken Lay attended those secret meetings. Yes, he did. Ken \nLay, the man we are hoping will wind up in prison for defrauding the \npeople of California and the people of the west coast of billions of \ndollars. We know he was in the meeting. We also know he handed the Vice \nPresident a document that said: Don't take any action in California.\n  I call on the Vice President, tell the truth. Cut it out. Walk away \nfrom this case and let the people know with whom you met.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Illinois is recognized for 5 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/27/senate-section/article/S4384-3", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4384-S4385]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ATTACK ON JOHN KERRY'S MILITARY SERVICE\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, over 35 years ago, John Kerry faced his \nenemies in Vietnam. There were enemies there who were involved in \nsniper fire against John Kerry, trying to take his life and kill him \nbecause he wore the uniform of the United States of America. Sadly, the \nVietnam snipers are still trying to cause damage to John Kerry.\n  The new Vietnam snipers come from the Bush-Cheney campaign: Karen \nHughes, sadly the Vice President, and other campaign operatives who are \nnow attacking John Kerry because he served our country. He wore the \nuniform of the United States of America. He volunteered and put his \nlife on the line in Vietnam.\n  This shameless exercise by the Bush-Cheney campaign must be called \nfor what it is. Many of us did not serve in the military, even those of \nus in the Vietnam era. We did not volunteer for service as John Kerry \ndid. We didn't wear the uniform of our country proudly as he did. We \ndid not risk our lives. Included in this group is Vice President \nCheney, who used his deferments to avoid military service, as he was \nlegally allowed to do. Yet we now hear Vice President Cheney leading \nthe attack against John Kerry, a man who\n\n[[Page S4385]]\n\nvolunteered, risked his life, and received awards from this country for \nhis heroism.\n  This is an outrageous campaign tactic by the Bush-Cheney campaign. \nThe Republican attack machine on John Kerry has, frankly, criticized \nhim for his two tours of duty in Vietnam. Apparently, that was not \nenough. The fact that John Kerry earned a Silver Star, a Bronze Star, \nand three Purple Hearts wasn't good enough for these Bush-Cheney \ncampaign operatives who never miss a chance to attack John Kerry for \nhis military record.\n  Thank goodness, Senators of the stature of John McCain have stood up \nto defend his fellow Vietnam veteran, John Kerry. They have said that \nJohn's service is clear and unequivocal. He risked his life for \nAmerica. I have met men who were in his crew, those who travel with him \nin his campaign, his so-called ``band of brothers.'' They are in their \nlate fifties and early sixties. They give up what they are doing to \njoin John McCain on the campaign trail. They tell the story. They tell \nthe story of a young Navy lieutenant volunteering to serve this \ncountry, literally risking his life for those in his crew. They join \nhim on the campaign trail, saying they are prepared to follow him into \nbattle again.\n  But listen to what is coming from the other side. To think that those \nwho did not serve in the military are now criticizing John Kerry for \nhis war record is reprehensible. It is time to put the cards on the \ntable. John Kerry not only has nothing to apologize for when it comes \nto his military record, he can be very proud of that. For those who say \nwhen he came back after the war and was critical of our Vietnam policy, \nsomehow that was wrong, once again, listen to Senator John McCain, a \nman who not only served in the U.S. Navy as well but was a prisoner of \nwar. John McCain came forward and said John Kerry had every right to \nmake the statements after the war about his disagreement with our \nforeign policy.\n  What we face today is incredible--that the Bush-Cheney campaign is \ngoing to attack a decorated Vietnam war veteran, raise questions as to \nwhether he was deserving of a Purple Heart. How could they stoop so \nlow? How could they do this when so many other men and women who have \nserved our country, who have been wounded in battle and received Purple \nHearts, have given all we could ever ask of an American citizen? And \nnow to disparage John Kerry and say that perhaps he doesn't deserve all \nof the recognition he has been given for his service in Vietnam is \nabout as low as it gets.\n  I have listened to these comments, and I am particularly disturbed \nthat Vice President Dick Cheney has been the author of so many of these \ncomments as well. Yesterday he was at Westminster College in Fulton, \nMO. He was supposed to give a speech on the foreign policy of the \nUnited States. Vice President Cheney was supposed to speak at \nWestminster College about foreign policy issues in Iraq. Instead, he \nwent on the attack on John Kerry and his patriotism and defense of \nAmerica. It was such an embarrassing moment that, when he left, the \npresident of Westminster College e-mailed the students, staff, and \nfaculty basically apologizing for what Vice President Cheney had said \nthere.\n  Vice President Cheney should know better. He should know that John \nKerry served our country and served it with distinction and honor. \nWhile Vice President Cheney did not serve in the military, John Kerry \ndid. It is time to end this shameful Bush-Cheney campaign tactic and to \nrecognize the obvious: John Kerry led men into battle. He defended \nAmerica. As President of the United States, he will do exactly the \nsame.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oregon is \nrecognized for 10 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/27/senate-section/article/S4385-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4385-S4386]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         OIL COMPANY INCENTIVES\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, most American companies make their profit \nby selling the best product at the best price. But too often in the oil \nindustry it just doesn't seem to work that way. For example, oil \ncompanies can even get a subsidy from the Federal taxpayers for \nshutting down a profitable oil refinery by deducting the cost of that \nshutdown from their taxes.\n  I come to the floor today because I hope Congress will put a stop to \nthe perverse incentives that reward oil companies when they reduce the \nsupply of gasoline and gouge our consumers at the pump. In my view, the \nTax Code simply should not reward companies that shut down a refinery \nto reduce the supply and drive up the price of gasoline. My own view is \nthat Congress ought to be providing incentives to oil companies that \nincrease their production, as long as they comply with the applicable \nenvironmental law.\n  I think we are all pleased when we see corporate profits go up, and \nwe are all pleased when the stocks of those companies go up as well. \nBut what I am troubled about with respect to what is going on in the \noil industry--and we are going to see profits up again this week, and I \ngather some have already been announced--is that too often our \nconsumers are getting hosed.\n  I have been traveling about Oregon over the last few weeks. I have \nwatched as gasoline prices hit over $2 per gallon in some towns. In \nEugene, Springfield, Medford, and Ashland--a number of our \ncommunities--the average price has been $2.06 per gallon. Each penny of \nthat cost is coming out of the pockets of working Oregonians. It is, of \ncourse, helping to increase oil company profits. What I am troubled \nabout is that the taxpayers at the same time are subsidizing practices \nthat are detrimental to their interests.\n  There has clearly been a pattern of extraordinary profits in the oil \nindustry. A prime example was ExxonMobil, which last year announced an \nall-time record earnings of $21.5 billion. That is not just the highest \nearnings ever recorded by an oil company; that is the highest by any \ncompany in history.\n  Again, I want it understood that I like to see our companies make \nprofits. I like it when their stock prices are high. What I don't like \nis when the consumer has to subsidize anti-competitive practices that \nare detrimental to their interests. That has certainly been the case \nwith respect to refineries, when an oil company gets an actual subsidy \nfrom the Federal taxpayers for shutting down a profitable refinery by \ndeducting the cost of the shutdown from their taxes.\n  This matter has special implications out in the West. I see my friend \nfrom Nevada on the floor. He made an excellent presentation with \nrespect to how his State is affected by gasoline prices. All of us in \nthe West are going to be hit, and hit very hard, by Shell's decision to \nclose its Bakersfield refinery. In that instance, there seems to be no \nevidence that Shell has gone out and aggressively tried to find a \nbuyer.\n  Independent analysts have made it clear there is a substantial amount \nof oil in the area. I will tell you, for those of us in the West, \nlooking at that refinery closure in Bakersfield, that deal smells. It \njust doesn't add up to have a profitable refinery going down at a time \nwhen the company doesn't look as if it is moving aggressively to find a \nbuyer. There is oil in the area and, as I have pointed out, the \ntaxpayer subsidizes the closures of these profitable refineries. Yet \nthe Federal Trade Commission has refused to act.\n  I hope to be on the floor very shortly with a bipartisan effort to \naddress the anti-consumer practices. At a minimum, let us not have the \ntaxpayers of America subsidizing anti-competitive practices in the oil \nindustry, such as the shutdown of profitable refineries.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. WYDEN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. Last week, I gave a speech about what is going on in \nNevada. In Nevada, we have gas prices now approaching $2.50 a gallon. \nIf someone wants to put 4 gallons of gas in a vehicle, they have to \nbring a $10 bill with them to do that.\n  I ask my friend his comments on this: Senator Ensign and I asked the \nFederal Trade Commission to take a look at what was going on in Nevada. \nThey took a look and came back and said: We can't tell you why the \nprice is that high. It is unusual, is what they said. It is unusual and \nthey could not determine why gas prices were that high.\n  Does the Senator agree, with the prices going haywire as they are, \nand the consumer being hit very hard, especially in the western part of \nthe United States, that the Federal Trade Commission should do \nsomething more aggressively than what they have done?\n\n[[Page S4386]]\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. The Senator from Nevada is correct. The fact is the \nFederal Trade Commission is AWOL on this issue. It has sent letters to \nall of us in the West saying they are concerned about the issue, but \nthey have not been aggressive in standing up for the consumer.\n  I pointed out today that the oil companies ought to be rewarded \nfinancially when they take actions that benefit the consumer, not when \nthey gouge the consumer. The consumers today are, in effect, getting \nfleeced from this unfair subsidy that is in the Tax Code when a \nprofitable refinery goes down.\n  The Senator from Nevada is absolutely correct. The Federal Trade \nCommission, in my view, is just going through the motions. I think they \nhope somehow this issue is going to pass. All of us in the West--a part \nof the country where there is a very tight supply situation--understand \nthis problem is not going away. I intend to join with the Senator from \nNevada in trying to put the heat on the Federal Trade Commission.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would like to ask the Senator one more \nquestion. The Senator heard the remarks of the Senator from California \nsaying that the Bush administration was actually doing nothing to look \nat the prices. In fact, the administration is in the Supreme Court \ntoday trying to keep secret its dealings with big oil.\n  The Senator would acknowledge that this administration, the \nPresident, and Vice President made their living--certainly part of \ntheir wealth they have accumulated--dealing with oil companies.\n  Does the Senator from Oregon acknowledge that the President has the \nbully pulpit and can certainly ask our so-called friends, Saudi Arabia \nand other countries, to stop cutting back the supply of oil but \nincrease the supply of oil? Would that not also help, I repeat, the \nPresident putting whatever pressure he has--and that is significant--to \ntell the Saudis to start giving us more oil?\n  Mr. WYDEN. I agree fully with the Senator from Nevada. In fact, I \nsubmitted a resolution urging the President do that. In fact, my \nresolution mirrors the resolution that was drafted by our former \ncolleagues, Spence Abraham and John Ashcroft, that passed in 2000 when \nPresident Clinton was faced with the same kind of situation.\n  I am very hopeful that the Senate will take up that resolution and do \nexactly as the Senator from Nevada has said.\n  I also point out that it was very striking, even before this debate \nabout Mr. Woodward's book, that the Saudi Foreign Minister said \nrecently when they cut production--and he was quoted on the news \nservices saying that he was not even contacted by the Bush \nadministration. He heard that the Bush administration was disappointed \nfrom the press, but he was not even contacted by the Bush \nadministration.\n  If ever there were an administration that had earned some chips with \nthe Saudis, given all that our country has done, this is an \nadministration that has done so. I think the points made by the Senator \nfrom Nevada are extremely important.\n  Mr. President, I believe my time has expired. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will use my leader time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/27/senate-section/article/S4386-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4386-S4387]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I wish to talk this morning about the \nambitious education reforms the President signed into law just 2 years \nago. We all recall 2 years ago when President Bush signed the No Child \nLeft Behind Act. We also know it requires States to set high standards \nfor all students and place a well-qualified teacher in every classroom \nand holds schools responsible for results. In exchange, it promises \nschools they will have the resources to meet the new standards and to \nmake the law work.\n  When the President signed it, No Child Left Behind enjoyed \noverwhelming bipartisan support in Congress. It also had strong public \nsupport. Unfortunately, when implementing the law, the administration \nhas often acted in a heavy-handed manner, and it has failed to provide \nschools the resources they need to make sure every child is given the \nopportunity to learn. As a result, there is now a growing backlash \nagainst No Child Left Behind.\n  This is not a partisan issue. A good deal of criticism is coming from \nRepublican lawmakers. In Utah, the Republican-controlled House of \nRepresentatives voted 64 to 8 not to comply with any requirements in \nthe No Child Left Behind Act that are not paid for by the Federal \nGovernment. In Virginia, the Republican-controlled House of Delegates \nvoted 98 to 1 to ask Congress to exempt it from the new law. According \nto the National Conference of State Legislatures, 23 States have now \nlodged formal complaints against No Child Left Behind.\n  One reason for the erosion of support is the initial difficulty many \nschool districts had getting answers from the Department of Education \non how the law would work. It took the Department a long time to issue \nits regulations, and when the rules were finally announced, many \neducators considered them overly rigid.\n  Fortunately, the administration has begun to address some of these \nconcerns. In recent months, the Department of Education has announced \nchanges in the testing requirements for students with serious \ndisabilities and for children who speak English as a second language. \nIt has announced it is giving schools more leeway to meet the \nrequirement that 95 percent of all students be tested.\n  Last month, the Department announced it is giving States more \nflexibility to determine when a teacher is highly qualified. In \naddition, it announced it is giving teachers in rural school districts \nan extra year, until 2007, to show they are qualified in all of their \nsubjects.\n  These are all important changes. The extra year for teachers in rural \ndistricts to meet the new standards is especially important to rural \nStates such as mine which have a harder time attracting and keeping \ngood teachers. I commend the administration for its newfound \nwillingness to try to address some of the real problems.\n  None of us who voted for No Child Left Behind ever intended for the \nFederal Government to dictate to local communities exactly what they \nshould teach their children and how they should test them. It was never \nthe intention of Congress to strangle local decisionmaking and \ncreativity with Federal redtape.\n  It is important the Department of Education continue to listen. It is \ncounterproductive when the education Secretary labels as ``terrorists'' \npeople who raise questions about the way the law is being implemented.\n  It may be, and certainly in this case if it is going to be \nsuccessful, that No Child Left Behind requires something we have not \nseen enough of: a committed partnership. It is the most comprehensive \noverhaul of our Nation's education laws in a generation. Making \nadjustments is not admitting defeat; it is a necessary part of making \nthis ambitious law work. But some of the most serious concerns being \nexpressed about No Child Left Behind cannot be fixed simply by \nrewriting legislation or the regulations.\n  Since he signed No Child Left Behind into law, President Bush sent \nCongress three proposed budgets. When you add all three of his budget \nproposals together, the President has recommended underfunding No Child \nLeft Behind by a staggering $26.5 billion.\n  The President's proposed budget for next year contains $9.4 billion \nless for the act than the law promises. More than $7 billion of that \nshortfall is in title I, the very program that is most critical to \nclosing the achievement gap for minority students, poor children, and \nchildren who do not speak English. The President's education budget \ndoes not leave no child behind; it leaves 4.6 million children behind. \nThe alternative budget proposed by our Republican colleagues in the \nSenate is much better. It underfunds No Child Left Behind by $8.6 \nbillion.\n  The reason we are underfunding education is clear: The administration \nand congressional leadership would rather take more of these resources \nfor tax breaks to the very wealthy than keep the promise we made when \nwe passed No Child Left Behind.\n  The repeated refusal to adequately fund education is hurting schools \nand not just in big cities.\n  In my State, schools in small towns and rural communities are \nstretched\n\n[[Page S4387]]\n\nthin because of their shrinking tax bases and high transportation and \nother costs. They cannot afford any more unfunded mandates from \nWashington.\n  They need help attracting and keeping good teachers.\n  They need help to keep up with advances in technology.\n  I talk to teachers and principals in South Dakota all the time who \ntell me, ``We're not afraid of accountability. We welcome high \nstandards; we know we can meet them. Please, just don't set us up to \nfail.''\n  Last month, during the Senate debate on the budget resolution, we \noffered an amendment sponsored by Senator Ted Kennedy and Senator Patty \nMurray to fully fund No Child Left Behind. Our amendment would have \nprovided exactly what Democrats and Republicans agreed was needed to \nmake the law work when we passed it 2 years ago.\n  Regrettably, Republicans defeated our amendment.\n  But this is not over. There are still months to go before Congress \npasses a final budget. At every opportunity, we are going to continue \nto press for full funding of No Child Left Behind. We will also press \nfor the Federal Government to honor its commitment to shoulder 40 \npercent of the cost of special education.\n  Accountability in education is essential. But accountability has to \nwork both ways. Congress cannot pass the most sweeping education \nreforms in a generation and then refuse, year after year, to pay for \nthem. The reforms in No Child Left Behind are the right reforms for our \nchildren's schools. But they will not work if we refuse to fund them.\n  I recently received a letter from an elementary-school student in \nSouth Dakota. Because of budget shortfalls, her school district is \nconsidering merging with another district.\n  She wrote, ``Even though we are just two small towns in South Dakota, \nthe Burke school means very much to me.''\n  Then she added, ``I know that NASA is trying to help mankind, but \nright now, my school needs that $3 trillion more! . . . I'm in the \nfifth grade. . . . The school means very much to me, so please HURRY.''\n  Budgets are statements of our priorities and values.\n  Before we vote to spend trillions of dollars to make permanent the \nPresident's tax breaks for the very wealthiest Americans, and before we \nspend hundreds of billions more to send a person to Mars, we need to \nfund our children's schools.\n  In his first budget address to Congress, President Bush said, ``The \nhighest percentage increase in our budget should go to our children's \neducation.'' Yet, the President's proposed budget for next year \nincludes the smallest increase for education in 9 years.\n  We must restore the broad, bipartisan support for No Child Left \nBehind that existed 2 years ago. To do that, we must fund the law.\n  The Federal Government needs to keep its end of the agreement. Words \nalone are not enough. Real reform requires real resources.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, I rise to address the issue of \nprescription drugs as part of Medicare, a new provision dealing with \nMedicare, but before I do I will comment on the two issues that have \nbeen brought up by Democratic Members of the Senate. I only do that \nbecause I think it is appropriate people know that there are two sides \nto every story--maybe five sides but at least two in the Senate.\n  I do not find fault with my Democratic friends for bringing issues to \nthe Senate floor, but in the case of the high cost of gasoline as an \nexample, which the Senator from Oregon was talking about, all I can say \nis we had a national energy policy before the Senate. It passed the \nHouse last year; it passed the Senate last year. We spent a couple of \nmonths in conference and worked out a very good compromise. It passed \nthe House of Representatives by a wide margin. Exactly how much I do \nnot recall. Then it came to the Senate and we were faced with a \nfilibuster.\n  In that filibuster cloture vote, we got 58 votes. It obviously takes \n60 votes to stop a filibuster. Out of those 58 votes, we only had 13 \nout of 49 Democrats vote to break that filibuster. So there are another \n36 Democrats that if they want to help us reduce the cost of energy, I \nwould beg them to tell our leader that they are prepared to break that \nfilibuster. The leader filed a motion to reconsider. We could bring \nthat up again and within 2 minutes we would have a national energy \npolicy that would send a clear signal to OPEC that we have our energy \nhouse in order in this country, and hopefully let them know they are \nnot going to have an economic stranglehold on our economy as they \nevidently think they have by reducing their production of oil by 4 \npercent as they did a month ago.\n  Why would we not expect the OPEC nations to take advantage of a \ndivided Congress when we all know, with the energy blackout in the \nNortheast last August and with $2 gasoline right now in the United \nStates, that this country ought to be doing everything it can to solve \nits energy problem?\n  The national energy policy we had before Congress last fall that \nthere was a Democrat filibuster against would be a solution because it \nemphasizes in a very balanced way three things: One, tax incentives for \nthe enhanced production of fossil fuels; No. 2, tax incentives for \nrenewable fuels, wind energy, ethanol, biodiesel, biomass; and tax \nincentives for conservation, such as fuel cell cars.\n  So when we have an effort to bring a national energy policy before \nthis Congress, and it is defeated by a filibuster that only 13 out of \n49 Democrats would support, then it seems to me very wrong for people \non the other side of the aisle to be complaining about the high price \nof gasoline.\n  Now, it is all right to complain about the high price of gasoline \nbecause I do every time I go to fill up my car, but on the other hand, \nit is one thing to complain about it and not do anything about it. What \nwe need to do is join forces to get this national energy bill passed. \nIt would help if we could get two more Democrats to help us defeat that \nfilibuster.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/27/senate-section/article/S4387-2", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4387]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EDUCATION FUNDING\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. As to the issue of education, all I can point out is \nthat this President has always had education very high on his agenda. \nExcept for September 11 and the war that we are now involved in, \neducation would be No. 1 on this President's agenda. But because of the \nwar, we are in a budget situation now where we are having 10-percent \nincreases for homeland security, 7-percent increases for defense \nbecause of the war, and we are having 3-percent increases for \neducation. Now, that may be, as the distinguished Democratic leader \nsaid, the smallest increase in education for years, but this 3-percent \nincrease in education is far higher than anything else in the domestic \nbudget that the President proposed to the Congress of the United States \nbecause every other domestic program in that budget is going to be \nincreased nine-tenths of 1 percent.\n  So when we are involved in war, whether it is the 21st century war on \nterrorism or whether it is the 20th century war on fascism, World War \nII, this country puts all of its efforts behind the men and women who \nare on the front line, giving them all of the resources they need to \nwin that war because we only go to war if we go to war to win. This \nPresident has done that. But, after taking care of our responsibilities \nto the men and women on the battlefield, this President has always had \neducation at the top of his agenda. With the way this year's budget \ntreats education compared to every other domestic program, and only \nthird to homeland security and the war, this President is keeping his \ncommitment to education.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/27/senate-section/article/S4387-3", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4387-S4390]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Now I would like to address the issue of the Medicare \nprescription drug program, because on January 1, the seniors of America \nare going to make a voluntary decision\n\n[[Page S4388]]\n\nwhether they want to take advantage of this new program, and January 1 \nwould be the opportunity to take advantage of the interim program for \nthe years 2004 and 2005, before the permanent insurance program on \nprescription drugs kicks in November 15, 2005.\n  It was just under 5 months ago that the President signed this \nMedicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act. It was \nthe first strengthening of Medicare in its 30-year history. Next \nMonday, then, beneficiaries can begin enrolling in the Medicare-\napproved drug discount card, the first stage of what I call the \ntemporary program of the new comprehensive Medicare Modernization Act. \nThe cards go into effect June 1 and will offer seniors much needed \ndiscounts and information on brand name and generic prescription drugs.\n  Medicare beneficiaries who choose to enroll in the voluntary discount \ncard will have choices. I emphasize, this is not something the seniors \nof America have to do. This is a voluntary program. Not only is it \nvoluntary whether you join the program, but the seniors will have \nchoices within their voluntary decision to join, because there are 38 \nsponsors offering cards to Medicare beneficiaries nationwide, with some \nsponsors offering more than one card. More than 40 Medicare advantage \nplans--the Medicare+Choice, or let's say the Medicare HMOs, as some \npeople know it--offer Medicare beneficiaries additional coverage. They \nwill offer exclusive cards to their members.\n  There also will be regional cards offered to certain beneficiaries, \nsuch as those in nursing homes throughout our country.\n  Under the drug discount card, beneficiaries will save 10 percent to \n25 percent off the retail prices that they paid before they had a \nMedicare-endorsed discount card. In fact, a study recently in Health \nAffairs, a peer-reviewed journal of health policy, estimates that if \nseniors who currently lack prescription drug coverage enroll in a \nMedicare-approved drug discount program, they can expect to reduce \ntheir out-of-pocket drug spending by approximately 17.4 percent.\n  There is still more good news. One of the most important parts of \nthis drug bill is the nearly immediate help to very low income Medicare \nbeneficiaries, people who do not have prescription drug coverage and \nwho do not qualify for Medicaid.\n  Low-income beneficiaries--and that would be generally those with \nincomes under 135 percent of poverty--are helped in two ways. They get \na discounted price and they get up to $600 annually in 2004 and 2005 to \nhelp buy drugs they need at the pharmacy. The beneficiaries would get \naccess to the $600 in assistance through the Medicare-endorsed discount \ncard. The card will be just like a debit card. When the card is \npresented to your pharmacy, the beneficiaries are able to draw down \nfrom the $600 and purchase their prescription drugs. They can continue \nto use that until it has run out, between now and December 31.\n  If they have some money left over on that card on December 31, 2004, \nthat can carry over until year 2005, and they can get an additional \n$600 in the year 2005. If they didn't have that full $1,200 used by \nDecember 1, 2005, it can carry over until 2006, until it is all used \nand they take full advantage of the insurance program that is going \ninto effect at that particular time.\n\n  Also, let me make it very clear that if there are two in the family \nwho would qualify for the $600, then that family would get $1,200 in \n2004, and an additional $1,200 in 2005, until it is used then, either \nin 2005 or carried over to 2006.\n  I should probably use a lot of examples but I just want to use one \nexample of a woman enrolled in Medicare in Waterloo, IA, near my farm. \nIf she had an income of $12,000 a year and she needed to fill a \nprescription for Celebrex, the retail price for 30 tablets would be \n$86.28. This woman from Waterloo, IA, would save nearly $22 a month off \nthe retail price and be able to draw down some of her $600 in \nassistance to pay for the discounted prescription that lady needs. The \n$600 credit in conjunction with the discount card will give these most \nvulnerable low-income citizens immediate help in purchasing \nprescription drugs that they otherwise, maybe, would not be able to \nafford or maybe would have to make a very difficult choice between \nbuying food or buying prescription drugs. We hope this eases that \nchoice which some seniors and disabled people in America must make \ntoday.\n  We expect more than 7 million beneficiaries to enroll in this \nprogram. Nearly 5 million low-income beneficiaries are expected to \napply for this $600 of assistance--$600 in 2004 and $600 in 2005; \nhusband and wife qualifying, that will be $1,200 in 2004 and $1,200 in \n2005.\n  What we need to do now is to continue to let people know about the \navailability of the card and to help them get information to make \nenrollment decisions to sign up for the $600 in additional assistance.\n  I commend the Center for Medicare Services' staff for their work in \nthis area. They are doing much to help people understand this \nsituation.\n  If I were going to summarize before I go into it, I could say, as I \ndid in my 36 town meetings in Iowa that I have held since January to \nacquaint Iowans with this new prescription drug program, that I \nprovided four sources of information. One would be if they want to \ncontact any congressional office, including mine, I think they would \nfind that as a source of information. No. 2 would be the 1-800 Medicare \ntoll-free number to which I will soon refer. Also, I had the benefit of \nhaving personnel from the federally financed but State-insurance-\ndepartment-administered program called SHIIP, the Senior Health \nInsurance Information Program. That program in my State of Iowa, and I \nassume in most States, will give people one-on-one consultation about \nhow to compare the benefits of the prescription drug program with what \ntheir health care needs are and what their income happens to be. Those \nare all private matters that our constituents are not going to want to \nmake public. So they have the benefit of the SHIIP employees and \nvolunteers working with them to help them work through which program \nmight be best for them.\n  Then, of course, we have the AARP, which is an organization, I tell \nIowa constituents, that deserves great benefit for bringing about the \nbipartisanship in the Senate that it took to get this legislation \npassed and signed by the President.\n  Without the AARP we would not have a prescription drug program for \nseniors. The AARP has attended a lot of my meetings. I have not heard \none criticism of the AARP at any of my 36 town meetings. The AARP \nrepresentative has been present to tell how that organization can help \npeople get information about this new prescription drug program. The \nAARP probably has the best layperson's explanation of this legislation \nthat is available. I hand those out at my town meetings as well.\n  I commend the Center for Medicare Services for their help in this \narea. I would like to say what their help has been beyond what I have \njust said.\n  They helped develop an Internet-based tool that will help seniors \nlearn more about the available discount card options. By using this \ntool, which will be up and running yet this week, beneficiaries will be \nable to compare the particular drugs and prices offered by senior \nsponsors. The Internet site can even tell them whether their \nneighborhood pharmacy participates in a particular card. But we know \nthat not all beneficiaries feel comfortable using the Internet. Those \nwho don't can call 1-800-Medicare and ask for information about the \ncard being sent to them.\n  The Center for Medicare Services also has taken important steps to \nstreamline the enrollment process by having the standard enrollment \nform and allowing States under certain circumstances to enroll low-\nincome Medicare beneficiaries into this card program. This will make it \neasier for low-income beneficiaries in States with pharmacy assistance \nprograms to get the additional $600.\n  The card sponsors will also be closely monitored by CMS to ensure \nthat they are playing by the rules and not cheating anybody. CMS will \ntrack any changes made in the drug prices and complaints received by \ntheir 1-800-Medicare number or other sources. They will also ``mystery \nshop'' to make sure the sponsors are not falsely advertising. They will \nbe on the lookout out for scam artists who claim to be offering an \napproved card. While I am confident that most card sponsors will do the \nright thing, I am very pleased that\n\n[[Page S4389]]\n\nCMS will be dedicating resources to protect beneficiaries and in turn \nthe Medicare trust fund as well.\n  I want to respond to some accusations that were made yesterday by \nSenators from the other side of the aisle about this bill. It is a \ncarping we often hear that is very inaccurate, and I want to make sure \nthat constituents know what the true story is.\n  I want to clarify once again important details and answer concerns--\nparticularly inaccurate concerns--that were offered on the other side \nof the aisle.\n  Some have argued that our seniors would receive a greater benefit \nunder this Part D drug benefit which I have been speaking about, set to \nbegin in 2006, if the Government would step in on negotiations between \ndrug manufacturers and prescription drug plans. This is not accurate. \nThis noninterference provision allows seniors to get a good deal \nthrough market competition rather than through price fixing by the \nFederal Government.\n  A basic concern we have is that in writing the legislation the way we \ndid, we don't want some government bureaucrat in the medicine cabinets \nof our seniors. We don't want that bureaucrat coming between our doctor \nand our patient. That is why that provision is in this bill. The \nprovision protects patients by keeping government out of decisions \nabout which medicines they will be able to receive. Under this section, \nthe Government will not be able to dictate which drug should or should \nnot be included in the prescription drug plan.\n\n  The new Medicare Part D drug benefit allows seniors to use their \ngroup buying power to drive down drug prices. We rely on market \ncompetition--not price fixing by the Government--to deliver the drug \nbenefit.\n  The reason we know this works is because it has worked for 40 years \nin the Federal Employee Health Benefit Plan. There is no bureaucrat \ntelling some Federal employee what their plan can provide to them in \nthe way of drugs.\n  The law's entire approach is to get seniors the best deal through \nvigorous market competition and not through price controls.\n  These private plans have strong incentives under this legislation to \nnegotiate the best possible deals on drug prices. These plans are at \nrisk for a large part of the cost of the benefit. They also have the \nmarket clout to obtain large discounts. By driving hard bargains, they \nwill be able to offer lower Part D premiums and attract more enrollees.\n  The alternative is a command-and-control system that would not be \nresponsive to consumer desires or to marketplace reality. Bureaucrats \nwould swing between adding benefit requirements without a means of \npaying for them and then restricting choices and access in an effort to \ncontain costs. The noninterference provision is a fundamental \nprotection against such inexplicable government bureaucratic action.\n  We are also hearing complaints from the other side of the aisle even \nafter three or four times last month straightening them out about what \nthe true cost of this drug program is. What is the true cost? You look \nahead 10 years to what a program is going to cost, and you make the \nbest judgment you can of what it is going to cost. There are good \npeople in the Congressional Budget Office who are good at that and who \ntry to do the best thing, but you aren't going to know until 10 years \nhave passed what the true cost is.\n  It seems to me to be intellectually dishonest for people telling us \nthat somebody downtown can tell us what the true cost of this \nlegislation is. I am going to respond to those accusations about what \nthe true cost of the Medicare bill is for a third time. I am going to \ndo it for a fourth time and a fifth time if I have to until somebody on \nthe other side of the aisle learns something about what this bill does \nor doesn't do.\n  They are trying to say that somehow the true cost was hidden from \nCongress. This is simply election year hyperbole. The opponents of the \ndrug benefit are making this claim because the final cost estimate from \nthe Center for Medicare Service's Office of the Actuary was not \ncompleted before the vote took place. But let us be clear: The cost \nestimate was not withheld from Congress because there was not a final \ncost estimate from the Center for Medicare Services to withhold. But \nthey don't even know what this so-called cost is because they have to \nlook ahead 10 years and make the best educated estimate they can 10 \nyears ahead of time just like the Congressional Budget Office does. But \ntheir estimate wasn't even completed until December 23. The President \nsigned the bill December 10.\n  Let me also make clear that the Congress had an official cost \nestimate on the Medicare bill before the vote, and that is the one from \nthe Congressional Budget Office. I keep telling people who don't \nunderstand the importance of the Congressional Budget Office, which \nguides every Member of U.S. Senate, that when they say something costs \nsomething, even if they are wrong, that is what it costs. You don't \ndispute it. The ability to raise a point of order against the bill if \nyou exceed that cost takes 60 votes. That is how important the \nCongressional Budget Office is. That is the only office we go by.\n  Somebody can make a complaint that maybe some administrator downtown \nwas muzzled into not talking to Congress, but they were talking to me. \nI don't know why other Members of Congress couldn't have had the same \ninformation I had, and it wasn't much information at that. But you can \ntalk. If somebody was muzzled in our Government where transparency and \nopenness ought to be the rule, that is wrong, I agree, but these \naccusations about whether the information was withheld have raised \nquestions of whether Congress had access to a valid and thorough cost \nestimate for the prescription drug bill before the final vote in \nNovember.\n  It should also be made clear while the cost analysis by the Office of \nthe Actuary is perhaps helpful, it is not the one Congress relies on. \nCongress relies exclusively upon cost projections by the Congressional \nBudget Office. It is CBO's cost estimate we use to determine whether \nlegislation is within authorized budget limits.\n  For Congress, if there is a true cost estimate, that is CBO's. And \ntrue costs can, at best, be said as a 10-year guesstimate, an educated \nguess into the future, and it would be the Congressional Budget \nOffice's. CBO's cost estimate is the only one that matters.\n  When Congress approved a $400 billion reserve fund to create a \nMedicare prescription drug benefit, this meant $400 billion according \nto the Congressional Budget Office, not according to the Center for \nMedicare Services, as the other side would somehow say, that would have \na definitive impact upon Congress.\n  You do not raise a point of order in this body against an estimate by \nthe Center for Medicare Services or even the Office of Management and \nBudget that speaks for the entire executive branch of Government.\n  With all due respect to the dedicated staff who work at the Center \nfor Medicare Services, Office of the Actuary, their cost estimates were \nirrelevant to our decision making process.\n  The Congressional Budget Office worked closely with the conferees--\nand I was one of those conferees--to the prescription drug bill and the \nstaff of our Finance and Ways and Means Committees to ensure a full \nanalysis of the projected costs was completed. The conferees and the \nstaff regularly and constantly consulted with the Congressional Budget \nOffice throughout the development of the Senate bill and in the \npreparation of the conference agreement.\n  The Congressional Budget Office worked nearly around the clock and on \nweekends for months to complete an extremely thorough and rigorous cost \nanalysis of the prescription drug bill. That cost estimate--our \nofficial cost estimate, straight from the god of Congress's finance \nestimating, the Congressional Budget Office--was available to every \nMember of Congress before the measure was presented to the House and \nSenate for a vote.\n  It is also pretty disingenuous for opponents of the Medicare bill, \nespecially on the other side of the aisle, to suggest the pricetag for \nthe Medicare bill causes concern because the fact is they supported \nproposals that cost hundreds of billions of dollars more. You would \nthink they would say: Thank God for the Center for Medicare Services \nthat this bill is going to cost $134 billion\n\n[[Page S4390]]\n\nmore than what the Congressional Budget Office said it was going to \ncost because we like to spend money. We want to spend more on Medicare \nprescription drugs.\n  The House Democratic proposal, for instance, last year would have \ncost $1 trillion compared to the $395 billion the President signed. The \nSenate Democratic proposal in 2002 cost $200 billion more than the bill \nthat was enacted into law.\n  Further, there were more than 50 amendments offered on the floor of \nthe Senate during the debate on the Senate bill that would have \nincreased the cost of the bill by tens of billions of dollars.\n  The bottom line is, there should be no doubt in anyone's mind we had \nas true a cost estimate--or if they want to put it in their words, the \ntrue cost estimate--for the prescription drug bill last year. Everyone \nhad access to it before the vote.\n\n  But let me explain to the people of this country that whether it is \nthe Congressional Budget Office or the Center for Medicare Services, \nwhen they look ahead 10 years, and the farther out you go, it is a \nfairly imprecise way of deciding what a bill we passed last year is \nactually going to cost. The true cost is going to be known on that 10th \nyear.\n  But these professional people with green eyeshades, without any \npolitical predilection, study what we put on paper and they say: \nSenator Grassley, as chairman of the Finance Committee, if you do this, \nit is going to cost X number of dollars. So if it does not all fit into \n$400 billion, you kind of tailor it to fit, because if you do not, you \nare going to be subject to a point of order and you will have to have \n60 votes to override it.\n  I hope I have once again cleared up any misunderstandings about these \nissues. We should move on and not lose sight of what really matters: \nhelping our Nation's seniors get the drugs they need at lower prices \nthrough the Medicare discount card, and $600 of additional assistance, \nwhich beneficiaries can begin enrolling in next week, and through the \nvoluntary Part D drug benefit in 2006, which is what really matters.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/27/senate-section/article/S4390-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4390]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Talent).

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of the motion to proceed to S. 150, which the \nclerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A motion to proceed to the bill (S. 150) to make permanent \n     the moratorium on taxes on Internet access and multiple and \n     discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce imposed by the \n     Internet Tax Freedom Act.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nTennessee controls 2 hours of time.\n  Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, yesterday we began our discussion of \nlegislation which, if it should pass, would be a Federal law giving a \ntax break or a subsidy to the high-speed Internet industry, and the \nFederal law would then send the bill for that to State and local \ngovernments. There is a bipartisan group of us who object to that, who \nbelieve if Congress wants to give a subsidy to the fastest growing \ntechnology, high-speed Internet access, then Congress ought to pay for \nit and not send the bill to State and local governments.\n  I, for one, also question whether there is any need to spend \nadditional taxpayer dollars on this sort of subsidy since, as far as I \ncan tell, high-speed Internet access must already be the most heavily \nsubsidized technology in the country. But, nevertheless, we have \nreached a point in the discussion where we are trying to create a \ncompromise result.\n  To go back through a little bit of history, the House of \nRepresentatives sent a bill to the Senate toward the end of last year, \nand that bill, while it was named ``Internet tax moratorium,'' did much \nmore than that. It purported to make permanent the temporary timeout \nfrom taxes the Federal Government set in 1998, and then renewed in \n2000, on State and local taxation of Internet access, but the bill did \nmuch more than that.\n\n  As I pointed out at length last night, the House bill exempted this \nindustry from a great many State and local taxes--telephone taxes \nStates currently collect, business taxes States currently collect, more \nbusiness taxes, and then sales taxes. So for all of these, we had the \nFederal Government saying to the State governments: You cannot do this; \nYou cannot collect these taxes.\n  We have a phrase for this. We call it unfunded Federal mandates. It \nmeans: Do no harm to State and local governments.\n  The Republican majority was elected in 1995, promising to end the \npractice of we Congressmen and Senators coming up with some big idea, \ntaking credit for it, and then sending the bill to State and local \ngovernments. So we went to work to try to change the bill. Senator \nCarper of Delaware and I and nine other Senators of both parties \noffered a compromise. We said: Since the Federal Communications \nCommission, and since Senator McCain and the Commerce Committee, and \nSenator Stevens, our President pro tempore, and others, have said we \nneed to take a comprehensive look at this phenomenon of digital \nmigration of services to the Internet that is being caused by this new \nhigh-speed Internet access, since we want to do that, let's take a \ncomprehensive look at it, so let's just extend the old moratorium for a \ncouple more years.\n  In the meantime, let's try to create a level playing field so all \nhigh-speed Internet access providers are treated the same and do no \nharm to State and local governments. That is the Alexander-Carper \nproposal.\n  The majority leader and Senator McCain and others asked me and \nSenator Carper to work with Senator Allen and Senator Wyden and others \nto see if we could narrow our differences. We did, but we still had \ndifferences.\n  As I pointed out yesterday, Senator Allen's bill, S. 150, which is \nthe bill we are now considering, is permanent, not temporary. It still \nputs at risk $3 to $10 billion that State and local governments \ncollect. It also causes the sales taxes that were being collected to \nexpire.\n  Let's recall that what we are talking about is not lowering anybody's \ntaxes. If you lower one tax, another tax is going to go up, or the \ngovernment is going to be cut. Lower taxes for the service industry \nmeans higher taxes for somebody else. That is a fact.\n  Then Senator McCain came to the floor yesterday and offered a new \nproposal. I want to comment for the next 3 or 4 minutes on that. I have \nwritten Senator McCain a letter outlining my reaction to it, which I \nhope is being delivered now, but since we only received his proposal \nyesterday afternoon at about 2:15, I want to let the full Senate and \nothers know my reaction to his proposal.\n  First, I appreciate his proposal and his efforts to create a \ncompromise. We all want a result. That is why we are moving ahead at \n2:15 to consider his proposal. Unfortunately, Senator McCain's new \nproposal still harms States and still creates a huge loophole for the \nhigh-speed Internet industry.\n  Let me be specific. No. 1, the definition that the McCain proposal \nuses is the same definition the Allen-Wyden proposal uses. That \ndefinition eliminates $500 million annually of telephone taxes, \nbusiness taxes that State and local governments collect today. That is \nan unfunded mandate.\n  No. 2, the bill does not protect States and their ability to make a \ndecision about whether to continue collecting taxes on telephone \nservices. This is very important to State and local governments. Last \nyear, according to the National Governors Association, State and local \ngovernments collected $18 billion in taxes on telephone services. In \nthe State of Tennessee, it was $361 million. In California and Florida \nand Texas, it is more than $1 billion. It is 5 percent of our State \nbudget. Almost every State is affected by this. While Senator McCain's \nlegislation in one section appears to try to protect telephone calls \nmade over the Internet so that States may choose to continue to\n\n[[Page S4391]]\n\ntax telephone services as opposed to food, for example, it doesn't do \nthat. So that is the second problem with the bill. It takes away from \nthe States a substantial tax base.\n  No. 3, the bill is 4 years in duration. We think 15 months, 2 years \nwould be much better. Four years is better than permanent, but once you \nfreeze into place these decisions, it is like trying to take a \nbillboard down. You can prevent one going up, but you can't ever take \nit down. We believe 4 years is not much better than permanent. And then \nthere is the grandfather clause. The moratorium is 4 years starting \nlast November. The States that were already taxing Internet access with \nsales taxes before this legislation moratorium took effect in 1998, we \nthink those States and other States now collecting taxes on high-speed \nInternet access should be permitted to continue to exercise their \noption to collect those taxes.\n  I have suggested to Senator McCain in my letter that there is a way \nto fix each of these four problems. The way to fix the definition \nproblem is to use the language of the original moratorium. After all, \nif all we are doing is extending for 4 years the original moratorium on \nState and local taxation of Internet access, why not use the original \nmoratorium?\n  No. 2, make the extension for no more than 2 years.\n  No. 3, express in plain English what I have heard the Senator from \nVirginia say, that he has no intention of trying to ban State and local \ntaxation of telephone calls made over the Internet. So why not say, \n``nothing in this Act shall preclude State and local governments from \ntaxing telephone services, including telephone calls made over the \nInternet''?\n\n  And, finally, all the grandfather clauses should end at the same time \nthe moratorium expires.\n  I am glad Senator McCain worked to offer this new proposal. I regret \nthat it still has many of the same problems of the original proposal. \nThe term is a little better. The protection for State prerogatives on \ntaxing telephone services is worse. But I would hope we could take the \nfour suggestions I have made and correct the McCain proposal. If we \ncan, we can pass a bill and get on to something else. I wanted to come \nto the floor quickly, after we have had a chance to review the \nproposal, to make those suggestions.\n  I will return to the floor within a few minutes with further \ncomments. For now, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Chair wishes to inform the Senator he has approximately 81 \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, sometimes when we talk about this \nInternet tax proposal, eyes glaze over. It is a hard subject for people \nto get into their brain because we are talking about a new way of doing \nthings. We are talking about Internet access, how one connects their \ncomputer, for example, to the Internet, but we are especially, in this \ncase, talking about high-speed Internet access.\n  High-speed Internet access has been known to us just for the last few \nyears. When Congress passed the Telecommunications Act of 1996, it is \npossible that nobody in Congress had ever heard of high-speed Internet \naccess. The commercial Internet was just a few years old at that time.\n  High-speed Internet access is another one of America's great \nadventures. The Industrial Revolution was caused by the internal \ncombustion engine. That was a great invention.\n  The telephone was a great invention. Television was a great \ninvention. The use of high-speed Internet access is a great discovery. \nWhat is possible with it is that suddenly a lot of the everyday \nservices of life, such as making telephone calls as an example, \ndownloading movies, even watching our regular television channels, may \nbe done through the Internet. Maybe it will be easier; maybe it will be \nless expensive; maybe there will be some other advantages.\n  So for a long time, everybody has been excited about high-speed \nInternet access, which we call broadband. As a result of that \nexcitement, there has been a phenomenal amount of subsidy of high-speed \nInternet access by the Government.\n  The Federal Government spends approximately $4 billion a year already \nto encourage the spread of high-speed Internet access. Almost every \nState spends its taxpayers' money to encourage the growth of the high-\nspeed Internet access industry.\n  The State of Texas, for example, has done at least two things. One is \nthat it has a fund. Texas does things in a big way. So it is collecting \n$1.5 billion over 10 years, which will be spent to encourage high-speed \nInternet access just in Texas.\n  Also, in 1999, when President Bush was Governor Bush, Texas decided \nit would give consumers a break on high-speed Internet access. Texas \nsaid the first $25 a consumer pays for their high-speed Internet access \nbill each month is exempt from the State sales tax. That is what Texas \nhas done since 1999.\n  Now, the irony is that the Governors and States of this country came \nto Congress and said, Why do we not make President Bush's Texas plan \nthe national plan? That really helps consumers. It is pretty easy to \nunderstand.\n  I am in Tennessee, the Chair is in Missouri, somebody else is in \nTexas, and we all get the bill each month from our Internet service \nprovider. Now consumers can get this high-speed Internet access a lot \nof places. They can get it from their Internet service provider, such \nas America Online, for example, or they can get it from their cable \ncompany, the person who brings people television, or they can get it \nfrom their telephone company. They will charge about $30 or $40 a month \nfor that.\n  In Manassas, VA, consumers can get it from their power company. That \nhas helped us understand that there is not going to be any digital \ndivide problem. Almost everybody, thanks to the rural electrification \nsystem, has a power wire running to their home or near their home and \nthey can get their high-speed Internet access from the electric \ncompany. They do it in Manassas, VA. It costs $25 a month, which is \njust the amount of money President Bush, when he was Governor Bush, \nthought ought to be the subsidy to consumers who decided to use this \nfastest growing new technology in the United States, high-speed \nInternet access.\n\n  The reason I raise that is, since we already had that in Texas, what \nif the States say to the Congress that we will accept that unfunded \nFederal mandate? We will ask for that one. You know, just exempt all of \nour 100 million consumers across the country from the $1- to $3-a-month \nbill that they will pay in taxes on high-speed Internet access.\n  But, no, from the House comes this legislation last year that would \ndrive a Mack truck through the State budgets of virtually every State. \nIt would drive it through the State of Texas, too. The State of Texas \ncollects $1.7 billion a year in taxes on telephone services. That comes \nfrom the National Governors Association. This year they called up all \nthe States and got this information. State and local governments, in \ntaxes, collect $1.7 billion a year on telephone services.\n  Under the proposal that is coming to the floor this afternoon that \nSenator McCain has suggested, as those telephone calls are made over \nthe Internet, they would be tax free. That sounds good at first, until \nyou think about what comes next. Let's say Texas loses a third of its \nrevenues from telecommunications taxes. Let's be conservative about \nthis. Of the $1.7 billion that Texas collects on taxes on telephone \nservices, only about a billion comes from telephone calls. These are \nthe monthly bills that you get.\n  So Texas collects $1 billion a year. According to the Congressional \nBudget Office, in a letter to the Senate that I had printed in the \nRecord yesterday, the estimate is that within the next 5 years at least \na third of all the telephone calls will be made over the Internet.\n  I think it is coming faster than that. I believe Michael Powell, the \nChairman of the Federal Communications Commission, believes it is \ncoming faster than that.\n\n[[Page S4392]]\n\n  So under the McCain proposal, Texas loses one-third of the revenues \nit collects in telephone services. That is $300 million a year. In \nTennessee, it is $100 million.\n  Then that keeps going. So gradually if you are the Governor of Texas, \nyou are the legislators of Texas--and I know right now they, as most \nStates, are going through a difficult time financially--they are \ntalking about other taxes in Texas so they can pay for their schools.\n  But I can predict what is going to happen in Texas and in Tennessee \nand in Washington State and in Florida. Florida collects $1.4 billion \nin taxes a year on telephone services. About $1 billion of that is from \ntelephone calls.\n  Take all that out and what happens, dancing in the streets because \npeople aren't paying taxes on telephone calls over the Internet? No. \nWhat is going to happen is that some unfortunate Governor in Texas and \nin Florida is going to have to propose a State income tax.\n  You may stand up and say we should reduce taxes by $1 billion in \nTexas, or reduce it by $1 billion in Florida, and maybe you can. Maybe \nyou can. But that is a substantial challenge to those States.\n  What we are really doing here is something I never thought I would \nsee. We have legislation which has zoomed through the House and which \nthe distinguished chairman of the Commerce Committee, despite his \nefforts to have meetings and to compromise, is still insisting on, is \nthat we in the Congress give a big subsidy to the high-speed Internet \naccess industry and send the bill to State and local governments, and \nit is a potentially big bill.\n  I suggested in my earlier remarks that the McCain proposal can be \neasily fixed. For example, we can just say: Nothing in this act shall \npreclude State and local governments from taxing telephone services, \nincluding telephone calls made over the Internet. That is very plain \nEnglish.\n\n  I don't know why we don't try plain English in a statute every now \nand then. That would remove a lot of that problem. Then we could make \nit a 2-year extension instead of 4 and that only leaves two problems. \nOne is the definition of Internet access. They have cooked up a new \none. We had one since 1998. We banned taxes on Internet access in 1998. \nWe did it again in 2000. I supported that. Instead of really banning \ntaxes on Internet access, they are creating a big tax subsidy to a \nwhole industry. We could fix the definition problem by going to the \nAlexander-Carper definition, which we suggested in December, or just by \ngoing to the 1998 definition. Then we could make all the grandfather \nclauses expire at the same time the moratorium ends, that would be it, \nand we could pass the bill and be on to reducing taxes for \nmanufacturing companies.\n  Sometimes I think I have not been able to get my point across as \neffectively as I would like. I was thinking about it this way. The \nPresiding Officer is the Senator from Kentucky. Kentucky has a big \nToyota plant. I visited with the chairman of Toyota in Tokyo a few \nweeks ago. Toyota is leading the way--Ford is doing a lot, Nissan is \ndoing a great deal, other companies are--in hybrid cars. I see the \nSenator from Delaware, and I am going to yield to him within 3 or 4 \nminutes. They tell me at Toyota in Tokyo that Toyota is selling hybrid \ncars in America this year at the rate of 100,000 this year. That is \nvery important in Tennessee because we have a big clean air problem and \nhybrid cars have electric motors and internal combustion engines both \nand burn less gas and pollute the air less, so the air would be cleaner \nin Tennessee. So I am thinking about, perhaps, recommending a Federal \nlaw that tells Kentucky and Tennessee and Delaware they cannot tax \nhybrid cars.\n  Why wouldn't that be a good idea? That would clean the air.\n  The reason it would not be a good idea is that in Delaware and \nKentucky and Tennessee, some unfortunate Governor and some unfortunate \nmayor is going to have to figure out what to do about the property tax \nto pay for the schools and whether to raise the tax on food if you \ncan't raise it on telephones. And even though he or she might want to \nlower taxes, if we give a big break to one industry, if we give them \nlower taxes, it is going to be higher taxes at some tax level for \nsomebody else.\n  Whether it is hybrid cars or whether it is solving the obesity \nproblem by passing a Federal law that we can't tax low-carb foods, or \nsolving the energy problem by saying we can't have a State tax on solar \npanels on the roof--all those things sound good, but it is not our \nresponsibility in a Federal system to tell State and local governments \nwhat services they can provide and what taxes they can charge. And \nespecially that is true when already the Congress and the States are \nsubsidizing this industry.\n  I believe if Congress wants to give a big subsidy to the high-speed \nInternet access business, Congress ought to pay for it. The way to do \nit is to adopt the George W. Bush Texas proposal that was enacted in \n1999. That is relatively inexpensive. It benefits consumers. It would \nsay to everybody in the country, the first $25 you pay on high-speed \nInternet access every month is tax exempt. The States have asked us to \ndo it. Why don't we do it? Why do we insist on rushing through the \nCongress legislation that gives a big break to the industry that is \nalready, at least as far as my research shows, the most highly \nsubsidized and fastest growing new technology in America today?\n  The Department of Commerce and the Congressional Budget Office both \nhave advised us it is growing so fast it needs no subsidy, that there \nis no need to spend more taxpayer money on that.\n  I see the distinguished Senator from Delaware, former chairman of the \nNational Governors Association. He has been a leader in the fight to \nremind us we have a Federal system, and that it is not up to us to come \nup with big ideas, take credit for it, and send the bill to the local \ngovernments. I would like to yield to him whatever time he may require.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Tennessee for \nyielding the time. Let me say how much I enjoyed the opportunity to \nwork with the Senator on this issue and, frankly, on a number of other \nissues. I think he has shown a lot of courage, and I am grateful to \nhim. I thank him for the opportunity to be his partner.\n  I take some time this morning to address one of the important \narguments made by our colleagues on the other side of this debate. \nProponents of the legislation argue the only way to encourage broadband \ndeployment is to provide subsidies to telecommunication industries with \nno strings attached. Furthermore, they argue the only way to create \nsuch subsidies is to pass a large, new, unfunded Federal mandate. I \nsubmit if what all of us here want to do is determine the taxes and \nspending policies of our State governments, then we should do what \nSenator Alexander did, what Senator Voinovich did, what Senator \nHollings, I, and others did. We ran for Governor. We were elected. As a \nresult we had the opportunity--in my case for 8 years--to decide what \nthe taxing and spending policies of our States' governments should be. \nThat is what we did.\n  The authority we are granted here in the Senate by the Constitution \nis to decide the taxes and spending policies of the Federal Government, \nnot the taxing and spending policies of the State governments, and not \nthe spending and taxing policies of local governments. Our job is to \ndetermine the taxing and spending policies of the Federal Government.\n  That being said, it is not as if we the Senate are somehow without \nthe power to create incentives for industries to encourage certain \nactivities we deem to be desirable. Senator Alexander mentioned a \ncouple of areas where we are involved with tax policies in other cases \nand with spending policies to encourage the development of fuel cell \nvehicles, or to develop the creation of leaner burning diesel vehicles, \nor to incentivize creation of coal-fired plants that don't pollute a \ngreat deal. We have that spending and taxing authority, and we are \nusing it--some would argue not to great effect, but that is our \nresponsibility. We have the authority, after all, of a Federal budget. \nIt is over $2 trillion.\n  If we believe telecommunications companies need more money to build \nand market their broadband networks, and if we believe we can do better \nthan the private sector in providing that money, then there are any \nnumber of ways we can provide money at the Federal level. After we do \nthat, first of all,\n\n[[Page S4393]]\n\nwe could provide Federal grants. We can provide Federal tax breaks. We \ncan provide loan guarantees. We can provide additional spectrum for \nunlicensed use. The only reason not to provide the money in these ways, \nif it is needed, is because Congress would have to find a way to pay \nfor it rather than simply sending the bill to our friends in our State \nand local governments. If we pass a new unfunded mandate this week or \nnext week, it will be a matter of choice rather than a matter of \nnecessity.\n  In case anyone doubts that, I would like to bring to the attention of \nour colleagues here in the Senate a few of the many bills that have \nbeen introduced in the Congress to create Federal incentives for \nbroadband deployment. These bills have already been written. These \nbills have already been introduced. Many of them have a rather broad \ncosponsorship. If we wanted to, we could bring one or several of them \nto the floor today, debate them, and perhaps pass them.\n  I will mention a number of those bills. I want to start first with \nbills that have been introduced by Senators who have joined us in \nopposing the unfunded Federal mandate we are debating here today. I do \nso because there has been some suggestion made by our colleague on the \nother side of this issue that those of us who oppose unfunded mandates \nalso oppose the Internet, or oppose efforts to encourage the \ndevelopment of broadband. That is not true. While I doubt many of our \ncolleagues believe this to be the case, I do believe it is important we \nclarify matters for the record.\n\n  Let me start with a bill authored by Senator Hollings, a \ndistinguished ranking member of the Commerce Committee. One year ago, \nSenator Hollings introduced the Broadband Deployment Act. It is a true \nFederal broadband bill, and as such it would be a much more appropriate \npiece of legislation for us to be debating here today. Instead of \nhanding State and local governments an unfunded mandate, Senator \nHollings' bill would provide broadband to support State and local \nbroadband initiatives. Rather than being unfunded, Senator Hollings' \nproposal would be financed by moneys from the Federal telephone access \ntax.\n  Besides block grants, Senator Hollings' bill would also provide \ndirect grants for broadband deployment. It would also support \nuniversity research on next-generation broadband technology and pilot \nprojects deploying new wireless broadband technology. I think that \nsounds like a worthwhile proposal.\n  However, for Senators who are opposed to providing outright grants, \nperhaps we should consider another proposal; that is, one by Senator \nDorgan.\n  His proposal is to make low-interest loans available to companies \nthat are deploying broadband technologies in rural areas such as North \nDakota. We have rural areas in Kentucky. There are rural areas in \nTennessee. Believe it or not, we still have rural areas in Delaware. \nThat proposal might be of some interest to a lot of us, and I suspect \nto other of our colleagues.\n  On the other hand, if Senators would rather provide tax incentives \nand either grants or loans, then perhaps we should be debating Senator \nRockefeller's Broadband Internet Access Act. Senator Rockefeller's \nlegislation would provide tax credits for companies investing in \nbroadband equipment. It would provide a 10-percent tax credit for \ninvestments in so-called ``current generation'' broadband services.\n  For investment in higher speeds for next-generation broadband \nservices, his bill would provide a 20-percent tax credit.\n  If it is a Republican tax proposal my colleagues are looking for, we \ncould always turn to Montana and Senator Burns' proposal to allow the \nexpensing of broadband investments by companies. That might work. I \nfind that attractive.\n  If party affiliation is not the hangup, but Senators are \nuncomfortable with providing tax incentives directly to companies, \nperhaps they would prefer the approach suggested by our colleague from \nNew York, Senator Clinton. She proposes a different approach. She \nproposes providing an income tax credit to holders of bonds that are \nused to finance the deployment of broadband technology.\n  Finally, if Senators don't want to provide grants, loans, or tax \nincentives, they can consider an approach advocated by one of our \ncolleagues who happens to represent, among other places in California, \nSilicon Valley; that is, Senator Boxer. Senator Boxer has proposed we \nallocate additional spectrum for unlicensed use by wireless broadband \ndevices.\n  Those are only a few of the proposals that have been made, \nintroduced, discussed, and in some cases subject to hearings, and which \nhave cosponsors.\n  Those are a sampling of the things we can do as Federal legislators \nin a proactive way if we are interested in strengthening the ability of \ncompanies to market and extend their broadband systems.\n  What I think this array of proposals indicates is there is no limit \nto the ways in which we could act, if we wanted to, to encourage \nbroadband deployment at the Federal level. The Senators I have \nmentioned--I mentioned five of them--span the ideological spectrum, \nfrom liberal to conservative. They come from different parts of our \ncountry. Their proposals reflect their ideological diversity. Some \nwould increase spending; others would cut taxes. Some would finance \ntheir proposals by reallocating existing resources; others would add to \nthe deficit.\n  But what is clear is all these proposals are harder to pass here in \nWashington than an unfunded mandate because we would have to pay the \nbill ourselves. We could not stick anyone else with the tab. We would \nhave to pay the tab.\n  Admittedly, at a time when our Federal budget deficit is out of \ncontrol, I have to confess passing the buck does have a certain amount \nof appeal. But it is not as though State and local governments are in \nmuch better shape financially than we are. State and local governments \nare struggling to cope with the worst financial crisis they have faced, \nI am told, since World War II. Classrooms are becoming overcrowded as \nschool budgets are cut. Prisoners are being released from jails as \ncorrection budgets are cut. Governors and mayors are pushing through \nunpopular and frequently regressive tax increases.\n  New industry subsidies can be created for all sorts of wonderful \npurposes, but if they are conceived in Washington, and then the cost of \nthose subsidies is passed on to State and local governments, what it \nall amounts to is political welfare. We spend, they pay.\n  If we are going to pass on our costs to our friends in State and \nlocal governments, we ought to at the very least have the courtesy to \ntell them how much expense we are planning to run up on their tab. \nPerhaps the worst part about this new unfunded Federal mandate we are \nproposing is we cannot honestly look our Governors in the eye, we \ncannot honestly look our mayors in the eye, we cannot honestly look our \nState legislators in the eye, and even tell them how much this unfunded \nmandate is going to cost them and their State or their city or their \ncounty. We cannot do that because, in truth, we have no idea.\n  I would ask how my colleagues would react to the following proposal \nfrom me: Suppose I proposed a bill to create new Federal subsidies for \nthe poultry industry.\n  The poultry industry is big in our State and the entire Delmarva \nPeninsula. In fact, for every person living in Delaware, there are 300 \nchickens. Let's say I proposed a bill to create new Federal subsidies \nfor the poultry industry, or any industry, for that matter. Suppose \nthese subsidies would be provided in the form of mandatory spending \noutside the control of annual appropriations. Suppose CBO evaluated my \nproposal and indicated they could not estimate, they could not even \nguess how much my proposal would cost, except to say: We believe it \ncould grow to be large. We believe it could grow to be large.\n  That is what CBO has said about S. 150: We believe its cost to State \nand local governments could grow to be large. But they are unable to \nsay how large and how soon.\n  If I proposed some kind of proposal that helped our poultry industry, \nand CBO said, ``We don't know how much this is going to cost,'' would \nmy colleagues in the Senate pass that kind of a proposal? Would they \neven allow it to be considered on the floor of the Senate? As \nconvincing as I might be, I do\n\n[[Page S4394]]\n\nnot think they would. Yet this is exactly what we are asking our \nGovernors to accept from us. This is why the Governors united--\nRepublican and Democrat alike--in opposing the subsidies in the \nunderlying bill we are debating today.\n  If my colleagues have not yet read CBO's analysis of this bill, I \nurge they do so. The Congressional Budget Office tells us this \nlegislation is written in a way that is so broad and so vague they \ncannot even give us a rough estimate of what its effect will be on \nState and local governments, except to say: We expect it to grow to be \nlarge. They say the language in this legislation is so confusing that \nlawyers will ultimately have to get involved, and we will not know what \nthe implications for State and local budgets will be until it all gets \nsorted out in the courts.\n  My friends, that is unacceptable. It is beneath us as the world's \ngreatest deliberative body. It is an abdication of our responsibility \nas the body our Founders created in part to protect the interests of \nthe respective States of our Union.\n  We can do better. We all agree the current moratorium on Internet \naccess taxes should be extended. I say ``the current moratorium.'' It \nis a moratorium that was in place for 5 years and expired last \nNovember. But we agree the moratorium should be restored. We disagree, \nthough, on what should be done beyond that. But we all agree the \nmoratorium should be extended.\n  If we are going to write this bill on the floor rather than \nnegotiating a compromise everyone can live with, we ought to begin with \nwhat we can all agree on, and debate what to do beyond that. We ought \nto call up a bill that simply extends the old moratorium.\n  I want to expand that moratorium to make it technology neutral. Along \nwith Senator Alexander, I expect to offer an amendment to do that. If \nothers want to add billions in new subsidies to the bill on top of \nthat, then they can offer their own amendments. If we want to propose \nways to pay for such subsidies, as others may propose, and to do so \nhere at the Federal level rather than passing the bill to the States, \nthen we should put our proposals forward. If others want to propose \ndifferent inducements to industries, such as low-interest loans or \nallocations of spectrum, then they should bring those proposals forward \nas well.\n  That seems, to me at least, to be the fairest way to proceed. If the \ngoal is to have a genuine debate on this issue and to let the Senate \nwork its will, we would welcome that. On the other hand, if the \nintention is to proceed to a fundamentally flawed bill, and then \nimmediately file cloture to close off debate, we have no choice but to \nuse every procedure available to us to protect our rights and to \nprotect the interests of our States.\n  My hope is we will still be able to work this one out and reach an \nacceptable compromise, one that extends the moratorium and makes it \nneutral with respect to technology, but also one that first does no \nharm to State and local governments, that are struggling to cope, as I \nsaid earlier, with their worst financial crisis since World War II.\n  In 1995, when the Senate debated and, along with the House of \nRepresentatives, passed the unfunded mandates law, I was not working in \nthe Senate. I had been a Member of the House of Representatives, but I \nleft at the end of 1992. Former Governor Mike Castle and I sort of \nswapped jobs. He became a Congressman from Delaware, and I was \nprivileged to become its Governor.\n  Starting in 1993, my first year as Governor, I began working with \nother Governors, including Senator Voinovich. What we sought to do was \nto work actually initially with a bunch of Republicans who were part of \nthe so-called ``Gingrich Revolution'' which was able to capture the \nmajorities in the House and Senate in 1994. One of the platforms of the \n``Gingrich Revolution'' was the Federal Government should not tell the \nState and local governments what to spend their money on, and then not \nprovide that money; nor should the Federal Government tell State and \nlocal governments what they could or could not tax without providing \nsome offset if we cut their revenue base.\n  One of the first laws enacted in the year 1995, signed by then-\nPresident Clinton, is one that said: Unfunded mandates are wrong, \nwhether they are on the spending side or on the revenue side.\n  In 1998, the Congress passed an unfunded mandate, not a big one but a \nlittle bitty one. The reason they did it, they said, was to make sure \nthe Internet has an opportunity to get up on its feet and successful \nbecause we think it could mean good things for our economy. It has.\n  At a time when State and local governments were beginning to put \ntaxes or fees in place on access to the Internet, the Congress and \nPresident Clinton said: State and local governments, if you are already \nimposing some kind of tax on access to the Internet or some fees on \naccess to the Internet, essentially your AOL bills of consumers, if you \nalready have one in place, you may keep it in place, but if you haven't \ndone it, you are not going to be able to do so. So a moratorium was put \nin place in 1998. Most people thought it was a good idea. States went \nalong with it. They were not crazy about the idea, but they went along \nwith it.\n  After 3 years the moratorium was supposed to expire. When it was \nabout to expire, it was extended, almost by acclamation, in 2001. The \nStates were not crazy about the idea, but there was not a whole lot of \npush back. Then late last year, that 2-year extension expired.\n  With Senators Alexander, Voinovich, Graham of Florida, Feinstein, \nDorgan, Enzi, Hollings and I, and others opposing the underlying bill, \nI don't believe you would see that kind of opposition if some things \nwere different.\n  If there had never been an unfunded mandates law in 1995, we may not \nfeel so strongly, although the idea that the Federal Government is \ntelling the States what to do and to pay for it, the Federal Government \nis taking away the revenue base of the States and not making up the \ndifference, that still rubs me the wrong way. I find it galling. But if \nthere were no unfunded mandates law, we would probably not be making \nthis kind of fuss today over this issue.\n  If the Internet were still in its infancy, still struggling to hit \nits stride, not yet making the impact it does today in our economy here \nand around the world, we probably wouldn't be making the fuss we are \ntoday in opposition to the underlying bill.\n  If States today were awash in money and not facing the largest fiscal \ncrisis they have faced in over 50 years, we probably would not be \nmaking the kind of noise we are in opposition to the underlying bill.\n  If telecom companies were not beginning to enjoy very decent profits \nas they are today--and the prospect is for more of the same--then we \nmight not be making the kind of fuss we are in opposition to the \nunderlying bill.\n  As it turns out, there is an unfunded mandate law, and even if there \nwere not, what we are seeking to do in my judgment is morally wrong. \nThe Internet is no longer in its infancy. It is a grown child, not just \ntrying to walk or crawl. This grown child is running at full speed. The \nStates are not awash in money. They are hurting. They are hurting in \nways we have not seen in a long time.\n  It is not just the classrooms that are crowded. It is not just the \nprison doors being opened to let people out who frankly should still be \nincarcerated in many cases. It is not just the caseload burdens of \nfolks whose job it is to work with families in trouble. All of those \nproblems are facing State and local governments, and they do not have \nthe revenues to cope with them in many cases.\n  The telecoms are doing pretty well these days. They went through a \ntough patch, but they seem to be coming through it.\n  I don't know if Senator Alexander still has to go somewhere or not. \nIs he able to stay on the floor a bit longer?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I am going to leave within 4 or 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CARPER. Let me yield before the Senator leaves, if he would like \nto make some comments. I have a few more things I would like to say.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I have been listening to the Senator from Delaware \ncarefully.\n  Mr. CARPER. You have heard some of this before.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. What was going through my mind was: I don't recall a\n\n[[Page S4395]]\n\ntime when I was Governor of Tennessee that I ever saw the Congress do \nanything like this. There were unfunded Federal mandates that we didn't \nlike. Back in the early 1970s, before I was Governor, Congress said: We \nought to help children with disabilities. We will pay for a certain \npercentage of it, but they never did. I hear about that all the time \nfrom local school boards and local people. But I cannot remember a time \nwhen the Congress passed a law saying: We have come up with a great \nidea here, and we are going to give a State tax break to somebody to \npay for it. I think we would have laughed about that.\n  Then we would have gotten really mad about it. It is so farfetched.\n  We are having a very serious debate about this in the Congress. \nEverybody is going through the motions, making bills doing all these \nthings. But what we are doing is, U.S. Senators are passing State laws. \nThat is what we are doing.\n  If I had known that I could have run for the Senate in 2002, I could \nhave probably been elected by a big margin in Tennessee. I could have \nsaid: When I get to Washington, I am going to pass a Federal law \nabolishing the State income tax, in case you ever pass it, making it \nillegal for Tennessee to pass a State income tax. We don't have one and \npeople don't want one, although they may get one, if this bill passes. \nOr I could say, as we have said a little earlier, hybrid cars are a \ngreat invention. I think I will pass a Federal law telling Tennessee, \nKentucky, and Delaware they can't tax cars. Car taxes are hated. Or \nobesity is a national problem. I think I will pass a Federal law \nsaying: No sales taxes on low-carb or low-fat food.\n  Housing is important to all of us in the United States and in the \nSenate, but we don't pass a Federal law lowering local property taxes \nin Louisville or Nashville or Wilmington in order to encourage housing. \nWhy don't we do that? It is because we have a Federal system. We are \nnot Belgium. We are not France. We have Governors. We have mayors. This \nis America. It is a part of the American character that we like to make \nour decisions at home.\n  When I go to a Lincoln Day dinner--I don't go to the Democratic \nmeetings--I always say something about local control. If I were to go \nto any Republican meeting in Tennessee and say, I especially don't like \nit when a Congressman gets up and passes a Federal law and takes credit \nfor the idea and sends the bill to the Governor or the mayor, I would \nget a big round of applause for that because we believe that in the \nRepublican Party in Tennessee, and most Tennesseans do as well.\n  I was enjoying the remarks of the Senator, and that was going through \nmy mind. I wish I could think of some way to convey to my colleagues \nthat we are talking out of the box here. We are not talking about \nFederal taxes, Federal subsidies, or Federal programs; we are talking \nabout State programs. That is what we are doing here. It is totally \ninappropriate, against the spirit of the tenth amendment and Ronald \nReagan and everything else we stood for on the Republican side in the \nContract with America. It is offensive to that spirit. That is why I am \nhere today.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, it is ironic. The Senator talks about some \nof us here who would like to almost usurp the responsibilities of our \nState and local officials.\n  I always describe myself, when people ask what I do, as a \n``recovering Governor.'' Although I love being in the Senate and \nworking with particularly the folks we are engaged with on this \nparticular issue, we are not Governors, we are not mayors, we are not \ncounty executives, and we are not State legislators; we are Federal \nlegislators. We have the ability, the power, through the Federal purse, \nthrough our appropriations process, to offer grants and provide tax \ncredits. We are in a position to nurture industries, promote them. We \nhave talked about some of them today. This is one industry that should \nbe nurtured and strengthened. We can do that and we should do that on \nour dime.\n  I see the Senator from New Hampshire on his feet. I will make one \nmore comment and then I will yield the floor.\n  Senators Alexander, Voinovich, and I just returned from a press \nconference upstairs a couple minutes ago. We were asked about the \nproposal Senator McCain has offered. I have a huge respect for him. We \nwere colleagues in the House together, and we served in the Navy at \nabout the same time. I believe what he submitted is a proposal made in \ngood faith. However, I also ask my colleagues to keep this in mind. \nWhether you look at the underlying bill, S. 150, considering the \nalternative Senator Alexander and I offered, also on behalf of other \ncolleagues, and consider what Senator McCain offered and other \nproposals that may come to the floor, there are really four areas of \ncontention. They include, No. 1, and maybe most important, what is the \ndefinition of what is tax exempt under the moratorium? I will say that \nagain. The first area of contention may be the most important. It is \nthe definition of what is tax exempt under whatever moratorium is being \nproposed.\n  Other areas of contention, though I think not as important, include \nthe duration of the moratorium. Should it be 15 months, 2 years, 3 \nyears, or 4 years? That is an area of contention. But it is not as \ncritical as the definition of what is tax exempt under whatever \nmoratorium is being proposed.\n  The third area of contention is, what is the duration of the \ngrandfather clauses for State and local governments which would be \ndeprived of revenue that they currently collect?\n  Finally, what is the application of the moratorium to traditional \ntaxable voice communications, when those communications are routed over \nthe Internet? Those are really the four areas of contention.\n  If you look carefully at the proposal submitted by Senator McCain, \nthe definition of what is tax exempt under his proposal looks a whole \nlot like that which is included in the bill authored by Senators Allen \nand Wyden. While the duration of the moratorium is a little different, \nit is shorter. That, in my judgment, is not really the key factor here. \nOf interest, though, is the duration of the grandfather clause. I think \nthe moratorium under the McCain proposal is 4 years, but the \ngrandfather clause protecting State and local governments is only for 3 \nyears. There appears to be, superficially, an effort in the McCain bill \nto address the issue of the application of the moratorium to \ntraditional taxable voice communications when those forms of \ncommunications are routed over the Internet. On the one hand, the \nlegislation appears to address, with some sensitivity, that concern. \nBut on the other hand, it takes it back. We have to look at the entire \nlanguage as it pertains to this provision.\n  These are not easy issues to understand. I have spent a fair amount \nof time on them and they are not easy for me. For those of us not on \nthe Commerce Committee and have not had the benefit of the extensive \nhearings, these are not easy issues. I have tried to come up to speed \non these issues, and the rest of us in this body have struggled to come \nup to speed. I want to make sure we use the time before us this week, \nand maybe next week, to provide the kind of primer that I have been \nprivileged to have for others of our colleagues, so that at the end of \nthe day, when we vote, we are casting an informed vote.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be allowed to \nproceed for 5 minutes and that it not be charged to anyone's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I wanted to speak on this topic to address \na couple points that have been made. I appreciate the sincerity and the \ninterests of those who oppose this bill. They have opposed it \nvigorously and aggressively. But I believe very strongly, having seen \nthis debate unfold, that this is not a question of their support for an \nalternative as much as it is their opposition to any legislation that \nprotects the Internet from taxation.\n  I draw that conclusion because we are debating a motion to proceed. \nIf there was a genuine interest in bringing different alternatives to \nthe floor and having a vote on those alternatives or amendments, we \nwould not be in what is effectively a stonewalling scenario, delaying \ntactic, if you will, to\n\n[[Page S4396]]\n\nhave to force a cloture vote on simply proceeding to the bill. There \nare a handful of people who vehemently oppose any legislation that \nprotects the Internet from taxation. I think that is why this has taken \nso long to move forward.\n  Some people do not support the underlying legislation, and it is \ncertainly true that it would protect the Internet from taxation. But \nwhat it would not do is create special considerations for the Internet \nor broadband access. The legislation specifically says we will preempt, \nor prohibit, any discriminatory taxes, taxes that are specifically \naddressed to Internet service providers or broadband providers, but \nthose businesses are still subject to State property taxes, sales \ntaxes, capital gains taxes, and all of the other taxes that are levied \nbroadly and uniformly within a State.\n  Second, the suggestion was made that we are writing State law here, \nand that is simply wrong. This is an item and an interest and issue of \ninterstate commerce. Just as the Federal Government exercises its \nprerogative to clarify legislation with regard to other interstate \ncommerce activities, such as shipping, trucking, railroads, or \naviation, the national and global Internet broadband communication \nsystem that has been established by entrepreneurs over the past 15 \nyears ought to, at some level, be protected from multiple and \ndiscriminatory regulations and taxation because of its importance to \ninterstate commerce.\n  We are writing Federal law here, not State law. I think it is a \nlittle bit disingenuous to suggest we are writing State law and to \nraise concerns about us writing State law, when in fact, when this bill \nis dispensed with--and I hope passed and signed into law--the very \nopponents of this bill who said they are worried about us writing State \nlaw will come right back to the floor of this Senate and support \nlegislation to authorize States to collect taxes from businesses that \ndo not reside or have facilities or domiciles in those States.\n  Many opponents of this bill also want the Federal Government to \nauthorize the collection of taxation from businesses outside of their \nStates, which is not only an intervention in States' rights or State \nlaws, but it is effectively an authorization of taxation without \nrepresentation because the residents of those States will then have to \nremit taxes to other States in which they do not have a voice.\n  We will have that debate and discussion. Some will support that \nprocess; some will oppose that process. But the very opponents of this \nbill who raise the concern about writing State law will come back and \nask for that very power to be authorized and approved by the Congress \nbecause only Congress can give States that power.\n  I think there is a little bit of a mixed message here looking for an \nargument that might seem to be useful in stopping or thwarting this \nbill, but it is an unfair argument and an improper argument.\n  Some people think that cities, counties, and States should have the \nright and the ability to tax the Internet. They want those cities and \nStates to tax the Internet. I do not think that is right for consumers, \nit is not right for America, it is not right for investment, and it is \nnot right for broadband access or deployment. If they want to take the \nfloor and say, We don't support Internet taxes, we are looking out for \nthe interest of these cities and States, I say think again because the \nwhole reason they are raising the issue of the unfunded mandate and \nsupporting a point of order against this bill because of the so-called \nunfunded mandate is precisely because of those States that are \ncollecting the tax today.\n  If you support striking this bill on the unfunded mandate, then you \nare effectively standing up for those States, cities, towns, and \ncounties that are taxing the Internet today. That should not be allowed \nto continue. It is not good for our economy, and it is certainly not \nthe right incentive to create if we want to ensure broadband reaches \nthroughout the country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the \nSenate resumes debate on the motion to proceed at 2:15 p.m., the debate \ntime be allocated as follows: 20 minutes to Senator Alexander, 20 \nminutes to Senator Dorgan, 20 minutes to Senator McCain. I further ask \nunanimous consent that the Senate now recess until 2:15 p.m., subject \nto the previous order.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, what this \ndoes for Members and staff, so they fully understand, is this adds 20 \nminutes to the debate. That is all it does. I ask my friend modify his \nunanimous consent request to allow me to speak as in morning business, \nand following my remarks, we will go into our normal Tuesday recess.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I have no objection to that request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Nevada.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/27/senate-section/article/S4396-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4396]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 MILITARY RECORD OF SENATOR JOHN KERRY\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I had the good fortune a week ago this past \nSaturday to be in Las Vegas. At that time, I spoke about the military \nrecord of Senator John Kerry. In fact, I not only spoke about the \nmilitary record of John Kerry, but I read verbatim from the two \ncitations for heroism he received.\n  The first citation for heroism he received was presented to him by \nAdmiral Zumwalt. In that citation, it talked about what Senator Kerry \ndid to earn the Silver Star. In effect, what he did is as follows:\n  Senator Kerry was the commander of a swift boat. A swift boat was a \nboat that would move very quickly, and they used it in the rivers of \nSoutheast Asia. They were subject to ambushes and attacks, especially \nbefore there was something done to make sure the shoreline was free of \nfoliage. They were attacked often.\n  In this instance, a rocket hit his swift boat, blew all the windows \nout of it, and, of course, injured people on board the boat. Senator \nKerry at that time directed the swift boat to, rather than go away from \nthe battle, go into the battle and go to shore. As soon as he got close \nenough to the shore to get off the boat, he got off the boat, and \nbefore the enemy had time to fire the second rocket, they were killed \nby Senator John Kerry. This is the reason he was given his first Silver \nStar.\n  The Bronze Star was awarded when again his boat was hit from shore. \nOne crewman was blown off the craft in the water. They were taking fire \nat this time. Senator Kerry, even though he was injured--his right arm \nwas bleeding badly--directed fire toward the enemy, got the swift boat \nclose enough to the man in the water, and he personally pulled the man \nout of the water.\n  These are, in synopsis, the two acts of heroism for which Senator \nKerry was decorated. He was decorated with the Silver Star and the \nBronze Star. He was, of course, also given three Purple Hearts. Purple \nHearts are given when someone is injured in battle.\n  There is no question that what John Kerry did in Southeast Asia, \nspecifically in Vietnam, was heroic. That is why he was given these \nmedals. I think it is outrageous for people to criticize his military \nservice to our country.\n  It is obvious this administration knows America loves a war hero, and \nJohn Kerry is a war hero. So what does the administration do? They do \neverything they can to denigrate this fine man rather than talk about \npolicy in Iraq, tax policy, environmental policy, economic policy, and \nhealth care policy. I think it is wrong that they are doing this, and I \nthink they should get back to talking about the issues that are \nimportant.\n  America knows John Kerry is a war hero.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID.

I ask unanimous consent that the time be charged equally \nagainst the three who will control time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 18\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield myself 4 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I have here in my hand a document prepared by the \nNational Governors Association that expresses support for extending the \nFederal ban on State and local taxation of Internet access, so long as \nthe moratorium respects three principles. One: Do no harm to State and \nlocal revenues. Two: Be clear about what services are covered by the \nmoratorium to ensure that voice services and other services that use \nthe Internet are excluded from the scope of the moratorium. Three: Stay \nflexible by extending the moratorium temporarily. These are the same \nprinciples that Senator Alexander and others have stated they want to \nrespect.\n  I agree with these principles, which is why I will offer today a \ncompromise amendment to S. 150, the Internet Tax Non-discrimination \nAct.\n  The amendment would ensure that a significant portion--in fact, an \noverwhelming portion--of State and local telecommunications services \ntax revenues would remain protected. This means that almost $20 billion \nof revenue would not be impacted by the proposal that I support. I \nwould contrast this with the $18 billion that the NGA claims the \nversion of S. 150 that passed in the House last year would cost State \nand local governments, and the almost $12 billion that the association \nclaims S. 150 would take away from States and localities.\n  I respectfully submit that the relatively small impact that the \ncompromise amendment would have on States and local revenues would stem \nprimarily from our wish to treat all States equally under this \nmoratorium. Still, to accommodate the States that were taxing the \nInternet in 1998 when the moratorium was first enacted, the amendment \nwould propose to give those States 3 more years of Internet access tax \nrevenues. The compromise amendment would even permit those States that \nwere not originally grandfathered but that nevertheless have begun \ntaxing Internet access 2 years of additional revenue.\n  The NGA has also asked for clarity in the definition of Internet \naccess. I agree that there should be clarity in this matter. To that \nend, the compromise amendment provides as plainly as possible that it \nwould not prohibit States and localities from taxing traditional \ntelephone services, voice services that use the Internet, and other \nservices that use the Internet. The amendment also makes clear that e-\nmail could not be taxed by the compromise amendment. Once again, I have \nrespected another core principle of the NGA in the matter.\n  And finally, the NGA seeks a temporary, rather than a permanent \nextension of the moratorium under the premise that, as the association \nand Senator Alexander say ``A temporary solution is better than \npermanent confusion.'' The compromise amendment would extend the \nmoratorium for a period of 4 years from November 1, 2003. Simply put, \nanything shorter would put us back on this floor debating this measure \nright after it is signed by the President.\n  So I remind my colleagues: What I will offer today does very clearly \naddress the concerns raised by the NGA and other State and local \ngroups. I hope, therefore, that my colleagues will support me in \npassing this reasonable compromise.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arizona for \nhis courtesy, his hard work, and his meetings on a complex issue, about \nwhich there are differences of opinion. People might wonder why are we \nhaving a hard time agreeing. One of the reasons is we have a difference \nof opinion, which I will talk about in a minute. A second is that \nsometimes even when we agree, when we sit down and try to write down \nwhat we agree on, we then disagree.\n  I am not sure if that is because we don't agree, or because our \nstaffs have missed the boat, or because we Senators are not as wise as \nwe should be. But let me be responsive to Senator McCain, because he \nhas come to the table with a specific proposal. I appreciate that. We \ngot that yesterday afternoon and we read it carefully last night, and I \nsent him a letter which he got just a little while ago. I tried to say \nto him my thanks for it. I identified four areas which are the \nprinciples he just talked about that I see as concerns and four ways to \nfix the problems.\n  He then asked me if I would be willing to offer an amendment to fix \nthe problems, and I am preparing such an amendment to do that. But \nmaybe we can speed that up. Let me go through the points he made and \nsay where I have concern.\n  The first problem with the most recent McCain proposal is the \ndefinition. The definition is basically the same definition as in the \nlast proposal, which is the Allen-Wyden bill. It does not simply extend \nthe moratorium on State and local taxes on Internet access; it broadens \nthe definition to include business taxes State and local governments \ncollect, and those business taxes amount to a half billion dollars a \nyear. That is the first problem.\n  How would we fix it? We would fix it by adopting the narrower \ndefinition of the Alexander-Carper amendment which was introduced 6 \nmonths ago with 11 bipartisan sponsors, or we could go to the original \ndefinition that was in the 1998 moratorium.\n  Let's remember what we are talking about here. Everybody is saying we \nhave had a moratorium since 1998 that says, let's not allow State and \nlocal governments to tax Internet access. Certainly access is a very \nlittle thing. It was just the connection between you and AOL at the \ntime it was passed. Now it is the connection between you and a variety \nof people--maybe the connection between you and your telephone company \nproviding high-speed Internet access, your cable company providing \nhigh-speed Internet access, or it may be between you and DIRECTV \nproviding high-speed Internet access, or in Manassas, VA, they provide \nit to you by the electric company. So it is just you and your provider.\n  The problem with this definition--it is the same problem with the \ndefinition of the distinguished Senator from Virginia--is that it \nbroadens that, not to include just the end user and the provider, but \nthe business taxes, the whole process. It would be as if we were to \nsay, OK, we want to pass a Federal law saying in Virginia and Arizona \nand Tennessee you can't tax hybrid cars. You can't collect State taxes \non hybrid cars because that will help clean the air. We will pass a \nFederal law: No State tax. But not just the sales tax on the hybrid \ncar, also on the sales taxes that might apply to the supplier tier 1, \nsupplier tier 2, supplier tier 3, and all the way back to the supplier \nof steel for the raw material.\n  That is the first problem. It is the same old definition, and that is \nthe biggest problem. The fix would be just, if all we are doing is \nextending the 1998\n\n[[Page S4398]]\n\nmoratorium another 4 years so Congress can work on this \ncomprehensively, why don't we use that definition? That would be No. 1.\n  No. 2, Senator McCain says and Senator Allen said in a debate we had \nat Heritage--and if I am misrepresenting their point of view, I hope \nthey will correct me--that it was not the intent of their legislation \nto stop States from taxing telephone services, including telephone \ncalls made over the Internet. It was not their intention to preclude \nState and local governments from taxing telephone services including \ntelephone calls made over the Internet.\n  I would respectfully submit if that is their intention, the newest \nMcCain proposal does not do that. Perhaps, if he doesn't intend to do \nthat, our staffs could meet and we could work that out, or I could \noffer an amendment to try to fix it. If I were offering an amendment, \nit would simply say: Nothing in this act would preclude State and local \ngovernments from taxing telephone services, including telephone calls \nmade over the Internet.\n  That is the second issue. That is a big issue because certain local \ngovernments collect $18 billion a year in State and local taxes. We may \nnot like that but that is what they do. They choose to do that in \nTennessee and Texas instead of imposing a State income tax. They prefer \nto do that instead of putting a higher tax on food. That is their \ndecision. I don't think we intend by this bill which purports to just \nextend the Internet access moratorium to decide the huge question of \nwhether State and local governments should be permitted to tax \ntelephone calls. Senator Sununu has a bill on the subject. He has done \nthat in the normal order, and it will be considered by the Commerce \nCommittee of which Senator McCain is chairman. That is the place for \nthat. That is No. 2. Maybe that is just a misunderstanding. If we both \nwant the same thing, we ought to be able to write that down. Senator \nAllen and I have trouble in doing that.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I would like to finish with the other points, and then \nof course I will.\n  The other two points are on duration. Four years is better than \npermanent, and I thank the Senator for that. But 4 years is a long \ntime. We don't need more than 15 months or 2 years for the Commerce \nCommittee and the Congress to look at this in a comprehensive way.\n  What I am afraid of is once we make a fix here it will never get out \nof the law. And if we get the wrong definition in here, or if somehow I \nam right but I am defeated and the result is that we really do ban \nState and local governments from collecting taxes on telephone \nservices, then we will have driven a hole through State and local \nbudgets that we didn't intend.\n  Finally, on the grandfather clauses, I think they should all end at \nthe same time the moratorium ends, whenever that ends.\n  Those are four points, and that is not many points. If they were all \nfixed, I could go for the bill, and maybe some other people could as \nwell.\n  Let me conclude with this, and I will be glad to yield to someone \nelse, including Senator Wyden.\n  The reason I am on the floor has nothing to do at all with the \nInternet. It has everything to do with my view of federalism. I do not \nthink we should be passing laws that cost money and send the bill to \nState and local governments. I think we promised not to do that.\n  The way I read Senator McCain's proposal is it costs at least $\\1/2\\ \nbillion a year to State and local governments with his view of the \ndefinition. If the telephone language isn't fixed, it is $3 billion to \n$10 billion a year, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The \ngrandfather clauses which exist at least in 27 States today where they \nare collecting taxes on Internet access are $200 million or $300 \nmillion a year. Those are significant dollars.\n  I wish I could find a more effective way to say this. If we want to \ngive another subsidy to high-speed Internet access, which is the most \nrapidly growing technology in America, according to the New York Times \nof last week, and which has $4 billion in Federal subsidies and \nsubsidies from every State, if we want to give one more subsidy to this \nbusiness, then why don't we pay for it? Why don't we pay for it instead \nof sending the bill to local governments? I am afraid this compromise \ndoesn't do that.\n  I have mentioned this several times. I would like to mention it \nagain. I am preparing an amendment on this. President Bush's plan in \n1999 when he was Governor of Texas exempted the first $25 that you pay \non high-speed Internet access. It was exempted from taxation in Texas. \nThat might cost you $1 to $3 a month. That is what we are talking \nabout.\n  Everybody in Manassas, VA, can get high-speed Internet access for $25 \nfrom their electric company.\n  The Governors, State and local governments asked us to pass the Texas \nplan--to pass the Bush plan. But we are insisting on passing another \nplan that doesn't benefit the consumers. It benefits the most highly \nsubsidized technology company that I can find, if we have time--and we \nwill have time later--I have a book called ``The Nation of Laboratory \nBroadband Policy Experiences in the States.'' It details all of the \nwonderful State and local subsidies that are now being granted in \naddition to the $4 billion.\n  Put the subsidies aside. My major concern is if we want to impose a \ncost on State and local governments, we should not break our promise of \n1995, which was: No money, no mandate. If we break our promise, throw \nus out.\n  I am afraid that the McCain substitute breaks the promise. I would \nlike to work with Senator McCain to resolve those last four \ndifferences. I look forward to the opportunity of joining with him, \nSenator Allen, and Senator Wyden in coming to a result quickly this \nweek.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Yes.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I appreciate the Senator yielding. He has been very \ngracious.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I yield on the Senator's time.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nOregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I want to ask the Senator a question \nbecause I have the sense that the Senator from Tennessee thinks we \nought to just use the 1998 definition of Internet access. Is that \ncorrect? Is that what the Senator from Tennessee is saying?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator for his question. I suggest that \nthe 1998 definition is a better definition than the one in the latest \nMcCain proposal. The best definition is in the Alexander-Carper \ncompromise in December, but in the interest of trying to get to a \nresult, I could vote for either one of those two definitions.\n  Mr. WYDEN. What concerns me is that both the 1998 definition and the \nproposal of the Senator from Tennessee essentially discriminates \nagainst the future because the future is about broadband, particularly \nfor rural areas, for job creation, and highly skilled jobs. If you use \nthe 1998 definition, or essentially the Senator's proposal for just \nInternet access--I emphasis that is all we are talking about, Internet \naccess--what you will have is a situation where folks could get \nInternet access through cable and those folks end up essentially \ngetting a free ride. But if you get the Internet access and future DSL, \nyou are going to get taxed.\n  That is why Senator McCain and I and others would like to essentially \ncontinue the 7-year path we have had which is to promote technological \nneutrality--not to advantage one technology against another.\n  On the question of Internet access, which is what the President \ntalked about yesterday where he said he doesn't want to see Internet \naccess get taxed, that is what is in the McCain proposal. That is what \nI was trying to do. Unfortunately, that is not in the Senator's \nproposal or in the 1998 definition.\n  What will happen is this country will have the technology policy that \ndiscriminates against the future and discriminates against the field in \nwhich it is going to create highly skilled jobs.\n  By the way, cable isn't going to be serving those rural areas. It is \ngoing to be broadband and DSL which serves them.\n  I very much appreciate the Senator from Arizona yielding me this \ntime. We have clarified an important concept. Both in the 1998 \ndefinition that the Senator from Tennessee said he would\n\n[[Page S4399]]\n\nbe for or his compromise, in my view, would have the Senate taking a \nposition with respect to the future of the Internet and with respect to \nthe future of technology that would not be in the public interest.\n  I thank my colleague from Arizona for yielding me the time.\n  I wrap up by way of saying I am going to continue to work with the \nSenator from Tennessee who has been very thoughtful and generous with \nhis time. We can find a common ground.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six and one-half minutes.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I wish to make two points to the \nSenator from Oregon who has worked hard on this legislation from the \nvery beginning. He is an original cosponsor.\n  No. 1, he is right about the 1998 definition. It isn't high-speed \nInternet access. There is a difference between the way high-speed \nInternet access offered over a telephone line and high-speed Internet \naccess offered over a cable is treated.\n  But there are two solutions to that. One is, the Ninth Circuit just \nsolved the problem--the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals--by treating \nthem the same. Now that is on appeal to the Supreme Court. So whatever \nwe do here might be changed by the courts. That is why we need a short \nmoratorium, so Senator McCain's committee and your committee can go \ninto a comprehensive look and solve this whole problem over the next 2 \nyears. We are ready to do that. The FCC is ready to do that.\n  The second answer is, the Alexander-Carper amendment endeavors to \ntreat all providers of high-speed Internet access the same. It is the \nbest we can do from here. If the courts and the FCC do something in \naddition to that, we cannot control it.\n  Finally, I am concerned about the digital divide, too. But if power \ncompanies are going to be offering high-speed Internet access in \nManassas, VA, which they do for $25 a month--thanks to the Rural \nElectrification Association, everybody is going to have high-speed \nInternet access available to them if they have an electric wire to \ntheir house. If they do not, DirecTV will sell it to them from the sky, \nor their telephone company will sell it to them, or their cable company \nwill sell it to them. Yet another way may be invented.\n  So I do not think we have any problem with encouraging high-speed \nInternet access. It is the fastest growing technology in America today. \nIt is the most heavily subsidized. They are giving it away in LaGrange, \nGA, and only about half the people will take it. It is coming. It is \navailable. But if we are going to give any kind of subsidy, let's pay \nfor it here. Let's not send the bill to State and local governments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nOregon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, again, I want to make it clear to the \nSenator from Tennessee, I am anxious to work with him. But what we have \nseen, essentially, in this iteration of the debate, is a dusting off of \nthe same arguments we have heard on the floor of the Senate in the \npast, that somehow this is going to result in extraordinary losses of \nrevenue.\n  For example, in 1997, we were told by a number of the organizations \nat the State and local level that this was going to produce massive \nlosses of revenue. In fact, the exact quote is: Our efforts, the \nefforts of Senator McCain and I, and others, in 1997, would lead to a \ncollapse of the State and local revenue system. The very next year, the \nyear after we passed our first moratorium on multiple and \ndiscriminatory Internet taxes, we saw revenue go up $7 billion. So we \nhave had essentially all of these dire projections, these calamitous \nprojections year after year--and I put them all in the Record--and they \nhave not come to pass.\n  The reason they have not come to pass is that nobody is talking about \nthe Internet getting a free ride. All we have said, from the very \nbeginning, is that under this legislation you have to treat the online \nworld like you treat the offline world.\n  When I came to the floor of the Senate with the distinguished \nchairman of the Commerce Committee on this more than 7 years ago--and \nfolks probably found this subject even more difficult then than they do \nnow; I know that is hard to believe--we said: Look, if you buy the \nnewspaper--essentially ``snail mail''--you are not paying any taxes, \nbut if you buy the newspaper in the interactive edition, you pay a tax.\n  That was discriminatory. All we have tried to do over the last 7 \nyears is essentially keep that principle in place and allow it to \nevolve with the technology. So for 7 years this has been about \ntechnology neutrality and dealing with these questions of State and \nlocal finance. The States have not lost money as a result of our making \nsure that you are not going to see multiple and discriminatory taxes on \nInternet access.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield myself 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I appreciate the letter from the Senator \nfrom Tennessee. My understanding is, he has four major concerns. I hope \nto work with him to resolve these concerns. If not, I hope we will see \namendments and let the Senate work its will as to whether those \nconcerns are valid in the view of a majority of the Senate. I look \nforward to seeing and debating and voting on these amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arizona and \nlook forward to doing that.\n  If I may continue the discussion for a moment with the Senator from \nOregon, the reason State and local governments did not lose much money \nin the last few years from the moratorium on State and local taxation \nis because, one, there was a very narrow definition--narrower than the \none this latest proposal and your proposal makes. You broaden the \ndefinition to include the whole Internet access backbone. You are not \njust talking about the connection between the end user and provider; \nyou are talking about this backbone. You are talking about the normal \nbusiness taxes that any other business would pay.\n  The other thing is, high-speed Internet access really had not arrived \n5 or 6 years ago. It has arrived today. It is the fastest-growing \ntechnology. If we make a mistake on the telephone section of this bill, \nwe will drive a Mack truck through State and local governments, and we \ncan rename this bill the ``Higher Local Property Tax'' bill of 2004 or \nthe ``State Income Tax Bill in Tennessee'' or the ``State Income Tax \nBill in Texas,'' because if you take away hundreds of millions of \ndollars from State and local governments--or billions of dollars \neventually--they have to look for another source of revenue. They may \ncut government some, but they will have to look for another source of \nrevenue. We should be neutral about it. Ronald Reagan, the Republican \nParty--we have stood on the notion that we would return more \nresponsibility, return more decisionmaking to local governments.\n  I urge my colleagues to look carefully at this legislation and vote \nfor something that does no harm to State and local governments, and \nvote for something that gives the Commerce Committee a short time to \nfigure this out properly, and vote for something that does not give an \nunnecessary benefit, unnecessary subsidy to what I judge to be already \nthe most heavily subsidized and fastest growing new technology existing \nin the United States today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona has 9 minutes, the \nSenator from Tennessee has 1 minute 15 seconds, and the Senator from \nNorth Dakota has 18\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, it is obvious from the most recent \ndiscussion\n\n[[Page S4400]]\n\nbetween my colleagues--Senator Alexander, Senator Wyden, and others--\nthat if this had been easy to fix, it would have been fixed.\n  I talked to Senator McCain last evening before we broke, and we \ntalked a bit about the process that brought this bill to the floor of \nthe Senate. This bill came from the Commerce Committee. We tried, \nduring the markup in the Commerce Committee, to reach an agreement \nabout the definition. The definition is really the critical piece here, \nand we were not successful in the committee.\n  We agreed, when we reported it out of the Commerce Committee, that we \nwould continue to work to try to see if we could find an acceptable \ndefinition that would represent a compromise. Frankly, we did that. \nSenator McCain kept his word. We all continued to talk and work to see \nif, before we brought this bill to the floor, we would have that \nagreement. But the fact is, we did not reach an agreement. So now we \nhave very differing views about exactly how we should proceed.\n  For my purpose, it does not matter to me whether the moratorium is 1 \nyear, 2 years, 5 years. That is much less relevant to me than the \nquestion of this definition, of exactly what cannot be taxed, exactly \nwhat we are doing with the definition, exactly what consequences that \ndefinition would have on State and local revenues, and on the taxation \nof certain products and services. The determination of how we create a \ndefinition that represents the interests that all of us want is what is \ncritical. At this point, we have been unable to do that.\n  So my hope would be that while this bill is on the floor of the \nSenate, we can find a way to reach a compromise that is satisfactory. \nAt this point, I would not support the underlying bill that is on the \nfloor with the definition as it currently exists. But what we ought to \ndo is find a way by which we create a definition that does exactly what \nthe Senate wants it to do, without being broader than is necessary to \nsubstantially erode the revenue base that now exists with State and \nlocal governments. I think that is possible, but it is not easy.\n  Listening to the discussion of Senator Alexander and Senator Wyden \nand others demonstrates this is very complicated. It happens I have \nworked in this area for some while because of the issue Senator Enzi \nand I have worked on, which is not a part of this discussion today, but \nthe one in which we talk about the issue of the consumption tax that \nexists when you buy a product, for example, from a catalog, from a \nremote seller, or perhaps over the Internet. When you purchase that \nproduct over the Internet or from a catalog, you actually owe a tax; \nyou just don't pay it. Nobody pays that tax or almost no one pays the \ntax. It is called a use tax.\n  The use tax is applied when the sales tax is not collected. But no \none pays, or almost no one pays the use tax. So there is a substantial \namount of money being lost to State and local governments for the \nsupport of schools and other services.\n  In addition, the folks on Main Street who actually sell the product \nfrom their storefront must charge the tax, and their competitor over \nthe Internet sells without charging a tax. So there is a competitive \nissue that is a problem for local businesses as well. But the issue \nSenator Enzi and I and many others are concerned about and want to fix \nis not a part of the discussion. This is a narrower discussion about \nthe moratorium that previously existed with respect to the imposition \nof a tax on the connection to the Internet. I have no disagreement with \nrespect to the goals of those who want to prevent taxing ``the Internet \nconnection'' in order not to retard the growth of broadband and the \nbuildout of the infrastructure. We have no disagreement about that. I \nsupport the moratorium. I supported the previous moratorium. Again, it \nis of little matter to me whether it is 1 year or 5 years or even \nlonger.\n  What is of great moment to me is how this definition is written. \nBecause if it is written inappropriately, there could be a very \nsignificant set of unintended consequences that could be very costly to \nState and local governments and to their ability to fund education and \nother matters.\n  In summary, what I say is this: The bill is on the floor at the \nmoment. One of the central pieces of the bill is at this point in great \ndispute. Unless we can find a way to negotiate a compromise on that \ndefinition, my guess is this legislation will not advance. I would \nprefer that it does advance. I hope we can find a compromise in the \ncoming hours and days so that we write this definition in a manner that \nexpresses the intent of the Senate and are able to move the legislation \nforward.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nunanimous consent that the time be equally charged to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. WYDEN. I believe this time should be taken from the time \nallocated to Chairman McCain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, Chairman McCain, I and others who have \nworked on this effort to try to find common ground thought it was \nimportant early on to begin efforts to find some areas of agreement \nthat would bring the sides together. Let me outline 10 particular areas \nof compromise we have essentially offered in the managers' proposal.\n  I, for example, strongly believe there should be a permanent ban on \nmultiple and discriminatory taxes on Internet access. But in the name \nof trying to find a compromise, now we have a 4-year moratorium. We \nhave a 3-year phaseout of the grandfather clause. This was something \nthat was important to the States. We have a 2-year grandfather of taxes \non DSL. Again, as I talked earlier, that is the technology of the \nfuture.\n  A fourth compromise reflects the concern about voiceover. What we \nhave done is clarified that our legislation is not going to affect \ntaxation of voice communication services utilizing the voiceover \nInternet protocol. We have clarified the taxes that would be covered, \naddressed a number of concerns the States had with respect to income \nand property taxes. We want to make sure those taxes, those \nopportunities for State and local revenue are protected.\n  We clarified the House language on DSL which was something State and \nlocal groups complained was too open-ended and vague.\n  With respect to the bundling of services, States and localities asked \nfor a clear and uniform accounting rule. We protected universal \nservices. We protected e-911 taxes, and we also made clear nontax \nregulatory powers would not be affected.\n  I thank the chairman for this time. I only wanted the Senate to know \nthat as you tried to bring both sides together, there were 10 specific \nareas of compromise that were offered. I thank him for the time.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six minutes 40 seconds.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I reserve 5 minutes for the Senator from \nVirginia when he arrives. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Let me, in response to my colleague from Oregon, say once again I \nbelieve we ought to pass this legislation dealing with a moratorium. \nThere might be 5, 10, 15, or 50 areas in which we have worked to try to \nreach compromise. I don't know the exact number, but I would not \ndispute that. I simply say again: The problem remains the definition of \nwhat is determined to be in the law that represents the moratorium \nimpact; that is, what is the definition of the Internet service? What \nexactly are you precluding from a State and local tax base? Is it now \ntaxed? Would it be taxed in the future. It is obviously very \ncomplicated. If it were not complicated, I believe Senator Alexander\n\n[[Page S4401]]\n\nand Senator Allen and Senator Voinovich and others would have long ago \nreached a compromise. But that has not been the case.\n  Perhaps one of the things we could do during this discussion and the \nensuing debate today, tomorrow, and beyond, if that is what it takes, \nis at least begin to understand exactly what is in the compromise that \nis being proposed and what is in the legislation that has been offered \nby Senator Alexander and Senator Carper in their 2-year moratorium, \ncalled S. 2084. But again, if this were easy, compromise would already \nhave been reached. It is not easy. It is very complicated and difficult \nand hard to understand.\n  I have been in a good number of meetings in which it appears to me \nvirtually everyone, including myself, failed to understand what we were \ndebating, but we debated it aggressively nonetheless. My hope is we can \ndo better than that this time. We have had a good start with some of \nthe discussion back and forth earlier today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia has 5 minutes.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I would like to address this issue as it \nlays right now as we are moving to proceed, and some of the \nmisinformation, mischaracterizations of where we are. This issue is not \na novel or new one for the Senate. We have debated this in the \ncommittee. It has been on the floor. Senator Wyden and I were ready to \nroll with this back in November--a permanent moratorium making sure \nforever there would not be discriminatory taxes, multiple taxes, or \naccess taxes for consumers on the Internet. Now we get to this point \nand there are a lot of mischaracterizations.\n  The Senator from Arizona, chairman of the Commerce Committee, has \ncome up with a proposal, an amendment to the bill, which is not \npermanent. To me it is not ideal. It is not perfect. But a lot of what \nhappens in the Senate fails to meet that standard of ideal and perfect. \nOnce in a while, one has to be practical, pragmatic, and sometimes cut \nback on what you think is the ideal.\n  This amendment of the Senator from Arizona is a 4-year moratorium \nrather than a permanent moratorium. I look at a ``Dear Colleague'' \nletter from some of my colleagues, Senator Carper and Senator \nAlexander, and they say: A moratorium of 4 years, that is tantamount to \na permanent moratorium while they argue for a 2-year extension of a \nmoratorium.\n  Well, if 4 years is permanent, I guess whoever gets elected President \nnext year is going to be there permanently; Senators with a 6-year \nterm, that must be ad infinitum. Four years is temporary; it is not \nideal. I would prefer it to be permanent, and the reason I would like \nit to be permanent is because companies have to invest millions, tens \nof millions of dollars, if they are going to get broadband out, \nespecially small towns and rural areas. In the event there is a shorter \nduration, then that means it is less likely that there will be \nstability, predictability, and confidence that the laws will stay the \nsame. Anyone, even those with a fourth grade education--at least those \nstudents who have the benefit of Virginia's standards of learning--will \nunderstand that if you tax something, fewer people will be able to \nafford it.\n\n  The question before the Senate is whether we want to have Internet \naccess and the Internet service monthly bills to be burdened with, on \naverage, about a 17-percent tax, as is the case on telephone bills. \nSenator Wyden, myself, and many others believe that if we want more \npeople to have access to broadband and the Internet, then the best way \nis not to burden it with regulations or taxes. This is particularly \ntrue for those with lower incomes and those in rural areas and small \ntowns, who need access to the ability to conduct commerce, access to \neducation, access to telemedicine--access to all forms of information, \nwhich is key to competitiveness these days.\n  The grandfather clause has also been changed from the bill Senator \nWyden and I originally introduced. We wanted to stop those who found a \nloophole in the original moratorium and started taxing the backbone of \nthe Internet. They are taxing that and, of course, ultimately the \nconsumer has to pay for those taxes. We wanted to stop that \nimmediately. Senator McCain's amendment gives those States greater \nleeway and gives them up to 2 years to wean themselves off of this \nlatest loophole for taxation. For those who have been taxing prior to \n1998--and many States are still taxing--although States such as Iowa, \nSouth Carolina, Connecticut, and the District of Columbia, which were \ngrandfathered, have stopped taxing Internet access. But other States \nare continuing to do so. Senator McCain's amendment--unlike what the \nHouse did, which was stopping these States from taxing instantly--gives \nthem 3 years to wean themselves off of it.\n  The compromise that Senator McCain put forward, to me, is not ideal; \nit is beneficial, though, in that at least for the next 4 years we are \nprotecting consumers from being hit with these burdensome, \ncounterproductive, undesirable taxes on their access to the Internet. \nWhile not perfect, it is a measure that we can move forward with. It \nwill have the Senate on record as not being in favor of taxing access \nto the Internet, but rather on the side of the consumers, on the side \nof freedom, and on the side of opportunity.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 5 minutes.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Therefore, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, how much time remains on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has 10 minutes \n45 seconds. The Senator from Arizona has 1 minute 26 seconds. The \nSenator from Tennessee has 1 minute 15 seconds.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I think we are probably ready to go to the \nbill. Let me make a point, however, with respect to my colleague from \nVirginia.\n  Look, once again, there is no disagreement in this Chamber about the \nquestion of whether we would support punitive or discriminatory taxes \nwith respect to the Internet. The answer is, of course not. I don't \ncare how long the moratorium is for. Let it be forever, as far as I am \nconcerned. That is not the issue. The issue with the legislation \nproposed is what kind of definition exists, and what will the impact of \nthat definition be on the revenue base of the State and local \ngovernments?\n  If we can get that definition squared away in a thoughtful and \nappropriate way, we ought to pass this 100-0. I regret that that is not \nthe case with respect to the compromise offered. That should not \nsurprise anybody because this has gone on now for some months. It is \ncomplicated, and we have found it difficult to reach agreement or an \nacceptable compromise at this point. I expect the likely thing to have \nhappen here is we will be on the bill itself and it will be open to \namendment. We can have amendments, and perhaps second degrees, and we \nwill have discussion and votes and find out how the Senate feels about \nthe specific definitions.\n  Again, the question of whether there should be support for a \ndiscriminatory or punitive tax on the Internet--that ought not to be a \nquestion. I think the answer to that is, no, absolutely not. Whether it \nis 1 year, 3 years, or 5 years, that is not a very big issue for me. We \nneed, in the coming hours, to focus on the question of, What is the \nright definition? What do we intend to accomplish, and how do we define \nit in a way that is fair to everybody?\n  I believe we ought to have public policy that encourages the buildout \nof broadband in this country. I think it will help this country's \neconomy and be something that stimulates economic growth in our \ncountry. Whatever we do with this legislation, I don't want to retard \nthe growth of broadband and the development of the Internet. I think \nthat I speak for almost all of my colleagues when I say that. Let's \nfind a way to write this definition in an appropriate manner and that \nis satisfactory and move ahead. At this point, it hasn't been done even \nwith the compromise. We have much work to do to reach that point.\n  Mr. President, I ask, does the Senator from Tennessee seek time?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Yes, I seek 30 to 45 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized for \n45 seconds.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I want to simply echo what the \ndistinguished Senator from North Dakota\n\n[[Page S4402]]\n\nsaid. I am perfectly willing and prepared to vote for a short-term ban \non State and local taxation of pure Internet access, and I have been \nready to do that since December. So I am for that. I can step over here \nand take my purist position and give you a long argument on why we \ndon't need to do that and make that kind of subsidy, but I know there \nare 100 Members here and we all have to pitch in. I am ready to do \nthat.\n  All we have to fix in the McCain proposal is the definition, which \nthe Senator has just mentioned. We have to make clear, in my view, that \nnothing in this bill should preclude State and local governments from \ntaxing telephone services, including telephone calls made over the \nInternet. That is two. The short term is three. I prefer 2 years, not 4 \nyears. The fourth item is the grandfather clause, which ought to be \neasy to fix. They ought to end at the same time the moratorium ends. So \nthat is not many points of difference--the definition, telephone calls \nover the Internet, and the term of the grandfather clause.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my understanding is that Senator McCain is \njust off the Senate floor and will be returning in a moment. Until he \nreturns, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, how much time remains on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has 2 minutes 55 \nseconds remaining, and the Senator from Arizona has 1 minute 26 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am prepared to yield back my time if that is the \nintention of the Senator from Arizona. That being the case, I yield \nback my time.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time having been yielded back, under the \nprevious order, the motion to proceed is agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/27/senate-section/article/S4402-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4402-S4422]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   INTERNET TAX NONDISCRIMINATION ACT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       The amendments made by this Act take effect on November 1, \n     2003.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this substitute, which I will describe in \nmore detail in a minute, is, I hope, a fair and true compromise between \nthe opposing sides in this debate. At least I hope it is viewed by a \nmajority of the Senate as such.\n  I also understand there are very strongly held views on this issue. \nThis is not the first time we have been to the Senate floor on this \nissue. This is the third time we have had debate and votes on it, and \neach time it becomes more difficult because we are talking about a lot \nmore money, a lot more involvement, a lot more taxes and, of course, as \ntechnology evolves, of greater importance to America, whether it be \neconomically, whether it be entertainment, or politically. The rise of \nthe Internet in political campaigns in America today is one of the most \nrecent phenomena.\n  I hope since we have, at least according to a letter I received from \nSenator Alexander, boiled down our differences to four major \ndifferences--I in no way understate the importance of those \ndifferences, but there are only four--perhaps we could propose \namendments and vote on those four differences and, in the meantime, \ncontinue our dialog in trying to reach a reasonable compromise.\n  I would like to point out it does no one any good for us to leave \nthis issue in limbo. If we are going to allow taxation of the Internet \nin a broad variety of ways, then the Senate should decide to do so. If \nwe are going to adopt this compromise, then the Senate should do so. \nThe House, as we know, long ago passed legislation.\n  This particular legislation, before I offered a substitute amendment, \nwas reported out of the committee 10 months ago. I hope all will act \ntogether in good faith and try and resolve it.\n  By the way, those four major differences, as defined in the letter to \nme from Senator Alexander, are definition, voice over IP, duration, and \ngrandfather clause. I hope we can address each of those either, as I \nsaid, in the form of negotiation or in the form of amendments which \nwould be up or down.\n  I have been told the majority leader says we are going to complete \naction on this bill by Thursday night late. The Democrats have a \nretreat beginning on Friday which we all respect. I hope we can get a \nlot done so we do not find ourselves here at a very late hour on \nThursday night.\n  Mr. President, I offer this amendment to the Internet Tax \nNondiscrimination Act which offers, I believe, a true and fair \ncompromise. On one end of the spectrum are those who do not believe the \ntax moratorium should be extended, and on the other end are those who \nwant to make it permanent. This proposal, I believe, offers a middle-\nground alternative to this debate and addresses the concerns State and \nlocal governments have expressed, while retaining some--many have said \ntoo few--aspects of the bill that was favorably reported by the \nCommerce Committee last year.\n  Before I summarize the substance of the amendment, I would like to \nspend a moment addressing a couple criticisms that have been raised \nabout the compromise proposal.\n  First, I have heard a few Members talk about how consideration of S. \n150 is moving too fast and that Members and their staffs have not had \nadequate opportunity to consider the substance of this matter.\n  With all due respect to my colleagues who believe this has been a \nless than deliberative process, I can think of few debates recently in \nwhich Members have had more time to prepare and negotiate. We voted the \nbill out of the Commerce Committee in July of last year. The Finance \nCommittee, after requesting a sequential referral, discharged the bill \nwithout amending it.\n  Throughout this time, Members, including Senators Dorgan, Hollings, \nAllen, Wyden, Sununu, and many others who have spoken on this floor \nabout this matter, continued to negotiate the substance of the \nlegislation.\n  During that time, we heard from State and local groups such as the \nNational Governors Association and the National Association of \nCounties. They had several opportunities, and did, to provide \nsignificant input.\n  We are here after almost 1 year of considering this matter, not \nbecause we have not discussed the issue thoroughly enough. Nor are we \nhere because we have not properly defined Internet access or otherwise \nadequately dealt with the specifics of the Internet tax moratorium. We \nare debating this measure because the two opposing sides will not budge \nfrom their positions.\n  To be clear, the compromise amendment will not likely move those who \nare firmly on one side or the other. As Senator Voinovich said \nyesterday, for some Members the philosophical divide in this debate may \nbe ``too deep to bridge.'' Its purpose is only to offer a compromise \nthat other Members can vote for knowing that it strikes a reasonable \nbalance between those who want a permanent and broad Internet access \ntax moratorium and those who want no moratorium at all.\n  Second, some Members who do not want to reinstate the Internet tax \nmoratorium have expressed their view that the amendment is not a true \ncompromise; that it does not go all the way to meeting their concerns \nabout State and local revenues. I must respond to them by saying the \namendment is a compromise precisely because it does not completely \nsatisfy one side or the other. However, the amendment does protect a \nsignificant portion of the $20 billion in tax revenues from \ntelecommunications services that States and localities claim they could \nlose as a result of S. 150.\n  In fact, even using the most aggressive revenue loss estimates \navailable, it appears what is at stake is not more than 3.5 percent of \ntotal State and local tax revenues from telecommunications services. In \nmy opinion, that is not just a compromise but a very generous \nconcession to those who want to defeat the Internet tax moratorium. To \ncriticize this proposal at this point as somehow not enough is just an \nempty exercise in moving the proverbial goalpost of this debate.\n  It seems to me the goalpost continues to move so much that it would \nnot surprise me to hear at the end of this week that some Members \nactually support a Federal law requiring States to tax Internet access. \nI remind my colleagues that this debate is about striking a balance \nbetween S. 150, the Allen-Wyden bill, and S. 2084, the Alexander-Carper \nbill.\n  Clearly, this amendment goes a long way to compromising with the \nopponents of the Internet tax moratorium. Again, I have to repeat this \nbecause it is a crucial point: This body does not typically operate by \ncapitulating 100 percent to one side or the other on a particular \nmatter that is before it. In its normal course of business, the Senate \ncompromises, and that is exactly what this amendment does.\n  Simply put, the amendment offered today is truly a reasonable \ncompromise that addresses a host of concerns the States and localities \nhave raised over the past 10 months. Throughout the negotiation \nprocess, State and local\n\n[[Page S4404]]\n\ngroups have asked for a temporary extension to the Internet tax \nmoratorium. Specifically, they have asked for a 2-year extension of the \nmoratorium. The compromise amendment would extend the moratorium for 4 \nyears.\n  Why 4 years? If we do it for 2 years, we would almost automatically \nbe back revisiting the issue immediately when one looks at the process \nwe have just been through. I think 4 years is a great deal less than \npermanent and not much more than 2 years, as the opponents of this \nlegislation have alleged.\n\n  Another concern we have heard from State and local government is \nextending the Internet tax moratorium would somehow impact traditional \ntelephone services. This amendment would ensure that State and local \nrevenues from traditional phone service would not be impacted in any \nway, shape, or form. Again, the amendment would accommodate a concern \nraised by States and localities to the full satisfaction of State and \nlocal authorities.\n  State and local governments have also expressed concern that this \nbill would hamper their ability to tax voice services provided over the \nInternet. This amendment addresses that matter by setting forth a broad \ndefinition of services, including voice services that are provided over \nthe Internet that would not be considered Internet access and therefore \nnot be subject to the Internet tax moratorium. Once again, I believe \nthis provision should fully address the concern of State and local \ngovernments.\n  The list of concessions made to State and local government interests \nin the amendment is extensive. For example, the compromise amendment \nwould clarify that the Internet tax moratorium does not apply to \nnontransactional taxes such as taxes on net income, net worth, or \nproperty value. The amendment would clarify that otherwise taxable \nservices would not become tax free solely because they are offered as a \npackage with Internet access. The amendment would grandfather for 3 \nyears, from November 1, 2003, the States that were taxing Internet \naccess in October 1998. It would grandfather for 2 years, from November \n1, 2003, the States that began to tax--according to many, improperly--\nInternet access after October 1998. It would ensure that universal \nservice would not be affected by the moratorium. It would ensure that \n9-1-1 and e-9-1-1 services would not be affected by the moratorium. \nFinally, it would ensure that regulatory proceedings that do not relate \nto taxation would not be impacted by the Internet tax moratorium.\n  I want to point out again, there are really 10 compromises offered in \nthis: the 4-year moratorium, the 3-year phaseout of the grandfather \nclause, the 2-year grandfather of taxes on DSL, and voice over IP \ncarve-out. It clarifies taxes covered. It clarifies the House's \nlanguage on DSL. It provides a clear and uniform accounting rule. The \nuniversal service fees are unaffected. As I mentioned, e-9-1-1 taxes \nare unaffected, and nontax regulatory powers are unaffected.\n  I hope we can move forward if there is not agreement. Meanwhile, we \ncontinue to discuss the issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my colleague from Arizona talks about four \nissues. There are three of them we really ought to be able to reach \nagreement on reasonably soon, and the other one is a very difficult \nissue, there is no question about that. That is the definition. But on \ngrandfathering and VOIP, for example, the length of time of a \nmoratorium, frankly, I think we can reach an agreement on those three \nareas.\n  Frankly, if we are able to reach an agreement on the definition, I do \nnot care much about the grandfathering. I know some of my colleagues \ndo, but that is a lot less important to me. I would also say that the \nlength of a moratorium on Internet taxation is of much less importance \nto me as well. I would be willing to lengthen it by a substantial \nnumber of years provided we have the right definition. So I think the \nthing that is going to be difficult for us but one that we should \nattempt to resolve is this definition.\n  I want to just make this point: If the purpose of those who are most \ninsistent on moving this legislation--and there are several in the \nChamber who have really worked on this a long time--would be, for \nexample, to create a broad new exemption from taxation for certain \nservices and certain parts of the backbone of the Internet and so on, \nthen that is a problem. I do not support that. I do not think we ought \nto carve out things that are now being taxed by State and local \ngovernments and say, by the way, we are going to federally preempt \nthat. If that is not the purpose, though, then we surely should be able \nto find common ground on a definition that works.\n  My hope is that as we proceed we will understand that all of us--I \nthink I speak for all of us--believe we ought to have a moratorium on \ntaxing the Internet, that is, the connection to the Internet. I support \nthat. I believe virtually all of us in this Chamber would agree we \nought not levy punitive or discriminatory taxes on the Internet. I \nbelieve we would all agree on the goal that we would want to encourage \nthrough public policy the build out of broadband and the use of the \nInternet and particularly advanced telecommunications services. All of \nthose represent areas of broad, substantial agreement in the Senate \nChamber.\n  As we work through this now, the one area where I think we have \nsubstantial difficulties is trying to understand what each side means \nwith respect to the definition of Internet service. How far up the \nbackbone of the Internet does it go? Is it a definition that, in fact, \nwould prevent the taxation of certain services that are now taxed, and \non which State and local governments rely for that revenue? If that is \nthe case, we ought to know that and discuss that. If it is not the \ncase, we should be able to reach an agreement on the definition.\n\n  Senator Allen, for example, and many others who have been at this, \nSenator Wyden and on the other side Senators Carper and Alexander and \nmany others--we need to once again get our heads together and see if we \ncan find agreement on this definition. But until that happens and \nunless that happens, it is my guess we are just going to be around here \nspinning our big old tractor wheels and nothing is going to happen. We \nare not going to pass legislation.\n  We are not going to agree to amendments. I am guessing the consensus \nwouldn't exist to do that. I wouldn't object to going to vote on some \nthings, speaking for myself, but we have a lot of work to do to reach \nsome sort of compromise. Let me say to my colleague Senator McCain, I \nrecall being in meetings with him a year ago and beyond that, and the \nattempt was to try to figure out, how can we find common ground? How \ncan we extend the moratorium that then existed? We never got to the \npoint of reaching any kind of agreement, but it wasn't because of any \nlack of effort on the part of the chairman of the committee. I am here. \nI will be here during consideration of this, and I want to work with \nSenator McCain and others to see if we can find a way to make this \nwork.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3049 to Amendment No. 3048\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mrs. Hutchison] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3049 to amendment No. 3048.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     (Purpose: To change the definition of Internet access service)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. CHANGE IN DEFINITION OF INTERNET ACCESS SERVICE.\n\n       Paragraph (10) of section 1105 of the Internet Tax Freedom \n     Act, as redesignated by this Act, is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``The term'' and inserting the following:\n       ``(A) In general.--The term''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(B) General exception.--The term does not--\n       ``(i) include a tax levied upon or measured by net income, \n     capital stock, net worth, or property value; or\n       ``(ii) apply to any payment made for use of the public \n     right-of-way or made in lieu of a\n\n[[Page S4405]]\n\n     fee for use of the public right-of-way, however it may be \n     denominated, including but not limited to an access line fee, \n     franchise fee, license fee, or gross receipts or gross \n     revenue fee.''.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arizona, the \nchairman of the Commerce Committee, and the distinguished ranking \nmember, Senator Dorgan, for bringing this to the floor. As has been \nsaid by everyone, I think, we have been talking about this issue for a \nlong time. It is such a crucial issue for many States and many cities, \nthat we must get it right.\n  I think the bill of Senator Allen, the underlying bill, and now the \nbill of Senator McCain are attempting to do something that is right. \nThey are attempting to assure that interstate commerce is not \nobstructed by taxes on Internet access.\n  I am afraid, however, that the language is not clear enough as it \ndeals with franchise taxes and right-of-way fees that have been in \nplace in cities in many States in our country for a long time. That is \nwhy I have introduced an amendment that will clarify the definition of \nwhat is excepted from this Internet access tax ban. It says:\n\n     . . . any payment made for the use of a public right-of-way \n     or made in lieu of a fee for use of the public right-of-way, \n     however it may be denominated, including but not limited to \n     an access line fee, a franchise fee, license fee or gross \n     receipts or gross revenue fee.\n\n  I think we have found out since we started debating this issue years \nago that cities determine their franchise fees, their right-of-way \nfees, in many different ways. I think it is very important that we not \nmake a mistake here that would cause years of litigation, after which a \ncity might win, it might lose, but it would certainly disrupt what it \nhas been doing. The franchise fee is basically a local tax, not on \nInternet access, not meant to be on Internet access.\n  My position is that we should not tax Internet access. I do believe \nit is a taxation of interstate commerce. However, I think that once you \nget off the basic access, just as we have telephone lines' access, use \nof right-of-way, that we must create a level playing field so a line \nthat is used for telephone and an Internet computer line will be able \nto be taxed in the same way.\n  In my State of Texas, prior to 1999 cities were compensated by \ntelecommunications providers for the use of their rights-of-way \npursuant to individual franchise agreements negotiated between the \ntelecommunications company and the cities.\n  In the late 1990s, Texas cities and the providers began negotiating \nand drafting major compromises that would lead to more uniformity, more \nregulatory certainty. So the Texas law has established a uniform method \nof compensating cities for use of public rights-of-way. It is called a \nper access line fee. It is implemented to compensate cities for use of \npublic rights-of-way.\n  The access lines are reported by the individual telecommunications \nproviders to the Texas Public Utility Commission. The PUC then applies \nthe individual city rate per access line to the total number of lines \nthat a particular city may have within their corporate limits. It is a \nfair and equitable system that is used in Texas. An average city gets \nabout 3.5 percent of its general revenue from telecommunications right-\nof-way compensation fees.\n  Passing Federal legislation that would call into question the \nvalidity of this Texas system could have disastrous effects on the \nability of Texas cities to provide essential services such as police \nand fire, water, waste water, and parks, just to name a few. The right-\nof-way fees represent as much as $39 million annually to the city of \nDallas; $9 million for Fort Worth; and $15 million for the city of San \nAntonio.\n  Cities in California, Nevada, Florida, Kentucky, and other States \nwould also be adversely affected by the bill as it is written. So I am \ntrying to clarify why franchise fees should be included. I am hoping we \nare all trying to go in the same direction here. I just want to make \nsure that we don't make a mistake.\n\n  There will be people who say it is really covered. It is covered in \nthe underlying law. It is covered in the amendment that is offered by \nSenator McCain and the one underlying by Senator Allen. People will say \nthat. However, it is not clear and the city attorneys and these Texas \ncities and other States have looked at the language and they are very \nconcerned they are going to be in litigation over this issue. If we \nknow today that it is not clear, after the lawyers have looked at it, \nwhy not be sure? Why not be sure?\n  Everyone I have talked to believes that right-of-way and franchise \nfees should not be disturbed. It is part of the level playing field we \nare trying to create. My amendment will make it very clear what is \naccepted by definition. This should not have any impact on Internet \naccess as both of the underlying bills would try to protect that from \ntaxation. But it does protect cities, particularly since we have \ncertain laws in some States that do have a component of a gross \nreceipts fee within the access line issue, and I hope we will not step \non a State with its local issues, trying to stay consistent with what \nhas been done and accepted through all these years by passing this law \nwithout being very clear.\n  Mine is a clarification amendment.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I want to make sure I understand this. Cable already pays \na franchise fee when the streets are torn up in order to offer cable. \nMy understanding of this amendment is that now there would be a new \nspecial tax for right-of-way for the very same service.\n  In effect, my reading of this is that cable would be taxed twice. \nThey already get hit with a franchise fee and now your right-of-way \nprovision would allow for a new special fee, which troubles me, again, \nbecause it has been our point all along through Internet access that \nyou have already paid once.\n  Could my colleague from Texas clarify? Otherwise, I would have to \nstrongly oppose this.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I appreciate the question.\n  This is, of course, not to put a new tax in place. This is to try to \nacknowledge that different cities and different States have different \ndefinitions of franchise tax. It happens that in Texas there is a \ngross-receipts component in the franchise right-of-way access tax. It \nis a standardized law now for the cities of Texas, for cable companies \nand telecommunications companies.\n  We have a different definition which I am trying to protect. \nCertainly these cities have already made their contracts with their \ncable companies. This is not meant to change contracts; it is meant to \nallow the contracts which are in existence and use a well recognized \nand different definition of franchise or right-of-way tax.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this amendment excludes from the \ndefinition of tax on Internet access transactional taxes such as gross \nreceipts or gross revenue fees, constitutes an end run around Internet \ntax freedom, and eviscerates the moratorium itself. If we allow this to \nexclude payments made for use of the public right-of-way, including \naccess line fees, franchise fees, et cetera, this amendment should be \nrejected.\n  I move to table the amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I announce that the Senator from South Carolina (Mr. \nGraham) and the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Specter) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk to the \nunderlying bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Daschle] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3050.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  [The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'']\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I want very much to be able to continue \nto work on the underlying bill and find a way to resolve many of the \noutstanding issues. I think we have made some progress today.\n  Obviously, this is a piece of legislation that provides an \nopportunity for many of us who have concerns about other matters \nrelating to our Senate agenda as well.\n  I was very concerned this morning to read in Energy Daily that the \nleadership has abandoned its plan to bring up the comprehensive Energy \nbill in May, and may wait now until fall to revisit comprehensive \nenergy legislation.\n  Now, nearly 6 months after we could have enacted an Energy bill with \nthe renewable fuels standard and other important components there is no \nprospect now of action on the legislation any time soon. So I have no \nrecourse but to offer the renewable fuels amendment to another \nlegislative vehicle, which I have done with this amendment.\n  The amendment is very straightforward. It is based on language that \nhas passed in the Senate on two previous occasions. It eliminates the \nreformulated gasoline program, RFG, oxygenate standard and replaces it \nwith a renewable fuels standard that sets a 10-year schedule for \nassured growth in ethanol demand.\n  It contains the same waiver authority agreed to in the energy \nconference report, strikes all liability protection for MTBE as well as \nethanol.\n  It also bans MTBE within 4 years.\n  Over two-thirds of the Senate has now gone on record in support of a \nrenewable fuels standard and the renewable fuels standard we create \nwith this legislation. It has been reported out of committee twice, \npassed by the Senate twice, both times by a margin of more than two-\nthirds. A similar proposal has been reported out of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee and is pending now on the Senate calendar.\n  Last June, 68 Senators voted to add at that time the Frist-Daschle \nRFS amendment to the Energy bill. It is time to break the impasse.\n  As I said, my first choice would have been to bring the Energy bill \nto the floor, have a good debate, and send it on to the President \nwithout the MTBE liability immunity.\n  However, the Energy bill conference report stalled last November \nbecause of bipartisan opposition to the special interest MTBE liability \nrelief provision included in that legislation, in spite of the efforts \nmade by many of us to warn that is exactly what would happen. Dropping \nthe liability protection from the bill for both MTBE and ethanol would \nhave attracted more than enough votes to enact the Energy bill. Yet \ndespite the direct intervention by President Bush, the defenders of \nMTBE liability relief remain defiant.\n  Senator Frist placed a revised energy bill without MTBE on the Senate \ncalendar last February, now almost 3 months ago. He has not chosen to \ncall up that bill.\n  Today, Energy Daily has reported our Republican friends have \nabandoned plans to move comprehensive energy legislation any time in \nthe near future. That is troubling for many of us who wanted to see it \npass. Now we have little choice but to offer very important components \nof this bill to other legislation that may move through the Senate as \nwell as the House.\n  The energy tax provisions, for example, that Senator Frist placed on \nthe calendar have now been added to the FSC/ETI bill. Senators Cantwell \nand Bingaman are leading the effort to pass stand-alone electricity \nstandards to address the circumstances that caused the blackout last \nAugust.\n  It appears it is time to shift gears, not only for the tax provisions \nand the reliability standards, but for the renewable fuels standard as \nwell. This bipartisan amendment is a careful balance of the often \ndesperate and competing interests and a compromise in the finest \ntradition of the Senate. As I have said on many occasions, two-thirds \nof the Senate is on record in support of the bill. So I hope we can get \nlegislation such as this considered quickly.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk. We \ncan vitiate it if we get an agreement on a rollcall vote shortly. I am \nvery concerned that we move this legislation quickly and \ncomprehensively. This amendment is yet another attempt to do that in \nthis body.\n  I ask that the motion be reported.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of Rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close the debate on the Daschle \n     amendment No. 3050 to S. 150:\n         Thomas Daschle, Harry Reid, Jeff Bingaman, Kent Conrad, \n           Byron L.

Akaka, Evan Bayh, Debbie Stabenow, Mark \n           Dayton, Jay Rockefeller, Ben Nelson, Tim Johnson, Carl \n           Levin.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I was not aware, and I do not believe the \nmanager of the legislation who is temporarily off the floor was aware, \nthis amendment would be offered at this time. He will return shortly. I \nam sure there are going to be some discussions about the amendment and \nthe appropriate way for us to deal with it.\n  I understand the importance of this amendment that has been offered \nby Senator Daschle to a number of Senators on both sides of the aisle. \nI agree we should have a national energy policy. We have been talking \nabout it for at least 3 years or longer. Yet here we stand today with \nno national energy policy. We do not have legislation on the books that \ngives incentives for more production of oil and gas to relieve some of \nthe regulatory problems that delay or make it almost impossible to have \nnuclear plants, hydropower, conservation, alternative fuels, ethanol--\nthe whole package. Yet last year, the Senate passed energy legislation. \nThe House passed it. We had a conference.\n  Problems developed in the conference, and we have not been able, \nunfortunately, to move the energy legislation through the Senate \nbecause we have not been able to get 60 votes, even though we had, I \nthink, 57 or 58 who voted for the bill.\n  I still think we should find a way to get this legislation through a \nconference or through to completion and\n\n[[Page S4407]]\n\nsend it to the President. If we do not, a pox on all our houses because \nproblems are here. They are going to stay, and they are going to get \nworse. We are not going to conserve. We are not going to produce. We \nare not going to do anything. We are at the mercy, then, of countries \nall over the world to provide the oil for over 50 percent of our energy \nneeds in this country. This is dangerous.\n  We need a national energy policy because of economic security and \nnational security. So I agree we need to do this. I do not agree with \nall the features in it. I did not like some of the provisions added at \nthe end in the conference. I have my reservations about some of the \nrenewable fuels. I have reservations about a lot of it, but I voted for \nit, and I am prepared to vote for it again in its current form with \nwarts or with another problem. We should deal with this problem.\n  There is one way we will not deal with it comprehensively or deal \nwith it at all, probably, and that is to pick it apart, pick all the \nmeat off the bones of this national energy policy legislation. Piece by \npiece we will devour this good legislation, for example by putting a \npiece of it on the FSC/ETI jobs growth bill. If we put tax policies \nthere, put ethanol here, or put it somewhere else, and start picking it \napart piece by piece, what will happen is we will probably not get a \ncomprehensive bill, and we probably will not even get the pieces. This \nis not wise.\n  I do not have the impression that it has been indicated by our \nleadership that we are not going to do an energy bill. I think it is on \nthe agenda to be considered further, and it should be considered \nfurther.\n  We should work in a bipartisan and a bicameral way to get this \nlegislation done. For that reason, I think it is a huge mistake to come \npull out this one piece a lot of people do like and stick it on this \nlegislation, because it is one of the engines that could possibly pull \nus to a national energy policy.\n  We will have discussion over the next few minutes about the way we \nwould like to deal with it. But I personally do not think we should be \nadding this nongermane amendment, a critical part of the Energy bill, \non this bill.\n  I would also like to say briefly that I think we have a good \ncompromise package which Senator McCain, the chairman of the Commerce \nCommittee, has developed. He has worked over a long period of time with \nboth the proponents and opponents to see if we could find compromise \nlanguage on this Internet tax issue that was acceptable to get the job \ndone.\n  It has not been easy because neither side wants to give. The \nproponents do not want even a 4-year moratorium. They want a permanent \nmoratorium on Internet access taxes. I have in the past been inclined \nto be in that camp.\n  However, I have listened to Senator Alexander and Senator Voinovich. \nI have heard from the Governor of my own State, and there is an \nargument on the other side, there is no question about this. We need to \ndeal with this whole issue in a comprehensive way. The Commerce \nCommittee needs some time and it will not be easy.\n  I went through the legislative process for telecommunications reform \nthat we passed in 1996. We worked on it for 2 years. It was very \nlaborious and it had the possibility of just falling apart right up \nuntil the end. It will probably take us a couple of years to get \nfurther comprehensive telecommunications reform done. In the meantime, \nwe should have in place a moratorium on taxing the Internet. In fact, I \nbelieve there is an overwhelming majority that agrees. We saw the vote \nyesterday. I know that was not a vote on the substance, but anytime \naround here of late that there is a vote of 74 to 11 to go to the \nsubstance of a bill, that is pretty strong.\n  I believe most Senators want to get this moratorium in place. Could \nwe tinker with it here or there? Surely, and there will be legitimate \namendments that we should consider.\n  We are on the legislation now. We can begin the amendment process. We \nhave had a relevant amendment. Senator Alexander, the opponents, were \nreasonable and have allowed us to do this. They are going to have some \nreally good and tough amendments that we are going to have to deal \nwith, and that is the way the legislative process is supposed to work, \nI think. To have voted against proceeding to this bill at all would \nhave been it. The year would have been over if we could not get on the \nsubstance of a bill of this nature with such a strong majority being in \nfavor of getting results.\n  So the 4-year moratorium that is in this proposal that makes Internet \naccess 100-percent tax free, while taking care to narrow the definition \nof Internet access to ensure that traditional telephone service is not \nincluded and while excluding voice over Internet protocol, is the right \nway to go. The Commerce Committee is already beginning to have hearings \non comprehensive telecom legislation, and that will be the appropriate \nplace to address matters such as voice over Internet protocol.\n  Senator Sununu has introduced legislation on VOIP, or voice over \nInternet protocol. We should not address that until we know exactly \nwhat we are doing. Certainly, we should not be saying that taxes are \ngoing to begin to be assessed in this area until we have thought it \nthrough. The compromise does grandfather States that taxed Internet \naccess prior to the 1998 Internet Tax Freedom Act, and there are some \n10 or 11 States that are in that category. This legislation would \nextend that grandfather status for 3 more years. For a 2-year period, \nit grandfathers the States that currently tax Internet access but were \nnot protected under the 1998 grandfather clause.\n  So that is an oversimplification, but basically the rest of the bill \njust incorporates the common components between the two bills that were \npending, the Alexander bill and the Allen bill. We should go forward \nwith this legislation. We should get the job done.\n  What is happening once again is that while we have had one amendment \nthat is germane to the substance, we now have an energy amendment being \noffered to the Internet tax moratorium. We hear there will be other \nnongermane amendments. This is the Senate. That is the way we do \nbusiness, but we have work to do. We all agree this is something we \nwant to do in a bipartisan way. My colleagues should take their shot or \ntake their shots but make them count, and let's not get hung up on this \nlegislation and drag it out with nongermane killer or poison \namendments, because it will wind up killing or doing great damage to \nwhat I think is a reasonable compromise.\n  Again, I understand the Senate rules very well. My colleagues can \noffer anything on any subject at any time, unless there is agreement to \nthe contrary. So Senators on both sides can dump their outbasket on \nthis bill, but that would be a mistake. I do not believe the leadership \non either side wants that to happen.\n\n  The best thing that could happen is for the Senators to get this off \nof our agenda right now. Let's get it off our backs. My colleagues \nwould like to be able to vote both ways, or not be able to vote at all. \nWe cannot do that because the moratorium has already ended and there \nare a lot of innovative people out there thinking of ways to tax \nInternet access.\n  Before my colleagues vote to allow a tax on the Internet, they should \ncheck with their children. If my colleagues have teenagers or kids in \ncollege, they will tear their head off. They do not want this \ninterconnection to the Internet to be taxed, and if we were to go \naround and ask Senators if they want that, no, we do not want that. \nLet's vote on this issue. Let's deal with the substantive amendments \nand the germane amendments, if my colleagues want to offer a couple of \nrelevant amendments.\n  I plead with the Senate, do not make this a punching bag because, if \nwe do, we are going to show once again that we are incompetent to \nproduce anything.\n  We did a pension bill. We saw we could do it. It still may not be \nperfect, but we got it done. This is one of those issues that is \nbipartisan. We need to get it done, and we need to get it done this \nweek. I hope my colleagues will join in finding a way to make that \nhappen.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the amendment that has been offered a few \nmoments ago by my colleague Senator Daschle is not some mysterious \namendment. It is not some amendment that was offered under some \nmysterious procedure. This is the way the\n\n[[Page S4408]]\n\nSenate allows amendments to be offered.\n  Senator Daschle has offered an amendment that deals with the subject \nof energy, and specifically renewable fuels. My colleague from \nMississippi, Senator Lott, indicated that it is the way the Senate can \ndo business. He is absolutely correct about that. The rules allow this \namendment to be offered. However, I point out that the Senate really \ndoes not do business much anymore. We are not voting much. We are kind \nof at parade rest. If there was a ``gone fishing'' sign, it would long \nago have been hung on all three doors of the Senate.\n  There is very little activity in the Senate. Very little is \nhappening. I expect that is one of the reasons my colleague offered \nthis amendment to this bill.\n  I will talk for a moment about the Energy bill. The Senator from \nMississippi and the Senator from South Dakota both indicated that we \nought to have an energy policy, and indeed we should. I was a conferee \non the Energy bill. I signed the conference report, much to the \nconsternation of some of my friends, because I thought on the whole it \nadvanced our country's interest in energy.\n  It was not perfect. There were some things in it I did not like much, \nbut the fact is, it came to the Senate floor and it lost by two votes. \nEveryone in this Chamber understands why it lost. It lost by two votes \nbecause the White House and the majority over in the House of \nRepresentatives decided to put in a retroactive waiver for liability of \nMTBE. They stubbornly persisted and demanded it be part of the bill \neven when they were told it was likely to kill the bill.\n\n  They preferred the bill die rather than take out that provision, the \nprovision that was a favoritism provision for a few enterprises. So the \nbill died. Now they want to blame others for the death of that energy \nbill. It does not wash. That energy bill died on the Senate floor, lost \nby two votes, because there were some that stubbornly persisted in \nputting a favor in that bill for some of their friends and they would \nnot back away from it. So they lost the bill. They were willing to let \nthe bill go down because of that.\n  For example, that bill contained important provisions that I thought \nadvanced the country's interests: production incentives, conservation, \nan efficiency title, a renewable fuels title. I will talk for a moment \nabout the renewable fuels title because that is the subject of Senator \nDaschle's amendment.\n  I think the renewal fuels title is very important and advances this \ncountry's interests. I am a strong supporter of it. Incidentally, I \nwill support this amendment, and I hope we get a vote on this \namendment. It does not do damage to the underlying bill at all. We can, \nshould, and will, in my judgment, have a vote on this amendment.\n  If we are not going to do a big energy bill, if instead of this week \nhaving energy on the Senate floor, which I would have preferred, we \nhave the underlying Internet tax bill, if the priority is always going \nto be something other than an energy bill for the majority leader, then \nwe have no choice but to take provisions of this energy bill that we \nthink advances this country's interests, bring it to the Senate floor, \nand see if we can legislate on it.\n  I will now talk about the renewable fuels provision. The renewable \nfuels provision is pretty simple. Drive to the gas pump this afternoon \nand see what is going on. We used to see 55 percent of our oil came \nfrom off of our shores. It is now 60 percent. Sixty percent of the oil \nevery single day that we use in this country comes from other parts of \nthe world, much of it very troubled.\n  We are putting this country at great risk if we do not understand \nthat endangers this country's economy, that endangers the opportunity \nfor us to expand, grow, and promote opportunity in the future. Yet \npeople seem oblivious to it. They say it is 60 percent coming from \noffshore, from Saudi Arabia, from Iraq, from Venezuela, from Kuwait, so \nwhat? Well, I think many of us understand the so what.\n  This country's economy, this country's well-being in the future, is \nheld hostage by others, some of whom wish this country ill. In the new \nage of terrorism, we would be well advised to understand that this \nexcessive and growing dependence on foreign sources of oil, foreign oil \nspecifically, is very dangerous to this country.\n  My colleague offers an amendment that says at least one part of the \nEnergy bill dealing with renewable fuels allows us to increase supply \nof energy in this country in a very significant way that is not only \nfriendly to the environment but allows us to grow some energy in \nAmerica's fields. It allows us to be innovative in creating new forms \nof energy to extend America's energy supply. Let me use ethanol as an \nexample. Incidentally, let me say, for those who have heartburn over \nthe offering of this amendment, 69 Senators have already voted for this \namendment. This will not be a big problem if you just allow us to have \nthe vote, put it on the bill. If the bill gets signed by the President, \nwe have at least advanced this portion of the Energy bill.\n\n  But let me talk for a moment about ethanol. The ability to take the \ndrop of ethanol from a kernel of corn and have the protein feedstock \nleft and use that drop of alcohol to extend America's energy supply--\ngood for us. That is called renewable energy. It expands the supply of \nenergy. It means we can grow our energy in our fields.\n  We have a prodigious appetite for energy in our country. As all of us \nknow, when the price of energy goes way up, the price of gasoline at \nthe pumps continues to increase relentlessly, and we know we have to do \nsomething. It ought to be a warning sign.\n  My colleague brings to the floor of the Senate a sensible, thoughtful \nprovision that had wide bipartisan support in this Chamber. What he \nsays is pretty simple. He says if it is the case that we didn't have \nenergy on the floor last month, last week, this week, next month, or \neven this summer, if that is the case, if that is what the majority \nwishes to do, to not put the Energy bill back on the Senate floor and \nallow us to work on that to get a good energy bill, then at least let's \ntake portions of the bill that we know had strong bipartisan support \nand move that because that will strengthen this country.\n  Once again, let me say to those who counsel let's wait, let's just \nwait, the question is, Wait for what? Wait for fall? Wait for October? \nWait for September? Nobody else is waiting. The price of gasoline is \nnot waiting. The threat to our supply of oil is not waiting.\n  Read yesterday's newspapers about terrorists who want to interrupt \nthe supply of oil. They are not waiting. Why should we wait to \nconstruct a sensible energy policy for this country's future? Why \nshould we wait, above all, to move forward a provision that has strong, \nbroad bipartisan support in this Chamber?\n  This is not the time to wait. This is time for us to move forward and \nunderstand that our economy, our Nation is at peril with respect to an \nenergy supply if we do not advance those portions of the Energy bill \nthat strengthen this country.\n  I, for example, believe we ought to advance the conservation title \nand we ought to advance the efficiency title, both of which are very \nimportant. My colleague offers, I think, perhaps the easiest and \nperhaps the most important provision dealing with renewable fuels. The \neasiest why? Because almost three-fourths of the Senate agree with it. \nYet the amendment gets offered and we will have people walking around \nhere choking on it. Nobody ought to choke on this amendment. The Senate \nought to agree that this amendment makes sense. This amendment has \npreviously been agreed to. This amendment advances this country's \nenergy interests. We ought to agree to this amendment. Not yesterday, \nnot tomorrow--now. This is not heavy lifting.\n  The only thing that is difficult in this Senate these days is that we \nare not doing anything. We face some real serious challenges in this \ncountry. We have an economy in trouble. We have energy problems. We are \ninvolved in a war in Iraq and a war in Afghanistan. We are beset by the \nterrorist threat. The fact is, this place is at parade rest. So my \ncolleague Senator Daschle comes to the Senate floor and offers \nsomething that says, let's move on this subject; let's step forward; \nlet's do the right thing; let's vote; let's advance this country's \nenergy supply by passing the renewable fuels section of the Energy \nbill.\n  I understand. I managed the bill on this side on the Internet tax \nissue. I\n\n[[Page S4409]]\n\nunderstand this is inconvenient, but inconvenience is a small price to \npay, incidentally, for advancing that important portion of this energy \nbill. I commend Senator Daschle for offering this, and I will strongly \nsupport it and hope we can move it quickly.\n  Let me just say as one person who is managing this on the floor of \nthe Senate--I can't speak for the majority, but let me speak for the \nminority managing this--this should not take much time at all. My guess \nis Senator Daschle would agree to a very short time limit on debate. We \nhave already debated this particular issue and had votes on it, so this \nshould not interrupt us more than 30 minutes or an hour, after which we \nwill have expressed ourselves as a Senate to move a very important \npiece of this energy bill--the renewable fuels portion of the Energy \nbill--forward with this legislation.\n  My hope is that is what we will decide to do. There is a possibility, \nhowever, that what happens the minute someone offers an amendment like \nthis is this place goes into some sort of apoplectic seizure; it shuts \ndown; we go into a quorum call. Why? Because people want to gnash and \nwipe their brow and wring their hands and fret on what to do because \nthey can't deal with this. The way to do it is to put it up for a vote, \nhave about 70 Senators vote for it, and add it to this underlying \nlegislation, so that in the end we will have this important piece of \nthe Energy bill for the American people. That will be good for this \ncountry and good for the American people, and when we have done it, I \nwill say good for the American Senate as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have the highest regard for the \ndistinguished junior Senator from Mississippi, Senator Lott, but on \nthis issue I disagree with him. I believe we have to move forward on \nenergy legislation any way we can. If it is piecemeal, let's do that. \nThe people of the State of Nevada are suffering from high gasoline \nprices. We have the second or third highest gas prices in all America.\n  For example, the bill we are going to take up next week, the FSC \nbill, in that bill I think very importantly the managers of that bill \nadded to that some very important tax provisions that deal with energy. \nThere are some short-term solutions I will speak to briefly, but there \nare some long-term solutions we must address.\n  Senators Baucus and Grassley in the FSC bill address that. What have \nthey done? They have provided tax credits for alternative energy. The \ntax credit for wind has expired. They are going to add, if we pass that \nlegislation, a tax credit for solar, a tax credit for geothermal. This \nis the solution to the energy problems we have in this country. It will \nhappen. It is only a question of time, when it is to happen. We need \nnot depend forever on the vagaries of what OPEC does. We have to depend \non what we can do.\n  People come to this Senate floor and say we need to produce our way \nout of the problem we have. We cannot do that. The United States has, \neven counting ANWR, less than 3 percent of the entire oil reserves in \nthe world. Ninety-seven percent-plus of the oil is someplace other than \nthe United States. So it is common sense that we cannot produce our way \nout of the problems we have today. We can do some things with the oil \nthat we do have. We can make it better. We can have some of our smaller \nproducing wells produce a little more. We can do some with exploration. \nBut the answer is not that. We cannot produce our way out of the \nproblems we have with oil.\n  So what can we do? The one thing we can do is do something with \nalternative energy. The Nevada test site in the deserts of Nevada has \nbeen the site for almost 1,000 nuclear explosions, some above the \nground, some below the ground. At the Nevada test site, if you put \nsolar panels on the Nevada test site you could produce enough \nelectricity to serve the entire United States. The Nevada test site \nwith solar panels could produce enough electricity to satisfy all the \nneeds of this country.\n  We know that wind energy is doing very well. In the Midwest there are \nsome farmers making more money on their windmills producing electricity \nthan they are from the crops they produce. We know that Nevada has been \nsaid to be the Saudi Arabia of geothermal. We have, not unlimited, but \nhuge amounts of geothermal power in the State of Nevada. You can drive \nplaces in Nevada and see steam coming out of the ground naturally. It \nis because of geothermal. Some wells have been tapped. The problem with \ntapping the resources we have with geothermal is the people have no tax \ncredits to do it like they had for wind. If we did that, there would be \nimmediately, in Nevada, a tremendous surge in the production of \nelectricity which would feed our state, California, and other parts of \nthe West with badly needed electricity. There would not be any \npollution. The same, of course, applies to solar. So we need to do \nthat.\n  There are some other solutions to problems we have. Of course, among \nthe long-term solutions I did mention is more fuel-efficient vehicles. \nWe certainly need to do a better job in that regard.\n  In recent years, there have been two major releases of oil from the \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve--during the Clinton years and during the \nfirst Bush years. It was done because it brought down the price of oil.\n  For example, in January 16, 1991, there was a decision made to \nrelease oil from our petroleum reserve. The next day crude oil prices \nfell from $32 to $21 a barrel. Of course, it dropped. We have done it \non two separate occasions--during the Clinton years and the first Bush \nyears. It made a difference.\n  A second release occurred. After that second release, within a week \nof the time the Strategic Petroleum Reserve was being used, the price \nof oil dropped from $37 to $31 per barrel.\n  Right now the price of oil is near $40 a barrel. Why doesn't the \nPresident release this oil from the petroleum reserve? I don't know. I \nknow one thing. It would certainly be a help if that happened. It would \nincrease the supply in this country. As supply is increased, we would \nhave a lessening of prices.\n  The other thing which I think is extremely important is that we \nrecognize there are other ways of bringing down the cost of oil. One \nthing the President could do is use his bully pulpit and his influence, \nwhich we understand is significant with the Saudis. Bob Woodward just \npublished a book that said they knew about the war before anybody in \nthe Congress knew about it.\n  Also, of course, we have been told the President has been assured \nthat in September they will start releasing more oil. That will also \nbring down the cost of oil. I suggest rather than waiting until this \nfall the President do something now to pressure the Saudis into \nreleasing more oil. They have cut by 10 percent their production of oil \nwhich began on April 1.\n  These countries are supposed to be our friends. We have young \nAmericans giving their lives in Iraq right now to make that part of the \nworld safer and more stable. It doesn't seem right the Saudis and other \nOPEC nations are not recognizing what we are doing for them.\n  We also know there are other things that can happen. The bill that \nwas defeated on the Senate floor last year had a lot of problems with \nit. Senator McCain referred to it as a ``hooters and polluters'' bill \nbecause of all of the ornaments that have been attached to the so-\ncalled ``Christmas tree.''\n  There are things which we need to do. People have said, Well, these \nthings the President can do now do not matter. Getting the Saudis to \nincrease the supply of oil would matter and, of course, having more oil \ncome out of our strategic reserve would matter. The other thing the \nPresident could do is say let us stop buying oil to be put in the SPR \nright now. Some analysts suggest prices will only go down by 10 to 20 \ncents a gallon. That is significant.\n  In Nevada where the prices are approaching $2.50 a gallon, it seems \nto me that would be a help. Anything would help. As far as I am \nconcerned, that is a good enough reason to do it.\n  Consumers need immediate relief. We are talking about as much as a \nmillion barrels of oil a week. That is about how much we put in the SPR \nwhich we are buying from the OPEC nations when they cranked up the \nprice of oil. It doesn't make sense to do that. This isn't the huge \nsupply of oil that comes into this country on a weekly base, but it \nstill is a lot. It will make a difference.\n  The latest price spike in Nevada was caused, they say, by the \nshutting down of the refinery in northern California\n\n[[Page S4410]]\n\nwhich produces only 165,000 barrels of oil a day, or 1.5 million \nbarrels a week. If that is the case, that is the same amount of oil we \nare buying from OPEC to put in the SPR. That logically would indicate \nthe price should come down.\n  I think if we are going to do anything for energy in this country, we \nhave to take it piecemeal: Do ethanol, and do what we are going to do \nnext week with the legislation that has been crafted by Senators \nGrassley and Baucus to give tax credits to the people who will produce \ngood, clean energy.\n\n  The President in his State of the Union message said he wanted to \nmove to a hydrogen economy. If we are going to depend on a hydrogen \neconomy, we have to do something about producing hydrogen and use \nsomething other than fossil fuel to produce it, which only compounds \nthe pollution. The only way you can have a hydrogen economy is produce \nthe hydrogen by using alternative energy--sun, wind, or geothermal.\n  I hope we can, as Senator Dorgan has indicated, move forward very \nquickly and dispose of this legislation. If people vote the way they \ndid the last time, this should go away very quickly. For people who \nsay, I voted for it once, I am not going to this time because it is \ndifferent form and it is stand alone, it seems to me it should be \neasier to do it that way than when it was in the bill which had so many \ndifferent problems.\n  I commend and applaud the Senator from South Dakota for moving this \nparticular piece of legislation which will improve the energy needs of \nthis country.\n  I hope we look long term and do things other than what we have been \ndoing; that is, try to produce our way out of the situation that is so \ndesperate for the people in Nevada who have the third or fourth highest \ngas prices in America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be added as a \ncosponsor of the amendment offered by Senator Daschle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of this \namendment. I have listened to the arguments propounded by the Senator \nfrom Mississippi in reference to this amendment.\n  First, we shouldn't shy away from this amendment for fear of being \noverworked. It was announced at our luncheon today we have had exactly \n11 votes in the last 4 weeks in the Senate. There is certainly room for \nmore activity here, and certainly activity should be focusing on \nimportant national issues such as energy.\n  Energy security is important for our Nation's future and it is a \ncritical part of our foreign policy. Make no mistake: Our focus on the \nMiddle East is about a lot of different issues, but it certainly is \nabout the issue of energy and its future and America's dependence on \nexternal sources for its energy. That dependence has led to some \nterrible circumstances.\n  We are faced in the Midwest and across the Nation with high gasoline \nprices. In the city of Chicago and across the State of Illinois and all \naround our Nation, we are seeing gasoline prices reach record highs. If \nyou ask why is this situation, I am afraid to say the culprit is very \nobvious: OPEC, the oil cartel in the Middle East, has decided to \nrestrict the flow and supply of oil to the United States. By cutting \noff supply, demand forces the price up. They know that. We are, \nfrankly, at their mercy.\n  Interestingly, during the last Presidential campaign when Governor \nBush of Texas was running against Vice President Gore, he said at one \npoint if he faced that situation as President of the United States he \nwould take direct action against OPEC to bring down their prices and \nforce them to supply oil to the United States. And yet weeks have gone \nby and none of that has occurred. In fact, businesses and families and \nworkers all across the Nation are being held captive by the OPEC oil \ncartel.\n  Isn't it ironic that at the same moment we have sent over 100,000 \nAmericans to risk their lives for security and stability in the Middle \nEast, at a time when we are placing our military in the Middle East to \nstabilize it for many of these oil-producing countries, they have \nturned on us and said despite our jobless recovery and despite our \nrecession they are going to restrict the flow of oil to the United \nStates, knowing full well the hardship which it creates.\n  If Bob Woodward is accurate in his book, it is scandalous to believe \nthe Saudis are doing this with the understanding that at some time \nbefore the election they will start sending more oil to the United \nStates so gasoline prices will come down and benefit the current \nadministration. That is what has been stated.\n  Prince Bandar, the ubiquitous diplomat in Washington, was the one who \nwas brought in by this administration to be forewarned about the \ninvasion of Iraq even before Members of Congress. He is such an \nimportant diplomat and international businessman that the \nadministration felt his counsel was more important than the counsel of \nMembers of Congress of both political parties.\n  If Mr. Woodward is correct in his assertions in his book, that there \nhas been some sort of an agreement that the price of gasoline is going \nto go up, creating some discomfort, but come down just in time for an \nelection surprise, an October surprise, that is awful; it is really \nunfair to the American people.\n  Why do we bring this amendment to the floor today? Well, Senator \nDaschle and Senator Dorgan, as well as Senator Reid of Nevada, have \nmade the case that this is a part of the Energy bill which we can pass \ntoday. We can pass it with a limited amount of debate and with an \noverwhelming, bipartisan rollcall, reflecting the support which alcohol \nfuels have in the Congress.\n  We know this fuel source is good for America. First, it is homegrown. \nWe do not have to depend on foreign companies and foreign nations to \nbefriend the United States.\n  We can grow the corn and other feedstocks that are necessary to make \nethanol.\n  Second, it is definitely going to be an improvement on the \nenvironment. We know that by using alcohol fuels, we reduce pollution, \nwhich is a very positive thing.\n  Third, from a selfish point of view of the Corn Belt, we know that as \nmore demand for corn is created by more production of ethanol, the \nprice of corn goes up, farm incomes go up, and Federal payments go \ndown. So it is a positive effect from three different perspectives.\n  Some argue we are making a mistake by trying to go at this one issue \nat a time; rather, we should bring the whole Energy bill before us. I \nsaw Senator Domenici from New Mexico on the floor a few moments ago. No \none has worked harder on this bill than Senator Domenici. I know his \nbitter disappointment when the bill failed by two votes, with \nbipartisan opposition, last December. I was one of the Senators who \nvoted against it.\n  There were many provisions of that bill which I support, including \nthe ethanol provision. But, frankly, at the end of the process, the \nEnergy bill had become a dog's breakfast. It turned out to be a \nsmorgasbord of special interest groups. They went out and included \nprovisions in that energy bill which were nothing short of scandalous.\n  Senator Maria Cantwell from the State of Washington came to the floor \nand echoed an earlier comment made by Senator John McCain--Senator \nCantwell, a Democrat; Senator McCain, a Republican--in which they said \nthis bill had been dominated by hooters, polluters, and corporate \nlooters. Now, it is a great phrase. When you parse it, you understand \nwhat they are talking about.\n  Imagine, the Energy bill we were being asked to vote for included a \nprovision helping someone in the State of Louisiana build a strip mall \nfor a Hooters restaurant. Now, I have never been lucky enough to go in \na Hooters restaurant. I am sure there is a great deal of energy in a \nHooters restaurant. I cannot believe it is the key to America's energy \nfuture. But it was part of that bill.\n  When it came to the polluters, take a look at the assessment of \nenvironmental groups of the Energy bill, which we rejected. Almost to a \nperson, these environmental groups said we were relaxing standards when \nit came to air pollution; we were turning our back on sound energy \npolicy coupled with sound environmental policy.\n\n[[Page S4411]]\n\n  When it came to the corporate looters, whether you are dealing with \nelectricity or oil, I think it is obvious. As we debate today this \nenergy issue, across the street from us, in the Supreme Court, they are \nweighing the arguments in a case that has been brought against the \nBush-Cheney administration, a case brought by groups that believe there \nshould be full disclosure of the special interests that came to the \ntable, the outside special interest groups that helped to write the \nEnergy bill.\n\n  The Bush-Cheney administration--particularly Vice President Cheney--\nhas been so adamant to continue to conceal and keep secret the sources \nof information which led to that energy bill that the case has gone all \nthe way to the U.S. Supreme Court. That is, frankly, because many of \nthose who came to the table must be a great embarrassment to this \nadministration. It has been said, it has been admitted by some, that \nEnron--and those were the glory days when Enron was still close friends \nwith the White House--Enron was in on the writing of this energy bill. \nIt is no surprise. Just read the bill. It was a bill that, frankly, had \ntoo many of those special interest groups writing too many provisions.\n  So here we come today with a proposal by Senator Daschle which is \nlong overdue. It tends to take away all of the chaff and leave the \nwheat.\n  Let's go to the important part of the Energy bill where there is \nbipartisan consensus. Thank goodness we no longer have to labor with \nthose provisions which provided a sweetheart deal for the producers of \nMTBE. MTBE is a fuel additive that has been put in gasoline for over 20 \nyears in order to make engines run smoother. But over 20 years ago, \nthey discovered that MTBE might work in your engine, but outside it was \ndangerous to the environment. It is not biodegradable. So if MTBE \nshould leak from an underground fuel tank and get into the water supply \nof an individual with a well or a town that relies on an aquifer, it \ncould make the water undrinkable and, in fact, potentially dangerous to \npublic health.\n  European studies link MTBE contamination to the cancer-causing agents \nwhich, frankly, we are finding too often in our environment.\n  So the producers of MTBE knew about this problem in 1984, continued \nto sell the product, and now communities across America are being \ninundated with MTBE pollution.\n  In my State of Illinois, over 25 villages and towns have MTBE \ncontamination. Over 200,000 people in my State live in an area where \nthey are trying to cope with MTBE contamination of their water supply--\na danger to families, a danger to businesses.\n  So what did this energy bill say? Along came a provision in the \nEnergy bill which said the producers of MTBE, unlike any other company \nin the United States of America, should not be held accountable in \ncourt for their wrongdoing. If they knowingly sold a toxic and \ndangerous product, which caused damage to an individual, to their \nhealth, then, frankly, the Energy bill said: We are going to give them \na pass. We are going to say they cannot be held accountable in court. \nLet the individuals bear the burden of the cost of the medical bills \nand cleaning up their water supply. Let the villages and towns pay the \nmillions of dollars necessary to overcome MTBE contamination.\n  That is the reason I voted against that energy bill. I went back to \nIllinois to a meeting of my Illinois Farm Bureau, a group that was very \nstrong for this ethanol provision, and it was a cool reception. They \nwanted to know why, after some 20 years on Capitol Hill, I turned my \nback on ethanol.\n\n  Well, I told them. I am still for ethanol. I still believe in it. I \nsupport this amendment. But I do not believe in the special interest \nfavors that were included in that energy bill. They understood. Many of \nthose same farmers came to me afterward and said: We understand \ncompletely. You ought to clean up that bill. You ought to pass the good \nprovisions that are good for America and get rid of the rest of that \nmess.\n  Well, we are trying to do that today. Senator Daschle's leadership \nhas brought an important part of this bill forward. Ethanol is not just \nan American homegrown energy source; in my part of the world, ethanol \nis a job source, and we desperately need jobs in America. We have lost \nover 2 million jobs under the Bush-Cheney administration. We have lost \nhundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs just in the State of \nIllinois. Ethanol plants being built around the Midwest, around the \nNation, will create good-paying jobs in rural areas, something we \ndesperately need. I think it is important we do it.\n  For those who say, ``Well, why don't we wait until later,'' we cannot \nafford to wait. The highway bill, which should have been passed last \nyear, that would have created millions of jobs across America, has been \nstalled in this Republican Congress now for 2 straight years. The \nbattle between the White House and the Republican leadership I cannot \neven explain at this point, but for reasons that will only be known to \nthem, they have held up the passage of the highway bill at exactly the \nwrong moment, the moment when we need jobs so much in America.\n  Passage of this amendment on the ethanol provision will get us moving \ntoward more investment, more capital creation, and more production of \nethanol and construction of ethanol plants across America. That is a \npositive, not just for the Midwest but for our Nation.\n  I commend Senator Daschle. I think, frankly, we should face this \nissue. We should debate it in a timely fashion. We should vote on it. \nIf the 69 or 70-plus Senators who have stood with ethanol on a \nbipartisan basis in the past will continue to do so in the future, we \ncan make this part of this bill and send it to the President for his \nsignature, and say to those who have been waiting for some hope: When \nit comes to dealing with energy, we have an important part of this bill \nthat we have succeeded in passing.\n  Many other challenges remain on energy. We can face them, but let's \ndo the right thing. Let's adopt the Daschle ethanol amendment today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I regret that I was not here at the time \nthe Democratic leader offered his amendment. But, of course, it would \nnot have mattered really much whether I was here.\n  I wonder, since we have seen a singular lack of progress in the last \nfew months, particularly in the last few weeks--literally every piece \nof legislation, with the rarest exception, has been loaded up with \nextraneous amendments and has had to be brought down. Of course, I have \nonly been here for 18 years. That is not a long time compared to some. \nBut I have to say, I am unaccustomed to this kind of procedure where in \ngood faith we brought this bill to the floor, in good faith we voted \ncloture on the motion to proceed, and then the Democratic leader stands \nup and proposes a totally, completely, absolutely extraneous amendment, \nan entire piece of legislation, the Energy bill, which has been hard \nfought in this body many times, as an amendment on the Internet tax \nmoratorium bill, without warning, without saying what he was going to \ndo, without having the courtesy to inform me as the chairman of the \ncommittee and the manager of the bill. If he had, I would have thought, \nwell, maybe we ought to not bring it up. The temperature is 85 degrees \nin Phoenix today. It is not raining there like it is outside. Why don't \nwe just go home? Why don't we go home, relax with our constituents and \nour families and friends, rather than go through this charade of \ntelling Americans that we are legislating.\n\n  There was an old line in the cold war era. The Russians said: We \npretend to work and they pretend to pay us. Well, we pretend to work \nand we are still getting paid. We are not working. We are not doing \nanything.\n  I say to my friend the minority leader and to my friend from Nevada--\nand they are my friends--what is this all about? You know very well \nthat if an Internet moratorium is passed, an energy bill will not be \npart of it. Now we are going to go through the parliamentary charade of \nhaving somebody offer a second-degree amendment and somebody else will \ndo a substitute, and then somebody else will offer a second-degree \namendment. What am I supposed to tell my constituents, the taxpayers, \nwe are doing here in Washington?\n\n[[Page S4412]]\n\n  If I had a townhall meeting and said, yes, we had an Internet tax \nmoratorium bill, a bill that is vitally important to both sides as far \nas whether taxation is going to be imposed on transactions over the \nInternet, which some 70 or 80 percent of the American people engage in \nnow--billions of dollars--we are going to decide in a parliamentary \nfashion whether those transactions should be taxed or not taxed, and if \nso, under what circumstances--this is the third time we have revisited \nthis issue. Ten months ago we passed it.\n  The Senator from Tennessee will tell me how many hundreds of hours he \nhas devoted to this issue. The Senator from Virginia will tell me how \nmany hundreds of hours he has devoted to it. What do we do? We take up \nthe bill. We have debated it for barely 2 days. And what do we have? \nThe Energy bill as an amendment to the Internet tax moratorium bill.\n  What am I supposed to tell my constituents? I will tell you what they \nare going to say: We don't get it. That is what they are going to say: \nWe don't get it. Yes, it is important to me, Senator, whether the State \nand local governments can tax the things I buy on the Internet. Some \npeople say they should; some people say they should not. But can't you \nguys and women get together and make a decision on it so I will be \nrelieved of this lack of knowledge as to what the future holds?\n  What about all those people who are starting businesses that do \nbusiness over the Internet? What about them? I am sorry, sir, we can't \naddress this issue because we have to take up the Energy bill.\n  I certainly wouldn't say it is all about ethanol. I certainly \nwouldn't say it is about a product that we have created a market for \nwhich has absolutely, under no circumstances, any value whatsoever \nexcept to corn producers and Archer Daniels Midland and other large \nagribusinesses.\n\n  Here we go now. Here we go. The Democrats have a retreat on Friday, \nso we are not going to be here on Friday. No, we are not going to work \n5 days this week. Actually, 3, excuse me. And here we go, now we are \ngoing to spend late this afternoon jockeying back and forth.\n  I am sure there may be a headline in South Dakota that says: Senator \nDaschle fights for ethanol. I bet there will be a whole lot of press \nreleases, too, and maybe even the distinguished Senator from North \nDakota will be fighting for ethanol, too. Meanwhile, we are not \naddressing the issues that the American people care about.\n  Right now they care about whether we are going to tax the Internet. I \nurge my colleagues to tell us, all I want to know is, are we going to \nspend between now and when we go out of session at the beginning of \nOctober in this kind of back and forth?\n  My side is also guilty, I freely admit. Are we going to spend that \ntime between now and the beginning of October, when we will break to \ntake the electioneering from the floor of the Senate out to our \nrespective States, and do this or are we going to seriously legislate \nas the American people sent us here to do?\n  Obviously, I am upset because this is a bill I have been working on \nfor a long time, an issue I have been involved in for many years. \nObviously, I am upset by it. I apologize if I have offended any of my \ncolleagues. But at the same time, this has been going on now for \nmonths. This is not the first time we have done this. This is about the \n50th time, again, on both sides of the aisle. So why don't we make a \ndecision. We are going to attach the minimum wage or we are going to \nattach lawyers' fees or medical malpractice or one of these; we are \ngoing to attach them all back and forth. And we will be able to force \nvotes on it, but unfortunately, we don't legislate.\n  Why don't we make a decision? Why don't the leaders and all 100 of us \nget together and decide what we are going to do and what we are not \ngoing to do. At least the taxpayers may find some comfort in the \nknowledge that at least we would tell them what we are doing.\n  I would imagine that as we speak we will have some amendment and then \na second-degree amendment, and we will fill up the tree, which probably \nvery few living Americans understand, including Members of this body, \nbut we will consult the Parliamentarian as to how the mechanics work.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I know my colleague from Virginia wishes \nto speak on the bill, and perhaps the Senator from New Mexico does.\n  Let me say to my friend from Arizona, I understand his angst about \nthis. But this is not a new procedure. The Senator from Arizona has \nemployed the same procedure, as have I, as now does Senator Daschle \ntoday--that is, offering an amendment that does not relate to the \nunderlying legislation.\n  There is a reason that happens. The reason that happens is the \npassion one has for legislating on a specific issue that doesn't get \nresolved because someone else won't allow you to bring it and debate it \non the floor. So you offer an amendment under the rules of the Senate \nto another piece of legislation. That is what happened here. I say to \nmy colleague, he has employed the same tactic, as have I.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Never.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will be glad to recite them. I will not do it at this \nmoment. There were line-item veto amendments, motor voter, and others. \nSenator Daschle has not offered an amendment for the purpose of a \nheadline in South Dakota. I happen to support renewable fuels and \nethanol, and have for a long while. I make no apology for that, nor \nwould Senator Daschle, because I think it advances this country's \nenergy interests.\n  The reason it has to be offered now, according to Senator Daschle--\nand we all understand this--is we had an energy bill that failed here \nby two votes. I would have preferred we pass an entire energy bill in \nthis Senate. I voted for it and I signed the conference report. I \nworked with the chairman of the Energy Committee. I would have \npreferred that to pass because it had titles in four areas I supported. \nI didn't agree with a colleague who said a few minutes ago he thought \nthere were things that were unworthy and rendered it something we \nshould not have passed. There were things in the Energy bill that were \nunworthy and I didn't support, but on balance I believed it would \nadvance this country's interests. It failed by two votes in the Senate.\n  That bill contained production incentives, conservation efficiency, \nand renewable fuels. The issue of renewable fuels is not new. We have \nworked on this for a long time. If we cannot get the Energy bill, then \nwe ought to get the renewable fuels piece at least. That has such wide, \nstrong support here in the Senate. We have voted on it. I believe it \nwas 69 votes in favor of that provision. We had bipartisan, strong \nsupport for that provision.\n  So if we cannot get the Energy bill, let's at least take that which \nwill, in my judgment, be beneficial to this country's long-term \neconomic and energy interests. That is what Senator Daschle offers this \namendment for on this bill, because the other opportunities don't \nexist. If somebody said, well, let's bring an energy bill to the floor \nthis week, rather than this bill, or bring it to the floor next week--\nand I am guessing; I don't speak for Senator Daschle--he would have \nsaid let's do that, because he supports certain provisions of that \nbill, voted for it, was the author of the renewable fuels provision and \nethanol provision. So my guess is he certainly would want that to \nhappen. But because we are now told the Energy bill will take a back \nseat to this, that, and the other thing, and that it will now perhaps \nbe fall before we talk about it on the floor of the Senate, Senator \nDaschle had every right--perhaps an obligation--to come here and say: I \nhave a passion about this, let's advance this. This is an opportunity.\n\n  Again, let me say I will bet, if I do a bit of research, perhaps \nalmost all of us on the floor, with the possible exception of the \nSenator from Virginia, because he has been here fewer years--\n\n[[Page S4413]]\n\nbut I would find everybody now on the floor has offered an extraneous \namendment to pending legislation. That is not unusual. It is called for \nin the Senate rules. We face it every time we bring up a bill. What \nwould be counterproductive is if you offer an amendment that becomes \nlike throwing a wrench into the crankcase; you strip all the gears and \nshut everything down. That is trouble.\n  That is not the case here. We have already voted on this. We know \nthere is wide bipartisan support. This isn't throwing a wrench in the \ncrankcase; this is advancing a part of the Energy bill that ought to \nadvance.\n  I will repeat, you have to be completely oblivious to reality not to \nunderstand we have a serious energy problem. Part of it is going to be \nsolved by enhanced production, part by conservation, and part by \nefficiency. But another part of it is going to be solved some way, \nsomeday, somehow by a renewable fuels title that represents an \nadvancement in our ability to produce ethanol and other renewable \nfuels. We are going to do that. We can do it sooner or later. We can do \nit now or we can wait. But I submit to you this: Given what we face in \nthis world, the threat of terrorism, cutting off an energy supply to \nour country, 60 percent of our oil coming from outside of our shores, \nmuch from troubled parts of the world, we had better get the entire \nEnergy bill up and get it done. I pledge--and I think the Senator from \nNew Mexico will recognize I was a constructive part of his \ndeliberations and voted for it and signed the conference report--I will \nagain be a constructive part of those deliberations.\n  But if we are not going to get an energy bill up here, my colleague \nhas every right to come to the floor and try to advance this renewable \nfuels provision. I support that. It is an appropriate thing to do. I \ndon't believe it should impede us in any way. We can do it in a half \nhour. We know it, we know what it is, and we know what it will do for \nthis country. It cannot be suggested this somehow is going to slow down \nthis bill; it will not and it need not. The only thing that will do \nthat is if those who decide they don't want this piece of the Energy \nbill to advance decide to find a way to interrupt this amendment.\n  Having said all that, I will say again it is not about headlines for \nanybody. It is about the right of Senator Daschle to offer an amendment \nthat is important, which has already been discussed in the Senate. I \nhope the Senate will have a vote on it and pass it and move on and deal \nwith the underlying bill and pass it when we have solved the definition \nproblem. I support a moratorium, and I believe since we have had a \nmoratorium for 5 years previous, we can find a way to solve the \ndefinition problem and continue a moratorium with respect to Internet \ntaxation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I wish the Senator from Arizona were \nhere, because I would like to tell him I agree with many of the things \nhe said. I certainly did not come to the floor--in fact, I left after \nthe last vote, assuming I would not be back down here. I thought we \nwere going on with something and that his bill, which had been debated, \nalthough it had a number of small amendments--I thought it would go \nthrough here and become law. But I have to admit between that little \nvisit to my office and what I got on the phone about 25 minutes ago \nwere very different. I don't want to be accusatory; I just want to say \nthe minority leader, over a long period of time, has been in the same \npredicament we have all been in with reference to an Energy bill. He \nhas been in the same predicament regarding ethanol as we have. We \nproduced the first bill this year that had ethanol in it. As a matter \nof fact, everybody remembers that comprehensive bill was defeated by \ntwo votes in a cloture. It got 58 votes--that first one.\n  What we have is somebody has taken a piece of the Energy bill and \nattached it not directly to the McCain amendment but to the tree on the \nside, as an amendment which will fail when McCain passes. Nonetheless, \nI guess making the point that you had a vote on ethanol does somebody \nsomething.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3051 to Amendment No. 3050\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to suggest I am very pleased this \nhappened, because I now send to the desk S. 2095 as an amendment to the \nDaschle amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3051 to amendment No. 3050.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The legislative clerk continued with the reading of the amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Can the Chair give the Senator from Nevada an idea of how \nlong it would take to read the amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Parliamentarian advises the Chair that the \ninquiry is not in order while the amendment is being read.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I did not hear the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Parliamentarian advises the Chair that an \ninquiry is not in order during the reading of an amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is objection. The clerk will continue \nwith the reading of the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk continued with the reading of the amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The inquiry is not in order.\n  Mr. REID. It is not in order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The regular order is the reading of the \namendment. The clerk will continue.\n  The legislative clerk continued with the reading of the amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may not reserve the right to \nobject.\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The clerk will continue \nwith the reading of the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk continued with the reading of the amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be a \ntemporary holdup in the reading of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. I object. I don't know what ``temporary'' means.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator object if it was understood that the \nreading could continue as soon as we finish our discussion? \nTemporarily, just 5 minutes per side and then the reading will \ncontinue.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, it is my \nunderstanding the Senator from New Mexico is asking that there be 10 \nminutes of debate equally divided; following that, the reading of the \namendment will continue?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. And nothing will change.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, might I engage in a conversation with \nthe distinguished Senator from Nevada and talk for a minute and tell \nhim what is happening?\n  What I sent to the desk is a bill we will now call S. 2095, the \ncomprehensive bill that we took to the Senate floor that Senator Dorgan \nalluded to. It was H.R. 6. We heard arguments that it was too \nexpensive. This bill is no longer expensive. As a matter of fact, it is \nnegative cost. It puts money back in the Treasury.\n  We heard that Republicans could not vote for it, and some Democrats, \nbecause of MTBE. That is out of this bill. It is no longer there.\n  I went back to the drawing board, took out direct spending, the \nraising of revenue was taken out of this bill, and\n\n[[Page S4414]]\n\nit was put in another bill. So there is no raising of revenue that goes \nin this bill. It is in the tax bill that will be up next week.\n  What I came to the floor of the Senate to do, and I say this to the \ndistinguished acting leader of the minority, was to see, rather than \npiecemeal this bill, if we couldn't get an agreement that S. 2095 could \nbecome the subject matter and that we may have three or four or five \namendments to a side. That is what I propound to the Senator from \nNevada.\n  I know how strongly Senator Daschle feels about this energy bill as \nit pertains to all the items he wants, including ethanol, and all the \nother items I described. He would have no objection to any of them. \nMTBE is out of the bill. It is no longer subject to criticism because \nit costs too much. As a matter of fact, it is about as cheap a bill as \nyou can get and still get an energy bill.\n  It does a lot of exciting things. With reference to the electric \ngrid, it does great things to eliminate gridlock and to do other very \nimportant activities. I do not want to waste the time of Senator Reid \ngoing through this bill because I think he knows what we are doing and \nhe knows what he is doing.\n  I want to save this energy bill. I want to make sure everybody knows \nit is still alive and that it is good what happened here because some \ntime in the next couple of days, we are going to prove that this energy \nbill still lives. I do not intend to kill the amendment of Senator \nMcCain. That is not my purpose. I want to make sure everybody knows and \neverybody in this country knows we have a good energy bill that is \nalive, and we have the tax portion alive in another area. Frankly, I \ndid not think we could get this far. But I thank the distinguished \nminority leader for opening up this door.\n  He opened it a little bit, and I made a nice wide door and put in the \nwhole bill. That is what this is about. A little tiny piece of the bill \nyielded an opportunity to put the whole bill in here. Now all I ask is \nthat we sit down and make an agreement that this bill be looked at--I \ncould say to the distinguished Senator who spoke about a bill that had \nbeen passed some time ago, I can almost guarantee him that if he liked \nthat bill, he will much more like this bill than the one he voted for \nbefore. It is much better. It is much more streamline. It accommodates \na lot more interests, and I believe we could get an overwhelming \nmajority of votes for it.\n  I want to close by saying if there is anybody in this country who \ndoes not know there is an energy crisis, then they must have been \nsleepwalking for the last 6 months because we are in a crisis of high \norder.\n  I am offering a way to make sure we keep alive an energy bill that \nwill work.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it goes without saying, but I will say it \nagain, I have worked with Senator Domenici during my entire 18 years in \nthe Senate. During more than half of that time, he and I have worked as \nthe chairman or ranking member, as the majority of the Senate goes back \nand forth, on one of the most important subcommittees there is in the \nappropriation process, Energy and Water, so we have worked very closely \ntogether.\n  We are partners in that legislation, and he is my friend. However, on \nthis energy bill let me say this: First, today of all days is a day \nwhen the Supreme Court of the United States was hearing a most \nimportant case, a case the Vice President of the United States has \nstalled for 3\\1/2\\ years. He had meetings during the transition period \nafter President Bush and he were elected, meetings with people from the \nenergy field, oil companies, automobile manufacturers, but we are not \ncertain, people from the nuclear industry.\n  All the American people have asked for in 3\\1/2\\ years is tell us who \nthey met with, what they talked about, and when the meetings took \nplace. He has refused. Now this matter has gone to the Supreme Court, \nand that argument was held today. These were secret meetings, I guess \nis what they are, and if there was ever a time in the history of the \ncountry where we need to debate the energy crisis, as some refer to it \nopenly, it is today. The first step to that would be to find out who \nthe Vice President met with, why he met with them, what he talked \nabout, and how long the meetings took place. He has refused to do that.\n  I also say that this country has arrived at a point in time where we \nare not going to be able to do major legislation. Let me give some \nexamples with rare exception. Take, for example, the endangered species \nbill. The endangered species bill has caused problems in the State of \nNorth Dakota, and I know this because I have heard my two colleagues \nfrom North Dakota talk about the problems of the endangered species law \nin North Dakota. But it is not limited to North Dakota; the endangered \nspecies law is a problem for most States in the country. The State of \nNevada ranks 34th in the number of listings for endangered species.\n  A number of years ago Senator Baucus, Senator Chafee, Senator \nKempthorne and I tried to do a major revision of that bill. We could \nnot do it. In that same Environment and Public Works Committee, there \nwas a decision made that we needed to do something about Superfund. We \ncould not. We have tried. Senator Smith, Senator Lautenberg, and others \non that committee tried. They were at loggerheads. They could not come \nup with a major revision of that bill.\n  So the decision has been made by most legislators that the way to \nimprove the Superfund law that now exists is to improve it by bits and \npieces. The way to improve the endangered species law in this country \nis to do it by bits and pieces. The Energy bill is the same thing.\n  I say to my friend, we are not going to pass a bill that the Senator \nfrom Arizona referred to as the hooters and polluters bill. Why was it \nreferred to as the hooters and polluters bill? Well, many of us think \nit did nothing to clear up the environment. Where did the hooters come \nin? One of the ornaments attached to the Christmas tree bill was to \ngive a financial stipend to a Hooters operation some place in the \nsouthern part of this country. That is where it got its name.\n\n  We are not going to pass major legislation on energy in the near \nfuture. What we can do, though, is pass the part on which there is \ngeneral bipartisan agreement. Ethanol is an example. More than two-\nthirds of the Senate voted for that legislation. It seems to me \nentirely logical that we should dispose of that matter. It would do \nsome good to help the energy crisis we all acknowledge is in this \ncountry.\n  As I spoke about earlier today, I throw bouquets to Senators Baucus \nand Grassley for having done what they did in the recent FSC bill by \nincluding in that something that is extremely important--section 45, \nproduction tax credits for renewable resources--that expands and \nextends a credit for wind, geothermal, solar, and biomass. That is \nimportant. We should pass that measure next week. I think we are going \nto do that. We should do the ethanol bill now.\n  My friend from Arizona, the distinguished senior Senator from \nArizona, asked, What is going on in the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's times has expired.\n  Mr. REID. I ask that the Senator from Nevada be given an extra 4 \nminutes and the Senator from New Mexico be given an equal amount of \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Is it possible we could take that off the reading of \nthe amendment?\n  Mr. REID. It is possible. I will think about it after.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We would think that it would, but that is a guess, \nalthough it would be a pretty good guess.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that I be given 4 additional \nminutes, an extra 4 minutes be given to the Senator from New Mexico, \nand then we go back to reading the amendment when I finish.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, what I was saying is the Senator from \nArizona asked, What is going on in the Senate? I mean, can anyone \nimagine--and I am paraphrasing--they offered an amendment to energy on \na bill that deals with the Internet tax?\n\n[[Page S4415]]\n\n  My friend from Arizona, who is one of the most astute politicians \nthis country has ever seen, knows what is going on. We are in the \nSenate. This has been going on for more than 200 years. We have the \nright to do that. In years past, no one ever considered it anything out \nof the ordinary.\n  The problem we have in the Senate today is we do not do anything. In \nthe last 4 weeks, we have voted 11 times. Why? Because amendments are \noffered to important legislation like FSC and there is a desire to have \na vote, for example, on overtime. How much time does Senator Harkin \nwant to debate that? He will take 10 minutes and vote on it. We have \nnot been given that privilege.\n  So what is going on in the Senate today is what has gone on for 200 \nyears. The difference is, nothing is ever brought to conclusion because \npeople do not want to vote. The majority has made a decision they do \nnot want to vote, so we do not vote.\n\n  So I say to my friend from Arizona, we are doing what has been \nhistorically done in this body. Some may ask, Well, Senator Reid, why \nwould you ask this amendment be read? Because I feel that offering this \namendment of some 800 to 900 pages is only a message that says we are \ngoing to continue doing business in the Senate the way we have all year \nlong and do nothing. Everybody knows that we are not going to pass \nthis. It is the same as the endangered species. It is the same as \nSuperfund. We are not going to pass a hooters and polluters bill.\n  We can take bits and pieces out of that legislation and do some good \nfor this country. I repeat: To do the section 45 production tax credit \nwould be a tremendous boon to this country. We would be able to start \nproducing energy alternatively. It would help the capital markets. \nThere would be construction jobs. I think it is the right way to go.\n  I am disappointed that my friend from New Mexico, who has worked \nhard--as my friend from North Dakota said, no one has worked harder on \nthis energy bill than my friend from New Mexico, the distinguished \nsenior Senator, but I say to him, someone I should not be giving advice \nto because he has far more experience than I have, this bill is not \ngoing to pass. I repeat for the third time, look at what we have tried \nto do with endangered species, look what we have tried to do with \nSuperfund. Those are only two of the numerous other pieces of \nlegislation we need to work on, but let's do them piece by piece. That \nwill be my suggestion.\n  I will give some thought to taking away my objection to reading the \namendment, but I am going to give some thought to that because I think \noffering this amendment is only a way of preventing our moving forward \non this important legislation. I have spoken to the manager of this \nbill. He thinks that working with Senator McCain, the chairman of the \nCommerce Committee, that we can come up with a compromise in a \nreasonable period of time. It is totally appropriate that we dispose of \nSenator Daschle's amendment. People should vote it up or down. More \nthan two-thirds of the Senate approved it at one time. Why should that \nchange?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. First, I wish to talk about what is going on in the \nSenate. I could hardly believe my friend--and he is my friend; what he \nsaid about our working together is true, but I could hardly believe my \nears when he suggested that the Republicans are keeping us from voting \nin the Senate. I mean, I have a list of what has been going on for the \nlast 3 months. You know, it is nothing. It is not because of the \nRepublicans, but the Democrats on every issue have said they want to \nfilibuster it. We have had more clotures in the last 3 months than any \n3 months in the history of the Republic, unless there was one after \nanother on one bill of which I am unaware. So let's talk about that in \nreality.\n  Let me say to my good friend Senator Reid, if he thinks there is only \none good provision in this bill that everybody might vote for, let me \ntick off what is in this bill and ask you if you think it would be 51 \nor 61 votes for it. Let me start: Encouraging the production of \ndomestic oil without violating the environment; encouraging the \ndevelopment of more natural gas from three sources, all American; \nencourage the building of necessary infrastructure such as the Alaska \nnatural gas pipeline; encourage more renewable energy--everybody speaks \nabout it, this bill promotes it, and we can't pass it--promote energy \nefficiency; promote clean coal technology; increase R on a variety of \ntechnologies and improve our electricity grid.\n  These are the things in this bill. I don't care how big it is, how \nmany pages are in it. If the distinguished minority leader can bring up \none piece of it because it is popular, then I believe I ought to be \nentitled to bring up the rest of the bill which is also popular. \nRemember, there is no MTBE in it. If we would have brought that first \nbill here without MTBE in it, it would have already passed; we would be \nfinished. Yet this bill is more stripped down than that. Because in \naddition to MTBE not being in it, I have already told you that it \ndoesn't cost anything. I have told you the tax provisions are somewhere \nelse, and I have just given you a litany of what is in it.\n  I submit, before we are finished, if it takes all night or however \nlong you want us to be here reading it, that we will have a vote and it \nwill be a cloture on this bill and I submit there will be two of them. \nThere will be one on Senator Daschle's and one on Senator Domenici's. I \nbelieve Senator Daschle's will fail and I believe mine will pass, and \nwhat we will have is we will have the hope and have alive the idea that \na good Energy bill, which we have gone through and swept with all kinds \nof brushes to make it a bill that everybody likes, will be pending \nbefore us.\n  I am hopeful that in the process we will not have taken so much time \nthat Senator McCain can't get his bill done. I am very hopeful of that. \nI hope Senator McCain's staff understands that all I have been speaking \nof, unless we have to stay here all night and tomorrow to get this \nread, I am looking for the time, looking ahead here and figuring that \nyou can get your amendment done and we can get an important decision by \nthis institution, in light of the terrific price of gasoline, whether \nthey want an energy bill or not. That is going to be a good one to \nwatch and it will be a good one to have a vote on, I will tell you.\n  How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute 15 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. And how much does Senator Reid have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 8 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Do you want to yield our time back?\n  Mr. REID. I would like an additional 1 minute on our side with the \nsame rule in effect\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I would take 1 in addition in case you say something \nthat needs to be rebutted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. I ask the Senator from New Mexico to yield for the purpose \nof a question.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Certainly.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from New Mexico, while \nall this discussion is going on about the underlying bill, and while it \nis interesting to talk about endangered species and Supreme Court cases \nand so forth, and energy is important, clean coal and new sources of \nnatural gas are important, and oil, and a variety of other things, the \nfuel cell and so forth--at any rate, the reality is when you speak of \nendangered species, there are endangered jobs in rural America.\n  Even though this debate is on the ethanol matter, the Corn Growers \nAssociation is very much strongly in favor of making sure there is no \ntaxation on the Internet. They realize how important that is; that this \nmeasure be passed for jobs and economic growth in rural America. There \nare 35 States in the Corn Growers Association.\n  I would ask the Senator from New Mexico, what is the purpose of \nreading this title of this bill as opposed to acting on the Energy \nbill, which I consider a detour and a tangent off of the Internet \naccess tax issue, or even addressing issues from those who want to tax \nthe Internet and may want to put on some more amendments? Why do we \nhave to spend time listening to the melodious\n\n[[Page S4416]]\n\nvoice of our clerk reading off the title of your amendment?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator, I yielded to you without knowing you were \ngoing to use all the time I had remaining.\n  Mr. ALLEN. I am sorry.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. If there is anybody I would like to do that for, I \nwould do it for you, but how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 32 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator, I am going to try to answer your question when \nI get back on my feet, but I yield the floor at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senator from New Mexico has stated the \nbill he offered is not the so-called hooters and polluters bill, so \nnamed by the distinguished Senator from Arizona, but in fact it is a \nslimmed down version of that bill.\n  I ask through the Chair of my friend from New Mexico, is that, in \nfact, the case? Could you answer that yes or no? The bill that is now \nbefore the Senate is a slimmed down version of the so-called hooters \nand polluters bill?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator, I can only do that in dollars. The original \nbill cost $31-plus billion; this one costs negative $1.2 billion.\n  Mr. REID. I ask, does this bill have in it the section 45 production \ntax credit?\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. No, it does not.\n  Mr. REID. I ask my friend from New Mexico, would you support--\nsupporting your bill here, that is the one I have offered as an \namendment, would you support the FSC bill with the section 45 \nproduction tax credit in it?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Sure.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am going to, at this time, that being the \ncase, recognizing that what the Senator has offered is a slimmed down \nversion and is not the original bill, and that he would support the \nprovision in the FSC bill--I think a combination of those two might \nmake some interesting votes here in the next day or two--I withdraw my \nobjection to waiving reading the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Could the Senator tell me what you said about votes in \nthe next couple of days? I didn't get it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I know the Senator from Virginia wants to speak on the \nunderlying bill. I will be as brief as I can.\n  What I told the Senator from New Mexico, through the Chair, is that \nit was my understanding that the bill that was offered in the form of \nan amendment was nearer the original bill that was offered and cloture \nwas not invoked on it previously. I have been told by my staff and \nothers that it is a slimmed down version of the original bill. That was \nconfirmed by the Senator from New Mexico.\n  I further went on to say, to ask the Senator from New Mexico if it \nhad the section 45 production tax credit in it. He said no. I then went \nfurther and said, would he, the Senator from New Mexico, support the \nFSC bill, which does have the production tax credits in it, and he said \nhe would.\n  I then said, that being the case, that we have a smaller version of \nthe original Energy bill than I originally thought, and, further, that \nhe would support the FSC bill, including the production tax credit \nprovision that was placed in there by Senators Grassley and Baucus. I \nthen said I think that is going to make for some interesting votes in \nthe next few days.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. So you said about 2 days? I still didn't get that.\n  Mr. REID. I would assume the alternatives, I say through the Chair to \nmy friend from New Mexico. I assume the majority has a number of \nalternatives. They can debate endlessly the amendment you have offered, \nthe amendment the Senator from Arizona has offered, and we already have \ncloture having been filed on the minority leader's amendment--so it is \npossible, I don't know if the majority has made that decision, they \ncould file cloture on your amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. They could file cloture on the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Arizona. That is why I said in a couple of days. It takes 2 days \nfor these cloture motions to ripen. Maybe Thursday we could have a vote \non all these matters, and I said it would make for some interesting \nvotes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. I \ndon't quite understand, I say to both Senators. I want to help, but I \ndon't understand.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, could I ask what the parliamentary \nsituation is?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is a pending Domenici second-degree \namendment to the pending Daschle first-degree amendment to the \nunderlying text of the bill.\n  Mr. McCAIN. So we are debating the Domenici second-degree amendment \nto the Daschle amendment to the substitute or to the original S. 150.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield the floor. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I have been listening to the debate and the \nreading of titles of amendments. We have seen detours, political \nposturing, partisanship, criticizing of the Vice President, and all \nsorts of cover for past obstructionism.\n  Obviously, things such as the geothermal are important. Clean-coal \ntechnology is important. Biomass, solar photovoltaic, energy policy, \nexploration of the North Slope of Alaska, natural gas pipelines for \ngreater quantities of natural gas--all of that is very important. Then \nyou listen to people talk about endangered species. A Senator was \ntalking about endangered species. I am thinking: You know what is \nendangered in this country--particularly out in rural areas--is jobs \nfor people in rural America.\n  The main point of this debate and where we are supposed to be today \nis those who want to have the Internet free from taxation and others \nwho have other ideas. The Senator from Texas, Senator Hutchinson, had \nan amendment. We voted on it, and we are supposed to be considering \nother amendments on Internet tax. Now we are off on a tangent of \nethanol. First it was ethanol, and now it is the larger Energy bill. I \nwas thinking the key people who like the ethanol provision are people \nwho grow corn in America.\n  There is an association, the American Corn Growers Association. To \nget everyone to focus a second on the main issue, which is whether the \nInternet ought to be taxed at the State and local level, I will share \nwith my colleagues what the American Corn Growers Association actually \nthinks of S. 150, the bill to make sure there is not taxation on the \nInternet.\n  They said they support S. 150. They want to make the existing Federal \nmoratorium against State and local taxes on Internet access, as well as \nmultiple and discriminatory taxes targeting interstate commerce, \npermanent and national in scope. They feel the bill would ensure \ntechnological neutrality so all Internet users, including their \nmembers--being the corn growers--are protected by the Federal \nmoratorium no matter what technology they use to access the Internet. \nThe Corn Growers Association feels the new technologies are \nparticularly key to ensuring Internet access to rural America.\n  They are exactly right, whether that is through DSL lines, through \nwireless, satellites, or electric power lines, there are a variety of \nways rural America needs to get access to broadband.\n  The American Corn Growers Association, which represents people and \ninterests of corn producers in 35 States, works very hard to enhance \nfarm income. They care about protecting rural communities. They say \nthey recognize the need to have a strong and stable farm economy, not \njust for the farmers, but for consumers, as well. They feel the \nInternet Tax Freedom Act and S. 150 is intended to exempt access to the \nInternet from taxation, including, they recognize, transmission. The \nCorn\n\n[[Page S4417]]\n\nGrowers feel to exempt from taxation the transmission is an integral \npart of accessing the Internet. They feel failure to amend the existing \nlaw would make consumers susceptible to substantial taxation of their \nInternet access. They also say even the definition of Internet access \nis outdated and does not cover all forms of technology used to access \nthe Internet that exists today.\n  The wording of the original statute is exclusive of consideration of \nthe multiple technological advancements and changes that have developed \nin business since 1998. This is inadequate, says the Corn Growers \nAssociation, and will almost certainly result in new taxes imposed on \nInternet users. They feel keeping the current language in place will \nperpetuate a competitive disadvantage among providers by exempting some \nof the types of high-speed Internet access while other types would be \ntaxable.\n  We have the American Corn Growers Association, which undoubtedly \nwould be for ethanol provisions proposed on the floor, but clearly the \nAmerican Corn Growers Association, as well as dozens of organizations, \nwhether technologically involved or not, care a great deal about \nwhether broadband is going to be taxed.\n  All these parliamentary procedures and all these delays and tangents \nand detours take us away from the point at hand and the decision that \nneeds to be made by the Senate. It ought to be done as quickly as \npossible. The question before us is whether American consumers are \ngoing to be hit on average with 17-percent telecommunication taxes on \ntheir monthly Internet service bill. The question is whether Internet \nservice bills will look like a telephone bill, with multiple taxes from \nthe localities, from the States, and even the Federal Government.\n  My friends, it is absolutely essential, I say to my colleagues, that \nwe act on the Internet access tax issue. As more and more taxes get \nimposed, it is nearly impossible to ever get those taxes off. Look at \nyour telephone bill. There is a slew of taxes; some that are \nincomprehensible. There is one tax placed on there in 1898 as a luxury \ntax. It was a luxury tax in 1898 to finance the Spanish-American War. \nGuess what? We are still paying that tax. That war has been over for \nover 100 years.\n  That is why it is important we act and not delay, not dawdle, not get \noff on tangents. If we do get off the point, we need to get back on the \nsubject, the point of voting and taking a stand on whether Members \nstand on the side of freedom and opportunity for people by not having \nInternet access hit with 17-percent taxes or more, or whether we will \nstand on the side of freedom, where the broadband can get rolled out--\nnot just to city areas and suburban areas, but out to the country, to \nrural areas so people can have access if they have their own business, \naccess to sell goods or services all over the world, or all over the \ncountry, as the case may be.\n  If we continue to delay on this issue, we will see what has happened \nin the last 2 years. What has happened in the last 2 years, a little \nover 2 years, is unelected bureaucrats come up with revenue rulings or \ntaxation rulings that have found a loophole in the original moratorium \nand have started imposing taxes, about $40 million worth of taxes \nacross the country. That is not a great deal in money, but nevertheless \ntaxing DSL is a great concern to many. When they tax Internet access, \nthat means fewer people can afford it. The reason most people do not \nhave Internet access is they cannot afford it. We are concerned about \nan economic digital divide. If you want to close the divide and make \nsure people all over this country have greater ability to have access \nto the Internet, and the benefits therefrom--whether education, access \nto information, commerce, telemedicine, a variety of other \napplications, particularly with broadband--then we must not tax \nInternet access. Adding taxes will not help.\n  I hope we will make a decision this week. Let the American people \nknow where we stand. More importantly, let those companies that will \nhave to make investments in the range of tens of millions of dollars to \nserve various areas know what the policy of this country will be. In \nthe past, the question has been one of freedom--making sure the \nInternet was free from taxation. We see great growth, great \nopportunity. That should be the approach for the future, from my point \nof view.\n  A decision needs to be made so the folks planning expansion of the \nInternet--those companies, those entrepreneurs--know what the playing \nfield will be in the future. It is my view, looking at the votes, \nwhether on the motion to proceed or the most recent amendment from the \nsenior Senator from Texas, the vast majority of the Senators realize \nthe Internet ought to remain free from burdensome, onerous taxation. A \nmajority of the Senators recognize we need to update the definition of \nInternet access to make sure the DSL, wireless and other methods of \naccessing the Internet, are not subject to these burdensome taxes.\n  From these votes, at least in the early indications, it appears that \na majority of Senators recognizes that we ought to be closing the \neconomic digital divide. A strong majority of Senators recognizes there \nare innovations, there are new ideas, and we want to make sure this \ncountry will be in the lead for adaptations, the benefits, prosperity, \nand opportunity that will flow from new advancements in technology. We \ncertainly do not want to be increasing the costs to anybody in this \ncountry for logging on to the Internet everyday.\n  In my view, if the Senate does not act, if the Senate does not invoke \ncloture and pass an updated Federal moratorium on Internet access \ntaxation, what we will see are State and local tax commissars imposing \ntelecommunication-based taxes that average about 17 percent on the \nInternet. This moratorium that we are trying to get action on here on \nthe Senate floor is designed to protect consumers and avert the adverse \nimpact of taxation on real people in our real world and in our economy.\n\n  So while there are all these machinations and maneuverings and \nparliamentary procedures and political posturing and tangents and \ndetours, I would ask my colleagues, in the midst of this, if we are \ngoing to have votes on all these other ideas, some of which have a \ngreat deal of merit--and maybe, for those of us who do not want to tax \nthe Internet, we should feel somehow applauded or grateful that people \nwould want to attach salutary, positive ideas; they figure this is \ngoing to pass, and this is the way to get those other ideas done--but \nas you get on to these other nongermane issues, let's act on them \nquickly, and let's also keep our eye on the ball.\n  While folks may care about endangered species, let's remember, real \npeople in the real world who we want to make sure have the \nopportunities that come from having access to broadband and Internet, \nwhether they are a small business owner, a student, or somebody who is \nlooking for a better job, let's make sure we pay attention to the issue \nat hand, the underlying measure; and that is, to make sure the Internet \nstays free from onerous and burdensome taxation for all people all over \nthe United States of America.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I am kind of surprised that the Corn \nGrowers Association of America is supporting the Allen-Wyden \nlegislation. I am sure that if they really understood the ramifications \nof this legislation, they would not be supportive of it because they \nwould understand that if that legislation passes, their real estate \ntaxes or other taxes they are paying would increase.\n  I am going to make a point of getting in touch with them. I received \nthe President's Award last year from the Corn Growers, from Fred Yoder, \nwho was their president, and worked very hard, several years ago, to \nget the petroleum people and the Corn Growers together to come up with \nthe ethanol compromise that is now in the Energy bill.\n  I am glad the Senator from Virginia has pointed out they are \nsupporting this legislation. I am going to get in touch with them right \naway and share with them some information they might not have had at \nthe time they came out to support this legislation.\n  This afternoon the Senator from Arizona quoted from a policy paper of \nthe National Governors Association and mentioned the criteria that the \nNational Governors Association said\n\n[[Page S4418]]\n\nshould be in any bill that deals with this question of Internet \ntaxation. I would like to go through that policy paper and share that \nwith my colleagues in the Senate.\n  First: NGA supports, as I do and as the Presiding Officer does, \nreasonable extension of the Internet Tax Freedom Act.\n  In this policy paper that was quoted from:\n\n       The NGA calls upon Congress to adopt S. 2084, the \n     ``Internet Tax Ban Extension and Improvement Act.'' This \n     compromise bill, sponsored by Senators Alexander and Carper--\n\nand, by the way, Senator Voinovich--\n\n     offers a reasonable extension of the moratorium while \n     addressing industry concerns for technological neutrality \n     without unduly burdening state and local governments.\n\n  I am not going to go into all these, but I ask unanimous consent that \nthis policy paper be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   NGA Supports Reasonable Extension of the Internet Tax Freedom Act\n\n       The National Governors Association (NGA) supports extending \n     the federal ban on state and local taxation of Internet \n     access in a manner that is technology neutral and fiscally \n     fair to state and local governments. Unfortunately, two \n     pieces of legislation currently moving through Congress \n     violate these basic principles. The House of Representatives \n     has already passed H.R. 49 and S. 150 is currently under \n     consideration in the Senate. By permanently expanding the \n     definition of tax-free Internet access, both bills rob state \n     and local governments of existing revenues while creating a \n     tax free zone for future communications services.\n       The NGA calls upon Congress to adopt S. 2084, the \n     ``Internet Tax Ban Extension and Improvement Act.'' This \n     compromise bill, sponsored by Senators Alexander and Carper, \n     offers a reasonable extension of the moratorium while \n     addressing industry concerns for technological neutrality \n     without unduly burdening state and local governments.\n\n\n                               background\n\n       Although the U.S. Constitution grants Congress broad \n     authority to regulate interstate commerce, the federal \n     government, historically, has been reluctant to interfere \n     with states ability to raise and regulate its own revenues. \n     State tax sovereignty is a basic tenet of the federalist \n     system and is fundamental to the inherent political \n     independence and viability of states. Only in the most \n     narrowly defined exceptions has Congress crossed that line.\n       The 1998 ``Internet Tax Freedom Act'' (ITFA), which imposed \n     a moratorium on state or local taxation of Internet access, \n     is one exception to this long held practice. The ITFA expired \n     briefly in 2000 but Congress renewed it through November 1, \n     2003. Designed to ``jump start'' the then-fledgling Internet \n     industry, the moratorium included three important \n     restrictions to protect states:\n       1) it applied only to new taxes--existing taxes were \n     grandfathered;\n       2) the definition of Internet access, while broad, excluded \n     telecommunication services; and\n       3) the bill expired after two years to allow Congress, \n     states and industry the opportunity to make adjustments for \n     rapidly developing technologies and markets.\n\n\n                            the nga position\n\n       Today, over 130 million Americans access the Internet using \n     everything from dial-up modems, high-speed broadband, and \n     Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) offerings to wireless \n     technologies and even satellite and power line connections. \n     The Internet's broad reach and technological promise is also \n     transforming entire industries such as telecommunications, \n     which is rapidly migrating all of its services to Internet \n     based technologies and rolling out new services such as Voice \n     Over Internet Protocol (VOIP).\n       As Congress considers legislation to extend the moratorium, \n     NGA encourages members to adhere to the following guidelines \n     to maintain the balance struck by the original moratorium, a \n     balance that encouraged the growth of the Internet but still \n     respected state sovereignty:\n\n\n1. do no harm; any extension of the moratorium should preserve existing \n                       state and local revenues.\n\n       The original moratorium protected existing state revenues \n     by grandfathering tax laws in place before 1998 and \n     prohibiting only new taxes on Internet access. In contrast, \n     H.R. 49 and S. 150 would cost states much needed revenue by \n     repealing the grandfather clause and expanding the law to \n     prohibit taxes on telecommunications ``used to provide \n     Internet access.'' Stating that the proposed bills would \n     trigger a possible point-of-order under the Unfunded Mandates \n     Reform Act, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates \n     removing the grandfather provision would cost states between \n     $80 and $120 million annually. The effect of the second \n     provision could be even greater. ``[D]epending on how the \n     language altering the definition of what telecommunications \n     services are taxable is interpreted,'' the CBO said, ``that \n     language also could result in substantial revenue losses for \n     states.'' With state and local governments collecting over \n     $18 billion in telecommunications taxes annually, any \n     significant change in the taxability of telecommunications \n     could cost states billions of dollars. At a time when state \n     and local governments are facing large increases in mandatory \n     spending and stagnant revenue growth, Congress should not \n     exacerbate state fiscal problems by interfering with the \n     collection of existing taxes.\n\n\n                    2. be clear; definitions matter.\n\n       The original moratorium split the definition of Internet \n     access into two parts: a broad and inclusive description of \n     Internet access and an absolute exclusion of \n     telecommunications services from the moratorium. The \n     definition read:\n       ``Internet access means a service that enables users to \n     access content, information, electronic mail, or other \n     services offered over the Internet, and may also include \n     access to proprietary content, information, and other \n     services as part of a package of services offered to users. \n     Such term does not include telecommunications services.''\n       The exclusion of telecommunications services protected \n     states by clarifying that Internet access was a separate, \n     distinct and limited service. It also clearly preserved \n     existing state and local taxes on telecommunications services \n     that amounted to over $18 billion in 1999. The definition, \n     however, allowed some jurisdictions to tax the \n     telecommunications component of certain broadband \n     technologies like DSL while others remained tax-free. This \n     perceived inequity led to a push to alter the definition of \n     Internet access in H.R. 49 and S. 150 to make tax free \n     telecommunications services ``used to provide Internet \n     access,'' as a means of making the ITFA technology neutral. \n     This change, however, is too broad. Not only would it \n     prohibit taxes states and localities are collecting on DSL, \n     it would also exempt all telecommunications services used \n     anywhere along the Internet--from the end-user all the way to \n     and including the ``backbone.'' Compared to the original \n     moratorium, which expressly exempted telecommunications from \n     its scope, H.R. 49 and S. 150 could ultimately put at risk \n     most, if not all, state and local telecommunication tax \n     revenue. (See attached chart.)\n       H.R. 49 and S. 150 would also intensify a long-standing \n     problem with the original definition: the unlimited ability \n     to bundle together content and ``other services'' into a \n     single offering of tax-free Internet access. Services such as \n     VOIP highlight the risk states face from this broad \n     definition. Unlike traditional telecommunications services, \n     VOIP uses the Internet to transmit voice communications \n     between computers, phones and other communications devices. \n     Industry observers expect 40 percent of all telephone calls \n     in the United States to be Internet based within five \n     years. If VOIP is allowed to be bundled with Internet \n     access into a single tax-free offering, and \n     telecommunications used to deliver that offering are also \n     tax free, states could quickly see their \n     telecommunications tax base erode to nothing. Language in \n     S. 150 as amended and S. 2084 that requires service \n     providers to unbundled taxable services from non-taxable \n     Internet access is helpful, but only if the universe of \n     what constitutes Internet access is actually limited.\n\n\n    3. stay flexible--a temporary solution is better than permanent \n                               confusion.\n\n       Rapid pace innovation in the Internet and \n     telecommunications industries makes it difficult to define \n     accurately these complex and ever-changing services. The \n     original moratorium was made temporary in part for this \n     reason--to provide Congress, industry and state and local \n     governments with the ability to revisit the issue and make \n     adjustments where necessary to accommodate new technologies \n     and market realities. The fact that the courts, the Federal \n     Communications Commission and Congress are all in the process \n     of examining and redefining the core elements of what \n     constitutes telecommunications and Internet access \n     underscores the need for caution. With so much uncertainty, a \n     temporary extension of the moratorium is the best way to \n     avoid unintended consequences from a permanent moratorium.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       NGA supports S. 2084 because it best reflects a balance \n     between state sovereignty and federal support for the \n     Internet. First, it protects states by drawing a line in the \n     sand to prohibit new taxes on Internet without interfering \n     with existing state laws. Second, by making the connection \n     from a consumer to their Internet access provider tax free, \n     the Alexander-Carper bill actually levels the playing field \n     for competing technologies without overreaching. Third, it \n     gives Congress, industry and states a chance to revisit the \n     Act by making the moratorium expire after two years. For \n     these reasons NGA supports S. 2084 as a true compromise that \n     is fair to industry, respectful of states, and good for \n     consumers.\n\n STATE AND LOCAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS TAXES

Special Report/Viewpoint ``Telecommunications Taxes: 50-State\n  Estimates of Excess State and Local Tax Burden,'' Robert Cline, State\n  Tax Notes, June 3, 2002.\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. First, they talk about: ``DO NO HARM. Any extension of \nthe moratorium should preserve existing state and local revenues.''\n  The next point they make is: ``BE CLEAR. Definitions matter.''\n  By the way, in the area of ``DO NO HARM,'' they mention the fact:\n\n       With state and local governments collecting over $18 \n     billion in telecommunications taxes annually, any significant \n     change in the taxability of telecommunications could cost \n     states billions [billions] of dollars. At a time when state \n     and local governments are facing large increases in mandatory \n     spending and stagnant revenue growth, Congress should not \n     exacerbate state fiscal problems by interfering with the \n     collection of existing taxes.\n\n  In terms of the definitions, they believe that:\n\n       The original moratorium split the definition of Internet \n     access into two parts: a broad and inclusive description of \n     Internet access and an absolute exclusion of \n     telecommunications services from the moratorium. The \n     definition read:\n       ``Internet access means a service that enables users to \n     access content, information, electronic mail, or other \n     services offered over the Internet, and may also include \n     access to proprietary content, information, and other \n     services as part of a package of services offered to users. \n     Such term does not include telecommunications services.''\n       The exclusion of telecommunications services protected \n     states by clarifying that Internet access was a separate, \n     distinct and limited service.\n\n  They go on to say, under definitions:\n\n       [The House bill] and S. 150 would also intensify a long-\n     standing problem with the original definition: the unlimited \n     ability to bundle together content and ``other services'' \n     into a single offering of tax-free Internet access. Services \n     such as VOIP--\n\n  That is being able to use your computer to make telephone calls--\n\n       highlight the risk states face from this broad definition. \n     Unlike traditional telecommunications services, VOIP uses the \n     Internet to transmit voice communications between computers, \n     phones and other communications devices. Industry observers \n     expect 40 percent of all telephone calls in the United States \n     to be Internet based within five years. If VOIP is allowed to \n     be bundled with Internet access into a single tax-free \n     offering, and telecommunications used to deliver that \n     offering are also tax free, states could quickly see their \n     telecommunications tax base erode to nothing [nothing]. \n     Language in S. 150 as amended and S. 2084 that requires \n     service providers to unbundle taxable services from non-\n     taxable Internet access is helpful, but only if the universe \n     of what constitutes Internet access is actually limited.\n\n  It also goes on and talks about ``STAY FLEXIBLE. A temporary solution \nis better than permanent confusion.'' Did you hear that? ``A temporary \nsolution is better than permanent confusion.''\n\n       Rapid pace innovation in the Internet and \n     telecommunications industries makes it difficult to define \n     accurately these complex and ever-changing services. The \n     original moratorium was made temporary in part for \n     this reason--to provide Congress, industry and state and \n     local governments with the ability to revisit the issue \n     and make adjustments where necessary to accommodate new \n     technologies and market realities. The fact that the \n     courts, the Federal Communications Commission and Congress \n     are all in the process of examining and redefining the \n     core elements of what constitutes telecommunications and \n     Internet access underscores the need for caution.\n\n  We are in an era right now of unbelievable change.\n\n       With so much uncertainty, a temporary extension of the \n     moratorium is the best way to avoid unintended consequences \n     from a permanent moratorium.\n\n  Their final conclusion--and I am sure the Presiding Officer is very \nhappy about this--is:\n\n       NGA supports S. 2084 because it best reflects a balance \n     between state sovereignty and federal support for the \n     Internet. First, it protects states by drawing a line in the \n     sand to prohibit new taxes on Internet without interfering \n     with existing state taxes. Second, by making the connection \n     from a consumer to their Internet access provider tax free, \n     the Alexander-Carper bill actually levels the playing field \n     for competing technologies without overreaching.\n\n  That is a point that the Presiding Officer has made several times on \nthe floor of the Senate.\n  Continuing:\n\n       Third, it gives Congress, industry and states a chance to \n     revisit the Act by making the moratorium expire after two \n     years. For these reasons NGA supports S. 2084 as a true \n     compromise that is fair to industry, respectful of states, \n     and good for consumers.\n\n  Now, I contacted the National Governors Association earlier today.\n  I asked them if they could opine on the McCain amendment that was so \neloquently spoken to by Senator McCain. They worked very quickly and \ncame back with a letter to Senator Frist, majority leader, and Senator \nDaschle, Democratic leader. It is signed by Governor Brad Henry, \nOklahoma, Chair, Committee on Economic Development and Commerce, and \nGovernor Michael Rounds, South Dakota, Vice Chairman, Committee on \nEconomic Development and Commerce.\n  I would like to read from that letter.\n\n       Dear Senator Frist and Senator Daschle:\n       The National Governors Association . . . supports an \n     Internet access tax moratorium that benefits consumers, is \n     fair to industry, and does no harm to states. As the Senate \n     once again considers the moratorium, we urge you to oppose \n     efforts that would deprive states of existing tax revenues \n     and to support the compromise proposal to be offered by \n     Senator Alexander and Senator Carper and embodied in S. 2084, \n     the ``Internet Tax Ban Extension and Improvement Act.''\n       NGA supports the Alexander/Carper compromise because it \n     best reflects the appropriate balance between state \n     sovereignty and federal support for the Internet. First, it \n     protects states by prohibiting new taxes on Internet access \n     without interfering with existing state revenues. Second, by \n     making the connection from a consumer to their Internet \n     access provider tax free, the compromise language encourages \n     broadband deployment by leveling the playing field for all \n     technologies.\n\n  That is what we are trying to do. The amendment we tried to get in \nlast year and which will be offered by the Senator from Tennessee tries \nto level the playing field for all of the providers of this access.\n\n       Third, because it is temporary, it gives Congress, \n     industry, consumers, and states a chance to revisit the issue \n     and make adjustments where necessary to accommodate new \n     technologies and market realities.\n\n  Here is the paragraph that I think gets to the heart of the matter:\n\n       The recent proposal by Senator McCain, while an improvement \n     on the bill sponsored by Senator Allen and Senator Wyden . . \n     . does not go far enough to protect states. By adopting the \n     broad definition of tax-free Internet access used in S. 150--\n\n  That is the same definition that is in the Wyden-Allen bill; the same \ndefinition is in the amendment proposed by Senator McCain--\n\n     and terminating the grandfather protections before the end of \n     the moratorium, the McCain proposal would still deprive state \n     and local governments of existing tax revenues and violate \n     the principle of ``do no harm.''\n       The nation's governors call on the U.S. Senate to oppose \n     the McCain amendment and support Senator Alexander and \n     Senator Carper in their efforts to strike a reasonable \n     compromise to extend the Internet access tax moratorium.\n\n  The Senator from Tennessee, Senator Alexander, Senator Carper, and \nSenator Voinovich, who is the third sponsor of S. 2084, should be very \nhappy\n\n[[Page S4420]]\n\nwith the support we are getting from the National Governors \nAssociation. I hope our colleagues take that into consideration.\n  In addition to the letter from the National Governors Association, I \nwould like to share a letter I recently received from the Ohio \nDepartment of Taxation. In fact, I have never seen a letter from the \nDepartment of Taxation of the State of Ohio turned around so quickly in \nmy life. We faxed them the McCain proposal. We asked them to give us \ntheir opinion of the McCain amendment. I suggest to my colleagues that \nbefore they vote on this legislation, they take it upon themselves--as \na matter of fact, I think it is an obligation for them--to get in \ncontact with their State departments of taxation to get a read from \nthem about what impact this amendment would have on their respective \nStates. Some of my colleagues, frankly, are supporting this and may not \nwant to hear the impact it is having on their State. But I think it is \nincumbent upon them at least to find out what their States think about \nthis proposed legislation and the impact it would have on their \nrespective States.\n\n  I am going to read a portion of this letter. It reads:\n\n       Dear Senator Voinovich:\n       We reviewed the text of the McCain language that you FAXed \n     to us this morning. Our preliminary impression is that this \n     bill is very similar to the version of S. 150 containing the \n     ``managers amendment'' and has roughly the same negative \n     revenue impact on Ohio. Specifically, we think that the bill \n     would cause a state and local revenue loss of about $72 \n     million per year. The amount would become larger as more \n     telecommunications services are provided through Internet \n     technology and/or bundled with Internet access, and as \n     broadband Internet access is used by more households. \n     Specifically, the $72 million estimate does not account for \n     state and local revenues lost as more phone services are \n     replaced by VOIP, which we believe the McCain bill will still \n     prohibit the states from taxing (as long as VOIP is bundled \n     with Internet access).\n\n  That is the way they do it. They bundle it together and under their \ndefinition this would be exempt from taxation.\n\n       As you know, the states objected to S. 150 on several \n     grounds. One of the most important was the language ``the \n     term `Internet access' does not include telecommunications \n     services, except to the extent such services are purchased, \n     used, or sold by a provider of Internet access to provide \n     Internet access.''\n       This ``Allen-Wyden'' definition of Internet access is so \n     broad that it essentially can be used to exempt what we have \n     seen referred to as the ``Internet backbone'' \n     telecommunications services, the ``middle mile'' \n     telecommunications services, and the ``last mile'' \n     telecommunications services. This is in contrast to S2084, \n     which you cosponsored, and which would have provided a much \n     more limited exemption for last mile telecommunications \n     services that are used to connect an end-user (e.g. \n     household) to an Internet service provider such as AOL or \n     Earthlink or Comcast.\n\n  That is the thing we don't want. We want people to have to plug into \nthat mile, but the thing we are concerned about is they want to go \nbeyond that. They want to take in the whole watermelon.\n\n       In Ohio, the impact of the S. 150 moratorium on state and \n     local taxation of all these telecommunications services may \n     not be as damaging as in some other states because Ohio \n     already has a broad exemption for the purchase of property \n     used in providing telecommunications services. Even so, we \n     still estimate that the annual full-year loss to Ohio from \n     the provision would be about $72 million.\n       Another notable provision of the McCain bill is the \n     exception of VOIP services from the tax moratorium. To the \n     extent that such service mimics traditional telephone \n     service, we believe that this means that State and local \n     governments would be allowed to tax VOIP services insofar as \n     they mimic traditional telephone services. The so-called VOIP \n     exception to the moratorium actually does nothing for the \n     states' ability to tax that or similar services that may \n     migrate to the Internet. Current Ohio law allows state and \n     local governments to tax VOIP as a telecommunications \n     service, as long as there is no federal preemption.\n       The McCain ``exception'' to the federal preemption does not \n     apply to services that are defined as Internet access. This \n     means that the exemption will not apply to voice services \n     that are bundled with Internet access, and since that is how \n     VOIP services are currently sold and probably will continue \n     to be sold, the exception in the McCain bill will in fact \n     provide no protection against states losing revenues as phone \n     services migrate to VOIP.\n\n  The Senator from Tennessee, the Presiding Officer, has made it very \nclear if there was an amendment to that bill that made it very clear \nthat could continue to be taxed, that might remedy this whole issue.\n  The letter goes on to say:\n\n       We do not know exactly how much revenues will be lost in \n     the future due to the migration of currently taxable phone \n     service to exempt VOIP service, but it could end up being \n     most of Ohio's telecommunications tax revenues.\n\n  I'll read that again:\n\n       We do not know exactly how much revenue will be lost in the \n     future due to the migration of current taxable phone service \n     to exempt VOIP service, but it could end up being most of \n     Ohio's telecommunications tax revenues.\n\n  You know if that happens, the State is either going to reduce \nservices or they are going to find something else to tax. That is the \nway this thing operates.\n  The letter concludes:\n\n       To put the estimated $72 million loss in context, in fiscal \n     year 2003, Ohio collected about $250 million in sales tax and \n     use tax from telecommunications service providers. The most \n     recent biennial budget bill switched local telephone \n     providers from the old gross receipts tax to the sales tax \n     and use tax, so that now the forecasted full year sales and \n     use tax revenue from all telecommunications providers is \n     about $370 million. This is at a 5 percent state tax rate--we \n     are ignoring the current 6 percent tax rate because it is set \n     to expire. . . .Thus, the estimated revenue loss from the \n     McCain bill (excluding the VOIP loss) is slightly less than \n     20 percent of total estimated Ohio telecommunications sales \n     tax revenues.\n\n  The fact is the McCain amendment is going to have a devastating \nimpact on the revenues of our States and goes far beyond the moratorium \nI helped negotiate when I was chairman of the National Governors \nAssociation, and is something we should all be concerned about.\n  I also want to make another couple of points, if I may. I have heard \nso much today already and in the past about the fact that if we don't \nget this done, everything is going to stop and it is going to be a \nterrible thing for farmers and all Americans, and so on. The fact is, \nInternet technology has grown unbelievably over the past year. \nAccording to a study released by the Pew Internet and American Life \nProject last week, 55 percent of American Internet users have access to \nbroadband, either at home or in the workplace. As a matter of fact, it \nis going to keep growing because I think the Senator from Tennessee \npointed out this afternoon there are some communities that have their \nown electric companies that are giving it away.\n  This thing is moving. We don't see anything slowing down. We are \nmoving fast. The report also noted home broadband usage is up 60 \npercent since March 2003, with half of the growth since November 2003.\n  You will recall back when we were debating this last year, the \nallegation was, gee, if we don't get this done, everything is going to \nbe taxed, things are going to end up in the mud, slowed down, and we \nare in trouble. Since the moratorium ended, half of this growth \noccurred. So this thing is moving. This moratorium--the fact we didn't \nextend it has not really impacted this one iota. DSL technology now has \na 42-percent share of the home market, which is up 28 percent since \nMarch 2003.\n  Most of the growth I outlined occurred after the Internet tax \nmoratorium expired last November, which refutes the argument S. 150 was \nnecessary to help the expansion of broadband services. In addition, \nApril 21--a couple days ago--a major telecommunications company \nreleased their 2004 first quarter earnings. I want to read the first \ntwo sentences from the company's press release because it illustrates \nhow fast this technology is growing. This is from SBC Communications:\n\n       SBC Communications, Inc., today reported first quarter 2004 \n     earnings of $1.9 billion, as it delivered strong progress in \n     key growth products. In the quarter SBC added 446,000 DSL \n     lines, the best ever by a U.S. telecom provider.\n\n  Some of these people who are supporting the Wyden-Allen amendment and \nnow McCain amendment are companies like this. They are doing well. They \nare moving. They are bragging, ``We are moving ahead.'' We all know the \nFederal Government today subsidizes this telecommunications industry. \nIf I remember correctly from a speech the Presiding Officer gave this \nafternoon, it is a $4 billion subsidy from the Federal Government, and \nthe States--all of them--have been doing\n\n[[Page S4421]]\n\neverything they can to encourage this industry.\n  I don't know of any industry that has been treated better than this \nindustry. For the life of me, I cannot understand why it is they insist \non having us whack out all of the taxes they are paying. I cannot \nunderstand it.\n  I think if this Senate does the right thing, what we are going to \ntell this industry, which does a pretty good job of lobbying around \nhere and in the States--I knew it when I was Governor--we will tell \nthem: You know what. You are not going to get a complete release of all \nthe taxes you pay. It is time for you to sit down, like I did with the \npetroleum industry and the Corn Growers--they came to me and wanted me \nwith them on ethanol, and the oil industry--and the Senator from \nOklahoma knows them well--said you have to be with us. I said, you know \nsomething, I had Ashland Marathon Oil in Ohio, and I had my Corn \nGrowers and I love you both. You ought to get in the room and sit down \nand talk to each other and see if you cannot work something out. Lo and \nbehold, after 6 months, they had a big news conference. About 20 \nSenators were there, and on that stage were people who, if you talked \nto them 6 months before and said you are going to be on the stage \ntogether in a compromise, would have said you are crazy. They were on \nthat stage and they put a compromise together.\n  The problem we have today in the Senate is the fact that the \ntelecommunications industry thinks this thing is going to go through \nand they don't have to sit down and talk to State and local government \nofficials, or with the Commerce Committee, and work something out. I \nknow it can be done. I am prayerful our colleagues today understand \nthat and that they will come together and say we have not been able to \ndo this, and we will have a continuation of a moratorium. But let's sit \ndown and work it out. Probably the best way to do that under the \ncircumstances, with the time limitation we have, would probably be to \npass a 14-or 15-month extension of the current moratorium, while we can \ntake it back to the Commerce Committee, where we can get the \ntelecommunications industry in, get the Governors and other local \ngovernment officials in, and the FCC, and start to make some sense out \nof this.\n  I thank the Senator from Tennessee, Senator Alexander, for the great \nleadership he has provided on this issue. We got together last year, \nand the train was moving and we got in the way of it and caught a lot \nof criticism because they were accusing us of being for taxing e-mail \nand the Internet and all the rest of it. That wasn't it at all. All we \nwanted to do was continue a moratorium but do no harm to our States. We \nprobably understand that more than some Members because we are former \nGovernors. In my case, I am a former mayor and county commissioner, and \nwe also appreciate it because we all worked together for legislation in \n1995--the unfunded mandates relief legislation I worked my heart out to \nget passed. As a matter of fact, the pen President Clinton used to sign \nthat legislation is on the wall in my Senate office in the Hart \nBuilding. The first time I set foot on the floor of the Senate was the \nday the Senate passed the unfunded mandates relief legislation.\n  I don't like unfunded mandates. I don't think it is fair. We have \ndone it to the States for so many years. We finally got that \nlegislation passed. The American people should know this is a big \nunfunded mandate, the way it is put together. We can change it and make \nit fair so they are not going to see the taxes on telecommunications \ndisappear and then see taxes increased in some other area.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, the Senator from Ohio and I know something \nabout unfunded mandates, as does the Chair. It keeps creeping up, and \nwe are making every effort in the committee that I chair and the \nsubcommittee the Senator from Ohio chairs to try to resolve that \nproblem. I think maybe we will because we have the right people in line \nto do it. I may not agree with the Senator from Ohio on this particular \nissue, but I certainly do on unfunded mandates.\n  I just found out that the distinguished Senator from New Mexico, Mr. \nDomenici, has filed an amendment that is a slimmed-down version of the \nEnergy bill. I just have to stake out a position early because it is my \nunderstanding that the safe harbor language that was in H.R. 6 that is \nso fair and so necessary is not a part of the slimmed-down version. If \nit is not in the bill, I am not going to be able to support the bill. I \nwill do everything I can for the Senator from New Mexico, but this is \nvery serious.\n  The bill should permit that manufacturers, producers, marketers, \ntraders and distributors of gasoline containing federally approved \noxygenate MTBE cannot be sued under a claim that it is a defective \nproduct.\n  The Federal Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 created the reformulated \ngas. The reformulated gas program said they had to use oxygenates. The \nmost prevalent oxygenate to be used in these reformulated gases is \nMTBE. In fact, EPA specifically approved MTBE for this purpose.\n  Here is the situation we have: We have the Government coming along \nand saying, You are going to have to use MTBE. For all practical \npurposes, they have said this, they have mandated it. Then they turn \naround and say, We are going to let the trial lawyers in to sue you \nbecause maybe this substance which we approved, which we endorsed, is \ncausing harm to someone. It is very important to understand that the \nsafe harbor provision is necessary to prevent the trial lawyers from \nusing the court system to punish companies for simply complying with \nthe Federal law by using a federally approved additive.\n  The safe harbor is narrowly targeted and does not affect any claim \nagainst any person or any company actually responsible for spilling \ngasoline containing MTBE. That is very important because I keep hearing \non this Senate floor: You let all these people off the hook who are \nspilling and polluting. That is not true at all. It is very narrowly \ndefined.\n  Since September 30, 2003, in anticipation of the Energy bill, trial \nlawyers, including many known for the work they have done and the \nwealth they have accumulated in asbestos litigation, have as of March \n25 brought over 60 groundwater contamination lawsuits in 17 States \nseeking damages from over 169 different named companies that allegedly \nmanufactured, sold, or transported gasoline containing the federally \napproved fuel additive called MTBE.\n  One of those companies is Frontier Oil. They have been sued. They \nhave never produced MTBE. They have never used it. They blended MTBE. \nBut they are one of the companies being sued. The lawsuits do not \nallege defendants actually leaked or spilled gasoline containing MTBE \nthat allegedly contaminated their groundwater. The lawsuits do not even \nname the actual polluters. Instead, the cases target any company that \nat any time may have distributed or sold gasoline containing MTBE or \neven some, as I just cited, that did not.\n  Defendants are vigorously defending these cases and will incur \nmillions of dollars in legal fees and expenses simply for having made \nor sold gasoline containing a fuel additive specifically approved for \nuse by Congress and the EPA.\n  I believe it is necessary to stake out this position. I cannot think \nof a fairness issue with which we have dealt that is more significantly \naddressed than this one. Government comes along and says you have to \nuse this stuff; then they come along later and say there is something \nwrong with it and we are not going to offer you any defense at all--any \ndefense. We are talking about huge multimillion-dollar lawsuits.\n  In the event this language does not end up in the legislation of the \nslimmed-down bill, I will have to oppose it. I cannot conscientiously \nsupport an energy bill that leaves everybody out to dry, particularly \nin the MTBE case.\n  That is my position. I think there are many others who share that \nposition of fairness in dealing with this bill.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S4422]]\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore (Mr. Chambliss). Without objection, \nit is so ordered.\n\n\n                             cloture motion\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Craig, \n           Ted Stevens, George Allen.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the live \nquorum with respect to the three cloture votes be waived.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am disappointed to have to come to the \nSenate floor and file these cloture motions at this time. Earlier \ntoday, I had hoped we would finally make progress on the pending \nInternet tax access bill. Last week, I said we would be addressing the \nInternet tax access bill Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, \nwhich I and most people felt would be sufficient time to address this \nbill and allow for amendments to be debated and discussed.\n  We did debate and vote on a relevant amendment offered by Senator \nHutchison today. However, at the very first opportunity to offer an \namendment from the other side of the aisle, they offered a completely \nnongermane amendment, which clearly is going to slow down this \nlegislation.\n  On Thursday, these cloture motions will be voted on. There will be \ntwo cloture votes with respect to the energy amendments, but ultimately \nwe will have a third cloture vote and that vote will be on the \nunderlying substitute relating to the Internet access bill. That is the \nvote that will determine if we will be going forward on this bill at \nthat time.\n  Again, I scheduled this measure with the hope of taking a few days \nand allowing Senators to have that opportunity to bring their \namendments to the Senate floor to debate and vote on those amendments. \nI hoped those amendments would be centering on the Internet tax bill, \nthe bill under consideration. The latest turn of events today means \nthat many Senators who have legitimate and relevant amendments are \nbeing denied the opportunity to debate and vote on their amendments. \nThis is unfortunate.\n  That said, I remain committed to finishing the bill in a timely \nfashion, and I hope that we can get back together tomorrow morning and \nmake appropriate plans in order to accomplish that over the course of \nthe next several days.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the distinguished leader will yield for a \nbrief comment, as I said to Senator Domenici this afternoon, this \nscenario that has been set up is going to create some very interesting \nvotes because if we move down the road where we come to a McCain \ncloture vote, if cloture is invoked, then Daschle and Domenici fall. At \nleast that is my understanding. If that is the case, then that part of \nthe Energy bill would be gone. But anyway, that sets up some \ninteresting dynamics here.\n  We do at least have out here, in addition to the FSC legislation, \npieces of the original Energy bill. Who knows, we might wind up doing \nsomething on energy.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I do hope we will be able to complete the \nInternet access bill and that we can work through the turn of events of \ntoday. Again, I hope over the course of the evening people will come \nback and lay out a plan to accomplish what is important to the \ntechnology community and the communications community broadly, and that \nis to be able to allow people to vote on the very important underlying \nbill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/27/senate-section/article/S4422-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4422]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

His philanthropic ventures and \ncontributions to our State's economy have long made him a valuable part \nof the southern Nevada community.\n  The Good Scout Award recognizes an individual who exemplifies \nScouting's ideals through professional leadership, community \ninvolvement, and personal commitment to excellence. This award reflects \nthe personal character, dedication, and generosity of the recipient, \nand I can think of nobody more deserving than Mr. Tiberti.\n  As founder and chairman of Tiberti Companies, Mr. Tiberti has served \nas a prominent leader in southern Nevada's business community for the \nlast 60 years. The company's construction of schools, hotels, banks, \ngrocery stores and department stores has helped meet the needs of \nsouthern Nevada's growing population.\n  He also contributed to the region's dramatic growth by serving on the \nLas Vegas Planning Commission for 25 years and as a director of Nevada \nPower Company for 36 years.\n  Mr. Tiberti has also been a noted philanthropist, giving generously \nto many worthwhile causes. In 1979, he contributed $1 million to create \nthe College of Engineering at the University of Nevada Las Vegas. This \ngenerous gift expanded the opportunities for higher education available \nto Nevadans and helped UNLV become one of our Nation's leading \nuniversities.\n  Mr. Tiberti and his family also have longstanding ties with the Boy \nScout program and were instrumental in the development of Spencer W. \nKimball Scout Reservation, Camp Potosi.\n  Please join me in congratulating J.A.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to one of \nArkansas' heroes who has paid the ultimate sacrifice in defense of his \nNation. Sgt. 1st Class William W. Labadie, 45, a native of Bauxite, AR, \nwas mortally wounded on April 7, 2004, during an attack by insurgents \non his camp just south of Baghdad.\n  William Labadie, known to his friends as Wild Bill, joined the Marine \nCorps right after high school. After serving in the Corps for 8 years \nhe returned home and later became a member of the Arkansas National \nGuard. Sgt. Labadie was known as a real soldier's soldier. He took his \nresponsibilities seriously and was excited by the\n\n[[Page S4423]]\n\nopportunity to use his training in the service of his country. After \nhaving been in Iraq for less than a month and in a combat zone for less \nthan 24 hours, Sgt. Labadie was fatally wounded when his camp came \nunder a mortar and small arms attack.\n  Our condolences and prayers go out to William's wife, Sunnie, of Del \nCity, OK; to his son, Bryan; and to his parents, Cheryl and Carl \nWinters of Bauxite, AR.\n  William's mother, Cheryl, was quoted in our State's newspaper, the \nBenton Courier, as saying that ``[t]his honestly was his goal in life. \nHe knew that this was his last shot at 45 years old. He told his \ncommanding officer: `Give me a shot.' It was like he was going to \nDisneyland.'' That kind of enthusiasm is what makes this nation great. \nWe honor William's spirit and his strong resolve to take on the \nresponsibility of advancing freedom to the world.\n\n\n                         Brandon Clinton Smith\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I also rise today to pay tribute to a \nson of Arkansas who gave up the security of his family and home to \nprotect our freedoms in the war on terrorism. Marine Private First \nClass Brandon Clinton Smith, 20, of Fayetteville was killed on March \n17, 2004, in Al Qaim, Iraq, as he and three of his fellow Marines were \nracing to help comrades who had come under attack by insurgents.\n  Brandon attended Fayetteville High School and dreamed of becoming a \nMarine. He fulfilled his dream by enlisting this past September. He was \nso proud of his decision that he framed his Marine Corps acceptance \nletter and hung it in his bedroom. Upon completing boot camp, Brandon \nbecame a member of the 3rd Battalion, 7th Marine Regiment, 1st Marine \nDivision, I Marine Expeditionary Force.\n  Brandon was buried with full military honors in Fayetteville on \nFriday, March 26.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor the victims of \nthe Armenian Genocide, one of the great tragedies of the 20th century. \nLast Saturday, April 24, 2004, marked the 89th anniversary of the \nbeginning of that tragic period and I urge all Americans to take time \nto remember, reflect, and pledge never to forget what happened.\n  On April 24, 1915, under the guise of collecting supplies for its \nparticipation in World War I, the Ottoman Empire launched a brutal and \nunconscionable policy of mass murder. The New York Times reported that \nthe Ottoman Empire had adopted a policy to annihilate the Armenians \nliving within the empire. Throughout the following years, Armenians \nfaced violent attacks, starvation, deportation, and murder. Sadly, the \nworld took little notice.\n  Before the violence began in 1914, 2.5 million Armenians lived in the \nOttoman Empire. As a result of the genocide, 1.5 million Armenians had \ndied and another 500,000 had been driven from their homes and villages. \nWe must remember and pay homage to those that died. We must remind the \nworld of these deaths and renew our commitment to ensure that such \ntragedies never happen again.\n  I am proud to represent an Armenian community of half a million in my \ngreat State of California. They are a strong and resilient community, \ntaking strength in the tragedies of the past and the promise of a \nbetter tomorrow. This community is leading the effort to preserve the \nmemory of the Armenian Genocide not only for future generations of \nArmenian Americans, but, indeed, for all Americans and all citizens of \nthe world.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in remembering the first genocide of \nthe 20th century. Through our commemoration of this tragedy, we make \nclear that we will not tolerate mass murder and ethnic cleansing ever \nagain and we will never forget.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, people around the world are joining \ntogether to solemnly remember and honor the men, women and children who \nperished in the Armenian genocide. Eighty-none years ago, 1\\1/2\\ \nmillion Armenians were systematically massacred at the hands of the \nOttoman Empire. Over 500,000 more were forced to flee their homeland of \n3,000 years. Before genocide was defined and codified in international \nlaw, Armenians experienced its horror.\n  Yet it appears that the international community did not learn the \nlessons of Armenia's genocide. Throughout the 20th century, the \ninternational community failed to act as governments in Germany, \nYugoslavia and Rwanda attempted to methodically eliminate people \nbecause of their religion or ethnicity. Minority groups were abandoned \nby the international community in each instance to be overwhelmed by \nviolence and despair. In Armenia, as in Rwanda and the Holocaust, the \nperpetrating governments scapegoated their minority groups for the \ndifficulties they faced as societies. They justified their campaigns of \nhatred with political and economic reasons in an attempt to rationalize \ntheir depravity.\n  This is why we must remember the Armenian genocide. To forget it is \nto enable more genocides and ethnic cleansing to occur. We must honor \nits victims by reaffirming our resolve to not let it happen again.\n  In the shadow of the Holocaust, in 1948, the United Nations adopted \nthe Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of \nGenocide. What Winston Churchill once called a ``crime without a \nname'', was now called ``genocide'' by the Convention and defined as \n``acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a \nnational, ethnical, racial or religious group.'' The Convention \nrequired its parties to create domestic legislation to hold \nperpetrators of genocide accountable for their actions and to place \nthese perpetrators before domestic courts or international tribunals.\n  The international community has a long way to go in punishing and \nespecially, preventing genocide. But we have made the first steps. As \nwe move forward, we must learn the lessons of Armenia's genocide. Can \nwe recognize the rhetorical veils of murderous leaders, thrown up to \ndisguise the agenda at hand? Have we, the international community, \nlearned that we must not stand by, paralyzed, as horrors occur, but \nwork collectively to prevent and stop genocides from occurring? We owe \nthe victims of the Armenian genocide this commitment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/27/senate-section/article/S4423-3", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4423-S4424]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           IN RECOGNITION OF 56 YEARS OF ISRAELI INDEPENDENCE\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Israel on 56 \nyears of independence. Last year, I visited Israel in my capacity as \nChairman of the Subcommittee on Near Eastern and South Eastern Affairs \nof the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. This was my first visit \nto Israel, and I was tremendously impressed with how much has been \naccomplished by this tiny country over the last several decades.

I am strongly committed to the long-term security of \nIsrael, and I will continue to work towards the vision of a safe and \nsecure Israel at peace with her Arab neighbors.\n  Israelis can be proud of the vibrant democracy that they have \ncreated, and I know that many Rhode Islanders share my deep \nappreciation for the close friendship between our two nations. I once \nagain offer my congratulations and best wishes to the Israeli people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/27/senate-section/article/S4424-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4424]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    BURMESE WAR CRIMES AGAINST WOMEN\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I wish to draw the attention of my \ncolleagues in the Senate to a new report by a credible organization \nbased on the Thailand-Burma border. In ``Shattering Silences,'' the \nKaren Women's Organization has carefully investigated and recorded the \nBurmese military regime's use of rape as a weapon of war against ethnic \nminority women, revealing a shockingly brutal and callous practice.\n  The report documents that both young and old women are being raped, \nand usually very brutally. Forty percent of the rapes committed by the \nregime's soldiers were gang rapes, and over one-quarter of the women \nwere killed after being raped.\n  This horrifying evidence, which echoes previous documentation \nconducted by our own State Department, suggests that Burma's regime is \ndeliberately using rape as a weapon to terrorize and subjugate the \nBurmese people. Fifty percent of the rapes were committed by officers \nin the military regime.\n  Many of us hoped that after the exposure of the use of rape as a \nweapon in Bosnia, the practice would come to an end. Sadly, our hopes \nhave not been fulfilled, and Burma is the new Bosnia. To be a woman in \nBurma's ethnic states is to live in constant fear of sexual violence \nand murder.\n  Ever since the United States imposed economic sanctions on Burma last \nyear, the ruling regime has made repeated promises of a so-called \ntransition to democracy. The rapes documented in this report show what \nmany of us have known for a very long time; that promises by this \nregime are meaningless. Our State Department must take a lead in \ncondemning these horrific acts and move to rally support for \ninternational sanctions on Burma. We cannot wait any longer, while more \nwomen face the war crimes committed by Burma's dictators.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/27/senate-section/article/S4424-2", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4424]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  NATIONAL PEACE OFFICERS MEMORIAL DAY\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I proudly note passage of S. Res. 310, a \nresolution to designate May 15, 2004, as National Peace Officers \nMemorial Day. I again cosponsored this resolution with Senator \nCampbell, as we do every year. We are right to remember and commemorate \nthe sacrifice and commitment of our law enforcement officers serving \nour communities, States and country. We annually honor the officers and \ntheir families who made the ultimate sacrifice for public safety.\n  I commend Senator Campbell for his leadership in this issue. This \nmarks the 8th year running that he and I have teamed up to submit the \nresolution to commemorate National Peace Officers Memorial Day. As a \nformer deputy sheriff, Senator Campbell has experienced first-hand the \nrisks faced by law enforcement officers every day while they protect \nour communities.\n  I also want to thank each of our Nation's brave law enforcement \nofficers for their unwavering commitment to the safety and protection \nof their fellow citizens. They are real-life heroes.\n  Currently, more than 850,000 men and women who guard our communities \ndo so at great risk. Each year, 1 in 15 offices is assaulted, 1 in 46 \nofficers is injured, and 1 in 5,255 officers is killed in the line of \nduty in the United States every other day. After the hijacked planes \nhit the World Trade Center in New York City on September 11, 2001, 72 \npeace officers died while trying to ensure that their fellow citizens \nin those buildings got to safety. That act of terrorism resulted in the \nhighest number of peace officers ever killed in a single incident in \nthe history of this country.\n  In 2003, 146 law enforcement officers died while serving in the line \nof duty, well below the decade-long average of 165 deaths annually, and \na major drop from 2001 when a total of 237 officers were killed. A \nnumber of factors contributed to this reduction including better \nequipment and the increased use of bullet-resistant vests, improved \ntraining, and advanced emergency medical care. And, in total, more than \n17,100 men and women have made the ultimate sacrifice--of that number \n43 are police officers who have already been killed in 2004 while \nserving in the line of duty.\n  During the 108th Congress, we have improved the Justice Department's \nPublic Safety Officers Benefits program by making law the Hometown \nHeroes Survivors Benefits Act (Public Law 108-182), which allows \nsurvivors of public safety officers who suffer fatal heart attacks or \nstrokes while participating in non-routine stressful or strenuous \nphysical activities to qualify for federal survivor benefits.\n  The Senate also passed the Campbell-Leahy Bulletproof Vest \nPartnership Grant Act, S. 764, which will extend through FY 2007 the \nauthorization of appropriations for the Bulletproof Vest Partnership \nGrant Program that helps State, tribal and local jurisdictions purchase \narmor vests for use by law enforcement officers. The House has yet to \nact on this important measure. We want to be sure that every police \nofficer who needs a bulletproof vest gets one.\n  Last month, the Senate added to the gun liability bill by a vote of \n91-8 the Campbell-Leahy Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act, S. 253. \nThis measure would establish national measures of uniformity and \nconsistency to permit trained and certified on-duty, off-duty or \nretired law enforcement officers to carry concealed firearms in most \nsituations so that they may respond immediately to crimes across State \nand other jurisdictional lines, as well as to protect themselves and \ntheir families from vindictive criminals.\n  This National Peace Officers Memorial Day, Vermonters will remember \nour brave State Police Trooper, Sergeant Michael Johnson, who was \nkilled last Father's Day while trying to stop a suspect leading two \nother State troopers on a high-speed chase. Sergeant Johnson was not \neven on duty, but he went to help his fellow troopers that Sunday \nafternoon after hearing their trouble on his radio. He had just \ndeployed a set of tire spikes across the interstate when the suspect \nswerved to avoid the spikes and struck him. Sergeant Johnson left \nbehind his wife and three children. Words are insufficient for the \nbrave sacrifice of the man who was so admired by his family, community \nand the Vermont State Police force. In memory of this bravery and \nservice to his family, community, State and country, Sergeant Johnson \nwill be one of the names added this year to the National Law \nEnforcement Officers Memorial.\n  National Peace Officers Memorial Day will provide the people of the \nUnited States with the opportunity to honor the extraordinary service \nand sacrifice given year after year by our police forces. More than \n15,000 peace offices are expected to gather in Washington to join with \nthe families of their fallen comrades. I thank the Senate for acting on \nthis important resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/27/senate-section/article/S4424-3", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4424-S4425]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          CHINESE COMPETITION\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, in 2001, World Trade \nOrganization members accepted China into the organization only after \nnegotiating the most complex accession agreement in WTO history. Under \ntheir accession agreement, China committed to adopting a market- and \nrules-based economy and special safeguards for the domestic industries \nof other WTO members that could be severely injured by surges of \nimports from China's non-market economy. China has yet to live up to \ntheir commitments. China's problems stem from a significant lack of \nintellectual\n\n[[Page S4425]]\n\nproperty right enforcement, to the continued dumping and transshipping \nof textiles, to the subsidizing of their steel industry. China also \nmanipulates their currency, the yuan, in order to gain an unfair \ncompetitive advantage.\n  These unfair trade practices seriously jeopardize many United States \nindustries, including the textile and steel industries. The textile \nindustry has been hit particularly hard by unfair trade with China. \nSince 1997, more than 250 textile plants in the U.S. have closed. With \nquotas on textile and apparel set to be totally phased-out on January \n1, 2005, it is not unrealistic to expect even more job losses and \nfactory closings in the textile industry. Quotas are set under the \nMultifiber Arrangement, MFA, an international agreement that allows \ncountries to impose quotas on the level of goods imported from \nindividual supplier countries. The MFA was designed to prevent a \nworldwide crisis in textile and apparel trade. Specifically, it was \nneeded to keep very low wage producing nations from overwhelming global \nmarkets.\n  If these quotas are lifted, China is poised to control 70 percent of \nthe textile and apparel market share. Allowing China to dominate world \nmarkets in this sector will result in the devastation of many third \nworld economies, resulting in widespread economic and social \ninstability.\n  If the goals of the World Trade Organization are to increase global \nprosperity and economic advancement through orderly trade, and \nespecially to advance the development of the third world through \norderly trade flows, we have to ask ourselves the following question: \nDoes our current trade policy with China help further those goals, or \nwill it continue to cost millions of United States' manufacturing jobs \nand undermine global advancement in general and in the third world \nspecifically?\n  With the expiration of the quotas, the United States will see even \nmore of the products they buy manufactured in a country that allows \ntheir workers to be treated poorly. Workers in Chinese factories suffer \nserious, routine and on-going abuse at the hands of their employers. \nHealth and safety conditions almost always fail to meet Chinese law or \ninternational standards, and workers regularly work illegally long \nhours for overtime pay that is not calculated according to law. Chinese \nworkers also face harsh disciplinary measures and the use of heavy \nfines for minor infractions of factory rules.\n  We need to let China know that if they keep dumping and transshipping \ntextiles, permanent quotas will be put in place. If China continues to \nsteal intellectual property rights, they will find themselves before \nevery WTO tribunal that exists. One of the best investments the U.S. \never made was spending billions of dollars during the Cold War to \nprohibit the spreading of communism. We need to show similar strength \nwhen it comes to standing up against China's communist dictatorship \nthat trades unfairly, oppresses its people, and bleeds our economy dry.\n  What I would like to see my country do, Republican and Democrat, is \nto ask the Chinese to stop cheating; to try to persuade the Chinese \ngovernment through international organizations such as the WTO, to stop \nstealing market share and become a better member of the Family of \nNations. There's a lot of resistance to any idea about change. Our \nopponents argue that current trade policy is appropriate because of the \nfact that it may reduce prices to consumers. This is only true if you \nreview what hidden costs we are paying. Such costs include: over 3 \nmillion lost manufacturing jobs in the past 5 years, frozen wages, \nhealth and pension benefits for workers that have managed to remain \nemployed, shrinking tax base for Federal, State and local government. \nMaybe the greatest cost, however, is to our national security. There is \nno doubt that the United States was the single greatest military power \nin the 20th century because of its industrial strength. If we make \nChina the new industrial superpower, will that not translate into China \nbecoming the single greatest military power of the 21st century?\n  The large economic growth China has experienced over the last several \nyears is not going to the average Chinese citizen. In fact, it is \nestimated that just 0.16 percent of the Chinese population controls 65 \npercent of the nation's U.S. $1.5 trillion liquid assets in the \nMainland bank deposits. The income distribution in China is likely to \nbe the most unequal in the world. Rather than using this economic \ngrowth to help China's 800 million rural residents who earn the \nequivalent of just 80 cents per day, it is going to their military \ndisproportionately.\n  Today, China is the world's largest purchaser for foreign military \nweapons and technology. China's defense industry has become far more \nproductive in the last five years and improvements can be expected as \nthe Chinese economy continues to grow. China is now more than doubling \nits budgeted defense spending this year as part of an aggressive \nmilitary modernization strategy. And some European countries are even \npushing the European Union to lift the arms trade embargo on China. \nWhat I considered at one time to be a regional problem is a national \nsecurity problem.\n  Rigged and unfair international trading rules are a key cause of the \nU.S. manufacturing crisis. China's unfair trade practices are costing \nUnited States jobs and jeopardizing our manufacturing base. They have \nshown that they are not yet committed to participating in a rules-based \nglobal trading system and are not yet willing to make the necessary \nsteps to transition into a market-based economy.\n  China continues to manipulate the currency markets to keep the dollar \nartificially high and its own currency, the yuan, artificially low. By \nplaying the currency market in this manner, China effectively \nsubsidizes their exports to the U.S. and places a tariff on U.S. \nshipments to China. This mercantilist practice has caused serious \ndamage to the U.S. manufacturing sector. The U.S. Congress must take \naction.\n  Senator Charles Schumer and I have introduced legislation that would \nrequire China to adopt a market-based system of currency. The goal of \nthis legislation is to remove China's unfair currency advantage and the \ndetrimental impact that it is having in the U.S. and abroad.\n  Something must be done to alleviate the detrimental economic impact \nChina is having on our manufacturing industry. I urge the Leadership to \nallow a clean vote on this important legislation. I believe it will \nreceive overwhelming bipartisan support and give the administration one \nmore tool to get the Chinese to uphold their WTO obligations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/27/senate-section/article/S4425-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4425-S4426]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MOTORSPORTS FACILITIES FAIRNESS ACT\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong and \nenthusiastic support for S. 1524, the ``Motorsports Facilities Fairness \nAct.'' This legislation would properly clarify and codify the \nclassification of a ``motorsports entertainment complex'' as 7-year \nproperty for depreciation purposes. The legislation would define a \n``motorsports entertainment complex'' as a permanent facility that \nhosts one or more racing events each year that are sanctioned by a \nnationally recognized sanctioning body. I was an original cosponsor of \nS. 1524, when my colleague, Senator Santorum, introduced it last July \n31.\n  Virginia is home to twenty-seven motorsports facilities, ranging from \nthe one-eighth of a mile Natural Bridge Dragstrip to such NASCAR Nextel \nCup facilities as Richmond International Raceway and Martinsville \nSpeedway. These tracks are found in every part of the Commonwealth, \nfrom Coeburn in Southwest Virginia, to Manassas in Northern Virginia to \nNorfolk in Hampton Roads. Every track makes a contribution to the \neconomy, whether they run a weekly racing series, or draw over 100,000 \nfans for a Nextel Cup event.\n  The importance of these tracks for jobs and economic growth in \nVirginia was illustrated in an April 21, article in the Washington \nTimes, by Jeffrey Sharpshott, entitled, ``Virginia City Seeks \n`Something Else.' '' This article described the significant positive \nimpact of motorsports and the Martinsville Speedway on the area's \neconomy: ``Martinsville, next-door neighbor to North Carolina, also \ntried to latch onto the rising popularity of auto racing and NASCAR. \nThe town parlayed its speedway into a tourist draw. It opened a small \ncommunity-\n\n[[Page S4426]]\n\ncollege program to teach future auto-team mechanics and managers. Kyle \nPetty, a team owner and driver, donated automotive parts. Tobacco \ncommission funds allowed Patrick Henry Community College, the county's \nlone institution of higher learning, to retool a derelict building into \nheadquarters for a motor-sports training program and to rev up the \ncurriculum. ``We're actually getting people jobs,'' motor-sports \ninstructor Mike Sharpe says, standing among brightly painted car \nbodies, reinforced racing frames, powerful engines and high-tech \ncalibration equipment.''\n  The Motorsports Facilities Fairness Act would provide certainty to \ntrack and speedway operators regarding the depreciation of their \nproperties. This common sense proposal is necessary to allow these \nfacilities to continue to enhance local and regional economies and to \ncontribute to job growth.\n  The Motorsports Facilities Fairness Act responds to the recent \ndecision of the IRS to question the long-standing depreciation \ntreatment of motorsports complexes used by facility owners. For \ndecades, motorsports facilities were classified as ``theme and \namusement facilities'' for depreciation purposes. This long-standing \ntreatment was widely applied and accepted, until now. Over the years, \nrelying on this good faith understanding of the tax law, facility \nowners and operators invested hundreds of millions of dollars in \nbuilding and upgrading these properties.\n  S. 1524 would merely allow the track owners to classify these \nfacilities for tax purposes in the same way that they have done, \nwithout question, for years, or in some cases, decades.\n  I urge the Senate to ``green flag'' the process on this winning \nmeasure. Approve S. 1524, the Motorsports Facilities Fairness Act. \nLet's wave the ``checkered flag'' for jobs, economic growth and logic.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/27/senate-section/article/S4426-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4426]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         RACETRACK DEPRECIATION\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida.

Now they are \nchallenging this longstanding industry practice and treating racetracks \ndifferently than other entertainment complexes.\n  That is simply unfair and will have a dire economic effect, \ndiscouraging the capital investments that these facilities rely on to \nimprove their product and attract the legions of fans that have been so \nvaluable to small towns across the country.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting prompt enactment of S. \n1524, the ``Motorsports Fairness Act'' to clarify that these facilities \nare indeed 7-year property for purposes of depreciation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/27/senate-section/article/S4426-2", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4426]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       20TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE INTERNATIONAL REPUBLICAN INSTITUTE\n\n  Mr. McCAIN.

We do it because we know that, as Ronald Reagan \nsaid in 1982 when he cited the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, \n``freedom is not the sole prerogative of a lucky few, but the \ninalienable and universal right of all human beings.'' In America, we \nenjoy the fundamental right to be free. But we also know that we will \nnever enjoy our rights in the fullness of security until all of \nhumanity is also free.\n  The promotion of democracy and fundamental human rights is thus an \ninextricable element of American foreign policy. We use our power not \nsimply to enhance our security, but to promote our values--for the good \nof others. For 20 years IRI has monitored elections, trained political \ncandidates, promoted government reform, helped organize civil society, \nand increased political participation. Its mission is vital, and IRI \nhas performed it with success in over 75 countries.\n  Anyone who reads the newspapers can see how critical this mission is \ntoday. Iraq is the biggest democracy project in a generation, and IRI \nis active on the ground, making a difference on a daily basis. Beyond \nIraq, there is a growing recognition that the lack of freedom in the \nGreater Middle East offends not only America's national values, but \nalso threatens our security. In other regions too--Central Asia, \nSoutheast Asia, and others--freedom is lacking. When we confront these \nsituations, the diagnosis is easy. The hard part is taking action. IRI \ntakes action. Promoting democracy is a huge task--one IRI does \nsuperbly--and calls will only increase for it to do more.\n  I am confident it is up to the job. For 20 years the individuals who \nmake up the International Republican Institute have made a positive \ndifference in the world. While these are not the type of people to rest \non their laurels, we should all recognize that these laurels are well \ndeserved.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/27/senate-section/article/S4426-3", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4426-S4427]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE SALK POLIO VACCINE FIELD TRIALS\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I have always been one to support \ninnovation. It is with the innovative researchers of this Nation and \nthe world that have provided us with some of the greatest contributions \nin history. Inventions such as the computer, the Internet, the \nautomobile, the airplane, and vaccines have transformed the world as we \nonce knew it, to the world that we live in now.\n  I would like to take a moment and recognize yesterday's event \ncommemorating April 26, 2004, as the 50th Anniversary of the Salk polio \nvaccine field trials, a truly significant day for our Nation.\n  On April 26, the March of Dimes and the Centers for Disease Control \nand Prevention, commemorated the 50th anniversary of the development of \nthe Salk polio vaccine along with several other organizations. This day \nin April holds great significance for the nation as it was that day in \n1954 that the first dose of the Salk vaccine was distributed to \nchildren at Franklin Sherman Elementary school in McLean, VA as part of \nthe National Field Trial Program. In the months that followed, more \nthan 1,800,000 school children, collectively referred to as ``Polio \nPioneers'', participated in these trials.\n  The outcomes of these field trials were truly significant. Reports \nindicated that the Salk vaccine was 80-90 percent effective in \npreventing polio and in the four years following the trials, medical \npersonnel administered 450 million doses of the vaccine, making it a \nstandard fixture among childhood immunizations. By the end of 2003, \npoliomyelitis had been eliminated world-wide in all but 6 countries. \nThe result of this vaccination--nearly 5 million children have been \ngiven the ability to walk who would otherwise have been paralyzed and \n1.25 million childhood deaths have been averted.\n  The Salk polio vaccine is a great contribution to our nation and to \nthe entire world. While poliovirus was eradicated from the United \nStates by the early 1980's, it continues to exist in the wild in a \nlimited number of regions around the world. Nevertheless, the World \nHealth Organization has set 2005 as the target date for complete, \nglobal eradication of the virus. It is through the unwavering support \nand undying\n\n[[Page S4427]]\n\nefforts of the innovators of this world and organizations such as the \nMarch of Dimes that make this occasion possible. The people of Virginia \nthank you, the people of the United States thank you, and most \nimportantly the world thanks you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/27/senate-section/article/S4427-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4427]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO BEN H. BELL III\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, Members of Congress, it is not often we \nhave an opportunity to recognize a senior executive in the United \nStates Government as a leader, loyal soldier and a patriot. Ben H. Bell \nIII epitomizes these traits after dedicating his adult life to serving \nthis great country in several impressive capacities. Ben protected and \ndefended our Nation during his 21 years as an officer and leader in the \nMarine Corps. He safeguarded our borders for 9 years, holding his last \nposition as Assistant Commissioner for Intelligence with the Department \nof Immigration and Naturalization Services. For the next 2 years, Ben \nhelped design the Foreign Terrorism Tracking Task Force just after 9/11 \nunder Presidential directive and direction from the Attorney General.\n  Soon after, Secretary Mineta and Deputy Secretary ADM James Loy \nrecruited Mr. Bell to establish and lead this Nation's first Office of \nNational Risk Assessment, ONRA. This congressionally mandated office \nand its mission define our Nation's newly emerging need to manage and \nmitigate extreme risk for the protection of our homeland from \nterrorism.\n  It is through great dedication, unconditional loyalty, leadership, \nand passion that Ben H. Bell III has protected and defended our way of \nlife every day without ever giving it a second thought.\n  On behalf of my colleagues in Congress and myself, we thank you, \ncongratulate you, and salute you on such an accomplished and dynamic \ncareer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/27/senate-section/article/S4427-2", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4427]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO COLONEL WILLIAM GROVES\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an \nexceptional officer in the United States Air Force, an individual that \na great many of us have come to know personally over the past few \nyears--Colonel William ``Bill'' Groves. Colonel Groves, who currently \nserves in the office of Air Force Legislative Liaison, will retire \nafter 21 years of active duty Air Force service. During his time in \nWashington, and especially with regard to his work here on Capitol \nHill, Colonel Groves epitomized Air Force core values of integrity, \nselfless service and excellence in the many missions the Air Force \nperforms in support of our national security. Many Members and staff \nhave enjoyed the opportunity to meet with him on a variety of Air Force \nissues and came to deeply appreciate his character and many talents. \nToday it is my privilege to recognize some of Colonel Groves' many \naccomplishments, and to commend his superb service he provided the Air \nForce, the Congress and our Nation.\n  Colonel Groves entered the Air Force by Direct Appointment in 1983 \nwith a Juris Doctor degree from the University of Akron School of Law. \nDuring his 21-year career, he served three tours as a Staff Judge \nAdvocate, with assignments at the 6th Air Refueling Wing, the Air Force \nOffice of Scientific Research, and the Aerospace Guidance and Metrology \nCenter. In 1990, he completed a Masters of Law program in Government \nProcurement at George Washington University, in Washington, DC. He has \ncompleted two overseas tours in Germany and was deployed in 1994 as the \nLegal Advisor for the Combined Air Operations Center, Vicenza, Italy, \nduring Operations DENY FLIGHT and PROVIDE PROMISE. Just prior to his \ncurrent assignment, he served as Assistant General Counsel for \nProcurement, Missile Defense Agency here in Washington, D.C.\n  In 2001, Colonel Groves was selected as Chief, Programs and Policy \nBranch for the Air Force Directorate of Legislative Liaison. During \nthis period, Colonel Groves led 14 liaison personnel responsible for \nall Air Force interactions with the Armed Services Committees on \npersonnel issues, readiness, depot maintenance, environmental \ncompliance, airspace and range operations, force structure, base \nclosure, health care, inspector general matters, military construction, \nand acquisition policies. Additionally, he directed the process used \nfor USAF activities worldwide to submit legislative proposals to \nCongress. In his years of working with the Congress, Colonel Groves \nprovided a clear and credible voice for the Air Force while \nrepresenting its many programs on the Hill, consistently providing \naccurate, concise and timely information. His integrity, \nprofessionalism, and expertise enabled him to develop and maintain an \nexceptional rapport between the Air Force and the Congress. The key to \nhis success, I believe, was his deep understanding of congressional \nprocesses and priorities and his unflinching advocacy of the programs \nessential to the Air Force and to our Nation. I am greatly appreciative \nof Colonel Groves' 21-year service to his Nation and offer my sincere \nwishes for a happy and prosperous retirement. On behalf of the Congress \nand the country, I thank Colonel Groves and his wife Joanne for the \ncommitment and sacrifices that they have made throughout his honorable \nmilitary career. I know I speak for all of my colleagues in expressing \nmy heartfelt appreciation to Colonel Groves for a job well done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/27/senate-section/article/S4427-3", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4427-S4428]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n       NATIONAL PRIMARY IMMUNE DEFICIENCY DISEASES AWARENESS WEEK\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of \nNational Primary Immune Deficiency Diseases Awareness Week. The \nnational awareness week took place the week of April 19th. Primary \nimmune deficiency diseases PIDD, are genetic disorders in which part of \nthe body's immune system is missing or does not function properly. The \nWorld Health Organization recognizes more than 150 primary immune \ndiseases which affect as many as 50,000 people in the United States. \nFortunately, 7 percent of PIDD patients are able to maintain their \nhealth through regular infusions of a plasma product known as \nintravenous immunoglobulin. IGIV helps bolster the immune system and \nprovides critical protection against infection and disease.\n  The Immune Deficiency Foundation, which is the Nation's leading \norganization dedicated to improving the quality of life for PIDD \npatients is located in Towson, MD. The foundation was founded in 1980 \nby parents of primary immune deficient children and their physicians. \nAt that time, there were few treatments for many primary immune \ndeficiency diseases, and the treatments that were available were \npainful and not very effective. There were no educational materials for \npatients, no public advocacy initiatives, and little research was being \ndone. Over the past 24 years, the foundation has made tremendous \nstrides.\n  Recently, the foundation entered into a historic research partnership \nwith the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the \nNational Institutes of Health. The establishment of the ``US \nImmunodeficiency Network'' represents the most significant advancement \nin primary immune deficiency research in our Nation's history. Despite \nthe recent progress in PIDD research, the average length of time \nbetween the onset of symptoms in a patient and a definitive diagnosis \nof PIDD is nine and a half years. In the interim, those afflicted may \nsuffer repeated and serious infections and possibly irreversible damage \nto internal organs. That it why it is critical that we raise awareness \nabout these illnesses within the general public and the health care \ncommunity.\n  I commend the Immune Deficiency Foundation for its leadership in this \narea and I am proud that I was able to join them in recognizing the \nweek of April 19 as National Primary Immune Deficiency Diseases \nAwareness Week. I encourage my colleagues to help improve the quality \nof life for PIDD patients and their families.\n\n[[Page S4428]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/27/senate-section/article/S4427-3", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4427-S4428]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n       NATIONAL PRIMARY IMMUNE DEFICIENCY DISEASES AWARENESS WEEK\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI.

Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the \nInternational Republican Institute on the 20th anniversary of its \nfounding. As an IRI Board member since 1999, I have witnessed IRI's \ntremendous success in helping build democracy across the globe.\n  The International Republican Institute was founded in response to a \n1982 speech by President Ronald Reagan, in which he called for a broad \ncommitment to helping developing countries build democratic \ninstitutions. IRI began its work in Latin America. When the cold war \nended, IRI expanded its programs to the states of the former Soviet \nUnion.\n  Through its work today in more than 50 countries, IRI reinforces the \nAmerican belief that all people can achieve freedom through the \ndevelopment of democratic political parties, good governance, and \ntransparent election processes. IRI's success in teaching those in \nemerging democracies to build and manage democratic institutions does \nnot stop at these countries' borders. Volunteers from Romania, Serbia, \nand other countries where IRI has worked are now helping to build a \ncivil society in Iraq.\n  IRI also provides citizens from across the U.S. the opportunity to \nvolunteer their skills to assist countries undergoing democratic \ntransition. IRI volunteers teach others how to run political campaigns, \nincrease the participation of women and youth, monitor elections, \ndeliver government services, and communicate effectively with the \npublic.\n  I congratulate and thank the International Republican Institute for \nits commitment to helping strengthen democracy around the \nworld.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/27/senate-section/article/S4428-2", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4428]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          CHRISTOPHER B. ELSER\n\n Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, Christopher B. \nElser of Camden, SC, died on the afternoon of April 18, 2004. \nChristopher, a student at John Hopkins University in Baltimore, MD, \ndied from stab wounds he received from an early-morning intruder who \nentered the room where he was sleeping. Christopher had spent the night \nin a fraternity brother's room after a party so his friend would have a \nquiet place to study.\n  Christopher was a junior in the Zanvyl Krieger School of Arts and \nSciences at the University. He was also a member of Sigma Alpha Epsilon \nfraternity and played soccer his freshman year. He was known as a \nconsummate gentleman, both on campus and off. As one of his fraternity \nbrothers said, ``We all strived to be gentlemen, but we never had \nanyone embody it as much as Chris.'' His memorial service on April 19, \n2004, drew more than 1,000 friends and family members to honor his \nlife. Their numerous stories and memories further cemented \nChristopher's status as a gentlemen and also demonstrated the \ntremendous positive impact he had on everyone he met.\n  At an early age, Christopher developed an affinity with the \nthoroughbred horse business, nourished by his father's occupation as a \nthoroughbred trainer and consignor. As a precocious 10-year-old, he \nbegan his tenure on the Stable Crew at the August Yearling Sale in \nSaratoga, NY, serving with young men twice his age. Until his death, he \nworked in Saratoga for two weeks every August and was known for his \ninfectious smile and inexhaustible spirit in both his work at the sale \nand in numerous after-hours adventures.\n  Christopher's memorial service in Camden, SC, was held outdoors at \nthe Carolina Cup Steeplechase Museum on April 23, 2004. In an \natmosphere reminiscent of his easygoing fun-loving demeanor, \nChristopher's friends and family gathered to celebrate his 20 years of \nlife. As tales about his life unfolded, it became clear to all present \nwhat had made Christopher so special: his love for life. This trait \nbrought more than 100 people together to honor an extraordinary young \nman's life and to mourn his untimely death. After the service, friends \nand family ate, drank, and told more stories of Christopher and, as he \nwould have wished, there was more laughter than tears on this \nbeautiful, South Carolina morning\n  Christopher is survived by his father, Kip, his mother, Rhetta, and \nhis sister, Taylor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/27/senate-section/article/S4428-3", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4428]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ENROLLED BILL SIGNED\n\n  At 2:24 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker, \non April 22, 2004, has signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n       S. 2022.

A bill to establish the Long island Sound Stewardship \nSystem; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, Long Island Sound holds a special place \nin our Nation's history, its present, and its future. It has played a \nkey role in the development of the Nation, from the early days of the \ncolonists, through to this day. Its bounty nourished the colonists, its \ncoves sheltered their ships, and provided harbors for trade.\n  Today, Long Island Sound remains a vital resource to the area: its \nbiological resources provide jobs, and its beauty draws tourists who \ncome to visit the Sound to fish, to sail, and simply to enjoy its \nshores. It is estimated that these activities contribute approximately \n$5 billion annually to the economy of the region. This is not so \nsurprising when you realize that over 28 million people live within 50 \nmiles of the Sound.\n  It is a blessing that so many people can enjoy and benefit from Long \nIsland Sound, in so many ways. But it is also a challenge that \nthreatens the future of the Sound. Less than 20 percent of the \nshoreline of Long Island Sound is accessible to the public, and every \nyear, more shoreline is developed and removed from public access. \nMarshes and estuaries around the Sound are being drained and developed \nat an alarming rate. These tidal marshes are critical for the \necological health of the Sound, which is the foundation of the Sound's \nvital economic contribution to the region. In short, to preserve the \nblessings of Long Island Sound for future generations, this generation \nmust act. This is why Senator Clinton and I have introduced the Long \nIsland Sound Stewardship Act.\n  The Long Island Sound Stewardship Act builds on the years of good \nwork done by the Long Island Sound Study Group. This group, made up of \ndedicated people from Federal, State, and local government agencies, \nnon-government organizations, and private interests, has worked \ntogether to develop a vision of good stewardship for Long Island Sound. \nMany of them are here today, and I thank them for their hard work.\n  Our bill will help us achieve their vision, by providing funds and a \ncongressional mandate to work towards this vision. Under this bill, \nthose who agree to preserve public access or ecological characteristics \nof their land can be recognized by having the land designated as a Long \nIsland Stewardship Site. The bill also provides funding to facilitate \nthe preservation of these characteristics. Most important, the bill \nachieves these ends through a voluntary program, a cooperative venture \nbetween all the stakeholders: public and private, Federal, State, and \nlocal.\n  The Long Island Sound Study has already set a fine example of \ncooperation and vision. I introduce this bill to further that vision. I \nlook forward to working with the Connecticut and New York delegations, \nand all the stakeholders, as we develop and refine this bill. I am \nconfident that working together, we will preserve the blessings of Long \nIsland Sound.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Long Island Sound \nStewardship Act be printed in the record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2350\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Long Island Sound \n     Stewardship Act of 2004''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) Long Island Sound is a national treasure of great \n     cultural, environmental, and ecological importance;\n       (2) 8,000,000 people live within the Long Island Sound \n     watershed and 28,000,000 people (approximately 10 percent of \n     the population of the United States) live within 50 miles of \n     Long Island Sound;\n       (3) activities that depend on the environmental health of \n     Long Island Sound contribute more than $5,000,000,000 each \n     year to the regional economy;\n       (4) the portion of the shoreline of Long Island Sound that \n     is accessible to the general public (estimated at less than \n     20 percent of the total shoreline) is not adequate to serve \n     the needs of the people living in the area;\n       (5) existing shoreline facilities are in many cases \n     overburdened and underfunded;\n       (6) large parcels of open space already in public ownership \n     are strained by the effort to balance the demand for \n     recreation with the needs of sensitive natural resources;\n       (7) approximately \\1/3\\ of the tidal marshes of Long Island \n     Sound have been filled, and much of the remaining marshes \n     have been ditched, dyked, or impounded, reducing the \n     ecological value of the marshes; and\n       (8) many of the remaining exemplary natural landscape is \n     vulnerable to further development.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to establish the \n     Long Island Sound Stewardship System to preserve areas of \n     critical importance because of the open space, public access, \n     and ecological value of the areas.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to establish a Federal Interagency Committee on \nEmergency Medical Services and a Federal Interagency Committee on \nEmergency Medical Services Advisory Council, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Emergency \nMedical Services Support Act of 2004 with my colleague, Senator Russ \nFeingold. This legislation will strengthen Federal efforts to support \ncommunity-based emergency medical services across America.\n\n[[Page S4432]]\n\n  A comprehensive, coordinated emergency medical services system is \nessential to assure quality care and prompt response in incidents \nranging from automobile crashes to catastrophic weather to terrorist \nattacks. The emergency medical services system is a crucial part of our \nhealth care safety net.\n  Unfortunately, for the past twenty years, Federal support for EMS has \nbeen both inefficient and uncoordinated. No fewer than seven Federal \nagencies are involved in various aspects of emergency medical services. \nMost, however, focus on only one segment of the EMS system and don't \neffectively coordinate with other agencies.\n  In 2001, at the request of Senator Feingold and myself, the General \nAccounting Office researched the status of this vital system. The GAO \nreport, titled, ``Emergency Medical Services: Reported needs are Wide-\nRanging with a Growing Focus on Lack of Data,'' exposed the need to \nincrease coordination among Federal agencies as they address the needs \nof regional, State, or local emergency medical services systems.\n  This legislation would formally establish a Federal Interagency \nCommittee on Emergency Medical Services (FICEMS), which is currently an \nad-hoc committee with little formal direction. It would require the \nNational Highway Traffic Safety Administration, in coordination with \nthe Department of Homeland Security, to provide organizational and \nstaff support.\n  This legislation would enhance coordination among the Federal \nagencies involved with the State, local, tribal and regional emergency \nmedical services and 9-1-1 systems. It also would help Federal agencies \ncoordinate their EMS-related activities and maximize the best use of \nestablished funding.\n  The President has recognized the need for this coordination. He \nincluded a similar proposal in his reauthorization proposal for the \n``Safe, Accountable, Flexible, and Efficient Transportation Equity act \nof 2003'' (SAFETEA) that was transmitted by Secretary Mineta to \nCongress on May 12, 2003. The Senate-passed highway bill also included \na similar proposal.\n  The legislation we introduce today builds upon the Administration's \nproposal by creating a more effective structure and enhancing the role \nof local EMS providers into Federal EMS programs. While I support the \nprovisions in the Senate-passed bill, they fail to create a mechanism \nfor individuals at the state and local levels to provide input into how \nFederal EMS programs should be coordinated.\n  Local, State and Federal level emergency medical services systems are \nextremely diverse and involve numerous different agencies and \norganizations. To assure a viable, responsive emergency medical \nservices system, Federal agencies need the input and advice of their \nnon-Federal partners and from persons regulating or providing emergency \nmedical services systems at the state and local level.\n  According to Tom Judge, the Executive Director of Lifeflight of \nMaine, an air ambulance provider, and Jay Bradshaw, the State of \nMaine's EMS Director, improved coordination can help strengthen support \nfor a wide range of emergency medical services, from rural EMS \nproviders, to communications between EMS systems, to improving \ncoordination between local EMS providers and their Federal partners.\n  Another recent GAO report made it clear that the Center for Medicare \nand Medicaid Services needs to better coordinate its reimbursement with \nthe Department of Transportation's matching grants for equipment and \nvehicles. Many of Maine's rural communities, such as Rumford, are at \nrisk of seeing their first ambulance service closures due to low-\nreimbursement rates. If DOT targeted assistance to the low \nreimbursement areas that are at risk of shutting down, we might be able \nto maintain service in these areas.\n  Decisions at the Federal Communications Commission regarding spectrum \nmanagement could make most of the existing EMS and Fire radios obsolete \nover the next few years. In St. George, Maine, the volunteer Fire \nRescue has 30 mobile and portable radios, 40 pagers, and a base station \nthat could become obsolete. In making future decisions regarding \nspectrum management, the FCC must work with Department of Homeland \nSecurity and the Department of Justice to help communities purchase \ninteroperable radios if their old ones become obsolete.\n  I am pleased to have the support of Maine EMS, LifeFlight of Maine, \nthe American Ambulance Association, the National Association of EMS \nDirectors, and others for this legislation.\n  We must ensure that Federal agencies coordinate their efforts to \nsupport the dedicated men and women who provide EMS services across our \nNation. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting their efforts by \ncosponsoring this legislation.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from \nMaine, Senator Collins, today to introduce legislation that will help \nimprove and streamline Federal support for community-based emergency \nmedical services. Our proposal will also provide an avenue for local \nofficials and EMS providers to help Federal agencies improve existing \nprograms and future initiatives.\n  Congress has long recognized the important role played by EMS \nproviders. However, Federal support for EMS has been unfocused and \nuncoordinated, with responsibility scattered among a number of \ndifferent agencies. In 2001, the General Accounting Office cited the \nneed to increase coordination between the federal agencies involved \nwith EMS issues but not much progress has been made since that report \nwas issued. The Federal Government doesn't even have a good handle on \nhow much it is spending on EMS or what the needs are for EMS. The bill \nwe introduce today is a good first step towards addressing the \ndeficiencies in our current EMS policies.\n  This legislation establishes a federal interagency committee whose \npurpose will be to coordinate federal EMS activities, identify EMS \nneeds, assure proper integration of EMS in homeland security planning, \nand make recommendations on improving and streamlining EMS support. \nAlthough Federal law, PL 107-188, called for the establishment of a \nworking group on EMS, this legislation goes further in detailing the \nrole and function of the interagency committee. The Senate Governmental \nAffairs Committee will certainly iron out any overlap that may exist.\n  This legislation also establishes an advisory council for the \ninteragency committee that includes representatives from throughout the \nEMS community. The advisory committee, made up of non-Federal \nrepresentatives from all EMS sectors and from both urban and rural \nareas, will provide guidance and input to the interagency committee on \na variety of issues including the development of standards and national \nplans, expanding or creating grant programs, and improving and \nstreamlining Federal EMS efforts. The advisory council is a critical \ncomponent of this legislation because it is the channel through which \nlocal EMS practitioners can directly impact and help reform national \nEMS policy.\n  I want to thank the American Ambulance Association, the Association \nof Air Medical Services, the Emergency Nurses Association, the National \nAssociation of EMS Physicians, the National Association of State EMS \nDirectors, and the National Registry of EMTs for their support of this \nbill. I also want to thank all of those Wisconsinites who provided so \nmuch helpful input in coming up with this legislation. In particular, I \nwould like to thank Dr. Marvin Birnbaum of the University of Wisconsin, \nFire Chief Dave Bloom of the Town of Madison, and Dan Williams, chair \nof Wisconsin's EMS advisory board for their advice and guidance.\n  EMS providers are a critical component of our Nation's first \nresponder network. We must act now to streamline and coordinate federal \nEMS support and work to better understand the needs of the EMS \ncommunity. I therefore ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ENSIGN (for himself, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. \n        Inouye, and Ms. Collins):\n  S. 2352. A bill to prevent the slaughter of horses in and from the \nUnited States for human consumption by prohibiting the slaughter of \nhorses for human consumption and by prohibiting the trade and transport \nof horselflesh and live horses intended for human consumption, and for \nother purposes;\n\n[[Page S4433]]\n\nto the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise along with my colleagues, Senators \nlandrieu, Lieberman, Inouye and Collins, in order to introduce S. 2352, \nthe American Horse Slaughter Prevention Act.\n  As a veterinarian, I am well aware of the love that Americans have \nfor their horses. Much of our Nation's early history and culture is \nassociated with these animals. We think of George Washington's horses \nand the legend of Paul Revere's ride and the Pony Express. And more \nrecently, we were reminded of how the Depression Era race between \nSeabiscuit and War Admiral raised the spirit of our Nation.\n  While horses in the United States are not raised for food, last year \nalone, almost 50,000 horses were slaughtered in the United States for \nhuman consumption abroad. Pet horses, ex-racing horses, workhorses and \neven some federally protected wild horses are currently being \nslaughtered for human consumption in Europe and Asia. A series of \nrecent polls show that Americans overwhelmingly support a ban on the \nslaughter of horses for human consumption.\n  Often, owners who sell their horses at auction are unaware that their \nhorses may well be on their way to one of the two remaining \nslaughterhouses in America where horses are killed for human \nconsumption. These slaughterhouses are foreign owned and the product is \nshipped abroad as are the profits.\n  States have tried to be proactive in preventing this form of \nslaughter in the United States. Several States have already enacted \nstate laws prohibiting the slaughter of horses for human consumption. \nSeveral other States are currently considering similar legislation. \nHowever, due to the absence of a Federal law on this subject, the two \nexisting foreign-owned slaughterhouses, which happen to be located in \nTexas--a State that has passed a law banning horse slaughter for human \nconsumption--have still been able to operate.\n  I know that some people have expressed concern about what will happen \nto horses if slaughter is banned. Many of these horses will be sold to \na new owner, others may be kept longer, and still others will be \nhumanely euthanized by a licensed veterinarian. Others will be cared \nfor by the horse rescue community. The American Horse Slaughter \nPrevention Act does allow fines collected under the Act to be \ndistributed to qualified horse rescue groups caring for horses \nconfiscated under the Act.\n  Some people have questioned whether this law will result in the abuse \nand neglect of unwanted horses. Thankfully, statistics do not support \nthis claim at all. Recently released figures show that the number of \nabuse cases dropped significantly in Illinois after the State's only \nhorse slaughtering facility was destroyed in a fire in 2002. Also, \nsince California passed a law banning the slaughter of horses for human \nconsumption, there has been no discernible increase in cruelty and \nneglect cases in the State.\n  Futhermore, it is currently illegal to ``turn out,'' neglect, or \nstarve a horse, so this bill will not result in an increase in the \nnumber of orphaned horses in the United States. If a person attempts to \nturn his or her horses out, under current law, animal control agents \nwill be able to enforce Federal humane laws. As I stated before, this \nbill seeks only to prohibit the slaughter of horses for human \nconsumption. If a person wishes to put an animal down, it costs an \naverage of $50 to $150 to have the horse humanely euthanized and \ndisposed of--a fraction of what it costs to keep a horse as a companion \nor a work animal. That cost is not too big a burden to bear when no \nother options are available.\n  The time for a strong Federal law banning this practice is now. This \nbill does not target other forms of slaughter, rendering, or euthanasia \nbut rather focuses solely on the slaughter of American horses for human \nconsumption. The House version of this bill, H.R. 857, currently has \ntwo hundred cosponsors. Please join Senator Landrieu and me in \ncosponsoring the American Horse Slaughter Prevention Act.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, today I join my colleagues in \nintroducing the American Horse Slaughter Prevention Act. This bill will \nprohibit the slaughter of horses for human consumption, a practice \nwhich many Americans oppose and of which many more are completely \nunaware. As a life-long admirer of these beautiful and noble animals, I \nwas shocked to learn that tens of thousands of horses are slaughtered \nand exported each year for human consumption in other countries. Aside \nfrom the fact that there is virtually no demand for the human \nconsumption of horse flesh in this country, the absence of humane \ntreatment of these horses is very disappointing. We must ensure that \nthis beloved animal is treated in an appropriate manner and that this \ndeplorable act, which many Americans find unconscionable, is prohibited \nunder Federal law. Therefore, I am proud to join my colleagues as a \ncosponsor of this legislation. I would like to take this opportunity to \nhighlight a few issues about this important measure.\n  The need for the humane euthanasia of horses is a sad reality for all \nhorse owners. Each horse's life has inherent value and it is usually \nwith great sadness and care that horse owners face the realities of \ninfirmity, age, or other reasons which call for the putting down of \ntheir animal. However, the current practice of horse slaughter is void \nof the human compassion involved with appropriate euthanasia. The \nexport of horses for slaughter and the slaughter of horses in the \nUnited States by unskilled and careless workers increase the suffering \nof these animals. These slaughter houses appear uninterested in the \nwelfare of these animals, and take little note of the objections of the \nmillions of Americans who find the consumption of horse flesh to be \ninappropriate.\n  Throughout the development of this country, the human consumption of \nhorse flesh has never been a widely accepted activity. This societal \ntaboo is undoubtably due to the unique relationship enjoyed between \nmankind and horses for thousands of years. Horses have tread many steps \nwith American men and women. They were there in our work, on our farms, \nfor transportation and communication, in the taming of a vast American \nfrontier, and on every battlefield prior to World War II. They have \nproven themselves loyal and gentle animals, without which the \ndevelopment of our country may not have been possible and certainly \nmuch more difficult. Horses demand the basic humane treatment that we \nshould extend to all of God's creatures, and above that--our society \nhas developed a heightened sense of respect and love for these \nindispensable animals. In modern times, horses have brought joy and \nentertainment to many. Through racing, recreation and even therapy to \nthe handicapped, horses have touched the lives of many Americans. \nClearly, they hold a special place in our lives and it is for these \nreasons that so many are strongly opposed to the slaughter of horses in \nthis country for human consumption.\n  I am very encouraged by the leadership and hard work of Senator \nEnsign, who is himself a veterinarian. His expertise in this issue has \nbrought many groups together in support of this legislation, and has \nfacilitated understanding of the bill's provisions. Having garnered \nbroad support in the House of Representatives, I am firmly committed to \nseeing that this bill is brought to the attention of all of our \ncolleagues here in the Senate. I look forward to working with Senator \nENSIGN and other colleagues, to ensure that we address these important \nissues and pass a common sense bill that reflects the desires of many \nof our constituents, who support the humane treatment of horses and the \nprohibition of their slaughter for human consumption.\n\n[[Page S4434]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/27/senate-section/article/S4430-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4430-S4434]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. LIEBERMAN (for himself, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Dodd, and Mr. \n        Schumer):\n  S. 2350. A bill to establish the Long island Sound Stewardship \nSystem; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, Long Island Sound holds a special place \nin our Nation's history, its present, and its future. It has played a \nkey role in the development of the Nation, from the early days of the \ncolonists, through to this day. Its bounty nourished the colonists, its \ncoves sheltered their ships, and provided harbors for trade.\n  Today, Long Island Sound remains a vital resource to the area: its \nbiological resources provide jobs, and its beauty draws tourists who \ncome to visit the Sound to fish, to sail, and simply to enjoy its \nshores. It is estimated that these activities contribute approximately \n$5 billion annually to the economy of the region. This is not so \nsurprising when you realize that over 28 million people live within 50 \nmiles of the Sound.\n  It is a blessing that so many people can enjoy and benefit from Long \nIsland Sound, in so many ways. But it is also a challenge that \nthreatens the future of the Sound. Less than 20 percent of the \nshoreline of Long Island Sound is accessible to the public, and every \nyear, more shoreline is developed and removed from public access. \nMarshes and estuaries around the Sound are being drained and developed \nat an alarming rate. These tidal marshes are critical for the \necological health of the Sound, which is the foundation of the Sound's \nvital economic contribution to the region. In short, to preserve the \nblessings of Long Island Sound for future generations, this generation \nmust act. This is why Senator Clinton and I have introduced the Long \nIsland Sound Stewardship Act.\n  The Long Island Sound Stewardship Act builds on the years of good \nwork done by the Long Island Sound Study Group. This group, made up of \ndedicated people from Federal, State, and local government agencies, \nnon-government organizations, and private interests, has worked \ntogether to develop a vision of good stewardship for Long Island Sound. \nMany of them are here today, and I thank them for their hard work.\n  Our bill will help us achieve their vision, by providing funds and a \ncongressional mandate to work towards this vision. Under this bill, \nthose who agree to preserve public access or ecological characteristics \nof their land can be recognized by having the land designated as a Long \nIsland Stewardship Site. The bill also provides funding to facilitate \nthe preservation of these characteristics. Most important, the bill \nachieves these ends through a voluntary program, a cooperative venture \nbetween all the stakeholders: public and private, Federal, State, and \nlocal.\n  The Long Island Sound Study has already set a fine example of \ncooperation and vision. I introduce this bill to further that vision. I \nlook forward to working with the Connecticut and New York delegations, \nand all the stakeholders, as we develop and refine this bill. I am \nconfident that working together, we will preserve the blessings of Long \nIsland Sound.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Long Island Sound \nStewardship Act be printed in the record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2350\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Long Island Sound \n     Stewardship Act of 2004''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) Long Island Sound is a national treasure of great \n     cultural, environmental, and ecological importance;\n       (2) 8,000,000 people live within the Long Island Sound \n     watershed and 28,000,000 people (approximately 10 percent of \n     the population of the United States) live within 50 miles of \n     Long Island Sound;\n       (3) activities that depend on the environmental health of \n     Long Island Sound contribute more than $5,000,000,000 each \n     year to the regional economy;\n       (4) the portion of the shoreline of Long Island Sound that \n     is accessible to the general public (estimated at less than \n     20 percent of the total shoreline) is not adequate to serve \n     the needs of the people living in the area;\n       (5) existing shoreline facilities are in many cases \n     overburdened and underfunded;\n       (6) large parcels of open space already in public ownership \n     are strained by the effort to balance the demand for \n     recreation with the needs of sensitive natural resources;\n       (7) approximately \\1/3\\ of the tidal marshes of Long Island \n     Sound have been filled, and much of the remaining marshes \n     have been ditched, dyked, or impounded, reducing the \n     ecological value of the marshes; and\n       (8) many of the remaining exemplary natural landscape is \n     vulnerable to further development.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to establish the \n     Long Island Sound Stewardship System to preserve areas of \n     critical importance because of the open space, public access, \n     and ecological value of the areas.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to establish a Federal Interagency Committee on \nEmergency Medical Services and a Federal Interagency Committee on \nEmergency Medical Services Advisory Council, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Emergency \nMedical Services Support Act of 2004 with my colleague, Senator Russ \nFeingold. This legislation will strengthen Federal efforts to support \ncommunity-based emergency medical services across America.\n\n[[Page S4432]]\n\n  A comprehensive, coordinated emergency medical services system is \nessential to assure quality care and prompt response in incidents \nranging from automobile crashes to catastrophic weather to terrorist \nattacks. The emergency medical services system is a crucial part of our \nhealth care safety net.\n  Unfortunately, for the past twenty years, Federal support for EMS has \nbeen both inefficient and uncoordinated. No fewer than seven Federal \nagencies are involved in various aspects of emergency medical services. \nMost, however, focus on only one segment of the EMS system and don't \neffectively coordinate with other agencies.\n  In 2001, at the request of Senator Feingold and myself, the General \nAccounting Office researched the status of this vital system. The GAO \nreport, titled, ``Emergency Medical Services: Reported needs are Wide-\nRanging with a Growing Focus on Lack of Data,'' exposed the need to \nincrease coordination among Federal agencies as they address the needs \nof regional, State, or local emergency medical services systems.\n  This legislation would formally establish a Federal Interagency \nCommittee on Emergency Medical Services (FICEMS), which is currently an \nad-hoc committee with little formal direction. It would require the \nNational Highway Traffic Safety Administration, in coordination with \nthe Department of Homeland Security, to provide organizational and \nstaff support.\n  This legislation would enhance coordination among the Federal \nagencies involved with the State, local, tribal and regional emergency \nmedical services and 9-1-1 systems. It also would help Federal agencies \ncoordinate their EMS-related activities and maximize the best use of \nestablished funding.\n  The President has recognized the need for this coordination. He \nincluded a similar proposal in his reauthorization proposal for the \n``Safe, Accountable, Flexible, and Efficient Transportation Equity act \nof 2003'' (SAFETEA) that was transmitted by Secretary Mineta to \nCongress on May 12, 2003. The Senate-passed highway bill also included \na similar proposal.\n  The legislation we introduce today builds upon the Administration's \nproposal by creating a more effective structure and enhancing the role \nof local EMS providers into Federal EMS programs. While I support the \nprovisions in the Senate-passed bill, they fail to create a mechanism \nfor individuals at the state and local levels to provide input into how \nFederal EMS programs should be coordinated.\n  Local, State and Federal level emergency medical services systems are \nextremely diverse and involve numerous different agencies and \norganizations. To assure a viable, responsive emergency medical \nservices system, Federal agencies need the input and advice of their \nnon-Federal partners and from persons regulating or providing emergency \nmedical services systems at the state and local level.\n  According to Tom Judge, the Executive Director of Lifeflight of \nMaine, an air ambulance provider, and Jay Bradshaw, the State of \nMaine's EMS Director, improved coordination can help strengthen support \nfor a wide range of emergency medical services, from rural EMS \nproviders, to communications between EMS systems, to improving \ncoordination between local EMS providers and their Federal partners.\n  Another recent GAO report made it clear that the Center for Medicare \nand Medicaid Services needs to better coordinate its reimbursement with \nthe Department of Transportation's matching grants for equipment and \nvehicles. Many of Maine's rural communities, such as Rumford, are at \nrisk of seeing their first ambulance service closures due to low-\nreimbursement rates. If DOT targeted assistance to the low \nreimbursement areas that are at risk of shutting down, we might be able \nto maintain service in these areas.\n  Decisions at the Federal Communications Commission regarding spectrum \nmanagement could make most of the existing EMS and Fire radios obsolete \nover the next few years. In St. George, Maine, the volunteer Fire \nRescue has 30 mobile and portable radios, 40 pagers, and a base station \nthat could become obsolete. In making future decisions regarding \nspectrum management, the FCC must work with Department of Homeland \nSecurity and the Department of Justice to help communities purchase \ninteroperable radios if their old ones become obsolete.\n  I am pleased to have the support of Maine EMS, LifeFlight of Maine, \nthe American Ambulance Association, the National Association of EMS \nDirectors, and others for this legislation.\n  We must ensure that Federal agencies coordinate their efforts to \nsupport the dedicated men and women who provide EMS services across our \nNation. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting their efforts by \ncosponsoring this legislation.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from \nMaine, Senator Collins, today to introduce legislation that will help \nimprove and streamline Federal support for community-based emergency \nmedical services. Our proposal will also provide an avenue for local \nofficials and EMS providers to help Federal agencies improve existing \nprograms and future initiatives.\n  Congress has long recognized the important role played by EMS \nproviders. However, Federal support for EMS has been unfocused and \nuncoordinated, with responsibility scattered among a number of \ndifferent agencies. In 2001, the General Accounting Office cited the \nneed to increase coordination between the federal agencies involved \nwith EMS issues but not much progress has been made since that report \nwas issued. The Federal Government doesn't even have a good handle on \nhow much it is spending on EMS or what the needs are for EMS. The bill \nwe introduce today is a good first step towards addressing the \ndeficiencies in our current EMS policies.\n  This legislation establishes a federal interagency committee whose \npurpose will be to coordinate federal EMS activities, identify EMS \nneeds, assure proper integration of EMS in homeland security planning, \nand make recommendations on improving and streamlining EMS support. \nAlthough Federal law, PL 107-188, called for the establishment of a \nworking group on EMS, this legislation goes further in detailing the \nrole and function of the interagency committee. The Senate Governmental \nAffairs Committee will certainly iron out any overlap that may exist.\n  This legislation also establishes an advisory council for the \ninteragency committee that includes representatives from throughout the \nEMS community. The advisory committee, made up of non-Federal \nrepresentatives from all EMS sectors and from both urban and rural \nareas, will provide guidance and input to the interagency committee on \na variety of issues including the development of standards and national \nplans, expanding or creating grant programs, and improving and \nstreamlining Federal EMS efforts. The advisory council is a critical \ncomponent of this legislation because it is the channel through which \nlocal EMS practitioners can directly impact and help reform national \nEMS policy.\n  I want to thank the American Ambulance Association, the Association \nof Air Medical Services, the Emergency Nurses Association, the National \nAssociation of EMS Physicians, the National Association of State EMS \nDirectors, and the National Registry of EMTs for their support of this \nbill. I also want to thank all of those Wisconsinites who provided so \nmuch helpful input in coming up with this legislation. In particular, I \nwould like to thank Dr. Marvin Birnbaum of the University of Wisconsin, \nFire Chief Dave Bloom of the Town of Madison, and Dan Williams, chair \nof Wisconsin's EMS advisory board for their advice and guidance.\n  EMS providers are a critical component of our Nation's first \nresponder network. We must act now to streamline and coordinate federal \nEMS support and work to better understand the needs of the EMS \ncommunity. I therefore ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ENSIGN (for himself, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. \n        Inouye, and Ms. Collins):\n  S. 2352. A bill to prevent the slaughter of horses in and from the \nUnited States for human consumption by prohibiting the slaughter of \nhorses for human consumption and by prohibiting the trade and transport \nof horselflesh and live horses intended for human consumption, and for \nother purposes;\n\n[[Page S4433]]\n\nto the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise along with my colleagues, Senators \nlandrieu, Lieberman, Inouye and Collins, in order to introduce S. 2352, \nthe American Horse Slaughter Prevention Act.\n  As a veterinarian, I am well aware of the love that Americans have \nfor their horses. Much of our Nation's early history and culture is \nassociated with these animals. We think of George Washington's horses \nand the legend of Paul Revere's ride and the Pony Express. And more \nrecently, we were reminded of how the Depression Era race between \nSeabiscuit and War Admiral raised the spirit of our Nation.\n  While horses in the United States are not raised for food, last year \nalone, almost 50,000 horses were slaughtered in the United States for \nhuman consumption abroad. Pet horses, ex-racing horses, workhorses and \neven some federally protected wild horses are currently being \nslaughtered for human consumption in Europe and Asia. A series of \nrecent polls show that Americans overwhelmingly support a ban on the \nslaughter of horses for human consumption.\n  Often, owners who sell their horses at auction are unaware that their \nhorses may well be on their way to one of the two remaining \nslaughterhouses in America where horses are killed for human \nconsumption. These slaughterhouses are foreign owned and the product is \nshipped abroad as are the profits.\n  States have tried to be proactive in preventing this form of \nslaughter in the United States. Several States have already enacted \nstate laws prohibiting the slaughter of horses for human consumption. \nSeveral other States are currently considering similar legislation. \nHowever, due to the absence of a Federal law on this subject, the two \nexisting foreign-owned slaughterhouses, which happen to be located in \nTexas--a State that has passed a law banning horse slaughter for human \nconsumption--have still been able to operate.\n  I know that some people have expressed concern about what will happen \nto horses if slaughter is banned. Many of these horses will be sold to \na new owner, others may be kept longer, and still others will be \nhumanely euthanized by a licensed veterinarian. Others will be cared \nfor by the horse rescue community. The American Horse Slaughter \nPrevention Act does allow fines collected under the Act to be \ndistributed to qualified horse rescue groups caring for horses \nconfiscated under the Act.\n  Some people have questioned whether this law will result in the abuse \nand neglect of unwanted horses. Thankfully, statistics do not support \nthis claim at all. Recently released figures show that the number of \nabuse cases dropped significantly in Illinois after the State's only \nhorse slaughtering facility was destroyed in a fire in 2002. Also, \nsince California passed a law banning the slaughter of horses for human \nconsumption, there has been no discernible increase in cruelty and \nneglect cases in the State.\n  Futhermore, it is currently illegal to ``turn out,'' neglect, or \nstarve a horse, so this bill will not result in an increase in the \nnumber of orphaned horses in the United States. If a person attempts to \nturn his or her horses out, under current law, animal control agents \nwill be able to enforce Federal humane laws. As I stated before, this \nbill seeks only to prohibit the slaughter of horses for human \nconsumption. If a person wishes to put an animal down, it costs an \naverage of $50 to $150 to have the horse humanely euthanized and \ndisposed of--a fraction of what it costs to keep a horse as a companion \nor a work animal. That cost is not too big a burden to bear when no \nother options are available.\n  The time for a strong Federal law banning this practice is now. This \nbill does not target other forms of slaughter, rendering, or euthanasia \nbut rather focuses solely on the slaughter of American horses for human \nconsumption. The House version of this bill, H.R. 857, currently has \ntwo hundred cosponsors. Please join Senator Landrieu and me in \ncosponsoring the American Horse Slaughter Prevention Act.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, today I join my colleagues in \nintroducing the American Horse Slaughter Prevention Act. This bill will \nprohibit the slaughter of horses for human consumption, a practice \nwhich many Americans oppose and of which many more are completely \nunaware. As a life-long admirer of these beautiful and noble animals, I \nwas shocked to learn that tens of thousands of horses are slaughtered \nand exported each year for human consumption in other countries. Aside \nfrom the fact that there is virtually no demand for the human \nconsumption of horse flesh in this country, the absence of humane \ntreatment of these horses is very disappointing. We must ensure that \nthis beloved animal is treated in an appropriate manner and that this \ndeplorable act, which many Americans find unconscionable, is prohibited \nunder Federal law. Therefore, I am proud to join my colleagues as a \ncosponsor of this legislation. I would like to take this opportunity to \nhighlight a few issues about this important measure.\n  The need for the humane euthanasia of horses is a sad reality for all \nhorse owners. Each horse's life has inherent value and it is usually \nwith great sadness and care that horse owners face the realities of \ninfirmity, age, or other reasons which call for the putting down of \ntheir animal. However, the current practice of horse slaughter is void \nof the human compassion involved with appropriate euthanasia. The \nexport of horses for slaughter and the slaughter of horses in the \nUnited States by unskilled and careless workers increase the suffering \nof these animals. These slaughter houses appear uninterested in the \nwelfare of these animals, and take little note of the objections of the \nmillions of Americans who find the consumption of horse flesh to be \ninappropriate.\n  Throughout the development of this country, the human consumption of \nhorse flesh has never been a widely accepted activity. This societal \ntaboo is undoubtably due to the unique relationship enjoyed between \nmankind and horses for thousands of years. Horses have tread many steps \nwith American men and women. They were there in our work, on our farms, \nfor transportation and communication, in the taming of a vast American \nfrontier, and on every battlefield prior to World War II. They have \nproven themselves loyal and gentle animals, without which the \ndevelopment of our country may not have been possible and certainly \nmuch more difficult. Horses demand the basic humane treatment that we \nshould extend to all of God's creatures, and above that--our society \nhas developed a heightened sense of respect and love for these \nindispensable animals. In modern times, horses have brought joy and \nentertainment to many. Through racing, recreation and even therapy to \nthe handicapped, horses have touched the lives of many Americans. \nClearly, they hold a special place in our lives and it is for these \nreasons that so many are strongly opposed to the slaughter of horses in \nthis country for human consumption.\n  I am very encouraged by the leadership and hard work of Senator \nEnsign, who is himself a veterinarian. His expertise in this issue has \nbrought many groups together in support of this legislation, and has \nfacilitated understanding of the bill's provisions. Having garnered \nbroad support in the House of Representatives, I am firmly committed to \nseeing that this bill is brought to the attention of all of our \ncolleagues here in the Senate. I look forward to working with Senator \nENSIGN and other colleagues, to ensure that we address these important \nissues and pass a common sense bill that reflects the desires of many \nof our constituents, who support the humane treatment of horses and the \nprohibition of their slaughter for human consumption.\n\n[[Page S4434]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/27/senate-section/article/S4434-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4434]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 343--CALLING ON THE GOVERNMENT OF THE SOCIALIST \nREPUBLIC OF VIETNAM TO RESPECT ALL UNIVERSALLY RECOGNIZED HUMAN RIGHTS, \n   INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO FREEDOM OF RELIGION AND TO PARTICIPATE IN \n     RELIGIOUS ACTIVITIES AND INSTITUTIONS WITHOUT INTERFERENCE OR \n   INVOLVEMENT OF THE GOVERNMENT; AND TO RESPECT THE HUMAN RIGHTS OF \n   ETHNIC MINORITY GROUPS IN THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS AND ELSEWHERE IN \n                                VIETNAM\n\n  Mr. LUGAR (for himself, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Hagel, and Mr. Allen) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S.

Con. Res. 100\n\n       Whereas the Republic of South Africa peacefully and \n     successfully held democratic elections and transitioned to a \n     democratic, nonracial form of government in 1994;\n       Whereas South Africa helped initiate and frame the New \n     Partnership for Africa's Development and continues to head \n     this partnership for development and responsible leadership \n     in Africa;\n       Whereas South Africa actively supports the South African \n     Development Community, which promotes regional economic \n     cooperation and higher standards of living in Southern \n     Africa;\n       Whereas South Africa has made significant advances in \n     housing by constructing 1,600,000 houses for the poor of \n     South Africa;\n       Whereas, since 1994, 9,000,000 people in South Africa have \n     gained access to clean water;\n       Whereas, before 1994, 22,000,000 people in South Africa did \n     not have access to adequate sanitation, but 63 percent of \n     households in South Africa now have access to adequate \n     sanitation;\n       Whereas, before 1994, 60 percent of people in South Africa \n     did not have electricity, but more than 70 percent of \n     households in South Africa now have electricity;\n       Whereas, from 1994 to 2004, secondary school enrollment in \n     South Africa increased from 70 percent to 85 percent, and \n     students in South Africa now learn in a racially integrated \n     school system;\n       Whereas the Government of South Africa has established \n     nutritional and educational programs to benefit the youngest \n     and poorest people in South Africa;\n       Whereas South Africa is experiencing the longest period of \n     consistent positive growth, as measured by its gross domestic \n     product (GDP), since growth in GDP was properly recorded in \n     the 1940s;\n       Whereas F.W. de Klerk and Nelson Mandela share a Nobel \n     Peace Prize for their work in ending apartheid in South \n     Africa and establishing a representative government;\n       Whereas Desmond Tutu led the Truth and Reconciliation \n     Commission to repair injustices among South Africans and \n     improve race relations in the country, and was awarded a \n     Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts;\n       Whereas South Africa has contributed troops to peacekeeping \n     efforts in Burundi, Liberia, the Democratic Republic of the \n     Congo, Ethiopia, and Eritrea;\n       Whereas South Africa President Thabo Mbeki has forged a \n     relationship with President George W.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 10th \nanniversary of majority rule in the Republic of South Africa and to \ncommend the South African people for the momentous social and economic \nachievements they have made since establishing a more inclusive \ndemocracy. We all remember that just ten years ago South Africa held \nits first democratic, non-racial election on April 27, 1994. This \nmomentous event, along with the subsequent inauguration of Nelson \nMandela as President, later in May, signaled the death knell of \napartheid and the re-birth of South Africa as a more representative, \nnon-discriminatory democracy. The struggle to end apartheid in South \nAfrica captured the imagination and garnered the support of millions of \npeoples worldwide, including the people of the United States.\n  In August 2003, my wife, Honey, and I spent a few days in South \nAfrica as part of a Congressional Delegation led by our Majority \nLeader, Senator Bill Frist. While there, we toured Robben Island, the \nprison island where Nelson Mandela was jailed for twenty-seven years. \nIt was a humbling and inspiring experience to walk the grounds and know \nthat despite his imprisonment in this desolate jail, Mandela could \nemerge without bitterness or hate and advocate unity and peaceful \nchange as he worked with then President F.W. de Klerk to end apartheid \nand establish a representative democracy, for which efforts both men \nreceived the Nobel Prize in 1993.\n  Traveling through Cape Town, Johannesburg, and Soweto, and meeting \nwith both white and black South Africans reminded me how far South \nAfrica has come in its social transformation, which has improved the \nlives of millions. In 1994, 22 million South Africans did not have \naccess to adequate sanitation and 60 percent of South Africans did not \nhave electricity. Now, 63 percent of South African households have\n\n[[Page S4435]]\n\naccess to sanitation, more than 70 percent of households have \nelectricity, and 9 million people have gained access to clean water \nsince 1994.\n  However, my visit to South Africa also underscored that South Africa \nstill faces daunting challenges that threaten to undo the gains it has \nmade since 1994. First, and foremost, the most pressing issue facing \nnot only South Africa, but also all of sub-Saharan Africa, remains HIV/\nAIDS. The 2003 announcement by the Mbeki government that it would soon \nbegin providing antiretroviral treatment on a national scale to South \nAfricans living with AIDS was an important step. President Mbeki was \nslow to come to this decision, and I hope now he will move forward with \ngreater commitment. The South African government must persevere in \ncombating the challenge of HIV/AIDS by making a strong political \ncommitment and by expanding its prevention and treatment programs, such \nas the impressive ones that I visited during my time there.\n  Also facing South Africa and its neighbors is the economic and \nhumanitarian crisis caused by Robert Mugabe's despotic regime in nearby \nZimbabwe. I have spoken on this floor before to condemn President \nMugabe's brutal oppression of his own people, and it is imperative that \nSouth Africa take a lead role among the international community in \nagitating for real change in practices of the Zimbabwean government.\n  Nelson Mandela aptly said, ``It is better to lead from behind and to \nput others in front, especially when you celebrate victory when nice \nthings occur. You take the front line where there is danger. Then \npeople will appreciate your leadership.'' Now is the proper time to \ncelebrate the anniversary of South Africa's transition to an inclusive \ndemocracy, and we all look forward to South Africa taking a stronger \nleadership role on the front lines against the twin dangers of HIV/AIDS \nin Sub-Saharan Africa and the oppressive regime of Robert Mugabe.\n  To that end, today I submit a resolution to commemorate this \nimportant event. I'm proud to be joined in this effort by Senator \nFeingold, the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Africa Affairs, \nwhich I chair, Senator Lugar, the Chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, and Senator Biden, the Ranking Member of the Foreign \nRelations Committee. Senator Feingold has been an active leader on \nAfrican issues throughout his tenure in the Senate, and I have been \nprivileged to serve with him on our Subcommittee. Chairman Lugar and \nSenator Biden were both leaders on the issue of sanctions against the \napartheid regime of South Africa in the 1980's and early '90's. I hope \nthey feel a sense of satisfaction, today, in celebrating ten years of \nsuccessful majority rule since the peaceful end of that regime.\n  Today is Freedom Day in South Africa, a day to celebrate the end of \napartheid, and the beginning of majority rule in that country. I hope \nmy colleagues will join me in supporting this resolution to commemorate \nthat event.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/27/senate-section/article/S4435-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4435]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3048.

and\n       (B) the use of MTBE would likely be important to the cost-\n     effective implementation of that standard;\n       (4) Congress is aware that gasoline and its component \n     additives have leaked from storage tanks, with consequences \n     for water quality;\n       (5) the fuel industry responded to the fuel oxygenate \n     standard established by Public Law 101-549 by making \n     substantial investments in--\n       (A) MTBE production capacity; and\n       (B) systems to deliver MTBE-containing gasoline to the \n     marketplace;\n       (6) when leaked or spilled into the environment, MTBE may \n     cause serious problems of drinking water quality;\n       (7) in recent years, MTBE has been detected in water \n     sources throughout the United States;\n       (8) MTBE can be detected by smell and taste at low \n     concentrations;\n\n[[Page S4440]]\n\n       (9) while small quantities of MTBE can render water \n     supplies unpalatable, the precise human health effects of \n     MTBE consumption at low levels are yet unknown as of the date \n     of enactment of this Act;\n       (10) in the report entitled ``Achieving Clean Air and Clean \n     Water: The Report of the Blue Ribbon Panel on Oxygenates in \n     Gasoline'' and dated September 1999, Congress was urged--\n       (A) to eliminate the fuel oxygenate standard;\n       (B) to greatly reduce use of MTBE;

and\n       (B) for the purpose of mitigating any fuel supply problems \n     that may result from elimination of a widely-used fuel \n     additive.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this section are--\n       (1) to eliminate use of MTBE as a fuel oxygenate;
