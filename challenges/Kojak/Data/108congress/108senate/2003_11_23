Today, the Senate will resume debate on the Medicare \nprescription drug conference report. We had an extended and vigorous \ndebate on this historic legislation yesterday. Again, it is unusual to \nhave a Saturday session and even more unusual to have a Sunday session, \nbut the historic level which this debate has reached demonstrates the \nimportance of doing just that.\n  There are a number of Senators who will be on the Senate floor to \ndiscuss this matter during today's session, and in an effort to \naccommodate the number of Senators who are seeking floor time today, we \nwould encourage Members to limit their statements to no more than 30 \nminutes. We hope to work out a schedule so that Members will have a \nbetter understanding of at what point in the day or the evening they \nwill be able to speak. If we can lock in 30 minutes per Member, or \npossibly work out alternating hours, which we will do, hopefully, in a \nfew minutes, we will then have an orderly way to move forward so that \neverybody will have an opportunity to address this important issue.\n  Yesterday, it became apparent that we would not be able to lock in a \ntime certain for an up-or-down vote on this important legislation, and \nat least one Democratic Member said that a filibuster would be the road \nto pursue. Thus, I filed a cloture motion on the conference report. \nThat vote on the motion to invoke cloture is expected to occur sometime \naround 12:30 on Monday. All Senators will be notified when that vote is \nset.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/23/senate-section/article/S15592-3", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15592]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I share the view expressed by the \nmajority leader about the need for us to accommodate as many Senators \nas possible. It is my understanding that there is no objection to \nactually locking in a 30-minute time limit. Senators are free, of \ncourse, to ask unanimous consent to extend if they wish. So at this \ntime I propound that request.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senators be limited to no more than 30 \nminutes during the debate today.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I do not \nintend to object, I just want to clarify one matter. My understanding \nis, and it is printed in the calendar, that there is already an order \nof speakers that has been established. I want to make clear that that \nwill be recognized as we go forward today. I certainly will not object \nto the request of the distinguished minority leader. I just want to be \nclear that that will be the order of the speakers.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection to the original \nrequest?\n\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Reserving the right to object on the order, I was \nreferred to by my good friend, the majority leader, last evening at \nabout 6:15 in reference to this legislation. The time-honored tradition \nof this body is to notify an individual when there is going to be \nreference made to them. I was not notified, and I heard later last \nevening that I was referred to. I indicated that to the leader. I would \nlike to be able to do this in a timely way. I was listed yesterday to \nbe either third or fourth in order, but I am not prepared right now--if \nthere is some other previous order that has been arranged, I want to be \nable to reserve my rights that have been respected in this institution \nfor 220 years, and that is when a Senator is referred to in terms of \nlegislation, a fair opportunity is given for them to respond.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection to the original \nrequest?\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I hope that Senators would not ask to extend \nbeyond half an hour because it is so difficult to object. We have a lot \nof people. We have 17 on this side. Multiply that by half an hour and \none gets the figures. I hope everyone will stick by the half hour that \nwill be entered into, hopefully, momentarily.\n  I say to my friend from Massachusetts, the way the order is now set \non our side, the majority leader would speak first. I would speak \nsecond. I would be happy to change places with the Senator from \nMassachusetts so he can go second, and I will go sixth or seventh.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator from Nevada, as always, is more than kind \nand generous. I appreciate that very much. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection to changing the order \nas the Senator from Nevada requested? Without objection, it is so \nordered. The Senator from Massachusetts will take the place of the \nSenator from Nevada, and the Senator from Nevada will have the place in \nthe order of the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Is there objection to the minority leader's time limit of 30 minutes \nper speaker?\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, the list that is published in the \ncalendar only has Democratic Senators in it. Obviously, there is an \nalternative list that would allow for Republican Senators to have a 30-\nminute block in between the Democratic Senators who speak.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Parliamentarian informs me the Senator \nis correct, that a Republican Senator will go after each Democratic \nspeaker if someone is here to be recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Let me also clarify that on the Republican side we are not \nlocked into any order. The opponents to the bill are locked into an \norder of speakers. Ours has been just an agreement, so we are not \nlocked into any order, but there will be a 30-minute limit, and we will \nbe alternating back and forth.\n  Mr. BUNNING. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection to the minority \nleader's request? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who seeks time?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/23/senate-section/article/S15592-4", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15592]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of the conference report to accompany H.R. 1, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Conference report to accompany H.R. 1, an act to amend \n     Title XVIII of the Social Security Act to provide for a \n     voluntary prescription drug benefit under the Medicare \n     Program and to strengthen and improve the Medicare Program, \n     and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader is first on the list.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will certainly not exceed 30 minutes. I \nhope I can speak using less time because we are getting a little bit of \na late start.\n  Let me begin by saying what an important debate this is. This is a \ndebate the consequences of which will last for generations. This debate \nin many respects will be every bit as important as the debate on \nMedicare in 1965. One really has to go back to that year, 1965, to \nfully appreciate what we are debating now.\n  There was a debate, of course, in that period of our history, in the \nmid-1960s, about whether it was possible for us to address what was a \nnational embarrassment at the time. About half of all senior citizens \nin the early 1960s had no health insurance--none. They were left out. \nThere were horror stories about what they had to do in order to \naccommodate the health problems they were facing. It was a painful \nchapter. In\n\n[[Page S15593]]\n\nsome cases, because seniors had no health insurance, they were not \nliving as long, the quality of their lives could not have been worse, \nand they were the poorest of the poor. They often had no income other \nthan Social Security, and Social Security took them nowhere in regard \nto paying for the costs of health care.\n  Thanks to President Kennedy and then-President Johnson, the \nrecommendation was made that we provide a national health insurance \nplan for seniors. Republicans, at that time, argued that it was not the \nrole of Government, that it ought to be the private sector that \nprovides health insurance. Democrats argued, in response, that given \nthe group of people we were talking about, providing health insurance \nfor senior citizens in the private sector had about as much profit in \nit as providing insurance for a haircut. You are dealing with the \nsickest, most elderly in our population. So there is not much of a \nprofit incentive for insurers; there is not an incentive in terms of \nthe demographics and all of the actuarial circumstances. The private \nsector has virtually been loath to insure seniors because of that. It \nis like insuring a haircut. There is an inevitability, if you are a \nsenior, to that moment in one's life when illness becomes a serious \nthreat. And obviously, that is when the circumstances involving the end \nof life become all the more real.\n  Medicare stepped in. Now, over the last 40 years, it has been one of \nthe most successful programs in all of American history. Forty years of \nsuccess, 40 years of providing health care with a consistency and a \nconfidence we have never had in all of our time in this country.\n  My mother has benefits from Medicare. My mother benefits from Social \nSecurity. I can only imagine what it would be like today if she did not \nhave Medicare and Social Security upon which to depend.\n  So Republicans, over the last 40 years, have tried to find ways to go \nback to that debate of 1965 and say: We still believe in the private \nsector. We ought to be able to find a way to provide insurance for a \nhaircut and incentivize the private sector.\n  I will never forget the extraordinary statement made by the Speaker \nof the House, I believe it was in 1994. He addressed that very issue \nall over again when he said: It is still our hope and still our design \nto see Medicare wither on the vine.\n  For 40 years they have attempted to bring about an end, if not to \nMedicare itself, certainly to the concept of universal coverage through \nMedicare for all senior citizens.\n  That is really the backdrop that today we must recognize as we begin \nthe debate on this bill. How is it that those very colleagues who 40 \nyears ago argued that we really should not have a Government program \nfor universal coverage for health care, who just 10 years ago said we \nought to see Medicare wither on the vine, now in the name of Medicare \nare arguing we need to reform it, we need to improve it? We are not \nimproving it with this bill. We are not reforming it with this bill.\n  Does Medicare need to be changed? Of course. And providing a \nmeaningful prescription drug benefit is probably the single best reform \nwe could enact, because medicine itself has changed. But to those who \nsay we want Medicare to look more like the private sector, I say you \ndon't speak for me with that assertion.\n\n  Medicare has had about a 4 percent administrative cost over 40 years; \n96 percent of the money that goes into Medicare goes to benefits. Do \nyou know how that compares with the private sector? I am told the \naverage administrative cost in the private sector for insurance plans \nis not 4 percent. It is not even 10 percent. I am told the \nadministrative cost for a private sector plan today on the average is \nabout 15 percent--almost four times the administrative costs of \nMedicare.\n  So if you want to see the Medicare plan become more like a private \nplan, then count on spending almost four times more for administrative \ncosts. At most, 85 percent of premiums go to benefits in private sector \nplans.\n  How ironic that we find our colleagues saying: We want to make \nMedicare more like the private sector; we want more competition.\n  We don't mind competition. But the kind of competition they want \ndoesn't make a lot of sense to me. Why would we provide, instead of 96 \npercent of the benefits to the beneficiary, only 85 percent, and call \nthat progress?\n  To make Medicare more ``competitive,'' our colleagues want to give \nmore than $14 billion of incentives to the private sector to get them \nto insure a haircut. Their notion is that somehow we can find a way to \nmake the private sector more interested in providing meaningful health \ncare to seniors, when Medicare is doing it so well already.\n  There are a lot of very grave concerns we have about this \nlegislation. I brought some charts to the floor to talk about some of \nthese concerns. I want to address them, if I can, in the time I have \nallotted to me.\n  I think one of the biggest concerns I have is that seniors today are \nvery concerned about prices. They are concerned that their drug prices \ngo up each and every year.\n  I will never forget talking to a woman in Sioux Falls whose name is \nFlorence. She told me that, at 73 years old, she must work and she must \nuse the supplemental pay she gets from her job--at 73--simply to pay \nfor the drugs she needs. Her drug bill is about $400 a month. It goes \nup 10 to 15 percent every year.\n  She drives to Canada once every 3 months in order to save $100 a \nmonth. She figures every 3 months she saves enough to actually buy the \ndrugs for a month with that trip to Canada. So, without question, I \nthink most seniors are very concerned about what is going to happen to \nthe costs of their drugs.\n  The answer, with all of the specific analysis done to date about the \nimpact of this bill, the best analysis we can provide so far, is that \nup to 25 percent of all beneficiaries are actually going to pay more, \nnot less, for the drugs they buy with the passage of this bill--25 \npercent. It could be more than that.\n  Many Medicaid beneficiaries are going to pay more than what they are \npaying right now.\n  And there are many in the private sector who are going to pay more. \nYou are going to see several million Medicare beneficiarie who now have \nprivate coverage actually lose that coverage as a result of the passage \nof this bill. The estimate is now about 2.7 million senior citizens \nwill lose their retiree coverage when this legislation is enacted into \nlaw.\n  There are a number of other concerns we have with regard to this \nparticular bill, including the coercion of seniors into HMOs and \nincreasing their Medicare premiums with the so-called premium support \nconcept. Within 7 years, many seniors are going to be forced into a \npilot project in at least six locations. In those locations at least, \nand maybe others, we are going to see not only increases in Medicare \npremiums, but also seniors coerced into HMOs. These are cases where \nseniors have never even thought about an HMO until now.\n\n  In addition, millions of seniors are going to go without drug \ncoverage during part of the year. I will talk more about that later.\n  We also are going to keep drug prices high as a result of this \nlegislation. There is very little this legislation does to reduce the \ncost of drugs at all, as I said just a moment ago.\n  And finally, we squander $6 billion needed for retiree coverage on \ntax shelters for the wealthy and the healthy.\n  For all of these reasons--the cost to beneficiaries, the coercion of \nseniors into HMOs, millions of seniors who are going to go part of the \nyear without any coverage at all, the fact that drug prices don't come \ndown but they go up, and that we squander $6 billion on tax shelters \nfor the wealthy in the name of Medicare--it makes a mockery of the \nwhole word ``reform.''\n  I said earlier that up to 25 percent of all beneficiaries will see \nmore costs for drugs. There are two categories in particular. Studies \nhave shown that 2.7 million retirees, including about 5,000 South \nDakotans, will actually lose the coverage they have with the private \nsector when this legislation is enacted. And that 2.7 million number, I \nthink, is actually going to be higher. For those millions of Americans \nand those thousands of South Dakotans, that would be the biggest blow \nof all. They have confidence now that they can go to the pharmacy, and \nthey can buy their drugs. They do not have to worry about whether or \nnot they are covered. They\n\n[[Page S15594]]\n\nhad better start worrying because the problems kick in just as soon as \nthis legislation is enacted, if it is.\n  Up to 6.4 million low-income beneficiaries are going to pay more or \nlose access to drugs they are now provided. I think the 25 percent \nnumber may be a conservative figure.\n  When you take the number of retirees adversely affected, when you \ntake the number of low-income beneficiaries who may be worse off under \nthis plan, you begin to appreciate the magnitude of the problem this \nbill is going to create for millions of senior citizens today who are \ntotally unaware of its negative implications.\n  The legislation creates a dilemma. The choice seniors will face is \nhigher premiums on one side or an HMO on the other. How is that reform? \nHow does that possibly relate to this widely stated goal we all have \nthat we simply want to provide a meaningful drug benefit to senior \ncitizens? This bill isn't a drug reform plan, this is a Trojan horse \nfor the collapse of Medicare.\n  We are going to see the loss of Medicare as we know it today if this \nlegislation passes. I think this chart describes it pretty well.\n  If you want to see increased premiums, support this bill. If you want \nto see seniors forced into an HMO, support this legislation. It leaves \na question mark for a senior citizen right now: What do I do? How do I \nrespond? How can I prepare myself for what is about to come?\n  What is about to come regarding drug coverage is described on this \ncalendar. This calendar says more than any speech probably can. This \ncalendar describes in essence the drug benefit structure. Of all the \nconcerns I have, the benefit structure is one of the most troubling to \nme. I want to describe it, but then I want to use this calendar to talk \nabout its implementation.\n  A senior will start paying $35 a month. We will come back to that \nfigure in just a minute. A senior pays that $35 a month 12 months out \nof the year--January through December. Then the senior must pay 100 \npercent of all the benefits up to the deductible. That is depicted in \nred. Then the first dollar of protection under this plan for drug \ncoverage would kick in, following the $250 deductible. Beneficiaries \npay all of the $250. The drug coverage kicks in from $250 in spending \nup to $2,250. The Government pays 75 percent of the benefit. After the \nbenefit has been paid--75 percent Government, 25 percent senior, up to \n$2,250--the Government says: Wait a minute. We paid all we can pay. You \nare on your own from $2,250 up to $5,100. You are going to pay all the \ncosts during that period.\n\n  After the beneficiary pays $35 a month, 100 percent up to $250, and \n25 percent up to $2,250, they have to pay the entire cost up to $5,100, \neven though they are still paying a premium, and then they have a 95 \npercent benefit that kicks in after that.\n  Basically, what this calendar depicts is the drug schedule for 2006 \nfor beneficiaries with $400 per month in drug spending.\n  By the way, the benefit doesn't kick in until 2006. So there are \npremiums that kick in, and the benefit lasts for a period of time, \nduring the months of February, March, April, and May. They benefit in \nJune somewhat. But for the entire rest of the year they are on their \nown.\n  This convoluted benefit structure is scary, as I think of my own \nmother, and I think of all of those who are going to try to figure it \nout: How in the world do I know how much I owe? How much can I count \non? How much of these benefits are really going to apply to me?\n  This period of no benefits is called a coverage gap. Some people call \nit a donut hole. Whatever you want to call it, it is a mistake.\n  Think of the myriad of administrative costs involved for every single \nsenior citizen who is going to have to try to decide: Are they in the \n25 percent category, the 100 percent category, or are they in the 95 \npercent category?\n  By the way, if you are a senior citizen with a lower income, you are \nentitled to a different schedule. First, they have to know what their \nincome is. They are going to have to turn over their tax records to \ndetermine what kind of income they have and whether they are eligible \nor not. Once those tax records are determined, they then are presented \nwith these different tables that they are going to have to try to \nfigure out. Imagine a 90-year-old woman trying to figure out when she \ngoes to the pharmacy what the coverage gap is: Do I pay the premium? Do \nI have to pay 100 percent? If I do, how do I pay for it? Am I breaking \na law if I expect the pharmacy manager to give me the full benefit? How \ndo I figure this out?\n  This convoluted, confusing, extraordinarily complex schedule is a \ndisaster.\n  I will make a prediction. I will predict that within 12 months, we \nare going to be back fixing this so-called coverage gap. It is chasm, \nit is not a gap. It is a confusion chasm. It is a disaster. That, if \nnothing else, ought to warrant reconsideration of this legislation.\n  But as I say, the coverage gap widens over time. It is not just now. \nThe premium, as I said, starts at $35. In 2013, the premium goes up to \n$58. The deductibles start at $250. But guess what? In 2013, the actual \ndeductible is going to be almost $500. The coverage gap then goes from \n$2,850 in 2006 all the way up to $5,066 by 2013.\n  In other words, senior citizens are going to have to pay $5,000 even \nthough they are paying $35, or in this case $58, a month for the \nbenefit. Can you imagine a senior citizen coughing up these kinds of \ndollars in just a few short years?\n  It is absolutely the most reprehensible expectation for senior \ncitizens. They can no more afford $5,000 in 2013 than they can afford \nit today. It is wrong. This, if nothing else, ought to be a reason we \nshould send this legislation back to the conference to figure out a \nbetter way of doing it.\n  The bottom line is, when it comes to the coverage gap, seniors are \ngoing to have to pay $4,000 to be eligible for $5,000 worth of \nbenefits. Can you imagine that in the name of reform?\n  First of all, we are coercing seniors into an HMO. We are telling \nretirees they may lose their own health benefits. Two to three million \npeople are going to lose benefits, and the benefit they are going have \ninstead is a $5,000 coverage gap and paying $58 a month in 2013. That, \nperhaps more than anything else, is disconcerting. As I talk to \nseniors, the concern they have the most is, of course, the high cost of \ndrugs.\n  First of all, our conferees wasted no time in eliminating the \nreimportation of United States-made drugs from Canada. They will point \nto language in the bill, but the bottom line is we will not see any \nchange in the current law with regard to reimportation of drugs from \nCanada. There is virtually a prohibition on drugs from Canada. South \nDakotans, North Dakotans, Montanans, Minnesotans, Michigan residents \nhave counted on Canadian relief. That has been a big part of what has \nbeen their strategy in coping with the high cost of drugs today. That \nis going to be gone. They will not be able to reimport unless they go \nto Canada themselves.\n  They also have a prohibition--and this is amazing to me as one of the \nthings Medicare has been able to show is it can leverage better prices; \nbecause of the power of pooling, we can leverage, whether it is \nhospital prices, doctor prices, prescription drug prices--and there is \nactually a prohibition for Medicare in the negotiation of lower drug \nprices on behalf of senior citizens. Drug companies can do it, pharmacy \nbenefit managers can do it, but there is a prohibition on the Federal \nGovernment involving itself in negotiating on behalf of senior citizens \nfor lower drug prices today. I have never heard of such a thing. If we \ncannot bring about a better price, if we cannot leverage drug prices \nmore effectively through Medicare, who in the world can do it more \neffectively than the Government itself and Medicare specifically?\n  The reason prices are going to remain high is, No. 1, there is going \nto be very little competition from those sources where competition is \nalready shown to be very effective; No. 2, Medicare itself, the \nGovernment through Medicare, is actually prohibited from negotiating \nbetter prices on behalf of seniors. That is an amazing provision of law \nthat is inexplicable.\n  It goes on. I said earlier one of the concerns I have is this \nprovision that allows $6 billion to be squandered for those who are \nhealthy, and in many cases wealthy today, money that could actually go \nfor retiree coverage. It creates a new health savings account which is \nnothing more, of course, than a tax shelter for those who are wealthy\n\n[[Page S15595]]\n\nand will draw off people who are healthy. Ordinary Americans cannot \nafford it and it undermines the employer-based coverage we already \nhave. Six billion dollars is a tremendous pool of resources that could \nhave gone to making this program far more cost effective and far more \naccessible for a lot of seniors.\n  Instead, even though we did not have it in the Senate bill, even \nthough we had bipartisan support for this $6 billion going to those who \nneed it the most, in keeping with the trend, in keeping with the \nphilosophy of many on the other side, creating this tax shelter for the \nwealthy was a ``must pass'' piece of legislation.\n  The bottom line is we lost $6 billion over the next 10 years that \ncould have gone a long way to reducing the cost of drugs to everyone \nelse.\n  How is it that with all these warts, with all these problems, with \nall these deficiencies, with all these concerns, this legislation could \nbe before the Senate today? This chart shows it pretty well.\n  The Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association had their agenda as \nwell. I must say, they got virtually every single thing they wanted.\n  They wanted an administered drug benefit in the private sector that \ndiluted the purchasing power of Medicare. They got it.\n  They wanted financial incentives for HMOs, another step away from \nMedicare. They got it.\n  They wanted a prohibition on Medicare negotiating prices, as I just \ndescribed a minute ago. Guess what. It is there.\n  They wanted a meaningless reimportation provision because they did \nnot want the competition. Guess what. That is in the bill as well.\n  They wanted a watered-down generic access provision. Check that off \nthe list.\n  They wanted no public scrutiny and secret kickback arrangement \npotential within the contracts they have with the benefit managers and \nthe insurers. That is in there, too.\n  They wanted a huge windfall profit. They are going to make more money \nin the next 10 years than virtually any other sector within our \neconomy. No wonder stock prices are soaring today--because they also \nsee the writing on the wall.\n\n  PhRMA had a checklist. PhRMA got their list checked, every single \nitem on the list.\n  The bottom line is, of course, Medicare beneficiaries lose, PhRMA \nwins, and the bill comes before the Senate with this realization. PhRMA \ngot what it wanted. But organizations that represent seniors, \norganizations that represent working families, organizations that \nrepresent State governments and city governments, organizations of all \nkinds--liberal, conservative, name it--organizations of all kinds have \ncome forward to say: Please do not pass this bill. Send it back to the \ndrawing board. Recognize the damage you are going to do--not just to \nMedicare; recognize the damage you will do to the confidence and the \nsecurity of senior citizens.\n  Now more than 200 organizations have said they oppose this \nlegislation and they want the Senate to oppose it as well.\n  This legislation would have been killed in the House had they abided \nby the rules. One of the most flagrant demonstrations of abuse of the \ninstitution and rules I have seen: They took almost over 3 hours the \nother day to bring about the desired vote on the House floor in spite \nof the opposition of all these organizations.\n  You have all these organizations on one side. This picture depicts \npretty well what is happening on the other. A meeting was called on \nNovember 13 to talk about the benefits of this plan, to convince \nseniors that somehow they are going to be better off. And all these \nempty chairs pretty well depict exactly what happened. Seniors know \nwhat is going on. They were not going to be part of a sham discussion. \nNo one showed up.\n  No one ought to vote for this either. This legislation does not \ndeserve our support. We can do better. This started out as a debate \nabout providing meaningful help to seniors. It has turned into a debate \nto save Medicare.\n  We are going to do all we can to live up to the specific talks, to \nlive up to the needs, the hopes and dreams of senior citizens today. We \nwill do all we can to defeat this bill when those votes are taken.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I listened to the distinguished \nDemocratic leader and find that I agree with much of what he said. This \nmay not be a perfect bill, but clearly there are positive and negative \nfeatures to the bill.\n  I worked a year ago, and through an individual's help, was able to \nrun the numbers with respect to a prescription drug plan and tried to \nmake them come in within $400 billion and found it to be \nextraordinarily difficult. In my view, the most positive feature of \nthis bill is that it delivers voluntary prescription drug coverage to \nthis Nation's Medicare beneficiaries. I find the low-income benefits of \nthis bill to be one of its biggest strengths. It is better than \nanything we ran that came in at $400 billion or below last year.\n  These benefits affect about 1.4 million Californians who have limited \nsavings and low incomes and who will qualify for prescription drug \nbenefits under this bill. Some of these are low-income seniors who do \nnot qualify for Medicaid. Because of $3,000 in savings, they are \nineligible to receive prescription drug coverage through the California \nMedicaid Program. They will now have prescription drug coverage which \nis much better than I had hoped. So 351,000 low-income Californians who \nare not eligible for Medicaid and have no prescription drug benefits \nnow will have them under this bill. This was important to me. It is one \nof the strengths of the bill.\n  Analysis shows that this bill will increase the percentage of \nMedicare beneficiaries with prescription drug coverage from 79 percent \nto approximately 95 percent.\n  To begin with, this bill, as I said, expands the drug coverage to the \n351,000 Californians who are not eligible for Medicaid. The reason it \ndoes that is because it has a much more relaxed assets test. So where \nthe assets tests were so stringent for Medicaid, they are more relaxed \nhere; and, therefore, those 351,000 people who found themselves without \nMedicaid coverage will now have coverage under this bill.\n  Secondly, the bill provides a 16-percent increase in Medicaid \ndisproportionate-share hospital payments in fiscal year 2004. This has \nalways been important to me. Every year we have had to fight for it \nbecause these are the payments that go to our county hospitals. In \nCalifornia, the county hospitals receive most of the people who have no \ncoverage who are bereft and who are extraordinarily low income. \nCalifornia hospitals who qualified to receive Medicaid DSH money lost \n$184 million this year due to cuts enacted in the Balanced Budget Act \nin 1997.\n  This bill restores $600 million to California's hospitals over the \nnext 10 years. I must tell you, with about 25 hospitals that have \nclosed in my State in the last few years, this is a major item for me. \nThe DSH money in this bill will go a long way toward protecting \nCalifornia's fragile health care safety net, which is dependent on a \ncomplex combination of local, State, and Federal funding.\n  Thirdly, the bill improves payments for indirect medical education in \nfiscal year 2004 and beyond. Teaching hospitals will receive a 6-\npercent increase in payments in the second half of fiscal year 2004 and \nwill have their payments spelled out in future years so they can begin \nto plan ahead. Now, they do go down in some years. So there will be \nadvanced knowledge of that so hospitals can begin to plan for that.\n  This is money that reimburses teaching hospitals. My State has some \nof the greatest teaching hospitals in the Nation. This money would \nreimburse those hospitals for costs associated with educating our \nNation's next generation of physicians. That is important to me. I \nthink it is essential funding, and it will allow our major hospitals to \ncontinue training tomorrow's caregivers.\n  Fourthly, the hospitals and physicians in California will benefit \nfrom this bill. Hospitals will see a full market basket update for \nfiscal year 2004 and have the opportunity to receive a full market \nbasket update for the 3 years that follow. With more than 58 percent of \nCalifornia's hospitals losing money treating Medicare beneficiaries,\n\n[[Page S15596]]\n\nand all hospitals facing Federal and State unfunded mandates, the full \nmarket basket update is vital to my hospitals as they struggle to meet \nstaffing, seismic, and privacy compliance requirements.\n  I have heard overwhelming opposition from doctors in my State to the \nprojected 4.5-percent payment cut that physicians and other health care \nproviders would have faced in fiscal year 2004. In other words, without \nthis bill, doctors in my State--and I do not know about elsewhere--but \ndoctors in my State were going to face a projected 4.5-percent payment \ncut.\n  This bill prevents that payment cut from happening, and it includes \nan increase in payments for fiscal years 2004 and 2005 of 1.5 percent \neach year. This means that doctors in my State will be paid more for \ntheir services. It may not sound like a lot, but we have doctors \nleaving California and going to other States because they cannot meet \nthe high cost of living in the State of California and practicing \nmedicine. So even a small amount helps them stay in business.\n  In my State, approximately 33 percent of all Medicare beneficiaries \nget their health care coverage from Medicare+Choice. Now, \nMedicare+Choice has not been a positive experience in every case. I \nthink we all know this. This bill, though, strengthens the \nMedicare+Choice Program, renames it Medicare Advantage, and it provides \npayment increases to HMOs. Some find that objectionable. I, frankly, do \nnot, because these increased payments to HMOs and preferred provider \norganizations should provide some premium stability throughout the \nState. I intend to watch and see if, in fact, it does happen.\n  Now, I have many concerns about this bill. The Democratic leader \npointed out some of them. This is certainly not a perfect bill. I am \nnot on the committee. I did not write the bill. I struggled to have a \nlittle bit of input into the bill, probably much less than I would have \nliked.\n\n  I am deeply concerned about the number of Californians, though, who \nhave lost their retiree health benefits as a result of rising health \ncare costs. This is happening right now without a bill. It is projected \nthat 10 to 12 percent of retirees who have private health care plans \nare losing their benefits each year. That is happening without this \nbill. The reality is--and I know people do not like to look at this--if \nwe do not pass this bill, employers in my State will continue to drop \ncoverage for their retirees at this estimated rate of 10 to 12 percent \na year. Many of these employers who have chosen to retain coverage for \ntheir retirees have required their retirees to pay higher copayments \nand premiums--not under this bill but today.\n  Through direct subsidies and tax provisions, this bill actually \nreduces the number of seniors in California who will lose their retiree \nhealth coverage from approximately 431,420 in the Medicare bill that \npassed the Senate, that a majority of us voted for, to approximately \n198,000 in this bill. These are California numbers, true. I cannot \nspeak to other States. But what I am saying is, because of this bill, \nthe number of retirees in California who would lose their retirement \nbenefits will drop from 431,420 to 198,000.\n  Now, I wish the number were zero, but the point is, the bill makes it \nbetter, not worse. I think that is a good thing.\n  Now, I find it very difficult that this bill does not restore access \nto Medicaid and SCHIP for legal immigrant children and pregnant women \nat the State's option. The Senator from Florida, Mr. Graham, authored \nlegislation which I voted for which did do this. I intend to \nintroduce--and I hope with him--legislation to restore Medicaid and \nSCHIP benefits to California's legal immigrant children and pregnant \nwomen next year.\n  I find it, frankly, troubling that this bill actually provides $250 \nmillion per year for 4 years to reimburse hospitals for providing \nemergency care services for undocumented immigrants, and California's \nhospitals will receive approximately $72 million a year to reimburse \nthem for their care to undocumented immigrants, but we take away the \ncoverage for legal immigrants.\n  I expressed my concern to Senator Breaux, to Senator Baucus, to \nSenator Frist about this issue. I was told the House would not accept \nthis language. I hope next year the Senate will once again pass a bill \nto restore these benefits. This is a big item in California, and I \ndeeply believe people who come to this country legally should be \nentitled to these benefits.\n  My State spent $3.7 billion in 2002 in uncompensated care, so the \nadditional money that California gets for the care of illegal \nimmigrants of $72 million a year at least will go some distance in \ncovering that deficit.\n  In my role as vice chair of the National Dialogue on Cancer and \ncochair of the Senate Cancer Coalition, I have a very serious concern \nabout this bill's Medicare reimbursement cuts for cancer care, \nparticularly oncology physicians. It is my strong view that every \nsuffering cancer patient should be able to have a so-called quarterback \nphysician, an oncologist, someone who is with them who can go through \nall of the terrible choices and decisions that have to be made by a \ncancer patient and stay with them through it all.\n  I have talked to both Senators Baucus and Breaux and also to Senator \nFrist. They have all said this bill will leave the oncology community \nbetter off. I don't see that, candidly. In looking at this complicated \nAverage Sales Price versus Average Wholesale Price issue, I don't see \nwhere they will be better off. I want the Record to reflect that I have \nreceived those assurances. I don't know whether they are true or not, \nbut I can promise my colleagues, I intend to follow very closely the \nimpact this bill will have on cancer care up and down the State of \nCalifornia. My staff and I will be watching the cancer care situation, \nand I am certainly prepared to introduce legislation making technical \ncorrections to Medicare reimbursement for cancer care if the bill has \nthe impact the oncology community predicts it will.\n  It is my understanding that our leadership will appoint an \nindependent commission to be headed by my good friend, former Senator \nConnie Mack. The commission will monitor the impact of this bill on \ncancer care throughout the country and will report and make policy \nrecommendations to Congress.\n  I am also concerned about the impact this bill will have on 50,000 \nlow-income Californians who are living with HIV/AIDS. We have heard a \nlot from the HIV/AIDS community. My concern is with their access to \ndrug treatment therapy under the Medicare prescription drug benefit.\n  What happens in AIDS/HIV treatment is that very often a cocktail of \ndrugs, three or four different drugs, proves to be the most beneficial. \nThe type of drugs varies with the individual, just as any drug would \nwith any of us.\n  I have shared this belief, and the concern is that the formularies \nwould limit an individual to two drugs. I spoke at length with Health \nand Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson Friday night about it and \nasked him to put in writing exactly what would happen. Directly \nfollowing my remarks, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record \nhis Department's response to my concerns.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I will read just a couple of key points made by the \nSecretary in response. Let me quote the Secretary:\n\n       The Secretary may only approve a plan for participation in \n     the Part D program if the Secretary does not find that the \n     design of the plan and its benefits, including any formulary \n     and any tiered formulary structure, will substantially \n     discourage enrollment in the plan by certain classes of \n     eligible Medicare beneficiaries. Thus, if a plan limits drugs \n     for a group of patients (such as AIDS patients), it would not \n     be permitted to participate in Part D.\n\n  I also note that upon completion of this bill, Senators Grassley and \nBaucus and I will enter a colloquy into the Record to emphasize this \npoint.\n  This bill says that if a plan doesn't carry or doesn't treat a drug \nthat is needed by a person with AIDS as a preferred drug, a simple note \nfrom a doctor explaining the medical need for that particular drug \nwould get that drug covered at the preferred price. It cannot take more \nthan 72 hours for seniors to get a drug under this expedited appeals \nprocess. This is my understanding based on conversations\n\n[[Page S15597]]\n\nwith the Secretary. I am delighted this understanding is now in the \nCongressional Record so that we can all follow it.\n  I want to say a word about something that is very controversial in \nthe bill that I happen to support and why I support it. That is income \nrelating the Medicare Part B premium. Let me tell you why I support it. \nI have a great fear that as I watch entitlement spending grow, and I \nhave watched that happen for a decade in the Senate, our children and \nour grandchildren will not have access to Social Security or Medicare. \nLet me tell you why I believe this.\n\n  Since 1993, at my constituent breakfasts we have been using charts to \nillustrate outlays, meaning the money the Federal Government spends \nevery year. I believe they are the truest way to judge Federal \nspending. When I began this, in 1993, entitlement spending was $738 \nmillion. About 50 percent of the outlays in a given year were \nentitlement spending. That was welfare, veterans benefits, Social \nSecurity, Medicare, et cetera. Interest on the debt was 13 percent. So \n63 percent of the outlays in a given year could not be controlled by \nour budget.\n  This year, entitlement spending is $1.174 billion. Entitlements have \nrisen to 54.4 percent, a 4.4 percent increase. Interest has dropped \nsome, to 7.5 percent.\n  Now, if we look at the projection--and this is with the $400 billion \nprescription drug plan--if you look at entitlement spending in 2013, 10 \nyears from now, you see that it is $2.048 billion. So in 10 years it \nhas gone from $738 billion to $2.48 billion. That is the problem. \nEntitlements will be 58 percent of the outlays, and interest on the \ndebt, 11.6 percent. What does that mean? That means 70 percent of \neverything that is spent by the Federal Government in fiscal year 2013 \ncannot be controlled.\n  The other two pieces, of course, are defense, projected at about 16.9 \npercent, and discretionary spending, dropping from 20 percent this year \ndown to 13.6 percent. Discretionary spending is everything else we have \nto do. It is everything in the Justice Department, the Education \nDepartment, the Park Service. All the rest of the Federal Government in \n10 years will be about 13 percent of what is being spent. That is the \nenormity of the entitlement picture.\n  I know it is hard for people to look at this because those people who \nhad the dream of Medicare decades ago looked at it as a program that \neveryone who paid in got out the same benefit. But what the income \nrelating in this bill talks about is just the Part B Medicare premium, \nthe cost of which today is $3,196.80. That is the full cost of the \nMedicare Part B premium in 2004.\n  Now, what is Part B? Part B is physician care, other medical \nservices; it is outpatient hospital care, ambulatory surgical services, \nX-rays, durable medical equipment, physical occupational and speech \ntherapy, clinical diagnostics, lab services, home health care, and \noutpatient mental health service.\n  The premium is $3,196.80. The income-relating provisions in this bill \nare very mild, much milder than what Senator Nickles and I presented on \nthe Senate floor.\n  In this bill, beginning in 2007, individuals with incomes of more \nthan $80,000, or couples with incomes of more than $160,000, will have, \ninstead of 75 percent of their Medicare Part B premium subsidized, 65 \npercent of it will be subsidized by the Federal Government.\n  This goes up four tiers so that individuals with incomes of more than \n$200,000 a year, or a couple with an income of more than $400,000 a \nyear, will have just 20 percent of their Medicare Part B premium \nsubsidized by the Federal Government. Why should hard-working taxpayers \npay for a millionaire's health care? That is my view.\n  I don't see income relating as bringing about the downfall of \nMedicare. I see it as making the program more solvent.\n  There is one significant missed opportunity in this bill that \nconcerns me deeply, and that is the whole area of the cost of \nprescription drugs. I am particularly concerned about the amount of \nmoney spent on prescription drug promotion by pharmaceutical companies. \nPerhaps I have reached the age where I remember when there was no \nadvertising of prescription drugs. We were just as well off then as \nnow, and without huge costs.\n  Let me give you some examples. Promotional spending by pharmaceutical \nmanufacturers has more than doubled, from $9.2 billion in 1996 to $19.1 \nbillion in 2001. That is an annual increase of 16 percent.\n  Most troubling to me is the rapid spending growth of direct-to-\nconsumer advertising of prescription drugs, which has increased an \naverage of 28 percent.\n  Bottom line, Mr. President: I intend to support this bill, and not \nbecause it is perfect, but because I believe it brings substantial help \nto people who need that help in my State of California.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n    Access to Drugs for Aids Patients Under the Bipartisan Agreement\n\n       Question: Will AIDS patients have access to all drugs \n     within a therapeutic class under the Bipartisan Agreement? \n     Can a PDP limit the number of drugs that are covered within a \n     therapeutic class? Are dual eligibles in a Medicare drug \n     plans losing coverage available to them in Medicaid?\n       Answer. In the Bipartisan Agreement there are significant \n     safeguards in the development of plan formularies that will \n     ensure that a wide range of drugs will be available to \n     Medicare beneficiaries.\n       Plans have the option to use formularies but they are not \n     required to do so. If a plan uses a formulary, it must \n     include ``drugs'' in each therapeutic category and class \n     under section 1860D-4(b)(3)(C)(i). A formulary must include \n     at least two drugs in each therapeutic category or class \n     unless the category or class only has one drug.\n       The Secretary will request the U.S. Pharmacopoeia, a \n     nationally recognized clinically based independent \n     organization, to develop, in consultation with other \n     interested parties, a model guideline list of therapeutic \n     categories and classes. How categories and classes are \n     designed is essential in determining which drugs are included \n     on a plan's formulary. USP is clinically based and will be \n     cognizant of the needs of patients. We expect they will \n     design the categories and classes in a way that will meet the \n     needs of patients.\n       In designing formularies, plans must use pharmacy and \n     therapeutic committees that consist of practicing physicians \n     and pharmacists who are independent and free of conflict with \n     respect to the plan, and that have expertise in care of \n     elderly and disabled. The committee has to use scientific \n     evidence and a scientific basis for making its decisions \n     relating to formularies.\n       Further, the Secretary may only approve a plan for \n     participation in the Part D program if the Secretary does not \n     find that the design of the plan and its benefits, including \n     any formulary and any tiered formulary structure, will \n     substantially discourage enrollment in the plan by certain \n     classes of eligible Medicare beneficiaries. If a plan \n     complies with the USP guidelines it will be considered to be \n     in compliance with this requirement. Thus, if a plan limited \n     drugs for a group of patients (such as AIDS patients) it \n     would not be permitted to participate in Part D.\n       Under the Bipartisan Agreement, the beneficiary protections \n     in the Medicare drug benefit are extremely comprehensive to \n     ensure access to a wide range of drugs and are more \n     comprehensive than the protections now required of state \n     Medicaid programs.\n       For example, there are extensive information requirements \n     in Part D so beneficiaries will know what drugs the plan \n     covers before they enroll in the plan.\n       The plans must set up a process to respond to beneficiary \n     questions on a timely basis.\n       Beneficiaries can also appeal to obtain coverage for a drug \n     that is not on their plan's formulary if the prescribing \n     physician determines that the formulary drug is not as \n     effective for the individual or has adverse effects. As a \n     result, there should be access to all drugs in a category or \n     class when needed.\n       Because the Medicare drug benefit will be offered through \n     private plans, plans will have an incentive to offer multiple \n     drugs in a therapeutic class in order to attract Medicare \n     beneficiaries to join their plans.\n       Becuase of the optional nature of the Medicaid drug benefit \n     today, states can drop their coverage entirely. According to \n     a recent Office of the Inspector General report, states have \n     identified prescription drugs as the top Medicaid cost driver \n     (FY 2002, Medicaid prescription drug expenditures totaled \n     approximately $29 billion or 12% of the Medicaid budget). \n     From 1997 to 2001, Medicaid expenditures for prescription \n     drugs grew at more than twice the rate of total Medicaid \n     spending.\n       Pressures on state budgets have led to Medicaid coverage \n     restrictions for drugs and the use of cost control measures \n     that will not be used in the Part D program.\n       Eighteen states contain Medicaid drug costs by limiting the \n     number of prescriptions filled in a specified time period, \n     limiting the maximum daily dosage or limiting the frequency \n     of dispensing a drug. Some states also limit the number of \n     refills.\n       Six states have pharmacy lock-in programs, which require \n     beneficiaries to fill their prescriptions in one designated \n     pharmacy.\n\n[[Page S15598]]\n\n       States already have the authority to limit the number of \n     drugs that may be provided in a therapeutic class, and \n     nineteen states are using preferred drug lists in their \n     Medicaid programs. Thus, dual eligible beneficiaries will \n     have the same access in Part D that they have in Medicaid, \n     with expanded beneficiary protections and appeal rights.\n       Concerns have been expressed that the Medicare benefit will \n     result in a loss of coverage for dual eligibles. This is not \n     the case for low-income beneficiaries, the Bipartisan \n     Agreement provides generous coverage.\n       The Bipartisan Agreement preserves the universality of \n     Medicare for all eligible beneficiaries including those now \n     dually eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid. Unlike \n     Medicaid, the new Medicare Part D benefit will provide a \n     guaranteed benefit to all eligible seniors--a benefit they \n     can count on without fear of loss of benefits when state \n     budgets become tight.\n       Dual eligibles, who currently have full Medicaid benefits, \n     will automatically be given generous subsidies and pay no \n     premium, no deductible and minimal cost-sharing regardless of \n     their actual income (which can be higher than 135% of poverty \n     based on states' special income rules).\n       In addition, full dual eligibles with incomes under 100% of \n     the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) will pay no premiums, no \n     deductible sand only nominal copayments of $1 for generic and \n     other multiple source preferred drugs and $3 for all other \n     drugs. These copayments will increase only at the rate of \n     inflation, the same rate as the Supplemental Security Income \n     (SSI) payments on which many low-income individuals rely.\n       Dual eligible nursing home patients and other \n     institutionalized persons who only have a small personal \n     needs allowances will be exempt from copayments altogether.\n       The copayment levels in the Bipartisan Agreement are \n     similar to what dual eligibles now pay in what is an optional \n     Medicaid benefit in their states. In fact, because of the \n     optional nature of the Medicaid drug benefit today, states \n     can drop their coverage entirely. Current regulations permit \n     states to increase coinsurance to 5%, which is more than what \n     will be permitted for dual eligibles under the new Medicare \n     benefit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, will the Chair please advise me when I \nhave 5 minutes remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will do so.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, during yesterday and early today, we have \nhad characterizations and descriptions of this legislation, which is \nenormously important. We are doing these debates on Saturday and \nSunday, and it is anticipated that we will have a vote tomorrow, \nMonday, on a bill that will not go into effect until 2006, and other \nprovisions will take effect in 2010. I have right here next to me the \nbill, the legislation, which was put on everyone's desk. I am still \nwaiting for a Member to come here and indicate that he or she has read \nit, and describe the details of it.\n  We are dealing with a matter of enormous importance and consequences, \nas we are dealing with issues of life and death for our seniors in this \ncountry--the men and women who have brought this Nation out of the \nGreat Depression, the ones who fought in World War II, the greatest \ngeneration. They came back and faced challenging times. We went from a \n12 million, mostly man military, down to an Army of just a couple of \nmillion, with massive unemployment, and they helped to get the country \nback on a peaceful road. We are talking about a generation that faced \ndown the Soviet Union and communism, and they are now in their golden \nyears.\n  As the great philosophers point out so well, civilization is measured \nby how it treats its elderly people, whether they will be able to live \nin the peace, dignity, and security for their contribution to the \ncountry. I believe in that. I believe in that very deeply.\n  We have to ask ourselves at the end of the day whether this \nlegislation before us, which is being rushed through with effectively 2 \nor 3 days of debate, is worthy of our senior citizens. I mentioned the \nissue of time again because my good friend, the majority leader--and he \nis my good friend--made reference to the fact that I believe that this \nlegislation needed more debate than a Saturday afternoon and evening. I \nwatched the debate going on, and the chairman of the Finance Committee \nand the Senator from Alaska talked up until almost 10 o'clock last \nnight, and now we are here on Sunday afternoon.\n  But I wonder whether it needs more than 2 days debate. I believe it \ndoes; I do believe so. I believe that particularly after we saw what \nhappened in the House of Representatives.\n  This legislation makes an enormous difference to the well-being and \nthe security of seniors in this country. And we saw the facade that \ntook place in the House of Representatives where the vote was called at \n2 or 3 o'clock in the morning, and the vote was kept open beyond the \ntraditional time of 15 to 20 minutes, for nearly 3 hours, in order to \ntry to effectively coerce Members to support the proposal.\n  We are doing that on a measure that is supposed to benefit our senior \ncitizens, and a measure that passed the House of Representatives by \nonly one vote in a purely partisan proposal. Then, it passed the House \nof Representatives by less than a handful the second time, again, on a \npurely partisan proposal. It seems to me that if the House of \nRepresentatives had a full opportunity to have an open discussion and \ndebate, and then have a reasonable vote and call them as they see them, \nthen this process would be worth supporting. We ought to have the same \nhere in the Senate. But, on the one hand, when we have a Republican \nleadership, which is effectively jamming this legislation through the \nHouse of Representatives, and then effectively wants to use the closing \noff of debate and discussion in order to effectively jam it through \nhere, the Senate of the United States, we ought to take a moment or two \nto ask why.\n  I note the references of my friend, the majority leader, about who \nwas really representing the seniors of this country and whether some \nwere delaying this legislation. Many of us have been fighting for a \nprescription drug program for years. I will not take the time today to \ndiscuss the time when it was bottled up in the Republican Finance \nCommittee, and how it only emerged on the Senate floor when we had \nDemocratic leadership here just over a year ago. It is not worth taking \nup the time because I don't have it.\n  But this is a Senator who fought for the Medicare Program, who knows \nthe history of the program, and knows how important the Medicare \nProgram is. I am also mindful--with all respect to those on the other \nside and in the House of Representatives--that they got 12 votes in \nsupport of the Medicare. I know that they are untrustworthy of the \nMedicare Program, that they have a disdain for the Medicare Program. \nThat is a very important difference. They are obviously entitled to \ntheir view.\n  But what we have seen is the efforts that were made on the floor of \nthe Senate earlier this year, where we had a truly bipartisan effort \nfor a prescription drug program. In 1964, Medicare was defeated in the \nSenate. It was defeated by 12 or 14 votes. Seven months later, it \npassed by that number. The only intervening aspect was an election. And \nthe important aspect of that election is that the seniors understood \nwhat the stakes were in that election.\n  I am saying here on the floor of the Senate that the seniors are \ngoing to understand, when they know what is in this bill, how much it \nrisks their future and the future of the Medicare system, make no \nmistake about it.\n  Make no mistake about it, no matter the outcome of this bill in the \nSenate, this issue is going to continue to be debated as we go into \n2004, the 2004 election, 2006, 2008--all the way down the line. This \nissue is not going to go away.\n  I was here when the Senate passed catastrophic coverage. I can \nremember the catastrophic Medicare changes which allegedly were \nsupposed to be so helpful to the seniors. There was a flood of Senators \nwho left this body and rushed down to the television and radio center \nto indicate how they supported it. And I remember how they all crept \nback into this body just a couple of months later to vote to rescind \nthat change because they got it wrong, because they rushed it through \nthe Senate. And that is just what we are in danger of doing with this \nbill.\n  The Medicare system is a tried and tested program. It is a beloved \nprogram. The reason we have a Medicare system is that the private \ninsurance companies failed our elderly people. They continued to fail \nthem. Finally, in the late 1950s, we began to have a debate about a \nMedicare system, and when we had the debate in the 1960 campaign and \n1962 campaigns, we finally found we were able to pass Medicare \nlegislation in 1965. It took 5 years to pass that program, and we want \nto risk that program in a 2-day debate in\n\n[[Page S15599]]\n\nthe Senate when this is a lifeline to so many of our seniors, when we \nare seeing an effort to undermine the Medicare Program. I will get into \nthat in one moment.\n  We had a chance to do something we failed to do in 1965. We passed \nthe Medicare Program that dealt with hospitalization. We passed the \nMedicare Program that dealt with physician fees. But we did not pass a \nMedicare Program that dealt with prescription drugs. Only 3 percent of \nthe private sector programs had prescription drugs at that time. Can \nyou imagine that we would pass a Medicare Program today without \nprescription drug coverage? Those prescription drugs are as important \nas physician services and hospitals today.\n  We are on the verge of the life science century. The breakthroughs we \nare going to see in the next months and years are going to be \nbreathtaking, and our seniors ought to be entitled to those programs. \nThat is why a prescription drug program is so necessary.\n  We passed a good program in a bipartisan way, but that is not the \nproposal that is before the Senate. The bill before us is not that \nproposal. The bill that passed the House of Representatives is not the \nproposal we passed.\n  We have a major undermining of the Medicare system. There are those \nwho say: You are really overstating this, Senator Kennedy. Where in the \nworld are you getting this idea?\n  I understand, as others do, that the position of the President of the \nUnited States earlier in March was that no one who was in Medicare \nwould be entitled to a prescription drug program. I want our seniors to \nlisten to that. In the spring of this year, this President indicated he \nsupported the program for prescription drugs only when it was delivered \nby the HMOs.\n  He gave up that position. He said: Oh, no, let's try and see if we \ncan figure out something else that may be related to the Medicare \nsystem. That was his position. That is the position of the majority of \nthe people who are supporting this program. Make no mistake about it, \nthat is their position. They believe that is what ought to happen: that \nwe ought to dismantle the Medicare system, undermine it, privatize it. \nThat is what they want to do.\n  You say: Why in the world are you saying that? How can you possibly \nsay that? Read the paper this past week. The Washington Post, Friday, \nNovember 21:\n\n       Bid to Change Social Security is Back.\n\n  They are going to get Medicare first. Social Security is next. Here \nit is:\n\n       President Bush's aide reviving long shelved plan on Social \n     Security. A Presidential adviser said [Bush] is intent on \n     being able to say that reworking Social Security ``is part \n     of my mandate.''\n\n  There it is, my friends, Social Security is next; Medicare now. That \nis why I think we ought to have some debate because, I daresay, I don't \nbelieve the Members of this body understand what is going to be done \nwith the proposals.\n  There are three major provisions in this proposal that will \neffectively undermine the Medicare system. The first is the premium \nsupport proposal. I have listened day after day, week after week, month \nafter month: We have to give premium support a try. My answer is: Why? \nWhy? We know what it means even before trying it. Committed as they are \non the other side of the aisle to start off with hundreds of thousands \nor a few million and multiply that to millions and millions of people, \nwe understand what the results are going to be before we even try the \nprogram. They said: Let's try it; let's understand what the outcome is \ngoing to be.\n  Currently, everyone in the United States pays into the Medicare \nsystem. No matter where you live, you get your range of benefits. You \nget to pay the same premium and you get the same range of benefits all \nover this country. It is uniform. Not under premium support. You are \ngoing to pay in and you are going to pay more. Even the administration \nhas recognized that the minimum you are going to pay is 25 percent \nmore. You are going to pay more. So that every elderly person who \nunderstands premium support, this administration understands you are \ngoing to pay more at the outset.\n  Secondly, you are never going to know what your premium is because it \nis going to depend on where you live. These are not my figures, these \nare the figures of the Medicare actuary. Here it is: Under the premium \nsupport program--this is the Medicare actuary--the national average \nunder current law will be $1,205 by 2013. It is about $700 now. Their \nestimate is $1,205. A year and a half ago they estimated the premium \nsupport would be $1,771. The Medicare actuary estimated that every \nsenior citizen would be paying $500 more in premiums than they would be \npaying under Medicare.\n  This year they have gone down to $1,501. They have gone down \nnationwide as starters, and we have to learn something more. That is \nnot good enough.\n  The difference with premium support is there is no security. It \ndepends on where you live. Do you understand that? Your premiums are \ngoing to be based not on the national standard that we have at the \npresent time but on where you live.\n  In my State of Massachusetts, under premium support, it will be \n$1,450 in Barnstable, MA, and $1,050 in Hamden, MA; $400 more. The \ndifference is 100 miles. In Dade County, FL, it is $2,000 and, in \nOsceola, FL, it is $1,000; $1,000 more.\n  Explain that to some senior who lived there all their life, has a \nhouse and is proud to live there, and they find that their premiums are \ngoing to be $2,000 and their neighbors in another part of Florida are \npaying $1,000.\n  It is very interesting what my friends on the other side say: Senator \nKennedy, you don't understand what we are going to do in this bill. We \nare only going to let it go up 5 percent a year this year. That is what \nthey say this year. Next year in the Budget Committee, or the year \nafter, it won't be 5 percent. We will have to recalculate. It will be \n10 percent or 15 percent, or let's have a free enterprise system and \nlet it sail off. That is what is going to happen.\n  That is what has happened in the Metropolitan Statistical Areas \n(MSAs), and the list goes on: $1,700 in Los Angeles, $775 in Yolo, CA. \nMedicare actuaries--every senior citizen ought to understand that \npremium support is written in this legislation. One can say, well, it \nis written in such a way that we are not going to face it for several \nyears. Several years? But it is still there. The only way to repeal it \nis to come back here to the Congress.\n  In Yamhill, OR, premiums would be $1,325, but only $675 in Columbia, \nOR. It is double the amount if one lives in a different part of the \nState.\n  Why do we have to experiment with premium support? We already know \nwhat the results are going to be. That is a key element in this \nlegislation. It was not in the Senate bill. I did not hear our majority \nleader make much of a case for it. To be honest about it, I do not hear \nthe President of the United States make much of a case for it.\n  Nonetheless, when one is talking about the House of Representatives, \nthey understood what this was all about. They committed to it, alright.\n  Now one might say: Well, Senator, what about the health delivery \nsystem? We are going to have the health delivery system delivered \nthrough the HMOs. Let us have real competition.\n  How many times have I heard this from our Republican friends over \nthere: Let us have competition? We are glad to have competition, but do \nnot suggest that this bill is competition. It is not. I see the \nchairman of the Finance Committee. He can correct me if I am wrong \nabout any of these figures.\n  We start off with every HMO getting a 109 percent increase in the \ncost of living over Medicare. Is that competition? Competition? Come \non. Beyond that, CMS--the governmental agency that administers the \nMedicare program--pays an additional 16 percent in excess of Medicare's \nown costs to private insurance companies because seniors who join \nMedicare HMOs are healthier than seniors in the traditional Medicare \nsystem.\n  So, under this bill, Medicare is going to pay a 25 percent advantage \nor bonus for every senior citizen that goes into an HMO. Our Republican \nfriends are talking about competition, the free enterprise system. Is \nthere a business man or woman in this country who would not want a deal \nsuch as this? The tragic part is, who is paying for it? It is our \nseniors who are paying for it.\n  And you think Medicare is going to be able to hold on when they are \neffectively getting a $1,936 overpayment per senior? That is what they \nare getting now. This is not competition with\n\n[[Page S15600]]\n\nMedicare. This is a rip-off. This is a scandal. This is a payout. And \nthat is what is happening now under our overpayment to the HMOs.\n  As a matter of fact, you are overpaying them almost the amount that \nthe average person does for the prescription drugs. You could almost \nmake a deal and say, do not even bother with the prescription drug \nprogram. The HMOs are almost paying the whole amount. That is what the \nseniors pay, $2,300. We are paying close to a $2,000 overpayment.\n  On the one hand, you have the premium support that is going to \nundermine it. Secondly, you have this program on the overpayment of the \nHMOs. Given the dramatic overpayment on this, we can see what is going \nto happen with the HMOs.\n  Look at what is going to happen with the HMOs, according to the \nactuaries. This year, there is $31 billion that went through the HMOs \nin this country. The best estimate, given the arrangement that has been \nmade now, will be $181 billion going through the HMOs. You call this \nprivate competition? Competition with Medicare? This is outrageous. Do \nmy colleagues think we are having that debate here on the floor of the \nSenate? Do my colleagues think we have time to change that 109 percent \ndown to 102 percent or 104 percent? Absolutely not. We do not have time \nto do that.\n  Do my colleagues think we have time to change this with regard to the \n16 percent advantage? Do my colleagues think we have any time to do \nthat? Oh, no, let's stamp it. Let's close the books. Let's say to those \nwho would like to have that kind of debate and offer amendments, this \nis being delayed for our senior citizens.\n\n  This is absolutely outrageous. We know what is going on. These are \nthe payoffs to the HMOs.\n  Beyond that, if that is not enough, listen to this: Not only do they \nhave the additional 25 percent, which is almost $2,000, there is also a \n$12 billion slush fund. What did the Senator from Massachusetts say? A \n$12 billion slush fund.\n  Well, what can they do with the $12 billion? They can give it to the \nHMOs as well. This is running-around money, walking-around money, $12 \nbillion more. Who pays for that? The seniors pay for that under the \nMedicare system.\n  Do we have an opportunity to offer an amendment to strike that? Oh, \nno. Do my colleagues think we have an opportunity to go back to the \nSenate position that said let's take half of that and use it for good \npreventive kinds of medicine for our seniors, such case management \nprograms? No, no. That was what we passed in the Senate. Do my \ncolleagues think we can go back? No, no. We have to rush this proposal \nin.\n  In the meantime, we are telling our seniors all across this country \nthat $12 billion is needed to help the HMOs. Tell that to the 10 \nmillion seniors who need Celebrex to deal with arthritis, or the 12 \nmillion to deal with osteoporosis, or the 11 million with treatments \nfor diabetes, high cholesterol, thyroid deficiency, and depression. \nThese are millions of our fellow citizens who could benefit from that \n$12 billion. Oh, no. We have to give that as a supplement to the HMOs.\n  I have listened to those who say: Well, at least our senior citizens \nare going to be better off. Let us just look what is going to happen to \nour senior citizens. We have the 2 to 3 million retirees who are going \nto be dropped. They are certainly not going to be better off. There are \n6 million people worse off. Who are these 6 million? These are the \nMedicaid beneficiaries who, the day this bill goes into effect, are \ngoing to be worse off. These are the people who are paying the $1 to $3 \ncopays. The States are paying for it with the Medicaid. Know what? They \nwill not be paying anymore. Why? Because this bill prohibits it.\n  So one might ask whether they are better off. We start right off with \n9 million beneficiaries who are going to be worse off. People say: \nWell, Senator, what about all of those low-income people we are all \nconcerned about in this program? I am going to come back to that.\n  Let's take these 6 million people, who are the poorest of the poor, \nwho are going to be worse off. Is that really going to make much \ndifference, because it is only a couple of bucks a week, $3 to $5 a \nweek, maybe $20, $25 a month? But when one is talking about the average \nincome for seniors at about $12,000, it adds up. There are studies to \nshow what happens to the poor when they do not pay the copays in terms \nof adverse health outcomes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. ALLARD). The Senator from Massachusetts \nhas 5 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Chair tell me when I have 1 minute remaining, \nplease.\n  This is what happens to those poorest of the poor when they do not \nhave the copays--serious adverse events effectively double. The \nemergency rooms effectively double. These findings are demonstrated by \nresearch studies published in JAMA.\n  Of course, the sad fact is it ends up costing hundreds of millions \nand billions of dollars more to pay for in these circumstances. It is \nbad health policy and it is bad economics.\n\n  Finally, we had a good program that passed the Senate. We found our \nfriends in the conference knocked out 3 million of the neediest elderly \npeople in this country. We provided for up to 160 percent of poverty, \nthey made it up to 150 percent of poverty. That is a million people. \nAnd they reimposed the asset test for those under 150 percent of \npoverty. As a result of reimposing it, that is a total of 2.8 million \nwho were included for help and assistance under the Senate bill who \nwere wiped out in this conference report. We had a good bill, but that \nis not the one that is before us.\n  Finally, the third part of the inclusions in this legislation, what \nthey used to call Medical Savings Account, now referred to as Health \nSavings Accounts (HSAs), which have very high deductibles and low \npremiums. Who takes advantage of those programs? The most healthy \npeople take advantage of those and the most wealthy people take \nadvantage of those.\n  What is the problem with that? The problem with that is that if you \nare the working poor, working middle class, if you have some children, \nyou can't afford to constantly pay the deductibles. So what happens to \nyour premiums? Two studies--one study by the American Academy of \nActuaries ``Medical Savings Accounts: Cost Implications and Design \nIssues,'' May 1995, and another by the Urban Institute, ``Tax-Preferred \nMedical Savings Accounts and Catastrophic Health Insurance Plans: A \nNumerical Analysis of Winners and Losers,'' April 1996)--indicate that \npremiums will rise at least 60 percent. That is not just talking about \nthe elderly people, that is across the country. That is undermining the \nemployer-based system.\n  We have enough problems in this country with the uninsured. Now we \nhave an additional proposal that is going to raise the cost of premiums \nfor working families in this country? That has been included. Was that \nin the Senate bill? Absolutely not. But it has been in the House. It \nhas been a matter of faith in the House. There you have it: Premium \nsupport, not a level playing field, a new form of health insurance that \nis going to raise the premiums for workers. What in the world does that \nhave to do with the prescription drug program? It has a lot to do with \nideology. That is what this bill is about, to undermine, to privatize \nMedicare. After they do that, coming right behind it is the Social \nSecurity Program, make no mistake about it.\n  We can do better. We should do better. We ought to take the time to \ndo better. There are enough Republicans and Democrats alike in this \nbody who have demonstrated over the period of the last year and a half \nthat we can get a good bill. There is no reason to be stampeded with a \nbad bill. Why are we being stampeded with a bad bill? We ought to take \nour time, get a good bill, make a difference for our seniors, make a \ndifference for our country. That is what I believe.\n  I hope we will have the opportunity to take the time so all of our \nMembers understand it, and not just these Members but so our seniors, \nwhose lives are going to be affected, who are suffering every single \nday and making choices between putting food on the table and paying for \ntheir prescription drugs, so they understand it. Don't we have enough \nrespect for our seniors so we can provide some opportunity for those \nindividuals to understand it? Or are we\n\n[[Page S15601]]\n\ngoing to be rushed into the situation with short debates on Saturday \nand Sunday and then have the gauntlet come down. We saw what happened \nover in the House of Representatives. It took them 3 hours in order to \ngalvanize this. I think we should demonstrate in this institution too \nmuch respect for our seniors to be stampeded into a bad bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. The \nSenator from Kentucky is recognized for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. If I could offer a unanimous consent request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Kentucky yield for a \nunanimous consent request?\n  Mr. BUNNING. I have a unanimous consent request first to propose. \nThen I will.\n  Mr. REID. That is fine.\n  Mr. BUNNING. I ask unanimous consent that with the previous order \nstanding in place, the 30-minute time limit on each Senator be \nconsidered controlled time, so that any remaining time may be yielded \nto another Senator, and if not yielded, the time be automatically \nyielded back.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. In layman's terms, what this means is, if there are \nSenators on our side or the other side who want to use the 30 minutes \nin any way they want--10-10-10, 15-15--that is certainly permissible. \nThe going back and forth would be unfair otherwise because someone here \nwould use 30 minutes and only 10 there.\n  So what we are going to do--I think this is totally appropriate. I \nask the distinguished Senator from Kentucky to allow a modification, \nsimply a housekeeping matter over here. The Senator from Michigan, Mr. \nLevin, and the Senator from Florida, Mr. Nelson, are going to switch \nplaces, and also that Senator Edwards would be listed at the end of our \nlist as the final Democratic speaker.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BUNNING. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Kentucky is recognized for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, today I rise to talk about the Medicare \nprescription drug bill. First, let me commend the members of the \nconference committee who worked day and night for many months to reach \nthis agreement. I know it was not easy, but they have done a good job \nthat will finally bring Medicare into the 21st century.\n  Second, let me say how disappointed I am that it appears some Members \nmay try to filibuster this bill. In fact, it seems as though there are \nMembers in this body who want to filibuster just about everything we \ntry to do, whether it is stopping judicial nominations, the Energy \nbill, or this Medicare bill. Just a few weeks ago we spent several days \nin continuous debate on judicial nominations. On Friday, the Energy \nbill was blocked. Now it looks as though some are going to try to kill \nthis bill. I call that obstructionism.\n  I want to show a chart because from the beginning there have been \ncharts shown on both sides. These are 358 different groups--358 \ndifferent groups that support this bill in its present form. It is \nheaded by the American Association of Retired People--the AARP, which \nrepresents over 35 million seniors.\n  Seniors have been pleading for Congress to expand Medicare to include \ndrug coverage, and this bill will do just that. It might not be all \nthings to all people, and I am sure every Member in here would have \nwritten a different bill if it was completely up to him or her, but \nthat is not the way we work around here and this bill is a very large \ncompromise. Even the AARP, as I said before, has endorsed this bill and \nsaid that, although the bill is imperfect, it is an historic \nbreakthrough. I want to repeat that--an historic breakthrough; and that \nwe should not let this opportunity pass us by.\n  Today, Medicare provides health insurance to about 40 million seniors \nand disabled individuals each year. The number is only expected to grow \nas the baby boomers begin retiring. Medicare provides important medical \nand health and hospital benefits for seniors. However, it is a program \nthat is still trying to provide health care as if it were in 1965 \ninstead of the year 2003.\n  When Medicare was created, prescription drugs played a small role, a \nvery small role in medical care. Today, as we all know, that is much \ndifferent. In fact, for many seniors and many Americans, prescription \ndrugs have replaced expensive surgeries and extended their lives \nsignificantly. By tying a drug benefit to Medicare, this bill makes \nthese lifesaving and life-enhancing drugs more available to millions of \nAmericans.\n  This has been a very long process, and I kind of chuckle when I hear \npeople say we are rushing into this. I can tell you as a member of the \nFinance Committee that we have been working on this bill for almost the \nentire year, working and crafting legislation to make the best drug \nbill possible for all Americans.\n  I was supportive of our bill as it moved through the Finance \nCommittee and through the full Senate. Today I am supportive of the \nbill before us. It is time to add this benefit to Medicare. Seniors \nhave waited too long for their benefit, and I urge my fellow colleagues \nin the Senate to support this bill. Talk is cheap, and it is time to \nact and it is time to act now.\n  We have $400 billion allocated for this benefit. It would be a shame \nif we let this opportunity pass us by. It might not come again.\n  This legislation provides a much needed prescription drug benefit to \nMedicare beneficiaries. It provides more options to seniors than just \ntraditional fee-for-service Medicare, and it provides incentives to \ncompanies to continue offering medical benefits to their retirees.\n  Seniors will be able to receive prescription drug coverage under two \noptions: Through the traditional fee-for-service Medicare and also \nthrough a new Medicare Advantage Program made up of private companies \noffering Medicare benefits.\n  Under the fee-for-service Medicare, beneficiaries will be able to \nenroll in Medicare drug plans. The standard drug benefit will require a \n$35 monthly premium and a $250-a-year deductible. Once seniors have met \nthe deductible, they will pay 25 percent of the prescription drug cost \nup to $2,250. Once a beneficiary has received an out-of-pocket spending \nlimit of $3,600, they will pay 5 percent for their prescription drugs.\n  I emphasize this because this is the key to the whole Medicare \nprescription drug benefit.\n  Low-income seniors will be provided with assistance paying for their \ndrug costs depending on the level of their income. This means that \nseniors with the lowest income--those below 100 percent of poverty--\nwill not pay a deductible or monthly premium and will pay either $1 or \n$3 per prescription drug up to the catastrophic limit. Once they reach \nthe catastrophic limit, these seniors will have 100 percent of their \ndrugs paid for.\n  These are the seniors who truly struggle to pay for their \nprescriptions. At 100 percent of poverty, a senior's income is $8,900 \nper year. Other low-income seniors below 150 percent of poverty will \nreceive additional assistance depending upon their level of income. \nPersonally, I believe our biggest responsibility is to low-income \nseniors. These are the ones who struggle the most to buy their \nprescriptions, and they deserve a very generous benefit.\n  Seniors will also be able to choose to receive their health care \nthrough a private company. I hope everybody heard that. They will be \nable to choose. This is a voluntary program. You can choose to stay in \nMedicare Part B and have no prescription drugs if you choose to do \nthat. You can choose to take Medicare Part B and add a prescription \ndrug benefit or you can choose to go into a private company's health \ncare program.\n  Under Medicare Advantage, seniors will be able to choose whether they \nwould like medical coverage from a preferred provider organization, \nknown as a PPO, or a health maintenance organization, or HMO, operating \nin their regions.\n\n  These plans will provide beneficiaries with an integrated benefit, \nwhich means seniors will receive both medical and drug coverage under \nthe plan. They would have a single deductible for medical benefits \ncurrently provided under Medicare Part A and B. They would also be able \nto receive preventive care, disease management, and chronic care under \nthese programs.\n  These private plans will have much more flexibility in the type and \nscope\n\n[[Page S15602]]\n\nof benefits they provide than traditional Medicare, and will provide \nmany seniors with a valuable health care option.\n  Please notice--``option, voluntary.'' These are very key to this \nwhole program.\n  I know some of my colleagues do not like these PPOs and HMOs because \nthey say seniors will not be able to go to any doctor they choose. \nHogwash. No one is going to force the seniors into these private plans, \nand they will be able to pick a plan in which their doctor \nparticipates.\n  Please understand that. We are not going to force any senior away \nfrom their given doctor. They will be able to choose their own doctor \nand stay with that doctor.\n  That is one of the key elements of the bill--giving seniors more \nchoices instead of forcing them to use a health care plan created in \n1965, which has changed very little since then. If these care advantage \nplans sound familiar, they should.\n  Finally, Medicare will provide seniors with a modern benefit similar \nto what is offered to most employees, including what the Federal \nGovernment offers to employees.\n  One of the biggest concerns with the legislation as it moved through \nthe Finance Committee and the full Senate was what would happen to \nretirees who currently have drug coverage from their former employer. \nNo one wants this new program to be an excuse for employers to drop \ntheir retirees' health coverage. That would be counterproductive and \nunfair to those seniors. To encourage companies to continue providing \nthese benefits, this agreement sets aside almost $70 billion of our \n$400 billion for subsidies to help companies cover their prescription \ndrug costs for their medical-eligible retirees. This is a substantial \ncommitment by Congress to make sure companies do not have an excuse to \ndrop their coverage.\n  The members of the conference committee have worked long and hard for \nmany hours and in many meetings over the last year on this compromise. \nWe have a real chance to pass this bill, and we shouldn't pass up this \nopportunity.\n  If we don't pass this bill now, it will be several years before we \nget another chance, and seniors have waited much too long already.\n  Again, I urge my fellow Senators to pass this bill and finally \nfulfill the promise that each and every one of us in the Senate has \nmade either on the campaign trail or anywhere that we have spoken to \nsenior groups. We have promised this benefit and we can deliver it.\n\n  I urge my fellow Senators, once again, to pass this bill providing \nprescription drug coverage to our seniors. We can talk about it for 2 \nor 4 more years or we can do it now.\n  I yield whatever time I have to the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). There are 14 minutes 50 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we have heard in the Senate today and \nlast night that the comparative cost adjustment demonstration project, \nwhich some of the Members refer to as premium support, would end \nMedicare as we know it. I want to be very clear, nothing could be \nfurther from the truth. I have 10 facts about this demonstration to \nexplain why this is not the case. We are talking about the comparative \ncost adjustment.\n  Fact No. 1: It sunsets in 6 years. The demonstration will only be in \nexistence for 6 years. It will not begin until the year 2010. During \nthat time, there will be a 4-year phase-in period. Explicit \nauthorization from Congress at the end of 6 years is necessary to \nextend the demonstration and/or expand it to other areas of the \ncountry. This proposal is significantly modified from the House of \nRepresentatives' original position. Congress weighs in before this \nbecomes something other than a demonstration project and becomes policy \nfor the entire country.\n  Fact No. 2: Very limited areas of the country will be affected in the \ndemonstration. Under the agreement, the Health and Human Services \nSecretary may select no more than six metropolitan statistical areas to \nparticipate in the demonstration. It is not easy to be put in that list \nof six because in order to be selected, a metropolitan statistical area \nmust have at least two local coordinated care plans offering services \nin the area and at least 25 percent of the Medicare beneficiaries must \nbe enrolled in these plans. That means the private PPOs we are setting \nup beginning in 2006 must succeed. I hope they succeed. But we do not \nknow if they will succeed, and if they do not succeed, at least to the \ntune of 25 percent in two local areas, there will not be one. If that \ndoes happen, according to the Congressional Budget Office, somewhere \nbetween 670,000 and 1 million beneficiaries will be included in this \nlimited demonstration. It is a demonstration. It is not something that \ncould ever, without an act of Congress, encompass all 40 million \nseniors.\n  Fact No. 3: Low-income beneficiaries are not affected at all. So if \nthey are low-income, below 150 percent of poverty, none of them will \nsee their Part B premiums increase.\n  Fact No. 4: Premium increases for beneficiaries above 150 percent of \npoverty will be limited to 5 percent. For everyone else, if premiums go \nup, there is a cap of 5 percent. As an example, if the national Part B \npremium was, say, $100 in 2010, the fee-for-service premiums in the \ndemonstration areas could not exceed $105 a month. The increase, by the \nway, is not compounded over that 6-year period of time.\n  Fact No. 5: Other than the limited impact on the Part B premium \ncalculation, the fee-for-service program is unchanged choice. Fee-for-\nservice benefits, beneficiary cost sharings, payments to hospitals, and \nother health care providers are unaffected by the demonstration. The \nMedicare entitlement to benefits and payments to health care providers \nare unchanged in these same areas.\n\n  Fact No. 6: Beneficiaries are not required to enroll in these private \nplans. The right for a Medicare beneficiary to remain in fee-for-\nservice programs is maintained in the demonstration areas. The fee-for-\nservice program will remain affordable for all beneficiaries.\n  Fact No. 7: The prescription drug benefit is unaffected. The \nprescription drug benefit and the drug premiums are not changed. The \ndemonstration only minimally affects the Part B premium, and that is \nthe maximum of 5 percent increase.\n  Fact No. 8: Over the demonstration period, enhanced payments to \nprivate plans are phased out to ensure that their payments to private \nplans are on a level playing field with the fee-for-service program.\n  Fact No. 9: The preferred provider organization stabilization fund, \nreferred to on the other side by my colleague as a ``slush fund,'' has \nno relationship to this demonstration. So one cannot talk about the \ndemonstration and talk about a stabilization fund in the same breath. \nIf you do that, you do not know what the bill does; you have not read \nthe bill.\n  Under the conference agreement, the stabilization fund may only be \nused to provide assistance to the newly regional PPO options. However, \nany enrollment in regional PPOs is not counted toward the 25 percent \nenrollment requirement in the metropolitan statistical areas. The \nextent to which beneficiaries enroll in the new regional PPO opposite \nwill have no bearing on whether a metropolitan statistical area becomes \na candidate for demonstration.\n  Last fact, No. 10: Strict quality monitoring is required. The Health \nand Human Services Secretary is required to closely monitor access to \ncare and quality and submit a report to Congress upon completion of the \ndemonstration to determine if the demonstration has reduced Medicare \nspending and/or increased cost to beneficiaries; second, access to \nphysicians and other health care providers has declined; and lastly, \nwhether beneficiaries remain satisfied with the program. The evaluation \nwould be on the basis of any congressional decision to extend that \ndemonstration.\n  Premium support, as has been described in the Senate numerous times \nin the last few days by the Senator from Massachusetts and by other \nSenators, is not in this bill. It is not included. This bill \nstrengthens and improves fee-for-service Medicare.\n  How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seven minutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. It would be good at the start of the third day of \ndebate on\n\n[[Page S15603]]\n\nthis bill to remind people of the political situation that has gotten \nus where we are today. That is a very positive political situation.\n  Last year, we were beginning to develop a bill in the Senate Finance \nCommittee that would have had bipartisan support to get it out of the \ncommittee. Bipartisan support in the committee is a way to have a \nchance of success in the Senate where there can always be an \nextraordinary minority who can keep a bill from being passed because we \nprotect minority interests in this body as no place else in our \npolitical system. So we must be bipartisan.\n  About the time that was going to happen, the majority leader--the \nSenator from South Dakota, last year--decided we needed to talk about \nthis in the Senate. But the bill never came out of committee. It was \nbrought right to the floor. When bills are brought to the floor, there \nis no chance of developing bipartisanship. We discussed it for 2 or 3 \nweeks and no one could get the bipartisan majority it takes to get \npieces of legislation passed.\n  At that time, I surmised, and I think the outcome of the debate last \nyear proves it, that the other side wanted more of an issue for the \nelection rather than a product. They gambled and they lost because \nRepublicans gained control of the Senate in that election and then we \nwere right back to square 1 where we went to the Senate Finance \nCommittee where there could be, even with a Republican majority, still \na bipartisan working relationship that was able to report out a bill on \n16-to-5 bipartisan vote. Then we brought that bill to the floor during \nthe month of June. And it got through here 76 to 21.\n\n  We are as successful as we are because the people made a change in \nthe Senate.\n  In the Senate, then, we adopted a bipartisan bill, and we were able \nto get through, for the first time on this issue in the history of the \nSenate, prescription drugs for seniors. We were able to match the \nHouse, where it had passed three times previously. We went to \nconference. We operated in the conference, at least from the Senate \npoint of view, on a bipartisan basis, and we were able to produce a \nproduct where here we are doing the best improvement and the most \nsweeping improvement in Medicare in 38 years. We are able to do that \nbecause of bipartisanship.\n  Now, all of a sudden, people on the other side of the aisle, at this \nlast minute, are filibustering. I hope they do not get away with that \nfilibuster. But, again, they are trying to be very partisan, as they \nwere a year ago. I hope they learned a lesson from a year ago and will \nnot try to be partisan on this very important social issue for the \nseniors and the disabled of America, and that they will not repeat the \nmistakes of last year when they wanted an issue instead of a product.\n  We have a bipartisan product. I listed last night, in my closing \nremarks, all of the organizations that are supporting this bill. Other \nSenators have put charts up saying how many organizations are \nsupporting this bill.\n  We have this opportunity. Let's hope partisanship--that is \ndemonstrated by the filibuster that was announced yesterday--does not \nkeep this bill from passing. Democrats who want to filibuster ought to \nconsider that is not the way to go. They should learn from the lesson \nof the past. That lesson is that last year when they wanted an issue \ninstead of a product, they got a defeat at the polls.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Madam President, since its creation in 1965, \nthe Medicare Program has helped millions of our Nation's elderly and \ndisabled when they desperately needed it, after they became ill.\n  It has been an extremely successful and popular program, and has \nimproved the health of countless seniors.\n  Now that we are in the 21st century, it is time to reap the full \nbenefits of the advances made over the years, and shift the focus of \nthe Medicare Program from assistance after illness to one that promotes \nwellness.\n  To achieve that, a prescription drug benefit is mandatory. Ninety \npercent of seniors have at least one chronic condition; drugs are often \nthe best way to manage those conditions.\n  The bill we are considering is frequently divided into two parts--one \npart is the prescription drug benefit, and the other part is Medicare \nreform.\n  Let me state what we all ought to know by now: A prescription drug \nbenefit is the most fundamental reform that we can make to the Medicare \nProgram.\n  If we want to truly reform Medicare, we must change the approach of \nthe program from one of sickness to one focused on wellness. This \nprevention approach will require access to prescription drugs.\n  Modern medicine has been altered fundamentally by prescription drugs, \nnotably by improving the quality of people's lives, ending the need for \nsurgeries and long recovery periods.\n  A side benefit of this change would be that the cost to the Medicare \nProgram could be lower by reducing these procedures.\n  I have introduced several prescription drug bills over the past few \nyears because I believe a reorientation toward wellness is in the best \ninterest of our seniors, as well as the Medicare Program.\n  However--and this is critical--not just any prescription drug bill \nwill do. The bills I have authored have been constructed to provide an \naffordable, comprehensive, reliable prescription drug benefit to our \nseniors and Medicare beneficiaries with disabilities.\n  The bill I introduced in 2001, cosponsored by Senators Zell Miller \nand Edward Kennedy, was voted on in July of that year. It received 52 \nvotes.\n  That bill would have made a significant, and positive, difference in \nthe lives of the nearly 41 million older Americans and disabled \ncitizens who are covered by Medicare--more than 2,770,000 of whom live \nin Florida.\n  The conference agreement that we are now considering would also make \na significant difference in the lives of our seniors. However, that \ndifference will not be a positive one.\n  I have many grave concerns about this legislation. The drug portion \nof the bill is deeply flawed. It includes an enormous coverage gap. \nWhen a senior has reached $2,250 in total drug expenses, all drug \ncoverage stops. The drug benefit doesn't begin again until total drug \nspending reaches $5,100. That is a gap of $2,850.\n  And during all of the months the senior is in that ``gap'', the \nsenior is required to keep paying premiums.\n  The bill is projected to cause 2.6 million retirees nationwide, and \nover 160,000 in Florida, to lost their retiree prescription drug \ncoverage.\n  It will cause 6 million low-income seniors nationwide, and over \n360,000 in Florida, to pay more for their drugs, and to face more \nrestrictions on the drugs they can get.\n  It relies on an untested delivery system which would either herd \nseniors into what we know they don't like, a managed care organization, \nor would turn them into guinea pigs for a never previously utilized \ndrug-only insurance plan.\n  Millions and millions of seniors who will not have access to drugs \nthrough the traditional Medicare Program will suffer the fate I have \njust described.\n  In addition, the legislation that was supposed to be about adding a \nprescription drug benefit now includes provisions that will privatize \nthe Medicare Program beginning in the first year of implementation \nfragmenting the health insurance group by subsidizing health savings \nand increase the costs of comprehensive health insurance for our non-\nMedicare citizens.\n  I am not alone in my concern about this legislation. In a recent \nsurvey conducted by Hart Research, of voters aged 55 and older, only 19 \npercent said we should pass this bill. Sixty-four percent said we \nshould go back to the drawing board. This isn't the Medicare \nprescription drug benefit that they need.\n  And although the AARP has taken the inexplicable position of \nsupporting this legislation, the national organization may want to \nlisten to its members. Only 18 percent of AARP members want Congress to \npass the bill. Sixty-five percent have instructed us to go back to the \ndrawing board.\n  The percent of seniors in favor in my State is even lower. I have \nreceived over 1,000 calls from seniors opposed to this agreement, \nrepresenting about 80 percent of all calls.\n  Listen to what some of my constituents are saying about the bill:\n  Earl Dangler of Beverly Hills, FL said:\n\n\n[[Page S15604]]\n\n\n       This prescription drug benefit is going to cost my wife and \n     I an additional $750 to $1,000 per year whether we use it or \n     not.\n\n  Many of my constituents have expressed outrage at AARP for endorsing \nthis conference agreement.\n  One constituent said:\n\n       I'm really mad at the AARP and I am going to cancel my \n     subscription that I've had for 20 years.\n\n  Another constituent remarked:\n\n       I've been a member of AARP for many, many years, and I \n     can't believe that they have sold out to the pharmaceutical \n     industry and the insurance companies.\n\n  The real test of the reaction to this legislation is a bit down the \nroad--but it will come. The impact of the bill won't be felt until at \nleast 18 months after enactment.\n  I would predict the vote we cast on this legislation will be \npolitically inconsequential for those running in the year 2004. The \nstunning impact will be felt first in the fall of 2005, when Medicare \nbeneficiaries get the notice that it is time to enroll in the drug \nbenefit.\n  What choices would the senior face in 2005 when considering whether \nto enroll in the new, highly touted program?\n  Many Medicare beneficiaries will have to consider the following:\n  No. 1, sign up for a prescription drug plan, PDP--a private drug-only \ninsurance plan with no limits on the premium that may be charged, or \nNo. 2, enroll in a managed care plan.\n  Given that more than 85 percent of seniors today have rejected \nmanaged care, I anticipate a ``1980s''catastrophic outrage. But, that \nis not the end of the outrage. In fact, it may be just the beginning.\n   As the senior considers his choices, he will soon realize that the \nprivate plans hold all the cards. They have all the flexibility, all \nthe options, and none of the commitments.\n   The plan defines the classes, or categories of drugs, then decides \nwhat drug is in the class or category, and how much the senior will be \ncharged for the drug.\n  The plan doesn't even have to tell the senior prior to enrolling what \nthe charge for the drug will be, and can change which drugs are in each \ncategory at any point in the year.\n   But the senior? The senior has to make an enrollment decision prior \nto the beginning of each calendar year, based on limited and subject-\nto-change information, and cannot change plans at any time during the \nyear.\n   The private insurance plan can make changes during the year, but the \nsenior cannot.\n   Once enrolled, in the first part of the year 2006, seniors will \nbegin to feel the impact of the deck being stacked in favor of the \nprivate plans. They will discover that the plan can make changes to the \ndrugs covered and the price of the drugs at any time.\n   They will discover that the drug prices aren't all that low, and \nthey will discover that they have to pay the full cost for part or all \nof January as they struggle to meet the $250 deductible.\n   At this point, you may be thinking that things are bound to improve \nfor the senior. But, hold on, because the summer of 2006 is coming. \nWhat happens then? That is when, for the first time, seniors--voters--\nwill experience the infamous ``gap.'' Beginning sometime after Memorial \nDay 2006, many seniors will reach, and fall into, the gap.\n   At this point the senior has been going to the drugstore for about 6 \nmonths, each month filling prescriptions for treatment of any number of \nchronic illnesses.\n   The senior has met his or her deductible, has never missed a monthly \npremium payment, and dutifully has been paying 25 percent of the cost \nof each prescription.\n   But when the drugstore counter is reached in July, the senior finds \nhe is now responsible for paying 100 percent of the cost of the \nprescription, and yet still is responsible for paying the monthly \npremium.\n   I predict that by Labor Day of 2006, seniors will have made loud and \nclear their opinions about this prescription drug benefit.\n   And yet, there is still more ahead. In the year 2010, a vast \nexperiment called ``premium support'' will be imposed on millions of \nseniors in several parts of the country, including Florida.\n   Seniors in my State, as in others, will be forced to choose between \nenrolling in a health maintenance organization or paying a much higher \npremium to stay in the traditional fee-for-service Medicare Program.\n   Although we are beginning to hear the outrage now, it will be \nnothing compared to what we will hear in the summer of 2006.\n   The voters have been polled and my constituents have been calling, \nand they all cite many concerns with the bill--many of the same issues \nI mentioned a few moments ago. Each of these issues should be discussed \nin great detail, and I hope we have the time to do so.\n   Today, I am going to concentrate on one of the aspects of the bill \nthat I find to be the most troubling, and one that is shared by 64 \npercent of those polled: the legislation does little to contain drug \ncosts. The legislation actually forbids Medicare from negotiating with \nthe drug companies to reduce costs.\n   It doesn't seem to make much sense. A Medicare prescription drug \nbenefit should allow the Medicare Program to do whatever it can to get \nthe best possible prices from the drug companies. Why? Because both \nseniors and taxpayers would benefit.\n  Under this legislation, the majority of seniors would have to pay \neither 100 percent or 25 percent of the price of the drug--100 percent \nbefore the deductible is met, and during the time the senior is in the \nenormous ``gap'' in coverage, and 25 percent after the deductible and \nbefore reaching the ``gap.''\n  In 2001, the median income of a Medicare beneficiary was $19,688. \nAfter covering the cost of housing, food, and transportation, there \nisn't a lot left.\n  We need to make sure the prices are as low as possible so that our \nseniors are able to actually purchase the drugs they need to keep them \nwell.\n  Of course, the taxpayers would also benefit from Medicare serving as \na tough negotiator. The taxpayer is going to pay the portion not paid \nby the senior.\n  Both parties--the seniors and the taxpayers--have an interest in \nkeeping drug prices as low as possible. The party that does not share \nthat interest is the pharmaceutical industry.\n  The interests of that industry can be the only reason for a provision \nincluded at the top of page 54 of the conference report. The provision \nis designed to appear helpful by being called a ``noninterference'' \nclause.\n  What is a ``noninterference'' clause? According to the authors of \nthis legislation, it is the following:\n\n       Noninterference.--In order to promote competition under \n     this part and in carrying out this part, the Secretary--\n       (1) may not interfere with the negotiations between drug \n     manufacturers and pharmacies and PDP sponsors; and\n       (2) may not require a particular formulary or institute a \n     price structure for the reimbursement of covered part D \n     drugs.\n\n  Let me get this straight. A provision that prohibits the Secretary of \nHHS from negotiating with drug manufacturers to lower the price of \ndrugs--a provision that prohibits the Secretary from using the \npurchasing power of 41 million Medicare beneficiaries to lower the \nprice of drugs--and thus lower costs to seniors and taxpayers alike--is \n``noninterference''?\n  I put my money on this being a form of ``interference'' that senior \nwouldn't mind. Saying this provision is about not interfering, and \nabout promoting competition, is akin to the fox putting on the San \nDiego chicken costume and heading into the chicken coop to ``protect'' \nthe chickens.\n  This may sound like dry stuff. But it has very real life \nimplications. Take the case of Patricia Kittredge, a 71-year-old woman \nwho lives in Tamarac, FL.\n  She takes 6 different prescription drugs to stay healthy, which add \nup to $409 a month, or approximately $4,908 annually. Fortunately, her \nformer employer picks up the majority of these costs so that she pays \n$65 a month, or $781 annually.\n  A former credit analysis for a major employer in South Florida, Mrs. \nKittredge has good retiree health coverage. Yet she is far from \nwealthy. She makes about $18,000 a year when you combine her pension \nand Social Security income.\n  Because the conference bill does not allow the Medicare Program to \nnegotiate on her behalf--should Ms. Kittredge find herself among the 4 \nmillion Americans who will lose their retiree coverage--her out-of-\npocket costs, including her premium, will explode to $3,830.\n\n[[Page S15605]]\n\n  That is nearly 5 times what she currently spends, nearly 5 times what \nshe now pays, and nearly $4,000 in out-of-pocket drug costs on an \nincome of $18,000 a year. What kind of benefit is that?\n  But don't take my word for it, this is what Patricia Kittredge has to \nsay:\n\n       That would really hurt me. The handwriting is on the wall. \n     The companies that have retiree coverage will be walking away \n     from it to save money and won't feel bad about it at all.\n\n  Were Medicare able to use its bargaining power to negotiate with the \ndrug manufacturers, our seniors would likely see drug prices more in \nline with the VA drug prices. Mrs. Kittredge's drug costs under the \nproposed plan would decrease dramatically.\n  Yet the conference bill strictly forbids Medicare from using its \nbargaining power to negotiate lower drug prices for seniors.\n  How good are these VA prices? Let's compare the VA prices of Mrs. \nKittredge's drugs to their retail prices.\n  Diazepam, which Mrs. Kittredge takes to help her sleep, costs the VA \n$0.84 for one hundred 5 milligram tablets, while the same pills cost \n$16.70 at the drug store.\n  In addition, a month's supply of pravachol which she takes to \nregulate her cholesterol, costs the VA $19.80 at 40 mg per pill for the \nclinical equivalent, while the drug store charges $116.75 for the same \namount.\n  Mrs. Kittredge would face similarly high prices for her other \nprescriptions: a 20 mg dosage of accupril, a drug to treat her high \nblood pressure, costs the VA $7.69 for 30 pills goes for $32.00 at the \ndrug store.\n  Diltiazem, which Mrs. Kittredge also takes for her blood pressure, \ncosts $69.20 at the drug store but only $32 through the VA.\n  Metrocream, which she takes for a skin disorder, costs $69.99 at the \ndrug store compared to $25.13 through the VA.\n  If the Medicare bill we are now considering actively negotiated on \nMrs. Kittredge's behalf, she would likely pay prices more in line with \nthe prices available to veterans. Her total bill would be $2,188 rather \nthan the $3,830 as she will pay under the conference agreement.\n  Mrs. Kittredge's example is not unusual. Look at the price \ndifferentials between the VA price and the average retail price of some \ncommon drugs.\n  How is the VA able to secure such good prices for veterans?\n  In 1992, concerned about the prices veterans were paying for drugs, \nCongress passed the ``Veterans Health Care Act''--a Rockefeller, \nSimpson, Murkowski, Cranston amendment--by voice vote.\n  It is interesting that an issue that was and is so controversial \ncould be passed by voice vote. We are only asking that Medicare not be \nprohibited from negotiating prices for seniors.\n  This legislation gave the VA the authority it needed to secure better \ndrug prices for our veterans. What was the result of that legislation? \nIn the first 5 years alone, the VA saved more than $1 billion.\n  VA's savings have continued to grow exponentially, as both the cost \nof pharmaceuticals and the number of veterans seeking prescription \ndrugs have grown. The savings represent valuable Federal dollars that \nhave been used to provide quality health care to our Nation's veterans.\n  In addition, the savings on pharmaceuticals have allowed VA to \nprovide a long-term care benefit, including nursing home care, adult \nday care.\n  What are the implications of allowing Medicare to negotiate prices? \nIn 1998, the Inspector General, IG, of HHS, studied 34 drugs currently \ncovered by the Medicare program.\n  The IG found that Medicare and its beneficiaries could save more than \n$1 billion a year if the allowed amounts for just these 34 drugs were \nequal to the prices obtained by VA.\n  If the Medicare program were able to achieve similar savings on the \noutpatient drugs covered in this legislation, Congress would be able to \nprovide a much richer prescription drug benefit for the same $400 \nbillion we are proposing to spend now, reduce the costs to taxpayers, \nor both.\n  In terms of the drug benefit: we could give seniors a lower \ndeductible and fill in the gap; we could remove the gimmicky definition \nof what counts toward reaching the catastrophic limit so that employers \nwouldn't drop their retiree drug coverage; we could remove the assets \ntest; We could allow the Medicare Program to pay to the cost-sharing of \nour low-income seniors.\n  What would allowing Medicare to use its purchasing power do to the \npharmaceutical industry?\n  Some would have us believe that only the proposal we are discussing \ntoday would allow the industry to thrive and continue to develop life-\nsavings drugs.\n  But in June 1999, reaching to the prospect of a Medicare prescription \ndrug benefit, Merrill Lynch advised investors that\n\n     volume increases could overwhelm negative pricing impact. It \n     is important to remember that a reduction in prescription \n     drug prices, both with or without associated prescription \n     benefit coverage, is likely to be associated with price \n     elasticity and increased utilization.\n\n  The proposal before us fractures the Medicare market. One of the \ngreat strengths of the Medicare Program has been its universality. \nSeniors from Anchorage to Key West knew they would get the same \nbenefits for the same premium.\n  The proposal before us also uses scarce Federal dollars in an attempt \nto force private insurers into a line of business they have repeatedly \nsaid they do not want to enter.\n  Instead, we should be using the purchasing power of the nearly 41 \nmillion Medicare beneficiaries waiting for a drug benefit to drive down \nprices--for their benefit, and for the taxpayers benefit.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print an editorial at the conclusion of my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDENT OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I'd like to quote from the November 21st Miami Herald, \nwhich editorialized as follows:\n\n       The problem: Instead of using the free market to drive down \n     the costs of prescription drugs, the bill would protect \n     pharmaceutical companies from competition and pay more than \n     $100 billion in incentives to employers and insurers in an \n     attempt to make its flawed logic work. The bill also \n     threatens to cap future Medicare spending.\n       True, the measure promises prescription-drug coverage for \n     low-income seniors not already covered by Medicaid and would \n     benefit seniors with extremely high prescription costs. But \n     its coverage for middle-class seniors is modest at best.\n       That's just not enough benefit for a 10-year price tag of \n     $400 billion that will add to the skyrocketing Federal \n     deficit, especially when it doesn't even contain the cost of \n     prescription drugs.\n       A better, more logical approach would be to harness the \n     buying power of the 40 million Medicare seniors to drive down \n     drug costs. But this bill actually would prohibit the \n     government from doing so. Instead it would dissect the \n     country into 10 regions and pay incentives to companies--$12 \n     billion to private insurers and $1.6 billion to HMOs--so \n     they'll offer prescription-drug coverage.\n\n  For the Record, I'd like to make one correction in the otherwise \nexcellent editorial. Under the latest version of the bill, between 10 \nand 50 regions would be allowed--further dissecting the country.\n  The last drug benefit endorsed by the AARP was the Medicare \nCatastrophic Coverage Act. We all know how seniors felt about that drug \nbenefit, and it was quickly repealed.\n  If we adopt the proposal before us, we will be turning a deaf ear to \nhistory, and to the seniors across the country today who are already \ntelling us--through AARP card burnings, through the messages they are \nwriting on the AARP ``message board'', and through the hundreds and \nhundreds of calls from seniors we've been receiving over the last \nweek--that we need to get back to work.\n  This drug ``benefit'' is actually no such thing. It leaves millions \nof seniors worse off.\n  Along with many others, I have worked to provide an affordable, \ncomprehensive, reliable prescription drug benefit for our seniors and \ncitizens with disabilities for the last several years.\n  It is therefore with great regret that I have no choice but to vote \nagainst a conference report that does not provide the benefit seniors \nneed, and have been promised.\n  If the proposal is adopted--and I sincerely hope it is not--it will \nnot be the last chapter. Seniors won't stand for it.\n  I predict voters will put Congress on the hook in 2006, and we will \nspend many, many years attempting to fix\n\n[[Page S15606]]\n\nthis deeply flawed legislation--or will repeal it outright as we did \nwith the catastrophic legislation.\n  Or we could have the worst of both worlds.\n  We could repeal the prescription drug benefit because the benefits \nare too meager, its subsidies of health maintenance organizations are \ntoo great, and its delivery system too confusing and disrespectful.\n  And what would be the price of repealing the drug benefit?\n  We would leave the privatization of Medicare in place and destroy one \nof the Federal Governments most effective, efficient and popular \nprograms: traditional fee-for-service Medicare.\n  In the event the legislation before us does become law, I plan to use \nmy last year in Congress working to fix it. Our seniors need better \nfrom us.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                 [From the Miami Herald, Nov. 21, 2003]\n\n                  When Half a Loaf Isn't Nearly Enough\n\n\n       our opinion: reject the flawed medicare prescription bill\n\n       With its $7 million ad campaign to win support for the \n     Medicare prescription-drug bill, AARP says that the \n     legislation ``isn't perfect. But millions of Americans can't \n     afford to wait for perfect.'' We agree with AARP's assessment \n     of the bill but not its conclusion.\n       The proposed bill is badly flawed. It delivers too few \n     benefits to seniors at too big a cost. Americans don't need \n     perfect, but for $400 billion they deserve a bill that helps \n     more people and drives down the high costs of prescription \n     drugs. The proposed bill does little of either. Congress \n     should reject it and try again.\n       The problem: Instead of using the free market to drive down \n     the costs of prescription drugs, the bill would protect \n     pharmaceutical companies from competition and pay more than \n     $100 billion in incentives to employers and insurers in an \n     attempt to make its flawed logic work. The bill also \n     threatens to cap future Medicare spending.\n       True, the measure promises prescription-drug coverage for \n     low-income seniors not already covered by Medicaid and would \n     benefit seniors with extremely high prescription costs. But \n     its coverage for middle-class seniors is modest at best. \n     That's just not enough for a 10-year price tag of $400 \n     billion that will add to the skyrocketing federal deficit, \n     especially when it doesn't even contain the cost of \n     prescription drugs.\n\n                         Don't repeat the past\n\n       A better, more logical approach would be to harness the \n     buying power of the 40 million Medicare seniors to drive down \n     drug costs. But this bill actually would prohibit the \n     government from doing so. Instead it would dissect the \n     country into 10 regions and pay incentives to companies--$12 \n     billion to private insurers and $1.6 billion to HMOs--so \n     they'll offer prescription-drug coverage.\n       We've tried such incentives before with HMOs, and \n     experience shows that they didn't work. Half of the Medicare \n     Plus Choice plans provided by HMOs have folded, even though \n     taxpayers still pay more to subsidize a senior in a Medicare \n     HMO than a senior in traditional Medicare.\n       The compromise measure also guts provisions that would have \n     allowed seniors to legally buy prescription-drugs from \n     Canada, another concession to pharmaceutical companies, some \n     of which now are retaliating against Canadian wholesalers who \n     sell to Americans.\n\n                           The doughnut hole\n\n       The standard coverage that the bill offers would only \n     benefit a senior who spends more than $835 a year, or some \n     $70 a month, on drugs. Then there's the ``hole in the \n     doughnut'' coverage gap in which the government's 75-percent \n     subsidy stops after $2,200 in out-of-pocket cash has been \n     spent. If out-of-pocket spending reaches $3,600, the subsidy \n     kicks in again, this time at 95 percent of drug cost. \n     Deductibles and co-payments are complicated enough without \n     trying to explain the ``hole in the doughnut'' to elderly \n     recipients.\n       AARP and other supporters say that even a flawed benefit is \n     better than nothing. They reason that once passed, bad \n     provisions could be changed before they go into effect. But \n     why fix later what should be fixed now?\n       Seniors deserve affordable prescription-drug coverage. \n     Congress should scrap this flawed approach and come up with a \n     plan that delivers that coverage while driving costs down.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 5 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/23/senate-section/article/S15606-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15606-S15644]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HAPPY 90TH BIRTHDAY, DAD\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, today my father, Van Johnson, is \ncelebrating his 90th birthday. He is joined by my mother Ruth, my \nbrother and sister and their spouses, dad's sister Ardis, and a great \nmany wonderful friends. I had long planned to be there to join in this \ncelebration, but the Senate failed to adjourn on time, and now is \nstaying in session through the weekend and into next week in an effort \nto conclude legislative business which should have been completed \nmonths ago.\n  The good people of South Dakota honored me by electing me to \nrepresent their interests and values in the Senate, and I simply cannot \nneglect those duties by leaving Washington today.\n  While I cannot be with dad on this very special day in his life, I \nrise to express my long appreciation for a father who has always been \nthere for me. Dad taught me about the importance of family, of \nfatherhood, of faith, and of personal integrity. He taught me about the \nimportance of public service--that life is more than about the \ncollection of things, and that helping make the world a better place \nis, indeed, a central purpose to our lives.\n  Dad was there for me, whether it involved the countless family \ncamping trips, athletic events, school work, or church activities--all \nat a time when he was intensely busy with his own career as a highly \nregarded teacher, coach, professor, and university administrator. He \nand mom were and are a great team, and my brother Tom and my sister \nJulie and I have benefited all our lives from their loving guidance and \ncare.\n  As a father of three children, and now a new grandfather myself, I \ncontinue to draw from the values imparted to me from my father and find \nwith each passing year how profoundly important they are.\n  But dad, although an educator all his adult life, did not teach \nexclusively in a pedagogical manner. Many of the greatest things I \nlearned from dad came from observing his example--his commitment to our \nfamily, his love for mom, his dedication to professional excellence, \nand his willingness to assume leadership roles in the church and in our \ncommunity.\n  Dad, it deeply disappoints me that I cannot be with you today, but \nknow that I am with you in thought and spirit. Happy 90th birthday, \ndad.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, Senator Nickles is in the building. I do \nnot know if he is going to speak.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I rise to speak on the Medicare bill \nthat is before us. First, I compliment a couple colleagues with whom I \nhave had the pleasure of working on this bill, particularly in the \nconference committee. First would certainly be Senator Grassley who, in \nleading the Senate conferees, I think did an outstanding job. I also \nwould echo that for the majority leader. The majority leader seldom \ngets involved in a conference. This majority leader, Dr. Bill Frist, \nhas an interest in Medicare and he was a very influential member of the \nconference. In addition, Senator Kyl, Senator Hatch, Senator Baucus, \nand Senator Breaux and, I would also include, Chairman Thomas.\n  This was a very challenging conference between the House and the \nSenate. The bill that was reported out of the Senate--I did not vote \nfor it. I thought it was very heavy on expense and very light on \nreforms. I did not really think it was a sustainable bill, one that we \nor our children could afford. So I worked very diligently, I guess, or \nvery aggressively, trying to come up with a conference report that \nwould meet the test, that would provide better benefits at a \nsustainable level.\n  I think the present Medicare system has crummy benefits. It does not \ncover a lot of things that should be covered. It is so far behind the \ntimes, I really did want to modernize it. I also wanted to add the new \nbenefits in a way that would be affordable and sustainable.\n  Under the present situation in Medicare, just to give people a little \nthumbnail sketch--and this is without providing any new benefits--the \ntotal debt held by the public is $3.6 trillion. Social Security \nunfunded liabilities is about $4.6 trillion. Medicare is almost three \ntimes as much. It is $13.3 trillion,\n\n[[Page S15607]]\n\nand that is without adding a new benefit, which most people would \nestimate to be $6 trillion or $7 trillion. So my colleagues can see we \nhave an enormous challenge before us.\n  Then just look at Medicare today. There is a lot more money going out \nthan coming in. Medicare is primarily financed by two things. One is \npayroll taxes; 2.9 percent of all payroll, not capped at the same \namount that Social Security is up to the 80,000-something dollars. It \nis 2.9 percent of all payroll. That is the money going in. It is also \nfinanced by general revenue. We subsidize Part B.\n  If it is added all together and we take out the intergovernmental \ntransfers, Medicare had net deficits last year--in 2002--of almost $70 \nbillion. It gets a lot worse--by 2012 the deficit will be above $150 \nbillion. That is present law. That is without adding a new benefit. So \nMedicare is in very difficult fiscal waters, a lot more challenging \nthan even Social Security, a lot more challenging than any other \nprogram because demographically there are a lot of people who are \nliving longer, health care expenses are exploding, and there are fewer \npeople paying the payroll tax. So it is going to take a greater share \nof general revenue, money from taxpayers to pay for these obligations.\n  So I thought, let's provide better benefits. What do I mean by that? \nMedicare does not provide drug benefits. Everyone knows that. Medicare \nalso has unaffordable deductibles. It has a deductible for the hospital \nof $840. I compare this to what the private sector offers. If a person \nbuys Blue Cross or Aetna, any of the private plans, they do not have an \n$840 deductible to pay if they go in the hospital for one day, but \nMedicare does. All private plans certainly should--I think most do--\nhave catastrophic. Medicare does not have catastrophic.\n  If a person is really in trouble, if they are in the hospital more \nthan 150 days, it is all on them; they do not get any help from \nMedicare. I think that is pathetic. That is not a very good benefit. As \na matter of fact, if someone is in the hospital more than 60 days, they \nhave to pay $210 a day. If they are in the hospital more than 90 days, \nthey have to pay $420 a day. So if someone is really sick, if they are \nreally in trouble, look out, Medicare does not come through. So it is a \nprogram that has, frankly, not been modernized since its creation in \n1965.\n\n  Medicare does not do enough for preventive care. It does not offer \nprescription drugs. It does not have catastrophic. Its deductibles are \nway too high for hospitalization. So I think it needs significant \nimprovement.\n  I want to pass a Medicare bill that will help solve all of these \nproblems. I want to pass a bill that will provide drug benefits. I \nthink we are way behind the times. We should be doing it. I also want \nto be cognizant of the fact that Medicare is in real financial trouble, \nthat it is not sustainable in its present form. I do not want to be \nadding new benefits that will just accelerate the day where it \ncollapses, where it is not sustainable, where our kids are going to be \nsaying: What about this tax?\n  Some people say: Well, this is not a tax. And that is correct, we are \nnot creating a direct tax to pay for the new benefits, but what we are \ndoing is incurring enormous debt to pay for benefits. Frankly, our kids \nare either going to be paying for that in the form of taxation tomorrow \nor they are going to be paying for it in an increased interest rate \nbecause debts will increase substantially under this bill.\n  The budget resolution we passed last year said we should strengthen \nand enhance Medicare. That means make it more solvent, more \nsustainable, more affordable. Unfortunately, I am not sure we did that \nunder this bill. In fact, we focused too many resources in this bill to \ncover the covered and not improve Medicare.\n  What do I mean by that? If we look at this chart, we find out that 76 \npercent of seniors now have prescription drug coverage, but we are \ngoing to spend billions, almost $100 billion, to provide assistance to \nthose people who already have drug coverage. For employer-sponsored \nplans, for example, we are going to spend $89 billion to subsidize \nemployers so they can continue providing health care benefits, drug \nbenefits, for their employees. We are going to bribe them to keep \ncovering the people they have already contractually obligated to cover. \nThis is a big bailout, in my opinion, for employer plans, union plans. \nIt is way too high of a subsidy. I know AARP wanted these subsidies and \nin fact wanted more money.\n  Now, some people were criticizing Senator Baucus. Mr. Hunt in the \nWall Street Journal criticized him as a negotiator. I take issue with \nthat. He was a very successful negotiator because in the last several \ndays of negotiating the bill--we spent months negotiating--Senator \nBaucus was a very effective negotiator. He kept winning. I kept losing. \nWe were on opposite sides in many battles. I complimented him. I said: \nYou just keep winning.\n  He got more money for the employer and union subsidy, another $18 \nbillion in the last few days to cover the covered. It went from $71 \nbillion to $89 billion by making it tax free. He also got an additional \n$18.5 billion for low-income subsidies and more benefits. That makes \nthe bill more expensive and I think will make utilization go way up. So \nI compliment Senator Baucus for his negotiations, but I also think it \nmakes the bill less sustainable or less affordable for future \ngenerations.\n  So we spend a lot of money to take care of employer sponsored. I also \nhave issues with covering the covered in the Medicaid program. We have \nlow-income subsidies in this bill not just for those who are higher \nincomes than Medicaid but for the Medicaid population that is dually \neligible. We have subsidies in this bill for low-income to the tune of \n$190-some billion. These are subsidies for seniors which many of whom \nalready had drug coverage. So what is the total package? Everybody says \nthis package is a $395 billion package. In reality it is much more than \nthat. In reality, this bill is closer to $800 billion. It nets out \nabout $400 billion. It is $800 billion because we have $507 billion in \ndrug benefits, but we also have low-income subsidies of $192 billion, \nand we have employer subsidies of $89 billion. If you add that up, it \nis almost $800 billion of checks that are going to be written. The \nFederal Government is going to be writing those checks.\n\n  The Federal Government will be receiving money back in the form of \npremiums from seniors, $131 billion, and a reach-back or call-back from \nthe States. Since we are assuming Medicaid, which in my opinion is a \nserious mistake, one that was opposed by the administration and \ncertainly opposed by this Senator, but we were not successful. It was \nnot the Senate position to assume federalization of Medicaid. Medicaid \nis a Federal-State program. It is now an all-Federal program when this \nbill becomes law. Again, we are covering the covered. We are going to \nsubsidize Medicaid to the tune of $190-some billion in this bill. That \nis a lot.\n  We recoup some of the money we were paying. Now it is all Medicare, \nso the offset will say we will spend less in Medicaid because we are \nnot going to do that. In the future we will make it all Medicare. The \nnet is--we will spend $800 billion, recoup $400 billion--so the net \ncost to future generations is about $400 billion. Yes, that meets the \nso-called budget restraint we put in, in this year's budget. But we \ndidn't finance that, we don't pay for it, so we have benefits, frankly, \nthat are certainly overpromised and underfunded. They are not funded. \nThe $400 billion is not funded. That is just additional debt.\n  I happen to think it will be a lot more than that. I happen to think \nonce you end up paying some benefits you will find that utilization \nwill skyrocket. This is just what CBO has told us. People without drug \ncoverage in this age category spend about $732 on their drugs per year. \nIf they have drug coverage, they spend about double that, $1,337.\n  I think this figure will skyrocket. I asked my mother: Do you have \ndrug coverage? She said yes. She buys it with AARP. She pays $140 or \n$160 a month for drug coverage. I said: How much is your drug coverage?\n  It is 50 percent of whatever she spends up to $1,000. She gets $500 \nin drug benefits from AARP. She pays almost $1,000 for that $500. Maybe \nthere are some other benefits in there I am not aware of. My point is, \na lot of people have drug coverage, but they only have a little drug \ncoverage. The reason I say this bill may not be sustainable or \naffordable is because 36 percent of\n\n[[Page S15608]]\n\nall Medicare seniors are going to get an enormous benefit and they pay \nalmost nothing. They will have only $1 and $3 copays, or $2 and $5 \ncopays; in most cases they will have no premiums, deductibles or gap in \ncoverage.\n  I have heard some colleagues say we should be doing that for \neverybody. Let me just give you an example of who is pushing that \nproposition. I saw that AARP ran an ad today and is asked: Why should \nyou vote for this bill? They had three or four reasons. If you have \nincome less than 100 percent of the federal poverty level--for an \nindividual, that is $9,600; for a couple it would be $13,000, this is \nthe best deal you have ever seen because all you have to pay is $1 if \nyou are buying a generic, or $3 if you are buying a brand-name drug, \nand you have unlimited drugs--no limit, no deductible, no copay other \nthan that $1 and $3; no premiums, and no donut hole. That is unlimited. \nAll you have to pay is $1 to $3 and all your drugs--whether they are \n$5,000 or $10,000--are all covered.\n  It is almost the same if you have an income of less than 135 percent \nof poverty. That would be for individuals with $13,000 and a couple \nwith $17,600 of income. If they have less, they have the same thing, \nexcept their copay is $2 and $5. There is no donut hole, no \ncatastrophic, no limitation. They don't have to pay premiums, no $35 a \nmonth in premiums. They have a great benefit. They should be \ncelebrating.\n\n  I am surprised to hear some of our colleagues on the other side say \nthey can't support this bill because it is not a very good deal. If \nthey are so-called champions of the poor, this is the most generous \nfederalization of a government benefit in U.S. history. Maybe they are \nignoring the low-income subsidies. It is not insignificant--$192 \nbillion according to CBO. I think it is so much more than that. I think \nwhen people find out their only copay is $1 or $3 or even $2 and $5, \nutilization will skyrocket. This chart will be so inaccurate.\n  We will find out if we have underestimated the impact of providing a \nfederal benefit upwards of a 90 percent subsidy. In a few years we will \nfind out. People who don't have to pay much--in other words, if the \nGovernment is paying 90-some-odd percent of it, 95 or 97 percent, which \nwould be the case in many of these income categories, utilization will \nskyrocket. At least that is my opinion. Maybe I am wrong. We will find \nout. I am making this statement for the record because I think this \nbenefit is going to cost a lot more than people estimate. I think \nutilization will skyrocket.\n  For individuals who have incomes less than $14,500, or as a couple, \n$19,500, between that 135 percent and 150 percent of poverty, their \ncopay is 15 percent. The Government is going to pay 85 percent. Again--\nno donut hole. They will have a reduced sliding scale premium and a \nreduced deductible of $50. This too is an enormous benefit that will \nskyrocket.\n  People who have incomes above 150 percent of poverty, they have a \ncopay of 25 percent. Then you are getting into the area where it is not \nquite as good as what they had in the private sector. So my point is, \nfor low income, for that 36 percent of Medicare seniors, for about 14 \nmillion seniors, this is one great package. My guess is, it will \nexplode in cost.\n  Another reason I think it will explode in cost is because a lot of \nour colleagues will say whatever we pass, that is just the beginning. I \nthink Senator Kennedy alluded to that when this passed the Senate: This \nis a beginning and he wants to expand upon it. I believe that is what \nAARP says: We will take this and expand upon it.\n  How do you expand upon it? Well, let's just fill the donut hole. In \nother words, the basic benefit after you get past the low-income \nsubsidies, the basic again goes up to $2,250. Then above that amount \nyou have to basically self-insure or in other words you pay the next \ncouple of thousand dollars on your own before the Federal Government \ncatastrophic kicks in.\n  A lot of people would say: Let's just fill that donut hole up. We \ndon't have that donut hole in the private sector, we should not have it \nin this. If you fill that up, in other words, if Government expands its \nliability, the cost of this program goes up by the hundreds of billions \nof dollars--hundreds of billions of dollars. In fact, one does not have \nto predict that this will happen, it actually already did. The \nConference Committee negotiated an initial benefit level of $2,200. \nThis was an agreement. Tuesday night, armed with a CBO score that was \nunder $400 billion the negotiators closed the donut by $50. This cost \n$4 billion. I have no doubt in my mind that once this passes, future \nCongresses will be working to fill that donut hole, and my guess is \nthey will be successful. My guess is they will be successful in \nincreasing the number of people eligible for these enormous low-income \nsubsidies. It doesn't have to be 150 percent. As a matter of fact, the \nSenate bill passed at 160 percent of poverty. So I am sure there will \nbe amendments year by year to increase that level up for the super \ngovernment benefit. Let's make that eligible up to $30,000 or $40,000 \nso that will be happening.\n  I also think areas in which there are significant savings in the \nbill--and I was involved in this--the reach-back, where we try to \nrecapture a portion of the savings going to States we will see slowly \nundone. My guess after this becomes law, States will be lobbying us \nextensively: You are taking too much back. We want that reduced. In \nfact the reach-back provision was reduced just this past week at a cost \nto the taxpayers of $4 billion.\n  I am afraid in many cases States will continue to be successful. So \nthat cost will explode. As a matter of fact, I will make a prediction. \nWithin a few years, the donut hole will be eliminated, the reach-back \nby States will be reduced dramatically, and the expansion of low-income \ndefinition will be enlarged tremendously, so the cost of this bill will \nmore than double, more than double. That is just my guesstimate. I may \nnot be in the Senate when that happens, but my guess is it will happen.\n  What is my other complaint about the bill? Its explosive nature in \ncost. I knew it would cost a lot. I knew it would explode. One of the \nthings I really wanted to do was come up with some reforms that would \nhelp make this program more sustainable, more affordable for the \nfuture.\n  Presently, we have a system that is bifurcated. We have Medicare \nhospitalization. That is called Part A. It has Part B for doctors. It \nwill now have a new part D for prescription drugs. The benefits are not \nintegrated.\n  A lot of people also buy Medigap. Under present law they buy A and B \nand they buy Medigap. So it is not a very good integrated system, \nunlike the private sector. The private sector offers the benefits that \nI said that Medicare lacks. I wanted to have an integrated private-\nsector alternative to the present Medicare system, one that people \ncould look at and say: Wait a minute, this works better. I think I \nwould rather be in the everyday private sector type system, the same \none Federal employees have, the same one private sector employees have.\n  They have better plans. They have a better package. It is more \nmodern. It is not tied to a government-controlled fee-for-service \nsystem that does not work. Do you want the private sector to become a \n1965 Medicare fee for service model? This bill is spending billions and \nbillions of dollars to make adjustments for doctors and hospitals and \nproviders because government is underfunding them? That is not the \nprivate market and we should not tie them to Medicare's price controls.\n  Senator Grassley has been a champion for increasing assistance to \nrural areas, and he is exactly right. The present system hasn't worked \nvery well. I wanted to come up with a more modern system with \nintegrated benefits that integrates Part A, Part B, and Part D--\nhospitals, doctors, and prescription drugs--and avoid the necessity of \na Medigap plan. People had to have Medigap because Medicare alone \ndidn't pay for a lot of benefits, and it had too high of a deductible. \nPeople had to buy Medigap. They shouldn't have to do that. I was hoping \nwe could come up with a good, reasonable integrated system. I am afraid \nthat maybe we haven't quite attained that. I am afraid our reforms are \nreally not adequate for the explosiveness of the benefits we are \nlooking at today.\n  Let me touch on the integrated benefit. I have heard some people say \nthis is a ripoff because we are giving money to insurance companies; \nthat it should be done by the Government. I have already mentioned that \nGovernment doesn't do a very good job in providing\n\n[[Page S15609]]\n\nthe benefits today. Now we are trying to have the private sector come \nin after Part D, the private sector for a prescription drug package. \nNobody in the real market right now offers to Medicare beneficiaries or \nfor that matter anyone a stand-alone drug benefit. We hope and pray \nthey will in the future. But if they do, they will have to basically \noffer exactly what we told them to offer, and that is the benefit \nstructure of 75-25 up to $2,250. We are limiting the private sector to \nonly offering a government-designed benefit.\n  There is this big donut hole in the government standard benefit and \nwe have a governmental catastrophic, some call it Government \nreinsurance--which ties the hands of the private sector and denies \nseniors the best the private sector has to offer. For example, After \nyou spend $3,600 of your own money, then Government reinsurance will \nkick in, and individual beneficiary will be liable for 5 percent. The \nGovernment is responsible for 80 percent of all costs above the $3,600 \n``true out of pocket'', the health plan is covering 15 percent and the \nindividual 5%. The private sector is not able to assume full risk and \noffer the benefits they want. If the private health plans did offer \nincreased benefits they would lose or delay government subsidies. This \nis crazy. All they are able to offer is basically the basic benefit up \nto the $2,250, or the actuarial equivalent, but they are not able to \noffer both. They are not able to say they will take all of Part D--that \nthey will assume all of Part D and combine it with Part A and Part B \nand use efficiencies between the system having an integrated benefit \nand maybe doing something better in hospitalization and doctors, have \nsome savings and offer a more generous drug benefit. They are not able \nto do that because under this bill, they are required to maintain this \ntrue out-of-pocket cost. This bill puts the private plans in straight \njacket.\n  I think that is very unfortunate. It really kind of locks in an \ninflexible structure. We are telling the private sector, which have \nextensive experience in offering comprehensive benefits for all types \nof individuals including public and private sector employee and \nindividuals, that they have to sell a government benefit. They can not \noffer a plan with prescription drugs for our seniors without having a \ndonut hole. We are mandating that they have that before they can get \ninto catastrophic. I find that to be very unfortunate and very \nshortsighted and maybe even unworkable. It doesn't really transcend the \nmovement to private sector. It doesn't trust the private sector. By \ndoing that, I am afraid we have put in a rigidity that won't allow it \nto work as we would like for it to.\n  We did not get cost containment. We tried. Maybe I should say we have \nminor cost containment. We did put in a provision that says if general \nrevenue contributions exceed 45 percent, the President shall come up \nwith a plan to fix it, and Congress has some procedures. Nothing \nmandates Congress do it. We tell the President he should. That is years \naway. I find that to be a little hollow. I wanted real cost \ncontainment. It was opposed by many--particularly on the Democrat \nside--and we weren't successful in getting that in. That is \nunfortunate.\n\n  There are several provisions in this bill that are good. I want to \ncompliment again Senator Grassley and Chairman Thomas. We did get \nhealth savings accounts. It is not directly related to Medicare, but I \nthink it would help reform health care as we know it. People would \nactually be spending their own money. I think that is a very positive \nand a good significant change, and it will change people's behavior. \nThat is about $6 billion or $7 billion. That is very positive. I \ncompliment Senator Grassley and Chairman Thomas especially for putting \nthat in.\n  We did put in income-relating Part B premiums. Senator Feinstein and \nI worked on that amendment on the Senate floor. We included a lot of \nthat in the bill, not exactly as we put it in the bill on the Senate \nfloor, but I think that is a positive change. But to my regret, it puts \nmore money in the bill, and basically we spent that money.\n  We did get income-related Part B. Basically, that means we are going \nto have less subsidies for higher income people. Part B has always been \npaid for. When it was created, it was 50 percent for individuals. Over \nthe years that has been declining. Now the individual only pays 25 \npercent, and the Federal Government pays 75 percent.\n  What we said is if you have income above $80,000 up to $100,000, \neventually you have to pay 35 percent. If you have individual income \nabove $100,000, eventually you have to go up to 50 percent where it \nused to be. If you have incomes much higher than that, you will have to \npay 65 percent, or you will have to pay 80 percent. Even very wealthy \npeople will still get a 20-percent subsidy under this provision. I \nthink that is good reform.\n  We also index Part B deductibles. It has been $100 for a long time. \nNow we index that to the cost of the program. Those are good changes. \nThey will help improve it. Unfortunately, the savings to the taxpayers \nas a result of these changes have already been spent in this bill. As a \nmatter of fact, in the 2 or 3 days of negotiations, we amended the \nbenefits and the subsidies in the bill by about $40 billion. Most of \nthe good done by the income-relating of the Part B premiums and the \nindexing of the deductible were undone.\n  I have no doubt that in future Congresses that the current 75 percent \nup to that $2,250 subsidy will be changed and the $2,250 is going to be \nclimbing up. I have no doubt that people will say we need the most \ngenerous subsidies and low-income subsidies which needs to apply to a \nlot of other people. It will increase spending dramatically.\n  My point is, Yes. We made some reforms, but this program may not be \naffordable or sustainable. Right now, it is estimated to cost $400 \nbillion over the next 10 years. The program doesn't even start for a \ncouple of years; that is, over the next 8 years. The Congressional \nBudget Office directive said that in the next 10 years they thought \nthis program might cost up to $1.5 trillion to $1.7 trillion. That is \nwith the benefits structure as we have outlined it today. As it \nexpands, it will be much more than $1.7 trillion. When the donut hole \nis filled--and I predict it will be--when you have the number of \neligibles increase dramatically to receive the low-income subsidies, \nwhen we reduce the reach-back or claw-back from States, this $1.7 \nbillion in the next decade will probably be much more than that.\n  That brings me to my final comment. Can we sustain it? I am not sure. \nIt looks to me like we are building a brand new deck on a house with a \nvery unstable foundation. I think we are expanding this program like it \nis on a solid foundation, and it is not. We are not paying for these \nnew benefits. We are saddling our future generations with enormous \nliability.\n  I conclude by saying I have the greatest respect for the chairman of \nthe committee. I have the greatest respect for the majority leader. I \nwant them to be successful. I want the President to be successful, and \nI want senior citizens to have prescription drugs. I want them to have \na modern Medicare system. This bill takes some steps in those \ndirections, but my conclusion is that the benefits greatly exceed the \nreforms. Without necessary reform, I am not sure this program will be \nsustainable in the future. So it is my intention not to support this \nbill.\n  Also, I want to compliment some people who have worked very \nenergetically on this bill. One is my staff, Stacey Hughes, who has \njust worked unbelievable hours; on Senator Grassley's staff, Linda \nFishman and Mark Hayes, and the Senate legislative counsel. There are a \nlot of people who have put in more hours than you can imagine to put \nforth this bill. I compliment them for their efforts. They worked in a \nvery positive way. It is a pleasure to work with them and to work with \nthe chairman.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute five seconds.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield that time to the Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I certainly think the cooperation we \nhave had from the chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Nickles, \nhelped to move this bill along. Even though he has not liked some parts \nof the bill, he has been cooperative all the way through the process \nand, more importantly, through the crucial time of conference.\n\n[[Page S15610]]\n\n  There is a claim that pharmacies are concerned about beneficiary \naccess to pharmacies, pricing transparency issues, and insurance risk.\n  I understand the concerns of pharmacists with regard to local access. \nThis bill provides several provisions to ensure that Medicare \nbeneficiaries are provided with adequate choice and easy accessibility \nto local pharmacies.\n  First, the conference report provides choice to beneficiaries by \ncontaining an ``any willing provider'' provision. This provision \nrequires prescription drug plans to accept any and all pharmacies \nwilling to agree to the terms and conditions of the plan. By adding \nthis provision, we have given all pharmacies, big and small, the chance \nto participate in the modernization of Medicare.\n  Second, the conference report provides beneficiaries with convenient \naccess to pharmacies by adopting the TRICARE standard for prescription \ndrug plans. In urban areas, 90 percent of beneficiaries would have a \npharmacy within two miles of their residence; 90 percent of \nbeneficiaries in suburban areas would have access to a pharmacy within \nfive miles of their home; In rural areas, plans would be required to \nprovide 70 percent of beneficiaries with a pharmacy 15 miles within \ntheir residence.\n  By adopting this standard, beneficiaries are ensured adequate \nconvenient access to pharmacies of their choice.\n  The conference report also requires that plans permit beneficiaries \nthe ability to fill their prescriptions at a community pharmacy rather \nthan through the mail. Again, ensuring access to local pharmacies.\n  In addition to providing convenient, local access to pharmacies, the \nconference report provides safeguards to ensure fair drug pricing and \nprotects pharmacies from insurance risk.\n  Under the report, pharmacy benefit manager's, PBMs, would be required \nto disclose all discounts, rebates, and charge backs given to them by \ndrug manufacturers. This places local pharmacies on a fair playing \nfield with PBMs.\n  The report also prevents insurance risk to pharmacies by clarifying \nthat pharmacies could not accept insurance risk.\n  This conference report adequately addresses the concerns of \npharmacies and pharmacists alike. It makes sure that beneficiaries have \nlocal and convenient access to pharmacies, provides transparency \npricing, and protects pharmacies from insurance risk.\n\n\n                      Revisions to H. Con. Res. 95\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, section 401 of H. Con. Res. 95, the \nbudget resolution, permits the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee \nto make adjustments to the allocation of budget authority and outlays \nto the Senate Committee on Finance, provided certain conditions are met \npursuant to section 401.\n  I hereby submit the following revisions to H.

The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Parliamentary inquiry. This, of course, has nothing to do \nwith the legislation. It is my understanding the action of the \ndistinguished chairman of the Budget Committee would not be in \nderogation of the consent order before the Senate for debate today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair's understanding is that changes in \nthe allocation being submitted by the Senator are just being printed in \nthe Record.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I believe we ought to reject this Medicare \nbill. When I look at it carefully--which has been hard because there \nhas not been a lot of time--it is clear it is a cruel hoax for seniors \nand a cynical giveaway to drug companies and to the insurance industry. \nEven as we speak, there are lobbyists scurrying around Capitol Hill \nworking feverishly to pass a bill that has already driven up the stock \nof those corporations I have mentioned, the insurance industry and drug \ncompanies across the country. The rise in that stock tells the story \nabout the windfall profits that come with this bill.\n  With the help of President Bush, they produced a Medicare bill that \nlines the pockets of the powerful moneyed interests and it leaves \nAmerica's seniors out in the cold. This bill is less about prescription \ndrug benefits and more about a prescription to benefit large drug \ncompanies. America's seniors deserve better.\n  As I have traveled around the country and heard from countless \nnumbers of seniors about their health care needs, they repeat again and \nagain how they need and they want more affordable prescription drugs. \n``More affordable'' are key words when measured against this bill. They \nneed and want a quality Medicare plan--I emphasize Medicare plan--that \nlets seniors choose their own doctors, their own hospitals, and \nprovides prescription drug coverage.\n  I have met seniors across the country who have cut their medication, \nthey have cut the dosage in half, because they cannot afford their \nprescription drugs. I met a woman the other day who could not even \nafford to start her prescription drugs because the initial bill was \n$100 and she did not have the cash. I met people in small businesses \nwho have seen their health care premiums more than double because drug \nprices are rising so fast. And I met seniors in New Hampshire and \nelsewhere who have no idea how they are going to possibly pay their \nrent and cover the prescription drugs they need.\n  When we break past the advertising bought and paid for by the special \ninterests to sell this bill as something it is not, we will notice that \nAmerica's seniors are outraged by what they have seen already about \nthis legislation. I was at a forum the other day sponsored by AARP, and \nwhen it was mentioned what was happening in the bill, seniors booed \ntheir own leadership in the AARP. It is no wonder AARP members are \ntearing up or burning their cards.\n  For Senators who are planning to vote for this bill, I ask a very \nstraightforward question: How are you going to explain to seniors that \nCongress stuck them with a Medicare plan that forces those seniors into \nHMOs? How are you going to explain to seniors that this plan will stick \nthem with a raw deal that raises premiums for those who do not want to \ngo into an HMO by $56 to $200 a month? What do you say to the 2 or 3 \nmillion seniors who are actually going to lose quality retiree \nprescription drug coverage under this bill and they are going to get \nsomething much worse?\n  We have to, in future years, add a real prescription drug benefit to \nMedicare in order to make seniors' lives better. By now accepting a \nphony drug benefit, Congress literally risks making it worse for those \nseniors.\n  How do you explain to seniors that Congress was not willing to let \nthem buy cheaper prescription drugs from Canada, but Congress was \nwilling to hand the pharmaceutical companies new windfall profits of \nmore than $139 billion?\n\n  How are you going to explain this bill could only be passed in the \nHouse under the cloak of darkness in the early morning hours, and only \nthen by\n\n[[Page S15611]]\n\nstretching the rules of the House beyond almost anything in history? \nAnd that the Senate then jammed through a 700-page bill with only 3 \ndays of debate, giving seniors very little chance to understand what is \ninvolved in the biggest and most dangerous change ever made to \nMedicare?\n  I ask those Senators who are planning to support this bill why they \nthink it is worthy to hold a prescription drug benefit hostage to a \nback-door deal to privatize Medicare, a deal that will help lobbyists, \nhelp powerful Washington interests and other interests around the \ncountry and help pharmaceutical companies but will literally make the \nlives of a lot of our seniors worse off than they are today?\n  Seniors need relief from inflated prescription drug prices, and they \nneed it now. Nearly 40 percent of Medicare beneficiaries report having \nno prescription drug coverage. Yet the average amount they have to pay \nout of their own pocket for prescription drugs is going to more than \ndouble between the years 2000 and 2006. It is on track to be $1,400 the \nyear this bill is scheduled to go into effect. If you deduct the amount \nof money given by this bill from the amount seniors will be paying on \naverage out of pocket, the benefit to most seniors in this country for \nbeing pushed into an HMO will not be worth the cost.\n  Congress ought to be demanding more. We ought to be demanding a real \ndeal for seniors, a Medicare bill that does what it says instead of \nthis phony bait-and-switch legislation. We ought to go back to the \ndrawing board and pass a real Medicare prescription drug benefit. This \nbill does more harm than it does good. Seniors are not guaranteed that \nthe price of their plan is not going to skyrocket. This bill prohibits \nthe Government from even negotiating discounts for Medicare \nprescription drugs. It prohibits the Government from doing that. It \ndenies the opportunity for seniors to import reasonable drugs from \nCanada and other industrialized countries. How extraordinary that the \nacolytes of free trade are closing down the ability of Americans to \nexercise free trade and import a product from another country at a \nlower price.\n  This bill is really about President Bush passing the buck on \nprescription drug coverage and passing the bucks from seniors to the \npharmaceutical industry. And this bill is being pushed through Congress \nwithout adequate debate and exposure to the public light, with too many \nbackroom deals, and with blatant contempt for the public interest.\n  The Republicans could not win a legitimate victory in the House, so \nthey held the vote open for an unprecedented 3 hours of special \ninterest lobbying, of almost $900 million of giveaways in exchange for \nvotes, so they could get enough people to switch over to their side.\n  President Bush twisted arms, twisted facts, until he finally managed \nto get the vote. Time and again, the President chooses to get cozy with \nthe lobbyists. We saw it on the Energy bill. We have read it in the \nnewspapers in the last weeks about who gained and who lost on any \nparticular debate each day in the debate over this bill. This \nadministration's motto ought to be: Leave no special interest behind. \nThis Medicare bill lays that record bare for all Americans to see.\n  The President goes around the country at a furious pace, fundraising \nat record levels. He has a group of insiders who provide his campaign \nwith a minimum of $100,000 of campaign cash. They have a name. They are \ncalled ``rangers'' and ``pioneers.'' Well, it should come as no \nsurprise to Americans, and particularly to seniors, that 24 ``rangers'' \nand ``pioneers'' are executives or lobbyists for the very companies \nthat will benefit from this Medicare bill, and they are getting a good \nreturn on their money.\n  This bill makes it easier for the big drug companies to gouge seniors \nand jack up health care costs so that top executives can walk away with \nmillions. I am all for people who work hard to make a living, and I \nwant people to be able to get rich in America. But when the drug \ncompanies' CEOs are making $40 million a year while the seniors they \nsell to are choosing between their medicine and their mortgage, I do \nnot consider that just plain old free enterprise; I consider that plain \nold greed.\n  This bill smooths the way for even higher drug company profits. In \nthe past 6 months, drug companies, HMOs, and other powerful industries \nhave spent $139 million in lobbying Congress to give them what they \nwant. Now they have gotten a bill that will give them an estimated $139 \nbillion over the next 8 years. A thousandfold return on an investment \nis not bad. You can say what you want about President Bush, but it is \nclear that his powerful campaign contributors got what they paid for. \nAnd it is easy to see why they make so much profit, given this bill, \nwhich does nothing to control the rising prices of prescription drugs, \nnothing to control the rising prices.\n  Without an effective means to restrain double-digit price increases, \nthis bill does nothing to protect seniors from ever-growing out-of-\npocket costs. Someone needs to explain why we are in such a rush to do \nthis. Is someone concerned that the more this cynical bill is exposed, \nthe less likely seniors will be to accept it? What harm would be done \nif the Nation took some time to look carefully at what is in this bill?\n  This plan does not kick in until 2006 anyway. So it is not as if \nseniors are going to get the relief they deserve at the stroke of a \nPresidential signing ceremony--no indeed. For the next 2 years, seniors \nare going to get a discount drug card to give them a 15-percent \ndiscount. Well, it does not take an act of Congress to do that. Ask any \nsenior today, and he or she will show you about three or five cards \nthey already carry in their wallets to get a discount on drugs.\n\n  Seniors deserve and expect more than a discount card with $400 \nbillion on the table. If we were really crafting a drug benefit and \nallowing the Government to institute cost-saving measures in order to \ntame out-of-control prices, we could deliver a benefit sooner than \n2006. The Government ought to be ready to do this within a matter of \nmonths.\n  The entire Medicare plan was set up in 11 months. Now that it is \nalready set up, in the age of computers, are we saying we could not \ndeliver a prescription drug benefit in a matter of months?\n  Why are we waiting until 2006? I will tell you why. It is for the \nprivate, for-profit companies that need to lure people into the market. \nAnd it is going to take them time to warm up to the plan. We are \nwaiting for 2006 for those companies.\n  This bill sets aside a $12 billion slush fund for the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services to entice private HMO-style plans to come \ninto the market in order to offer prescription drug plans to seniors. \nLarded up financial inducements are needed to attract these plans to \nthe market because the risk is so high.\n  Insuring seniors for drugs usually makes about as much sense as \ntrying to sell a homeowner's policy to someone whose house is burning \ndown. In other words, you are going to lose money. But in the name of \n``private competition,'' and to prevent the Federal Government from \nrunning this program, this is what they came up with: a great big \ncookie jar from which to dole out public dollars to private companies \nto get them to do what we could do less expensively and at less cost to \nseniors.\n  On top of giving them extra payments to participate, the bill does \nnothing to require that private plans actually operate efficiently. The \nMedicare Program, in its entirety, now spends only 2 percent of total \nexpenditures on administration. By contrast, many health plans in the \nprivate market often commit as much as 15 to 20 percent of their \nexpenditures to administration. So every dollar that goes to \nadministrative costs is a dollar not available to improve benefits for \nMedicare beneficiaries.\n  I think smart stewards of taxpayer dollars ought to demand that \nprivate plans be more efficient if they want to participate. Instead, \nthey are being rewarded from the slush fund and given advantages that \nonly their lobbying influence could get written into law.\n  In addition, this bill squanders another $6 billion on tax breaks for \nwealthy Americans that is going to harm Medicare. The legislation would \ncreate a tax-free, high-deductible catastrophic health policy known as \nhealth savings accounts. That account will undermine the traditional \nMedicare Program because it will result in cherry-picking. The \nhealthiest and the\n\n[[Page S15612]]\n\nwealthiest seniors will come out of the risk pool where they share the \nrisk of coverage, and that will result in raising the premiums for \neveryone else--for the poorer and the sicker--and it will raise those \npremiums by as much as 60 percent.\n  The so-called cost containment provisions in the bill add insult to \ninjury by essentially placing a cap on Medicare spending. This bill \nwould attempt to force future Congresses to reconcile Medicare spending \ngrowth by cutting benefits, raising premiums, or increasing the payroll \ntax. I believe that is unacceptable.\n  So what do America's seniors get from this bill?\n  More than 2 million seniors who have good drug coverage now, through \nretiree health plans, are going to lose it. About 6\\1/2\\ million low-\nincome seniors--the very people we need to help the most--could get \nless drug coverage than they have now. That is a raw deal for seniors.\n  Under this bill, 7 million seniors will be given this choice: Pay \nmore for Medicare and get forced into an HMO, give up on choosing your \nown doctor and hospital, or watch your bills skyrocket. That is the \nchoice for seniors.\n  The name of this provision in the bill is called premium support, but \nlike Clear Skies, which means dirtier air, or Healthy Forests, which \nmeans cutting down the trees, it is an innocent-sounding name for a \nplan that could raise Medicare premiums from about $60 to thousands of \ndollars. It breaks the compact of Medicare.\n  In fact, what it really means is the beginning of the end of Medicare \nas we know it. Those are not my words, those are the proud boasts of \nthe author of this bill, House Ways and Means chairman, Bill Thomas. He \nsaid:\n\n       To those who say that it would end Medicare as we know it, \n     our answer is, we certainly hope so.\n\n  It is not surprising that Newt Gingrich is supporting this deal \nbecause he long wanted Medicare to ``wither on the vine.'' Most \nAmericans and most Democrats have a different hope, that Medicare \nremain secure and strong. I intend to fight with everything I have to \nmake that happen.\n  We need a real-world, affordable Medicare prescription drug benefit \nfor seniors, a plan that won't force seniors into an HMO, that won't \nundermine the coverage for seniors who are already getting help today, \nthat will be run by Medicare instead of an insurance company in search \nof a buck, and that will send a real benefit to every senior, no matter \nwhether the costs are average or high. That is a real deal for \nAmerica's seniors. But as I said before, right now this bill is a bad \ndeal for seniors and they know it.\n  They know that this bill provides the skimpiest of benefits, with \nholes in coverage and complex rules. The coverage gaps remain too high, \nand seniors are still charged premiums even after their benefits shut \ndown in the so-called donut hole. I think we ought to go back to the \ndrawing board. They know this bill does not adequately protect them \nwith a guaranteed government fallback with a national premium. Until \nthis bill stops slanting all the advantages toward the HMOs and private \ncompanies, I believe we have to vote it down.\n  I believe seniors deserve a guaranteed Government fallback plan. \nSeniors know that this bill will jack up the out-of-pocket costs in \norder to visit doctors and hospitals. This is supposed to be a bill to \nadd a prescription drug benefit, but along the way beneficiaries got \nstuck holding the bill for an additional $25 billion in increased out-\nof-pocket costs from means testing the Part B premium and increasing \nthe deductible and indexing it to inflation.\n  This revenue raiser isn't done in order to improve Medicare but to \ngive sweet deals, slush funds, and tax accounts to corporations and to \nthe rich. It is wrong. We should vote it down.\n  I believe the proponents know that this bill fails to fix protections \nfor low-income seniors--certainly low-income seniors know that across \nthe country--and people with disabilities that currently rely on both \nMedicare and Medicaid for their coverage and should be defeated. They \nknow it and you know it. This is not a good deal for seniors.\n  This week in November of 1945, Harry Truman sent to Congress a \nproposal for health care for Americans. He said:\n\n       Millions of our citizens do not now have a full measure of \n     opportunity to achieve and to enjoy good health. And the time \n     has now arrived for action to help them attain that \n     opportunity and to help them get that protection.\n\n  But powerful interests mobilized 1945 on Capitol Hill and defeated \nhealth care for Americans, Harry Truman's proposal, and especially for \nour seniors.\n  It was almost 20 years later that a young American President took up \nHarry Truman's cause and called for health care for America's seniors. \nThis week in November of 1963, the House of Representatives was \nconsidering John Kennedy's Medicare proposal. The same powerful \ninterests were swarming through this building, but there was a spirit \nof hope and possibility. Now those who support this bill are \nbreaking the promise of Truman and Kennedy that was fulfilled under \nPresident Lyndon Johnson.\n\n  This has been tried before. This week in November of 1995, 30 years \nafter Medicare became law, Speaker Newt Gingrich and his ideological \nallies shut our Government down for the first time ever in order to \nachieve their radical objective of tearing down Medicare. Millions of \nseniors would have been harmed by those cuts, but we stood up and we \nstopped Newt Gingrich because President Bill Clinton and others stood \ntheir ground and defended Medicare.\n  I believe we need to stand our ground today and stand on principle \nagain. This bill will hurt seniors more than it will help them. We \nshould pass a bill that offers a real prescription drug benefit under \nMedicare. We need to rebuild Medicare, not sell it out to the highest \nbidders. Medicare is one of the best Federal programs we have. I don't \nbelieve it is time to shred it. It is time to strengthen it. This \nCongress and President Bush will be held accountable by America's \nseniors and American history for the decision we make now. I believe we \nought to give seniors a real deal, a prescription drug benefit under \nMedicare that works for them, and not a phony prescription drug benefit \nthat provides benefits only for the most powerful special interests \nthat stand in their way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grassley). The Chair recognizes the \nSenator from Missouri.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to speak \nabout this landmark piece of legislation that is so necessary and has \nbeen so necessary for too long and of which we have deprived America's \nseniors for too long. If I may say with great respect, I had a chance \nto listen to the last two speakers, my friend from Oklahoma and my \nfriend from Massachusetts. Listening to those speakers just summed up \nfor me why we have not passed this bill in the years and years it has \nbeen necessary and that seniors have been demanding it. The last two \nspeakers represented pretty well and eloquently, with their usual \nvigor, the opposite ends of the political spectrum on this bill.\n  For the first speaker, the bill represented too much government, too \nmuch money. For the second speaker, it represented too little \ngovernment, too little money. Both speakers are terribly disappointed \nwith President Bush. Both want more time to consider this bill and, if \nnecessary, go back to the drawing board; if necessary, wait years more \nbefore we provide a prescription drug benefit that millions of seniors \naround the country need and have needed for many years.\n  I rise to speak in favor of the bipartisan Medicare conference \nagreement. I think it is necessary. Medicare is a great program. My dad \npassed away last October. He was 91 years old. My mom had passed away \nabout 15 years before then in her early seventies. They both used \nMedicare and stayed alive as long as they did and as healthy and as \nhappy as long as they did in part because of Medicare. It has covered \ntens and tens of millions of seniors, not only with good medical care \nbut with the security of knowing that they had medical care if they got \nsick.\n  Medicare was a great program and is a great program in 1965 terms. \nThat is when it was developed. It covers the kinds of things that good \nhealth care covered in 1965, and it doesn't cover the kinds of things \nthat were not covered in 1965. It doesn't have very many preventive \nhealth care benefits, catastrophic coverage for long-term acute\n\n[[Page S15613]]\n\nillnesses. And it does not have coverage for outpatient prescription \ndrugs because in 1965 you didn't use prescription drugs very often, \nunless you had an infection or some kind of pain killer. Now they are a \npart of almost every ongoing medical care treatment plan. Everybody who \nhas health insurance--and not enough do--just about everybody who does \nhas some kind of prescription drug coverage because it helps keep you \nhealthy.\n  In providing insurance to somebody, you want them to stay healthy \nbecause if they get sick, it ends up costing more money for everybody. \nThat is the reason we haven't had this coverage in Medicare, and it has \nhurt people.\n  There was a parade I used to be in every year when I was in the \nHouse. I like parades. You get a lot of exercise, and they are fun. It \nis in Hazelwood, MO. I would go down the same street. I always walk \nparades. I remember running up this driveway and these two seniors \nwould be sitting at the top of their driveway watching the parade every \nyear. Every year I would stop there for 60 seconds, and they would ask \nme when we were going to cover prescription drugs in Medicare.\n  I would say: Well, we haven't done it yet.\n  And they would say: We know that.\n  Then the issue finally moved on the front burner here at the end of \nlate 1990s and the House began passing bills, 3 or 4 years in a row. We \nnever passed one until this year here. The sentiments we have heard \ntoday--I respect so much the Senators who uttered them--are the reasons \nwhy.\n  I just do not want to wait until we get a bill that satisfies every \nextreme in politics and the political exigencies for everybody because \nwe will wait forever. We will never get a bill then. I would rather go \nahead with this bill, which is a good bill, and take what is good about \nit and then see what is working and what isn't working and then go back \nand fix it.\n  That is the reason the AARP supports this. They are tired of waiting, \ntoo. I had a hearing on this. I have the honor of sitting on the \nSpecial Committee on Aging, a great committee, with a great chairman, \nSenator Larry Craig. The hearing was in St. Louis. One of the witnesses \nwas Audrey Vallely, a delightful lady, who attended the Route 66 Senior \nCenter in Eureka, MO, regularly. I have been out there for lunch a \ncouple of times. She testified about her experiences over the last 12 \nyears. Audrey suffers from osteoarthritis, a degenerative bone disease, \nand she also has a sinus disease. She ought to be taking two different \ntypes of prescription drugs for these conditions, but it costs $100 a \nmonth for 15 pills. So she often cannot take the drugs. She gets some \npain relief over-the-counter pills; sometimes it makes her feel better \nand sometimes it doesn't. She does the best she can. She has to choose \nbetween paying for those drugs or paying her rent. Having an air \nconditioner working in the summer is hard for her. All of these \nstatements about the problems in this bill mean nothing to Audrey, who \nstruggles month after month because of this gap in Medicare.\n  What would the bipartisan agreement mean for Missouri? We have over \n888,000 beneficiaries in Missouri. They all have the opportunity to get \na discount card--a 15- to 25-percent discount immediately. Better than \nthat, low-income seniors get, in addition to that, $600 a month in \nannual assistance to help them afford their medicines, along with \ndiscount cards. That is a total of over $200 million in assistance for \nover 170,000 Missouri residents over the next 2 years, if we pass this \nbill--not otherwise.\n  Beginning in 2006, every Missouri senior in Missouri would be \neligible for coverage in this bill for approximately $35 a month. They \nget at least 50 percent off--or approximately 50 percent off their \nprescription drug costs. Of the approximately 270,000 beneficiaries in \nMissouri who have limited savings and low income, they will qualify for \neven more generous coverage. Additionally, the Government will help the \nState pick up the cost of the Medicaid-eligible seniors. That will help \nMissouri, which is in a cash-strapped situation with regard to its \nbudget.\n  This bill meets the conditions that I thought was important for a \nMedicare prescription drug bill. It has an immediate benefit, \nreasonable monthly premiums, strong catastrophic coverage, targeted \nhelp for low-income seniors, quality benefits for rural areas, \nprotections for local pharmacies, choice and access to all medicine, \nand participation in it is voluntary. If you like what you have, you \ndon't have to participate.\n  That is the reason I am supporting this. I will be pleased to vote \nfor it on final passage. I hope a majority of the Senate does. I hope \nwe are allowed to vote. You never know these days. This is the most \nimportant Medicare bill in a generation and maybe we will be able to \nvote on it and maybe we will not. I know most of the people want to \nhave an opportunity to vote on this bill. I think most will vote for it \nif they get that opportunity.\n  I am going to close by saying what I have said on the fairly rare \noccasions when I have spoken on this issue on the Senate floor. In this \nbody, everything always gets said but not everybody says it. Once in a \nwhile, I feel maybe I should deprive the Senate of my comments on \nsomething in the service of expedition. But I have said, look, if the \nbill is reasonable, I am going to move ahead with it. I am tired of \nwaiting. I would like to help these people, such as the folks I saw in \nthat parade, and like Audrey Vallely, and others, get access to \nprescription drugs. I think most of the people who have worked on this \non both sides have done their best. As far as I can tell, they are not \nmotivated by all the lobbyists or the special interests. I have been in \na lot of meetings on this, and that hasn't come up once. They are \ntrying to do the best they can for seniors, in a way that will work and \nbe affordable for everybody. That is what this bill does. I am going to \nvote for it on that basis. I hope it passes.\n  I congratulate the chairman, who is presiding now, for his fine work.\n  How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 21 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. TALENT. I am pleased to yield that time to my friend from \nColorado.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized for 21 \nminutes.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding the \nbalance of his time.\n  Mr. President, first I want to compliment Majority Leader Bill Frist, \nfrom Tennessee; Chairman of the Finance Committee, Chuck Grassley; and \nthe Conference Committee on working diligently and in good faith toward \na workable prescription drug program for elderly citizens. Some have \ncome to this floor and proclaimed it is about politics. I couldn't \ndisagree more. President George Bush, Majority Leader Bill Frist, and \nChairman Grassley have not only talked about the need for a \nprescription drug program but have worked hard for several years toward \na workable program.\n  It is the Democrats who have demagoged this issue. We just have to \nlook at last year when the prescription bill was brought to the floor \nby the Democrat majority leader, without having it debated and reported \nout of committee. I believe that it was their hope that they could \nembarrass Republicans in an election year. Instead, it only helped \npoint to the failures of a Democrat-led Senate that couldn't even pass \na budget because they did not want to deal with the tough votes they \nwould have to face on this floor.\n  I believe this Republican-led Senate is wrapping up one of the most \nsuccessful sessions since 1994. There have been long hours and a lot of \nhard work that has paid off, despite filibusters on judges and attempts \nto slow down and kill many provisions, such as the budget. But \nRepublicans passed a budget. Republicans are still working hard to pass \nan energy bill that was blocked through the efforts of key Democrats, \nand the Republicans are now working hard to pass a description drug \nbenefit that is facing a possible filibuster on the Senate floor by the \nDemocrats.\n  Mr. President, I am very disappointed that we have had to face all \nthis obstruction on the floor, despite the concerted effort to work \nresponsibly and respectively through the Senate committee system, then \nbringing the prescription drug bill to the floor and passing it. Now, \nhere we are again, facing a threatened filibuster by the Democrats. Mr. \nPresident, we need to have an up or down vote on this conference \nreport. Again, I know that the conferees worked hard in a bipartisan \nway.\n\n[[Page S15614]]\n\n  I plan on voting for cloture because I want to see the conference \nreport on Medicare voted on the floor of the Senate. I have stated that \nI am undecided on final passage. That is because, as a general rule, in \nthe process of negotiations, legislation doesn't get less expensive, it \ngets more expensive through spending to attract more support and votes. \nI hope to act as a counterbalance with the clear message that, if \nspending gets out of hand, I will not vote for the bill.\n  I am not happy with creating a new program that could lead to a \nmonstrous program in the future. That is why I opposed the bill as it \nleft the Senate, because it was not limited to just the most needy and \nI felt it broke the budget. It was later proved that I was right in the \nassessment that it would break the budget, and with more accurate \nbudget figures the conference committee set to work to reduce the scope \nof the program to keep it below $400 billion for 10 years and within \nthe parameters of the budget. This, in effect, forced the conference \ncommittee to means test the program and keep certain provisions that \nwould hold the user accountable by forcing that patient to participate \nwith a deductible and the so called ``donut hole.''\n  In my view, it is very difficult to have a third party pay system and \nyet maintain accountability. Users feel that they have already paid for \nthe system and are going to utilize it to its maximum to get their just \nreturn, and providers feel that it has already been paid for and \ncreates no particular hardship on the individual so they charge with \nlittle restraint the third party. So utilization is regulated. And we \nend up with regulations like we have now in the current Medicare \nsystem, which prevents a patient from paying for their own medical care \nif they want, and it prevents the physician from receiving cash outside \nthe system that could reduce the burden on taxpayers. It ends up \ncreating a system where the close patient-doctor relationship is \ndisrupted to where the patient can't use whomever they desire to care \nfor their medical needs. So what we have today is a Medicare system \nthat is not actuarially sound and, if not reformed, will lead to much \nhigher payroll taxes and huge demands on the general budget. That is \nwhy I was pleased to see some reform proposals on medicare emerge from \nthe conference committee, such as health saving accounts.\n  When I served in the Colorado State Senate, I sponsored, with State \nRepresentative Phil Pankey, a bill to put in place an individual \nmedical saving account; and Colorado became the first State to have \nsuch a program.\n  Unfortunately, in an effort to pass the bill, we allowed the program \nto become so limited that the risk pool became too small to function as \ninsurance against future liabilities. Consequently, when Colorado moved \nto a modified flat tax, this program became a victim of tax reform.\n  This Congress puts forth a health savings account that will work. \nIndividuals can put in $5,000 a year or a family can put up to $10,000 \nper year and save on their taxes. The income builds up within the \nhealth savings fund without tax liability and, finally, can be pulled \nout to pay for the family medical needs without paying additional \ntaxes.\n  This is wonderful reform because it reestablishes the doctor-patient \nrelationship and makes individuals responsible for their own health \ncare with much fewer regulations, and it brings common sense to the \ndecisionmaking process. It builds upon previously enacted medical \nsavings accounts that have been limited to small business and the self-\nemployed by Congress.\n  One other attractive feature in this bill is that the elderly are not \nforced to participate. It is voluntary. It also tries to prevent large \nbusinesses and local governments from dumping their current \nprescription programs into the Federal system to save themselves future \nliabilities and further burden the Federal prescription drug program.\n  The other side has repeatedly made the claim that this bill is full \nof giveaways to Republican contributors. This is simply not true. That \nis simply more absurd ``medi-scare'' tactics by the opponents of a \nbipartisan drug benefit for our Nation's seniors and the disabled.\n  The argument I find most amusing is the claim that this bill will \nlead to increased drug company profits. The reason this bill is so \ndesperately needed is because our Nation's seniors and the disabled, \nparticularly those with low incomes, are unable to afford their \nprescriptions today. Let me stress that again. The reason this bill is \nso desperately needed is that our Nation's seniors and the disabled, \nparticularly those with lower income, are unable--unable--to afford \ntheir prescriptions today. Today they are forced to choose between food \nand rent and taking their medicine. We have all heard the stories of \nseniors cutting their pills in half to get by and in so doing taking a \nlower dose than their doctor prescribed.\n  When this Medicare prescription drug benefit goes into effect, they \nwill be able to get their prescriptions filled. Of course, this is \ngoing to lead to increased drug sales. Surely, this is no surprise to \nanyone. With new technologies and new medications, invasive procedures \nbecome less likely. Any prescription drug bill that works is going to \nlead to increased drug sales. That is just common sense.\n  Where are the medicines supposed to come from except the \nmanufacturers of those medicines? Every single medical prescription \ndrug bill introduced by these naysayers would also increase drug sales \nand the bipartisan conference report has the same basic drug benefit \nstructure that passed the Senate by a vote of 76 to 21.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has concluded that the competitive \napproach in this bipartisan drug benefit will do better at controlling \ndrug costs than other proposals. To suggest that no one should support \na Medicare drug benefit because it will lead to increased drug sales \nturns logic on its head. If this were our basic principle, then we \nshould not have food stamps because this will lead to increased profits \nby grocery stores and farmers. How about housing subsidies? This might \nlead to profits by construction companies and utility companies and \nincreased sales of lumber, bricks, and nails. This is just an absurd \nissue, and it is easy to see why.\n  I am here to tell you that this bill will strengthen and improve the \nMedicare Program. The spending on this bipartisan prescription drug \nbill goes to better benefits for America's seniors and the disabled.\n  As I draw to a conclusion, unfortunately, those who want universal \nhealth care and the big Government solution to drugs, making people \nmore vulnerable to Government control, are vehemently opposed to this \nconference report.\n  The conference report lays out a plan for Medicare reform and a way \nto help the most needy. It is a balance that does not come easily and \nnot without a lot of discussion on both sides of the aisle. We should \nat least have a vote on the bill. It is time to put partisan \nobstruction aside and think about what is good for America.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in voting yes on cloture to stop the \nfilibuster and to help hold down costs to within the budget limits.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Talent). The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, as Congress considers Medicare and \nprescription drugs, I keep remembering the older people whose stories \nspurred me to choose a career in public service. For 7 years, before I \ncame to the Congress, I worked with seniors and spent many hours \nvisiting with them in their homes. During those visits, seniors would \noften bring out shoeboxes full of health insurance policies that were \nsupposed to fill the gaps in their Medicare. It was common for a senior \nthen to have seven or eight of these policies, and many of them were \nnot worth the paper they were written on. Slick, fast-talking insurance \nhucksters kept coming around and scaring the older folks, and it was \nheartbreaking to see seniors ripped off this way.\n  After working all their lives, seniors would go without each month \nbecause they were paying for junk health insurance policies with the \nprecious funds they needed to pay the heating bill or buy some \ngroceries.\n  When I got elected to the Congress, I vowed to stop this fleecing of \nAmerica's seniors. I helped to write the first and only tough law to \nstop the ripoffs of private health insurance sold to the elderly. This \nstatute has worked to drain the swamp of fly-by-night Medigap policies \nthat used to rob seniors blind.\n\n[[Page S15615]]\n\n  The days of the shoebox full of health insurance policies are gone, \nbut the skyrocketing drug costs and lack of access to medicine--two of \nthe problems that plagued seniors even back then--are more of a problem \ntoday.\n  During those home visits I made with seniors, I saw firsthand the \npain they felt when they couldn't afford lifesaving medicine. Their \nanguish was physical, and it was emotional. They feared for their \nfutures. They worried that the choices that financial constraints \nforced on them would not be the right ones.\n  We are very familiar with those stories today. Caseworkers in every \noffice in the Senate hear them constantly. A senior is supposed to take \nfour pills, but because they can't make ends meet, they take three or \ntwo. Eventually, that senior ends up in the hospital where the hospital \nportion of Medicare, known as Part A, covers drug treatment, but often \nit is too late.\n  I have tried to rewrite stories such as that since I came to the \nCongress. That is why I worked with Senator Pryor's father so that \nStates could bargain aggressively and get more for their Medicaid \ndollar when buying prescription drugs that would help the low-income \nelderly. I have tried to expand coverage for generic drugs. I have \nworked to supplement those efforts by creating new health care options \nfor seniors, including in-home care and increased payments for \nproviders in low-cost areas, funds that can be used to offer \nprescription drug benefits to some of the elderly. Because of my \nhistory, I am acutely aware that there is so much more to do. The \nreason the debate on this bill is so important is that Government has \nthe obligation to do right by a generation that deserves our respect \nand care and not give those seniors the runaround.\n\n  My years working with the older people have governed the decision I \nhave made on this bill. I have tried to keep the focus on determining \nwhether this prescription drug benefit legislation would make a genuine \npositive difference for a significant number of older people or whether \nit falls short of that objective.\n  As part of the process, I have developed a set of criteria to \nevaluate this legislation. I would like to describe the questions I \nbelieved were key and the answers I have found.\n  The first question I asked was: Does this bill help a significant \nnumber of older people with low incomes or big prescription drug bills? \nIn their editorial endorsing this legislation, the New York Times \nstated:\n\n       The bill is strongest when it comes to the most important \n     target groups: Elderly people with low incomes or very high \n     drug bills.\n\n  It is not my job to take the word of editorial writers simply because \nthey are just one voice in a chorus that comes from both sides. So I \nhave gone to some length to examine the figures and data from all \nperspectives. I looked at the data that has been available from those \nstrongly in favor of the legislation, such as the Federal Center for \nMedicare and Medicaid Services. I looked at the information from those \nstrongly opposed to the bill, such as the nonprofit Center on Budget \nand Policy Priorities.\n  The critics say the legislation has significant gaps in coverage for \nseniors, especially those of modest income. Proponents of the bill \nclaim that millions of seniors will have coverage they did not have \nbefore. There does seem to be truth on both counts. So I have tried to \nkeep the focus on figures that were beyond any doubt. Using data from \nthe 2000 Oregon census, my staff and I have determined that 78,829 \nolder people in Oregon had prescription costs that exceeded $5,000, and \nunder this bill these seniors would have their prescription drug costs \nreduced by one-half.\n  Using 2001 data from the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation, my staff \ndetermined that Oregon has 106,765 seniors on Medicare with incomes at \nor below $12,123 for an individual or $16,362 for a couple.\n  Under this legislation, this low-income group would pay no premium \nfor their drug coverage and would be responsible for a copay of no more \nthan $2 for generic drugs and no more than $5 for brand name drugs. The \nleast fortunate would pay only $1 for generics and $3 for brand name \ndrugs.\n  Most seniors with low incomes and high drug costs are likely to be \neligible for both Medicaid and Medicare. These older people are known \nas dual eligibles. This legislation assures that they receive at least \nsome measure of prescription drug coverage through Medicare so they are \nnot left at the mercy of perennial State budget crises and so they will \nnot have to compete against other vulnerable groups in State budget \nbattles.\n  Another factor I considered was the expectations for this \nlegislation. What I hear from seniors at senior centers and at meal \nsites is that expectations are very high. I know some seniors will find \nthat this bill does not offer benefits that match their expectations. \nSome seniors fear this bill is going to fence them in and require that \nthey participate in a program they do not support. So at the very \nleast, because this program is voluntary, it strikes me as a plus that \nno senior will be forced to accept the terms of this legislation.\n  So on this particular issue, with respect to who benefits, what we \nfound that seniors in my State with very high drug bills would have \ntheir costs reduced by half. We found a great many low-income people \nwho would receive very significant benefits with no premium and a very \nmodest copay for their drugs.\n  The second question we asked was: How does this bill affect seniors \nwho currently get their prescription drug coverage through corporate \nretiree benefit packages? Almost every day now we pick up a newspaper \nand read about another employer dropping their retiree benefits or \ncutting them back significantly. There has been a dramatic reduction in \ncorporate retiree health benefits, and it is taking place right now \nbefore the enactment or rejection of any legislation.\n\n  The percentage of large employers offering retiree health benefits \nover a relatively short period of time has dropped from 66 percent to \n34 percent. Consistently, the employers who keep coverage have required \nthe retirees to shell out for higher copayments and premiums. Employers \nsay they have to make these cuts because of the rising costs of health \ncare and the effects of a lousy economy. Now along comes the Congress \nwith a bill that many believe will dramatically affect retiree plans in \nthe future.\n  It seems to me that with legislation offering $71 billion to \nemployers to keep their coverage, these funds can only be a plus in \ndeveloping a strategy for getting more employers to retain existing \ncoverage. This is a subsidy the companies are not going to see absent \nthis legislation.\n  So I ask the Senate: Will companies not be less likely, not more \nlikely, to drop coverage if they get the funds offered tax free under \nthis legislation?\n  I would also note that corporate retiree provisions in the conference \nreport are better than the provisions in the original Senate bill which \nwas approved by more than 75 members of this body.\n  Bernstein Research says employers spend about $1,900 per year per \nsenior on retiree drug benefits. Based on my calculations, this bill \ngives corporations a significant tax-free incentive to cover not only \nretiree drug benefits but other senior health care costs as well.\n  The next question I asked was: Does this bill significantly undermine \ntraditional Medicare? Critics of the bill have focused on this issue, \nand I share their view that seniors believe in Medicare, want to \nmodernize it, and do not want it undermined.\n  The critics seem to believe that any effort, however, to create more \nchoices outside the basic Medicare fee-for-service program is a \nmistake. I disagree. I believe seniors need good quality choices beyond \nfee for service. I simply believe those choices must be accompanied by \nstrong consumer protections and that it is essential to strike a \nbalance, making sure that the new choices never, ever cut off access to \ntraditional Medicare that seniors know so well and a program with which \nthey feel so comfortable.\n  I have never been opposed to private sector involvement with \nMedicare. In many Oregon communities, upwards of 40 percent of the \nelderly get their Medicare through private plans. The law I wrote \nstopped the rip-offs of private health supplements to Medicare, \nstandardized 10 private sector policies to help seniors fill the holes \nin Medicare, and consumer advocates across the country believe that law \nis working.\n\n[[Page S15616]]\n\n  The key to making the private sector choices work is a combination of \nstrong consumer protections and a level playing field between the \nprivate sector choices and health services offered by the Government. I \nhave considerable ambivalence about how this legislation will affect \nthat balance.\n  In the bipartisan prescription drug legislation I drafted with \nSenator Snowe, we offered private sector options for seniors that \ncontain strong consumer safeguards. Our bill was known as SPICE, the \nSenior Prescription Insurance Coverage Equity Act. It did not tilt the \nplaying field toward the private sector the way the legislation before \nCongress does today with its health savings accounts and premium \nsupport. Unfortunately, the health savings accounts in this bill, which \nare tax breaks for purchasing health care, are structured to \ndisproportionately benefit the healthy and the wealthy. Seven billion \ndollars of tax subsidies are directed to these accounts. This has gone \nfrom a demonstration project to a major expense, one that siphons away \nfunds that could go to beef up the drug benefits.\n\n  Another drawback of the legislation is the premium support \nprovisions, which are designed to test competition between traditional \nMedicare and private plans. These could drive seniors out of the fee-\nfor-service programs they want. Premium support demonstrations could \nallow insurance companies to cherry-pick the healthy seniors, leaving \nthe truly ill to go to poorly funded Government programs that are \nsicker than they are. Even though premium support doesn't start until \n2010, I don't believe it has a responsible role to play in this \nlegislation.\n  I don't believe this legislation is going to wipe out traditional \nMedicare. I do believe that Congress is going to have to be \nextraordinarily vigilant with respect to ensuring that traditional \nMedicare can coexist and prosper along with the new choices. Without \ncareful management, it is certainly possible that health savings \naccounts and premium support could tilt the Medicare Program away from \nproviding traditional fee for service for all the seniors who want it. \nIf this legislation passes, it will be the job of the Congress to make \nsure that does not happen.\n  The next question I asked is especially important. Virtually every \nsenior in America wants to know: What will this legislation do to keep \ntheir prescription drug bills down? In my mind, the key to effective \ncontaining of prescription costs is to make sure older people have \nbargaining power in the health care marketplace. Today, when a senior \ngets his or her prescriptions through a health plan with many members, \nthat plan has significantly more bargaining power than that same senior \nwould have by walking into a Walgreen's, a Safeway, or a Fred Meyer to \nbuy medicine. Getting seniors more purchasing power by getting them \ninto large buying groups is an absolute prerequisite for a long-term \nstrategy for keeping prescription costs down for older people.\n  That was the principle behind the Medicaid drug rebate law that I \nhelped author with the first Senator Pryor. That is the principle that \nSenator Snowe and I have proposed in our bipartisan legislation. We \nlooked to a market-based proposal that was built around the Federal \nEmployees Health Benefits Plan, a program that has been proven to \ncontain costs because of the sheer size of the group of Federal \nemployees for which it bargains.\n  I think it is very unfortunate that this legislation did not put in \nplace a model like the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan to \ncontain costs. But I think it has to be noted that some baby steps in \nthe right direction have been taken with respect to cost containment. \nThe bill begins to leverage the potential bargaining power of 30 \nmillion seniors by giving older people the opportunity to join large \nmanaged care plans and big fee-for-service plans that can use their \nsheer numbers to negotiate discounts for older people on their \nmedicine. The bill also removes some of the barriers to getting cheaper \ngenerics to market faster.\n  It also recognizes that there is great value in comparing the \neffectiveness of similar drugs so seniors, providers, and the \nGovernment can spend funds on the best medicines at the lowest cost. \nThis is very much in keeping with the way my own State has approached \ncost containment.\n  I do wish this bill went further on cost containment. There should be \na way to bargain for even bigger segments of the elderly, not just the \nfractions of the population who end up in HMOs or various private \nhealth plans.\n  I am concerned that while private plans have the power to bargain \nunder this bill, the Medicare Program is barred from giving seniors the \nkind of bargaining power that Senator Snowe and I wanted them to have \nin our model that looked to the Federal employee program for seniors.\n  I am also concerned that there is not ongoing monitoring to assure \nthat drug prices are not increased unfairly before the bill takes \neffect, or in the first few months after it does.\n  So the legislation does not contain costs the way Senator Snowe and I \nwould have liked. It does take some modest steps in the right \ndirection. It borrows from the principles of our legislation, but in \nthe end I strongly believe that more and better cost containment \nmeasures with respect to prescriptions are going to be needed in the \nfuture.\n\n  Next, I asked: Does this legislation address Medicare's broader \nchallenges, including the large number of retirees that will join in \nthe near future? A demographic tsunami is about to occur in our \ncountry. As the baby boomers come of age, there are going to be \nextraordinary pressures on our health care system. Health care advances \nmean that seniors will live longer, and many of those advances will \ncome in pill form. What is exciting is that the more researchers learn \nabout the way medicines affect individuals, the more personalized \ntreatments, emphasizing pharmaceuticals, will become. Drugs that work \none way for Bob will work differently for Mary. In the years ahead, I \nbelieve a new field known as ``personalized medicine through \npharmaceuticals'' is going to help to increase the quality of patient \ncare and cut down on wasteful spending.\n  As of now, however, baby boomers face the prospect of joining a \nMedicare Program that is already short of funds. That is why the $400 \nbillion authorized in this legislation is a lifeline for the baby \nboomers who are going to retire in just a few years. Those funds \nprovide some measure of security for future retirees, and some tangible \nevidence that Congress is laying the groundwork to support the growing \nMedicare population which will need both prescription drugs and the \nbroader program.\n  There are several modest benefits in this bill, in addition, that \nsounds exciting to me for Medicare's future. One would focus on an \napproach known as disease management. This is going to be attractive in \nthe years ahead because it will allow many of our country's future \nseniors to have better, more cost-effective care for chronic \nconditions. Medicare has lacked this benefit.\n  In addition to these direct benefits for seniors, the legislation \nhelps gear up Medicare for the baby boomers with significant increases \nto many deserving health care providers. Over 10 years, hospitals in my \nState will receive almost $95 million. I am especially pleased that a \nnumber of medical providers, a number of our hospitals that now see a \nsmall number of patients and those that have a large share of patients \nwho are too poor to pay for their care, would get help.\n  In addition, doctors across the country who are expecting decreases \nin Medicare reimbursements in 2004 and 2005 would find this reduction \nblocked in this legislation. In fact, the legislation increases \nMedicare provider payments in both of the years where otherwise there \nwould be cutbacks. This is important because Government cost shifts \nhave already cut reimbursement to doctors, many of whom have large \nnumbers of low-income patients, to record lows.\n  I would also note that these benefits to providers will be especially \nuseful in rural areas where we have the nationwide crisis with respect \nto declining access as a result of providers simply not being able to \nstay in business.\n  Finally, I ask one last question that looked beyond the issue of \nprescription drugs. I asked: Is there any way this legislation could \nprovide a path to a health care system that works, not just for older \npeople, but for all Americans?\n\n[[Page S15617]]\n\nThere is a provision in this bill that offers health care hope, not \njust to seniors, but for all Americans. It is a provision that I helped \nto write with Senator Hatch, based on our Health Care that Works for \nAll Americans Act. This legislation would ensure that, for the very \nfirst time, the American people would be involved in the process of \ncomprehensive health care reform. There would be a blueprint for making \nhealth care more accessible and more affordable, not just to seniors, \nbut for all Americans.\n  Senator Hatch and I have been able to convince those on the Medicare \nconference committee that the key is to make sure that the public \nunderstands what the real choices are with respect to health care, how \nthe health care dollar is used today, and how it might be used in the \nfuture.\n  In 1993, then-President Clinton announced his intention to create a \nhealth care system that worked for all Americans. But by the time that \n1,390-page bill was written with no input from the public, sent to the \nCongress, and torn apart on the airwaves by special interest groups, \nthe people couldn't distinguish the truth from the special interest \nspin, and the effort died. Without public support, the opportunity for \nchange was lost.\n  The bipartisan leadership of the Senate at that time has told Senator \nHatch and I that, had our bill been in effect in 1993, our country \nwould be well on its way to implementing a system that ensured coverage \nfor all our citizens. So I think it is of additional benefit that this \nlegislation gives us a chance to restart the debate that died in 1994. \nOur legislation creates a Citizens Health Care Working Group that would \ntake steps, through on-line opportunities, townhall meetings and other \nforms, to involve the public; and then there is a requirement, after \nthat public involvement, that the Congress follow up on the views that \ncome from the citizens' participation.\n  There are tough calls to be made in today's health care system, \nincluding in the Medicare Program. But it is time to make them \ntogether. I think if one lesson has been learned in the last few months \nof discussion about prescription drugs, it is that health care is like \nan ecosystem. When you make changes in one area, such as prescription \ndrugs, it can affect many other areas, such as corporate retiree \nbenefits, provider payments, and various other parts of the health care \nsystem.\n  The legislation Senator Hatch and I have put together and which is \nincluded in this conference report treats health care as an entire and \na systemwide concern for the American people. Nothing is taken off the \ntable. I believe there is in that legislation a path to making sure \nthis Congress helps not just older people but sets out ways to ensure \nthat all Americans have access to good quality and affordable health \ncare.\n  Finally, let me note that collegiality hasn't exactly been one of the \nwatchwords of the debate over this legislation. There have been some \nvery cold considerations entering into this discussion. I know that \nsome believe passage of this legislation will hand the President a \ngreat victory. Others on the other side of the aisle say Democrats who \noppose this bill shouldn't dare raise questions. Those aren't the \nconcerns that ought to drive the debate on Medicare at a time when the \ncountry has to get ready for a demographic phenomenon. Polarization and \ndivision do not do our country any good.\n  This legislation is a very tough call for me and I think for many \nothers.\n  Congress could make a mistake by believing the $400 billion available \nin this legislation will still be there in February of 2005. As a \nmember of the Budget Committee, I know how hard it has been to get \nfunding for this benefit. When Senator Snowe and I began in 1999 to \nwork for funding for a drug benefit, the Senate thought we lassoed the \nMoon when we successfully got $40 billion in the budget. How then can \nyou argue that Congress should walk away from $400 billion?\n  I wish there were a better bill. I wish it didn't include medical \nsavings accounts and premium support and had done better in the area of \ncost containment.\n  There are going to be various procedural considerations that may come \nout, and I intend to weigh each of them before I vote on those \nprocedural concerns. If it finally becomes clear that the bill, as is, \nrepresents the Senate's sole opportunity to inject $400 billion in \nlong-sought prescription drug benefits in Medicare, I will vote yes.\n  At the end of the day, I will not vote to let the last train that \nleaves the Senate go out without $400 billion that can be used to help \nvulnerable seniors and those who are getting crushed by prescription \ndrug costs. I will continue to fight to make this legislation better \nand for better health care for all Americans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the opponents of this bipartisan \nMedicare bill have made the claim that 6 million seniors are hurt by \nthis bill. The other side has also claimed that 25 percent of seniors \nwill be forced to pay more for their prescription drugs under this \nbill.\n  I want to be very clear that this is not accurate at all. I'm here to \ntell the American public the truth.\n  The truth is that 14 million lower income seniors and disabled \nAmericans are benefited greatly by this bipartisan bill. These 14 \nmillion people will get very generous prescription drug coverage \nthrough Medicare in this bill.\n  First, as you can see on this chart, 7.8 million seniors and disabled \nAmericans get full coverage with no deductible, no gap in coverage, and \nwould pay only $2 for generic drugs and only $5 for brand name drugs. \nAnd if these seniors reach the catastrophic coverage limit, then they \nwill get their prescriptions fully covered with no copays. That's \nright, no copays at all.\n  Next, as you can see on the chart, an additional 4.4 million lower \nincome seniors will get even more generous coverage. These Seniors will \npay only $1 for generic drugs and only $3 for brand name drugs. And if \nthese seniors reach the catastrophic coverage limit, then they too will \nget their prescriptions fully covered with no copays.\n  In addition, some of these people are enrolled in both Medicare and \nMedicaid and are living in a nursing home--about 1.3 million of them. \nThis bipartisan bill creates a special benefit for these people. For \nthem, Medicare will cover 100 percent of the prescription costs. They \npay nothing.\n  These groups of seniors in total represent 12.2 million seniors and \ndisabled Americans.\n  The bill also provides coverage to about 2 million more lower income \nseniors and disabled Americans. These seniors have 85 percent of their \ndrug costs covered after meeting a $50 deductible, and if they hit the \ncatastrophic coverage limit, they would pay only $2 for generic drugs \nand $5 for brand-name drugs.\n  This is full coverage with no coverage gap and 85-98 percent of drug \ncosts covered for about 14 million seniors and disabled Americans. That \nis about 36 percent of all Medicare beneficiaries.\n  That is what this bill does. It provides very generous prescription \ndrug coverage through the Medicare program for about 14 million lower \nincome seniors and disabled Americans. And it provides this full \ncoverage to 8 million lower income seniors who have no coverage at all \ntoday.\n  On top of that, of course, this bill provides all beneficiaries with \naccess to basic prescription drug coverage with protections against \ncatastrophic drug costs. The average beneficiary who does not quality \nfor the low income benefits I have just described will still have about \nhalf of their drug costs covered under this bill.\n  Finally, no one is forced into this drug benefit. It is a purely \nvoluntary benefit. No one is forced to enroll and any senior or \ndisabled American that does not see the drug coverage offered as a good \ndeal for them does not have to enroll.\n  So this bipartisan bill before us does not harm seniors. That is an \nabsurd charge to make by the opponents of this bill.\n  This bill provides an affordable, voluntary and universal drug \nbenefit for all seniors and disabled Americans in this country. And it \nprovides very generous coverage to those 14 million lower income \nbeneficiaries.\n  It is time to put the partisan rhetoric aside and approve this \nbipartisan bill that the AARP calls ``an historic breakthrough and [an] \nimportant milestone in the nation's commitment to strengthen and expand \nhealth security for its citizens.\n\n[[Page S15618]]\n\n  I yield the remainder of this half hour to Senator Domenici.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). The Senator from New Mexico is \nrecognized. He has 23 minute 20 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today I rise in support of the Medicare \nPrescription Drug and Modernization Act. I thank the Senate and the \nHouse conferees, as well as the leadership of both bodies, for their \nwork over the past few months. Their perseverance has paid off. This \nbill represents a major step forward for this body on behalf of the \nseniors of this country.\n  Experts and fair-minded people have known for many years that the \nMedicare Program must be reformed. For more than 6 years, Republicans \nhave led efforts to overhaul the Medicare system and ensure American \nseniors continue to have access to high-quality, comprehensive health \ncare in the future. First, a little history. The Budget Act of 1997, \nwhen I was chairman of the Budget Committee, created the National \nBipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare. This Commission was \ncreated to address the issue of modernization. The Commission supported \nchanges to the program that would have provided an additional \nprescription drug benefit as well as modernized the Medicare system--\nnot one without the other, but both.\n  Unfortunately, that Commission failed in part because of lack of \nsupport from the previous administration's appointees to address the \nfundamental problem of the program's design. A majority of the \nCommission was for it, but we structured it where 60 percent was \nrequired, and the President withheld his support after all the work \nthat was done. The point is, clearly even back then we were tying \nmodernization to prescriptions.\n  In 2001, again as chairman of the Budget Committee, the budget \nresolution provided $300 billion, and we are now up to $400 billion. \nThe budget resolution said $300 billion for prescription drug benefits \nand it required modernization of the program. It said $300 billion way \nback then. Don Nickles, as chairman, took it up to $400 billion. It did \nnot say for prescription drugs, it said for prescription drugs and \nmodernization. Why? Because one without the other is never going to \nwork. If you have a prescription drug benefit for the seniors and do \nnothing to the underlying Medicare Program, you have taken care of one \nof the problems for a couple of years but you will be back with a \nbigger problem. That bigger problem is the Medicare system itself. With \nthe great change in demographics this country is going to be \nexperiencing, we will be in big trouble.\n  Medicare beneficiaries have waited too long for prescription drug \ncoverage. I am pleased this year appears to be a breakthrough year. \nBefore we are finished, there will be many Senators we will be able to \nthank. This will be the year we finally help millions of Medicare \nbeneficiaries obtain affordable prescription drugs. The bill will also \nprovide substantial relief for those with the highest drug costs. It \nwill also provide prescription drug coverage at little or no cost to \nthose with low incomes.\n  When this bill passes, we will be providing seniors with prescription \ndrug coverage for the first time since the program's creation in 1965. \nAcross America, there are still millions of people who do not know that \nMedicare provides by law not one nickel's worth of prescription \nbenefits. It is not that the benefit is inadequate or that it is \nwritten wrong, it just did not provide for a benefit; that need was not \ncontemplated in 1965.\n  It has been hard to get a bill that really has a chance. This bill \nhas a chance. It contains new accounting safeguards that put the \nprogram on a stronger financial foundation. The legislation contains \npreventive care measures, including screening for diabetes and \ncardiovascular disease. It provides benefits for coordinated care for \npeople with chronic illnesses. None of these benefits was provided \nunder the 1965 act because the need was not contemplated as part of the \nhealth delivery system. These benefits are needed today, but they are \nexcluded from the current Medicare system.\n  This is by far the best opportunity, speaking on behalf of my \nconstituents in my home State, that New Mexico has had to get doctors, \nhospitals, home health care providers, nursing homes, and Medicare \nbeneficiaries fair and equal treatment. Before this bill, each of these \ngroups had been shortchanged by the health care laws of our country.\n\n  I am particularly pleased this bill contains $25 billion in \ninitiatives aimed at providing health care in rural areas. We can thank \nSenator Grassley for being so steadfast on that provision. The Finance \nCommittee estimates my home State of New Mexico can expect \napproximately $140 million over the next 10 years in increased doctor \nand hospital reimbursements. That is because we are so low. This brings \nus to parity and fairness.\n  This bill includes $50 million to equalize payments between large \nurban hospitals and rural and small hospitals, $15 million to increase \npayments to disproportionate share hospitals, $1 million in payments to \ncritical access hospitals, $50 million in increased payments for \ndoctors, and $3 million in incentive payments to encourage physicians \nto practice in areas where there are shortages.\n  Beginning in 2006, again for my State, all 250,000 Medicare \nbeneficiaries living in New Mexico will be eligible to get prescription \ndrug coverage through a Medicare-approved plan. This bipartisan \nagreement will give 55,000 Medicare beneficiaries in New Mexico access \nto drug coverage they would not otherwise have. Nearly 17,000 of those \nbeneficiaries will qualify for reduced premiums, lower deductibles, \ncoinsurance, and no gap coverage. Unquestionably, these provisions will \nhelp improve access to health care and treatment for seniors.\n  We have a great opportunity, fellow Senators, to fulfill our promise \nto the American people and provide our seniors with high-quality \nprescription drug benefits. I believe prescription costs will be \nmanageable, even with the baby boom generation that will then be \nretiring. Some worry about the costs of this bill, but I am confident \nabout the future of American ingenuity and competition, America's \nscience achievements, and America's wellness achievements.\n  As I said this spring when we were debating this bill, we are not \nliving in a stagnant world. American scientists today are reaching for \nhealth care breakthroughs linked to the mapping of the human genome. \nAdvances in nanoscience and microtechnology will change medicine and \nhealth care as we know it today. However, while that work continues, \nthis long-awaited prescription drug plan is what we need now. I am \nsuggesting when I talk about the future breakthroughs that we may be \nastonished at how much we are going to be able to do that we cannot do \ntoday that may save lives and save money.\n  I encourage my colleagues to put their differences aside today and, \nmost of all, to put their politics aside, and do what is best for the \nAmerican people. Overwhelmingly, my constituents have contacted me and \nasked that I support this legislation.\n  Seniors need affordable prescription drugs, and if Congress fails to \nact this year, it will likely be many more years before beneficiaries \nare able to access prescription drugs through Medicare.\n  It is for those reasons--all of them; the national reasons and the \nparochial New Mexico reasons--that I have indicated that lead me to \nsaying I will support this bill. And I hope we do it quickly.\n  Now, we have an additional Senator. Mr. President, how much time do \nwe have left in this block of time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirteen minutes fifty seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I understand we have a Senator who is \ncoming over to use that time. Until they do, I will yield that time to \nSenator Grassley.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could just be heard briefly.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Sure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. We had a Senator who took an extra 5 minutes today because \nof various reasons, so it is my understanding that the distinguished \nSenator from Kentucky wants an extra 5 minutes. We would be happy to \nagree to that. So we would just add that on to what time he has.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I say to the Senator, Senator Grassley is in charge. I \nwill just wait to see what he says.\n\n[[Page S15619]]\n\n  Mr. REID. Is the Senator on his way down?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I say to the distinguished Democratic whip, it is my \nunderstanding the Senator is on his way to the Chamber from Senator \nFrist's office right now.\n  Mr. REID. We would agree to give him that extra 5 minutes.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, finally, after 38 years, Medicare will \nfinally give our most frail citizens help in acquiring the miracle of \nmodern medicine: prescription drugs. They save lives, but they are not \ncheap.\n  After decades of talking, while our seniors waited, tomorrow we vote \nyes or no on a Medicare prescription drug benefit. It is now or never \nfor our seniors. And for their drug benefit, this is the bill and this \nis the time.\n  On one side stand 40 million seniors, the American Medical \nAssociation, the AARP, and hundreds of other citizen groups. On the \nother side stand some Senate Democrats itching to kill this bill. Do \nnot be fooled by those who think we can do something better at some \npoint later. We are already 38 years late, and this is as close as we \nwill ever come.\n  So for our seniors to get a Medicare drug benefit, it is now or \nnever. Incredibly, there are those in this Senate who say never. They \nplan to filibuster the Medicare drug benefit or use procedural measures \ndesigned to do the same thing as a filibuster--kill the bill.\n  Let me repeat that. Some of our Democratic colleagues are trying to \nkill this bill. For 38 years there has been no prescription drug \nbenefit, none. Now, when it comes time to actually pass a drug benefit, \nsome of our Democratic colleagues are filibustering. That is truly \nastonishing.\n  Now, we will hear a lot more debate about whether there is too much \nor too little Medicare prescription drugs. And we will hear a lot of \ntalk that there is too much or too little reform to preserve Medicare.\n\n  Mr. President, I believe we do more for Medicare prescription drugs \nthan most could have ever expected. We do more to preserve Medicare for \nthe future than most presently expect.\n  Before I discuss the reforms to preserve Medicare, I would like to \nfocus on the new Medicare prescription drug benefit. The facts are that \nwe provide $400 billion for a Medicare prescription drug benefit over a \ndecade, about a third more than our Senate colleagues proposed just 2 \nyears ago--a third more than was proposed just 2 years ago--and one and \na half times more than President Clinton proposed for a Medicare drug \nbenefit.\n  This unprecedented investment in our seniors' health translates into \nan incredible amount of relief for our seniors.\n  Back home, in my State of Kentucky, for example, there are about \n650,000 seniors who will share in that relief. So what does this relief \nmean to them? The first comfort is that all 650,000 Kentucky seniors--\nwhether rich, poor, or in between--will never again face the fear of \nbeing wiped out--completely wiped out--by catastrophic drug costs.\n  Under this plan, Medicare will cover a minimum of 95 percent of all \ncatastrophic prescription drug costs.\n  Next, all Kentucky seniors currently paying full retail drug prices \nwill be able to cut their prescription drug costs by an estimated 50 \npercent or more once they enroll in this new plan.\n  For those 235,000 Kentucky seniors with low incomes--low-income \nseniors--they will never again have to choose between food on the table \nor medicine in the cabinet--never again. They will get 95 percent to 99 \npercent of their prescription drug costs fully covered. None of those \n235,000 Kentuckians will pay more than $2 for generic drugs or $5 for \nbrand-name drugs, and most will pay even less than that.\n  Another 56,000 Kentuckians, with moderate incomes, will get \nassistance with their premiums, deductibles, and coinsurance.\n  While the full drug plan will not start until 2006, all Kentuckians \ncan benefit from an immediate helping hand thanks to the Medicare \nprescription drug discount card available as soon as April of next \nyear. This prescription drug benefit card will be available by April of \nnext year. Through group purchasing power and negotiated prices, this \ncard can save seniors between 10 and 25 percent of their drug costs, \nstarting, as I indicated, just next April--right around the corner.\n  Finally, also starting next April, about 123,000 low-income Kentucky \nseniors will be credited up to $600 on that same prescription drug card \nto help tide them over until the full plan takes effect.\n  So this is real relief, and it is just around the corner. But we did \nnot just give Kentucky seniors that real relief, we also gave them real \nchoices.\n  Today, Medicare offers no prescription drug benefit and few choices \nin health care. All that is offered is the traditional hospital and \ndoctor benefit, with a limited managed care option called \nMedicare+Choice.\n  Tomorrow, Medicare also could provide seniors a prescription drug \nbenefit and almost unlimited choices in health care. If we act now, \nevery senior on Medicare will soon have the choice of two prescription \ndrug benefit plans, along with a Federal backup.\n\n  But if not now, then when will seniors get that benefit? Or, if we \nact now, every Medicare senior can choose from a variety of \nMedicare+Choice plans, with a full drug benefit added. But if we do not \noffer that to them now, when will we offer it to them?\n  Another choice is every Medicare senior can choose from three or even \nmore preferred provider organizations. But if we do not offer this \nchoice now, when will we? Or, if we act now, every Medicare senior can \nget help to maintain their current employer-based drug plan. But if we \ndo not offer that now, when are we going to offer it? When would be a \nbetter day than now? Or every Medicare senior can do nothing at all and \nkeep exactly what they have today. Every senior, I repeat, can stay in \nexactly the same coverage they are in today, if they choose to.\n  That is a lot of freedom and a lot of choices--much like those which \nFederal employees and Members of Congress enjoy today. But if we do not \noffer these choices now, when are we going to offer them?\n  This bill provides an excellent prescription drug benefit, a great \narray of choices to get that drug benefit, and a host of new benefits, \nsuch as preventive care, disease management, and comprehensive chronic \ncare.\n  But after all we did for prescription drugs, what did we do to secure \nMedicare's future, you might ask? The reforms may not have gone as far \nas some would have liked, but the good news--the paramount good news--\nis for our Medicare system, a little reform can go a long way.\n  So how far can it go?\n  When a scam artist can make $7 million by selling gauze pads that \ncost a penny but sell them to Medicare for as much as $7, a little \nreform can go a long way.\n  When a shakedown artist can bilk Medicare for as much as $300,000 by \nallegedly providing health care services to a deceased patient--I \nrepeat, a deceased patient--a little reform can stop a real abuse. When \ntwo rented mailboxes and a beeper is all one fugitive needed to scam \nMedicare out of $2.1 million, a little reform can go a long way. When \nMedicare imposes 110,000 pages of regulations, a tower of paperwork 6 \nfeet tall that requires a regiment of clerks to handle, a little reform \ncan mean real savings. When estimates suggest that as much as $33 \nbillion a year is wasted in Medicare and Medicaid--$33 billion a year \nin waste in Medicare and Medicaid--a little reform can do a lot of \ngood.\n  When computational errors at Medicare cost $4.5 billion a year, when \n$2.2 billion is paid out annually to phony businesses, when $23 billion \nis annually overpaid to doctors, hospitals, and other health care \nproviders, and when study after study shows not just poor business \npractices but rampant and outright fraud, waste, and abuse throughout \nMedicare, costing tens of billions of dollars a year, year after year, \ndecade after decade, then a little reform can do enormous good.\n  The reform in this bill is real. We infuse real competition, market \nforces,\n\n[[Page S15620]]\n\nand private sector dynamics to provide the best health care at the best \nprice for our seniors. A wide array of health care providers, insurers, \nplans, and organizations will compete to offer the best health care at \nthe best price, and seniors will be free to choose the best plan for \nthemselves.\n  With all of these choices, with all of this competition, ordinary \npeople providing health care across this land are soon going to do a \nvery extraordinary thing. They are going to figure out how to provide \nseniors all the quality health care they want without all the waste, \nfraud, and abuse in Medicare that no one wants.\n  And who will benefit? Of course, our seniors will benefit. And so, \ntoo, will our children. When our seniors get a quadcane such as this \none for $15, like the Veterans Administration pays--the VA pays $15 for \nthis quadcane, but Medicare pays $44 for the very same cane--stopping \nthis kind of abuse is going to save our parents and our children. When \nour seniors get a catheter for a dollar, as most Federal Employee \nHealth Plans pay, instead of the $12 Medicare typically pays, our \nparents and children both win.\n  These potential savings are not conjecture. This is not guesswork. We \nknow that under imperfect--if not hostile--rules and regulations, the \nhealth care providers in the Medicare+Choice Program were able to give \nour seniors all the services of traditional Medicare and wring out \nenough savings to provide seniors an average drug benefit of about $857 \na year. With this bill, the power to convert Medicare waste into \nMedicare benefits, which we only saw a flash of in the Medicare+Choice \nplans, will now be fully unleashed.\n  There was always a riddle to the Medicare drug benefit. That riddle \nwas: Could we help our parents without harming our children? Could we \nadd a prescription drug benefit to Medicare today yet still preserve \nMedicare benefits tomorrow? The answer to the riddle was always reform. \nIn this bill, we have done enough reform to rein in the waste I have \ntouched upon earlier.\n  To my colleagues on this side, I would agree there could be more \nreform in Medicare than we have in this bill. But there can be no \nreform of Medicare without this bill. We could have more reform than we \nhave in this bill, but we will have no reform without this bill. The \nreforms are more than a first step. They reflect a bold, new direction. \nThat new direction for Medicare flows from the market-based incentives \nin this bill that I believe will do more good to reform Medicare than \nour colleagues can possibly imagine.\n\n  Our colleagues need to recall that every time we have placed our \nfaith in the ability of free market forces to provide for our people, \nour Nation has been richly rewarded. When we infused our energy markets \nwith market competition, the gas shortages and economic stagnation of \nthe 1970s were replaced by energy stability and two decades of solid \neconomic growth. When we reformed Welfare-to-Work, we relied on the \nprivate sector to provide the best welfare program man had ever \ndevised--a job. And the welfare reform of 1996 has worked better than \nwe could ever have imagined.\n  Today we tap those same forces that saved our economic security and \nimproved the well-being of the neediest to save Medicare for our \nchildren and improve Medicare for our parents.\n  I believe this new drug benefit will meet the needs of our seniors. I \nbelieve the reforms will meet the needs of our children. Now is the \ntime to act. Now is not the time to filibuster. Our seniors deserve \nbetter than that from us. Thirty-eight years of waiting is long enough. \nWe must not filibuster and kill the bill providing a prescription drug \nbenefit for 40 million seniors.\n  Doctors, hospitals, and seniors have all said this Medicare \nprescription drug plan is the right plan at the right time. They all \nstrongly support this. We should support it, too. Our seniors, the \ngreatest generation, have been there for us. Now we need to be there \nfor them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, here it is, about 675 pages of \na bill. I have spent the better part of this past week trying to \ncomprehend all of the nuances in this legislation, and of course a lot \nof that was difficult since the conference committee was still \nnegotiating up through Thursday night, and some of the final things \nthat are in the legislation we didn't find out until late in the game.\n  But having spent a considerable bit of time, I believe I have a \nfairly comprehensive knowledge of it. I want to give my comments and \nconclusions as to why this legislation is not in the best interest of \nthis country and is it not in the best interest of our seniors. \nTherefore, I am going to give my reasons why I am going to vote against \nthis legislation.\n  At the end of the day, what we need in America is a health care \ndelivery system that is organized in a logical manner. The way we \norganize health insurance, as it has grown up historically around \nemployers, if the employer is large enough, then the group of people \nwho are insured for their medical expenses, you can spread the health \nrisk over that large group. That brings down the per-unit price or the \ncosts, the premiums that people pay.\n  But all employers are not large. Indeed, in my experience for 6 years \nas Florida's elected insurance commissioner, what I found was that not \nonly was it very difficult for individuals to get health insurance and \npay the prohibitive costs of the premiums but there was a gaming of the \nsystem that went on by some insurance companies. By having group \ncoverage, a group was established, a rate was set for that group. \nUsually the rate was a very low rate or premium in order to entice \npeople into that group to be insured for their health care. And then, \nas the group got older and it got sicker, they would not expand the \ngroup, so the size of the group began to contract. Yet people in the \ngroup are getting older and sicker, and you can guess what happens to \nthe cost of that health care; and as those costs rise, so do the \npremiums and those people in that group had no other choice. They could \nnot go out and get into another group, unless they happened to join an \nemployer who had a large one.\n\n  That is the way the system in America is organized. That is not a \nlogical system. What we ought to do is be creating the largest groups \npossible, the largest pools, so that you can take the health risk and \nspread it over that large number of people--young and old, sick and \nwell, geographically disbursed--so that the cost of that health care is \nspread over the larger number and, therefore, the cost per person, the \npremiums, are much lower.\n  One of the reasons I oppose this legislation is that it is the \nbeginning of the violation of that principle of insurance, for what \nthis legislation is doing is beginning to fragment the seniors as a \ngroup and beginning to create groups where well senior citizens will be \nencouraged to join, leaving the sicker senior citizens for the \ntraditional fee-for-service Medicare and for the prescription drugs \nthat go along with that Medicare.\n  For example, what we have in this bill is that prescription drugs \nwill be provided in an area. I think the country is divided into 10 \nareas. I heard it said earlier that it may be as many as 50. But \nwhatever it is, the whole country is divided. In that particular area, \nthere has to be a prescription drug plan for Medicare, as the basic \nunderpinning of fee-for-service, and also the opportunity for managed \ncare, either a PPO or an HMO.\n  Now, here is what is going to happen. First of all, the PPOs and the \nHMOs, under this bill, are heavily subsidized by the U.S. Government. \nThere is $12 billion in this bill that is a subsidy to PPOs, money to \nbe released at the discretion of the Secretary of HHS. This money would \nbe to help the PPOs, managed care, to become more competitive. And \nguess what. It is going to help them go out and recruit senior citizens \nto come into the PPOs.\n  So, too, there is a subsidy here for HMOs. Medicare fee-for-service \nis reimbursed at 100 percent. In this bill, a kicker is given to HMOs \nof 109 percent; they are going to be reimbursed for those medical \nexpenses.\n\n[[Page S15621]]\n\n  So, by this legislation, we are setting a policy that says we are \ngoing to encourage seniors to go into those managed care plans--managed \ncare plans that, in fact, will then take away a lot of the choice for \nseniors to select their own doctor.\n  What is that going to leave then? As they recruit the more well \nsenior citizens, then Medicare, with its own prescription drug plan, is \ngoing to have all others. And guess what is going to happen to that $35 \npremium that has been promised. It hasn't been promised that it is \ngoing to stay the same. To the contrary, that $35 premium per month is \ngoing to start escalating. It is going to be hiked. Therefore, what is \ngoing to happen to the poor and the sick among our senior citizens? It \nis not going to be as it has been represented here.\n  So I see this as a giveaway to HMOs and PPOs. I see it as pushing \nseniors into managed care, where they will lose their choice of \ndoctors. That is my first objection.\n  Of course, there is a lot in this bill that is salutary. I voted for \nthe bill when it came through the Senate because I believed that it was \na first step in what I thought was a very important policy goal--that \nwe modernize Medicare with a prescription drug benefit.\n  But what has been added has made it too onerous for me to support. \nLet me tell you about the second reason I am not going to vote for this \nlegislation.\n  It is widely acknowledged by several very respected studies that the \nprivate sector employers who are covering the prescription drugs for \ntheir retirees, from their private employment, are going to drop that \ndrug coverage that is now coming from the private sector. It is \nestimated by several, including CBO, the Congressional Budget Office--\nan arm of the Congress of the United States--that some 2.7 million \nseniors in this country are going to be dropped, which means they will \nonly have the choice of getting prescription drugs under the deficient \nplan that comes under this bill. So they are going to be getting less.\n  You talk about being mad. You talk about being upset. When they have \na very robust plan and they could go to the pharmacy and have their \nformer employer, under that retiree plan, pay for their drugs and \nsuddenly they get dropped because now there is an inadequate \nprescription drug plan, well, in my State of Florida alone, it is going \nto be 166,000 people who are going to be dropped. There is going to be, \nindeed, some increase under the bill of those who are not covered now \nup to 150 percent of the poverty level of senior citizens, and I salute \nthat.\n  You would think that in a State such as mine, which only covers poor \nseniors with Medicaid, a Federal and State health care program, you \nwould think, since our State of Florida only covers up to 88 percent of \npoverty level, that would be a big benefit--to go from 88 to 150 \npercent of poverty level. Yet, in fact, there is some help there, but \nit is not much because this 675 pages includes a new assets test that \nis going to drop a lot of those people who are not covered by Medicaid \nin Florida, who would be covered under the bill--they are not going to \nbe eligible because there is now a new assets test and there is a part \nin this 675-page bill that will not allow them to receive all of the \nbrands of drugs that they want because there is a limitation in here on \nthe class of drugs, and how it is defined.\n  Let me tell you, Mr. President, there are going to be some upset \nseniors who think they are in the range of 150 percent of the poverty \nlevel and below, and they are going to get covered and then they are \ngoing to suddenly realize they are not. That is going to happen a lot \nin my State of Florida. This is another reason I am not going to vote \nfor the bill.\n  A third reason is that there is no competition for the prescription \ndrug plan. I happen to think if we want to have a comprehensive, \noverall health insurance plan in this country, it ought to be as wide \nas possible with the biggest possible pools, and there ought to be \nprivate sector competition so we get the efficiencies and economies \nthrough competition.\n  That is not what happens in this bill. What happens in this bill is \nif you don't have two prescription drug plans attached to Medicare in \nthat particular region of the country, there is no competition between \nthe two. You can't say there is just going to be competition with the \nPDP and the PPO or the HMO. No, they are going to siphon off the more \nwell seniors so if you don't have two prescription drug plans competing \nin price and there is only one, what do you think is going to happen to \nthe cost? What do you think is going to happen to the monthly premium \nthat was set initially at $35 a month? It is going to go one way. It is \ngoing to go up because the cost of those drugs is going to go up.\n  This bill is not pro-competition. This bill is pro private plans.\n  Another reason 35 bucks is going to go up is the fact that right now \nunder the Medicare system, Medicare Part B, seniors pay the same \npremium throughout the country, but we know in some parts of the \ncountry health care costs are higher than in other parts. The costs in \nSouth Florida are higher than the costs in Iowa. But now the country is \ngoing to be divided up, in how many regions? I thought it was 10. I \nheard earlier in the debate it is 50. However many regions, it is going \nto be divided up, it is going to more reflect the cost in that region.\n  You might say that is a good thing unless you come from a State such \nas mine which has a higher percentage of the population of seniors than \nany other State because, why? When they retire they want to come to the \nland of sunshine and enjoy the benefits of our environment.\n  So because there is no competition and because the universality of \nthe Medicare premium that has been in effect since 1965 is going to be \nabolished for prescription drugs, what is going to happen? The \nprescription drug premium is going to get hiked all the way to the \nMoon.\n  A fourth reason for opposing this legislation is that $400 billion is \na lot of money, indeed, and if we were getting a true comprehensive \ndrug benefit for $400 billion, it would well be worth it because \nMedicare needs to be modernized. If we were doing Medicare again in \n1965, would we include a prescription drug benefit? Of course we would, \nbecause of all the wonders of these miracle drugs.\n  So $400 billion is a lot of money, but it is not being efficiently \nspent in this bill. Why? Aside from all of these provisions I talked \nabout--about splitting up all of the groups and making them inefficient \nand siphoning off well seniors and leaving the sick seniors for the \nremainder--we cannot do anything in this bill about the prices of \ndrugs.\n  In this bill, there are two little paragraphs that do not allow \nMedicare to negotiate the price. I always thought the free market was \nabout economies of scale, of being able to get better prices. That is \nthe whole theory of Wal-Mart. In bulk purchasing, they bring down the \nprice. This is an anti-Wal-Mart policy bill because it does not allow \nbulk buying, as has been stated many times before, which has been done \nwith other agencies of Government, particularly the Veterans \nAdministration.\n  Mr. President, I supported the bipartisan bill we crafted in the \nSenate earlier this year. Unfortunately, this agreement does not \nadequately protect seniors' retire coverage, moves too many seniors \ninto private plans, and fails to do anything about the escalating costs \nof prescription drugs.\n  When Medicare was passed 40 years ago, we promised our seniors they \nwould have access to medical care as they grew older. As a matter of \nfact, since the passage of Medicare, seniors' life expectancy has \nincreased about 25 percent.\n  The agreement that we will be voting on has little to do with \nproviding a prescription drug benefit to seniors and a lot more about \nenticing private insurance companies to take over for the Government.\n  The financial incentives to private companies and creative trappings \ninserted in the bill will do nothing less than limit seniors' choices--\nmostly because of cost. Seniors may be forced into HMOs or PPOs because \nit may be the only affordable way to at least have access to a \nprescription drug benefit. Affordable, because the bill provides a $12 \nbillion subsidy for PPOs and a reimbursement rate of 9 percent above \nMedicare for HMOs.\n  Since 1999, in Florida alone over 260,000 seniors and people with \ndisabilities were abandoned by their private Medicare HMOs. As \nFlorida's former insurance commissioner, I recall having to beg these \nplans to stay in our\n\n[[Page S15622]]\n\nState and continue providing care to our seniors.\n  This conference agreement, with its various incentives--from a $12 \nbillion slush fund, to its risk buyout, is nothing more than a give-\naway to insurance companies.\n  Private health plans are in the business of making money, and have \nroutinely blamed low profit margins as their reason to drop seniors. In \ncomparison to Medicare, they have failed to be as effective in \ncontrolling their own costs.\n  HMOs have managed to lure the healthiest of our seniors in order to \nmaximize their reimbursement from the government. Currently, they \nreceive about 16 percent more per beneficiary than is paid out through \nthe traditional Medicare program. If these savings aren't enough to \nfeed their profit margins, then the increased payments included in the \nbill will.\n  The agreement proposes payments to HMOs of 109 percent of the fee-\nfor-service rate. This cumulative effect results in our government \npaying private plans 25 percent more than what it would cost Medicare \nto provide that same care. How can that be considered competition?\n  I am also concerned that the agreement before us could create premium \nvariations across the country, and even within my own State of Florida.\n  While we all keep hearing about this $35 monthly premium, there is \nnothing written in the law that limits the premium to that amount. That \nnumber is simply an average which between now and 2006 could certainly \nincrease just as the rest of the costs of health care are.\n  In addition, I am envisioning a scenario where seniors who do not \nhave access to a fallback because there is one HMO or PPO plan and one \nprescription drug plan are left without any real choice. Then, if the \ndrug plan, PDP, has no competition, it can raise the annual premium at \nwill.\n  Since there are no limits and the premium from a private drug plan \ncould be hiked to the moon, they could essentially create a situation \nwhere a senior has no other choice--based on costs--but to join an HMO \nor PPO and give up their choice of doctors.\n  Again, we see an example of this bill's failure to allow true \ncompetition to take place.\n  Under the fallback plan included in the Senate bill there would be at \nleast two of the same kinds of plans competing in each region. This \nwould have created an incentive for the drug plans to keep their \npremiums competitive.\n  During a careful examination of this agreement, I also became aware \nthat the private drug plans are allowed the greatest flexibility \npossible. Little consideration is given to the particular needs of the \nbeneficiary.\n  For example, each Medicare drug plan could have its own list of \ncovered drugs, or formulary. The only requirement is that the private \ndrug plan covers at least one drug in each ``therapeutic class.'' The \ndefinition of a therapeutic class; however, is left up to the plan \nitself. A plan might choose to exclude certain high-cost drugs for \nfinancial reasons, leaving seniors who depend on those drugs without \ncoverage for them.\n  I am also very disappointed that this agreement prohibits Medicare \nfrom negotiating better prices from drug manufacturers.\n  In 2001, the cost of prescription drugs rose more than 15 percent--\nthe seventh straight year of double-digit increases.\n  When we consider the fact that drug prices have been increasing by \ndouble digits in recent years, it does not make any sense to let these \nprices go unchecked.\n  In light of our limited resources, wouldn't our seniors have been \nbetter served if we had addressed the issue of drug costs? We even have \na proven model for success in the Veterans Administration, which has \nused its bulk purchasing power to negotiate with the drug companies for \ndramatically reduced prices. Medicare could do the same, saving our \nseniors and the taxpayers billions of dollars.\n  Our Nation's seniors, when unable to afford their own drugs, turned \nto Canada for relief. This bill continues the stalemate between \nsupporters of importation and the FDA by including the poison pill \nprovision requiring a certification from the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services before medications can be legally imported.\n  At a Commerce Committee hearing last week on this exact issue, \nsupporters of importation argued that in the absence of trying to \ncontrol the increasing prices of drugs, importation should be at least \nan option to provide short-term price relief.\n  In making my decision to oppose this legislation, I considered who \nwould be better off versus who would be worse off.\n  One-third of Medicare beneficiaries have no drug coverage at all, \nanother one-third of them have access to prescription drugs through \ntheir retiree health care plans.\n  The legislation before us will cause private employers to drop 25 \npercent of their retirees. In the State of Florida, that could mean \nover 166,000 retired seniors would lose the coverage they worked all of \ntheir lives to earn.\n  Another group that fares worse under this agreement are those seniors \nwho are over 65 and also eligible for Medicaid. We fought long and hard \nto have these duel-eligible seniors covered under Medicare. However, \nprovisions in the agreement raise the asset tests and restrict the \nMedicaid program from paying the senior's copayment, and that leaves \nseniors worse off.\n  Medicaid beneficiaries in Florida have access to all classes of drugs \nand all drugs within those classes. Should patients have trouble \ngetting their medications, their physicians are allowed to appeal \ndirectly to Medicaid. The limited formularies allowed under the \nagreement for Medicare could jeopardize a senior's access to the drugs \nthey need.\n  Despite our best efforts in trying to minimize cuts to cancer care in \nthis legislation, the agreement will result in an $11.5 billion cut. \nThe ripple effect of these cuts and the reaction of private sector \ninsurers will threaten community cancer centers' ability to continue \ntreating patients.\n  I reiterate my support for the providers of care to America's \nseniors. To our doctors, our hospitals, and nursing homes--I support \nthe provisions in this bill that will allow them to continue to serve \nour seniors.\n  For Florida's hospitals alone, this bill means almost $740 million in \nimproved Medicare reimbursement over the next 10 years, and I am \npleased about that. But these reimbursements to health care providers \nshould not be held hostage in a 675-page bill that has many defects.\n  In the final analysis, this agreement fails to fulfill my promise to \nprovide comprehensive prescription drug benefit to seniors. We can do \nbetter. Regardless of whether this bill passes or fails, I intend to \nkeep working to provide that comprehensive benefit. Our seniors deserve \nnothing less.\n  I want to yield the rest of my time to one of my colleagues who needs \nsome time. I wanted to state at least these reasons and try to give the \ncomprehensive overview of the health insurance marketplace, where we \nneed to go eventually to straighten out the mess so that all people can \nbe insured and not just the ones who have it and the 42 million people \nin this country who don't have it. Indeed, this bill is not the first \nstep toward that kind of health care reform.\n  I yield to the Senator from North Carolina the remaining time that I \nhave, which should be about 13 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is about 10 minutes. The Senator from North \nCarolina is recognized.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, may I inquire how much time the Senator \nfrom Florida has remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. About 10 minutes.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Florida very \nmuch for yielding time and allowing me to speak tonight.\n  Medicare was created 40 years ago with the idea of giving seniors \nhealth care to allow them to live out their lives in dignity and self-\nrespect. It was a promise that they could choose their own doctor and \nafford their health care.\n  We clearly need a real prescription drug benefit under Medicare, \nthere is no question about that. The problem is that this bill does a \ngreat deal more harm than good. It is very good for the drug companies, \nit is very good for the HMOs, but it is very bad for seniors and very \nbad for America as a result.\n\n[[Page S15623]]\n\n  Here are some of the reasons: First, it has billions of dollars in \ngiveaways to HMOs and insurance companies, money that could be and \nshould be used to provide a better benefit to seniors who desperately \nneed prescription drugs.\n  Second, it does almost nothing to control the skyrocketing costs of \nprescription drugs which seniors all over America face every single day \nwhen they go to the pharmacy.\n  Third, it contains billions of dollars in tax breaks for \nmillionaires, for the wealthy, which is part of a long pattern by this \nPresident of trying to shift the tax burden. The President is in the \nmiddle, as I speak, of shifting the tax burden in America from wealth \nto work. He wants to get rid of the dividends tax, capital gains tax, \ntaxation of the largest estates, and shift that tax burden right on the \nbacks of middle-class working Americans who are already struggling, \nalready having a difficult time saving, putting money aside, having any \nlevel of financial security. And here we go again, the President of the \nUnited States is in the process of putting an additional burden on the \nvery people who are struggling and who are so critical to getting this \neconomy moving again.\n  This is just another in a long series of efforts by this President \nand this administration to shift the tax burden. There is no question \nthe lobbyists all over Washington are popping the champagne corks as we \nspeak. The drug company stocks are going up. The HMO stocks are going \nup. Do not the drug companies and HMOs make enough already? For all the \nseniors who go to the pharmacy to try to buy medicine and cannot afford \nit, is the really nice thing for us to do right now to help the HMOs \nand drug companies? Are they not doing all right?\n  The truth is we ought to forget the drug companies, forget about the \nHMOs. They are doing a terrific job of taking care of themselves. We in \nthe Senate ought to be focused on trying to help seniors who are \nstruggling.\n  Let me say a word about the giveaways to the HMOs. This bill contains \nsomething that is called a stabilization fund of $12 billion, which is \nnothing but a giveaway to HMOs. The idea is we have been hearing all \nalong that it is important to have competition and the HMOs can be more \ncost-effective than Medicare. I am missing something. If they can be \nmore cost effective than Medicare, why in creation are we giving them \n$12 billion of taxpayer money? At least where I come from, you do not \nhave to give somebody $12 billion to be more cost effective. That is \ntaxpayer money that could be used to help seniors who desperately need \nprescription drugs. But, oh, no, we are going to give them $12 billion, \nmoney that could go to the seniors, money that could give them a decent \nbenefit. Instead, we are going to give it to HMOs. I guess they are \nstruggling so much, they need our help.\n  Then on top of that, we see that the justification for this is that \nthey need money so they can ``compete''? What in the world is that all \nabout?\n  On top of what is being done for the HMOs, we have the drug \ncompanies. This bill does almost nothing to control costs. We have been \nfighting in the Senate to bring down the cost of prescription drugs for \nmonths and years now. The battle is always uphill because the drug \ncompanies have more lobbyists in this town than people who live in my \nhometown where I grew up. They are all over the place.\n  So we are trying to bring down the cost of prescription drugs. The \nWall Street Journal itself calls this a big win for the drug companies. \nTheir stock is going up.\n  Why have we not been able to do the things that need to be done to \nbring the cost of this program under control and, more importantly, to \nbring the cost of prescription drugs under control? I will tell my \ncolleagues why. Because the drug companies are against it. It is just \nthat simple. It is the answer to everything we try to do on the Senate \nfloor to bring down the cost of prescription drugs.\n  We try to do something about misleading drug company advertising on \ntelevision. No, no, we cannot do it. The drug companies are against it.\n  We try to allow the reimportation of prescription drugs from Canada \nto bring down costs for everybody, but we cannot get it passed. Why? \nThe drug companies are against it.\n  We try to do all of this, to allow the market power of the Government \nto be used to negotiate a better price to bring down the cost of \nprescription drugs. We cannot get it done. Why? The drug companies are \nagainst it.\n  We are never going to get health care costs under control in this \ncountry until we stand up to these people, stand up to the drug \ncompanies, stand up to the HMOs.\n  I know in Washington, DC, they are powerful, but out across America, \nthe American people have a great deal more power in this democracy than \nthese lobbyists in Washington. We need to stand up to drug companies \nand HMOs and stand up for the American people.\n  In the middle of not controlling costs, billions of dollars of \ntaxpayer money going to HMOs and drug companies, we have another effort \nto shift the tax burden in this country. It is not as if working, \nmiddle-class families are not struggling enough. It is not as if over \nthe last 20 years we have not gone from them saving money, having \nfinancial security, to today not being able to save, having negative \nsavings as a matter of fact, with one medical emergency or one layoff \nkeeping them from going under.\n  Here is a good idea: Why do we not take another step to shift the tax \nburden away from the wealthy and to the middle class and working \npeople? That is exactly what is happening with these medical savings \naccounts. The only people who are going to be able to afford to take \nadvantage of it are the wealthy. Regular folks cannot save anyway. They \nare not going to be able to put money away in one of these accounts.\n  The bottom line is, this is a bad bill. It is not a first step; it is \na misstep. It takes this country in exactly the wrong direction. We \nneed to stand up and say so. The American people need to hear our \nvoices loudly and clearly. They also need to know what it is we \nactually need to do to provide a prescription drug benefit because they \ndeserve one.\n  I will tell my colleagues what we need to do--put controls on the \ncost of prescription drugs by allowing reimportation from Canada, by \ndoing something about misleading advertising on television, by cracking \ndown on some of the price gouging that is going on. We ought to provide \nthis prescription drug benefit under Medicare. We can give people \nchoices and still stand by the very program that has provided seniors \nwith health care for 40 years now, that so many seniors have depended \non for four decades now.\n  At the end of the day, the American people, seniors, want us to do \nsomething about prescription drugs. We ought to do it. We ought to give \nthem a real benefit. We ought to bring down the costs. We ought to make \nit cost efficient in terms of taxpayer dollars. In order to do it, we \nare going to actually have to have the backbone to stand up to these \ndrug companies and these HMOs and their armies of lobbyists all over \nWashington.\n  I, for one--and I believe some of my colleagues will join me in \nthis--intend to stand up to these people, and I intend to stand up for \nthe American people and fight with everything I have for a real \nprescription drug benefit under Medicare that does not give billions of \ndollars to HMOs and drug companies.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Baucus is the next scheduled speaker. I will ask \nfor a quorum call, but I also ask unanimous consent that the time be \ntaken off his time. It is not fair to wait because we have 4\\1/2\\ \nhours' worth of speakers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Over the last couple of days there have been many \nassertions from my colleagues on the other side of the isle that this \nbill does nothing to lower the cost of prescription drugs.\n\n[[Page S15624]]\n\n  I would like to take this opportunity to set the record straight.\n  The conference report contains a number of significant reforms to \nlower the cost of prescription drugs for not just Medicare \nbeneficiaries, but for all Americans.\n  This bill provides immediate relief to 40 million Medicare \nbeneficiaries by providing a discount drug card starting in April 2004.\n  The voluntary drug card program will save beneficiaries an average of \n10 to 25 percent on the cost of their prescription drugs. Beneficiaries \nwill have the choice of at least two Medicare-endorsed drug discount \ncards.\n  The drug discount program included in the Medicare Prescription Drug \nand Modernization Act also provides low-income beneficiaries with an \nadditional subsidy of $600 to help with the costs of their prescription \ndrugs.\n  This program provides immediate relief to Medicare beneficiaries now \npaying extremely high prices for their prescription drugs.\n  This bill also lowers the price of prescription drugs for Medicare \nbeneficiaries, by eliminating the Average Wholesale Price, AWP, paid \nfor prescription drugs.\n  This provision significantly reduces the prices that Medicare and \nmany private insurers pay for physicians-administered drugs.\n  Under this agreement, Medicare reimbursements will now be based on \nactual prices paid by physicians, rather than fictitious numbers \nreported by manufacturers, providing a ripple effect lowering the cost \nof prescription drugs for not just Medicare beneficiaries but \nindividuals in the private market.\n  The conference report also contains a ``non-interference'' provision \nthat will protect patients and deliver lower prices through market \ncompetition.\n  The conference bill specifies that the Government ``may not interfere \nwith the negotiations between drug manufacturers and pharmacies and PDP \nsponsors'' and ``may not require a particular formulary or institute a \nprice structure.'' It is right here on page 53.\n  Opponents claim that this provision, which originated with Democratic \nproposals, is a concession to the pharmaceutical industry. That is \nplain wrong.\n  The noninterference provision is at the heart of the bill's structure \nfor delivering prescription drug coverage through market competition \nthat gets a good deal for consumers, rather than through price fixing \nby the CMS bureaucracy. As CMS Administrator Tom Scully explained in \nthe November 21, 2003 issue of the Washington Post, if Medicare \nnegotiated prices, ``I wouldn't be negotiating; I'd just be fixing the \nprice. Let's get seniors organized into big purchasing pools that get \nbulk discounts and see how they fare.''\n  Ironically, this provision was created by the Democrats and first \nappeared in May 2000 in a bill sponsored by Senator Daschle and 33 \nDemocratic cosponsors. In June 2000, Mr. Stark included the same \nlanguage in his motion to recommit H.R. 4680. That motion received the \nsupport of 203 Democrats and Mr. Sanders.\n  The provision protects patients by keeping the Government out of \ndecisions about which medicines they will be able to receive. Under \nthis section, CMS will not be able to dictate that drugs must be \nexcluded from a PDP formulary or subjected to reimbursement limits that \neffectively deny access.\n  The bill relies on market competition, not price fixing by CMS, to \ndeliver the drug benefit. The bill's entire approach is to get seniors \nthe best deal through vigorous market competition, not price controls.\n  CBO scores the bill's approach of relying on at-risk private sector \nplans to deliver the prescription drug benefit as getting a higher cost \nmanagement factor for Medicare than bills where private sector \ncompetition is handicapped by Government. The noninterference provision \nprotects this approach, by preventing politicians and bureaucrats from \ngetting into the middle of the very negotiations that drive these \nsavings.\n  Private plans have strong incentives under the bill to negotiate the \nbest possible deals on drug prices, because they are at risk for a \nlarge part of the cost of the benefit. They also will have the market \nclout to obtain large discounts. By driving hard bargains, they will be \nable to offer lower premiums and attract more enrollees.\n  The alternative is a command-and-control system that would not be \nresponsive to consumer desires or marketplace realities. Bureaucrats \nwould swing between adding benefit requirements without a means of \npaying for them and restricting choices and access in an effort to \ncontain costs. This bill wisely rejects that approach. The \nnoninterference provision is the fundamental protection against it.\n  Finally, the conference report lowers the cost of drugs for all \nAmericans by reforming the Hatch-Waxman drug pricing laws.\n  The agreement will speed the process of allowing generic drugs to \ncome to market, which will significantly reduce drug prices.\n  The agreement will provide brand drug companies only one 30-month \nstay on the approval or a generic competitor.\n  Generics would be forced to forego their 180-day generic exclusivity \nif they do not bring a product to market within a specified time \nperiod.\n  These reforms are the most aggressive since Hatch-Waxman laws took \neffect in 1984.\n  These reforms have also earned the strong endorsement of the Generic \nPharmaceutical Association and dozens of allied groups who are \nadvocates of increased generic usage and low drug prices.\n  So to my colleagues who say there is nothing in this bill to lower \ndrug prices, they are not talking about this bill.\n  My friend and colleague on the Finance Committee, Senator Baucus, has \ncome to the floor. He is primarily responsible for the legislation that \nis before us because he has been very willing to work in a bipartisan \nway to get things done. We would not be here today if it was not for \nthe hard work of Senator Baucus, the ranking Democrat on the Finance \nCommittee, and a person with whom I can work very well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, first I deeply thank my good friend from \nIowa, Senator Grassley. I know people in his home State greatly respect \nhim. I read somewhere that he has the highest approval rating of any \npolitician in the State of Iowa. I am sure that is true and I can \nunderstand why. It is because he is straight, down to Earth, and \nhonest. He tells it like he sees it, no guile. I want Senators to know \nthat this is my impression, as well. I say this because when he \nexplains the provisions of this bill, I hope people listen. Senator \nGrassley is not one to gild the lily, not one to indulge in \ninflammatory rhetoric, not one to exaggerate. He is someone who tells \nit like it is. This is a very important personal quality of his, and \none that I revere deeply.\n  I thank the Senator for allowing me to work with him as the chairman \nof the Senate Finance Committee.\n  I would like to take a few minutes to discuss the Medicare conference \nreport before us. I am sure a lot of people across the country have \nheard statements by many Senators and House Members and are wondering \nwho is telling the truth. They hear a set of allegations from one side \nand lots of responses from the other side. It must be incredibly \ndifficult to determine the truth.\n  A few days ago, Senator Breaux and I met with 20 or 25 House \nDemocrats. The group is known as the New Democrats. Senator Breaux and \nI explained to them what was in the bill.\n  Over and over again, the New Democrats asked: What is going on here? \nOur leadership tells us one thing and you are telling us something \nelse. Whom are we to believe?\n  Senator Breaux and I explained the bill to the best of our ability. \nWe tried to be honest and straight with the facts. It is my belief that \nthe facts are usually controlling. Once people understand the facts of \na bill or legislation, they can make up their own minds. It was our \nintention to just give the facts so these House Members could make up \ntheir own minds.\n  I suspect that a lot of them were in a difficult place: stuck between \ntheir leadership, which was pressuring them to do one thing, and the \nfacts which were inclining them in the other direction.\n  I further suspect that many people watching across the country \ntonight\n\n[[Page S15625]]\n\nare wondering the same thing. There are compelling speeches on both \nsides of this debate. Who is telling the truth? After all, that is what \nit is all about.\n  I am going to do the best I can to explain why I am supporting this \nMedicare legislation, why I personally think it is a good bill. I am \ngoing to use the facts, as opposed to rhetoric. I am not a great \nrhetorical speaker. As with the Senator from Iowa, I tend not to \nembellish. Maybe it is because we are from agricultural states. We have \nlearned to accept that we cannot control everything--we cannot control \nthe weather for the crops and the livestock; we cannot control the \nmarket price. We accept reality for what it is and tell it like it is \nbecause that is the way we have grown up. I will do my very best to \ngive a fair take on facts of this bill.\n  Why do I support this bill? For many years, Congress has been trying \nto pass legislation that gives prescription drug benefits to seniors. \nFor many years we have been talking about it. Some years we have come \npretty close. Last year, for example, we were very close. I can \nremember a meeting I had convened in my office with the key Senators: \nOlympia Snowe, Ted Kennedy, Chuck Grassley, Senator Graham, and four or \nfive or six other Senators from both sides of the aisle--liberals and \nconservatives. We came very close.\n  But in the end, partisan politics dominated--I think because some \nwanted an issue, not a solution. We were pulled apart, and in the last \nmoments, we were unable to pass a prescription drug bill.\n\n  Here we are again today. We are even closer this year because we have \nactual legislation that has passed both bodies of the Congress, and a \nconference report before us. It is not possible to get any closer. If \nwe do not pass legislation this time, I do not know if we ever will. \nAnd this would be a tragedy. This bill provides $400 billion over 10 \nyears to create a prescription drug benefits for seniors. This is what \nthe debate comes down to.\n  We know the importance of this bill because drug prices are \nincreasing rapidly, while at the same time, drugs are becoming ever-\nmore important. They oftentimes replace expensive hospital procedures. \nAnd new medications are constantly being developed. New, so-called \nmiracle drugs are being developed today that will help treat many \ndifferent illnesses in the future.\n  Many of our seniors with low incomes and fixed incomes simply cannot \nafford the drugs they depend on. It is critical that we pass this \nlegislation. Every other country in the industrialized world provides \nprescription drug benefits for their seniors. We are the United States \nof America. Why in the world do we not provide prescription drug \nbenefits for our seniors?\n  We should.\n  And we now have the opportunity before us. I do not know when we are \ngoing to get this opportunity again. If we do not act now, the chances \nof passing prescription drug benefits for seniors in the next several \nyears is very slim. Next year we will be faced with higher budget \npressures: The national debt is increasing; our deficits are rising due \nprimarily to uncertainties overseas--Iraq and Iran; due to terrorism; \nand due to greater domestic needs. If we do not pass prescription drug \nbenefits now, we are unlikely to have another opportunity again. If we \ndo not act today, the $400 billion will not be there next year.\n  I also support this legislation because of its very generous low-\nincome subsidies for one-third of all senior citizens. These senior \ncitizens, one-third of all senior citizens, will have 90 percent of \ntheir drug costs paid for. Under this legislation, 90 percent of their \ndrug costs are going to be paid for by the federal government.\n  This is a very important measure in this bill. It provides very \nstrong low-income protections. I do not know if we are going to have \nthese protections again in future Medicare legislation, if we even have \nfuture Medicare bills. When are we going to again have such generous \nassistance for our low-income seniors?\n  An additional reason I support this legislation is that it contains a \nstrong government fall-back plan. This is a technical term which means \nthat when there are not two private drug plans available in any region, \na senior is able to access a guaranteed government fall-back plan for \ntheir drug benefits.\n  The only question is: Are there two private plans in any given region \nof the country? If there are, your prescription drug benefits are \ncovered through the private plan with all of the guarantees that are \nwritten in the legislation to ensure that seniors are not taken \nadvantage of. If there are not two private plans in the area, then the \nGovernment fall-back plan goes into effect.\n  The bottom line is that all seniors in America will get a \nprescription drug benefit. All seniors in America are covered by this \nbill, whether it is in a private drug plan or through the government \nfall-back plan. This is what we mean by a strong Government fall-back--\nall seniors will get the prescription drug benefit.\n  It is true that the House bill did not include a strong government \nfallback. But we are talking about the Conference report. And in this \nlegislation, all seniors will have access to the drug benefit.\n  The fourth reason I support this legislation is rural payment \nequalization, as well as other strong provider provisions.\n  During the many years I have been in this body, I have worked hard to \nmake sure that Montana and other rural States get the same payments for \nhospitals and doctors as urban States, as the big States.\n  We have been fighting for this for years. Finally this legislation \naddresses this inequity. If this bill does not pass, I do not know when \nwe are going to be able to address this issue. Nothing is guaranteed in \nthe future. Times change. Congresses changes. It is difficult to \npredict the future. A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. We \nhave a bird in the hand now.\n  We have strong rural provisions in this legislation. If it does not \npass now, the chances of rural areas getting a square deal and a level \nplaying field are going to be in serious jeopardy.\n  I say to those Senators from rural states, how can you vote against a \nbill and deny increased payments to your home states when you are \nprobably not going to get them again, when you have been fighting so \nhard to get them for so many years?\n  I would now like to turn to another issue that has been discussed \nfrequently and which is of great concern to many Senators, and well it \nshould be.\n  As indicated on this chart, employer-sponsored retiree coverage is \ndeclining.\n  Eighty percent of companies offered retiree health care coverage in \n1991. In 1996, it fell to 71 percent. In 1999, it fell to 66 percent. \nIn 2001, it fell to 62 percent, and 2003, 61 percent. There is a steady \ndecline of companies dropping or reducing their retiree coverage.\n  You might ask, Why is that happening? It is happening because of \ncompetitive pressures. Companies want to cut back on costs wherever \nthey can to maximize their profits. Retiree health benefits is one area \nwhere they are cutting down their costs. They are reducing coverage for \ntheir retirees. It is inevitable and it is happening.\n  Why do I mention this? What does this bill do to address this \nphenomenon? This is an extremely important point, and I hope Senators \nand staff are listening. This bill discourages employer retiree \ndroppage; discourages, not encourages, it. It provides tax-free \nsubsidies for companies to discourage them from dropping their retiree \nbenefits.\n  This bill provides $88 billion--$88 billion--to companies for their \nretiree plans. Eighty-eight billion dollars is going to companies to \ndiscourage them from dropping their retiree plans.\n  The Congressional Budget Office said under the Senate bill that there \nwould be about a 37-percent droppage rate; in the House bill, about 32 \npercent.\n  But in this Conference report, we have provided additional funding. \nThe rate is now down to about 22 percent. But that 22 percent would be \nhigher if this additional money was not provided.\n  The actual number in the conference report is 17 percent. This number \nreflects a more accurate calculation. 22 percent is apples to apples to \nthe 37 and 32 percent in the Senate and House bills. The 17 percent is \na more accurate figure.\n  The net effect is the droppage rate is about 50 percent less as a \nconsequence of the provisions in the conference report. Companies are \ngetting $88 billion to maintain their retiree coverage.\n\n[[Page S15626]]\n\n  I ask my colleagues, if you vote against this bill, what are you \ngoing to say to those employees who lose their retiree coverage when \nyou had the opportunity to vote for a bill that would have provided \nfunding to address this problem? What are you going to say to those \nretirees when you tell them you voted against a bill which would have \ndiscouraged retiree droppage? What are you going say to them? I don't \nknow; it wasn't perfect.\n  This bill has the effect of discouraging--not encouraging--retiree \ndroppage. I hope Senators pay very close attention to this point. This \nissue concerns many Senators.\n  I would like to address another issue--the impact of this bill on \ndual eligibles.\n  We have heard criticism that the effect of this bill is to make drugs \nmore expensive than current law for dual eligible senior citizens.\n  This is completely inaccurate. The assumption behind this argument is \nthat this bill has a $1 and $3 copay for drugs for dual eligibles. For \nseniors who are under 100 percent of poverty, this bill has a $1 copay \nfor generic drugs, and a $3 copay for brand-name prescription drugs.\n  The assumption behind the argument that the 6 or 7 million dual \neligibles will be worse off is that these seniors do not currently have \ncopays under Medicaid. That is not true. Most States, at least 38 \nStates, already have Medicaid copays. The 6 or 7 million worse off is \nsimply a false figure.\n  In fact, most States are under tremendous pressure to reduce the \ncosts of their Medicaid programs. One of the ways they decrease costs \nis through increasing copays.\n  For those Senators who have been claiming that 6 or 7 million will be \nworse off, please look at the Medicaid copays in many States and \nanticipate what will be the situation in the year 2006. It will be \nworse; 38 States have copays. Not all are greater than $1 in $3 now, \nbut if States continue to cut back on Medicaid to balance their \nbudgets, then the copays will rise.\n  Today, Illinois already has $1 and $3 copay. The bill does not hurt \nlow-income seniors in Illinois. In Maryland, there is a $2 co-pay for \nbrand-name prescription drugs. In Massachusetts, it is for all drugs. \nThe same is true for Nevada. I see my good friend Senator Reid is here. \nHe knows more about Nevada than I hope to know. North Dakota is $3 for \na prescription. South Dakota, about the same. And these are just some \nexamples.\n  If you look at the facts, the 7 million figure is closer to about 1 \nmillion.\n  Another inaccurate criticism is premium support. There has been a lot \nof talk that premium support will undermine Medicare as we know it. I \nwould never vote for a bill that I thought would undermine fee-for-\nservice Medicare. I would not do that because I know how important it \nis to seniors, certainly in my State of Montana.\n  In the year 2010 there will be six demonstration projects. That is \nfar better than the House bill which wanted a full-blown nationwide \npremium support. We have heard a lot of horror stories about premium \nsupport, but that is based upon the House bill, which had full-blown, \nnationwide premium support. This is not a fair criticism. People are \ntalking about another bill, not the Conference report before the \nSenate.\n  What is before the Senate is a bill which says in the year 2010 there \nwill be up to six MSAs, metropolitan statistical areas, that could test \nthis concept of premium support. I might add, as I have said before, \nthat Medicare fee for service is held harmless. People in these areas \nwho want to stay in fee for service can. There is no requirement they \nget out of fee for service.\n  Remember, the President earlier proposed legislation that would have \nrequired people to join private plans to get a drug benefit. That was \nthen. This is now. This bill does not say that. This bill says, if you \nwant to stay in fee for service, that is fine. You do not have to join \na private plans.\n  Some Senators also worry that Part B premiums might rise because the \nprivate plans will take the healthiest seniors, forcing up the fee-for-\nservice Part B premium.\n  This argument is not true.\n  All low-income people are held harmless in Medicare fee for service. \nTheir Part B premium cannot go up. They are held totally harmless. As I \nmentioned earlier, a third of America is classified as low income in \nthis bill.\n  What about those who are not low income? This bill limits any premium \nincrease to 5 percent. This is significant.\n  Part B premiums for next year, 2004, are going up about 13 percent \nfor all senior citizens. Why is that? Because this Congress, using its \nbest judgment, has decided to increase dollars to doctors. Seniors pay \nfor 25 percent of this increase through higher Part B premiums.\n  In this bill, the premiums cannot go up by more than 5 percent in the \npremium support areas.\n  Another point: A maximum of 1 million beneficiaries may be affected. \nI mention this number because there are a lot of other figures being \ndiscussed, including that 10 million senior citizens will be affected \nby premium support. Ten million is not an accurate figure. It is not \ntrue. We went to an objective source to find out what is true and \naccurate. We went to the CBO. CBO told us that between 670,000 and 1 \nmillion people could be affected by this bill in the six areas. Even \nso, these people can stay in standard fee for service. They are not \nrequired to go into private plans. There is no incentive, unless a \npremium support plan does offer a much better package, much more in \nbenefits, much lower in costs. That is possible. I don't think it is \nlikely, but it is possible.\n\n  The main point is that very few people could be affected by premium \nsupport. It is not the 10 million figure we have heard. Take the figure \nof 10 million, cross out the zero, and you get the real figure of 1 \nmillion or fewer.\n  Next, this legislation limits the number of sites to six. There can \nbe no more than six MSAs in the Nation. The Secretary has no discretion \nto add more.\n  In addition, this legislation says these demonstrations are limited \nto 6 years. That is in statute. That is not regulation. The Secretary \ncannot change that at his discretion.\n  It takes an act of Congress to extend or expand these six. After 6 \nyears, the issue will be before Congress to decide what to do: Do we \nwant to extend the premium support areas? Do we want to eliminate them? \nDo we want to change them? This cannot, by regulation or the \nSecretary's decision or by the President's decision, be changed; it \ntakes an act of Congress to change.\n  I might add, as well, that there are payments in this legislation \nthat go to preferred provider organizations to see if they can work.\n  But preferred provider organizations have to be regionwide. They have \nto serve the whole region. They cannot pick and choose individual MSAs. \nAs we know of today, HMOs pick and choose. They go to the counties they \nlike and avoid the counties they do not like. They cherry-pick the \nhealthiest people. They do not go to the counties they don't like, \nthose with the less healthy people. This is not the American way.\n  This legislation provides for additional funding for the regionwide \nPPOs which go into existence in the year 2006. There is a $12 billion \nfund which helps get these plans up and started. But again----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, may I ask for a few more minutes?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have 4\\1/2\\ hours of speeches still \ntonight, and that is why we have limited it to half an hour each.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. If I could just have 1 minute?\n  Mr. REID. Sure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I will just sum up by saying, I have spent \na lot of time on this legislation. I am not going to do anything to \nhurt senior citizens. It would be foolhardy, foolish, stupid. And this \nbill does not hurt senior citizens, it helps them.\n  There have been a lot of charges against this bill. It is very easy \nto be negative. It is very easy to find fault with anything.\n  This bill is not perfect, but it is very good.\n  I urge all of us to remember, this is a very good bill. It gives \ngreat assistance to our seniors. We have subsequent years to work on \nit, build upon it, and to make changes. But if we do\n\n[[Page S15627]]\n\nnot pass it now, the chances are very slim we will be able to pass \nprescription drug benefits for seniors again.\n  So I strongly urge my colleagues to support this bill and oppose \nprocedural motions which will impede passage of this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, first of all, I want to underscore the \ncomments about the Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley, which were made by \nthe senior Senator from Montana.\n  Senator Grassley is a dedicated Senator, a gentleman, and I have \ngreat respect for him. So I appreciate the Senator from Montana saying \nthose nice things about the senior Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley.\n  But I also want to say that on our side we have two people who have \nbeen so heavily involved in getting a bill here. One is the ranking \nmember of the Finance Committee, Senator Baucus, who, as he said, is my \nfriend. I have the deepest respect for him, and I know how hard he has \nworked on this legislation. He has kept me apprised of his progress and \nslippage on occasion.\n  Senator Breaux and I, of course, came to the Senate together. There \nis a bond of friendship between us that will last forever.\n  So even though I do not agree with my two friends, Senators Baucus \nand Breaux, on this legislation, no one can take away how hard they \nhave worked on it and how they believe they are doing the right thing.\n  Mr. President, the Presiding Officer knows that my father was a hard \nrock miner. As I look back, the best times we spent together were when \nI was a little boy.\n  My dad worked in a number of mines, but the mine that I remember is a \nmine called The Elvira. My dad worked underground alone, which was, of \ncourse, against the law. No one ever prevented him from doing that. The \nmining inspectors rarely came to Searchlight.\n  It was during the summertime, when I was out of school, the first \nsummer I can remember going down with him, keeping him company.\n  As I look back on my father, those were times we had together \nunderground. I had my own little hat, with a carbide lamp. I was not \nmuch help to him, but I kept him company.\n  My dad was a very quiet man, but he would talk to me. We had \nwonderful times. I would have my own lunch. My mom would pack my lunch.\n  But my dad taught me a lot of things. As I indicated, the finest \nmemories of my dad are from those days we spent together underground.\n  As I got older and stronger there were things I did later, as I \nbecame a teenager, that I could do to help him physically other than \njust keep him company. But those days were not like the days I spent \nalone underground with my dad.\n  He taught me a lot of things. But one of the things he taught me how \nto do was to pan for gold. Of course, we never had much. He never found \nmuch for what he did. There was not much gold there.\n  But I knew how to pan for gold. You would take the rock and grind it \nup real fine into a little metal bowl. Then you would put it in like a \nfrying pan, a pan that was made just for that, and shake it with water \ncoming down. And gold, of course, is very heavy, and the gold would be \nat the bottom. You could see if there was any gold there.\n  The other way, of course, you could find if there was gold is you \ncould send it to an assayer and find out. But the first preliminary \nthing you did was pan for gold.\n  Mr. President, one of the things I learned as a boy in Searchlight is \nthere was a lot of something called iron pyrites. It is fool's gold.\n\n  I have this little rock in my hand. It is the same kind of rock I \nhave pictured on the right side of this chart. If you were up close, \nyou could see this glittery, gold stuff on the rock. It is all over the \nrock, and it looks like gold. It glistens like gold. The only way that \nyou can find out if it is real gold is if you either pan it or assay \nit.\n  What I have shown on the left side of this chart is gold. And what is \nshown on the right side of the chart looks like gold, but it is fool's \ngold.\n  I say to my friends within the sound of my voice, even though this \nproduct looks like gold, I think if you examine it, if you assay it, \nyou will find it is not gold. It is like the iron pyrites in the mines \nof Searchlight. It is something we call fool's gold.\n  This legislation started as a Medicare prescription drug benefit for \nseniors. Now, this large bill we have here, of approximately 700 \npages--approximately 700 pages--about 150 pages of it deal with \nprescription drugs for Medicare. The rest of it is something that I \nnever thought was to be part of the legislation; it is to reform \nMedicare.\n  Now, my friend, John Breaux, has spent a lot of his legislative life \ntalking about the need to reform Medicare. And I have not talked in \ndetail with Senator Breaux, but I am confident he was much more \ninvolved in and concerned about reforming Medicare than the \nprescription drug aspect. That is not necessarily bad, but that is what \nhe was focused on.\n  Senator Breaux believes that Medicare needs reform. During the \nClinton years, he was the chairman of a committee to come up with some \nMedicare reform. And he came up with it. He was the chairman of that \ncommittee. More than 50 percent of the people who served on that panel \nbelieved that his program was good that they had come up with. But \nunder the rules of engagement, it took a supermajority to do that, and \nhe could not get that.\n  So Senator Breaux, as I have already said about my friend--Senator \nBaucus and Senator Breaux, fine people, wonderful Senators, but I think \nthis legislation, which started out as a prescription drug benefit for \nseniors, has gone way beyond that and is now a bill mostly dealing with \nMedicare reform.\n  This legislation is OK at first glance, but if you look at it \nclosely, I believe, as I have indicated on this chart, it is really not \nthe gold, shown on the left, but it is the fool's gold, the iron \npyrites, shown on the right.\n  This summer, we passed a bipartisan prescription drug bill, which was \nnot perfect. As it returned from the House, though, the prescription \ndrug bill that passed the Senate has taken a step backward. It is not \nimperfect; it is bad.\n  I think there are millions of people worse off. It gnaws away at the \nfoundations of Medicare.\n  Seniors have trusted this program for 40 years. My position has been \nthat we should make health care available to every American, we should \ncut costs, we should improve quality, and we should expand access. Upon \nreview of this legislation, we don't have that. We have what I believe \nis an image, an image that looks like gold, but it isn't, it is fool's \ngold.\n  All you have to do is look at the facts. In Nevada, 20,000 low-income \nseniors will have to pay more when this legislation goes into effect. \nThis bill contains an unfair and confusing assets test. Why would we \ncharge someone negatively because they have planned ahead and have a \nburial plot, maybe a car, maybe some furniture? This bill contains an \nunfair and confusing assets test. More affluent seniors are going to be \npunished. That is not right.\n  I have been through this once before as a Member of Congress. On \ncatastrophic, I introduced legislation in the Senate that the chairman \nof the Finance Committee, Lloyd Bentsen, personally criticized me for \nintroducing. That legislation was to repeal catastrophic. I did it \nbecause the seniors of America were up in arms. I was a relatively new \nSenator, and I won't say my colleagues shunned me, but they weren't \nhappy for a while. But that legislation passed. It repealed \ncatastrophic.\n  Catastrophic was directed toward people who had taken care of \nthemselves, had provided for the future. They were being punished for \nhaving done a good job, taking care of the future. They rebelled. And \nthat is what we are going to find here.\n  Clearly, they will pay more in Medicare premiums. The costs of \nMedicare will go up for them. They already pay more than their share of \npayroll and income taxes. They already pay the greater share of \nMedicare costs.\n  I have received some letters from people in Nevada, constituents of \nthe Presiding Officer and me. Let's note what some of them say.\n  Mrs. Betty Sweet of Las Vegas: Don't sell the seniors out to big \nbusiness HMOs. The HMO plan will be a step down in our care.\n  Martha Pruter of Reno: This plan is only going to benefit the \npharmaceutical companies. It will not benefit consumers.\n\n[[Page S15628]]\n\n  Mary Ann Brim of Henderson: I oppose the Medicare bill. Has anyone \ndone the math? I can't believe they would support this bill if they \nhad. Certainly you can come up with something better than this.\n  Now, these people, Mrs. Brim in particular, actually did their \nhomework on the math. The actual drug benefit created by this bill is \nconfusing and offers seniors only a meager drug benefit. Someone who \nspends approximately $5,000 a year on drugs will be stuck with almost \n80 percent of the bill.\n  People have come to me and said: Vote for this. Nothing is going to \nkick in for a couple of years. You are protected. You can talk about \nthe benefits of this bill. Maybe they are right. But in a couple years \nI would look back on this vote saying, I didn't do the right thing \nbecause thousands of retirees in Nevada will lose their coverage as a \nresult of this bill.\n  In Nevada, tens of thousands of seniors stand to lose their current \nretiree drug benefits. The Nevada senior prescription program that \nGovernor Guinn of Nevada tried, it was one program, and nobody even \nsigned up for it. He has one now that is good, people like it, and we \ndon't know what is going to happen. We don't know what is going to \nhappen to this program.\n\n  We heard the distinguished ranking member of the Finance Committee, \nSenator Baucus, talk about demonstration projects, six of them. We \ncould get as many as three of them in Nevada. I don't think we should \nbe used as guinea pigs in an ideological experiment that would force \nthem to give up their doctor and join an HMO or pay higher premiums to \nremain in traditional Medicare. Those who opt for private plans would \nhave to use a doctor approved by the insurance company in these areas. \nOver time the seniors who remained in the traditional fee-for-service \nMedicare would likely be the oldest, the sickest, and the poorest. They \nwould have to pay an ever-increasing premium to maintain their \ncoverage.\n  This bill would make a wide range of seniors worse off than they are \ntoday, from seniors who are eligible for Medicaid, seniors who have \ncoverage through former employers, seniors enrolled in State pharmacy \nprograms, to seniors who will be forced to pay higher premiums to stay \nin traditional Medicare. That is not the type of prescription drug \ncoverage our seniors deserve. It is fool's gold.\n  Many of my colleagues support this bill because they like the concept \nof competition. I like competition, too. But I am in favor of \ncompetition where there is a level playing field. This bill does not \nprovide for fair competition.\n  This rigs the rules in favor of private insurance companies by paying \nthem off to serve a patient whom Medicare would also take care of \nwithout the additional incentive that these companies get. It siphons \noff $12 billion that should be used to help our seniors. It pushes it \noff into a fund for private insurance companies. That is why we have \nread in all of the papers around the country that the insurance \nindustry is wild about this legislation. The pharmaceutical companies \nare wild about this legislation. They wiped out the reimportation we \nhad in our bill, something that went to the House, where we could \nreimport drugs which are much cheaper in Canada. That is eliminated, \nand that is too bad. It was a concept that both the House and the \nSenate approved. This is something that is hard to comprehend.\n  This bill even says that when Medicare becomes the largest purchaser \nof prescription drugs, it is expressly forbidden to negotiate prices \nwith the drug companies. That is why we want these large purchasers of \npharmaceuticals, so they can go to the drug companies and get lower \nprices. In this legislation, they are forbidden from doing this. If we \nreally believe in a free market, why shouldn't Medicare also be able to \nbargain for good prices? It is no wonder big insurance companies and \nbig drug companies are spending millions of dollars on lobbyists and \nads to support this bill.\n  I have to say they have done a good job. I want everyone to know that \nthe drug companies and the insurance companies have spent their money \nwell. Because the lobbyists have really done well by them, this bill is \na dream for the insurance industry and the big drug companies. It tilts \nthe playing field in their favor at the expense of senior citizens. \nThat is not competition, it is corporate welfare.\n  This bill is not what it claims to be, and seniors are smart enough \nto see this bill for what it really is, fool's gold. Betty Sweet, \nMartha Pruter, Mary Ann Brim, they all did their homework and \nunderstand that this legislation is not good.\n  As I have indicated, the actual drug benefit created by this bill is \nconfusing and offers seniors only a meager drug benefit. It is a poor \ntrade when you spend approximately $5,000 a year on drugs and you will \nbe stuck with 80 percent of the bill. When we talk about a \npharmaceutical benefit for Medicare, people think they are going to get \nthe drugs at a reasonable price.\n  The Medicare conference agreement would make fundamental changes to \nMedicare as we know it, changes that have nothing to do with a \nprescription drug benefit or building a stronger foundation for the \nprogram. It would use our senior citizens as guinea pigs to test the \ntheories of Newt Gingrich and other ideologues.\n  Am I off base on this? I carry this with me because I have used it on \na number of occasions, and now it is kind of withered and dilapidated. \nI have seen Newt Gingrich, with whom I served in the Congress--a fine \nperson. I like him. I think he has a great mind. And he has been able, \nwith his great mind, to do some things with which I don't agree. But I \nhave here some statements made by leaders. I believe their whole \nconcept is what is behind this legislation.\n  First of all, this is Senator Bob Dole's direct quote:\n\n       I was there fighting the fight--\n\n  He was 1 of 12 against Medicare--\n\n       because we knew it would not work in 1965.\n\n  He and many colleagues believed it would never work. Senator Dole was \n1 of 12 who voted against it then.\n  Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, said:\n\n       Now, we didn't get rid of it in round one because we didn't \n     think it was politically smart, but we believe Medicare is \n     going to wither on the vine.\n\n  Former House Member Dick Armey said this:\n\n       Medicare has no place in a free world. Social Security is a \n     rotten trick.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       I think we are going to have to bite the bullet and phase \n     it out over time.\n\n  Those are direct quotes. I think part of what we have behind this \nlegislation is an effort to have Medicare wither on the vine, and it \nwill be withering on the vine. I think we should understand that this \nlegislation is not what it purports to be; it is not. As a result of \nthat, I believe we should vote against this legislation.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Senator has 11 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield that time to my colleague from \nNevada, Senator Ensign.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I want to talk about one Senator's journey \nthrough this bill, trying to make a decision based on the facts and \ntrying to get through the rhetoric, because there is a lot of that \ngoing on in any piece of legislation. So I am trying to write down the \npros and the cons of this legislation and go through them in a \nsystematic fashion and try to make a decision based on policy and not \nbased on politics, a decision based on what is in the bill, not on what \npeople are saying is in the bill.\n  As I have gone through this, I have a whole list of general \nprinciples that I believe are good. I have still not made up my mind on \nthis final piece of legislation because it is really a balancing act. \nThere are good things and there are things that are not so good. Just \nto mention a few of the things that I believe are good in this bill, \nprobably the best thing is something called the health savings account, \nwhich has nothing to do with Medicare today. It has to do with \nreforming the overall insurance system in our country for health care. \nIt is something I have been fighting for, for many years and introduced \nlegislation on when I was in the House of Representatives on the Ways \nand Means Committee.\n  We passed it several times, but unfortunately, when we passed the \nfinal version, we had to water it down so\n\n[[Page S15629]]\n\nmuch that we enacted a piece of legislation that did not work. So the \nhealth savings accounts in this piece of legislation, I believe, are \ngoing to be one of the most significant reforms we can possibly enact \nfor the future of bringing the patient back into the accountability \nloop. When you have a third-party payer system--what I mean by that is \nthe person receiving the care doesn't directly pay for the care; it is \na third-party payer system.\n  So when you walk into a doctor and the doctor says we need to run \nthis test and that test, the person doesn't even say how much do those \ntests cost or is there a cheaper place to go get an MRI, for instance, \nor is one place better or cheaper or is a certain specialist better \nthan others or is one cheaper than others, and maybe of the same \nquality--none of those kinds of discussions happens because they are \nnot paying the bill. The health savings account allows them to put \nmoney into an account tax free. It builds up in the account tax free, \nand when it is taken out for health care expenses, it is taken out tax \nfree. Then that person directly pays the doctor.\n\n  Now, why is that significant? It is significant because in our \ncurrent system, whether it is traditional Medicare fee for service, or \neven the HMOs or the PPOs, all the payments go through some kind of \nbureaucracy, whether it is a Government bureaucracy or a private one. \nAnybody that has experienced our health care system today knows that \nmaybe companies are not trying to deny payment but it certainly seems \nlike that in a lot of cases.\n  My in-laws are dealing with this right now. My father-in-law had \ncancer last year. They have been battling for almost a year now on \nwhether the insurance company should pay for a large part of their \ncoverage or not. That takes a lot of time for people to process, to \nanswer phones, go through the whole process. If somebody is paying out \nof their own pocket to the doctor, none of these conversations has to \ntake place, and that money that is saved through the bureaucratic \nprocess can go directly to health care. I believe health savings \naccounts are one of the most positive things in this bill.\n  Mr. President, will the Chair please notify me when there is 1 minute \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will do so.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Second is the means testing idea of Part B, the affluence \ntesting, as it is being called. I think it is wrong. This is not a part \nof Medicare where people are paid in their taxes over the year. Part B \nis something that younger generations--such as the pages we have here--\npeople paying taxes out there are paying for seniors, and we should, at \nleast for those wealthy seniors, have them pay for that benefit they \nare getting, instead of shifting the benefit on to middle-class \ntaxpayers. That is also very good.\n  Another part that is good in the bill is this idea of a disease \nmanagement pilot project. Right now in Medicare, you go to one doctor \nand Medicare pays, and maybe you have diabetes and you have to go to \nseveral specialists, internists, or whatever; there is nothing really \ncoordinating care. So you get different prescriptions and different \ndoctors. There is no real coordination of care and also not a lot is \nbeing done preventively. So we end up with poor-quality care, poor \noutcomes, and we spend more money.\n  We have a great demonstration project, a pilot project that \nRepublicans and Democrats actually should like in this bill on the \ndisease management part of it. In the future, I believe it will improve \noutcomes for seniors healthwise, and it will also save costs.\n  As to some of the negative parts of the bill, first of all, it does \nnot kick in right away. A bill that I introduced would have kicked in \nas soon as the drug discount card kicks in. That is the only thing that \nreally kicks in, in the next 5 or 6 months--the drug discount card. The \nlegislation I had introduced actually would have fully kicked in. The \nDemocrat bill and Republican bill we had debated, none of those kicked \nin right away, and neither does this bill.\n\n  The other problem with this bill is there is a cliff at 150 percent \nof poverty. After that, you kind of drop right off the cliff. So for \nthose below 150 percent of poverty, this is too generous. With a $1 and \n$3 copay, we are going to incentivize people to overutilize drugs, pure \nand simple. You are going to see overutilization of drugs. We see it in \nMedicaid today because of the low copays and we are going to see it \nhere. That was a huge mistake that we didn't once again have people \nreceiving the drugs having anything financial at stake. And $1 and $3 \ncopays will not change behavior in any way whatsoever.\n  The other thing that actually we have to consider--and we should at \nleast go into this with open eyes--this is the largest wealth transfer \nsince Medicare was first put into effect. We just have to know that. \nThe $400 billion is being taken from younger people and given to older \npeople. The older people didn't pay for it. We are giving that. So we \nhave to go into this with open eyes.\n  The other thing I believe is a problem with the drug benefit we have \nin Medicare is that it is giving it to the wealthy. I don't believe we \nshould be. We should be helping and putting almost all the benefit into \nthe people who are literally having to choose between prescription \ndrugs and rent and maybe whether they are going to eat that month or \nwhat kind of food they are going to eat that month.\n  Instead, this bill gives coverage for everybody on Medicare. I don't \nbelieve that is right. When Bill Gates turns 65, I don't believe he \nshould be getting a prescription drug benefit that is paid for by some \nunion worker who worked hard all of their life and paid taxes. I don't \nbelieve that is right. So I believe the prescription drug benefit \nshould be means tested. That is another negative in this particular \npiece of legislation.\n  Just mentioning a couple of the things, there are some really good \npieces of this bill, but there are some major negatives in this bill.\n  When we are going through all of the rhetoric, I think all of us have \nto be honest. The supporters of the bill should be honest that there \nare some problems with it, but the people who are against the bill \nshould also be honest. This does not end Medicare as we know it. This \nis a bill incredibly generous to low-income seniors. Even if I vote \nagainst this bill, I have to say this is incredibly generous to low-\nincome seniors. That is just being honest. All seniors pay out of \npocket is a $1 copay for generics and a $3 copay for brand name \nprescription drugs. That is an incredibly generous benefit.\n  In conclusion, as I go through this next 24 to 48 hours--whenever we \nare going to vote on final passage of the bill--it is a 700-page \ndocument we got a couple of days ago. I think we have to take our time \nto go through the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Taking our time to go through the bill is very wise to do \nbecause my biggest fear--and we see this happen with legislation all \nthe time--when we have this kind of complexity in a document is the law \nof unintended consequences.\n  We enact bills all the time. When we enacted HIPAA--and the majority \nleader is on the floor and he knows better than anybody--the HIPAA law \nis a terrible piece of legislation, and we are suffering consequences \ntoday. We are driving up health care costs unnecessarily because of \nthat legislation. That is why I am still trying to go through this \nlegislation to make up my mind.\n  I thank my colleague, the senior Senator from Nevada, Mr. Reid, for \nyielding me the time to speak tonight. I look forward to hearing the \nmajority leader's comments on this legislation as I am still battling \nthrough what I am going to do on it.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I will be speaking for about 30 minutes. I \nask that the Chair notify me when I have used 25 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be notified.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we are at a truly historic time. A lot of \ntimes we exaggerate a bit to make a point. It seems as if on every bill \nsomebody says: This is a historic bill.\n  As a physician, as someone who has had a great privilege in life, a \nblessing in life to have served as a physician and to have taken an \noath to serve humankind in such an intimate and personal way, I truly \nbelieve it is an historic time because with the action we are almost \ncertainly going to take tomorrow night, we are going to change\n\n[[Page S15630]]\n\nthe lives of 40 million seniors and also 77 million baby boomers who \nwill be seniors over the coming years by this single piece of \nlegislation.\n  It is rare we can say that. It is so rare. Everybody gets sick at \nsome point later in life--everybody. If it reaches a certain threshold, \nyou seek medical care. This bill will affect the type of care you \nreceive, whether or not you have appropriate access, the quality of \nthat care, and the response of the type of care that is given to you. \nThat is why I say it is a historic bill.\n  I am confident we will pass this bill tomorrow night. I know there \nare a lot of statements that have been made: We are going to obstruct; \nwe are going to filibuster; we are going to use procedural moves. But \nat the end of the day, nobody from this body, I believe, can go home \nand say--when we are an eyelash away, after 6 years of hard work of \ntrying to put together the very best bill possible--that we would go \nhome having denied the President, with the leadership he has shown, and \nthe House of Representatives, with the leadership they have shown, and \nthe hard bipartisan work on this floor, and then tell seniors: It is \nnot going to happen. Once again the promises that have been made have \nbeen denied you.\n  Why do I say that? That is the question I wish to answer over the \nnext few minutes.\n  I want to start from afar and then come down to some of the specifics \nof the bill and paint a picture, paint a portrait that I think helps, \nat least in my own thinking, to explain to the American people why this \nis a pivotal time, why we have to act now, why we can't wait another \nyear or 3 years or 5 years, why at this moment in history events have \ncome together in conversion. There is a reason, and when we act, we \nwill have a much more dramatic impact in improving health care and \nimproving health care security than if we were to wait.\n  In 1965, Medicare began. I didn't start practicing medicine until the \neighties, but through that period of time, it is just amazing. We have \nseen health care advances that are remarkable in terms of medicine, \nscience, and technology. The half-life of medicine--that is a \nstatistical way of looking at medicine and advances. It got smaller and \nsmaller and smaller and smaller because of our knowledge and \nunderstanding. Advances have been made in both health services \ndelivery--that is how health care is delivered and how it is \norganized--as well as scientific and technological advances.\n  I am going to show three graphs using this same format. On this Y \naxis is change. It is fairly arbitrary in describing change, but it is \nimprovements, it is how things change over time. Along this X axis, it \nstarts in 1965 when Medicare started and ending in the year 2005, as we \nproject ahead.\n\n  We can see this change came along pretty steadily, and all of a \nsudden it started to go up, up, up, and I would put it way up off the \nchart. That is where this change is going.\n  The first successful heart and liver transplant was in 1965. That is \na fascinating history. That is the field I ended up going into, heart \ntransplant surgery.\n  Coronary angioplasty, when people have drug-eluting stents, and we \nhear about it all the time. It wasn't that long ago. That was just in \n1977. We had the first open heart surgery cases in the 1960s.\n  In 1974, the HMO Act was passed in this body. Prozac, a drug many \npeople are on today, was first used in 1988. It is interesting, when \nthe PPOs--and I will talk more about PPOs shortly--began in 1985, 1 \nmillion people were enrolled. Within 13 years, 90 million people are \nenrolled in these PPOs.\n  We had the human genome project, a fantastic project which just \nfinished this year. It was a successful public-private partnership. \nThis chart shows all the advances. The point is, these advances are \ngetting faster and faster.\n  The next chart uses the same format, but it shows what Medicare has \ndone. Has it changed as well? Medicare has not changed very much. It \nstarted in 1965. It was enacted into law in 1965. It is a great \nprogram, a fantastic program. I had the opportunity to treat thousands \nof patients in Medicare. It has given them health care security.\n  But, contrast Medicare to all the health care advances, and we can \nsee it hasn't changed much over time.\n  In 1972, it was expanded to include end-stage renal disease and \ndialysis. That was a a good advance.\n  There was a good advance in 1985 with prospective payments for \npatients who are actually in hospitals. It was pretty revolutionary at \nthe time.\n  We have had people refer to catastrophic coverage. Notice line went \nup and went down because catastrophic coverage was repealed. A lot of \npeople said: Is this bill going to be repealed? If I have time, I will \ncomment on that because there is a clear answer to why that is \ndifferent.\n  There were prospective payments for physicians 1990. In 1997, we \nadded the Medicare+Choice Program and other prospective payments.\n  Now we are in 2003. And tomorrow night are we going to improve and \nchange Medicare in a positive way. People say you can change Medicare \nand that is bad. That is not bad; that is good.\n  We are going to strengthen and improve Medicare, and that is the \nwhole purpose. The next chart shows very clearly the advances in \ntechnology go on up, but Medicare is too rigid. It does not change. We \nare not capable of changing the structure of Medicare fast enough in \nthis body and therefore that rigid structure cannot adapt to new drugs, \nnew pharmaceutical agents, new ways to deliver health care, new types \nof PPOs. We just do not change.\n  So the gap, is what we are addressing. If we do not pass this bill \ntomorrow night or tomorrow afternoon--the sooner the better on my \npart--I think we are not going to fill this gap, and we are going to be \nstuck down here when all of these advances are up here and these \nadvances are being denied seniors.\n  That is why when people say ``filibuster,'' use procedural moves to \nstop this, do they mean they want to stay down here when we have the \nopportunity, to catch up and let these health advances be delivered to \nour seniors? So that is the way I think about things--in terms of what \nis at stake.\n  I do not think anybody can defeat this bill and go home from here. \nThey cannot face 40 million seniors and say we are not going to give \nthem the advances that are available to the rest of the world. It is \nnot right, if that is the case.\n  Now, why today? I have heard from the other side of the aisle again \nand again: Let's do it next year, 2 years from now, 3 years from now.\n  It is because we have this earthquake, or this mountain, moving \ntowards us, defined in 1945 by the baby boomers. This is a fertility \ncurve. We know after the war, fertility went up 3.5 births per woman. \nThen it fell back down. This is moving through the system to the point \nthat in about 2008 or 2010, this curve will begin to move through the \nMedicare program as these baby boomers age, beginning in about 4 to 5 \nyears.\n  When they hit the system, what happens is potentially catastrophic if \nwe have not prepared the system for that.\n  To explain that, I will use the following several charts. No. 1, \nlet's say I am the Medicare system right here. I have seniors who are \ntaken care of over here, and I have people who are paying--that is all \nthe working people today--to support the Medicare system which takes \ncare of these seniors. Well, what is happening is we are having a \ndoubling of the number of seniors because of the baby boom. So the \npopulation is getting bigger because of the baby boom demographic \nshift. It is this point in history that it occurs. It was not 10 years \nago, and it is not 30 or 40 years from now. It is beginning right now. \nWe have a doubling of the number of seniors.\n  At the same time, because there is a big curve moving through, we \nhave fewer people working to pay. So we have fewer and fewer people \npaying the health care of more and more people over time because it is \na pay-as-you-go system. The people supporting the system today are the \npeople working today.\n  I will show my colleagues graphically exactly what I said. Medicare \nenrollment--that is the number of seniors over 65 years of age--in 1970 \nit was only 20 million. What is important is that there are 40 million \npeople today, but because of the baby boom--look at this curve going \nup--we are going to have twice that in 2030, right at 77 million, this \nchart says, but it will be right at\n\n[[Page S15631]]\n\n80 million. So we have a doubling of the number of people we are going \nto be taking care of over the next 30 years.\n\n  What about the people who are actually taking care of each one of \nthose? In 1970, there were seven people over here working to take care \nof every senior, but because the fertility curve is moving through in \nthe year 2000, it was about four people working. So for every person \nworking to support one, they are having to work a lot harder. There are \nfewer people. Instead of seven working, four are working for each one.\n  What is even worse is that over the next 30 years, instead of four \npeople, it goes to two people. So they are going to have to be working \ntwice as hard for every one person that is benefiting. Yet we have \ntwice as many people who are benefiting. That is the challenge that we \nhave and that is the reason for ``why now.'' That answers the question \nas to why we should do it in this Congress. We should have done it 2, \n4, even 6 years ago. If we do not do it now, it is too late.\n  That is the reality of Medicare. So people say, why do we not give a \ndrug card and leave it at that, take care of a group of people and give \nthem 50 or 70 percent on the card? The point is, that does not address \neverything that I have said to date. It does not address the challenge \nof having a rigid, inflexible, outdated, antiquated Medicare Program, \nand that is why not just a drug card, though a drug card is important, \nand I will come back to that. But that is why that is not the answer.\n  A lot of people say we should not be spending $400 billion. They say \nwe should spend $100 billion and take care of the people who need it \nthe very most. But, that approach does not address the fact that we \nhave an outdated system.\n  I have said on this Senate floor many times the most important tool a \nphysician or a nurse has today to treat a patient is not the surgeon's \nknife that I used every day. It is not the hospital bed. It is not even \nthe hospital. It is pills. It is medicines. It is prescription drugs.\n  Why today? Why are we acting today? That was not true 10 years ago. \nIt was not true 20 years ago. But today it is the most important tool a \nphysician has. Yet it is denied seniors in the Medicare Program. \nSeniors cannot get outpatient prescription drugs through Medicare \ntoday. It is the most important part of health care. Yet we deny it to \nour seniors. That is why nobody can filibuster this bill in good \nconscience because we are denying our seniors the most important tool \nin medicine today.\n  Tomorrow, after we pass this bill, since it has been passed by the \nHouse, and the President is going to sign it, for the first time in the \nhistory of this Medicare Program we are going to have the most \nimportant part of health care as a tool. The most important tool in a \nphysician's armamentarian is prescription drugs. It is being denied \nseniors today.\n  Now, just an example: Cancer, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, \nosteoporosis--there are drugs for all of these diseases. There are 402 \ndrugs right now in clinical development for cancer. So whatever we do, \nwe do not want to destroy the research that is going on in this \ncountry. If drugs are the most important part of health care today, we \nwant to make sure that we promote research and development. That is why \nwe do not engage in governmental price fixing, setting prices by \nGovernment, because it destroys all of this in terms of research.\n\n  NIH does a good job, and we can fund it. We fund several billion \ndollars through our NIH, but the private sector's contribution to \nresearch is many fold what the government provides. So we have to \ncontinue to support that private sector research.\n  So what do we do? Where are we today? Here we go in terms of how we \nmodernize this system, and at the same time address the issue of \nprescription drugs. How do we marry it? This bill does it in a \nbipartisan way.\n  I predict this bill will pass tomorrow with a bipartisan vote. I know \na lot of people are bringing partisan issues to the floor and saying we \nare going to stop it with such things as procedural votes, but this \nbill is going to pass with a strong bipartisan vote tomorrow.\n  Again, what are we going to do? Today, a senior right now has a \nchoice. They can stay in traditional Medicare, just like 35 million \nhave, with good care and a strong system. It is antiquated, it is out \nof date, and it is inadequate compared to other options that people \nhave today. It does not include prescription drugs, for example. Or a \nsenior can go into Medicare+Choice. Five million seniors have chosen to \ngo into Medicare+Choice. They do get some prescription drugs. \nPrescription drugs are in green on these charts. For my colleagues who \nare in the Chamber tonight, they can see the green.\n  So seniors can get some prescription drugs, but there are no \nprescription drugs in traditional Medicare today.\n  No. 1, I mentioned the drug discount card. In this legislation, maybe \n6 or 8 months from now, after we pass this bill and the President signs \nit, seniors will have access to a drug discount card. It will last for \na 2-year period. What it says is while we are developing this system, \nthey can get immediate relief through a card. This card will allow a \nsenior to go to the local pharmacy and get an additional 20-percent \ndiscount. Maybe it is a 10 or 25-percent discount, but however a senior \ngets the drugs they might get today, they will have an additional \ndiscount.\n  It is voluntary. This word ``voluntary'' is key because everything \nthat we put into this program today in terms of prescription drugs or \ngiving a choice of a health care plan that might better suit a senior's \nneeds is voluntary. They can keep exactly what they have today--and \nthis is important for people who are listening. They can keep exactly \nwhat they have today, with no change in their benefits. They might \nalready have prescription drugs so they would not want prescription \ndrugs. All of this is voluntary. It is not mandatory. Nobody is making \nany senior even make a decision to do anything. They can keep exactly \nwhat they have if they are satisfied.\n  In addition to this discount, there is a $600 value if a senior is \nlow income, less than 135 percent of poverty. The chart I just showed \nmy colleagues was Medicare today. Remember, the senior could choose \neither traditional Medicare, which 35 million people have, or \nMedicare+Choice. After this bill passes, we are going to expand the \nopportunity to choose, so seniors for the first time can choose the \nhealth care plan that best suits their individual needs. If you have \nAlzheimer's you might choose a plan that specializes in Alzheimer's. If \nyou have Parkinson's disease or coronary artery disease or you have had \na stroke or you have seizures, there may be plans out there that can \nbest suit your needs that for the first time you will have access to. \nThat is not available in traditional Medicare.\n\n  So a senior can choose under new Medicare. Either the traditional \nMedicare, keep what you have, don't change anything. If you stay in \ntraditional Medicare, for the first time, if you want it--you don't \nhave to take it--you can choose from one of two and maybe three or four \ndrug plans. They will have equal value, but you can have that choice.\n  People say what if the drug plans don't show up? If they don't show \nup, there is a fall-back Government plan there. Everybody can have this \nnew choice, but if you don't want to, keep what you have.\n  In addition, you can choose Medicare+Choice, which are primarily \nHMOs. HMOs are maligned on the Senate floor a lot. You talk to these 5 \nmillion people who are in them, they really like them. But if you want \nto, you are also going to be able to choose, from a preferred provides \norganization or PPO or C. There may be five, there may be three, there \nmay be two, there may be one PPO. These PPOs are integrated health care \nplans. They have disease management. They have this little green down \nthere showing all of them will have access to prescription drugs.\n  People say sick people may stay here or they may go into here or they \nmay go into here. You don't really know. My heart transplant patients, \nwho are among the sickest patients going in--before they get their \ntransplant they are all going to die. Coming out, they require a lot of \nmedicines. I would encourage a lot of those who are among the most \nchallenging to take care of, I would encourage them to go into these \nPPOs. Why? Because they can have a health care plan that is tailored to \ntheir needs, that is able to respond to infectious disease, acute care, \nchronic\n\n[[Page S15632]]\n\ncare, disease management, coordinated care, none of which is available \nunder traditional Medicare. So this is the design. Opportunity to \nchoose all of this. Nobody is forced to choose at any point in time.\n  Transformational: I won't go through all of this, but I wanted to \nshow this because it is hard as you listen to everybody. Everybody is \ntalking about little pieces. Using the same format, let me show some of \nthe things we do.\n  In the PPOs, in the choice over here that we are going to give for \nthe first time--I say it is FEHBP-like. What that simply means is we in \nthe Senate have a choice among a group of plans. I happen to take the \nBlue Cross/Blue Shield plan. That might be one of these plans. But \nseniors will be able to choose, just like we choose, a plan that might \nbest suit their needs.\n  These are integrated plans; that is, acute care, chronic care, \npreventive medicine, coordinated care. You have a choice. You can \nchoose among these plans. There is competition in that these plans will \ncompete one versus the other based on quality, access, and cost. They \ngive the same benefits as traditional Medicare, but there will be \ncompetition among those plans based on any of the issues that I just \nmentioned.\n  The flexibility: What that really says is that this PPO may be \ndifferent than this PPO, different than this PPO. It may give a \ndifferent range of benefits, although all of them will give at least \nthe benefits given in traditional Medicare.\n\n  If you look at the drug plans, I have down that they are risk \nbearing. Risk bearing means the Government itself shares the risk with \nthe plan. That plays into the marketplace. That is the way the private \nsector works. It captures the dynamism of the marketplace and, over \ntime, and with the element of competition, that can bring the cost of \ndrugs and Medicare down. These are competitively bid. Again, they have \nthe flexibility.\n  Traditional Medicare: You have heard people talking about income \nrelating, means testing. For the first time, the very rich, the Ross \nPerots of the world, will no longer have their assistants or their \nsecretaries subsidizing their Part B premiums, their health care. For \nthe very rich, they are going to have to be responsible for more of the \nsubsidy--not all of the Government subsidy for them but more. There is \ncost containment built in. There are disease management programs that \nare going to be part of the traditional Medicare.\n  Quality is going to be rewarded. This is fantastic. I will come back \nto this if I have time. For the first time, the hospitals, for example, \nif they report the quality data, they will get their full, what is \ncalled, market basket update. The important thing is if they don't \nreport that quality data over time, they are not going to get paid as \nmuch. Quality is being rewarded.\n  It is amazing; as a heart specialist, 50 percent of people in this \nbody are going to die of heart disease, probably. It is higher for \nwomen than it is for men. A lot of people don't realize that, in terms \nof morbidity. More women will die of heart disease than men this year.\n  Right now there is no screening test reimbursed. Your cholesterol \nlevel right now, as a screening test, in Medicare is not reimbursed. \nOnce we pass this bill tomorrow, and it is implemented, cholesterol \nscreening and lipid profiles, preventive tests will be reimbursed for \nthe first time. People say, come on; it has got to be reimbursed today. \nIt is not reimbursed today. That is just an example--prevention.\n  As to physical exams, people know that is important as a screening \nmeasure. A lot of people get to 65 years of age and have never had a \nphysical exam. For the first time in Medicare, everybody is going to \nhave available to them, under Medicare, an entry level physical exam. \nBefore, it wasn't there. It is not there today, but it is going to be \nthere under the bill.\n  Information technology, I mention that because it has to do with \nmedical errors. Right now we know there are too many medical errors \nthat are being made. We need to facilitate, and adapt information to \ncome into the system and be handled in a way that is consistent, in \nwhich the data can be assimilated and reported back. There will be e-\nprescribing for prescriptions with incentives--not mandatory, but \nincentives to encourage physicians to be able, instead of writing each \nprescription and have it go through 10 or 15 different hands and come \nback where mistakes can be made, by computer it can go all the way \nthrough the system where the mistakes are less likely to be made.\n  It is a complicated chart, but it gives my colleagues the feel for \neverything that we are accomplishing in this bill--not everything, but \nhow important the various elements of this bill are.\n  Senator Kent Conrad in this body is the person who is probably as \nfocused as anybody on this particular issue. I agree with him 100 \npercent.\n  How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The leader has 5\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. FRIST. Five and a half. OK. I will move fairly quickly.\n  The issue is that most people in Medicare today are not very \nexpensive, in terms of their health care. But 6 percent are.\n  In this body there are 100 people. Not everybody is here right now, \nbut 6 of the 100 people in this body would account for 50 percent of \nall expenditures in Medicare. That is amazing.\n  Wouldn't it be great if you could identify which 6 it is, and if you \nidentified them you could focus resources, coordinate their care, get \npreventive medicine, give them disease management, and that would take \ncare of 50 percent of the cost? In this bill we establish data \ncollection to identify and begin that disease management.\n  This bill is good for doctors and hospitals. Physicians right now, if \nwe don't do anything today, are going to be cut by 4.5 percent, under \ncurrent law, as to what they are reimbursed. When we pass this bill, it \nwill increase, instead of being cut, by 1.5 percent.\n  Hospitals, if they give us the quality data--which they should give \ndo--will get full market basket.\n  Paperwork: You hear physicians all the time, and hospitals, complain \nabout the regulations and the paperwork. We have significant paperwork \nreduction in this bill.\n  Back in Tennessee, the most common request is: What is this bill to \nme? What does it mean to me?\n  To seniors, it means a lot. To individuals with disabilities, it \nmeans a lot. But in addition, the State of Tennessee, above current \nlaw, is going to receive for hospitals, $655 million more; for doctors, \n$240 million more; and for our Medicaid Program, almost $700 million \nmore, because of this bill.\n  We hear regarding prescription drug costs that there is nothing in \nthis bill to control prescription drug costs. That is not true. It is \nsimply not true. I encourage my colleagues to read that bill and \ncontinue to read it tonight.\n  We speed generic drugs to the market. All of us know brand-name drugs \nare expensive. Generic drugs are not very expensive. What we do through \nthis bill and the work of Senator Schumer and the work of Senator Judd \nGregg is speed generics to the market in this bill.\n  We have competition. All the competition, the marketplace dynamics--\ncompetition is the only thing we know that over time can slow the \ngrowth of, whether it is drug prices or any prices. Price fixing simply \ndoes not work. It hasn't worked in Germany, it hasn't worked in \nEngland, and it hasn't worked in this country when we tried it in \nhealth care. I am going to keep moving here.\n  Are we helping the people who need it the most, poor people? The \nanswer is yes. Below 100 percent of the poverty level: If you have $100 \nin monthly drug spending, 95 percent of the cost of drugs is paid for \nthrough this plan.\n\n  Let's take another example. If you are below the poverty level and \nyou have $500 a month in drug spending, you have 97 percent of all of \nthe costs taken care of by this plan; $1,000, you have 98 percent.\n  These are the people who need it the most. This plan is generous to \nthe people who need it the most.\n  In closing, again, I will keep it very short. Hopefully, I can speak \nfor a couple of minutes tomorrow morning.\n  We are providing access to prescription drugs, the most important \ntool in medicine today. Seniors don't have it today. They are going to \nhave it after we pass this bill.\n  This program is voluntary. If you do not want to change anything, if \nyou like what you have today, then keep what you have. Nobody is \nforcing you to choose. All of this is voluntary.\n\n[[Page S15633]]\n\n  Private health plan choices: Why? Because private health plans today \ncapture the advances I showed you earlier--coordinated care, disease \nmanagement, and integrated care. That is what it is in private plans \ntoday that is being denied to our seniors. Seniors don't have access to \nthem.\n  Appropriate reimbursement and regulatory relief to providers, to \ndoctors, to hospitals, to nurses--I just mentioned what the impact is \nfor a State such as Tennessee. Payment linked to quality is not done \ntoday. It is not done today in Medicare. For the first time, \nreimbursement is being linked to quality care.\n  Lastly, preventive care, physical exam for the first time, if we pass \nthis bill; lipid profile; improvement in mammography screening; chronic \ncare management and disease management.\n  I know my time is up. Let me close by saying this bill does four \nthings. It strengthens and improves Medicare; it offers prescription \ndrugs for the first time in the history of our Medicare Program; it \ndoes it on a voluntary basis; and for the first time in the history of \nthis program it gives seniors access to plans that better suit their \nneeds.\n  I encourage every Member in this body to vote for this bill.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, would you notify me when I have 5 minutes \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be notified.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I have been fighting for a real \nprescription drug benefit for years. In the 106th Congress, I helped \ndraft the MEND Act, and year after year I have used my seat on the \nBudget Committee to set aside money for a good drug benefit. I voted \nfor several Medicare prescription drug bills, including S. 1 last June \nand the Graham-Miller-Kennedy bill in the last Congress. I have written \nand I have introduced legislation to make Medicare more fair to the \npeople of my home State of Washington. I have worked to improve health \ncare for seniors on the HELP Committee, on the Labor-HHS appropriations \nsubcommittee, and here on the Senate floor.\n  After all of these years of work, no one wants prescription drug \nbenefits more than I do. But I am very troubled by the proposal that is \nnow before us.\n  I am unhappy at the prospect that this plan could force seniors and \nthe disabled into an overly restrictive health care rationing regime in \nwhich they could lose their choice of doctors just to get a pretty \nmeager drug benefit.\n  I am unhappy at the prospect that this plan could tell our seniors \nthey must give up the good retirement health plan they have worked all \nof their lives to earn.\n  I am unhappy at the prospect that this plan could leave our seniors \nand disabled at the mercy of ever-increasing premiums.\n  I am unhappy at the prospect that this plan could tell patients who \nhave complex medical conditions they cannot get direct access to \nspecialists they need to see.\n  I am unhappy at the prospect that this plan could tell patients with \nMS, or Parkinson's disease, or ALS they can't get the drugs they need \nbecause their plan will not cover them.\n  I am unhappy at the prospect that this plan could tell our rural \nseniors they will have to roll the dice on how they receive health care \ncoverage because this is not a real choice in their communities.\n  I am unhappy at the prospect that this plan would tell disabled \nAmericans who are fighting poverty that the drugs they get today can be \noff limits tomorrow.\n  I am unhappy at the prospect that this plan would tell seniors if \ntheir drugs cost more than $2,300, they won't get a dime of help until \nthey pay $3,600 out of their own pockets.\n  I am unhappy at the prospect that this plan could break the promise \nthat Medicare has had for our seniors and our disabled since 1965.\n  This isn't just about plans and formularies and medical services \nareas; this is about people. It is about our parents and our \ngrandparents and generations of Americans coming behind us.\n  I have sat down with seniors in my State, and I have heard how badly \nthey need a real drug benefit. Just last August, I met with more than \n200 seniors in Edmonds, WA, at the South County Senior Center. They \ntold me in their own words just how important the drug benefit is.\n  During this debate, I have listened to my colleagues. I have listened \nto seniors and the disabled in Washington State. I have heard from \ndoctors and hospitals at home. I have read the key provisions in the \npackage, and I have reviewed the Congressional Budget Office estimates. \nWithout a doubt, this is one of the most complex and controversial \nproposals this Congress has considered.\n\n  One needs only to review what happened in the House a few days ago to \nsee how controversial and political the vote was. What occurred during \nthat vote speaks volumes about the failures of this bill and the \nlengths the majority will go to in order to pass this flawed measure.\n  At the end of the allocated time for that vote in the House, the bill \nhad been rejected. But the majority leadership refused to close that \nvote. They held it open for many more minutes, and those minutes turned \ninto hours, and finally at about 6 o'clock in the morning, after \nholding that vote open for 3 hours, the majority managed to pressure a \nfew Members to switch their votes.\n  An issue this important deserves a thorough debate. I am troubled \nthat it appears as though this bill is being railroaded through \nCongress on twisted arms and backroom pressure.\n  When I look at Social Security and Medicare, I don't just see a \nprogram, I see a promise. It is a promise from one generation to the \nnext. It is a promise from our Government to our seniors. And it is a \npromise that reflects our values.\n  Coupled with Social Security, Medicare is the most important \nantipoverty program ever. In fact, before Medicare, in 1963, 44 percent \nof our seniors were uninsured. Today, it is just 1 percent. In 1966, 29 \npercent of seniors lived in poverty. Today, it is down to about 10 \npercent. Since 1960, life expectancy for those over 65 has increased by \n25 percent.\n  Medicare is a success story. It promised our seniors that they will \nhave health care security, regardless of their ability to pay, \nregardless of where they live, and regardless of their medical \ncondition.\n  Not only has Medicare helped seniors, but it forms the foundation of \nall of our health care. Medicare helps train our doctors. Medicare \npayments help keep our rural hospitals open. And Medicare helps keep \nemergency rooms and neonatal units operating. Medicare is open to every \ndoctor and every hospital. It doesn't force providers into restricted \nnetworks. It lets doctors make decisions based on what their patients \nneed--not on some mandate from some accountant.\n  It is troubling to think of what rural America would be today and \nwhether inner-city trauma centers would even be in existence today \nwithout Medicare.\n  Let us not forget the reason we created Medicare in the first place. \nThe market failed our seniors.\n  I approach this debate with a clear understanding of the importance \nof Medicare to our seniors and to our entire health care system. When I \nlook at this bill, I want to know what it means to the seniors I \nrepresent. So far, I have found five big dangers for Washington State \nseniors.\n  First, this plan jeopardizes the health benefits retirees have earned \nduring their working years. In Washington State, 47,250 seniors could \nlose their retiree health benefits. In return, they get much less \ncoverage and they will pay for more than they had planned.\n  This plan is an unpredictable benefit that requires huge out-of-\npocket costs and has massive gaps in coverage. This bill changes the \nground rules on seniors in the middle of their golden years, and that \nis just not right.\n  Second, seniors could be forced into an overly restrictive health \ncare rationing regime if they want a drug benefit. On paper, it looks \nas if seniors have a choice. That is what the proponents keep \nrepeating. When we take a closer look, we see what is going on. \nSupporters claim that seniors can stay in traditional Medicare, but \nthat is\n\n[[Page S15634]]\n\nonly if insurance companies decide to offer drug-only plans. They could \noffer drug-only plans, but the affordability of those plans is unknown \nand unknowable. That is because there is no limit on how much a plan \ncan charge, so seniors will not be protected from price gouging.\n  On paper it may look as if seniors get a choice, but in reality many \nwill face a new system that rations their health care in exchange for a \nvery small drug benefit. Seniors could get fewer choices and less \ncoverage than they have today. They will face fewer choices because of \nan imposed system of rationing that may not let them pick their own \ndoctor, and they will have less coverage because the plans they will be \nforced into do not need to cover every drug that is medically \nnecessary.\n  Third, if you get a chronic, life-threatening disease such as cancer \nor AIDS, you are not guaranteed the drugs you need. Here is what one \nclient of The Lifelong AIDS Alliance in Washington State had to say:\n\n       The current bill as it is written will affect me personally \n     as it limits the drugs I can have access to because it only \n     allows for up to two drugs under the prescription part of the \n     bill. Since I am on a multiple-drug regimen, I will not have \n     access to the other life-saving drugs that I will have to \n     take to stay HIV healthy.\n\n  Those are the chilling words of one of my constituents who is HIV \npositive and understands what this bill will mean for him. That is why \nAIDS service providers in my State oppose this bill.\n  In addition, if you need access to a clinical trial, forget it. This \nbill does not require any plan to give you access to experimental \ntreatments.\n  This plan will mean fewer choices and less coverage for millions of \nseniors.\n  Fourth, this bill is especially bad for seniors and disabled \nAmericans who are fighting poverty. Today, about 6 million Americans \nare eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid. Through these two \nprograms, they get the coverage for the drugs they need. But this new \nbill we are looking at strips away what is known as wraparound \ncoverage. In Washington State, that means about 92,000 people will get \nless coverage than they have today. That is just in my State. Those are \nthe most vulnerable among us, the very people Medicare and Medicaid \nwere designed to protect.\n  Fifth, there is a huge gap in coverage. Many seniors will see a big \nhole in their coverage. Payments will not stop. What you have to pay \nwill not stop, but your coverage will. If your drugs cost you more than \n$2,250 a year, you will get zero help until you spend a total of $3,600 \nout of your own pocket. You get no coverage, but you still have to pay \nthe premium.\n  When you look at what the average Medicare beneficiary spends for \ndrugs, this coverage gap gets even worse. According to the Kaiser \nFamily Foundation, in 2003, the average Medicare beneficiary paid \n$2,322 for prescription drugs. If you spend the average, you are \nalready in the coverage gap. Those figures were included in the Los \nAngeles Times article that appeared in the Seattle Times on November \n21. They show that the average senior will end up with a gap in \ncoverage from which few seniors will ever emerge.\n\n  When I ask, what does this bill mean for the seniors I represent, I \nam pretty troubled by the answers. I am troubled this could force \n47,000 seniors in Washington State to give up the retiree health \nbenefits they have worked for their entire lives. I am troubled this \ncould force seniors in Washington State into overly restrictive health \ncare rationing, to get a limited drug benefit and to lose their choice \nof doctor. I am troubled this could force patients with cancer, AIDS, \nand other life-threatening diseases into a system that will deny them \nthe drugs they need. I am troubled this could force 92,000 low-income \nseniors or disabled Washingtonians out of Medicaid into a market where \nthey lose access to the drugs they get today. I am troubled this could \nforce millions of seniors into a coverage gap where they have to spend \nmore than $3,600 out of their own pocket without getting coverage or \nbenefits.\n  This bill is also bad for Washington State in seven ways:\n  It could result in unequal benefits throughout Washington.\n  It could force providers and seniors to reevaluate their \nparticipation every single year, and they will get very little in \nreturn for that added unpredictability.\n  It could encourage seniors who are healthier and financially secure \nto leave traditional Medicare.\n  It could undermine Medicaid in Washington State.\n  It could require my State to send to the Federal Government a very \nlarge chunk of the savings it realizes.\n  It could force Washington State to manage new bureaucracies to test \nthe assets of seniors in my home State.\n  And it could put Washington State even further down the list in \nMedicare reimbursements per beneficiary.\n  Let me walk through how this program would work to show how it is bad \nfor my home State. Under this plan, the country will be divided into as \nmany as 50 regions. States such as Washington could be divided into as \nmany as three regions. Within these new, undefined regions, private \ninsurance plans would be able to run the Medicare Program--not just the \ndrug benefit, but Part A and Part B of the Medicare Program as well.\n  Washington State will be an attractive market for the PPOs and HMOs \nbecause we have areas that are healthier and wealthier and a tradition \nof health care delivery.\n  Currently, Washington State has one of the highest Medicare+Choice \nparticipation rates in the country with 18 percent of Medicare \nbeneficiaries receiving Medicare through a Medicare+Choice plan.\n  Washington State also has a long tradition of managed and efficient \ncare, so we will be a prime target for the new PPOs and HMOs. That \nmeans Medicare benefits in my State, just within my State, will vary \nfrom region to region and county to county depending on where you live. \nIn theory, seniors in my home State may have more choices, but they \ngive up a guarantee of a defined benefit.\n  Providers in Washington State could also face the same changes and \nuncertainty. Every year, seniors in Washington State would have to \nevaluate each insurance plan to find the one that best meets their \nneeds.\n  Here are some of the things seniors every year in my State will have \nto figure out. While not knowing what medical conditions they may \nconfront, they will have to figure out how much they have to pay out of \npocket. Without knowing what their future holds, they will have to \npredict what providers they will be able to see. Without knowing, they \nwill have to figure out what doctors have dropped out of their plan or \nmay drop out, what restrictions will be on drug coverage, what their \ncopayments will be, what plan formulary includes expensive new drugs, \nwhat hospitals are in their network.\n\n  That is an awful lot to figure out, especially since health plans, as \nwe all know, are never written in plain English and no one knows what \nmedical conditions they may confront in their future.\n  Today, Medicare provides predictability. An 85-year-old woman in her \nhome knows what Medicare provides. Under the Medicare+Choice plan, \nseniors got more than they gave up.\n  I do want to state there have been some managed care success stories \nin my home State. We have some great providers in Washington State that \nled the way in providing innovative, comprehensive care that puts the \nfocus on patients, not profits. But overall, we need to think how this \nplan would expand the Medicare+Choice model.\n  Medicare+Choice has worked only in limited parts of Washington State. \nA total of 131,391 seniors in Washington State participate in these \nplans. But they are not open to all seniors and they are limited to a \nvery few select regions. Even in this limited program, we have seen \nsignificant changes and instability just within Washington State. I am \nnot at all convinced this is a model we should now expand for all \nseniors and disabled.\n  If these new plans that are coming in attract higher income, \nhealthier seniors, we need to ask, what will be left of traditional \nMedicare? I am afraid traditional Medicare will begin to look more and \nmore like Medicaid.\n  The prospects for this plan are deeply troubling. They could have a \nmassive financial impact on Washington State.\n  I will turn to how this plan will affect Washington State and its \nMedicaid Program.\n\n[[Page S15635]]\n\n  I received a letter from the Democratic Governors' Association. It is \nsigned by three Governors, including Governor Locke of Washington.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letter be printed in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the Governors' letter urges Congress to \ngive the States time to determine the impact on their Medicaid programs \nbefore enacting sweeping changes in how we treat Medicaid beneficiaries \nand how States pay for coverage for low-income seniors and the \ndisabled.\n  So under this plan, if States save money by shifting drug costs from \nMedicaid to Medicare, States have to give a portion of those savings \nthat they get back to the Federal Government every year.\n  Many States, such as Washington, have stepped up to the plate and \nhave tried to fill the gap in Medicare by providing affordable, \ncomprehensive prescription drug coverage through Medicaid for people \nwho are eligible for both programs.\n  Over the past 10 years, as drug costs have rapidly increased, this \nburden has become overwhelming. Many States are now being forced to \nscale back their coverage in access.\n  In 2002, Washington State spent an estimated $212.8 million on drug \ncosts for people who are eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid. That \nwas a huge strain on my State.\n  Under this plan we are considering, the States will see some relief \nby shifting Medicaid beneficiaries to Medicare for drug coverage. But, \nunfortunately, the plan gives with one hand and takes back with the \nother.\n  Washington State, under this plan, will be forced to surrender much \nof the savings it sees back to the Federal Government. That could \nreduce Washington State's Federal Medicaid dollars by almost $2 billion \nfrom 2006 to 2013. That could devastate the entire program and result \nin further Medicaid reductions for low-income children and families. It \ncould force the State to again implement reductions in provider \npayments for doctors, hospitals, and nursing homes.\n  A $2 billion give-back, just for my State, will mean more uninsured, \nlower provider payments, and more children losing any health care \nsafety net they have today.\n  Let's not forget that States will be handed a massive new \nadministration burden under this plan. Washington State will now have \nto administer new asset tests to determine who qualifies under Medicare \nfor low-income assistance. These tests are extremely restrictive and \nwill result in many low-income seniors being pushed into higher income \ncategories.\n  Under the conference agreement, assets will be limited to $6,000 for \na single person and $9,000 for a married couple.\n  In order to get any additional financial assistance under this plan, \nmany seniors and the disabled will be forced to impoverish themselves \nand give up almost everything they have worked so hard to earn. Even if \nthe States want to provide a more humane benefit or assistance, they \nwill not be allowed to do so.\n  Now, many of us fought to provide relief to States just this year by \ntemporarily increasing the Federal Medicaid match. This was a \ncritically important fight to save Medicaid and prevent massive \nMedicaid cuts on doctors and hospitals. Our success in achieving a \nsmall measure of relief is now being undone by imposing an even greater \nburden on the States.\n\n  Finally, Mr. President, this bill will punish Washington State even \nfurther in Medicare payments. For several years, I have been working to \naddress the geographic disparities that punish providers and seniors in \nmy State of Washington. For years, Washington State has received unfair \ntreatment.\n  Today, Washington State ranks 41st in the Nation in Medicare payments \nper beneficiary. We are being penalized because we have a tradition of \nlow-cost, efficient health care, and healthy seniors. Medicare should \nreward that. Instead, its outdated reimbursement formulas are causing \ndoctors to leave my State or close their practices to new Medicare \npatients.\n  I have spoken at great length on the Senate floor before about this, \nand I have introduced legislation to correct that inequity. But under \nthis bill, the situation would be even worse.\n  Washington State would fall from 41st in the Nation to 45th in the \nNation. Even though there will be a slight increase in payments to \nWashington, because of what happens to other States, we end up falling \neven further behind. This is a fundamental shift in the Medicare \nentitlement, in exchange for a very weak benefit.\n  Philosophically, this plan goes in the wrong direction. We should be \nstrengthening the foundation of Medicare, not experimenting with \nimposing a new health care system on seniors.\n  This plan undermines the role of the Federal Government in ensuring \nthat every senior can live with the dignity and respect and stability \nthey deserve. It could force seniors into an overly restrictive, ever-\nchanging health system.\n  Let's not forget why Medicare was enacted in the first place. It was \ncreated because the private insurance market failed seniors and the \ndisabled. Coverage was sporadic, expensive, and unpredictable. \nMedicare, when it was enacted, changed all of that for our Nation's \nseniors. Now I am afraid we are flirting with that original failed \nmodel. I believe we can do better.\n  During my time in the Senate, I have been proud to work on \nprescription drug coverage--from helping to draft the MEND Act in the \n106th Congress to working on the Budget Committee over the past 4 years \nto fund prescription drugs.\n  I was proud to support the Graham-Miller-Kennedy bill in the 107th \nCongress that would have provided an affordable, reliable, \ncomprehensive prescription drug benefit as part of Medicare. We had a \nchance to do much better.\n  I believe a prescription drug benefit ought to be a seamless part of \nMedicare. It should be treated just like a doctor's office visit or an \noutpatient surgical procedure.\n  By implementing a seamless, affordable benefit as part of Medicare, \nas we did when we added the Part B benefit, we would guarantee that all \nseniors have access to the same level of care, regardless of their \nhealth status or their age or their income or their assets or where \nthey live. That access would be stable, and it would be predictable.\n  I know we can do this. Many of us in this Chamber, on both sides of \nthe aisle, have worked to significantly boost our investment in NIH \nfunding. We have fought to reform and modernize the FDA to ensure \ntimely approval of new, lifesaving drugs. I want all of my seniors and \ndisabled constituents to benefit from those kinds of investments.\n  Under the plan before us today, I cannot be sure they will reap the \nrewards of this Federal investment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grassley). The Chair is responding to the \nrequest that the Senator be notified when she has 5 minutes left.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, we should be on the floor today debating a \nprescription drug benefit package, not a proposal to radically alter \nMedicare. This should be a fight about providing good, affordable, \nstable coverage, not about experimenting with Medicare.\n  I do want to thank my friend and colleague, Senator Baucus, for his \nefforts. I know he worked hard to do the best he could. Senator Baucus \nunderstands the importance of Medicare for seniors and the disabled, \nand I know he fought against incredible odds. He was sitting across the \ntable from Members of Congress who tried before to privatize Medicare, \nand many who still hope to turn Social Security over to Wall Street. He \nfaced an impossible task.\n  I know he did all he could, and I thank him for his fight.\n  Mr. President, I do want to note there are some things in this bill \nthat I fought for that are important.\n  It does prevent additional cuts in payments to doctors who are \nscheduled to take effect early next year. The scheduled reduction of \n4.5 percent, as we all know, is unacceptable. I worked hard to prevent \nthat scheduled reduction of 4 percent in 2003, and I do applaud the \nconferees for meeting our demands on this issue.\n  The package also provides additional relief for rural hospitals, home \nhealth care agencies, and rural health care providers. This relief is \ntruly a life line\n\n[[Page S15636]]\n\nfor saving rural health care. I have always supported these provisions, \nand I will continue to fight for fair and equitable rural payments.\n  I can promise health care providers and patients in my home State \nthat regardless of the outcome of this legislation, I remain committed \nto stabilizing Medicare payments.\n  Now, Mr. President, I know many organizations representing doctors \nand hospitals think we can come back in 2006 and correct the mechanisms \nin this bill that undermine Medicare. That is a pretty dangerous \ngamble. Not only that, but we don't know what the people who put this \nbill together will demand down the road in exchange for changes--\npremiums support or vouchers for States; larger gaps in coverage; more \ncopayments; more restrictions on access; more deals on the House floor \nin the middle of the night?\n  We do not know what the pricetag will be to undo the damage that this \nbill will impose. I assure everyone, it will not be easy.\n  I had looked forward to the day when the Senate would pass a Medicare \nprescription drug benefit. That day is upon us, but I believe that the \nprice of this benefit is far too high.\n  In the coming months and years we will see the theory behind this \nbill put to practice. As more and more people discover what this bill \nand this President have done to their health care, I am confident we \nwill hear from seniors as we have never heard before.\n  This is a difficult decision. The $400 billion in this bill does \nrepresent a step forward. The provider payments contained in this bill \nare needed in my State, and seniors deserve the prescription drug \ncoverage they have been asking for. Passage of this bill and being \nsigned into law is not the end of the story. A tremendous amount of \nwork will be required to fix the deficiencies in this bill. I will be \nthere, as I have been all these years, working the best I can to do the \nright thing for the people I represent in my State and the people \nacross this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                            Democratic Governors' Association,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 21, 2003.\n     Members of the U.S. Senate,\n     U.S. Capitol,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: As you know, the near 700-page Medicare \n     reform bill was unveiled yesterday. As a consequence, states \n     have not thoroughly reviewed the language or seen individual \n     cost estimates needed to make an accurate determination of \n     its benefits and/or costs. Late yesterday, the Congressional \n     Budget Office (CBO) released numbers portraying a net savings \n     to states of $17 billion over ten years. Notwithstanding this \n     projected rosy scenario, neither CBO, nor any other \n     independent entity has completed a state-by-state impact \n     analysis of this legislation. Even CBO is projecting that \n     states will be $900 million in the red in the first year of \n     the Medicare's program implementation in 2006. States need to \n     ensure that their reading of the legislation confirms that \n     the projected new state costs have not been underestimated by \n     CBO.\n       With this in mind, we urge you to reject any effort to vote \n     on this legislation before you know its full content and cost \n     impact on your state and the people we both serve. To this \n     end, CBO estimates on Medicare reform impact and expedited \n     state reviews of the direct and indirect cost/savings impact \n     from this legislation must be done and fully disseminated. \n     Any rush to judgment, without this information, may have both \n     short and long-term consequences that could prove to be \n     irrevocably severe.\n        Early in the deliberations of the Medicare reform \n     conference, governors were advised that at a minimum, the \n     conferees were committed to ensuring that states would face \n     no new costs as a consequence of the Medicare Prescription \n     Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003. This \n     commitment was made for each and every state, for each and \n     every year, of the ten-year budget. For this reason, we are \n     writing to urge you to not vote on this legislation until it \n     is absolutely clear that this assurance has been upheld.\n        In recent days, there have been reports that the new \n     administrative and other indirect state costs of this \n     program--combined with the bill's exceedingly high ``claw-\n     back'' of state savings--would more than exceed any Medicare \n     savings for many states. Such an unacceptable outcome would \n     be in addition to another misguided policy, reportedly \n     seeking to mandate states and the territories to permanently \n     pay 75 percent of the current Federal prescription drug cost-\n     shift to states. In 2006, the first year of the bill's \n     enactment, states would have to pay 90 percent of these \n     costs.\n        Some have already suggested that this is a poorly crafted \n     bill and in the long run it would do more harm than good to \n     the very population it was intended to benefit. Although some \n     states are witnessing a small increase in revenues, most \n     states will continue to experience budget shortfalls for the \n     current fiscal year. Some analysts believe that the overall \n     shortfall will likely be $25 to $40 billion. With the \n     continued sluggish growth in state revenues, any increases in \n     state costs imposed by this legislation would be yet another \n     unfunded federal mandate, creating additional pressure on \n     states to cut essential programs and/or raise taxes.\n        Similarly, any permanent continuation of the Federal \n     government's prescription drug cost-shift to states runs \n     counter to existing National Governors Association (NGA) \n     policy that, ``if Congress decides to expand prescription \n     drug coverage to seniors, it should not shift that \n     responsibility or its costs to the states and territories'' \n     and establishes a damaging precedent.\n           Sincerely,\n     Gov. Gary Locke,\n                                            Washington, DGA Chair.\n     Gov. Tom Vilsack,\n                                             Iowa, DGA Vice-Chair.\n     Gov. Bill Richardson,\n                                  New Mexico, DGA Federal Liaison.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, as we all know by now, the Medicare \nconferees have reached agreement on the most significant changes to the \nMedicare Program in history. I thank the Presiding Officer for the \nhours he has spent working on this, the agony he has gone through at \nunderstanding and reaching agreement with this diverse body of \nSenators. There are 100 of us. We usually amount to probably 150 \nopinions on anything. The Chair has had to put all of that together \ninto a bill that not only the 100 Senators agree with--and not all 100 \nSenators do--as many of the Senators as possible, and as many of the \nHouse as possible, because a bill to go through to the President has to \npass both the House and the Senate. When it gets this complicated, it \nis an extremely talented person who is able to put together the kind of \nlegislation that reaches a compromise that will be able to pass.\n  This is a copy of the bill. If anybody thinks it is simple, they \nhaven't looked at it. It takes a long time to wander through this. We \nhave been working on it for a few days and now have the finalized copy, \nthe copy that has passed the House. It is the most significant change \nin the history of Medicare. It may be the most significant change in \nmedical delivery in the history of the world.\n  I congratulate the Presiding Officer, the Senator from Iowa, Mr. \nGrassley, for all the hard work he put in on this bill. We will soon be \nvoting on it.\n  This bill will add a prescription drug benefit to Medicare, it will \noffer new Medicare coverage options to seniors, and it will expand tax \nincentives for people who save money to pay for their own health care \nneeds. That is quite a package.\n  I want to strengthen Medicare. Seniors and disabled people in Wyoming \ndepend upon Medicare to pay for their health care needs. We have \nrelatively few major employers in Wyoming so most of our retired \nseniors don't have access to health care coverage through their former \nemployers. Medicare is critical to the health and well-being of 66,000 \nelderly and disabled citizens in my home State. That may not sound like \na lot of people, but it is over 13 percent of Wyoming's population.\n  Adding a prescription drug benefit to Medicare makes sense. Medicare \nis the only traditional insurance plan in the United States that does \nnot cover outpatient prescription drugs. The reason Medicare does not \ncover prescription medications is that pharmaceuticals were not a major \npart of medical care in the 1960s, when Medicare was founded. It is a \ndifferent story today. Today, prescription drugs are absolutely \nintegral to providing quality health care. All of us rely on them. It \nmakes sense for Medicare to keep up with the times by offering \nvoluntary prescription drug coverage to seniors.\n  Let me emphasize the voluntary nature of this program some more. We \nhave heard that the AARP is going to regret supporting this Medicare \nbill just as they regretted supporting the catastrophic coverage bill \nof the 1980s. I will come back to that a little bit later. The reason \nseniors revolted against the catastrophic coverage bill back then was \nthat it was mandatory. They didn't have a choice. They had to pay for \nthe coverage even if they didn't want it.\n  This bill does not make that mistake. This bill is different. If \nseniors\n\n[[Page S15637]]\n\ndon't want Medicare drug coverage, they don't have to pay for it. If \nthey have coverage through their former employer, they can keep that. \nPlus we provide a lot of support in this bill for employers to continue \nproviding their retirees with drug coverage so that seniors won't be \nforced to buy a Medicare drug plan because they lost their retiree \ncoverage. So this is indeed a voluntary program.\n\n  It gives seniors a chance to sign up for Medicare drug coverage or \nstay in the traditional Medicare and keep what they have. Choice is a \ngreat concept. America was built on the idea that people should have \nthe freedom to choose how to live their lives, as long as their choices \ndon't infringe on the freedom of others.\n  When it comes to health care, choice is also important. Today seniors \ndon't have choices. Medicare is a one-size-fits-all program, take it or \nleave it. But we all know that most seniors cannot afford to leave it. \nSo right now they are stuck with Medicare, warts and all. The fact that \nCongress has to pass a law to add a prescription drug benefit is part \nof the problem with the Medicare system. Medicare is not flexible \nenough to adjust and adapt to the complex nature of health care today.\n  As I have noted, prescription drugs play a much greater role in \ntreating disease today than they did when Medicare was created nearly \nfour decades ago. But unlike private health plans, Medicare has not \nchanged with the times. Under this Medicare agreement, seniors will \nhave the option to choose drug coverage through Medicare. They will \nalso have options that go beyond voluntary drug coverage.\n  The conference agreement would allow a variety of private health \nplans to offer coverage of Medicare beneficiaries. I am not talking \nabout HMOs. Despite what I have heard here on the Senate floor, this \nbill does not force seniors and disabled into HMOs. Medicare HMOs exist \ntoday, and no one is being forced into them. What this bill does is \nallow preferred provider organizations, or PPOs, to offer Medicare \nplans.\n  Most of us are familiar with PPOs. They are the type of health plans \nto which more Americans belong than any other type. HMOs give you a \nlist of doctors. If your doctor is not on the list, you can't visit \nhim. The great thing about PPOs is, you can use any doctor you choose. \nAnd if the doctor is part of the plan's network, you get a discount on \nthe cost of his or her services. These private PPO plans will compete \nto serve seniors by offering new choices and benefits, choices that are \ncurrently unavailable under Medicare's one-size-fits-all structure.\n  To be blunt, I believe the legislation could be bolder in stimulating \ncompetition. But it represents a good step in the direction of \nflexibility, innovation, and here is that word again--choice.\n  Let's be clear on what the Medicare bill would do. It would offer \nsecurity to seniors who are without drug coverage. It would provide \nincentives to employers to encourage them to maintain the coverage they \nprovide to their retirees. At the same time, the bill would create new \nMedicare options for seniors. It also would create incentives for \nprivate health plans to innovate and compete for the businesses of \ntoday's seniors and invigorate the Medicare Program for future \ngenerations.\n  Let's also be clear on what the bill won't do. It won't force seniors \nand the disabled to pay for a Medicare drug benefit if they don't want \nit. It won't encourage employers to drop drug coverage for their \nretirees. It won't force seniors and the disabled into HMOs.\n  I should also point out that the Medicare bill won't pay for every \ndollar of a senior's prescription drug costs. A drug benefit for needy \nseniors is important, but it is also important that we preserve \nMedicare for future generations. Already 30 percent of Medicare funding \ncomes from the general government revenues. Projected expenditures are \nexpected to exceed projected tax and premium revenues after 2015. I \nwill be keeping a careful eye on Medicare spending, especially now that \nwe have passed this drug benefit. If we are going to add anything new \nto Medicare beyond a basic and sensible drug benefit, we need to pay \nfor it directly.\n  This drug benefit isn't free, but it is responsible. We set aside \n$400 billion of the Federal budget over the next 10 years to pay for \nthis benefit. That is how much the agreement is projected to cost. \nActually, it comes in slightly under that. But last year when we were \ndoing the appropriations, we set aside the $400 billion. Some people \nsay $400 billion is not enough. They point out that seniors are \nexpected to spend $1.8 trillion on prescription drugs over the next 10 \nyears.\n  Well, nothing in life is truly free, and prescription drugs will not \nbe an exception. We need to remember that every new Federal program \ncomes at a price. We need to be aware of just what that price is when \nwe ask for a new program. It is not always the people receiving the \nbenefit that are paying the benefit. The $400 billion is the equivalent \nof $1,600 from every taxpayer over that 10-year period. What would \ntaxpayers say about the need for any program if we put it into that \nkind of a form for them? There would be increased concern just like \nthere is increased concern when people have to pay their own costs of \nmedical treatment.\n  That is how the competition comes into the market. I suppose we could \nhave passed a $1.8 trillion drug benefit. Of course, we would have had \nto raise taxes by $1.4 trillion to do it. I cannot speak for the rest \nof my colleagues, but I just became a grandfather this year and I am \nnot willing to put that kind of a tax burden on my grandson.\n  Even the critics of this agreement acknowledge that low-income \nseniors would be eligible for substantial subsidies for their \nprescription drugs. Even the critics admit that seniors with \ncatastrophic drug expenditures get measurable relief under this bill. \nThere is a generous 95 percent coverage of a seniors' drug cost over \n$5,000.\n  This bill also includes important projections for which I fought on \nthe Senate floor this summer, which protect every senior's right to \nvisit their community pharmacy and receive the high level of service \nthey are accustomed to receiving from them. We have put a huge burden \non our pharmacists in this country, the local ones that are right there \nto answer your questions face to face. There is a provision in the bill \nthat will help to keep that local pharmacist in place and operating. It \ngives them an equal chance under the bill to be providing prescription \ndrugs for seniors on Medicare. It is important that we keep those small \nbusinesses and pharmacists--local people that you can talk to--in \nplace.\n  This bill doesn't cover every dollar of every prescription for every \nsenior. But that is not a reasonable expectation. What this bill does \nis provide help and protection for the two groups that need it the \nmost--those who can least afford prescription drugs, and those who \notherwise would be bankrupted by a serious illness that requires \nexpensive drug therapies. These are worthy objectives and this \nagreement accomplishes those goals.\n  I want to discuss a couple of other aspects of this agreement. First, \nthe bipartisan Medicare agreement would establish health savings \naccounts, HSAs. These HSAs are tax advantaged savings accounts that all \npeople could use to pay for medical expenses. This is a huge \nadvancement in taking care of the uninsured. Health savings accounts \nwould be open to everybody with a high deductible health insurance \nplan. The higher the deductible, the less the cost to the insurance \nplan. The higher the deductible, the more a person is allowed to put \ninto a HSA. Employers would also be able to contribute to the \nemployee's health savings account, and neither the employer's nor the \nemployee's contribution would be taxable. Tax free, you can set up this \naccount.\n  If you have an HSA, your total yearly contributions to it would be as \nlarge as your health insurance plan deductible. Just like an individual \nretirement account, the interest and investment earnings your health \nsavings account would generate are not taxable. Furthermore, the money \nyou take out of HSAs to pay for medical costs are not taxable, as long \nas the money is used to pay for health care expenses. Let's see, you \ndon't pay taxes on it when you put it in, you don't pay taxes on the \nearnings, and you don't pay taxes when you take it out. It is a little \nincentive to put away money to cover deductibles, or anything to do \nwith health care later on. I hope that every young person in this \ncountry will establish a health savings account. No matter what their \nincome level is, no\n\n[[Page S15638]]\n\nmatter how good their health is, it is an opportunity to put away money \nfor when the health is not as good, and to take care of any deductibles \nthat are necessary at any point in life with an insurance plan. It is \nan opportunity to be insured from the time you enter the job market, \nand to put a little away and perhaps have a lot for the years when 50 \nto 80 percent of the health care costs come up.\n\n  One of the best features of health savings accounts is they would be \nportable. That means that if you change jobs, the health savings \naccount goes with you, you still have it. It is yours. Health savings \naccounts are a great innovation. Health savings accounts create a tax \nincentive for everybody--not just seniors--to save for health care \nexpenses, plus it doesn't matter whether your employer offers health \ninsurance or not; you can still save money in a health savings account \nand receive the tax benefit. This provides some tax fairness for those \nof you who don't have access to tax advantages of the employer-\nsponsored health insurance. Let me say that again. This provides some \ntax fairness to those who don't have access to the tax advantage of \nemployer-sponsored health insurance. Employer-sponsored health \ninsurance is tax free. It doesn't even show up on anything that you \nhave to file. This would give the average person the same opportunity \nto have tax-free health coverage.\n  Health savings accounts are an idea whose time has come. Giving \npeople more flexibility and responsibility in their health care \nspending will result in healthier and wiser consumers. I wholeheartedly \nsupport this part of the Medicare agreement. It is long overdue. It \nneeds to be advertised. Young people of this country need to understand \nthat that is their part of Medicare, that they can get into this now \nand it will save them costs later. It will be a part that will shore up \nthe system.\n  I also want to speak to the provisions that would address a very sore \nsubject on the frontier, the inequity in Medicare reimbursement between \nurban and rural areas. I am pleased that the conference agreement \nensures reimbursement equity to doctors, hospitals, and other providers \nof health care in Wyoming and other rural States.\n  Right now, Medicare underpays rural hospitals, home health alleges, \nand other providers, as compared to urban counterparts. This limits the \nability of these providers to maintain their services and their \ninfrastructures and to recruit qualified personnel.\n  Some people do not understand the challenges that rural health care \nproviders face in providing quality care to seniors and the disabled. \nFor instance, I read a column in the Washington Post last Friday by a \ngentleman named Steven Pearlstein. I think it was supposed to be a \nsemi-humorous column--I hope so--although it was in the business \nsection. Well, to those of us in rural areas, it wasn't even semi-\nhumorous, and it wasn't accurate either. I suppose I could ask that \nthis column be printed in the Congressional Record, but I would not \nwant to waste the space. I will, however, cite a paragraph from the \ncolumn in which this gentleman called politicians from rural States \n``nothing more than welfare queens in overalls.'' At this point, I'll \nstate that I still believe Senators ought to be able to bring laptops \nonto the floor. But I assure my colleagues I will not be petitioning \nthem to wear overalls on the Senate floor.\n\n  Let me read one of the paragraphs that Mr. Pearlstein wrote:\n\n       Then there is Medicare bill, which was supposed to be about \n     providing drug benefits to seniors, but wound up being yet \n     another chance to whine about the plight of country doctors \n     and hospitals. Although the cost to providing medical service \n     is actually lower out there in God's country [the God's \n     country is true] that hasn't stopped your guys from squeezing \n     $25 billion more from the Federal Treasury over the next \n     decade to pad Medicare payments to rural providers.\n\n  I don't know if this gentleman has ever been to God's country or not. \nMaybe he has flown over God's country, Mr. President. I doubt he has \never visited the Niobrara Health and Life Center, a very small hospital \nin Lusk, WY. Lusk has a population of 1,500. Lusk is the county seat \nNiobrara County, population 2,500. That is Wyoming's least populated \ncounty. Incidentally, it is a little bigger than the State of Delaware. \nIt has one person for every 524 acres of land.\n  The hospital in Lusk has been closed since May of 2000. Since then, \nfolks in Niobrara have had to travel to Douglas and Torrington for \nsurgery or other hospital care. Douglas and Torrington are in different \ndirections from Lusk. They are both about 55 miles from Lusk. That is a \nlong drive any time, but in winter--and we are having winter there now. \nI don't know if you saw pictures of the Bronco football game where they \nwere scraping snow off of the field; but yesterday there was a blizzard \nin Colorado and in Wyoming, and the temperatures were about 16 degrees, \nand it gets a little tough to get around, if you can at all.\n  Fifty-five miles is a long drive in winter when the winds are howling \nand the snow blows across two-lane roads. That is an important hospital \nfor the people of Niobrara County, and they are getting ready to reopen \nit. They are hoping to be able to afford it. It is also important for \nthe State of Wyoming because there is a State prison for women in Lusk. \nThe State tried to keep the hospital open in the 1990s, but the \nfinancial pressures were simply too great.\n  Hospitals across rural America are struggling, particularly the \nsmallest hospitals, such as the one in Lusk. If it were really true \nthat the ``cost of providing medical service was actually lower out \nthere in God's country'' then why are the rural hospitals struggling to \nstay open?\n  Our Federal Government's own Medicare Payment Advisory Commission \npublished a report in 2001 on Medicare in rural America. That report \nfound that the Medicare ``payment system does not recognize factors \nthat have a greater effect on the cost of rural hospitals.'' The study \nalso found that there are aspects of Medicare's prospective payment \nsystem for inpatient hospital care that tend to work against rural \nhospitals.\n  Every hospital has to buy a certain amount of medical equipment from \nhospital beds to x-ray machines. If rural hospitals get a rural \ndiscount on this equipment, it is news to me. In fact, I think there \nare probably some quantity discounts on which they lose out.\n  Rural hospitals also have to hire nurses and technicians, just as \nurban hospitals. It is hard enough to recruit nurses because we have a \nnationwide shortage. Trying to recruit nurses to come to the Wyoming \nfrontier is even harder. So our rural hospitals have to offer a \ncompetitive wage.\n  Most rural hospitals also have a low patient volume compared to their \nurban counterparts, and this contributes to a higher cost of rural \nhospital care. There is a certain amount of staff and everything that \nhas to be on hand ready for patients if they show up.\n  As the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission rightly points out in its \nstudy, hospitals in small and isolated communities ``cannot achieve the \neconomies of scale and service scope of their larger counterparts and \nthus have higher per-case costs.'' The current Medicare rates do not \ndirectly account for the relationship between cost and volume, \npotentially placing smaller providers at a financial disadvantage \nrelative to the other facilities.\n  I am pleased to note that the Lusk hospital is scheduled to reopen in \nOctober 2004 after completing some important upgrades and renovations. \nI am confident the hospital will be able to survive this time because \nCongress passed a law in 1997 to allow for special payments to \nhospitals in rural areas that are too sparsely populated to support a \nfull-service facility.\n  The Medicare conference agreement would increase payments over the \n1997 law to critical access hospitals, such as the one in Lusk. Despite \nMr. Pearlstein's criticisms, he ignored the fact that urban hospitals \nhave higher Medicare margins than rural hospitals.\n  The additional support for rural health care providers in this bill \nwill help close the gap between higher Medicare margins of urban \nhospitals and the lower Medicare margins of the rural hospitals. This \nadditional help will not come a moment too soon for the people of \nNiobrara County, WY, and other counties in Wyoming and other counties \nthroughout the United States. I hope Mr. Pearlstein will visit Lusk if \nhe ever visits Wyoming. I have been there, and I can tell you that the \nMedicare payments he considers ``padding'' are critical to the hospital \nin\n\n[[Page S15639]]\n\nLusk and to the seniors who depend on it.\n\n  It is a long drive to Lusk from Yellowstone National Park or skiing \nin Jackson Hole, but I think it would be quite educational for him or \nanyone else who makes the journey.\n  There are a lot of good aspects about this Medicare agreement. Adding \na prescription drug benefit to the program is good. Providing seniors \nand the disabled with new Medicare options is good. Offering all \nAmericans new ways to save money for their health care expenses is \ngood. Providing fair Medicare payments to rural doctors and hospitals \nis good. Having health savings accounts is outstanding.\n  For these reasons, I am going to vote for this bipartisan Medicare \nagreement, and I am going to work in the future to ensure that Medicare \ncontinues to offer a reasonable drug benefit for many of America's \nseniors, but one that does not place a huge financial burden on future \ngenerations.\n  Earlier the majority leader, Senator Frist from Tennessee, the only \ndoctor in this body, gave an outstanding speech outlining the reasons \nthat in a bipartisan way he and others have worked on this for 6 years \nto bring this to fruition. A person from the other side of the aisle \nwho has worked on that for 6 years has been Senator Breaux from \nLouisiana. They served on a special task force to come up with a way to \nmake Medicare be solvent for generations to come. This will be the \nfirst significant piece of legislation to address what they have talked \nabout for 6 years.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming has 4 minutes 15 \nseconds remaining.\n  Mr. ENZI. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, in the Senator's remarks he did point out there have \nbeen a lot of health care advances. Science has played a great part in \nhealth from genetically engineered vaccines, to coronary angioplasties, \nto heart transplants, to the human genome project that is coming up \nwith a lot of new medicines that will take care of us. That project, \nincidentally, came in 2 years ahead of time, in 2003, and has led to a \nmassive increase in the number of projects that are being done to come \nup with new drugs that will help us.\n  This is the way Medicare has advanced. It is pretty inflexible. There \nhas not been much advancement. We have an opportunity to correct that \nright now. We need to get the flexibility of Medicare to increase the \nsame way that medical advances are increasing, and those are mostly in \nthe area of prescription drugs. So it is time we added a prescription \ndrug benefit.\n  The bill also takes care of some problems we have with Medicare. I \nmentioned this task force that Senator Breaux and Senator Frist were \non. The task force recognized the problem that when Medicare got \nunderway, there were 20.4 million people under Medicare. Today there \nare 40.8 million people under Medicare. That is a doubling. By 2030, \n77.6 million people will be under Medicare. That is another doubling. \nThat is a huge increase in the number of people who will come under \nMedicare.\n  How is it paid for? It is paid for by people who are in the \nworkforce, not the people who are retired--the people in the workforce.\n  In 1973, there were 7.3 people. That tenth of a person probably \ndidn't feel too well. But 7.3 people were paying for every person under \nMedicare. In the year 2000, there were 3.9 people paying the bill for \nthose in Medicare. By the year 2030, 2.4 people per person will be \npaying the bill for those on Medicare. These people have to pick up the \ncosts of all of Medicare for those people. So it is important we have \nsome cost containment, that we put in some reforms to make sure the \nsystem is available for those 77 million people in the year 2030.\n  Prescription drugs are the most important treatment factor now. They \nwere not in 1965. We have come a long way on the issue of prescription \ndrugs. This is where we are headed. These are the number of drugs in \nclinical development: Cancer, 402 different kinds in clinical \ndevelopment. The percentage of drugs that actual make it is very small. \nIs there a high cost to develop a drug? Yes. Diabetes, there are 30 \ndifferent kinds of medicines; rheumatoid arthritis, 24; osteoporosis, \n20; obesity, overweight, 29; depression 19; congestive heart failure, \n18; Alzheimer's disease, 17; schizophrenia, 16; hypertension, 11; \nhyperlipidemia, 10; migraine headaches, 20, and so on.\n  There are a lot of drugs that are being worked on. That is a new \ntreatment. That is a tool that has to be put in the hands of doctors.\n  Now, we have heard some comments, as well as different versions, \nabout surprise that AARP has backed this bill. It is not a perfect \nbill. We never pass a perfect bill out of the Senate.\n  AARP has had some comments on it. I hope my colleagues all pay \nattention to them. AARP believes that millions of older Americans and \ntheir families will be helped by this legislation. AARP also endorses \nthe Medicare bill. On November 17, they stated, ``The integrity of \nMedicare will be protected.''\n  These are the most significant reforms. It provides access to medical \nprescription drugs. It dramatically expands voluntary, private health \nplan choices. I hope my colleagues will look at the comments the leader \nmade and read them in full.\n  I thank the President for the time, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair now recognizes the Senator from New \nJersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today to join this historical \ndebate on health care for America's seniors. I also rise so that I can \nprovide a perspective to the people of New Jersey on why I will \nregrettably be voting against this Medicare conference report.\n  I particularly find it unfortunate and disappointing because there \nare 300,000 seniors in New Jersey, out of about 1.2 million, who lack \nany prescription drug coverage. Those seniors make tough choices \nbetween medicine and other of life's expenses, as we have heard talked \nabout in political debate for years.\n  I truly want to be a positive participant in assuring access to \nquality drug coverage at an affordable price for all of America's \nseniors. I think all of us do. That is why I voted affirmatively on a \nbipartisan Senate bill. I worked very closely with the senior Senator \nfrom Iowa to put together what I thought was an outstanding bill, one I \nwould have been proud to support.\n  Those 300,000 seniors badly need and deserve affordable, quality \ncoverage. But just as badly as they need it, we need to make sure their \ngain does not come at the expense of harming others. If the left-out \nseniors were the only ones impacted by this bill, I would vote for this \nplan we now are debating. I would vote for it because I thought it was \ngoing to provide access to those 300,000 folks and that would happen \nregardless of all the ideological or political arguments that have been \nmade over the last several days.\n  Sadly, hundreds of thousands of other seniors in my State will be \nseriously and negatively impacted by this bill. The fact is, this plan \nharms more New Jersey seniors than it helps. I calculate that, at a \nminimum, 500,000 seniors will be harmed, breaking the first rule of \nmedicine: ``Do no harm.''\n\n  The negative impact comes at a very high financial cost not only to \nmy State but to the Nation at large. I believe the scarce resources we \nare using would be better used to make the limited and complex benefit \nmore substantial and to reduce the harm to those who already have \nbenefits that they will lose.\n  This Senator can only wonder in that context that we feel compelled \nto lavish $14 billion of subsidies on HMOs and other insurers to \nprovide them profit incentives to compete with traditional Medicare as \nopposed to improving the benefits to uninsured seniors who are \nconstructively a part of this bill. We could close that so-called donut \nhole, that gap.\n  With all due respect to the Herculean efforts of those on both sides \nof the aisle who cobbled together this compromise--and I really do want \nto congratulate and thank those who worked so hard. Ranking Member \nBaucus, and Senator Breaux, the senior Senator from Louisiana, as well \nthe senior Senator from Iowa, have done a great job of trying to get to \na conclusion on which we could all agree. In my case, the cost/benefit \nfor New Jersey seniors just does not work. It just flat out does not \nwork.\n  My staff and I have done the numbers. We have worked very hard, to \nthe\n\n[[Page S15640]]\n\nbest of our ability, to really scrub down these numbers and to come up \nwith a conclusion on whether this works for our folks. Considering we \nare in a mad dash to absorb and analyze this 1,100-page bill, I will \nbet there is not a single Senator who has read it. I could be wrong. \nMaybe there are one or two who just did not have anything to do in the \nlast 24, 36, 48 hours, but I doubt if there is anyone who has read \nthis. The result is that the only certainty about this bill is that in \naddition to its unintended consequences, even from the well-intended, \nit is certain to have unfortunate consequences for many American \nseniors, as well as all of us who might hope to be seniors one of these \ndays.\n  So my reason for opposing this legislation is that this body should \nbe thoughtful and careful when we are spending $400 billion for a good \ncause, but we ought to make sure we are not doing more harm than good. \nThat is objection 1. Objection 2 is if we do not plan to implement this \nbill in its broad form before 2006, I do not understand why we need to \ncram all of this analysis into 48 hours or 72 hours over a 3- or 4-day \nperiod.\n  Why before Thanksgiving? What is the hurry when we have a bill this \ncomplex, this big, and we only have 3 or 4 days to look at it? I think \nthere are a lot of problems stuck right in here.\n  So let me repeat what I do know. For roughly $4,000 of out-of-pocket \npayments, a senior will get $5,000 worth of return, plus a catastrophic \ncoverage for everything above $5,000 of drug spending.\n  Let me repeat: A $4,000 payment for $5,000 worth of coverage will \ncome with a complex concoction of HMOs, PPOs, PDPs, premiums, \ndeductibles, copays, formularies, annual price increases, shifts of \nproviders, and a bevy of choices that are more to the confusion of \nseniors than they are to the security of seniors. In fact, the \ncomplexity of navigating this proposal for an individual senior is \nalmost enough of a reason for me to vote no on the bill to start with.\n  I have stood in all kinds of townhall meetings with seniors just \ntrying to explain the simple first steps of this bill. I think we are \ngoing to be creating a tremendous industry of opportunity out there \ninforming seniors about what is going to be borne from this 1,100 \npages, 1,200 pages of work. Somebody is going to have to tell folks how \nthey get through this.\n  That said, this bill does provide favorable relief to doctors, as I \nhave heard some talk about, serving Medicare patients. It gives some \nneeded aid to hospitals, particularly America's rural hospitals, as the \nSenator from Wyoming adequately presented. Of course, in a thousand \npages plus, there have to be some good things, and there are. We are \nspending $400 billion.\n  A few of the benefits I have talked about are good but, in my view, \nthey come at too high a price, and that is before one weighs in on the \nserious push in this bill to get Medicare on a pathway to privatization \nand the dismantling of the social safety net and coverage of our \nseniors' health which has been so fundamental to the success of moving \nso many of our seniors out of poverty into longer, healthier lives.\n  While this bill fundamentally being debated is in the context of \nprescription drugs in general, spending $400 billion, one would think \nthat might have some positive implications for the broader health care \nsystem. To that end, I believe this bill falls far short of the \nmark. Once again, at least from my perspective, it does more harm than \ngood.\n\n  Cost containment through Medicare negotiating the cost of drugs with \nthe drug industry could have led to lower prices for everybody in \nAmerica. You have unbelievably strong buying power out of Medicare--if \nthey were negotiating those prices. We are talking about reimportation? \nWe could do a heck of a lot better if we just had Medicare go out and \nnegotiate those prices. That would help all Americans: Children, \ngeneration Xers, juniors, seniors, corporate America. That is not \nhappening.\n  Other missed opportunities? Cost containment is omitted in this bill. \nThe only containment of costs that I see falls on the shoulders of \nbeneficiaries with escalating copays and premium hikes.\n  Equally troubling, reforming reimbursement rates for cancer treatment \nby doctors would have strengthened Medicare, as opposed to limiting \noncological drug payments that undermines cancer care. For my State, \nthis is really a troubling and unacceptable aspect. The fact is, we \nhave the third highest incidence of cancer in our State. I think we are \nputting at risk the treatment of that not only for our seniors but for \nthe whole of the community.\n  Egregiously--and this is where I strongly disagree with those who \nwould make this case--the diversion of $6 billion into these health \nsavings accounts in this bill I think is a big mistake. It encourages \nthe healthy and the wealthy out of the employer-based health care \nsystem, leaving the older and sicker and more poor in the system that \nremains or until employers drop coverage altogether. Frankly, I think \nthis appears to be a handout to insurers. Several credible studies, \nincluding the Rand Corporation's, suggest a major reduction in employer \nhealth care coverage will follow as the likely outcome of this tax cut \nproposal because of adverse selection.\n  I don't understand this. This doesn't seem to be relevant to the \npurpose we are about in a $400 billion prescription drug benefit for \nseniors. Once again, I think this legislation in this area does more \nharm than good. It certainly does with respect to the U.S. Treasury \nbecause I think it has the capacity to go well beyond the $6 billion in \ncost over a period of time, particularly as it is more of a savings \nprogram than it is one that is going to help on health care.\n  That is the big picture for me. As you can tell, I don't think it is \nso good. But let me now illustrate the specifics, as least as I see \nthem, in a cost-benefit analysis for New Jersey's seniors because that \nis what I care about. It is clear to me this is the analysis that is \nthe most important from my perspective. It is the primary driver for \nhow I came to my conclusion with respect to this bill.\n  This is not about insurers and HMOs. It is not about what the \nDemocratic caucus would argue. It is not about what political \nscorekeepers think. It is not even about the pharmaceutical industry, \nwhich, by the way, in our country is most heavily concentrated in my \nState. It generates about 65,000 jobs and produces about $30 billion \nworth of business and revenues. It is really important to our State. \nBut simply my analysis is about New Jersey's seniors and their role and \nparticipation in this program across this Nation. On that basis, I \nwould like to talk about some of what we see.\n  First of all, I think from all of the independent analyses we see, \napproximately 94,000 New Jersey retirees will lose their employer-based \nprescription drug benefits. There are estimates of 2.1 to 2.7, whether \nit is CBO or some private estimates. The middle of the range number for \nNew Jersey is about 94,000.\n  We have, in New Jersey, a substantial number of seniors, what people \ncall dual eligible, who would receive this wraparound of their Medicaid \nbenefits, various low-income folks, 152,000 of those who receive their \nbenefits through Medicaid and, as we all know, will be paying copays \nand potentially have an accelerated rise in health costs. They \ncertainly will be on formularies that may limit their choices of drugs. \nThose 152,000 seniors I think will find this difficult.\n  We also have 220,000 seniors who are currently enrolled in our State \npharmaceutical plan. I first want to congratulate the conferees because \nthey did provide for a wrap here around State programs. It is going to \nbe cumbersome and anything but seamless to move from the program that \nhas been in place for 25 years, created by a bipartisan set of \nGovernors and legislators over that period of time, that have provided \nthe State program. We are going to have to change it. We are going to \nhave to have our seniors go into private programs, and then the State \nis going to have to fill in those gaps, to be able to make sure that \nour low-income seniors, who have terrific programs, probably the best \nin the country, are able to maintain the same coverage.\n  As I say, I think the facilitating language with regard to financial \nobligations has been very good. I am very\n\n[[Page S15641]]\n\ngrateful for the work of the conferees with regard to this estimate. \nBut the seamless element, the quality of coverage with regard to this \nelement, this particular program, is going to be very hard to \nimplement. Each of these seniors, the lowest income seniors in our \nState, is going to end up being faced with formularies and be \nexperiencing changes each year with regard to who has maximum coverage, \nand it will be a major impact on how they look at it. Plus they are \ngoing to end up potentially paying copays and premiums that are \nslightly more than what they have in current benefits. So there is \nanother 220,000.\n  Finally, there are about 52,000 seniors in New Jersey's program who \npay more for Part 3 premiums due to the premium test--the means \ntesting--that is coming out. Some can argue means testing is good. That \nis said where you have already very high income seniors.\n  Now $80,000 in New Jersey, which is where this means testing begins, \nis not exactly superrich. We happen to have the most wealthy average \npopulation in the country. We also have the most expensive cost of \nliving of any place in the country. We pay more in taxes; we send more \nto Washington than anyplace else in the country. This means testing, \nwhich is going to affect about 52,000 of our seniors, is not going to \nBill Gates-like folks or Warren Buffett; it is going to middle class \nNew Jerseyans and I think is going to have a lot more bite. I would \nhave liked to have seen it set higher. It was cut back. I frankly \nwonder if this is going to be good for the overall Medicare Program \nbecause we are ultimately going to start pulling out a lot of these \nhigh-income seniors. As people know, Part B is voluntary, and we could \nend up again providing another adverse selection element to the overall \nunderlying traditional Medicare Program.\n  We will come back to some other perspectives with regard to New \nJersey. But by my calculations, it is 94,000 retirees with employer-\nbased coverage. They are going to lose that coverage, at least that \nquality coverage relative to what they will get in a new prescription \ndrug program in Medicare. There are 152,000 dual eligibles who will end \nup with payments that are different than what they would have had under \nthe old program; 220,000 of our State beneficiaries will end up with a \nlower quality, less seamless program than what they have today, and \n40,000--I talked about this earlier in my remarks--40,000 diagnosed \nwith cancer every year are going to have a much harder time getting \ndrug treatments that they previously had. It is going to cost about $50 \nmillion to the State over the 10-year period in payments with respect \nto these drugs. Those folks are going to be impacted.\n  Then there are the 52,000 subject to means testing. That is 558,000. \nI am not going to be so certain there are not some overlaps here, but \nwe are talking in the neighborhood of about 500,000 folks who are going \nto be hurt. There are now only 300,000 New Jerseyans who are without \ndrug coverage. I think that speaks for itself. There is a tough tally \nwhen you look at those who are harmed and those who are benefited. \nThat, to me, is an important consideration.\n  That is an important consideration. Those are not the only \nconsiderations. With regard to New Jersey, we have certainly one that \nalready meets the Medicare privatization approach that falls under the \npremium support program demonstration projects. Actually, it looks as \nif there will probably be two. I don't think our seniors are going to \nsay they want that in their backyard. They like prescription drugs, but \nthey also like traditional Medicare.\n  I think it is hard for me to go back to them and argue when they have \nhad a chance--by the way, we have seen a lot of people dropping out of \nMedicare+Plus Choice because they haven't felt like the program is \ngood. Plus a number of insurers dropped people who signed up for it. \nThey thought it was going to be a good deal and it didn't turn out to \nbe so. That is another one that a lot of folks talked about. There are \napproximately 1 million New Jersey Medicare beneficiaries who are going \nto see their Part B deductible rise at a faster rate than their Social \nSecurity benefit.\n  Some people will say that is not a part of this bill, that it is \nsomething else. But the fact is, we are building an escalator on Part \nB. It doesn't compare with what I think is going on with Social \nSecurity. At least when I go to townhall meetings, that is a real \nproblem for me to try to deal with and explain to folks. That is the \nchallenge.\n  Roughly 100,000 seniors will be negatively impacted and a lot of \nothers will feel as if they were somehow not properly protected in it. \nAgain, 300,000 don't now have drug coverage.\n  That system doesn't work. It is arithmetic. It is very \nstraightforward. It seems to me that there is more harm than benefits. \nFor me, the case is closed.\n  It would be remiss of me not to say that I have another objection \nthat I believe is built into this package. If I could convince myself \nthat New Jersey seniors were going to be benefitted, I would come \naround on this issue. But I think this package puts America on a \npathway to privatization of Medicare. I suggest that is not the right \ndirection. I think we ought to be enhancing and extending the \ntraditional Medicare Program and have a prescription drug benefit. We \nought to be using that $12 billion to $14 billion that is going to \nbenefit the managed care industry and the insurance industry to cover \nup one of those donut holes that we are talking about. We ought to be \nputting that money to work to enhance traditional Medicare.\n  While others have spoken eloquently and extensively, maybe even \npolitically about this, I think it is a very serious consideration for \nthose of us who believe that traditional Medicare should be enhanced.\n  I looked at three steps that will put it on that pathway.\n  Fourteen-billion dollars in subsidies and protection against \nskyrocketing health care costs provided to health insurers in this bill \ndoesn't seem to me to be the right place to put us into a comparative \ncost-benefit analysis with the private providers who I think have many \nincentives to cherry-pick the healthiest, the wealthiest, and the most \nable versus what is going to be left in the traditional Medicare \nprogram, which raises costs. I think that is step 1.\n  Step No. 2, this series of demonstration projects which is hardly a \nlevel playing field by comparison--and I think it is actually going to \nbe difficult for us to make a real assessment if it--I have heard \nactually limits this program under 600,000 folks. I think it is also \npossible that it will be cherry-picked in the areas as opposed to the \ndifficulty of looking at the wide diversity of populations that we have \nin the country. I am particularly troubled when I look at what I see \nwith regard to what fits into New Jersey with regard to this program. \nIt could be very difficult.\n\n  Then the third step is this 45-percent trigger on general fund \nexpenditures that will cause an overall review of traditional Medicare \nwhen the breach occurs. I think all of us realize with the changing \ndemographics and the baby boomers going into retirement, and with 40 \nmillion seniors growing to 75 million or 77 million seniors over the \nnext 10 to 15 years, we are going to have that happen. I think that is \ngoing to lead to pretty hard choices without the kind of triggers we \nhave here.\n  I think that it is just one more step, one more nail in the box that \nis trying to change us and move us away from traditional Government-\nsupported and underwritten Medicare to privatization. In my view, after \nan inadequate analysis of this 1,100-page bill, I really think that may \nbe the most troubling piece.\n  I think it is very difficult to be certain about any of the \nconclusions that any of us are drawing with regard to this bill. The \none thing that I do know for certain as it shows up both in the \nmarketplace and in the phone calls that we are receiving is that there \nare great benefits for the insurance industry and the pharmaceutical \nindustry built into this.\n  By the way, as I said, the pharmaceutical industry is right smack dab \nin the middle of my State. I like to see them do well. I like to see \nthem press forward in their research. But I don't think that should \ncome at the serious expense of many of America's seniors. I can say, at \nleast based on what I understand by my analysis, that is not the case \nwith regard to New Jersey seniors.\n  Frankly, I just do not understand this mad dash to get this done \nbefore\n\n[[Page S15642]]\n\nThanksgiving. It obviously must reflect some other agenda than what \nseems sensible. I think we ought to slow down. We ought to be careful. \nWe ought to be thoughtful. I know there are a lot of people who have \nspent a lot of time. We have heard about the 6 years of debate and \ndiscussion. But to come to a conclusion where we have to make a \ndecision about something that is extraordinarily important to the lives \nof the people across this country--not only to our seniors but to the \nfamilies, and the impact it has on the markets that we deal with with \nregard to prescription drugs--investing $400 billion is a very \nimportant issue. It ought to help our seniors as much as possible. It \nis a good thing. I think all of us want to be supportive. We should do \nour best with what we have to invest in this project. You have to think \nabout it in the context of a very limited amount relative to how much \nseniors are going to spend over the next decade. I hear estimates that \nit may be as much as $1.8 trillion. What we are talking about here is \nabout 20 percent of that.\n  We have to make tough choices. I appreciate the difficulty with which \nthe Senator from Iowa had to work his way through these difficult \nareas. I think he made a lot of good choices, but there are some in \nhere that are very difficult. I think we ought to be wise and reflect \non this 1,100-page report.\n  I am convinced we can do better, at least in the cost-benefit \nanalysis that I put together for my State.\n  As a consequence, I have to oppose this report. I hope we can slow it \ndown and make some revisions and bring it to a positive conclusion \nwhich is not ideological and which is not political; that is, believing \nwe are searching for the best interests of all of our seniors in \nAmerica.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, before the Senator from New Jersey \nleaves, I want to speak about a couple of words which he mentioned. And \nI don't say it to take exception with what he said or to quibble with \nhis description of the legislation before us. But if the President of \nthe United States saw Senator Grassley speaking right after some words \nthat the Senator from New Jersey used about legislation, the President \nwould be offended because I found fault with the President using those \nvery same words back on December 10 last year when I had my first \nmeeting with the President on the Medicare issue.\n  The words that the Senator from New Jersey used about the legislation \nbefore the Senate is that it is cobbled up. As everyone in this body \nknows, for about a year and a half I worked with five Members of this \nbody on what was then called the tripartisan plan. The President \nstarted his lecture to me last December, something along this line: We \nhave to have a dramatic change of Medicare. We have to provide \nprescription drugs for the seniors. We have to change Medicare for the \nfuture. He says: We do not want something like that cobbled-up \ntripartisan plan.\n  Obviously, the President cannot know everything that goes on in the \nCongress of the United States about forming legislation, but if he knew \nthe hours and hours, not only at the staff level but at the Member \nlevel, that went into the tripartisan plan that we unfolded here a year \nago in July, the President would not use the words ``cobbled up.'' I \nnever heard the President use the words ``cobble up'' after that \nbecause I tried to impress upon him there was a great deal of thought, \na great deal of hard work, and most importantly, time, plus bill \ncompromise that the word ``tripartisan'' implies to bring together \nwhere we were at that time.\n  If he had appreciated it, he would see we have to have the same sort \nof thought and hard work go into what he was thinking about. I never \nheard him say that again. I am reminded of that story now that the \nSenator from New Jersey said this legislation is cobbled together.\n  To some extent, I suppose every political compromise, for every piece \nof legislation, one could use those words to describe it. I know the \nSenator from New Jersey participates in a lot of very difficult \nlegislation in the committees he serves on and knows what it takes to \nput a bill together. However, I look at this piece of legislation, the \ncompromise it takes, the hard work it takes, all the long hours it \ntakes, as not a perfect piece of legislation but surely not a cobbled-\ntogether piece of legislation.\n  From that point of view I will respond not to the Senator from New \nJersey any further but to speak about some of the aspects of this \nlegislation as we get ready to vote on it tomorrow.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Will the Senator from Iowa yield for just a question and \na comment?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I would be glad to yield for a short question or short \ncomment and reserve my right to the floor.\n  Mr. CORZINE. I appreciate the comment with regard to cobbling. It is \ngreat to be put in the same company of criticism with regard to the use \nof the term. I do not want to leave the impression that I don't think \nthere was great thought and effort in putting together this \nextraordinary piece of legislation. It is actually a tremendous tribute \nto the Senator from Iowa for the ability to put together all the \nvarious interests in common and come up with something that is pretty \ndoggone close for all Members to be able to consider.\n  My concern is that it is very hard to know from this Senator's point \nof view all the details. I wish I could say I was absolutely certain \nthat I had analyzed this exactly the right way for those seniors in my \nState. But this is an incredibly complex issue, not only for the \nseniors themselves to be facing but also for those who are trying to \ndecide how we are investing $400 billion.\n  I congratulate the Senator for his efforts. Unfortunately, as I look \nat it, I come out with a different perspective, but I don't think it is \nfor lack of good intentions, hard work, and great compromise on the \nSenator's part.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I surely appreciate the good nature in which the \nSenator from New Jersey just stated his feelings about this \nlegislation. I wanted to give equal treatment to the President, as I \ndid the Senator from New Jersey and vice versa.\n  One of the aspects of this legislation that is misunderstood is the \nissue of health savings accounts, which is a new name for what people \nhear Congressmen talk about as medical savings accounts, only different \nin name, particularly, as it relates to people in my State, the benefit \nto farmers and small business people.\n  This bipartisan agreement includes these provisions establishing \nhealth savings accounts. I will refer to them as HSAs.\n  HSAs are tax-advantaged savings accounts that can be used to pay for \nmedical expenses incurred by individuals, their spouse, or dependents. \nHSAs are similar to medical savings accounts. However, medical savings \naccount eligibility has been restricted to employees of small \nbusinesses and the self-employed. HSAs are open to everyone with a high \ndeductible health insurance plan. The only limitation on the health \nplan is that the annual deductible must be at least $1,000 for \nindividual coverage, and $2,000 for family coverage. Contributions to \nthe HSA by an employer are not included in the individual's taxable \nincome. Contributions to an individual are tax deductible.\n  Total yearly contributions to an HSA can be as large as the \nindividual's health insurance plan deductible, between $1,000 and \n$5,000 for self-coverage, and $2,000 and $10,000 for family coverage.\n  The interest in investment earnings generated by this account is also \nnot taxable while in the health savings account. Amounts distributed \nare not taxable as long as they are used to pay for qualified medical \nexpenses such as prescriptions, over-the-counter drugs, and long-term \ncare services, as well as the purchase of continued health care \ncoverage for the unemployed individual. That is legislation we passed a \nlong time ago called COBRA.\n  Amounts distributed which are not used to pay for qualified medical \nexpenses will be taxable, plus an additional 10-percent tax being \napplied in order to prevent the use of HSAs for nonmedical purposes. \nThese accounts are portable, so an individual is not dependent on a \nparticular employer to enjoy the advantages of having an HSA, low-\nincome individual retirement account. The HSA is owned by the \nindividual, not by the employer, and if the\n\n[[Page S15643]]\n\nindividual changes jobs, the HSA goes with the individual.\n  In addition, individuals over age 55 may contribute extra \ncontributions to their accounts and still enjoy the same tax advantage.\n  In 2004, an additional $500 can be added to the HSA. By the year \n2009, an additional $1,000 can be added to the HSA.\n  In regard to this legislation before the Senate beyond the health \nsavings accounts, I point out what a great prescription drug benefit \nstructure we have. First and foremost, it is important to point out \nthat this is a voluntary program. If you currently have drug coverage \nand you like it, you can keep it or, if you do not have drug coverage \nand do not want it, you do not have to take it. If you are covered by \nMedicare fee for service today, and you are satisfied with it, you can \nstay right where you are.\n  This drug benefit also offered through Medicare will be a \ncomprehensive benefit that will provide real relief for our seniors. \nSeniors that now pay full retail price could see a 25-percent reduction \nin their prescription spending. Additionally, these seniors' overall \nout-of-pocket drug spending could fall by as much as 77 percent. This \nis real relief for real people, not some hypothetical.\n  To provide relief to all seniors, the drug benefit is based upon \nincome level. It is quite simple. Those who need more help because they \nare low income will receive more help under this program.\n  We divide this up according to the levels of poverty under the \nofficial poverty indexes of the Federal Government.\n  For those individuals and couples who are above 150 percent of the \nFederal poverty level, they can expect to see a monthly premium of $35, \nan annual deductible amounting to $250, a 75-25 percent cost-sharing up \nto a payment of $2,250, and a true out-of-pocket catastrophic cap at \n$3,600.\n  Additional benefits, including help with both the premium and initial \ncost-sharing, are targeted to seniors with income levels below 150 \npercent of the Federal poverty level. These subsidies will be available \nat increasing levels for those between 135 and 150 percent of the \npoverty index, and those between 100 and 135 percent. And then there is \nstill another category of greater help for those below 100 percent of \npoverty.\n  I will explain how this differs for each of these categories. First, \nfor individuals who are 135 to 150 percent of poverty, this group would \nhave a $50 deductible, sliding-scale premium assistance, and 15 percent \ncost-sharing up to the benefit limit of $2,250, and $2 or $5 cost-\nsharing above the catastrophic level--$2 meaning for generic, $5 for \nbrand-name drugs.\n  For individuals who are below 135 percent of the poverty index, they \nwould have no deductibles, no premiums, $2 and $5 cost-sharing up to \nthe catastrophic limit, and no cost-sharing after the catastrophic \nlevel has been reached.\n  Now, we go to the neediest of our seniors, the dual eligibles, those \nwho are presently low income and getting help not only from Medicare \nbut from the State Medicaid Program. They currently have their drug \ncosts paid for by the Medicare Program that differs a little bit from \nState to State based upon the laws of those States.\n  Our conference report calls for Medicare to pick up the cost of their \nprescription drugs. Most of this population will have a $1 and $3 cost-\nsharing up to the cost-sharing limit, and then, after that, no cost-\nsharing on the catastrophic. Now, that $1 and $3, again, is generic for \nthe $1, and $3 for the brand-name drugs.\n  By providing coverage to all seniors based on income levels, you can \nsee that the number of individuals with no prescription drug coverage \nwill fall from 24 percent in the year 2002 to 2 percent in the year \n2009.\n  Now let's make it clear. About over half of individuals today have \nsome prescription drug coverage--some very good, some not so good--and \nthen 25 percent, maybe 30 percent have nothing. Now, we expect this to \ngo down under this program to just 2 percent of our population, after 3 \nyears of phase in.\n  Mr. President, 98 percent of the seniors receiving prescription drug \ncoverage in 2009 will receive it from privately insured plans. \nMoreover, 33 percent of the beneficiaries will get their prescription \ndrug coverage from integrated private plans, three times the rate in \n2002.\n  Additionally, seniors will see immediate benefits with discount drug \ncards. These are going to be available in the middle of next year, and \nthrough all of the year 2005. Then, after the year 2005, the new \nprogram, in its entirety, kicks in. So the discount drug card is for an \ninterim period of time while it takes the Department of HHS a period of \ntime to set up what we are going to pass tomorrow. These discount drug \ncards will pass on between 15 and 25 percent of savings on seniors' \ncurrent drug prices.\n  It is clear to see that the conference agreement has come a long way \nsince we passed this bill in this body the first time in June. Many of \nmy colleagues wanted a lower deductible. We have a lower deductible. \nOther colleagues were more concerned with getting the dual eligibles' \ndrug costs out of the Medicaid Program and covering everybody by \nMedicare. We have done that as well.\n  So this is a good, solid drug benefit that will provide real relief \nto all seniors. Not only is this a good bill, with a good benefit, this \nbill provides an incentive for employers not to drop their retiree \ncoverage.\n  Because there has been so much misinformation about corporations \ndropping employees, and since we have gone to such great strides in the \nconference report to overcome that problem and reduce that possibility, \nI want to spend some time on that and make clear that what we did in \nthis respect--I think it is fair for me to say that the conference \nreport, the compromise between the House bill and the Senate bill, is \nvery much better than either the Senate bill, when it passed in June, \nor the House bill, when it passed the other body in June. So I would \nmake these comments about whether or not employers are going to drop \ncoverage of their retirees.\n  Now, we have heard a lot from opponents of this historic bipartisan \neffort alleging that this bill will cause employers to drop their \nretiree health coverage. But one thing these opponents do not do is \ntell the people the whole story.\n  So as Paul Harvey says, the rest of the story and the reality is that \nemployers have been dropping retiree coverage for years.\n  As you can see from this chart, there has been a gradual decline in \nthe number of corporations providing coverage for their retirees. Since \n1991, the number of larger employers offering health coverage to their \nretirees has dropped by nearly 20 percent, from 80 percent down to 61 \npercent.\n  This chart shows what we have been seeing in our States and hearing \nfrom our constituents. So employers have been dropping coverage for \ntheir retirees, and this has already been going on for more than a \ndecade.\n  We know these days employers are finding it harder and harder to \ncontinue voluntarily providing health insurance coverage for their \nretirees.\n  That is why we in the Medicare conference worked diligently--put \nresources behind it--to help employers continue providing coverage for \nretirees, not just to be nice to the retirees but to be nice to the \ntaxpayers because it is a heck of a lot cheaper to keep these retirees \nin their corporate plans than have them go on our plan.\n  That is our goal. Let me make it very clear; we have done a very good \njob of accomplishing that goal.\n  So let me tell you the three important ways we have done it.\n  First, the bill provides a 28-percent subsidy for the prescription \ndrug costs for retirees so they will continue providing this coverage. \nThat is about $750 per retiree, but that is just on average because \nevery corporation has a different plan.\n  Second, we exclude this retiree subsidy from the Federal corporate \ntax. This dramatically increases the value of this subsidy for retiree \ncoverage and helps the employer continue offering this coverage.\n  Third, the bill provides additional flexibility for employers to \nstructure plans that complement Medicare's new drug benefit.\n  Overall, the conferees agreed to put $89 billion in this bill to \nprotect retiree health coverage.\n\n[[Page S15644]]\n\n  This funding makes it more likely--obviously not less likely--that \nemployers will continue their retiree benefits. I think I ought to \nemphasize what $89 billion happens to be. That is 20 percent of all the \nmoney we are putting in this bill for prescription drugs for seniors. \nNow the Congressional Budget Office estimates that 17 percent of the \nretirees will not receive supplemental drug coverage from their \nemployers beyond what is offered by Medicare in this bill. We have a \ndifferent estimate from the Employee Benefits Research Institute that \nis outside of our government. It is a nationally respected organization \nthat studies retiree benefits. They estimate that that number is going \nto be much smaller: 2 to 9 percent of the retirees might not receive \nsupplemental coverage from their employer in the future if Congress \npasses the Medicare benefit.\n  According to the Employee Benefits Research Institute, if Congress \ncreates a Medicare drug benefit of any kind, some employers will want \ntheir retirees to take advantage of that new benefit. This is an \nimportant part of the rest of the story. The only way to prevent \nemployers from putting their retirees in the Medicare drug program is \nif we don't pass legislation such as this, if we say we don't give a \ndarn about the 25 to 30 percent of the people who don't now have \nprescription drugs and we don't care if they ever have it. That is not \nthe attitude of Congress. That is why this legislation is before us, \nbecause we do care about people who can't afford or don't have \navailable a plan for prescription drugs.\n  For those people, particularly on this side of the aisle, who have \nbeen complaining about not doing enough or that passing this bill might \ncause some corporations to change their health benefits and \nprescription drugs for their seniors, do they think we should do \nnothing? No, they don't think so. They are crying because we aren't \ndoing enough. I tell you honestly, we could put $400 billion, all of \nthis bill, into just those 30 percent of the people in this country who \nretire from corporations that have a pretty good prescription drug \nprogram, probably better than most people have, and I couldn't \nguarantee anybody in this country that some corporation, big or little, \nwouldn't dump their programs, just dump them, as they have been doing \nfor 20 years.\n  Let me be clear, these retirees will not be left without drug \ncoverage. Retirees are not going to lose drug coverage. Why? Because of \nthis bipartisan bill before us. These retirees will still be better off \nthan today, because today when their employer drops coverage, they are \nleft with nothing--no coverage whatsoever. Because of this bill, these \nretirees will be getting drug coverage from Medicare, and their former \nemployer will likely pay the monthly premium for them. They will still \nbe better off than they would be today where there is no Medicare drug \nbenefit to back them up.\n  It is also important to recognize that keeping employers in the game \nlowers the Federal cost of the drug benefit. That is why we are \nconcerned about the taxpayer as well as the corporate retiree. \nObviously, if it is dumped, it is going to cost the plan more than if \nthey stay on the corporate plan. So providing this 28 percent subsidy \nactually lowers the cost of the Medicare benefit. This generous 28 \npercent subsidy for retiree coverage is good policy. And because it is \ngood policy, it is good politics. This bipartisan bill protects retiree \nbenefits. That has been our goal, and we have accomplished it.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, Medicare contractor reform will not \nsucceed if contractors are subject to unlimited civil liability in \ncarrying out the payments, provider services, and beneficiary services \nfunctions expected of them. The conference agreement would therefore \ncontinue the past policy of limiting the liability of certifying and \ndisbursing officers, and the Medicare administrative contractors for \nwhom those officers serve, with respect to certain payments.\n  In addition, the language contained in section 911 of the conference \nagreement clarifies that Medicare administrative contractors are not \nliable for inadvertent billing errors but, as in the past, are liable \nfor all damages resulting from reckless disregard or intent to defraud \nthe United States. Importantly, the reckless disregard standard is the \nsame as the standard the standard under the False Claims Act. This \nstandard balances the practical need to shelter Medicare administrative \ncontractors from frivolous civil litigation by disgruntled providers or \nbeneficiaries with the Medicare program's interest in protecting itself \nfrom contractor fraud.\n  The False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 3729-3733, applies to \nMedicare fiscal intermediaries and carriers under current law. This \nlegislation makes it clear that the False Claims Act continues, as in \nthe past, to remain available as a remedy for fraud against Medicare by \ncertifying officers, disbursing officers, and Medicare administrative \ncontractors alike and that, among other things, the remedy subjects \nMedicare contractors to administrative, as well as trust fund, damages.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/23/senate-section/article/S15644-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15644]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR MONDAY, NOVEMBER 24, 2003\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, this week, leaders from thirty-\nfour countries around the Western Hemisphere gathered in Miami for the \nFree Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) Ministerial and Americas \nBusiness Forum for the purposes of expanding free trade within the \nWestern Hemisphere.\n  The negotiations at this and future Ministerial meetings will greatly \nimpact my State of Florida.\n  This event drew large headlines in the papers across the hemisphere \nas leaders converged upon Miami and anti-globalization protesters \ngathered outside to voice opposition. In this context, I feel it \nappropriate to commend Miami-Dade County, the City of Miami, and all \nthe local and Federal law enforcement officers who helped keep the \npeace during a tense week of negotiations, and everyone who made it a \nsuccess.\n  But in light of these talks, I want to share my own concerns \nregarding the FTAA negotiations, and the path ahead.\n  These talks did generate positive movement forward, towards greater \neconomic integration in the hemisphere. Trade Ministers agreed to a \nbaseline of minimum standards for a full and comprehensive agreement \nthat takes into account differing levels of development among nations. \nThis framework is a step forward that gives nations flexibility.\n\n[[Page S15645]]\n\n  A carefully negotiated Free Trade Area of the Americas could generate \nnew economic opportunities for Florida, our country, and the entire \nWestern Hemisphere.\n  Yet, the FTAA poses opportunities and challenges for Florida as we \nwork to make Miami the premier U.S. candidate city for the location of \nthe permanent FTAA Secretariat, while at the same time protecting the \nviability of a key part of our way of life in Florida--the domestic \ncitrus industry.\n  We must be cautious about the scope of the final FTAA and consider \nhow it affects our domestic industries. I urge U.S. negotiators to take \nsome important concerns into account as an agreement is shaped in the \nmonths ahead. The different parties, alliances, and groups involved in \nthe negotiations have gone back and forth on which goods and products \nto include in a final agreement, and the flexibility provided for in \nthe final Miami Declaration reflects this fact.\n  Citrus is one product that must not be included in these \nnegotiations. I again call upon the Administration, as I have done in \nthe past, to give citrus special consideration; given the unique nature \nof the citrus fruit and juice trade.\n  The administration should state unambiguously that it will not agree \nto any reduction of the current tariff on imported orange juice in the \ncontext of the FTAA or any other trade negotiation, until Brazil ceases \nits monopolistic, anticompetitive trade practices. Let me explain why \nthis is so important to the State of Florida.\n  This tariff is a lifeline for Florida's citrus industry and the \nState's economy because it helps to promote competition--and it enables \nus to compete in the global marketplace.\n  It is very clear that any reduction in the tariff would destroy \nFlorida's citrus industry and devastate the State's economy. The citrus \nindustry is the State's second largest, contributing over $9 billion to \nour economy. And the citrus industry accounts for nearly 90,000 direct \nand indirect jobs throughout Florida and the country.\n  A collapse of this industry would not only cost tens of thousands of \njobs, it would also cost the State and county governments of Florida up \nto $1 billion in lost tax revenues.\n  This would mean less money for other vital public services, such as \npolice and firefighters.\n  This spring, I arranged for Andrew LaVigne, Executive Vice President \nand CEO of Florida Citrus Mutual to testify before the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee and share these arguments, for the benefit of my \ncolleagues in the U.S. Senate so that they could be made a permanent \npart of the record, because they are so strong.\n  Orange juice consumption is concentrated chiefly in two places: the \nUnited States and the European Union. Unlike other agricultural \nproducts, production is also limited chiefly to two places: the United \nStates and Brazil. Florida's growers provide the vast majority of U.S. \ncitrus that is used for orange juice.\n  Florida's citrus industry is efficient, competitive, and \nenvironmentally responsible; it is also one of only a handful of U.S. \nagricultural commodities that receives no federal or state subsidies. \nLet me say it another way: American taxpayers do not subsidize the \ncitrus industry, unlike many other sectors that reaped benefits in last \nyear's farm bill.\n  Florida's citrus industry is composed of 12,000 growers, many of them \nsmall family-owned operations, in addition to the many tens of \nthousands of others around the state and country who contribute to this \n$9 billion industry. But, this is more than just an economic engine to \nFlorida. It is an American way of life.\n  Brazil's citrus industry, in contrast, is dominated by four large \nproducers who form large export cartels to maximize their advantage and \nsqueeze small producers. The industry also benefits from advantages \nbrought by years of past subsidization and dumping, lax environmental \nlaws, weak and largely un-enforced labor laws, and price manipulation. \nAnd, Brazilian orange juice already has access to U.S. markets. Their \ngovernment's pronouncements to the contrary are counterproductive to \nadvancing greater hemispheric economic cooperation.\n  Brazil's citrus industry also continues to rely heavily on child \nlabor and the low wages associated with using children.\n  In Florida, we do not allow children to work in our orange groves.\n  Until Brazil whole-heartedly enforces its labor laws, putting an end \nto child labor and paying workers a decent living wage, there will not \nbe a level playing field for competition.\n  Florida's citrus industry can compete with Brazil, or anyone else, as \nlong as there is a fair playing field. WTO negotiations should deal \nwith these problems. But in the meantime, the tariff on frozen \nconcentrated orange juice imports acts to balance the anti-competitive \npractices of Brazil. It also acts to prevent the large Brazilian \nproducers from overwhelming the U.S. market and driving Florida's \n12,000 growers out of business.\n  During the Trade Promotion Authority debate in 2001, Senator Graham \nand I offered an amendment that would have prevented tariffs from being \nreduced on commodities imported from other countries in violation of \ntrade laws, such as Brazilian orange juice.\n  Although this amendment was defeated, we were successful in including \nlanguage that required the Administration to study and report to the \nCongress on the economic effects that a tariff removal would have on \nimport-sensitive commodities like frozen concentrated orange juice and \ncitrus. I look forward to reviewing the results of these studies as the \ndebate progresses.\n  Without this tariff, the Florida citrus industry could collapse, and \nBrazil would have a monopoly over the global market. Already, Brazil \nproduces 53 percent of the world's orange juice and has a virtual \nmonopoly over the European market.\n  Removal of this tariff would not enhance free trade--it would, \nrather, giver Brazil a total world monopoly and make that country the \nworld's dominant citrus and citrus juice producer and enable them to \ncontrol market supply, access and prices with no competition.\n\n  This would not only devastate Florida's citrus industry, it would \nalso be bad for all consumers. Absent competition from Florida's \ngrowers, the large Brazilian cartels would have all consumers at their \nmercy.\n  I have worked to bring these issues to the attention of the \nAdministration and to ensure that one of Florida's primary industries \nis not traded away at the negotiating table, and I will continue to do \nso. In fact, I plan to travel to Brazil in the coming weeks and have \nasked to meet with President Lula da Silva so that I can carry the \nmessage of the Florida citrus growers: free trade can only benefit \nAmerican consumers if it offers free and fair competition and is not \nmonopolistic--so Brazil must reform its monopolistic citrus industry.\n  It is past time for this administration to acknowledge the \ninequalities between the U.S. and Brazilian citrus industries, and \nrecognizing these inequities, to treat citrus accordingly.\n  I would like to conclude by again urging the administration not to \nagree to any reduction of the current tariff on imported orange juice, \nbecause if they do, an American industry and American consumers will \npay a steep price. These issues are too important to the people of \nFlorida to be ignored, and we will all be watching closely in the \nmonths ahead.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record conclusions in \nthe testimony from Andrew LaVigne, Executive Vice President and CEO of \nFlorida Citrus Mutual, from a hearing before the House Agriculture \nCommittee on June 18, 2003, and Squire Smith, President of Florida \nCitrus Mutual, before the House Agriculture Committee, Subcommittee on \nLivestock and Horticulture on November 5, 2003, and an Op-Ed that \nappeared in the Miami Herald on November 19, 2003.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n       The U.S. market is by far the most significant market we \n     have. Unlike dairy and crop commodities, which are consumed \n     throughout the world, orange juice is consumed primarily in \n     the highly developed market economies of the United States \n     and Europe. With Brazilian juice firmly entrenched in Europe \n     at rock bottom prices, it only makes sense for Florida \n     producers to concentrate on sales at home. Our growth in \n     exports of specialty products, such as NFC, must necessarily \n     be incremental and secondary to the\n\n[[Page S15646]]\n\n     domestic market for FCOJ. While the Florida industry will \n     continue to seek out new export markets, both for fresh and \n     processed products, it is myopic to think that we are likely \n     to be as large a factor in foreign markets as Brazil. We \n     simply do not have the domestic subsidies we would need to \n     compete with the Brazilians and Europeans in Europe. \n     Furthermore, we cannot be there to develop those new foreign \n     markets slowly over the many years it will take them to \n     achieve higher disposable incomes, if the Florida industry is \n     forced out of existence by the elimination of the tariff. We \n     want to serve the U.S. market and we can do so without the \n     huge government payments that other agricultural sectors \n     receive. However, the U.S. orange juice tariff is necessary \n     to offset the unfair or artificial advantages that lower the \n     price of Brazilian juice.\n       Florida Citrus Mutual understands that free trade in many \n     industries, including many agricultural industries, leads to \n     increased competition, eventual price benefits to consumers, \n     and overall global economic growth. Unfortunately, free trade \n     cannot deliver these rewards to such a concentrated and \n     polarized global industry, especially one in which the \n     developing country's industry is, in fact, already the most \n     highly developed in the world. Florida Citrus Mutual \n     appreciated the opportunity to explain to the Committee the \n     unique global structure of the orange juice industry and the \n     negative economic effects that would occur as a result of \n     U.S. tariff reduction or elimination.\n                                  ____\n\n\n        Domestic Policies Affecting the Specialty Crop Industry\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       The U.S. Government's approach to domestic policy that \n     impacts the fruit and vegetable industry, including the \n     citrus industry, is to a large extent driven by the U.S. \n     trade policy as it affects the industry. Our ability to \n     properly address issues of pest and disease interdiction and \n     eradication, labor law reform, agricultural research and \n     export market growth depend almost entirely upon the \n     balancing impact of the tariff, which assures that the \n     industry can continue to exist in an unsubsidized domestic \n     environment alongside otherwise artificially manipulated \n     global competition.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From the Miami Herald, Nov. 19, 2003]\n\n                    Tariffs Would Control Oversupply\n\n                           (By Mark Ritchie)\n\n       Last September in Cancun, the Bush administration's \n     promises of free trade's benefits ran headlong into the \n     reality of the last ten years under the World Trade \n     Organization and the U.S.-Canada-Mexico arrangement known as \n     NAFTA--the North American Free Trade Agreement.\n       Governments from Latin America, Africa and Asia decried the \n     loss of millions of farm jobs, and denounced a system that \n     promotes the continued export of agricultural commodities \n     below their cost of production price (dumping) by U.S. and \n     European agribusiness corporations. That's why the WTO talks \n     in Cancun collapsed.\n       Fortunately, a close look at the underlying conflicts at \n     the WTO reveals the potential for a new approach that \n     negotiators trying to create a Free Trade Area of the \n     Americans should use as a blueprint. It would create a win-\n     win solution to the chronic low prices that plague farmers in \n     the United States, Brazil and elsewhere.\n       International trade negotiations used to be about finding \n     solutions that were aimed at benefiting societies as a whole. \n     In 1947, just a few miles from Miami, governments met in \n     Havana to discuss the creation of the International Trade \n     Organization (ITO). The stared goal for the organization was \n     full employment and the need to global monopolies and \n     predatory trade practices. At that time, the nations gathered \n     knew well the ravages of war and the role that brutal trade \n     conflicts played in creating the economic Depression of the \n     1930s, the breeding ground for fascism.\n\n\n                            Balancing needs\n\n       At the talks in Havana, the U.S. Department of Agriculture \n     brought forward a special set of agricultural trade rules \n     that would help balance the needs of producers and consumers \n     with an emphasis on protecting food security over the long \n     term. In essence, U.S. negotiators, with the Great Depression \n     still very much on their minds, developed rules that helped \n     nations balance supply and demand.\n       The ITO never got off the ground, but these agricultural \n     rules were included in the original general Agreement on \n     Tariffs and Trade, precursor to the WTO. The rules allowed \n     nations to use quantitative import controls as long as they \n     were imposing supply controls. This spurred countries to \n     address domestic oversupply, helping to bring global supply \n     and demand into balance. This plan was key to the ``golden \n     era'' for U.S. and global agriculture in the 1950s and 60s.\n       The WTO Agreement on Agriculture undid this important work, \n     but now the ministers gathering in Miami have an opportunity \n     to make improvements by returning to the work done by the \n     pioneers back in Havana in 1947. They have to tackle global \n     over-supply in ways that can help producers in Florida and \n     Brazil earn a profit by restoring the balance between supply \n     and demand that has been damaged by the ``race to the \n     bottom'' results of free trade.\n       Negotiators must address monopoly-style business practices \n     that dominate global trade in highly competitive products \n     when global prices fall too far.\n\n\n                           Tariffs beneficial\n\n       The solution to low commodity prices in general, be it \n     orange juice or coffee, is not that complicated. Every \n     business knows that when supply and demand are out of \n     balance, there is going to be trouble. In agriculture, when \n     there is not enough supply, some people go hungry. When there \n     is too much supply, prices drop, farmers suffer and many go \n     out of business.\n       We need modern trade agreements that enable countries to \n     restore the balancing mechanisms for supply and demand. To \n     take that step, the Bush administration needs to unlock the \n     ``free trade'' straitjacket of eliminating tariffs at all \n     costs, and start focusing on agricultural market \n     fundamentals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/23/senate-section/article/S15646-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15646]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        DANIEL AND JO ANN PLATT\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, today I rise to honor two outstanding \nMissourians, Daniel and Jo Ann Platt. The occasion is a special one, as \nthey celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary.\n  Only a year after Jo Ann, a native of Indiana, and Dan, a New Yorker, \nwere married on December 5, 1953, they came to the Midwest from \nManhattan, where Dan--an anesthesiologist--had been asked to become \nchief of the Anesthesia Department at Knickerbocker Hospital and the \nNew York Eye and Ear Infirmary.\n  Instead, Dan practiced at Alton Memorial Hospital, a place where the \nPlatts believed that he could engage in a personal, patient-centered \nstyle of medicine that was impossible in a larger, more urban hospital \nsetting. And there, he opened the first recovery room in the St. Louis \nmetropolitan area, and established one of the first coronary care units \nand intensive care units in the St. Louis area, along with Barnes \nHospital. Upon Dan's retirement in 2002, Alton Memorial Hospital \ndedicated its surgical and emergency building in his name, to \ncommemorate his 48 years of service to the community, complete with a \nbust and a plaque paying tribute to Dan as ``the consummate \nphysician.''\n  As Dan worked long hours at the hospital, Jo Ann was busy, as well. \nOver the years, she has served the community in many capacities, \nincluding as a member of the board of trustees of St. Louis Country Day \nSchool, on the vestry of The Church of Saint Michael and Saint George, \non the board of governors of the Saint Louis Woman's Club, on the board \nof the St. Louis Charitable Foundation, and as a board member for both \nthe Jennie D. Hayner Library Association and the Alton Museum of \nHistory.\n  Yet the bulk of Jo Ann's time was spent in supporting Dan's practice \nof medicine--which she considered a ministry--and being a devoted and \nfun-loving mother to their three children: Drew, now a commercial \nrealtor and developer in Evansville, IN; Brett, who runs his own \ncurrency hedge fund in London, England, and recently became engaged to \nMariela Ferro; and Carol, an attorney, political analyst and \ncommentator, who lives in San Marino, CA, with her husband Jack Liebau, \na portfolio manager who recently opened his own investment management \nfirm. Carol, after surviving Harvard Law School as an overt Republican, \nworked faithfully on my staff in Washington for 2 years before \nrealizing that her colleagues simply could not listen fast enough. All \nthree children remember lives filled with the love, support and \nencouragement of their parents--and many, many good times.\n  Truly, Dan and Jo Ann's life together has been full of \naccomplishments and blessings--most notably, the heartfelt love and \nrespect of their children and children-in-law. We wish them every \nhappiness in the years to come, together with our warmest \ncongratulations and best wishes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/23/senate-section/article/S15646-2", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15646-S15647]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second times by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n           By Mr. NICKLES (for himself, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Craig, \n             Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Inhofe, and Mr. Smith):\n       S. 1934.

A bill to establish an Office of Intercountry Adoptions \nwithin the Department of State, and to reform United States laws \ngoverning intercountry adoptions; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, today on National Adoption Day, I rise to \nintroduce the Intercountry Adoption Reform Act along with my colleagues \nSenators Landrieu, Craig, Bingaman, Inhofe and Smith. The primary focus \nof this bill is to streamline, simplify and improve the foreign \nadoption process for families, adoption agencies and more importantly \nfor the foreign adopted children of American citizens.\n  In the last decade, there has been a significant growth in \nintercountry adoption. In 1990, Americans adopted more than 7,000 \nchildren from abroad. In 2002, Americans adopted almost 20,000 children \nfrom abroad. Families are increasingly seeking to create or enlarge \ntheir families through intercountry adoptions. There are many children \nworldwide who are without permanent homes. It is the intent of this \nbill to make much-needed reforms to the intercountry adoption process \nused by U.S. citizens and therefore help more homeless children \nworldwide find a permanent home here in the United States.\n  There are two main goals of this legislation. First, and more \nimportantly, this bill acknowledges and affirms that foreign adopted \nchildren of American citizens are to be treated in all respects the \nsame as children born abroad to an American citizen. Under existing \nlaw, foreign adopted children are treated as immigrants to the United \nStates. They have to apply for, and be granted immigrant visas to enter \nthe United States. Once they enter the United States, citizenship is \nacquired automatically. Had these children been born abroad to American \ncitizens, they would have traveled back to the United States with a \nU.S. passport and entered as citizens. This bill provides for equal \ntreatment for foreign adopted children.\n  Furthermore, these children are not immigrating to the United States \nin the traditional sense of the word. They are not choosing to come to \nour country, but rather American citizens are choosing to bring them \nhere as part of their families. Once a full and final adoption has \noccurred, then the adopted child is a full-fledged member of the family \nand under adoption law is considered as if ``natural born.'' As a child \nof an American citizen, the foreign adopted child should be treated as \nsuch, not as an immigrant.\n  The second goal is to consolidate the existing functions of the \nFederal Government relating to foreign adoption into one centralized \noffice located within the Department of State. Currently, these \nfunctions are performed by offices within the Department of Homeland \nSecurity and the Department of State. Consolidation of these functions \ninto one office will result in focused attention on the needs of \nfamilies seeking to adopt overseas and on the children they are hoping \nto make part of their families.\n  Today, when a family seeks to adopt overseas, it has to first be \napproved to adopt by the Department of Homeland Security. Then, after a \nchild has been chosen, the Department of Homeland Security has to \ndetermine if the child is adoptable under Federal adoption law. After \nthis determination is made, the Department of State has to determine \nwhether the child qualifies for a visa as an immediate relative of an \nAmerican citizen. This bill seeks to minimize the paperwork involved \nand streamline the process by having these functions all performed in \none, centralized office, the Office of Intercountry Adoptions, staffed \nby expert personnel trained in adoption practices.\n  The focus of this office will be on foreign adoptions and only on \nforeign adoptions. Officials in the Department of Homeland Security and \nthe Department of State that currently perform the functions being \ntransferred to this new office have many other duties, such as \nscreening for terrorists or dealing with illegal immigrants. Adoption \nis frequently a low priority on the desk of such officers. By \nconsolidating these functions into one office, with its sole focus \nbeing foreign adoption, these issues can be handled more promptly and \ngiven the priority they deserve.\n  Another aspect of the Office of Intercountry Adoptions that I \nconsider extremely important is the proactive role that we intend for \nit to take in assisting other countries in establishing fraud-free, \ntransparent adoption practices and interceding on behalf of American \ncitizens when foreign adoption issues occur. By establishing an \nAmbassador at Large for Intercountry Adoption, this legislation will \nprovide a point of contact for foreign governments when issues \ninvolving foreign adoptions arise.\n  In the last few years there have been many examples of instances \nwhere our government has had to intercede on behalf of Americans \nseeking to adopt a foreign child. For example, Romania has been closed \nto foreign adoption for more than 2 years now. When Romania issued its \nmoratorium on foreign adoption, hundreds of American families who were \nin the process of adopting Romanian orphans were unable to complete \ntheir adoptions. Fortunately, the Department of State was able to work \nsuccessfully with the Romanian government to have these adoptions \nprocessed and persuaded Romania to grant exceptions to the moratorium \nfor these American families and their adopted. Unfortunately, the \nmoratorium is still in place leaving many orphans stuck in orphanages \nacross Romania.\n  There also have been major adoption issues involving Cambodia, \nVietnam, and Guatemala in the last 2 years. These issues are still \nbeing addressed by various officials within the Department of State and \nthe Department of Homeland Security. It will be greatly beneficial to \nhave a point person within the Federal Government to work on these \nissues, facilitate resolutions, and intercede on behalf of American \nfamilies.\n  There also are some very significant procedural changes in the \nforeign adoption process included in this bill. Under the Child \nCitizenship Act of 2000, a foreign child adopted by a U.S. citizen \nacquires automatic citizenship upon entry into the United States to \nreside permanently. This bill proposes to change the point of \nacquisition of citizenship from entry into the United States to the \ntime when a full and final adoption decree is entered by a foreign \ngovernment or a court in the United States. Prior to citizenship \nattaching, the child must be determined to be an ``adoption child'' \nunder U.S. law as defined in this bill. This provision is made \nretroactive to January 1, 1950, the year Americans began to adopt from \nabroad. This date also addresses the issue of children adopted during \nthis time period whose parents failed to naturalize them under previous \nlaw.\n  Additionally, the Secretary of State shall issue a U.S. passport and \na Consular Report of Birth for a child who satisfies the requirements \nof the Child Citizenship Act as amended by this Act. No visa will be \nrequired for such a child; instead it will be admitted to the United \nStates upon presentation of a valid U.S. passport. No affidavit of \nsupport under 213A of the Immigration and Nationality Act will be \nrequired nor will the child be required to undergo a medical exam. \nThese changes are again made to more closely equate the process of \nbringing a foreign adopted child home to the process of documenting and \nbringing home a biological child born abroad to a U.S. citizen.\n  When a U.S. citizen gives birth abroad, the parents simply go to the \nU.S. Embassy, present the child's birth certificate, their marriage \nlicense and proof of U.S. citizenship. Upon receiving this \ndocumentation, the embassy provides the parents with a U.S. passport \nfor the child and a Consular Report of Birth that serves as proof of \ntheir child's citizenship as well as the child's birth certificate. \nThis process takes little to no time to complete.\n  The process for foreign adopted children, however, is anything but \nquick and easy. Currently, an adoptive family may have to travel from \nthe country where it adopts a child to another\n\n[[Page S15648]]\n\ncountry in order to get the child's immigrant visa. Only certain \nembassies are able to grant such visas. On the other hand, most \nembassies are equipped to provide passports and Consular Reports of \nBirth. This will eliminate the need and expense associated with \nfamilies having to travel with their newly adopted children to another \nU.S. Embassy in a different location prior to bringing the children \nhome.\n  This bill also provides that the adoptive parents do not have to \nprove twice that they are financially capable of providing for their \nchild and eliminates the immigration requirement of having the child \nundergo a medical exam. Before a family is approved to adopt a foreign \nchild, the Federal Government has to be satisfied that the family is \nfinancially able to care for the child. This is part of the approval \nprocess. They should not have to repeat this process once they have \nfully and finally adopted a child.\n  In addition, prior to a family choosing to adopt a child, they should \nacquire and be provided as much medical information as is available on \nthe health of the child so that it can make an informed decision on its \nability to care for the child. Once that information has been provided \nand the child has been adopted, the child is now a member of the \nfamily. No biological child is denied entry because of medical reasons, \nnor should an adopted child be denied.\n  Another section of this bill provides for a new type of visa for \nchildren traveling to the United States for the purpose of being \nadopted by an American citizen who has been approved to adopt. \nCurrently children who are not adopted overseas prior to their entry \ninto the United States are allowed entry using an immigrant visa. As I \nhave stated earlier, these children are not immigrants. They are being \nbrought to the United States, at the request of a U.S. citizen, to \nbecome a member of that family. This new visa is a non-immigrant visa \nwhich authorizes admission of the child for the purposes of adoption. \nThe authorized admission under this section terminates on the date the \nadoption is finalized, or 2 years after the date of admission if the \nadoption has not been finalized. Until the child is adopted, the child \nwill receive temporary treatment as a legal permanent resident.\n\n  This bill also redefines the criteria used to determine a child's \neligibility for adoption This is a critical piece of this legislation. \nThe existing statutory language has not been revised since it was first \nwritten over 50 years ago. When it was written it was intended to deal \nprimarily with war orphans and it does not permit voluntary \nrelinquishment of children who have two living parents. The provision \nin this bill has been written to more fully comport with the language \nas agreed to in the Intercountry Adoption Act of 2000 which does permit \nthe adoption of children whose parents have irrevocably relinquished \nthem.\n  The bill also includes many safeguards such as: requirements that the \nSecretary of State is satisfied that the proper care will be furnished \nthe child; that the purpose of the adoption is to form a bona fide \nparent-child relationship; that the biological parent-child \nrelationships have been terminated; that the Secretary of State, in \nconsultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, is satisfied that \nthe child is not a security risk; and that whose adoption and \nemigration to the United States has been approved by the competent \nauthority of the country of the child's place of birth or residence.\n  Now that I have covered some of the significant aspects of this bill, \nlet me tell you what this bill does not do. It does not create more \nbureaucracy or additional regulation. It does not increase fees for \nadoption. It does not slow down the adoption process. It does not add \nmore red tape or additional paperwork. In fact, it does just the \nopposite.\n  It consolidates existing Federal processes for foreign adoptions into \nwhat is intended to be a ``one stop shop''--the Office of Intercountry \nAdoptions. It eliminates paperwork involved in getting an immigrant \nvisa and provides citizenship documentation up front for the child, \nsaving the adoptive family from having to deal with this upon its \nreturn home. Instead the fully and finally adopted child enters the \nUnited States on a U.S. passport as a U.S. citizen and child of a U.S. \ncitizen.\n  This bill is intended to ease the paperwork burden on adoptive \nparents who have already gone through extensive paperwork and \ndocumentation production to accomplish their adoption. It is intended \nto recognize that children adopted by American citizens are the \nchildren of American citizens and entitled to all the same rights, \nduties and responsibilities of biological children of U.S. citizens \nborn abroad.\n  I introduce this bill with the hope that its passage will \nsignificantly improve the foreign adoption process so that more \nchildren worldwide can find loving, permanent homes. It is my prayer \nthat someday, adoption will not be needed. That all children will be \nborn into stable, loving homes to parents who want them and are able to \ncare for them. However, until that day comes the foreign adoption \nprocess can be improved and should be improved. Foreign adopted \nchildren should be treated as children of U.S. citizens, not as \nimmigrants, and should be accorded all the same rights as biological \nchildren of U.S. citizens. To that end, I introduce this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1934\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS; PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) That a child, for the full and harmonious development \n     of his or her personality, should grow up in a family \n     environment, in an atmosphere of happiness, love, and \n     understanding.\n       (2) That intercountry adoption may offer the advantage of a \n     permanent family to a child for whom a suitable family cannot \n     be found in his or her country of origin.\n       (3) There has been a significant growth in intercountry \n     adoptions. In 1990, Americans adopted 7,093 children from \n     abroad. In 2001, they adopted 19,237 children from abroad.\n       (4) Americans increasingly seek to create or enlarge their \n     families through intercountry adoptions.\n       (5) There are many children worldwide that are without \n     permanent homes.\n       (6) In the interest of United States citizens and homeless \n     children, reforms are needed in the intercountry adoption \n     process used by United States citizens.\n       (7) In addition, Congress recognizes that foreign born \n     adopted children do not make the decision whether to \n     immigrate to the United States. They are being chosen by \n     Americans to become part of their immediate families.\n       (8) As such these children should not be classified as \n     immigrants in the traditional sense. Once fully and finally \n     adopted, they should be treated as children of United States \n     citizens.\n       (9) Since a child who is fully and finally adopted is \n     entitled to the same rights, duties, and responsibilities as \n     a biological child, the law should reflect such equality.\n       (10) Therefore, foreign born adopted children of United \n     States citizens should be accorded the same procedural \n     treatment as biological children born abroad to a United \n     States citizen.\n       (11) If a United States citizen can confer citizenship to a \n     biological child born abroad, then the same citizen is \n     entitled to confer such citizenship to their legally and \n     fully adopted foreign born children immediately upon final \n     adoption.\n       (12) If a United States citizen cannot confer citizenship \n     to a biological child born abroad, then such citizen cannot \n     confer citizenship to their legally and fully adopted foreign \n     born child, except through the naturalization process.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to ensure that foreign born children adopted by United \n     States citizens will be treated identically to a biological \n     child born abroad to the same citizen parent;\n       (2) to improve the intercountry adoption process to make it \n     more citizen friendly and child oriented; and\n       (3) to foster best practices.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Adoptable child.--The term ``adoptable child'' has the \n     same meaning given such term in section 101(c)(3) of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101(c)(3)), as \n     added by section 204(a) of this Act.\n       (2) Ambassador at large.--The term ``Ambassador at Large'' \n     means the Ambassador at Large for Intercountry Adoptions \n     appointed to head the Office pursuant to section 101(b).\n\n[[Page S15649]]\n\n       (3) Full and final adoption.--The term ``full and final \n     adoption'' means an adoption--\n       (A) that is completed according to the laws of the child's \n     country of origin or the State law of the parent's residence;\n       (B) under which a person is granted full and legal custody \n     of the adopted child;\n       (C) that has the force and effect of severing the child's \n     legal ties to the child's biological parents;\n       (D) under which the adoptive parents meet the requirements \n     of section 205; and\n       (E) under which the child has been adjudicated to be an \n     adoptable child in accordance with section 206.\n       (4) Office.--The term ``Office'' means the Office of \n     Intercountry Adoptions established under section 101(a).\n       (5) Readily approvable.--A petition or certification is \n     considered ``readily approvable'' if the documentary support \n     provided demonstrates that the petitioner satisfies the \n     eligibility requirements and no additional information or \n     investigation is necessary.\n\n           TITLE I--ADMINISTRATION OF INTERCOUNTRY ADOPTIONS\n\n                         Subtitle A--In General\n\n     SEC. 101.

Mr. President, two years ago, I had the distinct \npleasure of spending an hour with the President of China, Jiang Jiamin. \nAs you know, President Jiamin is tremendously busy and has numerous \nrequests for personal meetings, but he agreed to meet with this \nparticular U.S. delegation because of the importance of the subject we \nwere there to discuss, international adoption. During this meeting, he \nshared with us that the Chinese believe every child born is born with a \nred string attached to their heart, the other end of which is tied to \nthe ankle of their soul mate. It is because of this string, they \nbelieve, that soul mates eventually find each other and spend the rest \nof their lives together. It is his belief, that perhaps the same is \ntrue of children who are adopted. That when they are born, their hearts \nhave a string that is tied to the ankle of their forever family, and it \nis because of that heartstring that they eventually find one another.\n  I will treasure the memory of this meeting forever. Not only because \nit was an extreme honor to meet with such a learned and distinguished \nleader, but because it reminds me of how profound adoption is. 19,237 \nchildren were adopted by American citizens last year. 18,477 children \nthe year before that, 16,363 in 1999 and 15,744 children in 1998. That \nis almost 100,000 children in four years. I think it is easy for us to \nunderstand the impact that these adoptions have had on the adoptive \nfamilies and the orphan children, but what I would like to focus on \nthis morning is the impact that this has for\n\n[[Page S15652]]\n\nthe diplomatic relations between the United States and countries \nthroughout the world.\n  In sheer numbers alone, the impact is evident. In real terms, these \nchildren are ``mini-ambassadors'' to 200,000 American citizen parents, \n400,000 grandparents, conservatively 800,000 aunts and uncles, and \n300,000 siblings. According to a recent report by the U.S. Census \nBureau, 1.6 million people in the United States were adopted, fifteen \npercent of them from abroad. Because of this magnificent process, \ncommunities all over the U.S. are deepening this understanding and \naffinity for the people of the world. September 11 reminded us of the \nimportance of continuing to build bridges with the nations of the \nworld. International adoption is one very effective and lasting way to \nbuild these bridges.\n  Over this past year, I have also had the privilege of meeting with \nthe Presidents of Kazakstan, Romania and Russia and high-ranking \ngovernment officials from Cambodia, Vietnam, Guatemala, Africa, and the \nUkraine. Each time the message is the same. They want to do what they \ncan to make the Hague more than just a piece of paper with 59 \nsignatures on it. They are looking to the U.S. to lead the way toward a \nsystem of international adoption and child welfare that is based on \nbest practices. A system comprised of meaningful protections for the \nadoptive parents, the birth parents, and perhaps most importantly the \nchildren; a system that universally recognizes that a government \ninstitution is not and cannot be an adequate replacement for a family \nand works toward the shared mission of finding every child in this \nworld a loving and nurturing, permanent family.\n  I am proud to be here today, along with my colleague, the Senior \nSenator from Oklahoma, to introduce legislation that will take us in \nthat direction. What it proposes to do is simple, but what it might \nhelp us to achieve is limitless. Simply put, this bill hopes to \nstreamline the existing international adoption process, consolidate its \nfederal functions into one agency and to empower that agency with the \nstaff and resources it needs to represent the United States, the \nlargest beneficiary from international adoption. With this office in \nplace, the United States can begin to lead the world community in \nforging an international system of adoption that protects the interests \nof all those involved.\n  Under current law the federal responsibility for international \nadoption lies with the Department of State and the U.S. Citizenship and \nImmigration Services. This dual jurisdiction gives rise to several \nproblems including: lack of coordination, lack of accountability, \nduplication of efforts and unnecessary paperwork and fees for \nprospective adoptive families. It also impedes the State Departments \nability to fulfill its responsibilities as the central authority under \nthe Hague Treaty on Cooperation in International Adoption.\n  Now, you may be asking yourself, as I have many times, what does \nadoption have to do with immigration? You see, under current law \nchildren adopted by United States citizens abroad are treated as \nimmigrants, forced to apply for an immigrant visa to enter the United \nStates. This process is not only impractical, since these children \nobtain automatic citizenship upon entry into the United States, it is \ninequitable. Children born to U.S. citizens abroad are conferred \nautomatic citizenship upon their birth and are therefore permitted to \ntravel to the United States on a U.S. passport. Children adopted by \nUnited States citizens should be afforded this same protection. This \nbill affords them that protection.\n  This bill also proposes that we update the current law definitions of \nan ``adoptable child'' to reflect the types of children in need of \nhomes throughout the world. The current law definition of ``orphan'' \nreflects the reality for which it was created; to help U.S. citizens \nadopt children orphaned by the wars in Korea and Vietnam. As such, it \nis an extremely narrow definition that in many cases prohibits a family \nfrom bringing their newly adopted child to the United States.\n  In creating an Ambassador at Large for international adoption, this \nbill hopes to provide the leadership and high level diplomatic \nrepresentation so desperately needed in international adoption. Under \nhis or her leadership, the Office of International Adoptions will be \nable to take the proactive measures necessary to limit corruption and \nensure that adoptions are performed in the most efficient, transparent \nmanner possible. The Hague Treaty already gives the State Department \nthis responsibility; this bill is designed to help them fulfill it.\n  Let me tell you why we need to act now to pass this legislation. \nBecause of the lack of consistent leadership by the United States in \nthis area, many countries around the world are in ``crisis mode'' and \nhave been forced to take unilateral actions to solve perceived problems \nin the system. For two years, there has been a moratorium on \ninternational adoption in Romania. The second anniversary of the INS \nissued suspension in Cambodia is fast approaching. The governments of \nGuatemala and Vietnam have taken actions to limit the number of \ninternational adoptions. In each and every one of these cases, the \nforeign governments have expressed frustration with the lack of action \non the part of the U.S. to limit corruption or close potential \nloopholes in the system. The end result, hundreds and thousands of \nchildren are left in orphanages. This cannot be.\n  I have spent the past two years talking to foreign governments, \nagencies, and most importantly, adoptive parents and they tell me that \nthis legislation is needed. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting this legislation and I look forward to seeing it passed as \nsoon as possible.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise today, National Adoption Day, to \njoin my colleagues in introducing this bill to give children everyhwere \naround the world a greater chance to find a loving, permanent home.\n  This bill, the Intercountry Adoption Reform Act (ICARE), will \nautomatically make a child who is adopted from another country a \ncitizen the minute the adoption is finalized.\n  This legislation has a personal impact for me. My granddaughter was \nadopted from Ethiopia a few years ago. Even though she is a vital part \nof our family, she was not a citizen when she arrived. We now have to \ndo work to make the law recognize her in the same light we do--as a \nlegal member of our family and a lawful citizen of this country--\nentitled to the same rights and privileges as all my other biological \ngrandchildren.\n  ICARE will ensure that foreign-born children, such as my \ngranddaughter, will be treated the same as biological children born \nabroad to the same parent who is an American citizen. It will help \nstreamline international adoptions and implement best practices for all \nadoptions.\n  Situations such as one that happened in my State of Oklahoma would \nnot have happened under this legislation. Anna Lynn Fincher was born in \nthe Philippines and adopted by a U.S. military couple in the \nPhilippines. Even though they adopted Anna Lynn in the Philippines, \nthey never brought her to the United States. Sadly, both of Anna Lynn's \nAmerican parents died while in the Philippines--before Anna Lynn was \nable to set foot on American soil and become a U.S. citizen. As a \nresult, she had to be granted Humanitarian Parole, which is granted to \npeople in extreme circumstances, so that she could come to the United \nStates and be adopted by her adoptive sister.\n  Under ICARE, Anna Lynn would have become a citizen as soon as her \nadoption was finalized--eliminating the need for Humanitarian Parole \nand another adoption.\n  Providing children, such as my granddaughter and Anna Lynn, with a \npermanent, stable family is the most precious gift we can give a child. \nI am proud to lend my support to this important legislation that will \nhelp give these young people a home.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORZINE:\n  S. 1935. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to require \nemployers to offer health care coverage for all employees, to amend the \nSocial Security Act to guarantee comprehensive health care coverage for \nall children born after 2001, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation on \nan issue that is of utmost importance to me, to the State of New \nJersey, and to our Nation: providing universal access to health \ninsurance.\n\n[[Page S15653]]\n\n  This is an issue I talked about incessantly during my campaign, \nbecause I strongly believe it is a national outrage that we are the \nonly industrial society on earth that does not insure the health of all \nits people.\n  I begin with a basic premise. Health care is a basic right, and \nneither the government nor the private sector is doing enough to secure \nthat right for everyone.\n  Unfortunately, as I have traveled across the State of New Jersey, I \nhave talked to many men and women who lay awake nights trying to figure \nout how to care for loved ones. I've met people who work two jobs to \nsupport their family, and end up taking their kids to the emergency \nroom when they're sick because they are unable to afford preventive \ncare and timely treatment for their children.\n  In 2002, more than 43 million Americans--or a staggering 17 percent \nof the total nonelderly population--were uninsured. In my State of New \nJersey, 1.1 million citizens lack health insurance.\n  The number of uninsured grew steadily throughout the 1990's until \n1999, when modest increases in employer coverage due to the robust \neconomy, coupled with expansion and improved enrollment in the State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), led to the first decline in \nthe number of uninsured in over a decade. Unfortunately, the number of \nuninsured is on the rise again, as State budget deficits have forced \ndeep cuts in public health programs and as unemployment has risen.\n  Unemployment, however, is not the leading cause of being uninsured. \nIn fact, more than eighty percent of the uninsured--four out of five \nAmericans--are in working families. Seventy-two percent live in \nhouseholds with a full-time worker, and 11 percent live with a part-\ntime worker. Low-wage workers are at greater risk of being uninsured, \nas are unskilled laborers, service workers, and those employed in small \nbusinesses.\n  The consequences of our Nation's significant uninsured population are \ndevastating for our health and our economy.\n  The uninsured are significantly more likely to delay or forego needed \ncare and are less likely to receive preventive care.\n  Delaying or not receiving treatment can lead to more serious illness \nand avoidable health problems, which in turn results in unnecessary and \ncostly hospitalizations. For example, the uninsured are more likely \nthan those with insurance to be hospitalized for conditions that could \nhave been avoided, such as pneumonia and uncontrolled diabetes. In \naddition, the uninsured with various forms of cancer are more likely to \nbe diagnosed with late stage cancer.\n  Indeed, my own State of New Jersey struggles to deal with the costs \nof charity care provided to the uninsured. In 2002, New Jersey \nhospitals provided $624 million in charity care to the uninsured and \nunderinsured, but were only reimbursed for $381 million of these costs.\n  In sum, health insurance coverage matters. It matters to families who \ndon't receive adequate care, and it matters to communities. We ignore \nthe issue of the uninsured at our peril and at a great cost to the \nquality of life--and to the very life--of our citizens. That is why \ntoday I am introducing legislation that will provide universal access \nto health care for all Americans. My legislation, the Universal Secure \nAccess to (USA) Health Care Act has several components:\n  First, we must cover all children. Despite the success of the CHIP \nprogram, over nine million children are still uninsured. These children \nare less likely to have immunizations and receive less preventive care, \nwhich often results in health problems later in life and also leads to \npoor school performance. The millions of uninsured children cannot \ncontrol whether they have health care coverage, and it is a measure of \nthe failure of our politics that we do not take care of our children.\n  My proposal, modeled on legislation introduced by Senator \nRockefeller, would create a MediKids program that would provide \nuniversal health insurance for children up to age 23 through a new \nfederal program modeled after Medicare, but with benefits tailored \ntoward the needs of children.\n  Maintaining the health of our children is critical to the future of \nour country. Indeed, it is clear that providing health care coverage to \nchildren impacts more than just their health--it impacts their ability \nto learn, their ability to thrive, and their ability to become \nproductive members of society. MediKids simplifies the confusing array \nof health insurance assistance programs for children today and \nguarantees them coverage until adulthood.\n  The next step is to demand that the private sector do its part. Under \nmy bill, large employers would be required to provide health coverage \nfor all their workers. A minimum wage in America should include with it \nminimum benefits, among them health insurance. But unfortunately, the \ncurrent system puts the responsible employer who provides health \ninsurance at a disadvantage relative to the employers who do not. When \nemployers fail to cover employees, society pays their share of the bill \nat the emergency room. In fact, the universal health care delivered in \nthe emergency rooms of our community hospitals is the most expensive \nand short-sighted approach to address the problem of the uninsured \nAmericans.\n\n  Under my bill, small businesses, the self-employed and unemployed \nwould be able to buy coverage in the Federal Employee Health Benefit \nProgram. If it is good enough for Senators, it is good enough for \nAmerica. Those who are between the ages of 55 and 64 would be able to \nbuy-in to the Medicare program. My legislation would provide tax \ncredits to the self-employed to assist them in purchasing health \ninsurance and would allow them to buy into the FEHBP program. But \nalthough I am passionate about universal access to health care, I \nrealize we can't get there yet. Not because the popular will is not \nthere, but because the political will isn't.\n  Therefore I believe we can and should be doing all that we can to \nmake incremental progress. So I support incremental changes, starting \nwith the most vulnerable populations, and building on Medicaid and \nCHIP, success public programs. That is why I am a strong supporter of \nthe Family Care proposal, which would cover the parents of children \nalready enrolled in the CHIP program.\n  I was also pleased to be an original cosponsor of Senator Bingaman's \nbipartisan legislation, the Start Healthy, Stay Healthy Act, which \nwould expand coverage for children and pregnant women. It is based on \nthe common sense principle that children deserve to start life healthy \nand stay healthy.\n  Health professionals agree that one of the best ways to ensure the \nbirth of a healthy baby is to ensure adequate prenatal care. Yet as a \nNation, we do far too little to provide this type of care. This is \nevident by the stark statistics on the subject: the United States ranks \n27th in infant mortality and 21st in material mortality--the worst \namong developed nations. The statistics in New Jersey are equally \nstark: New Jersey ranks an abysmal 44th among the States in the \npercentage of mothers receiving adequate prenatal care, 34th in low \nbirth weights, and 12th in infant mortality rates.\n  Specifically, this important legislation would allow States to cover \nprenatal care services for women up to 185 percent of the Federal \npoverty level through the Children's Health Insurance (CHIP) Program. \nIt would also allow States to extend coverage to children under the \nCHIP program through age 20, and would increase CHIP funding by $2.65 \nbillion over four years.\n  I often say that we are not a Nation of equal outcomes, but we should \nbe a Nation of equal beginnings.\n  Until we give all Americans access to health care, however, we cannot \nlive up to that promise.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1935\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Universal \n     Secure Access to Health Care Act of 2003''.\n       (b) Findings.--\n       (1) In 2002, 43,600,000 Americans, nearly 17.2 percent of \n     the total nonelderly population, were uninsured.\n\n[[Page S15654]]\n\n       (2) The number of uninsured has grown by nearly 10,000,000 \n     over the past decade.\n       (3) While 61 percent of Americans receive health insurance \n     coverage through their employers, millions of Americans lack \n     access to such coverage either because their employer does \n     not offer such coverage or the employer cannot afford to pay \n     for such coverage.\n       (4) Today, fewer Americans have health insurance through \n     their employment to cover themselves and their dependents \n     than 10 years ago.\n       (5) Eighty-two percent of the individuals that are \n     uninsured in the United States are in working families.\n       (6) Low-wage workers have more difficulty obtaining \n     affordable health care coverage since such workers are less \n     likely than high-wage workers to have such coverage offered \n     as a benefit by an employer, and prohibitive premiums for \n     individually purchased coverage often prevents such workers \n     from purchasing such coverage independently.\n       (7) The consequences of our nation's significant uninsured \n     population are devastating.\n       (8) The uninsured are significantly more likely to delay or \n     forego needed health care.\n       (9) The uninsured are less likely to receive preventive \n     health care.\n       (10) Delaying or foregoing health care treatment when such \n     treatment is needed can produce unnecessarily dire and \n     expensive results. More severe health care conditions may \n     arise and more expensive health care treatments, such as \n     costly hospitalizations, may be necessary even though such \n     conditions or treatments could have been avoided by the \n     initial provision of adequate and timely health care. The \n     uninsured, for example, are more likely to be hospitalized \n     for conditions that could have been avoided, such as \n     pneumonia and uncontrolled diabetes, than the insured. The \n     uninsured with various forms of cancer are also more likely \n     to be diagnosed with late stage cancer than the insured.\n\n     SEC. 2. AMENDMENT TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT.\n\n       The Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 201 et seq.) is \n     amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n          ``TITLE XXVIII--UNIVERSAL HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE\n\n       ``Subtitle A--Employer Mandated Health Insurance Coverage\n\n     ``SEC. 2801.

Mr. President, we want to make sure there is time this \nevening for Senators Bingaman and Levin to give their remarks. If there \nis no further business to come before the Senate, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the Senate stand in adjournment under the previous order, \nfollowing the remarks of Senator Bingaman and Senator Levin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the committee. I \nappreciate the chance to speak briefly on this bill. It is a very \nimportant piece of legislation. I congratulate the Senator from Iowa on \nthe hard work he has put into this legislation. I do not share his \nconclusion about it at this stage, but I certainly admire the work he \nhas put in and admire the good job he does as chairman of the committee \non which I serve.\n  When the 2000 Presidential campaign was underway, I saw one of the \ndebates between then-Governor Bush and then-Vice President Gore. Both \nof them in that debate endorsed the enactment of a prescription drug \nbenefit for seniors for Medicare beneficiaries. I remember thinking \nwhen I saw that, this is one good thing that will come out of this \ncampaign in the next few years, no matter who wins. But what I had in \nmind as a prescription drug benefit was a very different animal than \nwhat we have in these 1,100 pages that have been referred to \nrepeatedly.\n  What I had in mind was a benefit where Medicare beneficiaries would \nbe able to sign up for a prescription drug benefit. It would be \nvoluntary. They could sign up or not. They could then pay a monthly \npremium. They would get a card. They could take that card, go to the \npharmacy and get their prescription drugs. They might have to pay a \ncopay. They might have to pay some deductible. But it was basically the \nadding of a prescription drug benefit to Medicare. That is what I \nthought both candidates were talking about.\n  That is not what we have in these 1,100 pages. Had we decided to \nenact that, it could have been done in a much smaller document.\n  I regretfully have to oppose the conference report for H.R. 1 as it \ncomes before us tonight and tomorrow.\n  I will cite six reasons I have come to that conclusion. The first \nreason is that the bill, in my view, over time, will undermine \ntraditional Medicare.\n  The second reason is that the bill requires the Government to overpay \nprivate health plans by tens of billions of dollars.\n  The third reason is that the bill actually will harm many senior \ncitizens who are intended to benefit.\n  Fourth, the bill will increase drug costs rather than reducing them.\n  Fifth, the bill will dramatically increase the complexity and \nvolatility of the Medicare system for many of our seniors.\n  Finally, the sixth point is that the bill will increase the financial \nburden on States and make it more difficult for each of our States to \nmaintain the benefits they provide through their Medicaid programs to \nlow-income patients.\n  Let me start with the problem that I see of this bill undermining \ntraditional Medicare. Today, 88 percent of all of those 41 million \npeople who are served by Medicare are enrolled in traditional Medicare. \nThe major thrust of this bill is not to add a prescription drug benefit \nbut instead to do what is euphemistically referred to as ``modernize'' \nMedicare.\n  Now, there are definitely some things we should do to modernize \nMedicare. I would agree with that. But as that term is used in this \ndiscussion, most of the time it is a code word, meaning that we should \nmove people--seniors and disabled individuals--out of traditional \nMedicare into the private health care system. That is what is meant by \na lot of our colleagues when they talk about modernizing Medicare.\n  There are two good reasons for moving people out of traditional \nMedicare into the private health care system, as I see it. I could \ncertainly favor doing that if we could accomplish these purposes. The \nfirst, obviously, would be to make the program more efficient and save \nmoney--save some taxpayer dollars by moving these people out of the \nGovernment plan into a private plan.\n  The second, of course, would be if we could improve services, \nincrease the satisfaction of Medicare beneficiaries by moving them into \nthe private plan.\n  Let me just show this chart. Medicare cost growth: This relates to \nthe first of those two points. Medicare has historically controlled \ncosts far better than either private health care plans have, or even \nbetter than the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, FEHBP. We \nall take great pride in the FEHBP program and talk about how this is a \ngreat benefit and we should extend it to others.\n  Between 1969 and now, Medicare's costs have increased at an annual \nrate of 8.9 percent a year, which stands in contrast to the 11 percent \ngrowth rate in the private health insurance arena and 10.6 percent \ngrowth rate in FEHBP. So the ideology of this drive to modernize \nMedicare or move people out of traditional Medicare into the private \nsystem does not match the evidence. In fact, the recent record is even \nmore dramatic. Between 1996 and 2003, Medicare's per capita growth was \n4.2 percent compared to 5.9 percent for private health plans and 5.3 \npercent for FEHBP.\n  Medicare wins the contest going away. But maybe some are willing to \npay higher costs, so this chart should make that point. The red line \nshows the increase in costs from 1970 to the end of the century in \nprivate insurance. The blue line shows the increase in the cost of \nMedicare. They have both gone up, but Medicare has gone up less \nrapidly. We might still be willing to pay more--pay the amount required \nto put people on this red line if, in fact, we had greater patient \nsatisfaction by doing so.\n\n  There is a recent study by the Commonwealth Fund, published in Health \nAffairs, and it is reflected on this chart. It is hard to read because \nthe colors are too similar. What is reflected is that of those with \nprivate health insurance, there were 51 percent of those who were \nsatisfied, and 62 percent of those in traditional Medicare were \nsatisfied with their coverage. That is the case, despite the fact that \nMedicare benefits are less generous and its beneficiaries are more \nelderly and disabled and have higher health needs than individuals in \nthe private health care system.\n  So the bill seeks to move people out of traditional Medicare into \nprivate health plans. It does so by dramatically overpaying the private \nhealth plans.\n  Let me move to my second point. Since managed care is not more \nefficient than traditional Medicare, the conference report concludes \nthat the way to get people into these private health plans is to spend \nbillions of dollars in overpayment to those plans.\n  The legislation begins by setting its benchmark for payments to \nprivate plans at 109 percent of what Medicare fee for service would \nhave to spend for those beneficiaries. It does so in other ways as \nwell, including giving health plans money that Medicare otherwise would \npay to a disproportionate share of hospitals, to graduate medical \neducation, and the cost of veterans retiree health care.\n\n[[Page S15664]]\n\n  It makes no sense to me to subsidize and pay health plan payments \nthat Medicare intends, or could have, for safety net hospitals or \nteaching hospitals or veterans retirees. These HMOs do not provide \nunpaid services to the poor. They do not educate our Nation's medical \nstudents. They do not provide health care to our veterans. Yet the \nconference report provides payment for such services.\n  It makes no sense, but it is intended to camouflage the fact that \nprivate health plans cannot compete with traditional Medicare if they \nmerely receive the amount traditional Medicare spends to provide these \nservices to beneficiaries. So that is not enough.\n  The other thing that is done is that we, in this bill, provide a $10 \nbillion to $12 billion stabilization fund. That stabilization fund \nessentially is money that the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nhas available to add to what private plans are receiving and further \nadvantage them over the traditional Medicare system if he or she \ndetermines that that is necessary in order to keep them providing \nservices to this portion of our population.\n  Of course, the other issue that I think is extremely important is \nthat these private health plans, under the legislation, are fully free \nto engage in practices that allow them to enroll healthy Medicare \nbeneficiaries and shift the sicker and the more costly or elderly \nbeneficiaries into the Medicare system. They do this by adjusting their \nbenefits. They do this by designing their benefit packages and \nmarketing them to the healthy segments of the society.\n  Some might ask how do they do this. I will give you an example. Some \nprivate plans impose a higher cost share for services such as \nchemotherapy or renal dialysis than traditional Medicare in order to \nencourage those who have contracted cancer or renal failure to enroll, \nto leave the private plan and to go back into traditional Medicare.\n  Proponents of the bill say what they are trying to do by getting \nthese private plans involved is to foster competition. Obviously, we \nall favor competition, but I do not see that it is particularly \ncompetitive for us to provide this kind of very major subsidy.\n  When you add together the 109 percent payment to the private plans \nand the risk selection in which they are permitted to engage, private \nplans will be paid an estimated 25 percent more than the cost of \ntraditional Medicare for each enrollee, for each beneficiary. This \namounts to $1,920 more per enrollee in the year 2006.\n  A third problem is the bill actually does harm. I mentioned what many \nof my colleagues have already mentioned, and that is the 2.7 million \nretirees who are expected to lose their prescription drug coverage once \nwe enact this legislation.\n  Also, the Congressional Budget Office analysis says as to low-income \nbeneficiaries, there are 3.4 million low-income beneficiaries who will \nbenefit from this; there are 6.4 million low-income beneficiaries \ncurrently enrolled in Medicaid who will be worse off. It is hard for me \nto see how that adds up to a major benefit for a lot of those people \nwho are expecting a benefit under this legislation.\n  Let me talk a minute about drug costs. What will this bill do for \ndrug costs? When I talk with seniors in my State, the No. 1 problem \nthey cite to me when it comes to prescription drugs is the enormous \ngrowth in the cost of those drugs.\n  I have concluded, reluctantly, that not only will this legislation \nnot bring down drug costs but it will actually cause them to go up. \nSurveys indicate that Medicare beneficiaries cite this as their No. 1 \nproblem. The Congressional Budget Office has concluded the conference \nreport will actually raise the price of drugs by 3.5 percent overall.\n  The legislation that is before us, this 1,100 pages, delivers to \nhundreds of private drug companies and HMOs an insurance-administered \ndrug benefit that vastly dilutes the purchasing power of Medicare. \nRather than Medicare purchasing the drugs in bulk to achieve \nsignificant savings, the medication splits Medicare's purchasing power \ninto hundreds of purchasing pools and eliminates the significant \nleverage that Medicare could have in controlled costs.\n  This bill expressly prohibits Medicare from negotiating for prices. \nPeople need to focus on that. Here we are setting up a program where \nMedicare is going to pay for prescription drugs, and we are prohibiting \nMedicare from negotiating as to the price it is going to pay.\n  Consumers Union came out with a report last week saying the \nproposal's modest benefits, coupled with an expected high growth of \nprescription drug prices, could result in major disappointments for \nmany of these Medicare beneficiaries. Medicare beneficiaries at most \nprescription drug expenditure levels will actually face higher out-of-\npocket costs when they have coverage in 2007--that is one year after \nthe bill is implemented--than they do in 2003 when they have no \ncoverage.\n  That is an incredible finding, in my view. For example, it only \nprovides people with a benefit of around $1,000 for the first $5,000 in \nprescription drug spending. When you couple that with weak cost \ncontainment provisions, the Consumer Union finds that the average out-\nof-pocket spending for beneficiaries rises to $2,900 in 2000 compared \nto $2,300 in 2003 for beneficiaries with absolutely no prescription \ndrug coverage.\n\n  Let me also move to this final chart to talk about the problem of \ncomplexity and volatility. I heard some of the majority leader's \ncomments earlier this evening. He indicated that one of the great \nadvantages of this bill is that it would reduce paperwork. I would love \nto understand that. How we can enact this enormous piece of legislation \nand see it reduce paperwork is a mystery to me.\n  This is a chart that was put together by the Medicare Rights Center. \nIt tries to set out some depiction of how this is all going to work. I \ncan't begin to explain it to you at this point, but I can tell you that \nyou can study it for a great length of time and still not understand \nhow it is going to work.\n  Most people receiving benefits through Medicare choose traditional \nMedicare. They like the stability of traditional Medicare.\n  The Washington Post today had a story about the problems \nbeneficiaries who have enrolled in Medicare+Choice have encountered: \nthe changing benefits that health plans offer on an annual basis; the \nchanges in premiums and copayments; the problem of health plans coming \nin and out of the marketplace. We have had that problem in my State of \nNew Mexico. Health plans come in, advertise, sign up a lot of people, \nand 6 months or a year later they announce they are not making money \nand they pull out. They send a letter to everybody and say: Sorry, we \ndecided not to provide your benefits. Those people come to my office \nand say: What are we going to do?\n  This is a volatility in the system that most people on Medicare do \nnot appreciate. I see that increasing dramatically under this \nlegislation. How in the world we can see less paperwork, how in the \nworld we can see less complexity and less volatility as a result of \nthis bill escapes me.\n  A final point I want to make is the impact on States, expanding on \nthis concept of ``do no harm.'' This legislation has potentially major \nnegative consequences for our States. In the first 3 years of the bill, \nthe Congressional Budget Office estimates that the costs, or the \nunfunded liability of the bill to the States in their Medicaid \nprograms, will be $1.2 billion.\n  We are, in effect, adding $1.2 billion in costs to the Medicaid \nProgram at a time when States have been begging for relief from the \nFederal Government due to the growing Medicaid costs that States have \nexperienced because of the slow economy and the growing beneficiary \nroles.\n  States have had to make rather dramatic cuts in their Medicaid \nprograms because of these changes, and this $1.2 billion in additional \ncosts to them will result in additional cuts in Medicaid.\n  There is a misconception, I believe, about this legislation, and that \nis, people think that because Medicare is taking over the payment for \ndual-eligibles--that is low-income individuals who are eligible for \nMedicaid but also old enough to be eligible for Medicare--since \nMedicare is going to take over that expense, people think this is going \nto save the States money.\n  First of all, until the year 2008 under this legislation, States do \nnot receive any benefit from the Federal assumption of drug costs for \ndual-eligibles or\n\n[[Page S15665]]\n\nlow-income beneficiaries who currently get their prescription drugs \nfrom Medicaid. That is 5 years from now before they receive any \nbenefit. States expecting to get savings from this bill, in the words \nof the National Conference of State Legislatures, will be ``deeply \ndisappointed.''\n  In addition, this report contains what is called the clawback or the \nreverse block grant. This is a new concept to me, but it is a \nfascinating one. Instead of the Federal Government giving a block grant \nto the States, the Federal Government legislates a requirement on the \nStates to give the Federal Government a block grant.\n  It is through this clawback or reverse block grant the Federal \nGovernment demands that States pay the Federal Government for any \nsavings the Federal Government estimates the States might gain from the \nnew Medicare Program.\n  When we take the period between 2004 and 2013, the amount the States \nwill have to pay back to the Federal Government is $88.5 billion. Now, \nthat is a big number, $88.5 billion. The conference report requires \nStates to write checks to the Federal Government in the amount of $5.7 \nbillion in 2006. This goes up to $14.9 billion in 2013. Over that 7-\nyear period, that is a 261 percent increase in the amount the States \nhave to pay the Federal Government.\n  One may ask how they go up that much. It goes up that much because \nthe Federal Government has built into this a 15 percent compounded \ninflation rate, and that is being imposed on the States. The States \nhave nothing to say about it. If the States want to participate in \nMedicaid, they will pay that amount back to the Federal Government.\n  State general revenues, tax revenues, will not go up 15 percent \nannually during those 7 years. So States are rightfully upset by this \nclawback. They rightfully point out that they are being required to now \npay an inflation rate for something they do not control. The clawback, \nor the reverse block grant, is increasing by 261 percent over 7 years.\n  What this is going to do is to put increased pressure on State \nbudgets which will result in cuts in Medicaid, cuts in education, cuts \nin transportation. This should not be an acceptable outcome for those \nof us in the Senate. The bill we sent to the conference from the Senate \nloaded a $10 billion burden on the States. Now that it has come back to \nus, it has an $88 billion burden that we are loading on the States as \npart of this legislation.\n  I would add one other point about this burden. There is a group of 20 \nStates that have a cap that is imposed upon them through Medicaid's \ndisproportionate share hospital program. That cap says they can receive \nno more than 1 percent of the total Medicaid spending in their State. \nThat compares to 8 percent, which is the national average.\n  The 20 States I am talking about are called low-DSH States. New \nMexico is one of those States. I authored legislation to increase that \n1 percent to 3 percent, not to get it up to the national average, which \nwould have been 8 percent, but to get it up to 3 percent. That would \nhave allowed the disproportionate share hospitals in my State, instead \nof receiving $9 million a year, to receive a total of $45 million a \nyear.\n  Unfortunately, the conference report cut the amount my State would \nreceive from $45 million down to $10 million. Current law is $9 \nmillion. Under this bill, we would go to $10 million instead of going \nfrom $9 million to $45 million.\n  In sharp contrast, Louisiana's share of the Medicaid DSH funding goes \nfrom $500 million to $600 million next year. This is an unacceptable \ndisparity, in my view. Louisiana's $100 million increase is more than \nthe $43 million increase that is provided to all of the 20 low-DSH \nStates combined. This precludes States such as mine from protecting \ntheir safety net hospitals and dealing with the fact that the uninsured \nrate in our States has increased by 4 million people over the last 2 \nyears.\n  In conclusion, it is my view that Congress does its worst work under \nthe circumstances we are being presented with tonight and tomorrow. It \nis late in the session. There is no time for adequate review of the \n1,100 pages that have been put on each of our desks. We are being \npushed up against a totally artificial deadline. This is not the end of \nthe Congress. It is barely the middle of the Congress. There is no \nreason this bill has to be passed before we leave for Thanksgiving. We \ncould either come back after Thanksgiving or we could take it up in \nJanuary.\n\n  I have a letter from the Democratic Governors Association which says: \nWe urge you to reject any efforts to vote on this legislation before \nyou know its full content and cost impact on your State and the people \nwe both serve.\n  This is to all Members of the Senate from the Democratic Governors \nAssociation. They go on to say: Any rush to judgment without the \nnecessary information may have both short- and long-term consequences \nthat could prove to be irrevocably severe.\n  We do not know the consequences of this legislation that we are being \nurged to pass tomorrow. We owe it to senior citizens in this country to \nunderstand what we are doing. We owe it to the taxpayers of the country \nto buy health care services for seniors without overpaying for those \nhealth care services. We owe it to the public to do all we can to \nreduce health care costs. Unfortunately, we are doing none of these \nthings if we take up this bill and pass it tomorrow.\n  I hope Senators will join me in voting not to send this bill to the \nPresident in its present form.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first, I commend the Senator from New \nMexico for his analysis of this bill. I listened to the last part of it \nand I thought it was exactly on point. I particularly would like to \nemphasize his last point, which is that this is not the end of the \nCongress, this is just the end of a session, or nearing the end of a \nsession.\n  With 4 days' notice of a bill of this complexity--now, I think the \nbill itself is about 700 pages and there are hundreds of pages of \ncommentary that go with it, but the idea that we should take up a bill \nof this complexity, when seniors are just having the first opportunity \nafter 4 days to try to fathom what is in it, is a terrible mistake.\n  The Senator from New Mexico was exactly right in urging that we not \nrush to consider this bill tomorrow and to adopt this bill. It took a \ngreat deal of effort to create Medicare. It was not until 20 years \nafter Harry Truman first proposed the idea of a guaranteed health \nbenefit for seniors that President Lyndon Johnson signed the Medicare \nProgram into law. It was fitting that Harry Truman was the program's \nfirst beneficiary. He paid his $3 premium and he enrolled in Medicare \nin 1965.\n  We are confronting in this bill a turning away from Medicare's noble \npurpose. That purpose was to create an insurance pool for all seniors, \nwhere the risks and financial burdens are shared--not for the profit of \ninsurance companies or pharmaceutical companies but for the common \ngood. The legislation before us is a fundamental and ill-advised \nrestructuring of Medicare under the guise of adding a prescription drug \nbenefit to the program.\n  Many Members of Congress have worked for years to bring a Medicare \nprescription drug benefit to fruition. While the Senate-passed version \nof this bill had enough flaws to cause me, along with a number of \ncolleagues, to vote against it, at least I was hopeful that some of \nthese flaws would be corrected in the conference committee. \nUnfortunately, the prescription drug plan before us not only worsens \nthe prescription drug program as adopted by the Senate, it has become a \nmillstone dragging Medicare down with it.\n  The promise of a prescription drug plan is being used to begin the \nunraveling of Medicare. First, there are the dangers for seniors \ncreated by the prescription drug provisions themselves. The \nCongressional Budget Office estimates that up to 25 percent of \nretirees, with existing prescription drug coverage through a former \nemployer, would lose that coverage under this bill's plan. That is \nabout 2.7 million senior citizens who currently have good private \ninsurance and are paying less now than they would have to under a \nMedicare prescription drug plan. That is 2.7 million retirees who will \nlose benefits, above and beyond the number of retirees who are \nprojected to lose their benefits under the current trend of employers \nreducing prescription drug coverage for their retirees.\n\n[[Page S15666]]\n\nThe tax subsidies for employers included in this conference report are \nnot enough to entice employers to keep their drug coverage for those \n2.7 million retirees.\n\n  Another fundamental flaw with the prescription drug benefit in this \nlegislation is the lack of a guaranteed Medicare prescription drug \nplan. In the Senate bill, in the absence of two competing private plans \noffering a senior a prescription drug benefit, Medicare was the \nfallback. This approach was gutted in conference. Here is what the \nconference report provides. If one insurance company in a region offers \na prescription drug benefit, regardless of how unattractive it is to \nseniors in terms of its premiums and copayments, both of which are left \nup to the insurance company, and if an HMO offers coverage in that \nregion as a substitute to Medicare, no matter how unattractive that HMO \nis to seniors, and assuming that HMO also offers a prescription drug \nbenefit, the senior will not be offered the fallback Medicare \nprescription drug benefit.\n  Let me put that another way. We begin with the fact that private \ninsurance companies offering a prescription drug policy under this bill \ncould charge whatever premiums and copayments they want. If only one \nprivate prescription drug plan exists in a region, regardless of how \nunappealing it is, and one HMO offering a prescription drug plan also \nexists in that region, a senior has the choice of purchasing the bad \nprescription drug plan or leaving Medicare to join an HMO that he or \nshe does not want to join, in order to get that prescription drug \nbenefit. Forcing seniors to make the choice between staying in \ntraditional Medicare or leaving Medicare and joining an HMO they \notherwise would not join in order to get a prescription drug benefit is \na thinly disguised attempt to unravel and privatize Medicare. That is a \nchoice no senior citizen in America should have to make.\n  Also troubling is the fact that the private company which offers the \nprescription drug benefit, and the company which offers the managed \ncare alternative to Medicare, can be one and the same under the \nprovisions of this bill. In addition, the prescription drug benefit in \nthe legislation before us has a large gap in the prescription drug \ncoverage. Once a senior's total drug spending reaches about $2,500 for \nthe year, he or she will have to pay 100 percent of the cost of their \nprescriptions until their total drug spending reaches $3,600. This has \ncome to be called the donut hole. This coverage gap will leave many \nseniors to pay the full cost of prescriptions at a time when they most \nneed assistance. I know of no other insurance program that is so \nunfairly structured in that way.\n  Adding insult to injury, while there is a gaping hole in coverage, \nthere is no gap in the requirement to pay premiums. That obligation \ncontinues, even during the period that benefits are halted.\n  One of the most disturbing aspects of this legislation is the fact \nthat private insurance companies can use the purchasing power of their \nlarge number of beneficiaries to negotiate lower prescription drug \nprices, but Medicare is prohibited from doing so. This is one of the \nmost unacceptable ways this bill protects private insurance companies \nand prescription drug companies from fair competition from Medicare, \nall at the expense of seniors and American taxpayers.\n\n  Ask veterans how much prescription drugs cost at VA hospitals \ncompared to their local pharmacy. Many of the drugs the VA offers are \nas little as half the price. The reason is the VA buys drugs in large \nquantities from drug manufacturers and has leverage in negotiating the \nprices. Instead of buying the 30-day supply of pills for someone on \nMedicare, why not allow Medicare to buy thousands of 30-day supplies at \nonce for a fraction of the cost? That makes a lot of sense, but it is \nprohibited under this bill.\n  The conferees left out some other real solutions to address the high \ncost of prescription drugs. Both the House- and Senate-passed versions \nincluded a provision to allow seniors to buy drugs in other countries \nat lower prices, so-called reimportation provision. However, these \nprovisions have been stripped from the final bill. Even though the \nHouse and Senate have voted to allow reimportation with strong \nbipartisan votes, the conferees ignored these votes. More important, \nthey ignored the problem of high prescription drug costs. Americans pay \nmore for prescription drugs than any people in the world. U.S. \ntaxpayers' dollars help to subsidize the research and development of \nmany prescription drugs. Yet drug companies then sell them abroad for \nless. Because this bill does not address the high cost of prescription \ndrugs, needed medicine will still be inaccessible for millions of our \ncitizens.\n  Unfortunately, the prescription drug benefit in this bill is what \nNewt Gingrich envisioned for the future of the entire Medicare Program. \nThe former House Speaker said that he wanted Medicare to wither on a \nvine. To slowly chip away at the foundation of Medicare until it \ncrumbles with a private network of managed care and drug companies \neventually replacing Medicare is what he envisioned.\n  Apparently AARP, which once stood for preserving social insurance for \nAmerica's seniors, agrees with Mr. Gingrich. The AARP executive \ndirector and CEO wrote the forward to the former Speaker's book \nentitled ``Saving Lives and Saving Money,'' and later commented that \n``Newt's ideas are influencing how we at AARP are thinking about our \nnational role and in our advocating for system change.''\n  With this bill, the chief cooks of the Republican Party are following \nNewt Gingrich's ``wither on a vine'' recipe for the future of Medicare.\n  The six so-called premium support demonstration projects created by \nthis bill are the opening act for the privatization of Medicare. \nProponents argue that Medicare's costs won't come down without a \nprivate sector competitor. But this bill, while purporting to promote \ncompetition between Medicare and private insurers, tilts the playing \nfield against Medicare. First, there is a $12 billion so-called \nstabilization fund, which is in reality a slush fund. It is a slush \nfund for insurance companies to subsidize their policies. The $12 \nbillion in slush money is not available to traditional Medicare, only \nto the private insurance companies.\n  Second, the claims of the insurance industry that they will and must \naccept every senior who applies are disingenuous. Here is why. Private \ninsurers will have the flexibility to alter and change their plans, to \nbe able to cherry-pick the healthy senior. For example, if an insurance \ncompany designed a program with a very low monthly premium but with \nhigh copayments and high deductibles, this would be an incentive for a \nhealthy senior to enroll, someone who could risk having to pay high \ncopayments and deductibles because he or she has relatively infrequent \nmedical treatment. Less healthy seniors, whose frequent medical \ntreatments make it difficult or impossible for them to pay high \ncopayments and high deductibles, would be left for the Medicare program \nto cover. This is privatization plus. It simply cannibalizes Medicare. \nSubsidizing insurance companies and allowing them to cherry-pick the \nbeneficiary population means that insurance companies will be profiting \nmightily, while leaving the U.S. taxpayer to pick up the tab of \ninsuring the less profitable population.\n  How did we arrive at this ill-conceived legislation? Democrats were \nall but shut out of the conference committee which wrote this bill. \nOnly two Democrats were allowed to participate in the conference \nnegotiations. This massive shift in Medicare's approach and purpose was \ndelivered publicly to us about 4 days ago. In this bill's 700 pages are \nprovisions to dismantle Medicare as we know it, replacing it with a \nnetwork of private insurers and drug companies whose goal is making a \nprofit.\n\n  There is a fundamental difference between private industry and \ngovernment: Private companies fail if they do not make money, while \ngovernment fails if we do not help citizens--especially those that \ncannot help themselves.\n  I have heard from many of my constituents in the State of Michigan \nwho need help in getting affordable prescription drugs. Let me read you \na few excerpts from letters that I have received on this issue. One \nconstituent writes:\n\n       I am writing for your support for the Medicare Program. \n     Please provide a Medicare drug benefit that is comprehensive, \n     affordable and secure. Do not undermine Medicare\n\n[[Page S15667]]\n\n     as a defined benefit program through privatizing it.\n\n  Another constituent writes:\n\n       We do not want a drug bill that eliminates or reduces our \n     current prescription plan that we now have . . . When I \n     retired . . . this plan was part of my benefit package and we \n     fell that it is their obligation to continue it, and the cost \n     of our drugs should not be passed on to the tax payers.\n\n  I get hundreds of messages a week like that from constituents with \nconcerns over the privatizing of Medicare and the possible loss of \nexisting prescription drug benefits. It is estimated that this bill, if \nit becomes law, would cause 138,000 seniors in Michigan currently \nreceiving prescription drug benefits to lose some or all of those \nbenefits. And 90,000 seniors in my State who are Medicaid beneficiaries \nwith a current prescription drug coverage will be worse off if this \nbill becomes law than they are under current law.\n  A fundamental restructuring of Medicare of this magnitude demands \ncareful and thoughtful deliberation. The conference report contains a \nlarge amount of new material not included in either the House-passed or \nSenate-passed bills. Hastily acting on this legislation is \nfundamentally unfair to millions of seniors who want and deserve to be \ntreated fairly. I predict that when seniors become familiar with this \nbill's details, there will be a crescendo of opposition.\n\n  The siren song you hear now principally from our Republicans \ncolleagues is that competition is necessary to drive the cost of health \ncare down. The reality of this bill is not competition but government \nsubsidies for insurance companies while allowing them to carve out the \nmost profitable segment in the business--caring for the healthiest--\nleaving the seniors with greatest need as the responsibility of the \nFederal government. Privatizing the most profitable part with a subsidy \nis not competition; it is a huge gift to private companies at the \nexpense of the U.S. Treasury.\n  Supporters of this legislation say they are harnessing the power of \nthe marketplace to drive down prices. The reality is just the opposite. \nThey are hobbling the Medicare program in the prescription drug program \nby letting the private provider use its purchasing power to drive down \nits drug prices, but not letting Medicare do the same; and in the \ndismantling of Medicare, by pushing people out of Medicare into private \nHMOs in order to obtain a prescription drug benefit.\n  The bill before us will begin undoing 37 years of progress in \nMedicare. It is an ill-advised assault on the one program that \nguarantees medical care to our most vulnerable population, our senior \ncitizens. An historic opportunity is being squandered if we adopt this \nbill. Our Nation's seniors deserve better. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/23/senate-section/article/S15667-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15667]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9 A.M.
