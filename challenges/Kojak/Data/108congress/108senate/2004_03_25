Mr. President, I have a simple request for the President \ntoday: Please ask the people around you to stop the character attacks \nthey are waging against Richard Clarke. Ask them to stop their attempts \nto conceal information and confuse facts. Ask them to stop the long \neffort that has made the 9/11 Commission's work more difficult than it \nshould be.\n  Regardless of whether one agrees or disagrees with Mr. Clarke's \nfacts, he set an eloquent example for all of us yesterday. He \nacknowledged to the families of the victims of September 11 that their \nGovernment had failed them. He accepted responsibility for September \n11. He made himself accountable and he tried, in my view, to help us \nunderstand what happened in the months and years before September 11. I \ncould not be more disappointed in the White House response. They have \nknown for months what Mr. Clarke was going to say. Instead of dealing \nwith it factually, they have launched a shrill attack to destroy Mr. \nClarke's credibility.\n  I know something about those attacks.\n  On several occasions, I have been on the receiving end of the White \nHouse\n\n[[Page S3120]]\n\nbroadsides. I saw the White House ferocity firsthand. I saw the people \naround the President attack John McCain when he ran for President in \n2000. I will never forget the distortions, the recklessness, and the \nviciousness of those attacks. They were wrong and they impugned one of \nour great patriots.\n  I saw the same viciousness 2 years ago when Senator Max Cleland, a \nman who served when called during the Vietnam war, had his reputation \nand patriotism smeared in his reelection campaign. The idea that a man \nwho gave so much to his country could be smeared by those who are \nwilling to give so little haunted me then as it haunts me now. There \nare some things that simply ought not to be done in politics, and that \nline was crossed by attacks on both Senator McCain and Senator Cleland.\n  Last year, I watched the people around the President set their sights \non Ambassador Joe Wilson when he stepped forward to tell the truth \nabout the President's claims on Iraq, Niger, and uranium. The White \nHouse did not battle Ambassador Wilson on the facts. Instead, they put \nhis wife's life in danger by disclosing publicly that she was a deep \ncover agent for the CIA. That was a grossly irresponsible act done for \nthe worst of reasons--to avoid accountability and unwelcome political \nconsequences. It ought never have happened. It was shameful, and it \ncrossed a line that had never been crossed before.\n  Now when I watch what the people around the President are trying to \ndo to Richard Clarke, I think it is past time to say enough is enough.\n  The President came to Washington 4 years ago promising to change the \ntone. The people around him have done that. They have changed it for \nthe worse. They are doing things that should never be done and have \nnever been done before. What they need to do, what we all need to do, \nis to put politics aside and put the American people and their security \nfirst.\n  I know how difficult that is in an election year, but we all, every \none of us needs to do exactly that. Some things are more important than \npolitics, and September 11 ought to be at the top of the list. We need \nthe facts on September 11, not spin and not character assassination. We \nneed this administration and everyone involved to follow Mr. Clarke's \nexample and accept responsibility and accountability.\n  We need Condoleezza Rice, who seems to have time to appear on every \ntelevision show, to make time to appear publicly before the 9/11 \nCommission. She is not constrained by precedent from doing that, as the \nWhite House has argued. As the Congressional Research Service \ndocumented, two of her predecessors have given testimony in open \nsession on matters much less important than September 11.\n  I have reluctantly reached the conclusion that what really constrains \nMs. Rice's full cooperation is political consideration. The September \n11 families deserve better than that and, just as importantly, our \ncountry deserves better.\n  There is only one person who can change what is going on at the White \nHouse, and that is the President. So I appeal to President Bush to \nchange it. He deserves better than the tactics his staff are using and, \nas I have said, the September 11 families and our country deserve \nbetter, too.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Would the Senator allow me to ask him a question through \nthe Chair?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I have listened to the statement of the Democratic leader. \nI acknowledge what happened to Senator McCain and the tragedy with Max \nCleland, but one thing I did not hear the leader mention was what was \ndone to Paul O'Neill when he published his book, ``The Price of \nLoyalty,'' a man who is a certified, card-carrying conservative \nRepublican, one of the great businessmen in the history of our country, \nwho in effect was trashed for what he thought was good for the country.\n  I heard the Senator describe Joe Wilson and what was done to his wife \nand Richard Clarke, but the one thing the leader undersold--in keeping \nwith the modesty of the minority leader and I want the record to \nreflect--is what has happened to the leader. By virtue of the fact that \n48 other Democrats, in a period of over 10 years, have selected the \nSenator from South Dakota as our leader, as a result of that the \nSenator does things for the caucus. I am sure the caucus is not 100-\npercent headed in the right direction, but we do our best to try to, \nand when there is ever anything that is done that is not in keeping \nwith what this White House wants, the leader is attacked, his family is \nattacked, his religion is attacked, his ethics are attacked. For those \nof us who serve with the Senator from South Dakota, we know what a \nwonderful family he has, what a loving family he has, what a moral \nperson he is, and what a good leader he is.\n  I want the record to reflect that the Senator from South Dakota has \ntremendously undersold--all of these people we have mentioned who have \nbeen brutally assaulted, in my opinion, do not compare with what has \nhappened to Tom Daschle himself.\n  I want the Senator to know that the entire caucus stands behind him \nfor the great leader he has been, and we apologize for what has \nhappened to him by virtue of the fact that he is our leader. If he were \nnot our leader, someone else would be attacked; their religion would be \nattacked; their families would be attacked. Speaking for 48 other \nDemocrats, we all admire and respect the work the Senator from South \nDakota has done and are sorry that he has had to take the blows he has \nby being one of the great leaders in the history of our country.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the Senator from Nevada for his very kind words, \nand I thank my colleagues for yielding the floor to accommodate my \nleader time this morning.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/25/senate-section/article/S3120-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3120]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I take a few minutes today to talk about \nan issue I am sure we are all concerned about and interested in. As I \ngo about Wyoming and talk to people, particularly in town meetings, the \nissue that arises most often and with the most passion is the high cost \nof health insurance. The cost of health insurance is directly related \nto the cost of health care. What we hear the most about is from people \nwho are in private business, farmers and ranchers, who provide all of \ntheir own health care costs, which have become increasingly \nprohibitive. It seems to me we are going to have to focus properly on \nMedicare, Medicaid, veterans, those government programs for which we \nare responsible. I suggest we need to focus now and begin to take a \nlook at the broader picture of health care. We have a system that has \navailable certainly some of the best health care in the world, but the \nkey is to have access. If the cost limits access, we have a problem.\n  We have some unique features in Wyoming. Because of a small \npopulation, we cannot have all the various professional services in \nevery small town. There has to be a system. We have worked at that. \nThere are several hospitals with the different kinds of specialties \nthat help serve communities. We have had more and more critical access \nfacilities which make it easier for small communities to work.\n  I visited Dubois, WY, this week, a new clinic to a small town. I also \nmet with a group of physicians and hospital operators in Cheyenne. We \ntalked about some of these issues. Before it was over, these \nprofessionals, these providers, indicated they agree this system is \nbroken and there needs to be some kind of change made in the future. I \ndon't know the answer. I don't know that anyone yet knows the answer. I \nsuggest to my fellow Members of the Senate and the House, we need to \nbegin to take a look.\n  If I can start out by saying I am not one who favors a Federal \nsocialized medicine program, we need to find some ways to do something \nwith what we have now.\n  National health expenditures grew $1.6 trillion in 2002, a 9.3-\npercent increase over the previous year. The costs of health care \ngenerally have gone up 15 percent a year for several years.\n  It is hard to sustain 15-percent growth, particularly when, \nincreasingly, health care for families is a relatively large portion of \nexpenditures.\n  Health care as a share of GDP in 2002 was 14.9 percent, up from 14.1 \npercent in 2001. So we are seeing substantial increases. And over the \nyears those increases have continued.\n  So one has to ask, if the costs are going up 15 percent a year, how \nlong can you sustain that? What do we need to do? Folks are seeing \ndouble-digit premium increases each year, including Federal employees. \nSo it is quite obvious to me that we cannot continue to grow rates at \nthat level.\n  I indicated I had talked to some folks who certainly agree we need to \ndeal with that. We face more challenges in the health care system than \njust reforming the public programs or addressing the nearly 42 million \npeople--15 percent--who do not have health insurance.\n  There are some things, of course, we need to consider. We need to \nimprove the underlying health care infrastructure. Its rising costs \naffect all of us. I think we have to take some of the responsibility \nfor fixing that system.\n  We have a health care system today where, for instance, hospital \ncharges do not reflect the actual costs because of public and private \ninsurance reimbursements. I recently met with a hospital CEO in my \nhometown. At that hospital they had some very interesting topics they \ntalked about. Their gross charges, for example, were $202 million; $80 \nmillion was written off; $120.7 million reflects actual costs; $1.4 \nmillion was income from insurance, and they had $3.3 million in other \nincome. This is not a large profit margin.\n  What does that mean? No. 1, Medicare does not pay to the level of \nactual costs. Now, you may say, well, we need to keep the cost of \nMedicare down. That is true. On the other hand, if their payment is not \nequal to the cost, then someone else has to bear the cost; Medicaid \neven more so.\n  Medicaid pays even a smaller percentage of the actual cost than does \nMedicare. This is a combination, of course, of State and Federal \nprograms. So we find that situation.\n  Charity, for those who are uninsured, for those who come in and are \nnot able to pay, we still take them, of course. Trauma care, sometimes, \nis reimbursed by the county or the State. But if someone has an \naccident and arrives at the hospital, they are given care, of course, \nwhether they have the ability to pay, whether they have insurance. And \nguess who pays the principal cost of that. Those who have insurance.\n  People who are insured represent about 35 percent of the people in a \nhospital, but they pay 98 percent of the cost. So what we are doing \nbasically is taking the costs that are there, and those who have \ncommercial insurance are paying a very large percentage of that cost. \nTherefore, we are shifting costs from the broad user base to a \nrelatively small group who buy insurance, which causes the private \ninsurance to be higher.\n\n  So there are some weaknesses there. Certainly, we have to do \nsomething about it. Health providers must shift this cost to private \ninsurance or they do not make it up.\n  Emergency room costs, of course, are extremely expensive. They are \nused a great deal, particularly with Medicaid where there is no first-\ndollar payment by anyone. When anything goes wrong for someone who is \nunder Medicaid, they can go to the emergency room because it does not \ncost anything.\n  Of course, we pay the highest prices for prescription drugs and \nshoulder the research and development costs for\n\n[[Page S3122]]\n\nmuch of the rest of the world. I think most of us are working on that \nissue. I think we are going to have a hearing next week in the Finance \nCommittee to see if there is any relationship in terms of the trade \naspect of it--with Canada, for example, where you can send goods from \nthis country that cost a certain amount, and the Government up there \nsays they will cost less. Is that part of a trade problem? I think it \nis something we ought to talk about.\n  Also, of course, one of the things we have tried to fix--and I hope \nwe continue to try to do something about it--is putting a limit on \nnoneconomic damages for liability in health care. We have tried to pass \nthat. We tried to pass it in the Wyoming Legislature. I think, \nhopefully, they will continue to do that.\n  But what it has done in our State--and I think in a number of other \nStates--is it certainly has raised the costs because the cost for \nmalpractice insurance for practioners has gone up a great deal. It has \nalso caused some practitioners, particularly OB/GYNs, to not serve any \nlonger. Again, in a State such as ours, where there may be just one \nprovider in a community, if that person does not provide services, then \nthere is no one there and people have to go miles and miles to find \ncare.\n  So it has a great impact. Not only is it the impact of increased \ncosts to the provider, which he or she passes on to his or her \npatients, but it also has caused practices to be quite different and to \nbe overly general about care. A number of years ago, if you hurt your \narm, you would go to a general practitioner, he would fix it, put a \ncast on it, and you would go home. Now you would go in and: Oh, my \ngosh, you hurt your arm? You better see an arm specialist. We need to \ntake some tests. We need to have an MRI and a few other things--all of \nwhich make care more expensive than it used to be. Some of that cost is \nsimply for protection against malpractice lawsuits. So that is one of \nthe things we can do.\n  We are seeing more and more small businesses being unable and \nunwilling to help provide health care for their employees. So there are \nall kinds of different problems that have arisen.\n  I think people, also, are probably less responsible for their own \nhealth. This idea that we should take care of ourselves a little better \nto avoid sickness--everyone agrees with that idea, but not everyone \nparticipates in that. So, again, we have some things that could be \nchanged.\n  I met a gentleman who is promoting a new program, running a new \nprogram called Be-well. It is a program for employers who create health \ncontracts with their employees under the proposition that the employer \nsays to the employee: I am willing and able to cover your health care \nexpense, your insurance expense. However, you must agree to do some \nthings for your own health. You need to agree to exercise. You need to \nagree to do some things. You need to agree to this Be-Well program.\n  Most everyone agrees with that idea, but often there is not any real \nincentive to do that. This program provides an incentive to people to \nbe more responsible for themselves.\n  So we face some real challenges. Physicians and providers are \nretiring earlier because of some of these pressures. Hospital vacancy \nrates for registered nurses, radiology technicians, and pharmacists \nhave reached more than 10 percent. There are a number of hospitals that \nface rather severe shortages. We are also facing dental shortages. \nAgain, in low population States, we are seeing the dental providers \nbecoming an older group. Many are soon to retire. Frankly, there are \nnot enough people standing in line waiting to replace them. We are \nworking on trying to get a multistate dental training arrangement and \nalso urging some assistance for underserved areas in this area as well.\n  So what I am interested in seeing is if we can start a little dialog \non the broader issues that affect health care and health care costs and \nthe ability to have access to health care for people in this country.\n  I will continue to work on this issue. We have been very involved in \nour office on rural health care. We are very pleased with some of the \nthings that were done in the bill that we passed last year for \nMedicare.\n  I was very pleased that we passed that bill. To be sure, it is not \nfinalized, but it is a first step in 30-some years to begin making \nchanges. So we have had changes taking place with people but not a lot \nof changes in terms of how we provide health care.\n  Last year we had a forum on rural health care which is a little \nunique, but some of the problems are the same. We began to discuss \nthose problems and to look to the future. That is what we have to ask, \nwhat is health care going to look like 5 or 10 years from now, if we \ncan make that sort of projection, and then begin to look at what we can \ndo to get where we want it to be rather than where we think it will be \nif we do nothing.\n  There are some ideas out there. I don't suggest they are all the \nbest, but some are being talked about--tax credits to have a medical \nsetaside for payments that you could keep tax free and then use it. In \nmany cases you could use it for the first dollar cost, and then all you \nhave to buy is a higher level insurance, which is much cheaper, \ncatastrophic insurance, rather than the first low dollar, which is much \nmore expensive. We are going to be working on a better medical savings \nprogram.\n  Association health plans have been talked about. The idea of \ninsurance is to get enough people into the package so you can level out \nthe cost between those who are less healthy and those who are more \nhealthy. But if you do not have large numbers, that doesn't happen. \nThere is some objection to that in terms of the States. I am not \nnecessarily supporting all these ideas. But, for example, if you were a \nservice station operator, you could be part of a national service \nstation operators insurance program.\n  Some have talked about the idea that everyone, even if they had to be \nhelped, should have insurance. We require insurance on your car. We \ndon't require it, but somebody else has to pay for it. So that is \nsomething we should talk about.\n  Better education efforts for consumers to make healthier choices, \ncertainly that is something we ought to take seriously.\n  As I mentioned, medical malpractice reform is clearly something we \nought to do. We, obviously, have been blocked in the Senate from doing \nthat.\n  There are a lot of issues we need to look at, and they deal with \nwhere we are going to be in a few years and where we are now. But we \nwill be worse off in a few years unless we begin to deal with some of \nthose issues.\n  I appreciate the time and look forward to continuing to have the \ndebate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I say to my good friend from Wyoming, \nbefore he leaves the floor, I share his frustration over our failure to \nact on any kind of medical malpractice reform. We have tried a broad \napproach. We have tried a narrow approach. We will be back again to try \nanother narrow approach. We can't even seem to get cloture on the \nmotion to proceed. That is how dug in the Senate seems to be against \nany effort to lower those liability insurance premiums for doctors. The \nSenator from Wyoming brings up a very important issue. I thank him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/25/senate-section/article/S3122-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3122-S3123]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             RICHARD CLARKE\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I come to the Chamber this morning to \ntalk about Richard Clarke's testimony yesterday.\n  We all now know who Richard Clarke is. He has sort of burst on the \nnational scene with his effort to defeat President Bush. Richard Clarke \nwas the man in charge of counterterrorism under the previous \nadministration for 8 years. During those 8 years, we had three \nterrorist attacks against America: In 1993, the first attack against \nthe World Trade Center in New York; against the U.S. Embassies in \nAfrica in 1998; and against the USS Cole in 2000.\n  The most aggressive action, apparently, Mr. Clarke was able to \nconvince his superiors to take during those years was to launch a few \ncruise missiles at a single terrorist camp in Afghanistan and take out \na pharmaceutical factory in Sudan--not a really robust response to \nmultiple terrorist acts against American interests both in the United \nStates and overseas.\n  Now Mr. Clarke has the gall to come forward and suggest that \nPresident\n\n[[Page S3123]]\n\nBush was not particularly interested in the war on terrorism or in \ngoing after al-Qaida. But interestingly enough, back in an August 2002 \ninterview with the news media, Mr. Clarke himself said the Bush \nadministration, in the spring of 2001, sought to increase CIA resources \nfor covert action fivefold to go after al-Qaida. Back in 2002, he was \nsinging an entirely different tune than he was portraying either in his \ntestimony yesterday before the 9/11 Commission or in his new book, \nwhich I am sure he hopes will be a best seller and help defeat \nPresident Bush.\n  But before he had some epiphany and went in a different direction, in \nAugust 2002, he said the Bush administration plan was actually more \naggressive than Clinton's, and that the Bush administration changed the \nstrategy from one of rollback by al-Qaida over the course of 5 years, \nwhich it had been under the Clinton years, to a new strategy that \ncalled for the rapid elimination of the al-Qaida terrorist network.\n  That is what Mr. Clarke was saying in August of 2002--quite different \nfrom what he said yesterday before the 9/11 Commission or in his new \nbook.\n  Also in this August 2002 interview, Clarke noted the Bush \nadministration, in mid-January of 2001--before the 9/11 attack--decided \nto do two things to respond to the threat of terrorism: ``One, to \nvigorously pursue the existing policy, including all the lethal covert \naction finds which we have now made public, to some extent; the second \nthing the administration decided to do was to initiate a process to \nlook at these issues which had been on the table for a couple of years \nand get them decided.''\n  In other words, what Clarke was saying in 2002 to members of the \npress was that the Bush administration's response to the war on terror \nwas much more aggressive than it was under the Clinton years.\n  Now he is singing an entirely different tune. This is a man who lacks \ncredibility. He may be an intelligent man, he may be a dedicated public \nservant, but clearly he has a grudge of some sort against the Bush \nadministration. If he was unable to develop a more robust response \nduring the Clinton years, he would only be able to blame himself. He \nwas in charge of counterterrorism during those 8 years. How could the \nBush administration be to blame in 8 months for the previous \nadministration's failure over 8 years to truly declare war on al-Qaida?\n  Let me be clear, I do not believe the Clinton administration is \nresponsible for September 11. Rather, I believe Osama bin Laden and his \nal-Qaida terrorist network are responsible. I also believe there exist \nother terrorists organizations that share al-Qaida's goal of murdering \ninnocent civilians who oppose their violent and extremist ideology. \nThese terrorists don't hate us because of our policies. They hate us \nbecause of who we are. And if we don't work together to bring the fight \nto the terrorists, they will almost certainly bring it to us.\n  Bringing the fight to the terrorists is, of course, exactly what \nPresident Bush has been doing.\n  Instead of partisan finger-pointing, we should instead be working to \nbolster our intelligence infrastructure, continue our aggressive \nefforts to monitor, apprehend and bring to justice terrorists around \nthe world, and improve our ability to defend America and its ideals \nfrom attack.\n  Although work remains to be done, I believe the Bush administration \nhas made truly admirable progress in the war on terrorism. Who could \nargue with a straight face that America is not safer today than it was \non September 10, 2001? The Taliban is gone. Saddam Hussein is gone.\n  We have destroyed all--not just one--all of al-Qaida's training camps \nin Afghanistan. All of them are gone from that country.\n  We have apprehended or killed two-thirds of al-Qaida's leaders.\n  We have launched international efforts to make it difficult for \nterrorists to raise or transfer their funds to fund their deadly \nactivities.\n  We have worked with allies across the world to break up al-Qaida \ncells and other terrorist networks.\n  We passed the PATRIOT Act, which provides U.S. law enforcement better \ncapabilities to monitor, apprehend, and bring to justice terrorists \nplotting in the United States.\n  We have won new allies in Pakistan and Uzbekistan. And by engaging \nthese countries we have scored further victories against terrorists.\n  As I said earlier, there has been the end of the regime of Saddam \nHussein who provided direct material support to Palestinian terrorists \nand who offered safe haven to other Islamic terrorists.\n  We have rounded up and continue to kill foreign terrorists in Iraq. \nThese terrorists would rather be blowing up buses in midtown Manhattan. \nBelieve me, that is where the terrorists would rather be on the attack. \nInstead they are in Iraq. That is where the war on terror is going on, \nright in Iraq.\n  While we mourn the loss of every American soldier and innocent Iraqi \ncitizen, we are glad we are dealing with al-Qaida over in the Middle \nEast and not on American soil.\n  Finally, I think it is important to remember what is happening in \nLibya. Prime Minister Blair is meeting with the Libyan leader today. He \nhas been somewhat born again. He is now denouncing terrorism. His \nweapons of mass destruction are now being eliminated.\n  It is noteworthy that Qadhafi seemed to have gotten religion in March \n2003, the same month we launched the invasion of Iraq, and seemed to \nhave fully converted shortly after Saddam Hussein was found hiding in a \nhole. Clearly, our Iraq policy is helping reduce or eliminate rogue \nregimes with weapons of mass destruction.\n  Let me conclude by saying by any objective standard, the war on \nterrorism is going well. I think Mr. Clarke's efforts to convince the \nAmerican public somehow President Bush was inattentive to the war on \nterror or obsessed with Iraq are simply foolish and erroneous and will \nnot be believed by the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski).

Madam President, I rise today to discuss the war on \nterrorism and the situation in Iraq on the 1-year anniversary of \nOperation Iraqi Freedom.\n  I had the honor and privilege of traveling to Iraq and Afghanistan \nover the recent recess to visit our troops. I had the similar honor of \nvisiting them in the medical center at Ramstein, Germany.\n  I report to my colleagues the troops with whom I met were in good \nspirits. They are, of course, eager to return home to their loved ones, \nbut they are also proud of the work they are doing to stabilize Iraq \nand assist the Iraqi people in building a democratic state. I was proud \nof them, proud of the leadership of our military, and proud of all the \ntroops there.\n  As a veteran of World War II, I was proud to see in the troops the \nsame dedication to duty, mission, and country I remember so well from \nmy own comrades in arms. In Ramstein, I was impressed with the \nwonderful support our wounded were receiving from the medical staff, \nand I was equally impressed with the eagerness our wounded expressed to \nreturn to the sides of their comrades. In that eagerness to rejoin \ntheir units, they shared a bond with all their past brothers in \nuniform.\n  In Iraq, I visited the newly deployed Stryker brigade in Mosul. This \nunit is demonstrating in the field for the first time a powerful new \ncapability. But it has also been given the difficult objective of \npatrolling a large area. They are still waiting for Iraqi forces to be \ntrained and adequately equipped to supplement their effort. Clearly, \none reason why the security situation still remains so tenuous is the \nfailure to train and field sufficient Iraqi security forces. But the \napparent ambush of two American civilians recently by Iraqi police \nindicates even some of the newly deployed security forces cannot be \ntrusted.\n  According to the Coalition Provisional Authority, or CPA, we are only \nabout 30,000 short of the approximately 236,000 security forces planned \nfor Iraq. This may be so in terms of absolute numbers, but it is not a \nreflection of how well equipped they are, how well trained they are, \nand how well led they are.\n  For example, the CPA carries about 60,000 police on payroll, but only \n2,300 of those have been fully qualified.\n\n[[Page S3124]]\n\nPrior to the war, the Iraqi police had a well-deserved reputation for \nbeing corrupt. Reports continue to indicate this remains a problem and, \nas I mentioned, there are indications the security forces have been \ninfiltrated by terrorists. At the same time, many of the honest \npolicemen are being targeted by terrorists. On Tuesday, 11 were killed \nin an ambush. So one should view numbers with a healthy skepticism and \nfocus on quality.\n  I also had the opportunity to visit Balad, about 25 miles north of \nBaghdad. This will become the future center of air operations in Iraq, \nand we are now preparing a major airbase to service American troops for \nthe next 3 to 5 years.\n  Elsewhere, there is the intent to move American troops out of Baghdad \nand consolidate forces in fewer installations on the periphery, thus \nreducing the visibility of the American footprint. This is going to be \na very delicate maneuver. Reducing the American presence in Baghdad has \nto be balanced by an increase in the effectiveness of Iraqi security \nforces inside the city. We could run the risk of having that city of \nabout 6 million become an even safer haven for terrorists while we \nhunker down in bases on the outskirts.\n  It also means we are planning for an extended stay in Iraq. While the \nadministration indicates 33 countries are now contributing troops to \nIraq, the bulk of the troops is American, and unless there is a change \nin strategy by the administration or a change in attitude by the \ninternational community, those troops for the foreseeable future will \nremain largely American.\n  Will there be American troops in Iraq by the time of the next \nPresidential election in 2008? Right now the answer is yes.\n  I was able to visit Kabul as well. So much attention and money have \nbeen focused on Iraq that I believe Afghanistan has been neglected to \nthe detriment of our goal of defeating the terrorists who attacked us \non 9/11.\n  One example: in Iraq we hope to field an army of 27 battalions in 12 \nmonths at a cost of $1.8 billion, while in Afghanistan we hope to field \nan army of 15 battalions in 26 months at a cost of $569 million. Yet, \nin Iraq, there is a military infrastructure of garrisons, facilities, \nand a history of a national army that Afghanistan lacks. There are huge \ncultural barriers to overcome in linguistics and ethnicity that make \nIraq look homogenous in comparison. Our military is doing a great job \nin trying to stand up an army in Afghanistan, but it is an enormous \njob, and so far the international community is not providing sufficient \nresources either to rebuild the country or create a sustainable and \nprofessional security force.\n  Afghanistan has an even greater problem in the lack of a civic \nadministrative infrastructure. Without the creation of a strong local \nand central government, we run the risk of creating a well trained army \nthat the government cannot pay for or sustain, further increasing the \nrisk that the Taliban and al-Qaida terrorists could return to power.\n  We need to give more attention and make a greater commitment to \nAfghanistan. In Kosovo, for example, 25 times more money was pledged on \na per capita basis than to Afghanistan and 50 times more troops per \ncapita were sent. Afghanistan needs an estimated $20 billion in \nassistance over the next 5 years but so far only $7 billion has been \npledged and even less received. I worry that, 2 years after the fall of \nthe Taliban, Afghanistan has become the forgotten war even as al-Qaida \nterrorists and Taliban remnants continue to make it their sanctuary and \nregroup their forces.\n  I opposed going to war in Iraq when we did. I did not think that the \nthreat posed by weapons of mass destruction was imminent, nor did I \nthink we had taken sufficient time to prepare for the consequences of a \nprolonged occupation of Iraq. I was concerned that starting another \nconflict before we had squashed the al-Qaida terrorist threat in \nAfghanistan would disperse our forces and expose us to even more \nterrorist problems. To be successful in both, with the least cost to \nthe United States in terms of lives and resources, required an \ninternational coalition and consensus along the lines of the one \ncreated in the first gulf war. We have yet to achieve that either in \nAfghanistan, where there is international support but insufficient \nresources, or in Iraq where the bulk of resources and personnel are \nbeing provided by the United States.\n  We need to rebuild support for American foreign policy both abroad \nand at home. A recent Pew Foundation poll indicates that the U.S. image \nabroad remains negative in most nations. This cannot be good. For \nAmericans to be secure, we need to be respected, and, as both Iraq and \nAfghanistan demonstrate, we cannot go it alone unless American citizens \nwant to bear the full burden of sacrifice. We need international \nsupport. This does not mean sacrificing American interests to foreign \ninterests, but it means working with other nations to gain a consensus \nin support of our objectives. In many we are one.\n  At home, too, we need to rebuild bipartisan support for American \nforeign policy. This has been lost in the last few years. Healthy \ndebate requires a willingness to listen to arguments and to accept \nthose that are valid in order to develop a consensus on American \nforeign policy. This ability has been lost.\n  Earlier this week, our former colleague, Bill Cohen, spoke before the \n9/11 Commission. He talked about ``the kind of poisonous atmosphere \nthat existed then that continues today,'' referring to the questioning \nof President Clinton's motives when he launched attacks against al-\nQaida in Afghanistan and Sudan. Constructive criticism of strategy and \noversight of its implementation are essential tools in sharpening the \ntip of our policy weapons. But they need to take place in an atmosphere \nwhere such debate is not just another arrow in the quiver of partisan \npolitics.\n  I pray that one of the successes of the 9/11 Commission and other \ndiscussions in this very political year will be a determination to \nrestore comity in foreign policy.\n  My recent travels in Iraq and Afghanistan have convinced me that, if \nwe are to succeed in either country, we need to be prepared to remain \nin both countries for a long time, and we need to be prepared for \nadditional sacrifices in terms of lives and financial resources. To \naccept that burden, there has to be a consensus in foreign policy. To \nbear that burden will require a determination to establish \ninternational support for our policies.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the hour of 10:30 \nhaving arrived, the Senate will proceed to the consideration of H.R. \n1997, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1997) to amend title 18, United States Code, \n     and the Uniform Code of Military Justice to protect unborn \n     children from assault and murder, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, I come to the floor this morning to \nbegin the debate on the Unborn Victims of Violence Act. I would like \nfirst to thank our 40 cosponsors for their leadership and support on \nthis issue.\n  Let me also thank specifically Senator Lindsey Graham, who championed \nthis issue on the House side for a number of years before he joined us \nhere in the U.S. Senate. He has worked tirelessly to see to it that the \nmost vulnerable members of our society are, in fact, protected.\n  Let me also thank our lead House sponsors, Congresswoman Melissa Hart \nfrom Pennsylvania, and my friend and colleague from the State of Ohio, \nCongressman Steve Chabot. They have both been great champions of this \ngreat cause. They worked tirelessly to help get this important bill \npassed in the House of Representatives.\n\n[[Page S3125]]\n\n  Our bill is very simple. I will take just a couple of minutes to \nexplain it. It is a bill about simple justice. It is a bill about doing \nwhat is right. I was asked yesterday by one of my colleagues, Why do we \nneed this bill? Why is this bill on the floor?\n  This is what I responded yesterday and this is what I would say to my \ncolleagues here in the Senate this morning. Imagine a pregnant woman in \na national park or a pregnant woman on an Air Force base and she is \nviolently assaulted. As a result of that assault, she loses her child; \nthat child dies. Today, there is no Unborn Victims of Violence Act. \nToday, unless that Federal park or Air Force base is located in a State \nthat has a similar law, a Federal prosecutor would search the Federal \nstatute books in vain to find anything to charge that assailant for the \ndeath of that child, for the death of that unborn infant, the fetus. \nThe only thing that Federal prosecutor would be able to charge that \ndefendant with is the assault of the woman. The death of that child \nwould not be able to be charged as what we would think would be a \nseparate offense. Justice would not be done for that, what we would \nthink would be a separate offense.\n  This bill corrects that. This bill recognizes there are two victims. \nThere is the victim, the mother, who was assaulted; and there is the \nvictim, the unborn child, who was either injured or killed. It is that \nsimple.\n  This bill recognizes when someone attacks and harms a mother and her \nunborn child that attack does in fact result in two separate victims: \nthe mother and her child. That is what this bill does.\n  I will have more to say about this bill later. I will reserve the \nremainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2858\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I would like to call up amendment \n2858.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n  The Senator from California [Mrs. Feinstein] for herself and Mr. \nLautenberg, Mr. Bingaman, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. Corzine, \nproposes an amendment numbered 2858.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I agree with virtually everything \nthe Senator from Ohio has said. Although there are many State laws \nwhich do take into consideration a fetus, it is true that the Federal \nlaws, which would impact only those on Federal property, are silent. I \nam in complete concurrence with everything the Senator has said. I have \nhad the privilege of working with him, so it is a delight for me to be \nable to discuss and debate this issue with him.\n  The substitute amendment I have called up is on behalf of Senators \nBingaman, Boxer, Corzine, Kennedy and Lautenberg. I would like to make \nclearer a couple of places in that amendment.\n\n[[Page S3126]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to send a modification to the desk.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I hear the objection. I am rather surprised by the \nobjection. It is generally common courtesy to allow a Senator to amend \nhis or her amendment. However, I believe our amendment is clear on its \nface.\n  I would like to point out that since 2000, in the Senate, there has \nbeen no hearing on this amendment and no opportunity for the Judiciary \nCommittee to make corrections. This amendment is on the floor as a rule \nXIV.\n  I am very disappointed the Senator will not allow me to make a \nmodification. For the record, let me simply state that I was proposing \na minor change designed to further clarify what I believe to be the \nclear intent and application of our amendment. The bottom line is this: \nEven without the technical changes, our amendment is clear. We include \nthe same structure, the same crimes, and the exact same penalties as \nthe DeWine bill.\n  The only real difference between our amendment and the DeWine bill is \nthat we do not attempt to place into law language defining life as \nbeginning at conception--beginning with an embryo.\n  Just to clarify for the purpose of giving judges more legislative \nhistory with which to interpret our amendment, let me be clear about \nthe two provisions at issue.\n  The first modification concerns section (c)(2) of our amendment which \nreads ``For medical treatment of the woman or matters relating to the \npregnancy.'' This language simply tracks the DeWine language and the \nHouse bill language. I believe it is quite clear what we meant by this \nwas to exempt medical treatment of the woman or any other medical \ntreatment related to the pregnancy.\n  The second criticism or modification was that section (c)(2) which \napplies to intentional crimes against the pregnant woman is awkwardly \nworded and thus vague. The intent of the section is also clear. Our \namendment and the House and the DeWine bill would punish an individual \nwho intentionally ends a pregnancy in accordance with the murder, \nmanslaughter, or intent statutes already on the books. The level of \npenalty would be determined by a judge and would be based on the level \nof intent. For instance, punishment under the murder statute would \nrequire malice. Punishment under the manslaughter statute would not. \nBut either way the intent is clear.\n  I believe the only real reason to raise these issues is to try to \ndefeat our amendment without addressing the underlying fact that our \namendment contains the same law enforcement goals as the DeWine and the \nHouse bill, but without injecting a debate over a woman's right to \nchoose into the equation.\n  This issue is not as simple as it seems at first glance. Everyone in \nthe Senate wants to accomplish the same goal--punishing those who, by \nattacking or killing a pregnant woman, deprive families not only of the \nmother but also of the joy to help raise the child yet to be born. \nPunishing those who end a pregnancy and thus end the potential life \nexperience, all of the hopes and dreams embodied by that pregnancy and \nthe child to come, is an important advance in Federal criminal law.\n  But here is where it gets more complicated. The House bill before us, \nthe DeWine bill, now takes the position in law that life begins at \nconception. This, then, involves this bill directly into a woman's \nright to choose--an issue that need not be raised and should not be \nraised in this debate.\n  Although the text of the amendment itself technically provides an \nexception for abortion, experts on both sides of this issue agree the \nlanguage in the bill will clearly place into Federal law a definition \nof life that will chip away at the right to choose as outlined in Roe \nv. Wade. I hope to make that crystal clear as I go on.\n  The Philadelphia Inquirer in its editorial yesterday put it \nsuccinctly by saying:\n\n       If passed and signed, as promised by President Bush, the \n     Federal law would be the first to recognize unborn children \n     at any stage of development as victims with legal rights \n     separate from those of their mothers. . . . It's so easy to \n     see how a Federal unborn victims law, coupled with unborn \n     victims laws in 29 States, will form the basis of a new legal \n     challenge to Roe v. Wade, the landmark case that gives women \n     the right to terminate certain pregnancies. If a fetus who \n     dies during a crime is a murder victim, then isn't \n     abortion murder?\n\n  That is the Philadelphia Inquirer editorial of yesterday.\n  That is why I offered this substitute amendment. I think when I am \nfinished describing the differences between our amendment and the \nunderlying legislation, it will become crystal clear that these two \nmeasures accomplish the same goal in terms of criminal justice and the \nsame goal in terms of deterrence.\n  The difference between the two measures--the only difference--is our \nsubstitute does not include a new unprecedented definition of when life \nbegins.\n  The bottom line is this: It is unnecessary to include a definition of \nwhen life begins in this legislation, and including such language \ncould, and I believe will, make it much more difficult to obtain \nconvictions in these cases.\n  The substitute amendment I offer today essentially provides that if a \nperpetrator of an attack on a woman commits certain violent Federal \ncrimes against that woman and harms or ends her pregnancy, a prosecutor \ncan charge the perpetrator with the underlying Federal crime first but \ncan also charge the perpetrator with harming or ending her pregnancy \nand effectively harming or killing another potential life.\n  How is this different from the DeWine bill? It is not different at \nall. The DeWine bill provides exactly the same provisions. A prosecutor \ncan charge two crimes--one for the underlying attack on the woman and \none for the termination of the pregnancy. The penalties in the DeWine \nbill are identical to the penalties in our amendment.\n  For instance, the DeWine bill provides that if the separate offense \nresults in the ending of the pregnancy, the penalty is identical to the \npenalty for taking an adult's life. The Feinstein substitute is the \nsame. The DeWine bill says the maximum penalty for ending a pregnancy \nis a life sentence, and the maximum penalty for harming that pregnancy \nis a 20-year sentence. The Feinstein substitute is the same.\n  Neither bill allows for the death penalty and neither bill applies to \nconduct to which the pregnant woman has consented.\n  The simple truth is this: Whichever bill passes in the end, a \nprosecutor will be given exactly the same ability to charge a \ndefendant. The crimes are the same. The penalties are the same. \nEverything will be the same except a few simple words that inject the \nabortion debate into this issue by clearly establishing in criminal law \nfor the first time in history that life begins at the moment of \nconception. I contend that if this result is incorporated in law, it \nwill be the first step in removing a woman's right to choice, \nparticularly in the early months of a pregnancy before viability.\n  As we all know, the question of when life begins is a profound and a \ndeeply divisive one. So I don't believe we should be addressing that \nissue here today--without a hearing since the year 2000, without expert \ntestimony, and without need to do so. But, more importantly than that, \nthis language unnecessarily turns a simple law into a controversial one \nand, most importantly, this language could make it more difficult for \nprosecutors to obtain a conviction for the second defense of harming or \nending a pregnancy. I will describe why later.\n  It is possible that some pro-choice jurors might refuse to convict \nsimply because the language of the law refers to an unborn ``child in \nutero''--that is a quote, ``child in utero,'' that is bill language--\nwhen the victim may have only been 1 week or even 1 day pregnant.\n  An embryo in this bill becomes a person for the purpose of Federal \ncriminal sanctions for the first time in America's history. That is the \nsignificance of this bill. This substitute allows jurors to look at \nevidence and the law and it doesn't force jurors to grapple with the \ncomplicated and controversial issue of when life begins.\n  Including language defining the beginning of life is not in any way \nnecessary to the criminal law but, rather, it is only relevant to the \nabortion debate.\n  Let me show you a statement that I believe reveals the clear intent \nof this\n\n[[Page S3127]]\n\nbill. That statement is made by Samuel Casey, executive director and \nCEO of the Christian Legal Society. This is the intent:\n\n       In as many areas as we can, we want to put on the books \n     that the embryo is a person . . . that sets the stage for a \n     jurist to acknowledge that human beings at any stage of \n     development deserve protection--even protection that would \n     trump a woman's interest in terminating a pregnancy.\n\n  This will be the first strike against all abortion in the United \nStates of America. This will draw back the veil and, I believe, makes \ncrystal clear what this legislation actually is. This is the key to \nmuch of the support for this legislation: Not just adding a new \ncriminal law on the books, but also defining life as beginning at \nconception in statute here and then in the future, wherever else and \nhowever else possible. This is a concerted effort to insert the \ndefinition of when life begins into the law wherever possible.\n  Let me give some examples of quotes that again make this very clear. \nThe intention of the antichoice community has been clearly revealed by \na Republican strategist by the name of Jeffrey Bell. Here is how he put \nit:\n\n       Parental notification rules don't really prohibit anything. \n     They don't ban the act of abortion. But a cloning ban--this \n     is saying that something should be illegal. And if taking \n     [unborn] human life became illegal, that would be a \n     breakthrough. Since Roe, no one has been able to do that.\n\n  So this, Members of the Senate, is clearly the agenda, freezing the \nlaw, any law, in this case criminal law, that life begins at \nconception. Then, once declared legally, that law becomes the stepping-\nstone to refuse embryonic stem cell research and to ban abortion. Once \nthe law defines human life as beginning at conception, stem cell \nresearch could become murder, abortion becomes murder, even in the \nfirst days of a pregnancy.\n  That is where this is going. Please see it. Understand it. Know it. \nEveryone in this body who believes embryonic stem cell research holds a \npromise for cures to Parkinson's, for cures to Alzheimer's, for cures \nto juvenile diabetes, for perhaps spinal cord rupture repair, will have \nto contend with a statute that has said life begins at conception. So \nembryonic stem cell research may become murder and abortion in the \nfirst trimester becomes murder. That is where this debate is taking us. \nThat is the reason for this bill.\n  The supporters of this bill will say they do not want to undermine \nRoe, but that is precisely what Nebraska State senator Mike Foley said \nwhen he proposed legislation to allow wrongful death suits involving \nthe termination of a pregnancy. Let me quote him. Let me pull back the \nveil again:\n\n       We said specifically in our bill that we did not want to \n     challenge Roe v. Wade, and that would not affect abortion in \n     the legal sense. But philosophically, sure, these laws are a \n     challenge . . . If a state can put someone in jail for life \n     because they took the life of an unborn child, then we're \n     clearly saying there is something very valuable there.\n\n  Why is he saying that? He is saying that because a fetus, even at \nconception, becomes a person, becomes a human being.\n  Professor R. Alta Charo of the University of Wisconsin further points \nout how these efforts are aimed at changing the law and how the Supreme \nCourt might rule in future abortion cases. Charo said recently:\n\n       If you can get enough of these bricks in place, draw enough \n     examples from different parts of life and law where embryos \n     are treated as babies, then how can the Supreme Court say \n     they're not? This is, without question, conscious strategy.\n\n  This is a professor of law at the University of Wisconsin, pulling \nthe veil back further and exposing this exactly for what it is, a \n``conscious strategy'' to say life begins at conception and enshrine it \nin this Federal law, and then other laws, and then other laws, and then \ngo to the Supreme Court and Roe vs. Wade is struck down.\n  In a CNN interview last May, the distinguished chairman of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee--and I have had the pleasure of serving on that \ncommittee for 12 years--made the following comment:\n\n       They say it undermines abortion rights. It does undermine \n     it. But that's irrelevant. We're concerned here about a woman \n     and her child . . . The partisan arguments over abortion \n     should not stop at a bill that protects women and children.\n\n  If that is true, then the Senator from Utah should vote for our \namendment because our amendment does exactly the same thing, the same \npenalties for the same crimes as the House bill.\n  When Justice Harry Blackmun wrote in 1973 the Roe decision, he said:\n\n     . . . the unborn have never been recognized in law as persons \n     in the whole sense . . .\n\n  Let me repeat that: ``the unborn have never been recognized in the \nlaw as persons in the whole sense.''\n  What he did by saying that was actually, inadvertently provide a \nroadmap for the anti-choice people and those who want to undermine Roe \nand eventually to reverse it. This bill, the underlying bill, is \nfollowing that roadmap by changing a criminal law in a way which \nclearly says an embryo can be an individual as a person for the \npurposes of criminal prosecution.\n  Clearly, this is a concerted effort to codify in law the legal \nrecognition life begins at conception. If we allow that to happen today \nin this bill or in any bill, we put the right to choose squarely at \nrisk. Roe v. Wade allowed States to claim a legitimate interest in \npreventing abortion postviability. Many states--and we both know that--\nhave laws on the books with respect to the third trimester and even the \nsecond trimester.\n  If the concept of viability, which means when a fetus can live \noutside of the womb, gives way to a definition that provides life \nbegins at conception, we could soon see abortion in this country \noutlawed entirely. Our amendment avoids that problem and focuses only \non the need to increase penalties for those who attack pregnant women.\n  There has been a lot of discussion about the tragic Laci Peterson \ncase in my State of California. I have had the pleasure of meeting with \nLaci's mother, Sharon Rocha, a very fine woman and a woman who I can \nunderstand is decimated by what happened to her daughter. Some in the \nSenate have suggested that this tragedy is evidence of a loophole in \nFederal law that needs to be closed.\n  However, the House bill and the DeWine bill will have no impact in \nany way, shape, or form on the Laci Peterson case. The perpetrator of \nthat crime will be prosecuted and punished under current California law \nand the perpetrators of almost all similar crimes through the country \nwill, in fact, be prosecuted under State laws, not a Federal law, \nunless the crime takes place on Federal property.\n  In my State of California, the legislature amended California's \nexisting murder statute in 1970--that is 34 years ago--to read as \nfollows:\n\n       Murder is the unlawful killing of a human being, or a \n     fetus, with malice aforethought.\n\n  Now, if this were the case, if this were written in Federal law, \neasy, I would support it in a minute because it draws a distinction, it \npermits the ``double charge'' that both Senator DeWine and I agree is \nnecessary. But the use of the words ``or fetus'' makes a distinction \nbetween a human being and a fetus for purposes of the application of \nthe homicide statute. That is important. And that is the law under \nwhich Laci Peterson's alleged murderer is going to be prosecuted.\n  If you look at it, you will see it is completely adequate. The \ncomplexity of that case, which continues today, is one that relates to \nevidence and proof, not a problem with statutes or penalties. The \nCalifornia statute is wholly adequate. So the bill we discuss today \nwould have absolutely no impact on the Laci Peterson case, none.\n  Now, I would like to bring to the Senate's attention a July 10 letter \nfrom a Stanford law professor. He goes into the problems of what this \nlaw, if passed, could actually do in the courtroom to actual \nprosecutions and to juries. His name is George Fisher. He is a criminal \nlaw expert. He is a former prosecutor. He served as an assistant DA, an \nassistant attorney general. He has taught criminal law at Stanford Law \nSchool since 1995, and he has founded Stanford's criminal prosecution \nunit.\n  He makes three points. Let me quote him:\n\n       The Bill's apparent purpose of influencing the course of \n     abortion politics will discourage prosecutions under any \n     future Act. I do not know what motives gave rise to the \n     Bill's use of the expressions ``child in utero'' and ``child, \n     who is in utero,'' but I do know that any vaguely savvy \n     reader will conclude that these terms and the Bill's \n     definition of\n\n[[Page S3128]]\n\n     them were intended by the Bill's authors to influence the \n     course of abortion politics.\n       If the authors of the Bill truly seek to protect unborn \n     life from criminal violence, they will better accomplish this \n     purpose by avoiding such expressions as ``child in utero.'' \n     Better alternatives would refer to injury or death to a fetus \n     or damage to or termination of a pregnancy.\n\n  Dr. Fisher goes on to say:\n\n       The Bill's apparent purpose of influencing the course of \n     abortion politics will motivate prosecutors to exclude those \n     prospective jurors who otherwise would be most sympathetic to \n     the prosecution's case.\n       I predict that many or most judges will bar prosecutors and \n     defense counsel from questioning prospective jurors about \n     their views on abortion or about related matters such as \n     their religion, religious practices, or political \n     affiliations. Forced to act largely on instinct, prosecutors \n     may be inclined to exercise peremptory challenges against \n     those prospective jurors who appear to be most sympathetic to \n     the rights of pregnant women. This result clearly would \n     frustrate the Bill's stated purpose of protecting unborn life \n     from criminal violence.\n\n  He concludes:\n\n       The Bill's apparent purpose of influencing the course of \n     abortion politics offends the integrity of the criminal law. \n     To anyone who cares deeply about the integrity of the \n     criminal law, this Bill's apparent attempt to insert an \n     abortion broadside into the criminal code is greatly \n     offensive.\n\n  Now, that is a former prosecutor, a former assistant DA, assistant \nAG, a professor of law at Stanford Law School--one of the great law \nschools of our country--and head of the criminal prosecution unit at \nStanford Law School.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the entire letter printed in the \nRecord following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, the substitute amendment, which I have \noffered, has been crafted to avoid these problems.\n  Our amendment, the Motherhood Protection Act, will accomplish the \nsame goal as the Unborn Victims of Violence Act, but will do so in a \nway that does not involve us in the debate about abortion or when life \nbegins. In my view, there is no reason to vote against this substitute \nunless the intention is to establish legally that human life, for the \npurposes of Federal criminal law, begins at the moment of conception \nbecause, ladies and gentlemen, that is exactly what this bill does.\n  To emphasize the point, let me again turn to the comments of Samuel \nCasey, executive director and CEO of the Christian Legal Society, who \nclearly states the intention behind the bill in this quote:\n\n       In as many areas as we can, we want to put on the books \n     that the embryo is a person. . . .That sets the stage for a \n     jurist to acknowledge that human beings at any stage of \n     development deserve protection--even protection that would \n     trump a woman's interest in terminating a pregnancy.\n\n  Let there be no doubt about the intent. Anyone who is pro-choice \ncannot vote for this bill without the expectation that they are \ncreating the first legal bridge to destroy Roe v. Wade.\n  Now, there is a time and a place to discuss the morality and \nphilosophy of when life begins. This is not that time. Now is the time \nto change our Federal law to punish criminals who would inflict \ngrievous injuries or death upon pregnant women on Federal lands. So I \nurge my colleagues to support the substitute amendment.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                          Stanford Law School,\n\n                                      Stanford, CA, July 10, 2003.\n     Senator Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Hart Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: I wish to express my concern about \n     the current formulation of S. 1019, the Unborn Victims of \n     Violence Act of 2003. Although I fully endorse the Bill's \n     ultimate aim of protecting pregnant women from the physical \n     and psychological trauma of an endangered or lost pregnancy, \n     I believe that the Bill's current formulation will frustrate \n     rather than forward this goal.\n       I write both as a former prosecutor and as a law professor \n     specializing in criminal law and criminal prosecution. At the \n     outset of my career, I served as an assistant district \n     attorney in Middlesex County, Mass., and as an assistant \n     attorney general in the Massachusetts Attorney General's \n     office. I then went to Boston College Law School, where I \n     administered and taught in the criminal prosecution clinic. I \n     have been at Stanford since 1995 and a tenured professor of \n     law since 1999; during the next academic year, I will serve \n     as Academic Associate Dean. In 1996 I founded Stanford's \n     criminal prosecution clinic and have administered and taught \n     in the clinic ever since. I have also created a course in \n     prosecutorial ethics, which I taught at Boston College Law \n     School and, as a visitor, at Harvard Law School.\n       My background and interest in criminal prosecution prompt \n     me to raise three objections to this Bill. All of them focus \n     on the Bill's use of the expressions ``child in utero'' and \n     ``child, who is in utero,'' and on its definition of these \n     terms as ``a member of the species homo sapiens, at any stage \n     of development, who is carried in the womb.''\n       First: The Bill's apparent purpose of influencing the \n     course of abortion politics will discourage prosecutions \n     under any future Act.\n       I do not know what motives gave rise to the Bill's use of \n     the expressions ``child in utero'' and ``child, who is in \n     utero,'' but I do know that any vaguely savvy reader will \n     conclude that these terms and the Bill's definition of \n     them were intended by the Bill's authors to influence the \n     course of abortion politics. It is a fair prediction that \n     when a pro-life President is in office, prosecutions under \n     this Bill will be more frequent than when a pro-choice \n     President is in office. That is because the public will \n     interpret this Bill as suggesting that abortion is a \n     potentially criminal act and will interpret prosecutions \n     under the Bill as endorsing this sentiment.\n       If the authors of the Bill truly seek to protect unborn \n     life from criminal violence, they will better accomplish this \n     purpose by avoiding such expressions as ``child in utero.'' \n     Better alternatives would refer to injury or death to a fetus \n     or damage to or termination of a pregnancy.\n       Second: The Bill's apparent purpose of influencing the \n     course of abortion politics will motivate prosecutors to \n     exclude those prospective jurors who otherwise would be most \n     sympathetic to the prosecution's case.\n       If I were prosecuting a case under this Bill, I would hope \n     to have a jury that includes persons deeply sensitive to the \n     rights and interests of pregnant women. Such jurors would \n     regard an attack on a pregnant woman as being a twofold \n     crime, comprising both the injury directly inflicted on the \n     mother and the stark emotional and physical trauma resulting \n     from injury to or loss of her pregnancy.\n       But such jurors also will be more likely than others to \n     believe that pregnant women have the right to exercise \n     autonomy over their bodies and to choose whether to abort a \n     pregnancy. I predict that many or most judges will bar \n     prosecutors and defense counsel from questioning prospective \n     jurors about their views on abortion or about related matters \n     such as their religion, religious practices, or political \n     affiliations. Forced to act largely on instinct, prosecutors \n     may be inclined to exercise peremptory challenges against \n     those prospective jurors who appear to be most sympathetic to \n     the rights of pregnant women. This result clearly would \n     frustrate the Bill's stated purpose of protecting unborn life \n     from criminal violence.\n       Third: The Bill's apparent purpose of influencing the \n     course of abortion politics offends the integrity of the \n     criminal law.\n       To anyone who cares deeply about the integrity of the \n     criminal law, this Bill's apparent attempt to insert an \n     abortion broadside into the criminal code is greatly \n     offensive. The power to inflict criminal penalties is, second \n     only to the power to wage war, the highest trust invested in \n     our institutions of government. Because the power to make and \n     enforce criminal laws inherently carries enormous potential \n     for abuse, those who exercise that power must always do so \n     with a spirit free of any ulterior political motive. The \n     American Bar Association's Standards Relating to the \n     Administration of Criminal Justice provide that ``[i]n making \n     the decision to prosecute, the prosecutor should give no \n     weight to the personal or political advantages or \n     disadvantages which might be involved . . . .'' (Standard \n     3-3.9(d).) Not all prosecutors conduct themselves with \n     fidelity to this principle, but we may readily condemn \n     those who do not. We may likewise condemn other public \n     actors who abuse the sacred public trust of the criminal \n     sanction for political ends.\n       For these reasons, I object to the current formulation of \n     the Unborn Victims of Violence Bill. As I am confident that \n     an alternative version of the Bill can fully accomplish its \n     stated purpose of protecting unborn life from criminal \n     violence while avoiding each of the difficulties I have \n     outlined above, I strongly encourage the Senate to modify the \n     Bill in the ways I have suggested above or in some other \n     manner that avoids the freighted and frankly politicized \n     terms, ``child in utero'' and ``child, who is in utero.''\n       My thanks to you for your consideration of my views.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    George Fisher,\n                                                 Professor of Law.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, how much time have I consumed?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 89 minutes left.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I have 89 minutes remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair.\n  I know the Senator from New Jersey is on the floor wishing time.\n  Mr. DeWINE. He can take it now.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Good. May I ask the Senator how much time he would \nlike?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I would like to have about 10 minutes.\n\n[[Page S3129]]\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nNew Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from California \nand also our distinguished colleague from Ohio.\n  I rise to express my strong opposition to the underlying bill and \nsupport for the amendment by the Senator from California.\n  I have long supported legislation that combats domestic violence. I \nwas the author of the domestic violence gun ban because abusers should \nnot have access to weapons, to guns. Whether an abuser is terrorizing \nhis wife or his children, let's take away their means to inflict \nfurther terror and abuse. So far, my law has prevented nearly 30,000 \nabusers from obtaining guns.\n  Because of my long-term commitment to stopping violence against women \nand children, I take offense at the fact that the backers of this bill \nare exploiting this issue in order to advance another anti-choice \nagenda.\n  We see this regularly around this place. I saw it in a commerce \nsubcommittee meeting that was supposed to discuss science, space, and \ntechnology. The witnesses who were at the table were there to talk \nabout their opposition to abortion and their experience after they \nthemselves had abortions. They made their decisions after an action \nthat they took that placed them in that position. Now they wanted to \nblock everybody else from having a chance to make their personal \nchoices.\n\n  We have to understand what underlies this issue. Yes, it is \nworthwhile to protect people and those who are not yet born against \nviolence, but to make it a crime of this magnitude, when there is so \nmuch else at stake in the matter of choice, decided many years ago by \nthe Supreme Court--supporters of this bill will tell you this \nlegislation protects women, protects children, and this is a bill about \npunishing crime. But if you want to know what this bill is really \nabout, you only need listen to what a leading supporter of this bill \ntold CNN when asked about the legislation. I quote him:\n\n       They say it undermines abortion rights. It does . . . But \n     that's irrelevant.\n\n  That is the prevailing attitude of those who want to impose yet \nanother restriction on a woman's choice, on the protection of a woman's \nhealth. This bill is intended, plainly and simply, to undermine Roe v. \nWade. But rather than being direct about the goal, anti-choice \nadvocates want to use tragedies like violence against women as a red \nherring to move their agenda.\n  Over and over, we see this body taking up legislation that I believe \nis part of an attempt to establish what I call a ``male-ogarchy'' in \nour society. A male-ogarchy is a society in which men are making \ndecisions for and about women. Anti-choice advocates simply don't trust \nwomen and their doctors to know what is best for their bodies and their \nlives. We even encountered this male-ogarchy last year when this body \ntold doctors and their patients that it is Congress, rather than the \nmedical experts, who know best about their health. And when the so-\ncalled partial-birth abortion bill was signed, there were all men on \nthe stage with the President of the United States, smiling and gloating \nas they took away the right of a woman, in consultation with her doctor \nand her conscience, to make a decision that, though painful, is \nappropriate for her well-being.\n  Do we want to decide here whether or not a woman has a right to make \na decision about her choice for an abortion? Perhaps she has two, \nthree, four other children at home and her health is in jeopardy. We \nare saying: It doesn't matter what you think, Madam. We are going to \nmake the decision for you.\n  That is why there wasn't one woman standing with the President at the \nWhite House the day that so-called partial-birth abortion prohibition \npassed the Senate, when the President signed the bill.\n  President Bush and his supporters in the Senate say they care about \ndomestic violence and protecting women. But if that is the case, how, \nthen, do we explain the fact that the President's budget cuts funding \nfor the Violence Against Women Act programs by $116 million next year? \nIs that going to help women? Is that going to make life better for \nthem? No. It is going to make life worse. Those are living people. \nThose are people who were here. Those are people for whom this male \ngroup wants to decide, make decisions.\n  If Congress wants to get serious about violence against women and \nchildren, let's do something real about it. Let's fund programs that \nprovide money to law enforcement to prevent domestic violence and \nsexual assault. Let's fund battered women's programs and rape crisis \ncenters instead of cutting funding for these often lifesaving services. \nLet's improve access to shelters, making it easier for abused women and \ntheir children to flee that abuse.\n\n  If this so-called Unborn Victims of Violence Act were actually about \nviolent crime, then the domestic violence community would be in support \nof it. But they oppose the bill. The National Network to End Domestic \nViolence, the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, and the \nFamily Violence Prevention Fund, all oppose this legislation.\n  Many backers of this bill also support giving a $1 trillion tax break \nto the wealthiest among us, rather than giving it to the struggling \nworking families who need it to help pay for everyday goods and \nservices, programs such as Head Start for children who don't have a \ncomfortable home life that permits them to engage in the process of \nlearning or of expecting to learn, who often get their only nutritional \nmeal from the program. Three hundred thousand of those children are \ndenied access to these programs because we have taken away the funding \nto give tax breaks to those who have been fortunate enough to live in \nthis country, to make a lot of money, to succeed.\n  I am one of those. I had a good business career, as did many here. We \ndon't need this kind of thing. We don't want it. We want our country to \nbe strong. We want the strength to be built in a harmonious society and \nto lend a hand to those who don't have the ability to help themselves. \nBut now that can't happen. We are focused on giving tax breaks to the \nwealthy and making them permanent, as we dig ourselves deeper into \ndebt.\n  Many of my colleagues who support this bill also reject expending \nhealth insurance coverage for poor and lower middle-class children and \ntheir families. Many who support this bill will tell you they want to \nsimply protect children. I find it ironic that they only want to \nprotect children before they are born, but they don't want to do what \nthey have to after they are born. I see it as hypocrisy.\n  I challenge supporters of this bill to get serious about protecting \nwomen and children and pass meaningful legislation that improves the \nlives of these women and children, not this undercover move to restrict \nchoice for women.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I have a great deal of respect for my \ncolleagues from New Jersey and California. My colleague from New Jersey \nknows I care about what happens after children are born. I care about \ntheir health. I believe I have demonstrated that in the Senate. In \nfact, he and I have worked on these issues together. I have worked with \nmy colleague from California on many issues having to do with children. \nWe just happen to disagree on this issue.\n  I have a great deal of respect for both of them. We have worked \ntogether on a bipartisan basis on a wide range of issues. I would hope \nthat as we debate this bill, we would focus on the legislation. I say \nthat with all due respect. I don't understand--again, with all due \nrespect to my colleagues--what debate about the motives of people has \nto do with what the facts are.\n  I am going to try to confine my debate to what I think are the \nessential facts. I think they are fairly simple. Let me talk for a few \nmoments about what I believe are the essential facts.\n  I ask my colleagues who are listening to this debate to remember a \ncouple of things about the Feinstein amendment. I am going to keep \ncoming back to these central facts about the Feinstein amendment.\n\n[[Page S3130]]\n\n  No. 1, the Feinstein amendment does not recognize a second victim. \nOur bill does. The Feinstein amendment creates a legal fiction. It is \ncontorted, it twists the law in a sense--maybe a better way of saying \nit is not that it twists the law; it doesn't do that, but it twists the \nreality of the common sense of people when they look at this. When they \nsee a pregnant woman who is assaulted and her child dies, they \nintuitively know there is a victim besides the mother. They know the \nmother is a victim, but they also know there is a second victim.\n  The vast majority of the American people, if you ask them was there \nanother victim, will say of course there are two victims. Our bill \nrecognizes the second victim. The Feinstein amendment refuses to \nrecognize the second victim. Now we can talk about punishment and all \nkinds of things, but it refuses to recognize good common sense.\n  This bill in front of us has nothing to do with abortion. It has \nabsolutely nothing to do with abortion. We have explicitly exempted \nabortion in this bill. Yet opponents still try to argue this point.\n  Our statute could be no more clear on this point. Senator Feinstein \nuses identical language to exempt abortion or any related activity in \nher amendment. This bill simply doesn't affect abortion rights \nwhatsoever. The language could not be clearer. I invite my colleagues \nto pick up the bill and look at the section. It exempts any reference \nto abortion, anything a mother would do to her own child, anything a \ndoctor would do is exempted. It has nothing to do with abortion, not at \nall. That is not what this is about.\n  Point No. 1, this bill recognizes a second victim; the Feinstein \namendment does not. If you believe there is a second victim, you cannot \nvote for the Feinstein amendment. It denies there is a second victim.\n  The second point I want to make will come as a surprise, I think, to \nthe Members of the Senate. It will come as a surprise to you until you \npick up the Feinstein amendment and read it carefully. I invite you to \ndo that. Pick up the amendment and read it carefully.\n  First, the Feinstein amendment does not punish the criminal for \nharming or injuring the baby. Let me read it. It only punishes the \ncriminal for ``interrupting or terminating a pregnancy.'' That is the \nlanguage, ``interrupting or terminating a pregnancy.'' But not for \ninjuring. So if a child is injured, not killed, the pregnancy not \nterminated, the Feinstein amendment will not cover it. That, to me, is \na problem. That is a fatal fallacy, fatal problem.\n  Here is the language:\n\n       Any person who engages in conduct that violates any of the \n     provisions of law listed in subsection (b) and thereby causes \n     the termination of a pregnancy or the interruption of the \n     normal course of pregnancy, including termination of the \n     pregnancy other than by live birth is guilty of a separate \n     offense under this section.\n\n  It does not cover the injury of a fetus. That is a problem.\n  Let's turn to the penalty section. The penalty section is fatally \nflawed. The penalty section won't work. The Justice Department has sent \na letter and, in their opinion, the penalty section provides no \npenalty, under the Feinstein amendment, for the killing of the fetus. \nIt is vague; it is unclear at best. It defines additional crimes as the \ninterruption or termination of a pregnancy. When it describes the \npunishment, it refers to injury or death. Whose injury or death are we \ntalking about here? Is it the unborn child? Whose injury?\n\n  The Feinstein amendment doesn't recognize that the interruption and \ntermination of the pregnancy means the injury or death of the fetus \nbecause it won't acknowledge the fetus, of course, as a separate being.\n  The amendment is circular and really without meaning. Put simply, \nthere is no additional punishment because under this amendment there is \nno additional victim. The Feinstein amendment goes out of its way not \nto recognize another victim. What is the reference to? Let me read this \nsection and, again, this is a technical reading, but that is how you \nhave to read a criminal section. This is how judges have to do it. The \nbottom line is--I am going to say it again and again--if you vote for \nFeinstein, there will be no penalty at all for the killing of a second \nvictim, the child. There clearly is none for the injury of that child. \nLet me read the penalty section, 2(a), under the Feinstein amendment:\n\n       Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, the \n     punishment for that separate offense is the same as the \n     punishment provided for that conduct under Federal law had \n     that injury or death occurred to the pregnant woman.\n\n  What injury or death are we talking about? To whom?\n  The language doesn't acknowledge injury or death to the fetus. Who is \nit referencing in the previous paragraph? It clearly is fatally flawed. \nIt is difficult for me to read this and for people to understand it. \nBut to get the section out, it clearly doesn't work and is fatally \nflawed. So this does not recognize the death, does not recognize any \npunishment. It would not provide punishment and it clearly presents a \nproblem.\n  My friend from California has said the DeWine bill would have no \neffect on the Laci Peterson case. That is true; it would not. \nFortunately, California has a similar law that provides for a second \nvictim, the punishment for the death of that child. While it is true \nthe DeWine bill would have no effect on the Laci Peterson case, the \nfact is if the Feinstein amendment, or a similar amendment to the \nFeinstein amendment, had been approved by the California legislature at \nthe time their law was being considered, there would be no punishment \nfor the death of baby Conner Peterson. There would have been in \nCalifornia no recognition for that second victim. There would have been \nno recognition of the death of that second victim.\n  If the Feinstein amendment would have passed, or a version of it, in \nCalifornia, if the California legislature would have done what Senator \nFeinstein is asking us to do today in this Federal legislation, they \nwould not have been able to prosecute for the death of Conner \nPeterson. They would not have been able to recognize that death as a \nsecond victim death. That is the fundamental fact, and that is the \nfundamental difference between the DeWine bill and the Feinstein \namendment.\n\n  We have heard a lot of talk about motives and agendas. I think we \nshould stop doing that, and I think we should look to the victims and \nhear from the victims. There are three victims. The families of the \nvictims were here yesterday. When one talks with the victims, it is \nclear the victims believe there are two victims. Let me talk about \nseveral cases. They are tragic cases and are difficult to listen to, \nbut I think it brings home what we are really talking about.\n  Let me talk about the example of Airman Gregory Robbins. This is a \ncase about which I have talked many times on the Senate floor, but I \nthink is worth repeating today because it illustrates the injustice \nthat exists today in our Federal law.\n  In 1996, Airman Robbins and his family were stationed in my home \nState of Ohio at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton. At that \ntime, Mrs. Robbins was more than 8 months pregnant with their daughter \nthey named Jasmine. On September 12, 1996, in a fit of rage, Airman \nRobbins wrapped his fist in a T-shirt and savagely beat his wife by \nstriking her repeatedly about the head and stomach. Fortunately, Mrs. \nRobbins survived this violent assault, but tragically, her uterus \nruptured during the attack, expelling the baby into her abdominal \ncavity, causing Jasmine's death.\n  Does anyone truly think Jasmine was not a victim? I think we know she \nwas. Not only was her mom a victim, but she was as well.\n  Let me give another example. In August 1999, Shiwona Pace of Little \nRock, AR, was days away from giving birth. She was understandably \nthrilled about her pregnancy. Her boyfriend, Eric Bullock, however, did \nnot share her joy and enthusiasm. In fact, Eric wanted the baby to die. \nSo he hired three thugs to beat his girlfriend so badly that she lost \nthe unborn baby whom she named Heaven. I might add, she lost that baby \n1 day shy of her predicted delivery date. Shiwona testified at a Senate \njudiciary hearing we held in Washington on February 23, 2000. This is \nwhat she said:\n\n       I begged and pleaded for the life of my unborn child, but \n     they showed me no mercy. In fact, one of them told me, ``Your \n     baby is dying tonight.'' I was choked, hit in the face with a \n     gun, slapped, punched, and kicked repeatedly in the stomach. \n     One of them even put a gun in my mouth and threatened to \n     shoot.\n\n  Do we really believe Shiwona was the only victim here? Do we really \nthink\n\n[[Page S3131]]\n\nwe should adopt an amendment that says she was the only victim? I don't \nthink so. How can we suggest to Shiwona that her child was not \nmurdered? Should we twist the law so we don't recognize that? I don't \nthink we should. And Federal law, quite frankly, must recognize this \nwrong for what it is. It is a wrong against two separate and distinct \nvictims.\n  Another example: I can think of no better way to tell the story of \nBaby Zachariah and his mother Tracy Marciniak than by simply reading \nfrom her testimony before the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the \nConstitution which occurred on July 8, 2003. Let me read it:\n\n       I carried Zachariah in my womb for almost nine full months. \n     He was killed in my womb, only 5 days from his delivery \n     date. The first time I ever held him in my arms, he was \n     already dead.\n       There is no way that I can really tell you about the pain I \n     feel when I visit my son's grave site in Milwaukee, and at \n     other times, thinking of all that we missed together. But \n     that pain was greater because the man who killed Zachariah \n     got away with murder.\n       Zachariah's delivery date was to be February 13, 1992. But \n     on the night of February 8, my own husband brutally attacked \n     me at my home in Milwaukee. He held me against a couch by my \n     hair. He knew that I very much wanted my son. He punched me \n     very hard twice in the abdomen. Then he refused to call for \n     help, and prevented me from calling.\n       After about 15 minutes of my screaming in pain that I \n     needed help, he finally went to a bar and from there called \n     for help. Zachariah and I were rushed by ambulance to the \n     hospital, where Zachariah was delivered by emergency \n     Caesarean section. My son was dead. The physicians said he \n     had bled to death inside me because of blunt force trauma.\n       My own injuries were life-threatening. I nearly died. I \n     spent 3 weeks in the hospital. During the time I was \n     struggling to survive, the legal authorities came and they \n     spoke to my sister. They told her something that she found \n     incredible. They told her that in the eyes of Wisconsin law, \n     nobody had died on the night of February 8. Later, this \n     information was passed on to me. I was told in the eyes of \n     the law, no murder had occurred. I was devastated.\n       We surviving family members of unborn victims of violence \n     are not asking for revenge. We are begging for justice--\n     justice like we were brought up to believe in and trust in. \n     Justice means that the penalty must fit the crime, but that \n     is only part of it--justice also requires that the law must \n     recognize the true nature of a crime.\n\n  The true nature of a crime, Mr. President.\n\n       I know that some lawmakers and some groups insist there is \n     no such thing as an unborn victim, and that crimes like this \n     only have a single victim--but that is callous and that is \n     wrong. Please don't tell me that my son was not a real victim \n     of a real crime. We were both victims, but only I survived.\n\n  I will have more to say about this in a few minutes. At this point, I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, may I briefly suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I wish to respond to some of the concerns and \ncomplaints of the distinguished Senator from Ohio about our substitute \namendment. Let me take on his allegation that this substitute does not \nprovide a punishment for harming a child. In fact, it does. It clearly \nstates that the interruption of the normal course of the pregnancy \nrelates to injury to the fetus. So there is a penalty for harm.\n  Secondly, he stated my amendment would not provide any penalty for \nending a pregnancy; that it was a legal fiction in that sense.\n  I think this is clearly a misunderstanding of the plain text of our \namendment. We explicitly create a separate offense for interrupting or \nending a pregnancy, and we explicitly state the penalty for that \noffense is the same as if the crime had resulted in the injury or death \nof a mother. That is explicit.\n  So the intent is clear. I think quibbling about whether the language \nis perfect, the amendment does exactly what the underlying bill does. I \ncould have cleared that up with a modification, but the Senator would \nnot let me send a modification to the desk, which in terms of just \nsheer congeniality is rather surprising because that could have been \nmade crystal clear to everyone.\n  So I firmly believe our amendment does exactly the same thing as the \nDeWine amendment, but it does not do something his amendment does, and \nthat is create life at the point of conception. His use of the words \n``child in utero'' as opposed to the California statute's use of the \nwords ``or fetus'' make a huge difference in the law legally. Once \nagain, I think that is clear.\n  The bottom line is we believe the intent and the crafting of this \nbill is very clear. We do not create a child in utero. We try to avoid \ngetting to the point where life is defined.\n  We say that if the pregnancy is intentionally terminated and specific \ndamages are done to the fetus, it is punished either through \nmanslaughter in a second charge or murder in a second charge. I think \nthe language is very clear. I think it is nitpicking to say it is not.\n  I can change it, but I am not allowed to change it. We have the \nmodification, but we are not allowed to send the modification to the \ndesk. I believe Members can vote on this amendment and know clearly \nthey are assessing the same penalties for the same crimes as the \nunderlying bill does. The only difference is we do not decide in our \nbill when life begins.\n  Let me read a couple of editorials and statements that have come out \nin recent days. There is one editorial this morning in the Los Angeles \nTimes. I would like just quickly to read one paragraph:\n\n       The Senate is likely to vote today on a bill intended \n     largely to score points in the endless, wearying abortion \n     debate. The proposed Unborn Victims of Violence Act defines a \n     child in utero as a member of the species homo sapiens, at \n     any stage of development, who is carried in the womb. In \n     other words, the child exists at the moment of conception. \n     The House passed similar legislation last month. As with \n     nearly every aspect of the abortion debate, Americans are \n     deeply divided over when human life begins. However courts in \n     most States generally accord more rights to a fetus \n     considered viable outside the womb. DeWine's bill, S. 1019, \n     offers a sweeping declaration that ignores prevailing \n     scientific views and the national legal consensus. True, his \n     bill specifically bars prosecution for abortion, but its \n     effect, as DeWine intends, would be to give one side a new \n     legal bullet in the broader abortion wars.\n\n  That is clear. I will go on. The Los Angeles Times is not the only \neditorial page that believes that. I indicated earlier this is true of \nan editorial in the Philadelphia Inquirer:\n\n       It is so easy to see how a federal unborn victims law, \n     coupled with unborn victims' laws in 29 States, will form the \n     basis of a new legal challenge to Roe v. Wade, a landmark \n     case that gives women the right to terminate certain \n     pregnancies. If a fetus who dies during a crime is a murder \n     victim, why, then, isn't abortion murder?\n\n  From the Buffalo News:\n\n       Passage by House Republicans of a bill that treats an \n     attack on a pregnant woman as separate crimes against her and \n     her unborn child is at heart an attempt to erode abortion \n     rights. It's a disingenuous and misguided bill and the Senate \n     should make sure it goes no further.\n\n  That is the Buffalo News.\n  The New York Times, April 25. This is 2001.\n\n       Packaged as a crime fighting measure unrelated to abortion, \n     the bill is actually aimed at fulfilling a long-time goal of \n     the right-to-life movement. The goal is to enshrine in law \n     the concept of fetal rights equal to but separate and \n     distinct from the rights of pregnant women.\n\n  Another editorial of the New York Times:\n\n       The bill would add to the Federal Criminal Code a separate \n     new offense to punish individuals who injure or cause \n     death to a child who is in utero.\n\n  The Washington Post, October 2, 1999,\n\n       What makes this bill a bad idea is the very aspect of it \n     that makes it attractive to its supporters, that it treats \n     the fetus as a person separate from the mother though that \n     same mother has a constitutional right to terminate her \n     pregnancy. This is useful rhetorically for the pro-life \n     world, but it is analytically incoherent.\n\n  The Blethen, ME, newspaper:\n\n       First considered in 1999, the bill purports to create new \n     Federal crimes for the intentional harm or death of a fetus \n     or unborn child. But, no matter how much supporters deny it, \n     the bill's real intent is to undermine women's reproductive \n     choices. If the bill is passed and signed into law, it would \n     weaken\n\n[[Page S3132]]\n\n     the prudent and pragmatic decision handed down in Roe v. \n     Wade.\n\n  In my remarks, I have tried to show that this is a concerted effort. \nIt need not be so. You can attach the same penalties for the same \ncrimes, as our substitute does, without getting into the debate of \nwhere life begins. This bill chooses to get into the debate of where \nlife begins and it defines life beginning at conception. It does so in \na Federal criminal statute. It is one step in the building blocks of \nstatutes that will constitute the ability to demolish Roe v. Wade.\n  I think every Member of this body who is pro-choice should vote \nagainst the underlying bill and for this amendment because in this \namendment, without creating the separate person at conception, we \nestablish the penalties for interruption or termination of a pregnancy. \nThose penalties are the same--same for murder, same for manslaughter, \nsame for attempted murder, same for attempted manslaughter.\n  Again, I point out that in California what the State did 34 years ago \nwas essentially amend the murder statute. By amending the definition in \nthe Penal Code section 187, they provided a new definition of murder \nwhich said:\n\n       Murder is the unlawful killing of a human being, or a fetus \n     with malice aforethought.\n\n  That is the bill under which the Laci Peterson case will be brought \nto court. It is a different idea because it clearly says that it is a \nfetus.\n  Additionally, there is information from those who wish to continue \nthis pursuit to make a fetus a human life, to make an embryo a human \nlife, that this is a concerted strategy aimed at weakening Roe v. Wade.\n  What we have tried to do is mimic the House bill with respect to the \npenalties but connect it to the termination of a pregnancy and thereby \navoid the distinction of exactly when life begins for the purposes of \nstatute law, in this case criminal statute law, and therefore avoid the \nproblem.\n  I have indicated, from legal scholars, where they believe this will \nundermine prosecutions in this situation because they will encourage \nperemptory challenges of individuals who may have strong beliefs in \nchoice and, therefore, not one likely to recognize that an embryo, or a \nday pregnancy, or a week pregnancy, or a month pregnancy is, in fact, a \nliving being subject to criminal sanctions if their rights are \nviolated.\n\n  It is a complicated issue. But it is a significant issue. It is an \nimportant issue.\n  The more I look at it and see the strategy of the anti-choice \nmovement, the more I see that if you can establish a beachhead of \nrights in Federal criminal law here, and another statute there, and in \na third statute somewhere else, you then begin the march to the Supreme \nCourt in an attack on Roe. Roe sets up a trimester system giving the \nwoman total rights in the first trimester, and then the State the right \nin the second and third trimester to intervene in certain cases, which \nhas been the case in many State laws that have been passed. You now \ngive the Supreme Court the ability to begin to say: ``It is in law that \nthe embryo has certain rights'' and, therefore, forms the bulwark of \nthe attack on Roe.\n  You also do something else insidious. I think you very much intervene \nin stem cell research. Stem cell research, and a good deal of the most \nauspicious of that research, deals with embryonic stem cells. If you \nhave a law that says an embryo or a zygote is, in fact, a human life, \nthen it is murder if you use that embryo for stem cell research, just \nas it becomes murder if that embryo is harmed or rejected in the course \nof an attack on a woman. We avoid all of that.\n  We simply say termination of a pregnancy, and termination of a \npregnancy in the course of a criminal attack creates a second charge, \nand that second charge carries with it the same penalty as the original \ncharge against the woman herself would carry.\n  That is the clear intent.\n  I regret that the Senator would not allow me to modify my amendment. \nI can never in 12 years remember any Senator being refused the right to \nmodify an amendment, but perhaps we are playing by new rules these \ndays. I know what goes around comes around in this body. I regret that.\n  But I believe on its face our substitute amendment is clear, it is \ndefinitive, it will stand the test of time, and it will prevent what we \nhope to prevent, which is the first major law which decides when life \nbegins.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, once again, I want to bring this debate \nback to its essence. I am afraid so much of the debate from the other \nside has been about motives--by quoting, with all due respect, the L.A. \nTimes about peripheral issues.\n  Our intent, if you want to go by intent, is very simple. Our intent \nis to bring about justice for the victims of crime. Our intent is to \nbring about justice for the mother and for the child--for the unborn \nchild as well as the mother. It is to conform with what the vast \nmajority of the American people believe; that is, when a pregnant woman \nis assaulted and she either loses that child or that child is injured, \nthere are, in fact, two victims. It is as simple as that.\n  On the abortion issue, let us be done with this once and for all. \nThis bill has nothing to do with abortion. The language could not be \nsimpler.\n  Let me read to the Members of the Senate and invite anybody to read \nit.\n\n       Nothing in this section shall be construed to permit the \n     prosecution of any person with conduct relating to abortion \n     for which consent of the pregnant woman or a person \n     authorized by law to act on her behalf has been obtained or \n     for which such consent is implied by law.\n       Two, of any person for medical treatment of the pregnant \n     woman or her unborn child, or of any woman with respect to \n     her unborn child.\n\n  It is very clear. My colleague argues that this language is going to \nsomehow roll back abortion rights. That is a debate for another day. It \nis not a debate for today. That language in this bill is very clear.\n  If this language was a threat to abortion rights, then the language \nin 29 other States would have been a threat. We have 29 States that \nrecognize fetal homicide law. The language in 16 of those States is \nvirtually identical to the language in this bill.\n  If the language in this bill was a problem for abortion rights, then \nit would have been a problem with these other States.\n  Also, there are some States that have had this language on the books \nfor 30 years, and it has not been a problem for abortion rights.\n  That is just a bogus issue. Let us stop talking about it, and let us \ntalk about what the issues are.\n  Let me get back to the two points that I made before. I want everyone \nto understand the Feinstein amendment. One is not in debate, and one my \ncolleague and I do debate. One I think is not in debate at all; that \nis, the Feinstein amendment does not recognize a second victim. It goes \nagainst good common sense.\n  Ask someone back in your home State, if a pregnant woman is assaulted \nand she loses her child, how many victims are there? There are two. If \nyou ask the average person in your State--whether your State is Ohio, \nCalifornia, wherever it is--the average person on the street is going \nto say: Senator, there are two victims.\n  That is all we are saying with this bill. We are trying to close a \nloophole so that if a pregnant woman who is hiking in a national park \nor is out walking in a national park or a pregnant woman on an Air \nForce Base--we are not making these stories up. This happens. Pregnant \nwomen are attacked all the time. I saw it as a county prosecutor. You \nask any county prosecutor--yes, any police officer, anybody who is a \nvictims rights advocate--how often pregnant women are attacked, a \npregnant woman who is in a national park, a pregnant woman who is on \nFederal property and is attacked. What we are simply saying is that it \nis wrong if a national park or Federal property is in a State that does \nnot have a similar law to this. It is wrong for that Federal prosecutor \nsearching in vain the Federal statutes to find a law for which he can \ncharge that person with the death of a fetus, a child--whatever word \nyou want to use. It is wrong. That happens today. We are closing that \nloophole.\n  When this law passes, that won't happen anymore. A Federal prosecutor \nwill be able to say, when law enforcement people come in and they have \nthat case where a woman has been violently attacked, she has been \ninjured but the\n\n[[Page S3133]]\n\nchild has been killed, they will be able to charge for death of that \nchild. That is the right thing to do. They will be able to file two \ncharges, recognize two victims, and recognize that reality. That is \nwhat this does.\n  Let me state the second thing about the Feinstein amendment. Look at \nthe amendment.\n  We have to go to the penalty section. This is the Feinstein \namendment.\n\n       Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, the \n     punishment for that separate offense is the same as the \n     punishment provided for that conduct under Federal law had \n     that injury or death occurred to the pregnant woman.\n\n  Remember, this is a criminal law. I go back to my days as a \nprosecutor: You have to construe a law strictly. When it is a criminal \nlaw, you construe it in favor of the defendant. You give every benefit \nof the doubt to the defendant. If this is vague, there is a problem for \nthe prosecutor. We have a problem with this one. A serious problem.\n  We have a letter from the Justice Department that says there is no \npenalty under the Feinstein amendment. Let's look at this carefully and \nsee why: ``Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, the \npunishment for that separate offense is the same as that punishment \nprovided for that conduct under Federal law had that injury or death \noccurred to the pregnant woman.''\n  What injury or death? The problem under the Feinstein amendment is it \ndoes not recognize the baby or fetus. Who are we talking about? Read \nthis section above. It talks about ``termination of a pregnancy or the \ninterruption of the normal course of pregnancy.'' It does not recognize \ntwo assaults, two injuries, two people. There is nothing for it to \nreference to. With all due respect, it is not drafted right. If we pass \nthe Feinstein amendment, with all due respect, not only are you not \nrecognizing a separate victim--which we all agree on--but, worse than \nthat, there is no penalty for killing the unborn; there is no penalty \nfor injury.\n  I have already pointed out, and we looked at the language, why there \nis no penalty at all for injury. That is clear when we look at this: \n``causes the termination of a pregnancy or the interruption of the \nnormal course of pregnancy, including termination of the pregnancy \nother than by live birth,'' et cetera.\n  Clearly, that is no reference to the injury. What word here has to do \nwith injury? Nothing. Clearly, this has nothing to do with injury. Any \nchild who is injured, not killed, would not be covered. And in the \nparagraph below, there is no penalty at all.\n  If we get by that, which we cannot, but even if you get by all of \nthat, you have the problem of the lesser included offense. We cannot \nget by that. But take one more problem, assuming you could get by that. \nThere is another reason the Feinstein amendment fails to create a \nseparate punishable offense to terminating pregnancy. All it does is \nrecognize attacks on an unborn child under the label of ``interruption \nor termination of pregnancy,'' then tacks that label on as an element \nto any one of the 68 Federal crimes specified. The result is a new \nseries of offenses identical to the previous 68, except for the \naddition of that one element.\n  For example, now a criminal could face a Federal charge of assault \nwith the result of termination of pregnancy as well as the original \ncharge of assault. This is important. But because he could be charged \nwith both does not mean he could be convicted and punished for both. \nInstead, he would be protected by a legal principle known to lawyers as \nlesser included offenses. That principle protects a defendant from \nbeing convicted in and punished for a whole series of crimes that are \nall a subset of a lesser crime.\n  We know, for example, the crime of manslaughter and murder. We know \none defendant cannot be convicted of both charges for the death of only \none victim. If someone is guilty of murder, then he or she must have \nbeen guilty of all the components of murder, including the components \nthat made him guilty of manslaughter, but that person, of course, is \nnot convicted of both. You cannot be convicted of both manslaughter and \nmurder. If a man is convicted of a felony for stealing $10,000, he is \nnot also found guilty of the misdemeanor of having stolen $500.\n\n  Of course, we can convict one criminal of the murder and manslaughter \nof two separate people because the laws of these crimes differ on one \ncritical point: They have different victims. That is the difference \nbetween our bill and Senator Feinstein's amendment. Ours does not have \nthat problem because we recognize two victims. Her amendment does not. \nTherefore, it is fatally flawed under this principle. Therein lies \nanother problem.\n  The bottom line is the Feinstein amendment is fatally flawed. It has \nno penalty section, as well as not recognizing there is a separate and \ndistinct victim.\n  The Justice Department analyzed and came to the same conclusion. \nAgain, it is a vague amendment. They come at it a little differently, \nbut here is what they say in a letter of March 24:\n\n       Additionally, by omitting any reference to the unborn child \n     but retaining language contained in H.R. 1997 as introduced, \n     the substitute appears to create an ambiguity that likely \n     leaves an offense, could one be found, without a \n     corresponding penalty. The substitute provides that \n     punishment for an offense prescribed by the legislation is \n     the same as the punishment provided under Federal law had the \n     ``injury or deaths occurred,'' to the pregnant woman.\n       In H.R. 1997, the object of the ``injury or death'' was the \n     unborn child. However, in the substitute the injury or death \n     provision has no object because the only victim under the \n     substitute is the woman herself. Because there are currently \n     no penalties in federal law for the offenses of ``termination \n     of a pregnancy,'' or ``the interruption of the normal course \n     of pregnancy,'' there would be no penalty even assuming that \n     a successful prosecution could be brought.\n\n  They have analyzed it a little differently than I did, but they come \nto the identical conclusion for the same reason. Again, it goes back to \nthis sentence in their letter, ``However, in the substitute, the injury \nor death provision has no object because the only victim under the \nsubstitute is the woman herself.''\n  That is the problem. That is what we have.\n  Members who come to the Senate and vote on this Feinstein amendment, \nwhich is the key vote, need to understand three things: One, abortion \nhas nothing to do with this debate. We have covered that in the \nlanguage of the bill. But more important is the precedent in the States \nhas already been set. States have bills like this. They have not \ninterrupted people's rights under the Supreme Court in regard to Roe v. \nWade and all the other court decisions. It has not interrupted rights \nhaving to do with abortion. It has nothing to do with abortion. That is \nNo. 1.\n  No. 2, the Feinstein amendment fails to recognize what everybody in \nthis country knows: When a woman is attacked, there are two victims.\n  And No. 3, the thing to remember is the Feinstein amendment carries \nno penalty. So we will be saying if the Feinstein amendment is passed, \nwe are turning our backs on these victims. We are turning our backs on \nthe unborn, these kids who are, in fact, injured or killed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. TALENT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, I yield to my colleague.\n  Mr. TALENT. Two or three minutes?\n  Mr. DeWINE. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. TALENT. Madam President, I very much appreciate the Senator \nyielding and also the courtesy of the Senator from South Carolina who, \nI know, was expecting to go next. For that reason, I am going to be \nvery brief.\n  I want to say a few words about what I understand us to be doing \ntoday and the importance of it. As I understand it, what we are doing \ntoday is conforming Federal law to the common understanding of people \naround the country, and certainly in the heartland where Missouri is \nand, indeed, the practice of most of the States.\n  If a man takes a woman across State lines--let's say she is his \ngirlfriend, and she has gotten pregnant, and he does not like that \nfact--and he assaults her, hits her in the stomach or something, with \nthe intention of getting rid of the baby, and his act of violence has \nthe intended effect and the baby dies, what we are saying is he has \nclaimed\n\n[[Page S3134]]\n\ntwo victims. He has hurt mom, or maybe done worse to her, and he has \nkilled the baby, which is what his intention was to do.\n  I think all of us recognize the seriousness of that kind of offense \nand acknowledge that an offense like that against a pregnant woman, and \ndirected at the baby, is more serious because of the status of \npregnancy and because of the existence of that child than it would \notherwise be.\n  So far I think we are agreed. My friend, the Senator from California, \nwants to call that second offense the ``interruption'' of a pregnancy \nrather than the claiming of the life of a child.\n  I appeal to the Senate, and to the country, through the Chair, and \nask what our understanding is, what our instinctual reaction is to that \nkind of a crime.\n  When a woman loses a child in that kind of instance, she has not lost \na pregnancy, she has lost a child.\n  Earlier in our marriage, my wife had several miscarriages. She did \nnot think of it as losing a pregnancy. She lost children. That is why \npeople have memorial services sometimes--often--in cases like that. \nThat is why they go through a grieving process. That is why they may \nget counseling.\n  I do not see why, with the greatest respect to the substitute \namendment and to the Senator from California, why we cannot conform \nFederal law to that common understanding. I think we should.\n  I understand the sensitivity on the issue of abortion. I really do. I \nthink the Senator from Ohio and the Senator from South Carolina have \ntried to structure this bill to avoid those sensitivities. It is hard \nto do.\n  But just because--for overriding reasons of public policy that some \nhere adhere to very strongly--we cannot recognize the status of this \nchild when mom, for reasons that she thinks are justified, believes she \nmust end the pregnancy, it seems to me, it does not mean we cannot \naccord the child the dignity of the status of a human being when the \nchild has been the victim of a vicious act of violence against both mom \nand the child.\n  I thank my friend again for allowing me to intervene for a moment. I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, I yield to the Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Madam President, I thank the Senator \nfor yielding. I may take a few minutes, I say to the Senator from \nKansas, to explain my relationship to this bill and why I am here \ntoday.\n  No. 1, I want to thank the leadership for allowing the bill to come \nto the floor. Senator Frist and Senator McConnell and our leadership \nteam has worked hard with Senator Daschle to get an agreement so we \ncould come to the floor and debate what I think is an important issue, \nand to allow Senator Feinstein to have her say about how we should \ncraft this bill.\n  In July 1999, this bill was first introduced in the House. I was the \nauthor of the bill. Before I came to Congress, I spent some time in the \nAir Force. Senator DeWine has taken the cause up in the Senate since it \nwas first introduced. I really appreciate all that Mike has done. He \nhas been very sympathetic to what we are trying to do. He was leading \nthe charge in the Senate as this bill was being debated and voted on in \nthe House.\n  But prior to getting into politics, from 1982 to 1988, I served as a \nprosecutor and a defense attorney in the U.S. Air Force domestically \nand overseas. During that experience, I realized at the Federal level \nthere was a gap in law.\n  We had a case involving a pregnant woman who was beaten up, and her \nchild was lost, and she was almost killed. I looked into the idea of \ncharging the offender with the damage done to the unborn child, and \nunder the Uniform Code of Military Justice there was no way to do that. \nSo I was sensitive to it from a prosecutor's point of view early on in \nmy legal career.\n  When I got to Congress, there was an effort in some States to create \nunborn victims statutes, and I associated myself with that effort \nfederally. A lot of pro-life people came over and were very supportive \nof what we are doing. That is true. Pro-life people generally like the \nidea of protecting unborn children whenever they can.\n  Pro-choice people are very sensitive to the fact that a woman should \ndecide what to do with her body in an intimate situation like a \npregnancy. I understand that debate clearly.\n  I am a pro-life person, so I have biased there. But having said that, \nthere are pro-life people who hate this bill. It surprised me, but it \nis true, because in the bill, we wrote it in a way that abortion is not \ncovered at all. As a matter of fact, we preserve, under the current \nlaw--under this bill--the right to have a legal abortion, and you \ncannot prosecute the mother under any circumstances.\n  There are cases out there where mothers are being prosecuted who \nabuse drugs and alcohol and do damage to their children. What I wanted \nto do was to focus on what I thought we all could agree on, to a large \nextent. The law in abortion and the politics of abortion really do not \nplay well here because we are talking about criminal activity of a \nthird party. I do not know why you would want to give a criminal any \nmore breaks than you had to if they go around beating on pregnant \nwomen.\n  And people say: Well, don't they have to know if the woman is \npregnant? No. Why? The law is really common sense. If you attack a \nwoman of childbearing years, you do so at your own peril. If you push \nsomebody, you do not know if they have a severe medical condition. You \nare liable for the consequences of your actions.\n\n  There are plenty of cases that say, if you attack a woman of \nchildbearing years, you do not have to have actual knowledge. You are \nresponsible for the consequences of your illegal act.\n  In a poll, when people were asked, if a violent, physical attack on a \npregnant woman leads to the death of her unborn child, do you think \nprosecutors should be able to charge the attacker with murder for \nkilling the fetus, 79 percent said yes; 69 percent of pro-choice \npeople, in that poll, said yes.\n  Why would a pro-choice person support this legislation? It passed \nthree times in the House. The first time we had it up for a vote was \nSeptember 30, 1999, I believe. Madam President, 254 folks voted for the \nbill in the House, as I recall. I assure everyone listening to my voice \ntoday, there are not 254 pro-life people in the House. Madam President, \n52 Democrats have voted for this bill.\n  The parties tend to split on the issue of abortion, with the \nDemocratic Party being more pro-choice and the Republican Party being \nmore pro-life. But we had Democratic support, and we had pro-choice \npeople supporting this idea that when it comes to criminal activity, we \nare going to define the unborn in terms that make it hard on the \ncriminal--not hard on the mother.\n  You can never prosecute a woman for anything she does to her child, \nno matter how much you would like to, under this bill. I did not want \nto get into that debate. You can never ever prosecute anybody for \nreceiving medical treatment related to their pregnancy or lawful \nabortion.\n  For over 30 years, in the State of California, two things have \ncoexisted: the Roe v. Wade rights of a woman and a statute that will \nallow you to do what is happening in California today--prosecute a \nperson for doing damage to the mother and the unborn child, such as the \nLaci Peterson case.\n  This has been a long journey. This July will be the fifth anniversary \nof the time that I introduced this bill. Back in 1999, I remember \nsaying on the floor of the House there will be a case where a pregnant \nwoman is brutalized and she loses her child and it will be front-page \nnews.\n  The reason I said that then is, having been a prosecutor and a \ndefense attorney, I understand the following: There are a lot of good \npeople in this world, but there are some mean people, too. This happens \nmore than you would ever want to believe. The No. 1 cause of death \namong pregnant women in the District of Columbia is murder. As much as \nwe would like to believe otherwise, pregnant women have things come \ntheir way because of their pregnancy that shocks the conscience.\n  In Arkansas, there are three people sitting on death row today \nbecause they were hired by the boyfriend, who didn't want to pay child \nsupport, to kidnap his girlfriend, who wanted to\n\n[[Page S3135]]\n\nhave the child, took her off to a remote area and beat her within an \ninch of her life with the express purpose of killing the child. And \nwhen she was on the floor, she begged for two things: Her own life and \nher baby's life. Those people under Arkansas law were charged with two \ncrimes, making them eligible for the death penalty. They deserve to be.\n  Under this bill, you cannot get the death penalty. The reason I chose \nnot to include the death penalty is, I did not want to get into the \ndeath penalty debate because people of goodwill and good reasoning may \ndisagree with the State imposing that punishment. The Senator from \nCalifornia cares as much about pregnant women as anybody here. This is \nnot about who cares about women and who is trying to do this or that. \nHer amendment may not be written the way she would like. I would oppose \nit, if it was changed.\n  It happens in America more times than you would ever believe that \npregnant women are the victim of violent assault and their children get \nkilled or severely injured.\n  That concept can and does exist with the idea that a woman, early on \nin the pregnancy, can choose whether to carry that child. These are two \nconcepts the law recognizes that exist side by side.\n  Why do 84 percent of the people believe a criminal should be \nprosecuted twice, not once? Because it really does violate common \ndecency. If a woman chooses to have a baby and she loses her baby \nbecause of a violent act, most of us, a large percentage of us, want to \nwhack the person who did it as hard as we can. And we don't want to get \ninto the debate about abortion. We want to make sure the prosecutor has \nthe tools to bring about the most severe and just verdict possible.\n  This bill excludes abortion. It excludes the death penalty for \npolitical reasons and legal reasons. Pro-life people have criticized me \nbecause in this bill, in their opinion, I am legalizing abortion. This \nbill doesn't legalize abortion. This bill doesn't ban abortion. This \nbill says: If you are a criminal and you attack a pregnant woman and \nyou hurt her kid, you will get the full force of the law.\n  What is going on in California? In 1999, when I said there will be a \nwoman out there who suffers brutally and loses her child and we will \nall know about it because it will be front page news, I never dreamed \nit would happen so quickly. I never dreamed it would be so vicious. The \nauthorities investigating the Laci Peterson crime have two pieces of \nevidence to offer the jury: The decomposed body of the mother and the \ndecomposed unborn child late in the pregnancy. It is important the jury \nknow about both. It is important the criminal be held accountable for \nboth. We will debate abortion another day.\n\n  Sixteen States define life under the same legal terms I chose when we \nwrote this bill. That is as to the criminal world, if the pregnancy \ncomes to an end and the unborn child's right to develop comes to an end \nbecause of third-party criminal activity, we are going to hold you \nlegally responsible at the earliest onset of pregnancy. The Roe v. Wade \nstandard makes no sense. Why give a criminal a benefit of the \nlegitimate debate of abortion?\n  Thirteen States define it in stages. California, I think by law, \ndefines the unborn victim statute at the sixth week of pregnancy. Some \nStates, one or two, have the term ``viability.'' There is a sliding \nscale. But the dominant way to define this in State law is the way we \nhave chosen to define it in this bill. This chart illustrates how the \nStates break out.\n  There is another situation I would ask you to think about. Let's say \nthere is a woman on death row. She is pregnant for whatever reason. How \nmany people would let the execution go forward knowing the woman is \npregnant? Think about that. What good would it do to allow the \nexecution to go forward if you knew the woman was pregnant? Would you \nwait?\n  Here is what I suggest to you, if any State or the Federal Government \ndecided to impose the death penalty on a woman who was pregnant during \nany stage of the pregnancy, there would be a riot in the street--among \npro-choice people, too, because what good would it do at any stage of \nthe pregnancy to have the State kill the kid? You are not enhancing Roe \nv. Wade. You are not advancing the abortion debate. You are doing \nsomething you don't need to do.\n  The definition that was used in the Innocent Child Protection Act of \n2000, which I was involved in drafting, is the same definition that is \nin this bill about the unborn child. It passed 417 to nothing. To me, \nthat makes perfect sense. Four hundred seventeen pro-life people do not \nexist in the House of Representatives. But when faced with the \nquestion, should the State wait if a woman is pregnant, even at the \nearliest stages of pregnancy, 417 people said yes.\n  The reason I mention this to you is, when it comes time to prosecute \npeople who unlawfully attack a woman at the earliest stage of \npregnancy, why should they get a pass? What good have you done? It does \nnot change the abortion debate. Roe v. Wade rights still exist. All you \nhave done is allow someone to interrupt another person's life, take \nsomething of value, and they get a pass because you are mixing concepts \nthat don't need to be mixed. That is why over 50 pro-choice people \nvoted for this bill in the House.\n  That is why if we ever get to final passage, we are going to have a \nbipartisan coming together of pro-life and pro-choice people to say one \nthing loud and clear: If you attack a woman of childbearing years where \nFederal law applies, you do so at your peril, and you are going to \nsuffer the full consequences of your action. And the full consequences \nof that action could be the loss of the child and the loss of the \nmother or a combination thereof.\n  Why not sentence enhancement? I think there is a reason under the law \nthat no State has gone down this road. Sentence enhancement would say \nthe following: You get a stiffer penalty if the woman is pregnant, but \nyou don't talk about the consequences in terms of the victim's life. \nThat is an artificial distinction that I think denies justice.\n  This was a statement by Kent Willis, executive director of ACLU, and \nI disagree with this statement:\n\n       That baby was not a murder victim.\n\n  He was talking about the Laci Peterson case, the son Connor. I think \nConnor was a murder victim. The point I guess I am trying to make is \nthat when people talk about what happens to them, the law, wherever it \ncan, should address the full range of what really happened to them.\n  There is another case you don't know about because it didn't get \nnearly the publicity, but it is just as real. It is a good example of \nwhy we need this statute.\n  Michael Lenz and his wife were expecting their first child. She \nworked in the Federal Building in Oklahoma City. She was in the \nmidstages of her pregnancy. She went to work early the day of the \nbombing to show an ultrasound to her colleagues of their baby. That was \ngoing on at the moment the bomb goes off. She was killed. Michael Lenz \nIII was killed. They had already named their little baby boy.\n  The father came before my committee when I was in the House to \ntestify for this bill. He said: I am no expert on abortion, but here is \nwhat happened to my family. My wife was killed, and at the same moment \nI lost my son, Michael Lenz III.\n  The reason they lost their son is not because of Roe v. Wade rights; \nit was because of a third party crazy man, a criminal, who destroyed \nmany lives that day. When you look at the victims of the Oklahoma City \nbombing case, when it came time in Federal court, you don't find a \nplace for Michael Lenz III. If this bill had been law, there would have \nbeen 22 people, not 21 people, that would have been before the court. I \ncannot say it any better than that.\n  In terms of Michael Lenz and all the other victims who testified in \nsupport of this legislation, sentence enhancement doesn't speak to what \nhappened to them. From a prosecutor's point of view, it makes all the \ndifference in the world to have two charges facing the accused versus \none. It gives you more leverage than you could ever dream of. Ladies \nand gentlemen, in cases like this, it is the right thing to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I yield as much time as she requires \nto the Senator from California, Mrs. Boxer. She was here a moment ago.\n\n[[Page S3136]]\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, I inquire of the Chair, how much time \ndoes each side have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio has 58 minutes. The \nSenator from California has 62 minutes.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Sixty-two?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Right.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Thank you. Madam President, I yield to the Senator from \nPennsylvania 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Ohio. If \nSenator Feinstein's speaker arrives, I will be happy to abbreviate my \nremarks to accommodate the other side of the aisle.\n  I wanted to congratulate Senator DeWine and Senator Graham, who have \nreally worked hard not just on this legislation, but getting this \nlegislation to a point where we can have an up-or-down vote, have a \nvote on the amendments, and let the Senate work its will. That is one \nof the things we have not seen done in recent weeks. We have had an \nopportunity here on a very important issue to have the Senate's will be \ndone. I also congratulate Senator Frist and Senator McConnell and the \nDemocratic leaders for allowing us to debate this issue. This is an \nimportant debate.\n  I think Senator Graham, who I had the privilege of listening to for a \nfew moments, summarized it very well. The issue is, how many victims \nare there? Do we recognize the loss of a child in the womb, a child who \nis anticipated, is wanted, and whose life is very real to the mother \nand father and the family? When that life is taken away by a third \nparty, do we recognize that child's existence in the law?\n  I don't think anyone would doubt that when a woman who has a child in \nthe womb is attacked and injury comes to that child, another person is \naffected. If the child dies, that child is affected. There is something \nthat goes on to another human being. The issue here is whether we are \ngoing to recognize that in the law. I agree with the Senator from South \nCarolina that it has nothing to do with abortion. It is specifically \nexcluded from this legislation. So why do all of the abortion rights \nactivists have a problem with this legislation?\n  It comes down to the very issue, do we recognize the humanity of a \nchild in womb? How far would we go to protect this right to an \nabortion? Do we go so far as to even deny the existence of a child who \nis not subject to abortion? How far do we go to protect this right, the \nsupreme right above all, the right to an abortion, a right that can \nhave no restriction on it? In fact, it cannot even have a restriction \nthat is not at all applicable to it. So, in other words, we cannot even \ntalk about this, or some way, through some logic, attack the issue. We \nhave to deny under every circumstance that the child in the womb is a \nhuman life. That is what this is about.\n  This is all about denying the humanity of the child. We just cannot \ncontemplate that in our laws. We cannot have any admission anywhere in \nlaw that says what is inside the woman's womb is a child--when, of \ncourse, we all know that is exactly what it is. But we cannot express \nthat legally. If we do, somehow or another, this right to abortion may \nbe threatened down the road. Who cares about what harm we may bring? \nWho cares about what harm we may bring to a mother whose child is \ninjured or what harm we may bring to the family who may lose or have an \ninjury to a child in womb? Who cares that we cannot bring somebody who \nhas done violence to a child in the womb to justice? All of those \nthings are worth ignoring to protect this right that is not even at \nstake today.\n  This issue, as I have said many times, is a cancer. I thought at \nfirst it was a cancer that ate away at us in how we view the \nrelationship between the mother and the child, but it is worse. It is a \ncancer that reaches in and infects even areas that have nothing to do \nwith abortion.\n  We need to let common sense reign in the Senate today. The common \nsense is, this is a child who is loved and wanted by the mother. This \nis a child who, in many cases, has been given a name, such as Conner \nPeterson, and this is a child who deserves the dignity of recognition \nby our society.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DeWINE. I yield to the Senator from Utah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I appreciate my colleague from California \npermitting me to go before her.\n  I rise today to urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the Unborn \nVictims of Violence Act. The importance of this issue has been made \ntragically clear by the grisly murders of Laci Peterson and her unborn \nson Conner. I met with her mother again yesterday and was very \nimpressed with her and how she is handling this situation.\n  This bill will ensure Federal law appropriately protects unborn \nchildren from assault and murder. It has passed the House of \nRepresentatives by a strong bipartisan vote of 254 to 163. I believe \nthe Senate should give similar overwhelming approval.\n  Before I begin the substance of my remarks, I commend Senators DeWine \nand Lindsey Graham for their longstanding and essential leadership on \nthis most important issue and for drafting the legislation that is \nbefore us today. This issue has already been addressed in many States \nacross the country. In fact, in my home State of Utah, if a criminal \nassaults or kills a woman who is pregnant and thereby causes death or \ninjury to the unborn child, the criminal faces the possibility of being \nprosecuted for having taken or injured that unborn life. Twenty-eight \nadditional States have similar laws on the books. Sixteen of those \nStates recognize the unborn child as a victim throughout the entire \nperiod of prenatal development. This is only proper and, it seems to \nme, only just.\n  However, there is a gap in the law under existing Federal criminal \nstatutes. Current Federal law provides for no additional criminal \npenalty when a criminal assaults or kills a woman who is pregnant and \nthereby causes death or injury to that unborn child. It is time \nCongress eliminates this unjustified gap in the law.\n  This bill bridges this existing gap, and it does so in a way that \nprotects the rights of the States. It creates a separate Federal \noffense to kill or injure an unborn child during the commission of \ncertain already defined Federal crimes committed against the unborn \nchild's mother.\n\n  Importantly, because this bill only applies to Federal crimes, it \ndoes not usurp jurisdiction over State law. If someone commits a crime \nthat violates State law, but does not violate any Federal law, then \nState law will prevail, regardless of whether that State has laws that \nprotect unborn victims of violence.\n  I cannot imagine why anyone would oppose this bill.\n  Some have mistakenly characterized this bill as anti-abortion. It is \nnot, and I am not saying that because I am pro-life.\n  Let me take this opportunity to clarify a remark I made on May 7 of \nlast year. I am quoted as saying the bill undermines abortion rights, \nbut that this effect is irrelevant. The point I was trying to make, and \nI guess I did not make it well and it has been quoted out of context \nmany times, is there is no conflict between the bill language and Roe \nv. Wade. Some are prepared to bring the abortion issue into anything, \nany time, for any reason, even when it does not fit, such as in this \ncase.\n  I do not believe this bill in any way undermines abortion rights. It \ncertainly does not.\n  The bill explicitly says the Federal Government cannot prosecute a \npregnant woman for having an abortion. In fact, the bill goes even \nfurther. The bill does not permit prosecution against any woman with \nrespect to her unborn child regardless of whether the mother acted \nlegally or illegally. If a woman chooses not to have her baby, the bill \nsays she can have an abortion without Federal prosecution. That is how \nfar the authors of this bill have gone. But importantly, for those \nwomen who have chosen to keep their baby, this bill says no coldblooded \nmurderer can take that choice away from her by killing her baby and \ngoing unpunished.\n  Those who oppose this bill are, in effect, saying the murderer, not \nthe mother, has the choice to take the baby away from his or her mother\n\n[[Page S3137]]\n\nagainst the mother's will and against the individual's will. Since the \nmurderer will not be punished for this terrible offense, it exonerates \nhis or her actions. That is simply not right.\n  I understand my dear friend Senator Feinstein says this bill somehow \nthreatens stem cell research. It does no such thing. I have been a \nsupporter of embryonic stem cell research, and everyone in this body \nknows it and I guess most scientists throughout the world know that. I \nhave been proud to stand shoulder to shoulder with Senator Feinstein, \nSenator Specter, Senator Kennedy, and Senator Harkin on stem cell \nresearch. I believe we are right on that issue. But this bill in no way \nimpedes stem cell research. This bill is about stopping and punishing \nheinous crimes.\n  Why would I support Laci and Conner's law if it jeopardized that \nresearch? The words ``stem cell research'' are nowhere in the bill. \nThis is a criminal law, not an abortion law.\n  As I have said on many occasions, it is my view life begins in a \nmother's womb. What this bill does is penalize those who act to \nviciously end that life in the womb or any life in the womb.\n  Senator Feinstein, the distinguished Senator from California, \nsuggested this bill somehow may result in assigning legal status to the \nterm ``embryo.'' But I cannot find the term ``embryo'' anywhere in the \nbill. Nor for that matter can I find the term ``embryo'' in the \namendment put forth by the distinguished Senator from California, Mrs. \nFeinstein.\n  In short, this bill does not affect abortion, embryos, or, for that \nmatter, stem cell research. There is no legislative intent here to \nprosecute researchers working on stem cell research--none whatsoever.\n  I have the utmost respect for my dear friend from California, and she \nknows that. We have worked together on many issues during her 12 years \non the Judiciary Committee. I admire her and appreciate working with \nher on so many of these issues. I admire her judicious way in fighting \nfor the issues in which she believes, even when we disagree. If her \nbill truly considered the same crime, I would give strong consideration \nto supporting it. But it does not. It tries to do it, but it does not.\n  The phrase ``interrupt a pregnancy'' is overly vague and will \nprobably be struck down by the courts on that ground. Because of this \nvagueness, the courts may well interpret the Feinstein amendment as \nproviding no additional penalty for a crime committed against a fetus.\n  Some will try to claim this weakens domestic violence laws by \naverting attention to the unborn. That is simply not true. I am a \nstrong supporter of domestic violence laws and, along with Senator \nBiden, was the main writer of those bills. I believe domestic violence \nis an evil plague that needs to be stopped.\n  My commitment to this issue has been longstanding. As many of my \ncolleagues are aware, I was an original cosponsor of the Violence \nAgainst Women Act over a decade ago, and I have tirelessly fought in \ncountless venues to protect the rights of women. This bill furthers \nthat cause.\n  For many years, I have worked hard on the issue of domestic violence \nand violence against women, and when I stand here today before the \nentire Senate and offer my support for a bill, I certainly make sure \nthat bill does not diminish in any way our capacity to curb domestic \nviolence and protect women.\n  The bill before us strengthens the rights of women and provides those \nwho fight against domestic violence with another tool in their arsenal \nto go after abusers. This bill focuses attention on both a pregnant \nwoman and her child. Before the Government could prosecute someone for \nhurting the unborn child, it would first need to prove the pregnant \nwoman was hurt. In other words, the Government needs to prove 1 of 68 \nenumerated predicate Federal crimes against the mother before it could \nobtain a conviction under this provision of this bill.\n  Moreover, this provision empowers abused women because it gives the \nGovernment a greater arsenal of prosecutorial tools to put the abusive \nspouse behind bars for a longer period of time. Many today will talk \nabout the Peterson case. Suffice it to say that the public reaction to \nthat case underscores the widespread support for the changes that we \nare making with H.R. 1997.\n  A news poll taken last April consisting of an almost even split of \npro-life and pro-choice individuals indicated that 84 percent--let me \nrepeat that, 84 percent--believed that Scott Peterson, who is currently \non trial for the murder of his wife, should be charged with two counts \nof homicide for murdering his wife and unborn son.\n  California law permits criminals to be charged with murder for \nkilling an unborn child when that child has developed past the \nembryonic stage. The tragic murder of an innocent unborn child is so \nshocking and so disturbing that regardless of any stance on abortion, \nthe vast majority of all Americans strongly believe an unborn life \ntaken in murder should result in murder charges brought against the \nperpetrator.\n  It is only fair and just to ask for our Federal judicial system to \nincorporate this strong desire of the vast majority of the American \npeople on this issue.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for H.R. 1997. I urge my colleagues to \nvote against amendments to H.R. 1997. Do it for Laci and Conner \nPeterson and for thousands of others in similar situations who have \nbeen abused. Do it for all women who have chosen to have their baby and \nare having that choice taken away from them by a cold-blooded murderer. \nMost of all, do it because it is the right thing to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Talent). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Utah because he \npromised me he would keep within the 15 minutes so that I could get the \nfloor at this time, and I appreciate his cooperation.\n  I also thank my colleague, the senior Senator from California, Mrs. \nFeinstein, for her great leadership on this issue. I also have to \nexpress a little bit of dismay that she was not able to modify her \namendment. It kind of gives one a clue that the people on the other \nside have a different agenda when they say they are not going to allow \na colleague they respect and admire to send a modification to the desk.\n  So I thought I would want to place that on the record because we \nremember. These things we will remember because it is not right to not \nallow a colleague to modify an amendment that she has written. So the \nnext time the other side wants to do it, we will have to think a bit. \nIt is just sad. It is not the way the Senate should work.\n  Senator Feinstein has yielded me 10 minutes of her time, so if the \nChair would tell me when I have used 9 minutes, I would appreciate it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will so notify the Senator.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am very much in favor of enhanced penalties for those \noffenders, those criminals, who harm pregnant women. I think Senator \nFeinstein's substitute amendment is one that does exactly that. What I \ndo not support are the efforts of some Members of this body who clearly \nare the leaders of the anti-choice movement in the Senate. We have \nheard from them seriatim. They have just come right down and spoken. I \ndo not support what they are trying to do, which is to undermine pro-\nchoice laws, particularly Roe v. Wade.\n\n  Now, one can dress up a bill to make it look like anything one wants, \nbut the so-called Unborn Victims of Violence Act, although they try to \ndress it up as a criminal statute designed to deter violence, I think \nhas tremendous weakness in the way it is written and in the way it \nwould prosecute a violent criminal who harms a pregnant woman. It is \nanother effort to undermine Roe v. Wade, which as we know, has given \nwomen in this country the right to choose, and it is a very important \nright of privacy.\n  How do I know this is the supporters' motivation? It is easy for me \nbecause if they wanted to create a law that says we believe that a \npregnant woman should be protected and we want to punish someone who \nharms a pregnant woman, it is a pretty easy thing to just support \nSenator Feinstein's amendment. It is clean; it is clear; she doubles \nthe penalties just as they do in their bill. She avoids the issue, \nhowever, of a woman's right to choose, which this is not about. There \nis nothing about that in this bill.\n  The substitute that Senator Feinstein has offered to us, which is \nlike\n\n[[Page S3138]]\n\nH.R. 1997, creates a separate offense when someone harms a pregnancy or \nterminates a pregnancy while in the commission of a violent Federal \ncrime. That is very important to do because these crimes are heinous \nand all the more heinous if a woman is pregnant. As the author of the \nViolence Against Women Act in the House and working with Senator Biden \nfor 10 years to get it through the Senate and the House and get it \nsigned into law, Senator Feinstein's bill is in tune with that point \nthat we will not stand by and allow violence against women. \nParticularly if a woman is pregnant, it makes the crime more vicious \nand it doubles the penalty for such a crime. It creates the same \nseparate penalty for this separate crime, a maximum of 20 years for \nharm and a maximum of life in the event a pregnancy is terminated. It \ndoes not require proof that the offender had knowledge of the woman's \npregnancy.\n  The sole difference between the substitute that Senator Feinstein is \noffering and the Unborn Victims of Violence Act is that they want to \nbring in the issue of a woman's right to choose, and they want to make \nthis bill about a woman's right to choose.\n  What on Earth does this have to do with a woman's right to choose? \nNothing, not a thing. Senator Feinstein's substitute focuses on the \npregnant woman. That is the issue, the pregnant woman. So one wonders \nwhy the other side cannot accept it. The answer is simple. Again, they \nare trying to make this about abortion, not about convicting a \ncriminal.\n  I want to correct something. When I referenced the House bill, I \nmeant to reference the Zoe Lofgren bill--and I am not sure of that \nnumber--not the House bill that is identical to Senator DeWine's bill. \nZoe Lofgren in the House had a similar bill to Senator Feinstein's \nbill. That bill got a lot of support but not enough support.\n  Again, it is very simple why people over there who are anti-choice \ndid not support the Lofgren bill, and they do not support the Feinstein \nbill, because they want to make this about abortion and they want to \nundermine Roe v. Wade and a woman's right to choose.\n  I am a little bit shocked because the experts who have written to us \nhave told us that the bill that the anti-choice Senators are supporting \nwould make it harder to convict a criminal.\n  For example, Peter Rubin, visiting associate professor at Georgetown \nLaw Center, when he testified before the House Judiciary Committee, \nsaid:\n\n       The phrase ``child in utero'' is ambiguous and would \n     actually aid an offender in avoiding prosecution.\n\n  Imagine. It seems to me the other side is so anxious to undermine Roe \nand to confuse the subject and to make this bill about abortion, they \nare willing to pass an ambiguous bill which would actually aid the \noffender, the criminal, and would actually allow some heinous criminal \nto go free.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Peter Rubin's letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                             Georgetown University\n\n\n                                                   Law Center,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 21, 1999.\n     Re H.R. 2436, The Proposed ``Unborn Victims of Violence Act \n         of 1999''--written testimony of Peter J. Rubin, Visiting \n         Associate Professor of Law, Georgetown University Law \n         Center, before the Subcommittee on the Constitution of \n         the House Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n       I have been asked by this subcommittee to review and \n     comment upon H.R. 2436, which would create a separate federal \n     criminal offense where criminal conduct prohibited under a \n     list of over sixty federal statutes, in the words of the \n     proposed law ``causes the death of, or bodily injury . . . to \n     a child, who is in utero.'' I am honored to have the \n     opportunity to convey my views to the subcommittee.\n       Where an act of violence against a pregnant woman results \n     in a miscarriage, that act of violence has wrought a distinct \n     and unique harm in addition to the harm it would have done \n     had the woman not been pregnant. Similarly, injury to a baby \n     that may result from unlawful violence perpetrated upon its \n     mother when it was a fetus in utero is something from which \n     government may properly seek to protect the woman and the \n     child.\n       Consequently, although many states adhere to the \n     traditional rule that the criminal law reaches only conduct \n     against a person already born alive, some states have enacted \n     laws that penalize conduct that may kill or, in some cases, \n     injure, a fetus in utero. One example is North Carolina's \n     state statute which provides that ``A person who in the \n     commission of a felony causes injury to a woman, knowing the \n     woman to be pregnant, which injury results in a miscarriage \n     or stillbirth by the woman is guilty of a felony that is one \n     class higher than the felony committed.'' (N.C. Gen. State. \n     Sec. 14-18.2.)\n       If the members of Congress conclude that causing injury in \n     this way during the commission of a federal crime warrants \n     additional punishment, it, too, could adopt such a provision. \n     Indeed, it seems as though this is one area on which both \n     sides of the debate about abortion might be able to find \n     common ground in supporting a properly worded statute that \n     might give additional protection to women and their families \n     from this unique class of injury.\n       As currently drafted, however, the proposed statute differs \n     from some state laws on this issue in two critical respects. \n     First is its use of the phrase ``child, who is in utero'' to \n     describe the fetus. This is not the ordinary way statutes \n     refer to fetuses in utero. Indeed, the proposed law appears \n     to be unique in its use of this formulation. The use of this \n     language will likely subject H.R. 2436 to legal challenge, \n     and will likely render the proposed law ineffective in \n     preventing and punishing acts that harm or kill fetuses being \n     carried by pregnant women.\n       Second is the bill's treatment of the fetus solely as a \n     separate victim of certain federal crimes. This approach is \n     different from that taken by some states that have enacted \n     criminal laws addressing fetal injury or death in that it \n     fails to focus at all on the woman who is the victim of the \n     violence that may injure or kill the fetus. It would be far \n     easier to reach common ground with an approach that takes \n     account of the place of the pregnant woman when acts of \n     violence against her lead to fetal injury or death. Indeed, \n     the approach taken by the current statute may lead to some \n     unintended results, and is not consistent with the treatment \n     of the fetus in the American legal tradition.\n       To begin with, the proposed law refers to ``a child, who is \n     in utero at the time the conduct takes place.'' Because it \n     uses these words, the proposed law would likely result more \n     in useless litigation about the statute's meaning than in the \n     prevention and punishment of conduct that results in fetal \n     injury or death. Its use of the phrase ``child, who is in \n     utero'' may give a defendant an argument that the statute is \n     ambiguous, and that he lacked the notice of what acts are \n     criminal that is required by the Due Process Clause of the \n     Fifth Amendment. Does it mean the statute applies only to the \n     injury or death of a ``child,'' that is one who is \n     subsequently born, but who was injured in utero? Does it \n     refer to a fetus past the point of viability? Does it refer \n     to a single-cell fertilized ova that has not yet implanted in \n     the uterine wall? The statute does not tell us.\n       Even if the law is not held inapplicable because of \n     unconstitutional vagueness, the Supreme Court has articulated \n     a doctrine known as the doctrine of ``lenity.'' Rooted in \n     part in separation of powers concerns, this doctrine means \n     that an ambiguous federal criminal statute must be construed \n     in the way most favorable to the defendant, lest an \n     individual be criminally punished for conduct that Congress \n     did not intend to criminalize. At best, the phrase ``child, \n     who is in utero'' is ambiguous here, and a defendant is \n     likely to be able to avoid prosecution for whatever \n     conduct it is that the drafters of this law intend to \n     criminalize.\n       In addition, this statute operates in a very unusual \n     manner. It does not just increase the penalty for unlawful \n     violence against a pregnant woman that results in the death \n     of or injury to a fetus, nor does it criminalize injuring or \n     killing a fetus if one has the requisite mental state and is \n     aware of the woman's pregnancy. Rather it includes fetuses \n     within the universe of persons who may be protected from \n     injury or death resulting from violations of other federal \n     criminal laws.\n       Many state laws address fetal injury and death only in \n     certain circumstances, and, reflecting the unique nature of \n     the developing fetus, many provide some penalty that is \n     different from the penalty that would have applied had the \n     defendant killed or injured a person who was already born. \n     They tend also to take account of the fetus's stage of \n     development. State feticide laws often do not treat even the \n     intentional killing of a fetus through violence perpetrated \n     upon the pregnant woman as murder equivalent to the murder of \n     a person who has been born. Some, like North Carolina, \n     enhance the penalty for the underlying criminal conduct. \n     Others treat even intentional feticide only as manslaughter. \n     Thus, in Mississippi, for example, the law provides that \n     ``The wilful killing of an unborn quick child, by an injury \n     to the mother of such child, which would be murder if it \n     resulted in the death of the mother, shall be manslaughter.'' \n     (Miss. Code. Ann. Sec. 97-3-37.)\n       The proposed law by contrast says that whenever causing \n     death or injury to a person in violation of a listed law \n     would subject an individual to a particular punishment, he \n     shall be subject to the same punishment if he causes death or \n     injury to a fetus. This is true regardless of the stage of \n     fetal development. Whatever its rhetorical force, the \n     proposed law would lead to some unusual, and probably \n     unintended, results. To give just one example, under the \n     Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act (``FACE''), 18 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 248,\n\n[[Page S3139]]\n\n     one of the statues listed in H.R. 2436, if an individual who \n     is engaged in obstructing access to an abortion clinic knocks \n     a pregnant woman to the ground during a demonstration, he is \n     liable to imprisonment for up to one year. If he causes her \n     ``bodily injury'' when he knocks her down, he would be \n     subject under FACE to a ten-year term of imprisonment. Under \n     the proposed law, however, if she miscarried as a result of \n     being knocked down, he would be subject to life imprisonment, \n     the same as if his action had caused the death of the woman \n     herself.\n       In addition to being far more practical, it would be fare \n     easier to reach common ground on this issue with adoption of \n     a statute similar to those state statutes, providing for \n     enhanced punishments that I have described. For in addition \n     to the practical consequences, the use of a statutory \n     framework, that seeks to achieve its result through treating \n     all fetuses at all stages of development as persons distinct \n     from the women who carry them unnecessarily places federal \n     statutory law on the path toward turning the pregnant women \n     into the adversary rather than the protector of this fetus \n     she carries. For although this law contains exceptions for \n     abortion, for medical treatment of the woman or the fetus and \n     for the woman's own conduct--exceptions that are both wise \n     and constitutionally required--if the fetus were truly a \n     ``person,'' there would be no principled reason to include \n     such exceptions. Yet of course a law that did not contain \n     them would be shocking to most Americans and both obviously \n     and facially unconstitutional.\n       Finally, then, in failing to take account of the women, the \n     proposed statute also sets federal law apart from the \n     American legal and constitutional tradition with respect to \n     the treatment of the fetus. As the Supreme Court has, \n     described, ``the unborn have never been recognized in the law \n     as persons in the whole sense.'' At common law, the \n     destruction of a fetus in utero was not recognized as \n     homicide unless the victim was born alive. And, of course, \n     the Supreme Court has held that fetuses are not persons \n     within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment. This is a \n     position with which even as staunch an opponent of Roe v. \n     Wade as Justice Antonin Scalia agrees.\n       In addition, therefore, to the practical and political \n     considerations that counsel in favor of an alternative \n     approach, the proposed law would also unnecessarily set \n     federal statutory law on a conceptual collision course with \n     the Supreme Court's abortion decisions. Whatever one may \n     think of those decisions, an unnecessary conflict about them \n     would not contribute to the important work of healing where \n     possible the country's division over abortion.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Then you have Jon Jennings who in 1999 was the Acting \nAssistant Attorney General. He submitted a letter to Representative \nHenry Hyde on behalf of the Justice Department. He also wrote the law \nwould be hard to prosecute because of the difficulty in gathering \nevidence.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have Jon Jennings' letter printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       U.S. Department of Justice,\n\n\n                                Office of Legislative Affairs,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 9, 1999.\n     Hon. Henry Hyde,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. House of \n         Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: This letter presents the views of the \n     Department of Justice on H.R. 2436, the ``Unborn Victims of \n     Violence Act of 1999.''\n       Section 2 of H.R. 2436 would make it a separate federal \n     offense to cause ``death or bodily injury'' to ``a child in \n     utero'' in the course of committing any one of 68 enumerated \n     federal crimes. The punishment for the new crime under H.R. \n     2436 is the same as if the harm had been inflicted upon the \n     ``unborn child's mother,'' except that the death penalty is \n     not permitted. Section 3 of H.R. 2436 would make \n     substantively identical amendments to the Uniform Code of \n     Military Justice.\n       The Justice Department strongly objects to H.R. 2436 as a \n     matter of public policy and also believes that in specific \n     circumstances, illustrated below, the bill may raise a \n     constitutional concern. The Administration has made the fight \n     against domestic violence and other violence against women a \n     top priority. The Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), which \n     passed with the bipartisan support of Congress in 1994, has \n     been a critical turning point in our national effort to \n     address domestic violence and sexual assault. VAWA, for the \n     first time, created federal domestic violence offenses with \n     strong penalties to hold violent offenders accountable. While \n     most domestic violence crimes are appropriately prosecuted at \n     the state and local level, the Department of Justice has \n     brought 179 VAWA and VAWA-related federal indictments to \n     date, and this number continues to grow. In addition, the \n     Department of Justice alone has awarded well over $700 \n     million through VAWA grant programs since 1994, directing \n     critical resources to communities' efforts to respond to \n     domestic violence and sexual assault. These funds have \n     made a difference in women's lives, and in how communities \n     respond to violence against women. Indeed, these funds \n     have helped save the lives of many victims of domestic \n     violence.\n       If the Committee wants to make a difference in the lives of \n     women victims of violence, it should reauthorize the Violence \n     Against Women Act. We hope that Congress will work with us on \n     this common goal. H.R. 2436, however, is not an adequate \n     response to violence against women. Our three main objections \n     to H.R. 2436 are described below.\n       First, H.R. 2436 provides that the punishment for a \n     violation shall be the same as the punishment that would have \n     been imposed had the pregnant woman herself suffered the \n     injury inflicted upon her fetus. The Department agrees that \n     some additional punishment may be warranted for injury to \n     pregnant women. H.R. 2436, however, would trigger a \n     substantial increase in sentence as compared with the \n     sentence that could otherwise be imposed for injury to a \n     woman who is not pregnant.\n       Second, H.R. 2436 expressly provides that the defendant \n     need not know or have reason to know that the victim is \n     pregnant. The bill thus makes a potentially dramatic increase \n     in penalty turn on an element for which liability is strict. \n     As a consequence, for example, if a police officer uses a \n     slight amount of excessive force to subdue a female suspect--\n     without knowing or having any reason to believe that she was \n     pregnant--and she later miscarries, the officer could be \n     subject to mandatory life imprisonment without possibility of \n     parole, even though the maximum sentence for such use of \n     force on a non-pregnant woman would be 10 years. This \n     approach is an unwarranted departure from the ordinary rule \n     that punishment should correspond to culpability, as evinced \n     by the defendant's mental state.\n       Third, H.R. 2436's identification of a fetus as a separate \n     and distinct victim of crime is unprecedented as a matter of \n     federal statute. Such an approach is unnecessary for \n     legislation that would augment punishment of violence against \n     pregnant women. Additionally, such an approach is unwise to \n     the extent that it may be perceived as gratuitously plunging \n     the federal government into one of the most--if not the \n     most--difficult and complex issues of religious and \n     scientific consideration and into the midst of a variety of \n     State approaches to handling these issues.\n       Our policy concerns with H.R. 2436 are exacerbated by the \n     likelihood that the bill will yield little practical benefit. \n     Because the criminal conduct that would be addressed by H.R. \n     2436 is already the subject of federal law (since any assault \n     on an ``unborn child'' cannot occur without an assault on the \n     pregnant woman), H.R. 2436 would not provide for the \n     prosecution of any additional criminals. At the same time, \n     prosecutors proceeding under H.R. 2436 would be likely to \n     encounter difficulty collecting evidence to support their \n     prosecutions. For instance, the prosecutor would have to \n     establish that the defendant's conduct ``cause[d]'' the \n     injury--given the inherent risk of miscarriage and birth \n     defects that occur absent any human intervention, causation \n     may be very difficult to establish.\n       Finally and critically, the drafters of H.R. 2436 are \n     careful to recognize that abortion-related conduct is \n     constitutionally protected. The bill accordingly prohibits \n     prosecution for conduct relating to a consensual abortion or \n     an abortion where consent ``is implied by law in a medical \n     emergency.'' Without this exception, the bill would be \n     plainly unconstitutional. Including the exception does not, \n     however, remove all doubt about the bill's constitutionality. \n     The bill's exception for abortion-related conduct does not, \n     on its face, encompass situations in which consent to an \n     abortion may be implied by law (if, for example, the pregnant \n     woman is incapacitated) even though there is no medical \n     emergency. In this situation, the bill may unduly infringe on \n     constitutionally protected conduct.\n       For these reasons, we strongly oppose H.R. 2436. The \n     Administration, however, would work with Congress to develop \n     alternative legislation that would strengthen punishment for \n     intentional violence against women whom the perpetrator knows \n     or should know is pregnant, strengthen the criminal \n     provisions of VAWA, and reauthorize the grant programs \n     established by this historic legislation.\n       Thank you for this opportunity to present our views. The \n     Office of Management and Budget has advised us that from the \n     standpoint of the Administration, there is no objection to \n     submission of this letter. Please do not hesitate to call \n     upon us if we may be of further assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Jon P. Jennings,\n                                Acting Assistant Attorney General.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Then there is a recent letter of George Fisher, a tenured \nprofessor at Stanford, former prosecutor and expert on the criminal \njustice system.

I yield as much time as she may require.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my colleague.\n  I ask unanimous consent the letter from George Fisher be printed in \nthe Record.\n\n[[Page S3140]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                          Stanford Law School,\n\n                                      Stanford, CA, July 10, 2003.\n     Senator Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Hart Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein, I wish to express my concern about \n     the current formulation of S. 1019, the Unborn Victims of \n     Violence Act of 2003. Although I fully endorse the Bill's \n     ultimate aim of protecting pregnant women from the physical \n     and psychological trauma of an endangered or lost pregnancy, \n     I believe that the Bill's current formulation will frustrate \n     rather than forward this goal.\n       I write both as a former persecutor and as a law professor \n     specializing in criminal law and criminal prosecution. At the \n     outset of my career, I served as an assistant district \n     attorney in Middlesex County, Mass., and as an assistant \n     attorney general in the Massachusetts Attorney General's \n     office. I then went to Boston College Law School, where I \n     administered and taught in the criminal prosecution clinic. I \n     have been at Stanford since 1995 and a tenured professor of \n     law since 1999; during the next academic year, I will serve \n     as Academic Associate Dean. In 1996 I founded Stanford's \n     criminal prosecution clinic and have administered and taught \n     in the clinic ever sine. I have also created a course in \n     prosecutorial ethics, which I taught at Boston College Law \n     School and, as a visitor, at Harvard Law School.\n       My background and interest in criminal prosecution prompt \n     me to raise three objections to this Bill. All of them focus \n     on the Bill's use of the expressions ``child in utero'' and \n     ``child, who is in utero,'' and on its definition of these \n     terms as ``a member of the species homo sapiens, at any stage \n     of development, who is carried in the womb.''\n       First: The Bill's apparent purpose of influencing the \n     course of abortion politics will discourage prosecutions \n     under any future Act.\n       I do not know what motives gave rise to the Bill's use of \n     the expressions ``child in utero'' and ``child, who is in \n     utero,'' but I do know that any vaguely savvy reader will \n     conclude that these terms and the Bill's definition of \n     them were intended by the Bill's authors to influence the \n     course of abortion politics. It is a fair prediction that \n     when a pro-life President is in office, prosecutions under \n     this Bill will be more frequent than when a pro-choice \n     President is in office. That is because the public will \n     interpret this Bill as suggesting that abortion is a \n     potentially criminal act and will interpret prosecutions \n     under the Bill as endorsing this sentiment.\n       If the authors of the Bill truly seek to protect unborn \n     life from criminal violence, they will better accomplish this \n     purpose by avoiding such expressions as ``child in utero.'' \n     Better alternatives would refer to injury or death to a fetus \n     or damage to or termination of a pregnancy.\n       Second: The Bill's apparent purpose of influencing the \n     course of abortion politics will motivate prosecutors to \n     exclude those prospective jurors who otherwise would be most \n     sympathetic to the prosecution's case.\n       If I were prosecuting a case under this Bill, I would hope \n     to have a jury that includes persons deeply sensitive to the \n     rights and interests of pregnant women. Such jurors would \n     regard an attack on a pregnant woman as being a twofold \n     crime, comprising both the injury directly inflicted on the \n     mother and the stark emotional and physical trauma resulting \n     from injury to or loss of her pregnancy.\n       But such jurors also will be more likely than others to \n     believe that pregnant women have the right to exercise \n     autonomy over their bodies and to choose whether to abort a \n     pregnancy. I predict that many or most judges will bar \n     prosecutors and defense counsel from questioning prospective \n     jurors about their views on abortion or about related matters \n     such as their religion, religious practices, or political \n     affiliations. Forced to act largely on instinct, prosecutors \n     may be inclined to exercise peremptory challenges against \n     those prospective jurors who appear to be most sympathetic to \n     the rights of pregnant women. This result clearly would \n     frustrate the Bill's stated purpose of protecting unborn life \n     from criminal violence.\n       Third: The Bill's apparent purpose of influencing the \n     course of abortion politics offends the integrity of the \n     criminal law.\n       To anyone who cares deeply about the integrity of the \n     criminal law, this Bill's apparent attempt to insert an \n     abortion broadside into the criminal code is greatly \n     offensive. The power to inflict criminal penalties is, second \n     only to the power to wage war, the highest trust invested in \n     our institutions of government. Because the power to make and \n     enforce criminal laws inherently carries enormous potential \n     for abuse, those who exercise that power must always do so \n     with a spirit free of any ulterior political motive. The \n     American Bar Association's Standards Relating to the \n     Administration of Criminal Justice provide that ``[i]n making \n     the decision to prosecute, the prosecutor should give no \n     weight to the personal or political advantages or \n     disadvantages which might be involved. . . .'' (Standard 3-\n     3.9(d).) Not all prosecutors conduct themselves with fidelity \n     to this principle, but we may readily condemn those who do \n     not. We may likewise condemn other public actors who abuse \n     the sacred public trust of the criminal sanction for \n     political ends.\n       For these reasons, I object to the current formulation of \n     the Unborn Victims of Violence Bill. As I am confident that \n     an alternative version of the Bill can fully accomplish its \n     stated purpose of protecting unborn life from criminal \n     violence while avoiding each of the difficulties I have \n     outlined above, I strongly encourage the Senate to modify the \n     Bill in the ways I have suggested above or in some other \n     manner that avoids the freighted and frankly politicized \n     terms, ``child in utero'' and ``child, who is in utero.''\n       My thanks to you for your consideration of my views.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    George Fisher,\n                                                 Professor of Law.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, according to the experts, creating a \nseparate offense for a child in utero would make it less likely that \nsomeone who harms or terminates a pregnancy would be convicted of a \nseparate offense. So I find it stunning that, rather than back Senator \nFeinstein's substitute, which is very clear--you harm a pregnant woman, \nyou are going to do double the time, you are going to get double the \npunishment, and it avoids all question of Roe v. Wade--it shocks me my \ncolleagues on the other side would rather have a weaker bill, soft on \nthe criminal, soft on crime, in order to undermine Roe v. Wade. It is \nan injection of a political agenda into the criminal justice system \nwhich I think harms the integrity of the system.\n  Again, I am at a loss for words. That is hard for me to believe. But \nif you look at domestic violence groups, they will tell you how they \nfeel about it. They say they don't support the legislation. They feel \nit would actually be harmful to battered women.\n  Again, as someone who coauthored the Violence Against Women Act with \nSenator Biden, here we have a piece of legislation that is going to be \nharmful to battered women. Yet the other side will not support Senator \nFeinstein's amendment, which absolutely avoids this problem.\n  Juley Fulcher, public policy director of the National Coalition \nAgainst Domestic Violence, who testified before the House subcommittee \nin July 2003, said in her written statement:\n\n       The bill is not designed to protect women and does not help \n     victims of domestic violence. Instead, the focus often will \n     be shifted to the impact of the crime on the unborn embryo or \n     fetus, once again diverting the attention of the legal system \n     away from domestic violence or other forms of violence \n     against women.\n\n  I commend to my colleagues the July 8, 2003 testimony of Juley \nFulcher before the Subcommittee on the Constitution of the House \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  We also have a letter from Lynn Rosenthal, the executive director of \nthe National Network to End Domestic Violence, and the letter of Esta \nSoler, president of the Family Violence Prevention Fund. I ask \nunanimous consent to have them printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           National Network to End\n\n\n                                            Domestic Violence,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 18, 2004.\n       Dear Member of Congress: The National Network to End \n     Domestic Violence (NNEDV), a social change organization \n     representing state domestic violence coalitions, is dedicated \n     to creating a social, political and economic environment \n     where violence against women no longer exists. We are writing \n     because we know that you will soon be considering the Unborn \n     Victims of Violence Act (UVVA). We know that this is a \n     difficult and emotional issue, and that you are carefully \n     considering your position.\n       After very careful consideration and study on our part, we \n     have concluded that the UVVA is not the appropriate remedy \n     for addressing violence against pregnant women. We certainly \n     share the concerns of the sponsors of the legislation about \n     tragic crimes such as the murder of Laci Peterson and other \n     pregnant women. We know that Congress is seeking tools and \n     remedies to address such violence, and appreciate your \n     ongoing support for the Violence Against Women Act. Our \n     concerns about the UVVA are mainly focused on its potential \n     impact on the safety and status of women who are victims of \n     domestic violence.\n       Our first concern is that the legislation could potentially \n     remove the focus on the women as the victim of violence. It \n     would be possible under the UVVA that a violent crime \n     specifically targeted at a woman could be prosecuted with the \n     fetus presented as the primary victim. Yet, it is the violent \n     act against the woman that is at the root of the devastating \n     injuries to the women and the pregnancy. In our view, \n     legislation and policy should be focused on recognizing \n     violence against women as the serious crime it is, and need \n     not rely on loss of a pregnancy to vigorously prosecute these \n     crimes.\n\n[[Page S3141]]\n\n       Our second concern is that while the UVVA on its face seems \n     to protect women from prosecution of the violence causes her \n     to lose the pregnancy, it may lead to a slippery slope that \n     erodes women's rights and holds them responsible for this \n     loss. This slippery slope has already formed in South \n     Carolina and California, two states with unborn victims \n     legislation. For example, in Whitner v. State, the court \n     found that South Carolina's child endangerment statute could \n     be used to punish a pregnant woman who engaged in any \n     behavior that might endanger her fetus.\n       Legislation regarding violence against women must be \n     carefully considered in order to prevent unintended effects \n     from hurting the very women it is supposed to help. Battered \n     women cannot control the violence against them, and should \n     not face the possibility of prosecution simply because they \n     are victims of domestic violence. The landmark case of \n     Nicholson v. Williams, decided in the Eastern District of New \n     York, represents an enormous step in clarifying this \n     position. The federal district court in Nicholson found that \n     mothers' due process rights had been violated when their \n     children were taken away from them merely because they were \n     victims of abuse. That decision correctly puts the emphasis \n     on the abused woman, and stands for the proposition that an \n     abused woman should not be punished, or prosecuted, for \n     occurrences beyond her control.\n       Because of our work with battered women, we do know that \n     violence often occurs during pregnancy, and that pregnant \n     women may be both physically and psychologically more \n     vulnerable to such abuse. We believe that by supporting \n     sentencing enhancements, Congress can advance both its goals \n     of protecting victims of domestic violence and providing a \n     legal sanction for loss of pregnancy as a result of \n     battering. Sentencing enhancements appropriately punish the \n     additional injuries that such acts cause without causing the \n     unnecessary complications, and potentially dangerous \n     consequences, for the women we serve.\n       There are also a number of other steps Congress can take to \n     more effectively address the problem of violence against \n     women. First, Congress can fully fund the Violence against \n     Women Act. Unfortunately, the 2004 budget includes $16.1 \n     million in cuts to the STOP grant program, which provides \n     funding to states, tribes and territories to enhance the law \n     enforcement response to domestic violence and sexual assault, \n     improve prosecution and support victim services. These cuts \n     will have a detrimental impact on communities all across the \n     country that are struggling to maintain core interventions \n     for victims. In addition, the Battered Women's Shelter and \n     Services funding was also cut in 2004, and remains at $48 \n     million below the authorized level. Funds to battered women's \n     programs and rape crisis centers have also received cuts at \n     the local and state level over the past several years. These \n     losses are devastating to providers facing bruised and \n     bleeding women every day. Congress can work to address the \n     problem of violence against women by fully funding these \n     life-saving services.\n       Thank you for considering our perspective on the UVVA. \n     While the bill is noble in its intentions, we are concerned \n     that it may not fulfill its purpose of creating a legal \n     atmosphere in which women feel protected from violence. \n     Please feel free to call me if you need any additional \n     information. We appreciate for your commitment to ending \n     violence against women, and look forward to continuing to \n     work with you to address this most urgent social problem.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Lynn Rosenthal,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                    End Abuse,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 23, 2004.\n     Hon. Jerrold Nadler,\n     2334 RHOB,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Representative Nadler: On behalf of the Family \n     Violence Prevention Fund, I am writing to express concern \n     about the Unborn Victims of Violence Act, H.R. 1997, passed \n     by the House Judiciary Committee on January 21. We are deeply \n     disappointed that some are promoting this bill as a way to \n     end domestic violence, when better and more direct measures \n     to stop family violence languish in Congress year after year. \n     Members of Congress who want to stop abuse will put their \n     energy into passing the prevention and intervention measures \n     that offer great promise to stop violence before it starts.\n       The murder of Laci Peterson was an unspeakable tragedy, but \n     many laws designed as quick fixes have caused great harm. For \n     example, mandatory domestic violence health reporting laws \n     deter women from seeking the medical help they need. We need \n     to stop back and consider what actually works. Our goal must \n     be to stop violence against all women, regardless of whether \n     they are pregnant.\n       If Congress is serious about stopping domestic violence \n     against pregnant women and helping women and children who are \n     victims, Members will quickly pass the Domestic Violence \n     Screening, Treatment and Prevention Act, H.R. 1267. This \n     essential bill would train health care providers to routinely \n     screen female patients for a lifetime history of abuse and \n     give women access to critical domestic violence services when \n     abuse is identified. Introduced in the House in March of 2003 \n     by Representatives Lois Capps (D-CA) and Steven LaTourette \n     (R-OH), this bill has the potential to prevent tragedies by \n     helping victims before violence escalates.\n       We also urge Congress to fully fund all Violence Against \n     Women Act programs and support legislation that would \n     actually prevent domestic violence before it begins. Domestic \n     violence prevention legislation should include services for \n     children who are exposed to abuse, programs that support \n     young families at risk of violence, and efforts to each young \n     men and boys how to develop healthy, non-violent \n     relationships. Such legislation would do much more to stem \n     the tide of domestic violence than the Unborn Victims of \n     Violence Act.\n       Finally, we wish to thank you for your continued leadership \n     and support on this issue. As an advocate in Congress and as \n     one of our Founding Fathers, you truly make a difference in \n     the movement to end violence against women and children. If \n     we can be of assistance, please do not hesitate to contact \n     Kiersten Steward in our Washington, D.C. office at 202-682-\n     1212.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                   Esta Soler,\n\n                                        President, Family Violence\n                                                  Prevention Fund.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Here we have it. I am going to finish with this. We have \na bill before us Senator Feinstein has improved greatly. We have a bill \nbefore us that, instead of concentrating on punishing the violent \ncriminal, concentrates instead on trying to set the stage to reverse \nRoe v. Wade, which the vast majority of people in this country think is \na good law that balances the rights of the woman and the rights of the \nfetus. Yet they are so interested in doing this that they have a bill \nthat is going to make it difficult to convict the criminal who commits \nthe heinous crime against the pregnant woman. It shows you how far the \nother side will go.\n  When we reach out our hand, as we have done many times with them, \nthey will not take our hand. They push it away, because they are much \nmore interested in the political agenda of taking away a woman's right \nto choose.\n  My heart goes out to Laci Peterson's family and to all the other \nfamilies that have experienced the tragedy of losing a loved one to a \nviolent crime and, on top of that, losing the joy I and Senator \nFeinstein have of having grandchildren.\n  But we need to pass laws here that will make matters better, not make \nmatters worse. We need to pass laws here that are clean, that will make \nthe law clear and not murky. I think Senator Feinstein's substitute--\nshe wrote it with the Laci Peterson family in her heart. She wants to \nmake sure criminals who would attack a pregnant woman are brought to \njustice and we don't get diverted to some other issues.\n  I am proud to stand with my colleague on this one. I know how hard \nthis is. I know how hard she has worked. I will support her substitute \nvery proudly, knowing it is the right thing to do, to crack down \nagainst these heinous crimes and to protect pregnant women.\n  I thank her very much, and I yield the floor and reserve the \nremainder of Senator Feinstein's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Kansas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, on behalf of the Senator from Ohio, I \nyield myself such time as I might consume on his side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I inquire first how much time is \nremaining for the Senator from Ohio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 41 minutes remaining on the \nSenator's side.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I thank my colleagues for being here to participate in a difficult \ndebate. I have a difficult set of stories I want to tell. If any of the \nindividuals here in this body, or watching, are interested in talking \nto the individuals involved, they are actually outside in the lobby. I \ninvite anybody to come out. There are grandparents, mothers of \nvictims--there are the women who themselves were assaulted and lost a \nchild. They are here. For those individuals here would care to visit \nwith them, they would love to have a chance to tell their story.\n  The question is simple: do we have one victim or two involved in \nviolent crimes such as these? That is the simple question. I will \npresent a series of case studies to my colleagues and then I will ask \nmy question again--colleagues, do we have here one victim, or two?\n\n[[Page S3142]]\n\n  We start with the story of Christina and Ashley Nicole Alberts. We \nhave a chart which presents a heartbreaking picture. I think it needs \nto be shown to better tell the story. This is a gut-wrenching picture \nof Christina and Ashley Nicole Alberts (you can see them there in the \ncoffin). It is a difficult picture. This body needs to know what the \nUnborn Victims of Violence Act is about--the victim.\n  I ask my colleagues to bear in mind that the Unborn Victims of \nViolence Act states there are two victims--there are two victims in \nthis picture. The amendment we are considering right now, the Feinstein \namendment, says there is only one victim--one victim in this picture. I \nsimply ask my colleagues to make that determination. Is there one \nvictim or are there two in this picture? Here is the story.\n  In December 1998, Christina was nearly 9 months pregnant.\n  Ashley was looking forward to life with her soon-to-be-born daughter \nwhom she could definitely feel moving, alive and well, and growing in \nher womb. When she found out she was going to have a girl, she decided \nto name her Ashley Nicole.\n  However, this earthly life--which all of us living and breathing here \ntoday enjoy--tragically came to a screeching halt for Christina and \nNicole on December 12, 1998. On that day, some thugs were going around \nrobbing homes for money. The thugs entered the house where Christina \nwas. Christina recognized one of them, and because she recognized one \nof them, it cost her and her baby Ashley Nicole their lives.\n  Christina was beaten. Can you imagine someone beating a woman in the \nninth month of her pregnancy? Yet they did. I think of my own family \nand my own wife if she were in that type of situation.\n  Christina was then forced to kneel, and she was executed--shot in the \nhead. Once the trigger had been pulled, releasing the bullet that \nabruptly ended her life, one might think at least the physical pain \nfrom the crime was over for Ashley Nicole. It was not. When her \nmother's heart stopped, her inutero child does not die instantly. \nInstead, the inutero baby dies slower. When the mother's heart stops \nbeating, the baby begins to suffocate for lack of oxygen. The baby can \nfeel. The baby is in pain. At 4 minutes, the baby begins to suffer \nsevere neurological damage. The process gets worse. Ashley Nicole would \nhave finally died 15 minutes after her mother Christina had been shot \nand killed.\n  Look at this photo again of Christina and Ashley in the coffin. Is \nthere one victim? Or are there two? Who will say there is only one \nvictim in this coffin? Yet this substitute amendment we are considering \nwill say there is only one victim.\n  What about the family? What about Ashley Nicole's grandparents? What \nhappened to them after the murders? Christina and Ashley Nicole lived \nin Kanawah County, West Virginia.\n  Her grandmother is here today.\n  In addition to the horrific news of their daughter and \ngranddaughter's murder, they were further traumatized to learn the West \nVirginia murder statute does not allow the prosecution of an individual \nfor the murder of an unborn child.\n  Do you know what happened in the murder trial for Christina and \nAshley's killer? Christina's pregnancy could not even be discussed in \ncourt. Any recent photos of Christina shown during the trial could only \nshow facial shots. Why? Because the court said any pictures of \nChristina in which it would have been obvious she was pregnant would \nhave been prejudiced.\n  I ask my friends from West Virginia to support their constituents, \nthe Alberts, by opposing the Feinstein substitute and voting for \npassage of unamended Unborn Victims of Violence Act.\n  I have another story to tell--Heather Fliegelman Sargent.\n  In this picture with her mother, as you can see, 20-year-old Heather \nwas well into her pregnancy. Heather was 8 months pregnant with her son \nJonah.\n  I also point out that her mother and the grandmother of Jonah are \nhere with us today in the lobby, if people should care to visit with \nher.\n  Sadly, both the lives of Heather and Jonah were taken in January \n2003, over a year ago. Heather was found dead with multiple stab wounds \nin her home in Bangor, ME. Her husband Roscoe Sargent was tried on \none--only one--count of murder.\n  The Bangor Daily News reported on January 10, 2003: ``That Heather \nSargent was pregnant did not affect the charges brought against her \nhusband . . . No matter how advanced the pregnancy, Maine's homicide \nlaw does not apply to unborn fetuses.''\n  But listen to this. Another news story on that same day, January 2, \n2003, tells us that ``Police also reportedly found several dead cats at \nhome. Whoever killed the cats faces charges under the State's animal \nwelfare act, while no charges will stem from the death of the unborn \nbaby.''\n\n  Is it even remotely rational to charge someone with the death of \nthese cats and yet not charge them with the death of a viable 8-month-\nold baby?\n  As we move to the next chart in the same case, I want to pause for a \nmoment and urge caution for any parents who may be watching with young \nchildren present. They may not want to view this. It is a serious \nmatter, and these are real life stories that people need to hear. But, \nnonetheless, they are difficult.\n  I would simply ask as we move to the next chart, are we looking at \none victim or two? On the left in the chart is Heather before she was \nstabbed to death, and on the right is Jonah who also died in the \nattack.\n  The grandmother of Jonah is here with us today.\n  I hope Senators will hear the pleas of their constituents--the family \nof Heather and Jonah who are here in the Senate today watching, as I \nnoted. Please, in their behalf, on behalf of Heather and Jonah, oppose \nthis substitute that says there is only one victim.\n  The Feinstein substitute would increase penalties for Federal crimes \nin which a pregnant woman is a victim, but it would also write into \nFederal law the doctrine that such a crime has only a single victim. If \nwe pass this Feinstein amendment, and a mother survives such an attack, \nshe will be told, ``We can prosecute your attacker for assault but not \nfor murder--the law says nobody died.''\n  This cannot and should not be. On behalf of Heather and Jonah, I urge \nmy colleagues to oppose the Feinstein substitute and support the \nunderlying bill un-amended.\n  I have another story to tell. This picture shows the late Ashley \nLyons of Kentucky. Ashley was killed when she was 21 weeks pregnant \nwith her son Landon, in January of this year--just 3 months ago.\n  Her parents and Landon's grandparents are here today. They are in the \nlobby, if anybody would care to meet with them. I have met personally \nwith them. They are very passionate about this case and about what took \nplace. If Ashley and her son Landon were with us today, they would be \nplanning for Landon's birth in just a little over a month. I have a \nstaff member who is expecting a child in a little over a month, so this \nreally hits home.\n  Rather than telling the story of Ashley and Landon myself,I would \nlike to read their story as it was written by the mother and \ngrandmother, Mrs. Carol Lyons. As I noted, Mrs. Carol Lyons is with us \nhere today, along with her husband Buford. It was their efforts that \nhelped get an unborn victims law passed in Kentucky--too late for their \ndaughter and grandson, but not too late for other victims.\n  I will read you this story which actually quotes Ashley, as written \nby her mother, the grandmother of Landon. It was written February 25, \n2004.\n  I note parenthetically that if this crime had happened on a military \nbase where only Federal law applies, there would be only one victim--\nnot two--unlike California law, which acknowledges two victims of \nviolence.\n  Ashley's mother writes:\n\n       On January 7, I was seeing my grandson, Landon, for the \n     first time. Landon was moving around in an ultrasound image \n     on the TV screen in our home in Stomping Ground, Kentucky. We \n     could clearly see Landon's little heart beating. We could see \n     his little face. Just a few hours later, Ashley and Landon \n     were both dead. They were found murdered--shot to death in a \n     local park.\n\n  Later, I found a journal that Ashley had been writing to her baby. \nRight at the beginning, when she was only two months pregnant, she \nwrote how she had rejected advice to get an abortion.\n\n[[Page S3143]]\n\n  Clearly Ashley made a choice to have a child. She wrote in her \njournal: ``I couldn't do that. I already loved you.''\n  Ashley also wrote: ``You are the child I have always dreamed about. I \nknow that it will be a long time before I meet you, but I can't wait to \nhold you for the first time. I love you more everyday. Always, Mommy.''\n\n       Yes, the killer took two lives--each with a long, bright \n     future ahead. It is heartless and cruel to say that the law \n     must pretend this is not so, in order to preserve ``choice'' \n     on abortion. Ashley had made her choice--and she chose life.\n\n  This, again, is her mother Carol speaking.\n\n       Our case has been widely reported in Kentucky. In response, \n     both houses of the legislature passed a strong fetal homicide \n     bill, and on January 20th, Governor Ernie Fletcher signed it \n     into law.\n       I pray that Congress, too, will soon pass the Unborn \n     Victims of Violence Act, which will allow a criminal to be \n     charged for any harm he does to an unborn child during \n     commission of a Federal or military crime.\n       Of course, laws are not retroactive, so no laws enacted now \n     will allow full justice to be done on Landon's behalf.\n       But they will ensure in the future no mother, grandmother, \n     or other family member will ever again be told that the law \n     is blind to the loss of a child who is unborn but already \n     living and loved.\n\n  I ask my colleagues to listen again to Ashley's words to her child \nLandon--both victims, both were murdered:\n\n       You are the child I have always dreamed about. I know it \n     will be a long time before I meet you, but I can't wait to \n     hold you for the first time. I love you more every day. \n     Always, Mommy.\n\n  I ask my colleagues, is there one victim, or are there two? Is it one \nvictim or two when Ashley and Landon were murdered?\n  I have another case--unfortunately, there are too many of these \ncases--that demonstrates why this law needs to be dealt with. Here is a \npicture of Tracy Marciniak holding her son Zachariah 12 years ago. This \nis a case from Wisconsin.\n  We all have precious baby photos. I have five children, and I love \neach of them and have precious photos. This should be a happy baby \nphoto, but if you look closely, you will see it is not. You can see it \nby the look on Tracy's case, by the coffin behind her, and by the \nfuneral flowers. Tracy's son Zachariah is dead and she, Tracy, \nsurvived, and is here today. If people would like to visit with her, \nshe is in the lobby.\n  In 1992, in Wisconsin, Tracy was terribly beaten. She lived and her \nson Zachariah died. I have spoken with Tracy, and I have heard how the \nloss of Zachariah hurts her to this very day. Regrettably, justice was \nnot served. Was Tracy and Zachariah's assailant charged with the murder \nof Zachariah? No. In Wisconsin, law enforcement authorities told \nTracy's family they could only charge the attacker with assault; in the \neyes of the law, no one died.\n  What is more, Tracy's attacker says he would not have attacked her if \nhe could have been charged with murder. Let me state that again: If \nTracy's attacker had known he could have been charged with murder, he \nwould not have attacked her.\n  I would like to read a portion of Tracy's July 8, 2003, testimony in \nfront of the House Judiciary subcommittee, where she has spoken about \nthis case before. This is Tracy Marciniak's statement:\n\n       I respectfully ask that the members of the subcommittee \n     examine the photograph that you see before you. In this \n     photo, I am holding the body of my son, Zachariah Nathaniel.\n       Often, when people see the photo for the first time, it \n     takes a moment for them to realize that Zachariah is not \n     peacefully sleeping. Zachariah was dead in this photograph. \n     This photo was taken at Zachariah's funeral.\n       I carried Zachariah in my womb for almost nine full months. \n     He was killed in my womb only five days from his delivery \n     date. The first time I ever held him in my arms, he was \n     already dead. This photo shows the second time I held \n     him--it was the last time.\n       There is no way I could really tell you about the pain I \n     feel when I visit my son's grave site in Milwaukee, and at \n     other times, thinking of all we missed together. But that \n     pain was greater because the man who killed Zachariah got \n     away with murder.\n       I know that some lawmakers in some groups insist there is \n     no such thing as an unborn victim, and that crimes like this \n     have only a single victim--but that is callous and it is \n     wrong. Please don't tell me that my son was not a real victim \n     of a real crime. We were both victims, but only I survived.\n       Zachariah's delivery date was to be February 13, 1992. But \n     on the night of February 8, my own husband brutally attacked \n     me in my home in Milwaukee. He held me against a couch by my \n     hair. He knew that I very much wanted my son. He punched me \n     very hard, twice, in the abdomen. Then he refused to call for \n     help, and prevented me from calling.\n       After about 15 minutes of my screaming in pain that I \n     needed help, he finally went to a bar and from there called \n     for help. I and Zachariah were rushed by ambulance to the \n     hospital, where Zachariah was delivered by emergency \n     Caesarean section. My son was dead. The physicians said he \n     had bled to death inside me because of blunt-force trauma.\n       My own injuries were life-threatening. I nearly died. I \n     spent three weeks in the hospital. During the time I was \n     struggling to survive, the legal authorities came and they \n     spoke to my sister. They told her something that she found \n     incredible. They told her that in the eyes of Wisconsin law, \n     nobody had died on the night of February 8.\n       Later this information was passed on to me. I was told that \n     in the eyes of the law, no murder had occurred. I was \n     devastated.\n       My life already seemed destroyed by the loss of my son. But \n     there was so much additional pain because the law was blind \n     to what had really happened. The law, which I had been raised \n     to believe was based on justice, was telling me that \n     Zachariah had not really been murdered.\n       Before his trial, my attacker said on a TV program that he \n     would never have hit me if he had thought he could be charged \n     with killing an unborn baby.\n       My family and I looked for somebody who would help us \n     reform the law so that no such injustice would occur in our \n     state in the future. We found only one group that was willing \n     to help, Wisconsin Right to Life. They never asked me my \n     opinion on abortion or on any other issue. They simply worked \n     with me, and other surviving family members of unborn \n     victims, to reform the law.\n       It took years. Again and again I told my story to state \n     lawmakers and pleaded with them, as I now plead with you, to \n     correct this injustice in our criminal justice system.\n       Finally, on June 16, 1998, Governor Tommy Thompson signed \n     the fetal homicide law. This means it will never again be \n     necessary for state authorities in Wisconsin to tell a \n     grieving mother, who has lost her baby, that nobody really \n     died. Under this law, an unborn child is recognized as a \n     legal crime victim, just like any other member of the human \n     race.\n       Of course, the state still has to prove anything beyond a \n     reasonable doubt to a jury, which is as it should be. But \n     when this bill was under consideration in the legislature, it \n     was actually shown to some of the former jury members in our \n     case, and they said if that had been the law at the time I \n     was attacked, they would have had no problem convicting my \n     attacker under it.\n\n  Next, I present a statement from Ms. Shiwona Pace of Arkansas. Ms. \nPace suffered a horrible tragedy. She was severely beaten by several \nattackers, and as a direct result, her baby, whom she had named Heaven, \ndied. Fortunately, Arkansas passed an unborn victims of violence law \nprior to the crime committed by Ms. Pace's assailants. Under the \nFeinstein amendment, Ms. Pace's assailants would not have even \ncommitted a crime, other than assault. Please listen to her plea to \nlegislators.\n\n       My name is Shiwona Pace. On August 26, 1999, I was a 23-\n     year-old college student in Little Rock. I was the mother of \n     two--my five-year-old son, and an unborn baby girl named \n     Heaven Lashay.\n       August 26 was one day before my predicted full-term \n     delivery date. But that night, three men brutally murdered my \n     unborn baby daughter. I curled up face down on the floor, \n     crying, begging for them to stop beating me. But they did not \n     stop. One shouted, ``F*** you! Your baby is dying tonight!''\n       They choked me, punched me, hit me in the face with a gun. \n     They kicked me again and again in the abdomen. After about \n     thirty minutes, they left me sobbing there on the floor. At \n     the hospital, they found that Heaven had died in my womb. She \n     was a perfect baby, almost seven pounds.\n       The assailants were arrested. They had been hired by Erik \n     Bullock, my former boyfriend. He paid them $400 to kill \n     little Heaven Lashay.\n       Only a month before, a new state law took effect that \n     recognized unborn children as crime victims. If that law had \n     not been enacted, Erik Bullock would have been prosecuted \n     only for the assault on me, but not for the death of my baby.\n       But thanks to the state law, Bullock was also convicted for \n     his role in killing my baby. The men who attacked me are also \n     being prosecuted for what they did to Heaven.\n       I tell my story now for one reason: If this same attack \n     occurred today within a federal jurisdiction, the men who \n     killed my baby would be prosecuted only for assault. That is \n     why I urge members of Congress to support the Unborn Victims \n     of Violence Act, which would recognize unborn children as \n     victims under 68 federal laws dealing with crimes of \n     violence.\n       I was dismayed to learn that some members of Congress \n     oppose this bill, and insist on adoption of a radically \n     different [version] that says that such crimes only have one \n     victim--the pregnant women.\n       This is not the same as what would happen under the \n     Feinstein amendment. They are\n\n[[Page S3144]]\n\n     wrong. On the night of August 26, 1999, there were two \n     victims. I lived--but my daughter died. I lost a child, and \n     my son lost the baby sister he had always wanted--but little \n     Heaven lost her life.\n       It seems to me that any congressman who votes for the \n     ``one-victim'' amendment is really saying that nobody died \n     that night. And that is a lie.\n\n  Then we have the well-known case of Laci and Conner Peterson in \nCalifornia that has been spoken of previously. This is a statement from \nSharon Rocha, Laci Peterson's mother, and Conner Peterson's \ngrandmother. She has spoken out often on this issue. This is a \nCalifornia case that is well known and has probably done as much to \nbring this up today on this floor as anything else we have examined.\n  This is from Sharon Rocha's statement. I will read a portion of it:\n\n       As you know, Laci and Conner were cruelly murdered. In this \n     difficult time, my family is grateful that under California \n     law the murders of Laci and Conner can both be prosecuted. \n     But for the families of many other murder victims across the \n     country, there can be no such comfort. Federal law does not \n     recognize that these crimes have two victims.\n\n\n  So California law does recognize it.\n\n       When I became aware that Congresswoman Melissa Hart was \n     working on a bill to correct this problem, I contacted her to \n     express my support. I asked her to name it ``Laci and \n     Conner's Law'' in memory of my daughter and grandson. I am \n     grateful to Congresswoman Hart, the House leadership, and the \n     many congressmen, both Republicans and Democrats, who have \n     agreed to support this common-sense legislation. I thank \n     President Bush for his willingness to sign it into law.\n\n       The House of Representatives has shown their support for \n     this law by approving it twice thus far, but the Senate has \n     consistently failed to act. I call on every Senator to vote \n     for this bill, so that the law will do justice for families \n     of murder victims--families like mine. It is time for the \n     Senate to stand up for innocent victims like Conner.\n\n  These are real stories. They are tough stories. But they speak to the \nsituation in this country today. This type of crime happens all too \nfrequently. Unfortunately, there are more cases that we could mention.\n  I wanted to put a real face on this issue for my colleagues, and to \nask them this simple question when they vote on the Feinstein \nsubstitute: How many victims are there? Is it one victim, or are there \ntwo? That is the real decision in regard to this amendment.\n  I urge a vote against the Feinstein amendment.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas yields the floor.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, it is extraordinarily difficult to \nrespond to the litany of atrocities the Senator from Kansas has just \nenumerated. I cannot help but wonder: What kind of animal can do this \nto a woman who is 7 or 8 or 9 months pregnant? I cannot help but wonder \nhow our society produces men who would do this kind of thing to a \nwoman. I cannot help, as a mother and a grandmother, to share with \nthose for whom this is a life scar that will never, never heal.\n  And I understand it. I understand the need to want to punish, and \nunderstand the need to want to say this child--who is so close to \nbirth, who would be capable of life outside of the womb at that \nmoment--is a victim because, in fact, that child is a victim. I \nappreciate that and I understand it.\n  One of the reasons at the beginning of my remarks I said this bill is \nso controversial is because definitions have different meanings in law. \nThe controversial part in the underlying bill is the definition of \n``child in utero'' and ``child, who is in utero'' because the bill \nlanguage is: ``means a member of the species homo sapiens,'' in other \nwords, a person, ``at any stage of development''--``any stage of \ndevelopment,'' not when the fetus is what they call ``quick,'' which \nmeans it is capable of movement; not when it is viable, which means it \nis capable of life outside the womb; but at ``any stage of \ndevelopment.''\n  This is what causes the problem in the law once you set it in the \nlaw. That is what is so distressing about this bill. Because every \nMember of this Senate wants to vote yes. Every Member of this Senate \nwants to say: Throw the book at that animal. Who could be so callous? \nWho could be without any morality? Who could be so cruel? Who could \npractice such a heinous crime? Who could punch a 9-month pregnant woman \nin the stomach to the extent that it causes the killing of her unborn \nchild?\n  So I am there. I am there entirely. I am there completely. But, \nagain, it is complicated because the definition we are working from \ngives rights at the point of conception. It does not differentiate. It \ndoes not say the 8-month-old baby or the 7-month-old baby, who is \ncapable of life today, is what we are talking about. It says the \nrecently fertilized egg is what we are talking about. That is the \ndifference.\n  It is so hard, because you stand here and you listen and your heart \ngoes out, and you think of these beautiful women and their beautiful \nchildren, and some animal comes at them, and in some cases kills them \nboth, in some cases kills one, and in some cases kills the other. Sure, \nthrow the book at him.\n  I will go a step further. I would give them a death penalty because \nthey have taken two lives, and I do believe a child at that period of \ngestation is a life.\n  The problem is the bill language, which begins this at the point of \nconception.\n  Now, every single case presented on this Senate floor this morning is \nof a child who is viable outside of the womb. But the bill covers \nchildren that are not children; that are a day old in the womb, that \nare at conception. That is the problem we have with this bill. Because \nonce you give an embryo, at the point of conception, all of the legal \nrights of a human being, and you have said that embryo, then, if it is \nlost to humankind, is murdered, you have created the legal case to go \nagainst Roe v. Wade in Federal law for the first time in history.\n  Now, California and the Laci Peterson case was mentioned a great \ndeal. The prosecution of Scott Peterson will be conducted under \nCalifornia law, which has amended the definition of the penal code \nsection 187--which is first degree murder--to refer to a fetus. But \nthen other parts of law in California only imposes criminal liability \nstarting at 7 to 8 weeks of gestation. So where the California law \neffectively covers exactly the situation that the Senator from Kansas \nis mentioning--all of those situations--it takes into consideration the \nperiod prior to 7 to 8 weeks of gestation.\n  And, in fact, many other State laws do as well.\n  The problem is this is a much more comprehensive definition that \ndoesn't make any of the distinctions that are made by many of the \nStates with respect to these criminal statutes. Many of them cover when \nthe fetus has quickened, which means the fetus or the child is capable \nof movement, and many of them cover after viability.\n  This creates the situation where the embryo has the rights of a \nperson. That is the problem for many of us.\n  The Senator from Ohio--and I think he knows I respect him; we have \nworked on so many things--says don't bring in the abortion debate. But \nI can't help but bring in the abortion debate because the proponents--\nnot the Senator from Ohio, but other proponents--have said ``this is \npart of our strategy--this is what we want to achieve.''\n  Then you get somebody like me and Senator Boxer and other cosponsors \nwho want to protect a woman's right to control her own reproductive \nsystem, particularly in those early months, who read this bill and see \nthe definition and say: ``There is the ball game--here we lose big \ntime.''\n  It is like you say to me, ``gotcha,'' because I want to punish that \nguy who beat that woman to death, who killed her unborn child, because \nI know that child is capable of life. You know that child is capable of \nlife. But to give that right to a fertilized egg or an embryo is a \ndifferent thing. Your bill gives that right to a fertilized egg or an \nembryo or a zygote.\n  Then, when I go out and I look at what people have said about the \nbill, I see these statements, such as the statement of Mr. Casey:\n\n       In as many areas as we can, we want to put on the books \n     that the embryo is a person.\n\n  This bill puts on the books that an embryo is a person, a member of \nthe species Homo sapiens, in bill language. This bill establishes \nexactly what the right-to-life movement wants to establish, that an \nembryo is a person. That\n\n[[Page S3145]]\n\nsets the stage for a jurist to acknowledge that human beings at any \nstage of development deserve protection. Once you have the embryo being \na human being, then that human being at any stage of development \ndeserves protection--meaning deserves rights under the law, which this \nestablishes because it makes that embryo a victim--even protection that \nwould trump a woman's interest in terminating a pregnancy. Think of \nthat, that would trump a woman's interest in terminating a pregnancy.\n  Now, I am one who believes there should not be abortion if the baby \nis viable. I agree with Roe because it provides the woman choice in the \nfirst 3 months of a pregnancy where there is not viability. I lived and \ngrew up at a time when abortion was illegal in California. I saw a good \nfriend commit suicide because she was pregnant and in college. I saw \nwomen pass the plate so someone could go to Tijuana for an illegal \nabortion. You would say that is not relevant to this debate--``don't \ndiscuss it; don't bring it up in the Senate--just think about the \nmothers and the babies who were killed.''\n  I want to do that, too. And I think about the mothers and the babies. \nI want to throw the book at those guys. And the death penalty, too. I \ndon't have a problem with that because I believe by your actions, you \ncan vitiate your own right to live. That has been true for me since \n1971, as well. That has been my consistent position.\n  But once in a statute you create a fertilized egg as a human being \nwith specific rights, the march to eliminate Roe v. Wade is on its way \nin statute. That is what is happening with this bill. That is what I \nobject to. There is no reference to viability.\n  I have the list of what all the States do. They all do different \nthings. Many of them recognize it. For example, seven States impose \ncriminal liability starting when a fetus is quick, in other words, \ncapable of movement: Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, Nevada, Oklahoma, \nRhode Island, Washington. Seven States impose criminal liability \nstarting at the point of viability: Florida, Indiana, Massachusetts, \nMissouri, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee. So there are many \ndifferences. Different States do different things, even when they have \nthis law.\n  But what this does, what this underlying bill does, is say from the \nmoment of conception there is a baby and that baby is a human being and \nthat baby has rights.\n  That is a problem in the criminal law. As the Stanford law professor \npointed out, if a case comes before the court where, let's say, a woman \nwas assaulted and she was 3 days pregnant, and the forensics could \nestablish that she was 3 days pregnant, and you are voir-diring people \nfor a jury and you are telling them that there is a second victim, and \nit is a fertilized egg that is 3 days old and there is a 20-year charge \npending or life imprisonment pending for that 3- or 5-day-old \nfertilized egg, then this is what the law professor meant when he said: \n``You are going to get the very people who are the most interested in \nprotecting the woman being reluctant to go on that jury.''\n  Not every case under this law is going to be post-viability, going to \nbe like the cases that the Senator from Kansas brought forward, where I \nwould say: ``Give the guy the death penalty.'' I wouldn't have a \nproblem with that. They did terrible things, the acts of an animal. But \nthat is not what this law says. That is the difference.\n  What we have tried to do is say: If you end a pregnancy, if you harm \na pregnancy, the same penalties would apply that apply in the House \nbill and Senator DeWine's bill.\n  I wish this could have gone to the Judiciary. I wish it wasn't rule \nXIV. I wish I had an opportunity in committee, in markup, to make these \npoints.\n  Let me go over once again, so that everybody is crystal clear on the \npoint of the creation of a separate offense, where a defendant violates \nany of the enumerated Federal crimes, our bills are identical. On the \nprovision that the separate offense is punished the same as the \nviolation of the enumerated Federal crimes, our bill is identical. On \nthe provision that if the separate offense harms or ends the pregnancy, \nthe punishment is the same as a violation would be for the underlying \ncrime: murder, manslaughter, or assault, as appropriate. Our bills are \nidentical.\n  With respect to the provision of penalty for death of a fetus is a \nmaximum life sentence, our bills are identical. With respect to the \nprovision of penalty for harm to the fetus is a maximum 20-year \nsentence, our bills are identical. And both bills do not impose the \ndeath penalty. Where our bills are different--and this is important--is \nthe definition of when life begins.\n  The underlying bill defines life as beginning at conception.\n  (Mr. ALEXANDER assumed the Chair.)\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, we do not address when life begins. I \njust read Justice Blackmun's opinion in Roe v. Wade. It is interesting, \nbecause he goes back to the Stoics, the Catholic Church, to the Middle \nAges, and discusses the difference of opinion of when life begins, the \ndifference of opinions in science. Then he reaches his conclusion that \nbecause these differences are so vast, the law generally does not \ndirectly enjoin that point of when life begins.\n  That is the problem we have here. That is the dilemma the Senate \nfaces. This bill is on a fast track. This bill has passed the House. \nThis bill has been subject to a Rule XIV, without a hearing, from the \nyear 2000. You have heard the most poignant, disturbing, heartrending \nstories on this floor. I respond to them like everybody else does. But \nI also know if you give a fertilized egg rights in the Federal law, it \nis going to have repercussions downline. If you declare in this bill \nyou can prove a 1-day-old fertilized egg was a victim and therefore \nmurdered, how do you turn around and say in another law you can proceed \nwith embryonic stem cell research? You have the same 1-day-old \nfertilized egg. If it is murder here, is it not murder there? What are \nthe repercussions of doing that? They are enormous.\n  The other side doesn't talk about this. They talk about women who are \n7 or 8 or 9 months pregnant. They talk about the most heinous and \nbrutal assaults. But the bill does much more. The bill says a 1-day-old \nfertilized egg is a member of the species Homo sapiens. Translation: It \nis a person. Translation: It is a human being.\n  That is the problem, and this Senate, before it passes out this bill, \nshould understand it and should understand there is an alternative, and \nthe alternative aims to impose the same penalties, but doesn't create \nthat victim fertilized egg, 1 day old--by nobody's stretch a human \nbeing--possible of becoming a human being, but not a human being. I \nhave live cells, but they are not capable of producing life.\n  But once the child, the fetus in the womb, is capable of living, that \nis a different story. I am the first one to admit that is a different \nstory. But everything in this bill, the underlying bill, goes back to \nthe basic definition of what is being done here, and that is that \npersonhood, life, is being given to a 1-day-old fertilized egg.\n  Now I have one child biologically, I have three stepdaughters, and I \nhave five grandchildren. I have seen close friends--I know the glory of \nmotherhood. I know the catastrophe that takes place when you lose a \nchild. I have had miscarriages, so I understand that. But then there is \nthe march to turn back the clock to when I was in college and abortion \nwas illegal. Then after college, when I went out into the world, I \nactually sentenced women convicted of abortion in the State of \nCalifornia in the State prison. I saw the terrible morbidity and the \nterrible things they did illegally in back-alley abortions. At that \npoint, I said this is so terrible. Then Roe v. Wade passed in 1973, and \na woman could control her own reproductive system, particularly in that \nfirst trimester. I thought to myself, we should never go back to the \nway it was.\n  My concern about the underlying bill is it is the first bridge to \ntake us back to the way it was because of the definition that is in \nthis bill, which gives human rights to a 1-day-old fertilized egg in \nutero. That is the problem for me. That is the problem for a lot of us \nin the Senate. Whether it will be enough, I don't know.\n  I tried to perfect the bill. Remember, this was a rule XIV. We didn't \nhave a chance to mark it up. I tried to perfect it. Unfortunately, I \nwas not granted the usual privilege of being able to send a modified \namendment to the\n\n[[Page S3146]]\n\ndesk. But the intent is clear. I have made it crystal clear in my \nremarks. We will have the same penalties for the same crimes as the \nunderlying bill. We will avoid one thing, and that is determining when \nlife, for the purpose of law, actually begins.\n\n  I yield the floor. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 23 minutes 40 seconds.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. In a moment, I will yield to my colleague from South \nCarolina.\n  Mr. President, before I yield to my colleague, I want to respond very \nbriefly to my colleague and friend from California in regard, again, to \nthe question of abortion. My colleague is concerned--I understand her \nsincerity because she has expressed it many times on the Senate floor. \nI don't doubt that sincerity at all--that somehow this bill sets a \nprecedent regarding abortion.\n  First of all, we all know statutes cannot overcome the Supreme Court \ndecisions, constitutional law. We should not be concerned about what \nthe statute will do. We particularly should not be concerned when we \nknow many of the States have statutes very similar to what we propose \nto enact today. In fact, several of the States have had these statutes \nin place for up to 30 years. They have not in any way changed or \ninfringed on abortion rights. Whatever one might think of abortion \nrights, these have not affected them and this bill will not affect \nthem. To make sure of that, we put provisions in this statute, which I \nhave read on the floor today, which make it crystal clear they will not \nin any way affect that. So we have precedent.\n  We have the fact that statutes cannot interfere with constitutional \nlaw, plus we have precedent of many years of experience of State laws \nnot interfering with abortion rights. So there is just no reason for \nanybody, when they come to the floor to vote on this, to think this is \nin any way going to affect abortion rights at all.\n  My friend has talked about the fact that we follow what I believe 16 \nStates have done when we begin to protect the unborn. Some States \ndefine it differently. My colleague has cited what California and some \nStates do. They are defined differently. But we follow in this statute \nwhat some others States have done.\n  In our proposed statute, we use this language, and I would say it is \nnot what my colleague, with all respect, has said. This is what the \nlanguage is:\n\n     . . . who is carried in the womb.\n\n  ``Who is carried in the womb,'' that is the language, the precise \nterm that is used, ``carried in the womb.''\n  As a practical matter, since this is a criminal statute, we all know \nthat to prosecute under this statute, a prosecutor would have to prove \nbeyond a reasonable doubt, to prosecute under this law, that there was \nthis unborn child. They would have to prove the existence of the child. \nAnd then they would have to prove there was death or injury to the \nchild beyond a reasonable doubt. They have to prove the existence, \nfirst of all, beyond a reasonable doubt, and then they have to prove \nthe death or injury beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  It is not, with all due respect, a question of at the moment of \nconception that this protection, as a practical matter, would kick in. \nFirst, it has to be carried in the womb; second, you would have to be \nable to prove the existence and then prove there was injury or prove \nthere was death. That is the practical application of the statute we \npropose to pass.\n  I yield to my friend and colleague from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eleven minutes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Will the Chair notify me when I have \nused 4 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, I wish to speak to how \nthe bill was drafted and why.\n  Senator DeWine articulated it well. You have to prove the pregnancy, \nand we defined the pregnancy like 16 other States. That is the dominant \nway of defining the child for the purpose of this statute. Thirteen \nStates have a different view of it. In California, I think the law is \nat 6 weeks. If you can prove the child is beyond 6 weeks--not viable \nbut beyond 6 weeks--the law kicks in.\n  In 1999, when we first drafted this statute--Senator DeWine was \ncarrying it in the Senate, I carried it in the House, and we are \nfinally coming together to have a vote--it never made sense to me, if \nyou believe this is not about abortion--because it is not; we wrote it \nso it is not--why would you give a criminal a break who destroyed a \nfamily's life in two ways, not one?\n  You are not going to prosecute medical researchers under this \nstatute. You have to hurt the mother. This is not about medical \nresearch. It is not about abortion. It is about criminals who attack \npregnant women.\n  Why would you give the criminal a break at 3 weeks? You could prove \nthe baby has been around for 3 weeks. The criminal just totally gets \naway with it.\n  The Feinstein amendment--as much as I like Senator Feinstein, and she \nis truly one of my favorites--nobody goes this way because this is not \nthe way you would want to go if you are prosecuting criminals. You do \nnot want to ignore the reality of what happened to this family and to \nthese victims. This is not about abortion. If it was abortion law, you \nwould not have any prosecutions except until the late terms of the \nabortion. Why would you let a criminal do that? This is not about a \nmother's right to choose. Under the statute, you cannot prosecute the \nwoman at any time. You cannot do anything about abortion rights because \nthe statute protects lawful abortions.\n\n  For 30-something years in California, they had the ability to \nprosecute criminals who attacked pregnant women and have Roe v. Wade \nrights. Look in the phonebook anyplace in California and you will find \npeople who will provide a lawful abortion. Look at the criminal law and \nyou will find a statute that allows people to be put in jail who attack \na pregnant woman and do damage to her unborn child at the 6-week \nperiod.\n  My point is, when criminals attack pregnant women, don't play this \ngame of the abortion debate. Don't bring it over here. The reason we \nvoted 417 to 0 in the House was to prevent an execution of a pregnant \nwoman at the earliest stages of pregnancy. It does no good to kill the \nchance of that child to grow to render justice to the mother.\n  With a vote of 417 to 0, the House adopted the same definition as \nthis statute because the purpose of that statute was to prevent the \nState from executing a woman who we know to be pregnant at the early \nstages of a pregnancy. The reason being, it does no good. It does not \nadvance Roe v. Wade. It just does something you do not need to do to \nrender justice. You do need the ability to bring two prosecutions at \nthe earliest stages of pregnancy to render justice for those who choose \nto violently assault pregnant women. No medical researcher is going to \nbe harmed. We will have the stem cell debate. The Roe v. Wade rights \nthat exist today are not going to be eroded. They have existed in \nconjunction with these statutes for years and years, and that debate \nwill go on for years and years. But here is what is likely to happen.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 4 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. There will be, unfortunately, human \nnature being what it is, another assault against a pregnant woman where \nFederal jurisdiction would exist if we have this statute. It is going \nto happen because people are mean, people are cruel, and they need to \nbe dealt with when they are mean and cruel.\n  The Senate enhancement option has been rejected by everybody who \nlooked at this because it does not render justice. It creates a legal \nfiction that is not necessary and destroys the whole purpose of this \nstatute.\n  I mentioned the Arkansas case. Three teenagers were prosecuted for \nbeating up a pregnant woman for the purpose of making sure one of them \ndid not have to pay child support. They are not on death row. I \nmisspoke. One of them received 40 years, one received life \nimprisonment. It was a capital statute, but it was not a death penalty \ncase. I was wrong. I apologize.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator used 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Five more seconds.\n\n[[Page S3147]]\n\n  The Laci Peterson case is a death penalty case because there are two \nvictims.\n  All we are saying is Federal law should address reality. When Michael \nLenz lost his wife in the Oklahoma City bombing incident, he also lost \nhis son, Michael Lenz III. All I am asking for is that justice be \nrendered in cases such as that. When somebody chooses to destroy a \nfamily--the mother and the unborn child--let them pay a severe price, \nand let's debate abortion another day, another time, and not interject \nit into a statute where it should not be interjected.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, could you give us the time remaining \non both sides, please?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes. The Senator from California has 23 \nminutes remaining. The other side has 5 minutes remaining.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, this is a difficult \ndiscussion because I am very fond of both the Senators with whom I am \ndebating. However, I certainly do not agree with the statement the \nSenator from Ohio just made with respect to the definition that is in \nthe bill.\n  I will read the definition that is in the bill. The term ``a child \nwho is in utero'' means:\n\n       A member of the species Homo sapiens at any stage of \n     development who is carried in the womb.\n\n  The one thing neither Senator DeWine nor I know is how fast the egg \ngets to the womb, but I think it is pretty fast.\n  I just had a note passed to me by someone more erudite than I. I \nthink we can all put this in our lexicon.\n  It takes about 7 days for a fertilized egg to get to the womb, but \nthere is also the belief the underlying bill applies at the moment of \nconception. Let us say the egg gets to the womb in 7 days. The problem \nthose of us on this side of the aisle have with the bill is it gives \nthe status of a human being to that egg as soon as it is in the womb, \nand that creates for the first time in Federal criminal law a scenario \nwhereby if that egg is hurt, criminal assault charges, criminal \nmanslaughter charges, criminal murder charges can be brought because \nthat egg, at any stage of development--they do not use trimesters, they \ndo not use any way of deciding the development--at any stage of \ndevelopment, that egg in utero is a member of the species Homo sapiens, \nand that is where this, for criminal purposes, becomes so difficult.\n  That is why the letter from the professor from Stanford, who runs the \ncriminal prosecution unit at Stanford Law School, becomes so relevant, \nbecause let's say I am in a jury pool and a woman has been beaten up \nand she was 7 days pregnant--at that moment it is a fertilized egg--and \nshe lost the fertilized egg, and I was told the penalty would be an \nadditional 10 years in prison because she lost that egg. Well, I would \nhave to make a decision as to whether I want to be on that jury. So \nwhat the professor says is this can actually work contrary to our \nintent, particularly in these early cases.\n  He also said he suspects it is dependent on the administration as to \nwhether early cases will be brought to a court or not, but the point is \nwe cannot make that decision. We cannot say this is only going to be \nused when a mother is 7 months, 8 months, or 9 months, pregnant. In the \nhorrific circumstances described by the Senator from Kansas, which got \nall of our hearts beating faster, we cannot assume that all cases will \nbe of that type. The legislation clearly says for the purposes of \ndefinition the child is defined from the point it is in the womb at any \nstage of development as a child, as a person, with rights. That is the \ndilemma and that is why we have tried to craft a bill that does not do \nthat, that says if someone harms or ends a pregnancy, they are subject \nto the same penalties.\n  This body is going to have to decide--and it is a very hard question. \nI think this is one of the most controversial bills we have had. This \nis probably why this bill has been around for 5 years now. I think it \nhad a hearing in Judiciary in 2000. It has not had a hearing since. It \nhas been rule XIVed to the floor.\n  Again, I wanted to make some small changes--I was not permitted to do \nso--by modifying my amendment. I believe, and my chief counsel \nbelieves, this bill provides the same penalties. The one difference is \nthe definition is different. We use harm or end pregnancy, rather than \nthat the unborn child becomes a child--well, that a child in utero and \nchild who is in utero means a member of the species Homo sapiens, at \nany stage of development, who is carried in the womb. That is the \nproblem and that is where for those of us who want to protect a woman's \nright to choose and who read the statements that are put out by the far \nright, we take them at their word that this is where they are going.\n\n  I did not make this up. This is a rather well-known statement. It \nclearly says, ``In as many areas as we can, we went to put on the \nbooks,''--this statute on the books--``that the embryo is a person . . \n. ''\n  For me, I am also very interested in being able to see that there are \nprudent regulations and Federal controls that will allow embryonic stem \ncell research. Well, if it is murder of a 7-day-old fertilized egg, \nthen it is murder if it is used in stem cell research as well. That is \nwhere I think this is going.\n  There are also statements by people who want to ban embryonic stem \ncell research that also say this is the strategy. So I say, why get \ninto it at all? Why not just say, if someone ends or terminates a \npregnancy, the same penalties will apply. That is what we have tried to \ndo. That is the intent of what we are doing.\n  I think the votes are very close. At this point, I will yield the \nfloor, but I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes.\n  Mr. DeWINE. And the Senator from California?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifteen minutes.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I suggest the absence of a quorum, with the time to run \nequally on both sides.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeWINE. We are getting close to the end of this debate. I think \nthere are just a few points about this amendment I would again like to \nstress. One is this whole debate today has nothing at all to do with \nabortion. I talked about that. I will not belabor the point. We have \nmade that clear in the language we have written. It is set down in the \nprecedent of States that have passed similar legislation. It has not \nhad anything to do with abortion.\n  If Members of the Senate truly believe what the vast majority of the \nAmerican people believe, and that is there are two victims, then they \nhave to turn down the well-intended Feinstein amendment. The Feinstein \namendment tries to provide for enhanced penalties. I believe it is \nclear, from what I have spelled out a few moments ago, she has failed \nto do that, that there are no enhanced penalties. Even if there were, \nit is a contortion of the law and logic to deny the fact that when a \npregnant woman is violently attacked and she loses her child, for the \nlaw to say we refuse to recognize there is a second victim, and that is \nwhat the Feinstein amendment, unfortunately, says. The Feinstein \namendment denies the fact there is a second victim.\n\n  We have heard on the Senate floor today, time and time again, these \nhorrible stories that Senator Feinstein and I--our hearts go out to \nthese victims. Everyone's heart does. But how can we say to these \nfamilies that these children who were lost, sometimes the grandchildren \nwho were lost, were really not, in the eyes of the law, victims?\n  In the eyes of everyone else in society they are victims. Shouldn't \nthe law also recognize them as victims? That is what we are saying with \nour bill. Unfortunately, the Feinstein amendment denies them that.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is debating this \nsensible measure, and I certainly hope that the outcome will be the \nrejection\n\n[[Page S3148]]\n\nof the two amendments and passage of the underlying bill. Such an \noutcome will lead immediately to the enactment of the Unborn Victims of \nViolence Act, as the legislation has already passed the House and the \nPresident has stated that he will sign it.\n  The Unborn Victims of Violence Act would recognize an unborn child as \na victim when he or she is killed or injured during the commission of a \nFederal or military crime. The gist of this debate is the question of \nwhether there are one victim or two in such instances. Polling suggests \nthat upwards of 80 percent of the American people believe that there \nare two victims, a view no doubt reinforced by the well-known case of \nLaci and Connor Peterson. It has been noted that when definitive \nevidence of foul play in that case came to light, two bodies washed up \non the shore, not one. The Unborn Victims of Violence Act would codify \nthat common sense observation in Federal law.\n  Opponents of the bill contend that the bill's ``two victims'' premise \nis ``unprecedented,'' but 29 State laws--including the law in \nCalifornia, where Laci and Connor Peterson were killed--relfect that \nexact understanding of what merits punishment when a violent crime is \ncommitted against a woman and her unborn child. It is the ``one \nvictim'' idea the Feinstein amendment would inscribe in law that would \ndepart form the understanding embedded in the State laws addressing \nthis question.\n  Finally, I sincerely hope that my colleagues--whatever their views on \nthe question of one victim versus two victims--will firmly reject the \namendment offered by the senior Senator from Washington State. I am \nvery proud of my record of support for victims of domestic violence, \nand I believe that some of the ideas contained in the Murray amendment \nmerit our consideration.\n  But passing the amendment we are presented with today would be a \nserious mistake. First, I must note that the Murray amendment was \nobviously drafted in haste because it contains serious technical \nflaws--not the least of which is a provision that would--as I \nunderstand it--give an abusive family member the same rights as a \nvictim!\n  The Murray amendment would create an unpaid leave provision that is \ndistinct from the provisions contained in the Family Medical Leave Act, \nFMLA, and State laws. This new leave provision would apply to employers \nwith as few as 15 employees--compared to 50 for FMLA. FMLA applies to \nworkers who have been employed for at least a year, but the proposed \nMurray leave program has no minimum requirements for length of service. \nMoreover, under this amendment, domestic violence leave could be taken \nwithout advance notice, and without corroborating evidence beyond the \nemployee's own sworn statement. Given the extraordinary degree of \nuncertainty such a regime could create for employers, Congress must \nproceed cautiously here. To pass the Murray amendment today would be to \nflout that imperative.\n  I strongly support the unamended version of this bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, acts of violence against women are always \nabhorrent, but they are especially disturbing when committed against \npregnant women. When a violent crime causes injury to a pregnant woman \nthat results in a miscarriage or other damage to the fetus, we all \nshare the desire to ensure that our criminal justice system responds \ndecisively and firmly to exact appropriate punishment. This is not an \nissue on which you will find any disagreement among Members of \nCongress, no matter their party affiliation or whether they are pro-\nchoice or anti-abortion. Protecting pregnant women and their families \nfrom violence is a serious and compelling problem that deserves to be \nelevated above political agendas and partisan politics.\n  Today we consider a bill that proposes a new Federal crime to punish \nconduct that violates a list of over 60 existing federal crimes and \n``causes the death of, or bodily injury to, a child, who is in utero.'' \nThe terms ``a child, who is in utero'' and ``unborn child'' are defined \nin this proposal to be ``a member of the species homo sapiens, at any \nstage of development.'' Through this proposal, we will be forced to \nrevisit the divisive political debate about when human life begins and \nwhat is meant by these terms--whether, for example, the term ``any \nstage of development'' is intended to cover an unfertilized human egg \nor a zygote, and how far away from viability the proposal is designed \nto move the federal definition of a ``person.''\n  Generally, our Federal and State criminal laws only penalize conduct \nthat affects a person who was born alive. That does not mean we cannot \nor should not go further. I support additional punishment if a violent \ncrime against a pregnant woman causes her to miscarry or otherwise \ninjures the fetus. Senator Feinstein will offer an amendment on this \npoint, which I support, and which I will discuss in a moment.\n  While no other Federal criminal statute identifies a fetus as a \ndistinct victim of crime, this does not mean that a fetus is left \nunprotected under our criminal laws. The Justice Department pointed out \nthe obvious, in a letter dated September 9, 1999, to then-Chairman of \nthe House Judiciary Committee, Representative Hyde. That letter states \nthat ``[b]ecause the criminal conduct that would be addressed . . . is \nalready the subject of federal law (since any assault on an `unborn \nchild' cannot occur without an assault on the pregnant woman), [the \nbill] would not provide for the prosecution of any additional \ncriminals.'' As Ronald Weich, a former prosecutor and former Special \nCounsel to the Sentencing Commission, noted in his February 2000 \ntestimony, defendants whose violent attacks against pregnant women \nresulted in harm to a fetus have been prosecuted, and thus ``it is very \nclear that criminal liability may be imposed under current federal \nlaw.''\n  Moreover, the Federal Sentencing Guidelines already provide a \nsentencing enhancement of two levels where the defendant knew or should \nhave known that the victim was a ``vulnerable victim,'' a term that is \ndefined as someone who is unusually vulnerable due to age, or physical \nor mental condition. Guidelines Manual, Sec. 3A1.1(b)(1). This \nprovision has been used to cover violent crimes against pregnant women. \nMr. Weich described several cases in which a pregnant woman was treated \nas a vulnerable victim, resulting in enhancements and upward departures \nin the applicable guideline sentencing ranges for the defendants. \nNevertheless, if there is any question about the application of these \nenhancements in violent crimes against pregnant women, we should \nclarify that matter promptly.\n  Respectfully, it seems to me that this bill has not been crafted to \nfind that common ground, nor designed to provide an effective means to \nprosecute or prevent violence against pregnant women.\n  First, this bill unnecessarily injects the abortion debate into our \nnational struggle against violence towards women. The Supreme Court in \nRoe v. Wade held that ``the word `person', as used in the Fourteenth \nAmendment, does not include the unborn.'' This bill purposely employs \nterms designed to undermine a woman's right to choose by recognizing \nfor the first time in Federal law the legal rights of a person as \napplied to the earliest stages of development of a fetus, an embryo or \nan egg.\n  Second, the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence has warned \nthat a consequence of the bill is that battered women who are \nfinancially or emotionally reliant on the batterer may be less likely \nto seek appropriate medical attention if doing so could result in the \nprosecution of the batterer for an offense as serious as murder. We \nshould pay attention to the experts about the consequences of \nlegislative proposals such as this one, particularly when the experts \nsay this bill could have devastating effects for victims of domestic \nviolence.\n  Finally, the bill ignores the problems of domestic violence, sexual \nassault and other forms of violence against women; in fact, the UVVA \ndoes not even mention the woman. In short, this bill ignores the \nreality that an attack that harms a pregnancy is inherently an attack \non a woman.\n  The senior Senator from California will offer a substitute amendment \nto S. 1019 that does what the Unborn Victims of Violence Act purports \nto do without wading into the political waters of the abortion debate. \nThis amendment,\n\n[[Page S3149]]\n\ncommonly referred to as the Motherhood Protection Act, creates a \nseparate, additional Federal criminal offense for harm to a pregnant \nwoman. Under this legislation, the prosecutor may (1) charge the \ndefendant with an offense against the woman, and (2) subsequently \ncharge the defendant with the separate offense of interrupting--e.g., \ncausing brain damage to the child--or terminating the normal course of \nher pregnancy. A defendant would face a maximum of 20 years in prison \nfor interrupting the pregnancy and a maximum of life imprisonment for \nterminating the pregnancy. Such sentences would be in addition to any \npenalties for the underlying federal crime. These terms of imprisonment \nreflect the same sentences included in the UVVA.\n  Senator Feinstein's amendment addresses harm to a pregnant woman, \nwhile recognizing the loss she suffers through injury to the fetus. By \nexcluding the language in the UVVA that defines a human to include a \nfetus, the Feinstein amendment accomplishes the stated goal of the UVVA \nwithout undermining reproductive rights or ignoring violence against \nwomen.\n  The senior Senator from Washington will offer an amendment in support \nof domestic violence victims, which I am proud to cosponsor. The Murray \namendment would authorize HHS grants to nonprofit agencies to help \nservice providers design and implement intervention programs for \nchildren who witness domestic violence. The grants would encourage \ndomestic violence agencies and schools to work together to address the \nneeds of affected children. The amendment would also establish \nentitlement standards and guidelines for employees to use emergency \nleave to address domestic and sexual violence.\n  Unlike UVVA, these two amendments address the issue of violence \nagainst women. If we are serious about addressing this problem and \ntrying to end the violence, then we should put a stop to the partisan \npolitics surrounding UVVA and vote for these amendments.\n  When it has focused on the real issue of violence against women, \nCongress has taken aggressive action to address the problem of violence \nagainst women. Congress made great strides in the fight against \ndomestic violence by passing the bipartisan Violence Against Women Act \nas a part of the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act. \nSenator Biden and Senator Hatch contributed considerable time and \nleadership to achieve the enactment of VAWA, which marked a turning \npoint in our Nation's effort to address domestic violence and sexual \nassault.\n  This landmark legislation created federal domestic violence offenses \nwith severe penalties to hold offenders accountable for their \ndestructive and criminal acts of violence. Since the end of 1994, the \nDepartment of Justice has brought over 1000 VAWA and VAWA-related \nindictments and awarded over one billion dollars in VAWA grants to \ncommunities working hard to combat violence against women and to help \ncure the pain and suffering that results from it.\n  I am proud to say that Vermont was the first State in the country to \napply for and receive funding under VAWA, and I have seen the way in \nwhich groups such as the Vermont Network Against Domestic Violence and \nSexual Assault have worked effectively to stem violence against women \nand children and to assist those who have suffered from it.\n  I am also pleased that the conference report on the AMBER Alert and \nPROTECT Acts included Leahy-Kennedy-Biden legislation to establish a \ntransitional housing grant program within the Department of Justice to \nprovide victims of domestic violence, stalking, or sexual assault the \nnecessary means to escape the cycle of violence. It amends the Violence \nAgainst Women Act of 1994 to authorize $30 million for each of fiscal \nyears 2004-2008 for the Attorney General to award grants to \norganizations, States, units of local government, and Indian tribes. \nThe grants will help victims of domestic violence, stalking, or sexual \nassault who need transitional housing or related assistance as a result \nof fleeing their abusers, and for whom emergency shelter services or \nother crisis intervention services are unavailable or insufficient. \nPresident Bush signed the conference report into law on May 7, 2003.\n  We know that violence against women pervades all areas of our \ncountry. It makes no difference if you are from a big city or a rural \ntown; domestic violence and other violence against women can be found \nanywhere. This is a serious issue. We owe this country a serious \nresponse, not a debate on ideological proposals that ignore effective \nprograms designed to help women crime victims. I urge my colleagues to \njoin me in supporting the Feinstein and Murray amendments, and in \nvoting against the Unborn Victims of Violence Act.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will oppose H.R. 1997, the Unborn \nVictims of Violence Act, and instead support an alternative offered by \nSenator Feinstein, and I would like to take a moment to explain why.\n  I join with Senator DeWine and the supporters of this bill in \ncondemning acts of violence against women, including pregnant women. \nThe Unborn Victims of Violence Act would make it a Federal crime to \ninjure or kill a fetus during the commission of a Federal crime against \na pregnant woman. This separate offense would be punished as if injury \nor death had occurred to the pregnant woman. I believe that acts of \nviolence against pregnant women are deplorable and should be punished \nseverely. Congress has taken and should continue to take steps to \nprotect women from violence and prosecute those who attack them. But I \nam concerned that by recognizing the fetus as an entity against which a \nseparate crime can be committed, the Unborn Victims of Violence Act may \nundermine women's reproductive rights as set forth by the Supreme Court \nin Roe v. Wade.\n  That is why I plan to support a sound alternative, the Motherhood \nProtection Act, offered by my colleague Senator Feinstein. the \nMotherhood Protection Act would accomplish the same stated goal as the \nUnborn Victims of Violence Act: establishing an additional, separate \nFederal offense for harm to a pregnant woman. It carries the same \npenalties as H.R. 1997: a maximum 20-year sentence for harm to a \npregnancy and a maximum life sentence for termination of a pregnancy.\n  I believe that the Feinstein substitute is the better approach \nbecause it accomplishes the same goal that H.R. 1997 seeks to address \nwithout delving into the controversial issue of defining when human \nlife begins. Regardless of our views on that highly charged question, \nwe can agree that violence against pregnant women is a heinous crime \nand should be punished to the fullest extent of the law. That is why I \nwill oppose H.R. 1997 and instead support the Feinstein substitute.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, how much time does the other side have \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have 1 minute 58 seconds.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I agree that the debate is concluding, \nand I thank the Senator from Ohio. This is a serious subject and it is \na difficult subject and it is a controversial subject. I appreciate the \nmanner in which the debate has been conducted, because I think it has \nbeen conducted in the best tradition of the Senate, with the exception \nof your not letting me modify my amendment. But I will only interpret \nthat as caused by the fact that the other side is worried and doesn't \nwant my amendment to get any better, so they refuse to let me modify \nit.\n  We have two different bills here. I think we have expressed the \ndifferences. The underlying bill does recognize the unborn at any stage \nof development, as long as they are in the womb, as a human being, as a \nvictim and with rights.\n  My bill, rather than enter into where life begins, at what point in \nthis gestation period life actually begins enough to say this is a \nperson with rights--it doesn't get into that. It takes the penalties \nand does a double charge and says if the predicate crime is present, \nand you carry out the crime to harm or end the pregnancy, it is a \ndouble charge so you are charged accordingly.\n  The hard part of this is that we all know there has been a march to \nturn back Roe v. Wade. Every Member of\n\n[[Page S3150]]\n\nthis Senate knows it. We have had vote after vote after vote. Since \n1994, the pro-choice side has lost most of the votes. That is \nirrevocable fact. We know the march is on.\n  So those of us who are pro-choice naturally are going to look at laws \nto see if those laws can constitute, in addition to what they are \nsupposed to do, any kind of bulwark from which to attack Roe.\n  Because of the definition of a child in utero being, at any stage of \ndevelopment, a member of the species Homo sapiens, we come to a \nconclusion. We asked the question, first, why do they use that \ndefinition? So many States have passed laws and many of them have used \ndifferent definitions, why do they select that definition?\n  Answer, because it accomplishes the purpose of determining that once \na fertilized egg is in the womb, it becomes a human being. That, then, \nbuttresses statements such as this one on the easel.\n  This isn't the only statement. I can give another statement by \nanother professor which I used in my opening remarks. It is a statement \nof a Republican strategist. Professor Charo is at the University of \nWisconsin. She made the statement recently:\n\n       If you can get enough of these bricks in place, [meaning \n     laws] draw enough examples from different parts of life and \n     law where embryos are treated as babies, then how can the \n     Supreme Court say they are not? This is, without question, a \n     conscious strategy.\n\n  So if you believe it is without question a conscious strategy--and I, \nbased on the history of how the erosion against Roe is being waged, \npiece by piece, bit by bit, law by law, action by action, I believe it \nis a conscious strategy. The hard part about it for me is that you feel \nthis terrible empathy for women who have been the victims and who are \n7, 8, 9 months pregnant. That has been every case that has been before \nus today, it has reached that stage of gestation, where you know your \nchild can exist outside of the womb and some animal has taken the child \naway from you by beating you to the point where they have killed the \nchild and in many of the same cases--the Senator from Kansas \nillustrated today--killed the mother as well. We want to throw the book \nat that perpetrator. And we do. We believe our bill is clear, and we \nbelieve our bill will stand the test of time.\n  So we ask the Senate to support the substitute amendment and turn \ndown the underlying bill. I reserve the remainder of my time. I yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I will again point out for those who are \nworried about some great precedent being set here in regard to abortion \nthat over half the States have similar laws and many of them are \nabsolutely identical to what we are writing. So people should not be \nconcerned about this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I yield but I am reserving the remainder of my time. \nI may have something to say in a minute or so, and I may not.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I think I have just a short time left. \nHow much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, for those who might have gotten \ninvolved in this late, I would like to use the 5 minutes to say a few \nthings.\n  The first is that this is one of the most difficult areas in which to \nlegislate because it is filled with so much emotion and so much \ndifference of opinion. It is one of those great cultural problems that \nexists out there in our real world, as opposed to this world, where \nhuman lives are very much affected.\n  On the one hand, you have the situation the Senator from Kansas, the \nSenator from Ohio, and the Senator from South Carolina pointed out--\nsituations where you have women who have terrible things done to them. \nIt is just so hard for us to realize how that can happen, that any man \ncan be that callous to beat to death a woman who is 7, 8, or 9 months \npregnant; can use a knife; can cut her fetus when you know that child \nis capable of life.\n  I understand what drives this desire. What drives the desire is to \nsee that there is equal punishment for the taking of that life, which I \nbelieve is a life because it can sustain life. Its pulmonary functions \nhave cleared out in the last few weeks of pregnancy and those kinds of \nthings. But basically it is a baby, and basically it is viable. I \nunderstand all of that.\n  When you get down to definitions, and when you look at the statute \nitself, what concerns many of us and makes us understand we are dealing \nwith something much more than just what I have said is the definition \nof a child in utero who is made by this bill a person, a member of the \nspecies Homo sapiens at any stage of development as long as it is in \nthe womb--that could be 3 days, I am now told, from conception--you are \nnot only creating criminal law for the woman who can produce a child \nwho can live and whose life is taken away but we are creating a \nsanction for an egg that is fertilized that may be 3 days old. That \nsanction can be murder and carry with it the full weight of murdering \nanother human being. It is a very heavy sanction. You are giving rights \nto that newly conceived egg of a full person.\n  There are many of us who say this is another way of doing this. That \nis just saying if you harm or end a pregnancy, these full charges will \nrevert.\n  The reason we do it that way is because it exists all around us. The \nfact that there is a reason for how this child in utero is defined and \nthe reason is, as I have tried to elucidate--and there are many other \ncases--``In as many areas as we can, we want to put on the books that \nthe embryo is a person.''\n  Why do they want to do that? It is simple. They want to do it because \nif we legislate, and the Federal crime is that if a 3-day-old egg is a \nperson and has rights, then abortion under this same context is murder \nor manslaughter or assault. Full rights of a person are given.\n  I think that is a problem when you codify it in statute. This body is \nthen saying: Yes, we agree. Therefore, a case can be brought against \nabortion of any kind at any time and also against embryonic stem-cell \nresearch that some of us believe is the new horizon of medicine, which \nis capable of finding cures for Parkinson's and Alzheimer's, and \njuvenile diabetes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Just to sum up, I hope Members of the Senate will \nvote for the substitute amendment and against the underlying bill.\n  I thank the Chair. I thank the distinguished Senator from Ohio. It \nhas been a very interesting morning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from California. This \nhas been a very good debate. No one in the Senate Chamber cares more \nabout the victims we have been talking about than my colleague. I \nsalute her for her compassion. I salute her for all the great work she \ndoes in this Chamber.\n  Three points: This bill has nothing to do with abortion. We shouldn't \nfear it. People who are on either side of abortion should not fear this \nbill. The States have already passed laws similar to this. They have \nnot affected abortion. That is point No. 1.\n  Point No. 2: The Feinstein amendment denies that there is a second \nvictim. If you care that there is a second victim, if you care about \njustice, don't vote for the Feinstein amendment.\n  Point No. 3: The Feinstein amendment is drafted, unfortunately, so \nthere is no penalty for the killing or the injuring of the child.\n  That is a problem. I don't think anyone intends for that to be the \ncase in the sense of voting that way. If you vote for the Feinstein \namendment, you are denying that there is a second victim. You are also \ndenying that there will be any penalty for the killing or the injuring \nof that victim. That is what a vote for the Feinstein amendment would \ndo. I ask my colleagues to vote no on the Feinstein amendment.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I have an amendment No. 2859 at the desk. \nI ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mrs. Murray] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2859.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 2 hours equally divided on the \namendment. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today I am offering an amendment to help \nprevent violence against women and children. We have heard a lot of \ntalk today about punishing abusers. Now it is time to see who is \nserious about preventing abuse in the first place.\n  As someone who has spent my entire public life talking with victims, \nvisiting shelters, working with advocates in law enforcement, and \nfunding the programs victims rely on, I am here this afternoon to offer \nan amendment that will help women and children get the help they need \nto be safe and, most importantly, to save their lives.\n  Mr. President, the amendment I am offering this afternoon is built on \nwhat victims and experts have told me they need. That is why this \namendment has been endorsed by the National Coalition Against Domestic \nViolence and the Family Violence Prevention Fund. These organizations \nknow what victims need, and they say the Murray amendment will really \nhelp victims of violence.\n  Mr. President, I am honored to say that my amendment is named for \nPaul and Sheila Wellstone, who were such champions for victims of \ndomestic violence. Senator Wellstone and I introduced legislation which \nis today included in this amendment. Paul's desk was just behind me \nhere on the Senate floor. I can still see him behind me waving his arms \nand making the case for people who have no voice.\n  This amendment is a real tribute to Paul and Sheila and the fight we \ncarry on for the millions of people who need a voice in the U.S. \nSenate. Whenever Paul debated an issue, you could always tell who was \nreally standing up for families and who was just talking. The vote on \nmy amendment will reveal who is truly concerned about giving women and \nchildren the tools they need to escape violent relationships, and who \nis more interested in playing politics and attempting to undermine \nwomen's constitutional rights. Any Senator who is truly concerned about \nthe safety of women and children will join me and give battered women \nthe support they need to escape violent relationships before it is too \nlate.\n  Now, I have a feeling that during this debate we are going to hear a \nlot of excuses. Some Senators are going to stand up here and claim that \npreventing violence against women is somehow not relevant. Senators \nwill stand up here with the talking points that have been prepared for \nthem by the Chamber of Commerce and say that protecting women from \ndeadly abuse is somehow bad for business.\n  We are going to hear a lot of excuses. But I have something stronger. \nI have the actual stories of dozens of women who are being abused, who \nhave escaped abuse, or who have been killed by their abusers. Those are \nthe voices that need to be heard on the Senate floor, not talking \npoints from lobbyists, not the same old excuses from the very people \nwho are cutting Violence Against Women Act programs by $10 million. We \nhave had enough of that. We know where it has gotten us: 2 million \nwomen assaulted every year.\n  Nearly 1 in 3 adult women are assaulted. There are 4.9 million \nintimate partner rapes and physical assaults, and thousands of women \nevery year are killed by a spouse or a boyfriend. We know what all \nthose excuses have produced: Women who are beaten, raped, and murdered.\n  Some lobbyists and Members of Congress want to bury my amendment. You \nknow what. We have had to bury enough people already. Let's see who is \nserious about helping to prevent violence and who is just playing \npolitics with the lives of battered women.\n\n  Let me read a note I received from an advocate for victims of abuse. \nShe writes:\n\n       I have had many many clients over the years who have come \n     to me after they have been fired from work because they \n     missed a day of work to go to court to get a civil protection \n     order. In some of these instances, the women had sick days, \n     but they were still fired. Several of these women were forced \n     to return to their batterers after they lost their jobs \n     because they lost their income and they and their children \n     would have been homeless if they did not return.\n\n  These are some of the women who are trapped today and who desperately \nneed our help. Mr. President, my amendment is especially important \nbecause the Bush administration is cutting or freezing funding for \ncritical domestic violence programs. Every year, 2 million American \nwomen are sexually assaulted, stalked, or physically assaulted--2 \nmillion women every year. You would think that the White House would \nrecognize the need to fund domestic violence programs, but the \nPresident's latest budget offers more bad news to victims of violence.\n  Let me give you some examples. The President's budget cuts Violence \nAgainst Women Act programs by $10 million. It cuts a Justice Department \nrape prevention program by $29 million. It freezes funding for the \ndomestic violence hotline, and it freezes funding for grants for \nbattered women shelters, precisely at a time when we need increases \nbecause evidence shows us that domestic violence increases during tough \neconomic times just as we are having today.\n  So I find it pretty ironic to be here today with a bill before the \nSenate that purports to help victims of domestic violence while it \nignores all we know about preventing it. Anyone who has talked with \nvictims' advocates and law enforcement knows that domestic violence \nprevention requires more support, not less--not less. It is clear that \nwe need to help victims escape violent relationships, and the Paul and \nSheila Wellstone domestic violence prevention amendment will help.\n  Mr. President, my amendment does several things. It gives victims of \nabuse\n\n[[Page S3152]]\n\naccess to unemployment insurance if they have been forced to leave \ntheir job because of violence. It gives victims of violence access to \nexpanded emergency leave so they can go to court or to the police to \nstop the abuse. It protects victims from employment and insurance \ndiscrimination. It provides services for children who witness domestic \nviolence so we can end that cycle of abuse. It helps health \nprofessionals screen for abuse and respond appropriately. It gives \nvictims better access to critical health services. Those are the steps \nwe need to take today to protect the more than 2 million women who are \nsexually assaulted, stalked, or physically assaulted every single year.\n  Mr. President, let me say a word about the relevance of my amendment. \nI expect some Senators will come here and claim that preventing \nviolence against women is somehow not relevant to the bill we are \ndebating today. To them, it never seems to be the right time. There is \nalways an excuse. In fact, these Senators are sending a message that \nvictims are not relevant until they are dead. If any Senator wants to \ncome down here and tell women across America that the abuse they face \nis not relevant, then they will have to make that insulting claim alone \nbecause I am going to keep fighting to get victims the help they need, \nto prosecute abusers and break the cycle of violence. You tell a woman \nwho is being abused she doesn't deserve more help; you tell a child who \nis witnessing abuse every night that my amendment is unnecessary. I am \nnot going to tell victims that. My amendment gives them the real help \nthey need.\n  Mr. President, victims of violence have heard a lot of excuses over \nthe years. Claiming that their daily abuse is not relevant to this \nSenate debate is just another of the excuses that have trapped women \nevery year in this country. That claim is as insulting as it is false.\n  Just look at the recent debate in the House of Representatives on \nthis underlying bill. During that debate, every single anti-choice \nMember who spoke referred to criminal acts of violence against women. \nViolence against women is a central part of this debate. Preventing \nviolence against women and helping women and children who are being \nabused is central to this discussion.\n  Opponents cannot have it both ways. They cannot claim that their bill \nis needed to address the violence against women and then claim we \nshould not debate ways to prevent violence against women. This \namendment is clearly relevant and will truly help women and children.\n  Anyone who wants to claim it is not relevant will have to answer to \nthe victims to whom they are denying help. Either you are serious about \nhelping women and victims or you are playing politics and making \nexcuses.\n  Women and children who are being violently abused every day deserve \nto know where their Senators stand, and Members of Congress are \ncertainly hearing from outside groups on this, from groups that are not \nknown--not known--for their advocacy on fighting domestic violence.\n  Yesterday, Senators received a letter from the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce urging them to oppose my amendment. Bruce Josten, the \nChamber's Executive Vice President for Government Affairs, makes the \nChamber's case rather forcefully in his letter. He writes:\n\n       It is important to note as a preliminary matter that H.R. \n     1997 is clearly an inappropriate vehicle for this amendment \n     as the issues involved are completely unrelated.\n\n  ``Unrelated.'' We are dealing with a bill that claims to address the \ncrime of violence against women, but an amendment that would actually \nprevent violence is ``unrelated,'' according to the Chamber of \nCommerce.\n  Mr. Josten goes on to write:\n\n       The ill-designed programs promise to impose significant \n     costs on business, particularly small business.\n\n  So the Chamber argues that the cost of preventing further violence \nagainst women is too high to pay. In other words, preventing domestic \nviolence and giving women the tools to escape from abusive \nrelationships is bad for the bottom line.\n  Let's, for a minute, examine the economics of domestic violence. \nThere are costs associated with allowing domestic violence to continue, \nnot just for women but for businesses.\n  In 2002, economists Amy Farmer of the University of Arkansas and Jill \nTiefenthaler of Colgate University published a report on the economic \nimpact of domestic violence. They examined publicly available studies \nperformed in the United States, including the annual National Crime \nVictimization Surveys, two Physical Violence in American Families \nstudies, and seven studies in the national violence against women \nsurvey.\n  As Ms. Farmer explained:\n\n       Each study was intended to answer different questions, so \n     the data sets have different strengths and weaknesses. When \n     we incorporated these data into a single model of domestic \n     violence, a different picture emerged that can be seen from \n     any one study.\n\n  They found that absenteeism, tardiness, and turnover rates are all \nhigh among domestic abuse victims. Farmer's research also concludes \nthat domestic abuse may result in almost 7 million lost work days \nannually--7 million--reduced workplace productivity, increased \ninsurance costs, and lower profits.\n  The researchers also cited a 1995 Roper report that found that 49 \npercent of the Fortune 100 executives surveyed believed that domestic \nviolence hurt their company's productivity, and 33 percent said it \nlowered their profits. So this is a problem that is real, and it has \nreal costs for businesses.\n  If you go to the Corporate Alliance to End Partner Violence, you can \nlearn some other interesting facts about domestic violence and how it \naffects the bottom line. On their site, you will find medical expenses \nfrom domestic violence costs $3 billion to $5 billion a year. \nBusinesses are paying $3 billion to $5 billion a year in health care \nfor victims of domestic violence.\n\n  You also learn that 94 percent of corporate security directors rank \npartner violence as a high security problem. They estimate that 75 \npercent of victims of domestic violence are harassed at work by their \nabuser.\n  Here is a startling fact they have on their Web site: Homicide is the \nNo. 1 leading cause of death on the job, and 20 percent of those \nmurders were committed by their intimate partner at the workplace.\n  What should we conclude from this data? Domestic violence is bad for \nbusiness. It has real and it has painful costs on employers. So for \nthose Members who want to weigh this measure against its economic \nmerits, as the Chamber does, the facts are clear. Providing the tools \nthat will allow abused women to escape abusive relationships can help \noffset billions of dollars in costs that domestic violence imposes on \nbusinesses.\n  But I hope my colleagues will consider more than the economics as \nthey cast their vote. I hope my colleagues will consider the cost to \nthe women and children who are the victims of domestic violence--the \ncost in pain, the cost in lives--and the pain and the lives we can \nprotect by giving women the tools they need to escape abusive \nrelationships.\n  I would like to share with my colleagues this afternoon some of the \nstories of the women we are trying to help with this amendment. These \nstories were shared with me by a nationally recognized advocate for \ndomestic violence victims.\n  Let me tell my colleagues a story about a woman who had worked at a \nmedium-sized organization for over a year as an administrative \nassistant. Her husband had been beating her on and off for over 15 \nyears of their relationship. When things escalated, she missed work due \nto a severe beating. She called in to work and was honest about what \nhappened to her. She came in to work the next day and was told she was \nfired. Her company told her they were afraid that her husband would \ncome to the workplace and hurt her coworkers, although that had never \nhappened before.\n  She did not qualify for job guaranteed leave under the Family and \nMedical Leave Act because the company employed less than 50 employees \nand, arguably, her injuries from the beating did not qualify as a \nserious health condition. So it made her firing legal.\n  If VESSA--the act we are talking about--had been in effect, she would \nhave had access to job guaranteed leave or perhaps a provision \nprohibiting employers from discriminating against victims of domestic \nviolence.\n\n[[Page S3153]]\n\nShe applied for and was denied unemployment insurance.\n  This is a real woman. This is what happened to her. It could be your \nnext-door neighbor. It could be your daughter.\n  There is another woman who worked as a hospital nurse. She just left \nher batterer and was concerned that he might follow her to her \nworkplace. She told her employer of her fears, and they fired her. She \napplied for unemployment insurance. She was denied.\n  Another story: Abusers often contact employers themselves to get the \nwomen they are abusing fired. One batterer called up the workplace and \ntold them his victim was HIV positive. He then told the employer that \nthe woman was a liar and was missing work so she could file a frivolous \nrestraining order against him. The woman took an earned sick day off \nfrom work, but when she returned to work, she was told she was fired \nbecause she was a victim of domestic violence. If VESSA had been in \nplace, that would have been illegal.\n\n  Another story: A woman was assaulted by her batterer in the parking \nlot at her workplace. She was then fired for ``being in a fight.''\n  Let me tell you about a woman who was strangled by her batterer. Her \ndoctor told her to stay home from work for 5 days after being \nstrangled. She called in sick to work, and she was fired because she \ndid not have enough vacation days and she did not qualify for family \nand medical leave because her employer was too small.\n  These are real people, Mr. President. These are our next-door \nneighbors. These are women who live in our communities. These are real \nstories.\n  Another example: One morning a woman was getting ready to go to work \nand her abuser came to her home with a gun. He told her that if she \nleft the house, he would kill her. She was able to call the police, and \nthe police came to her home and arrested the batterer. She got a police \nreport. She called her workplace and explained why she was unable to \ncome to work that day. The next day she returned to work and was fired \nfor missing work and was denied unemployment insurance.\n  Let me tell you another story: One woman got a call at work from her \nabuser. Her coworker overheard the conversation, and then her employer \ntook her aside and said since she was dealing with so much, she \ncouldn't possibly continue to work for him and fired her.\n  Here is an example of what happens when a woman tried to go to court \nto get help. A woman told her employer that she was in a violent \nrelationship and that she would need to take a day off from work to go \nto court to get a protection order.\n  The employer seemed supportive and agreed, so she took the day off \nand went to the court. The next day when she arrived at work, her \nsupervisor called her into his office and she was fired for missing \nwork, even though she had obtained permission the day before.\n  These are just some of the people who desperately need our help. \nThese are real stories. These are real women. They need this amendment \nto break out of these abusive relationships.\n  Let me take a minute to put this amendment in context because it is \nthe next logical step in the progress that we have been making in \nfighting domestic violence. We have come a long way over the past few \nyears in dealing with domestic violence. Not long ago domestic violence \nwas considered a family problem. It was something people did not talk \nabout. That climate made it very difficult for victims to seek help. It \nprevented friends or neighbors from getting involved in what was \nconsidered someone else's business.\n  Today stopping domestic violence is everyone's business, thanks to \nthe Violence Against Women Act, which I was proud to work on and help \npass. For the first time, the Violence Against Women Act recognized \ndomestic violence as a violent crime and a national public health \ncrisis. It laid out a coordinated strategy to bring advocates, \nshelters, prosecutors, and law enforcement professionals together to \nfight domestic violence. I was proud to help reauthorize the Violence \nAgainst Women Act in 2000.\n  Over the years, I have been proud to work with advocates from \nWashington State and across the country to strengthen these violence \nagainst women programs, to increase the funding, and to help raise \nawareness. So the Violence Against Women Act was the first step and it \nhelped us respond to the immediate threat of abuse. Now it is time for \nus to address the long-term problems that victims face. We need to \nbreak down the economic barriers that trap these women in abusive \nrelationships, and we need to reach out to the children who witness \nthis violence, help health care professionals stop the cycle of \nviolence and truly protect women and children.\n  Let me take a few moments to walk through the parts of my amendment \nand show how it will help prevent and stop abuse. My amendment gives \nvictims of violence access to unemployment compensation. Specifically, \nit provides victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual \nassault, or stalking with unemployment insurance if they have been \nseparated from their employment as a result of the violence.\n  Many abusers trap their victims financially, limiting their ability \nto work and forcing them out of a job. I will share some statistics \nthat have been compiled by the National Coalition Against Domestic \nViolence. Many victims of domestic violence have current or former \npartners who interfere with their efforts to work by harassing them on \nthe job, threatening them and their children, withholding \ntransportation, or beating them so severely they cannot work. In \naddition, more than 25 percent of domestic violence victims surveyed in \nthree national studies reported they lost a job due at least in part to \ndomestic violence.\n  We know that a job is often the only way for a victim to build up \nresources for themselves to eventually leave a violent relationship, \nbut abuse and stalking can make it impossible for a victim to keep a \njob. We know of cases where abusers will deliberately sabotage a \nvictim's ability to work, placing harassing phone calls, cutting off \ntheir transportation, showing up at the workplace and threatening \nemployees. When a victim loses her job because of violence, she should \nhave access to unemployment insurance compensation benefits.\n\n  During this debate some may claim this is some big, onerous \nexpansion. I have seen the talking points from the groups that want to \nkill this genuine effort to protect women from violence, and they have \nit wrong. This is not some dramatic expansion. In fact, today 25 States \nalready provide some type of unemployment insurance assistance for \nvictims of domestic violence. We can offer that same protection to \nvictims in every State, and we have an obligation to do it.\n  My amendment will also protect victims by allowing them unpaid time \nto get the help they need. Today a woman can use family and medical \nleave to care for a sick or injured spouse, but many women cannot use \nthat act to go to court to stop the abuse. My amendment fixes that. We \nknow that taking a day off of work to go to court or to go to the \npolice can save a woman's life. My amendment ensures women will not be \npunished for taking those steps that they need to take to protect \nthemselves from abuse.\n  Let me turn to another part of my amendment which deals with the \nchildren who witness domestic violence. Batterers often harm children \nas well as their intimate partners, and witnessing violence can have a \nserious impact on young children and all children. Let me offer some \nstatistics about abuse and children to put this in perspective.\n  Between 3.3 million and 10 million American children annually witness \nassaults by one parent against another. In 43 percent of households \nwhere intimate violence occurs, at least one child under the age of 12 \nlives in that home. Children are caught in the crossfire of abuse, and \nwhile we know all children are affected differently, we do know that \nchildren who witness violence at home may display emotional and \nbehavioral differences as diverse as withdrawal, low self-esteem, \nnightmares, or aggression against their peers, family members or \nproperty.\n  We know that witnessing abuse by a child can contribute to the cycle \nof violence. The Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention \nat the U.S. Department of Justice finds that as many as 40 percent of \nviolent juvenile offenders come from homes where\n\n[[Page S3154]]\n\nthere is domestic violence. In my home State of Washington, we are now \nall too aware of the price children pay in cases of domestic violence.\n  In April of 2003, the Tacoma police chief, David Brame, shot and \nkilled his wife Crystal. Then he took his own life, all while their two \nyoung children watched. The final tragic act was the last in a long \nhistory of abusive events that often played out in front of their two \nsmall children.\n  According to the police report, David Brame had been driving around \nin a shopping center parking lot in Gig Harbor that day when he spotted \nhis wife Crystal and the couple's children as she was parking the car. \nBrame shot her and then turned the gun on himself.\n  According to a witness, 7-year-old Haley told her:\n\n       My daddy is a policeman and he is very mean to my mommy. I \n     think my daddy has killed her.\n\n  Then Haley told officers she had seen her dad point a gun at her \nmom's head in the past.\n  Detectives talked to the son, David, 5 years old, at the hospital a \nfew hours later as the mother was fighting for her life. They asked the \nlittle boy, 5 years old, ``Did you see the gun?''\n  He answered:\n\n       Yeah. And, it shooted my mom into flat dead.\n\n  The children talked about past anger between their mother and their \nfather and what led to that terrible day. That is just one terrible \nexample of the trauma that children who live with domestic violence \nhave to live with. It should be our collective goal to help them \novercome it.\n  This is how this amendment would help children who witness domestic \nviolence. It establishes grants to children who have been exposed to \ndomestic violence such as I just described. It supports direct \ncounseling and advocacy, early childhood and mental health services, \nlegal advocacy and specialized services. It provides training for \nschool personnel to develop effective prevention and intervention \nstrategies. It helps child welfare agencies, domestic violence, and \nsexual assault service providers work together to protect the children.\n  Finally, it supports multisystem intervention models and crisis \nnurseries for children who are exposed to violence in their home.\n  Children who witness domestic violence have special needs. They are \nnot being addressed today. We have an obligation to change that.\n  Let me turn to the next part of my amendment, which increases health \nscreening so more victims can get assistance. More than one in three \nwomen who seek care in emergency rooms for violence-related injuries \nwere injured by their intimate partner. Unfortunately, most victims who \nseek health care leave the doctor's office without addressing the \nunderlying cause of their injuries. They leave that untreated, and that \nis the violence they suffered. The cost of intimate partner violence \nexceeds $5.8 billion every year; $4.1 billion of that is for direct \nmedical and mental health care services.\n  Health care providers can do a great deal to stem the tide of \ndomestic violence before it becomes life threatening. A 1999 study \npublished in the Journal of the American Medical Association found only \n10 percent of primary care physicians routinely screen for intimate \npartner abuse during new patient visits, and 9 percent routinely screen \nduring periodic checkups.\n  Emerging research shows us hospital-based domestic violence \ninterventions could reduce health care costs by 20 percent. My \namendment will help ensure health care providers are trained in how to \nidentify and serve victims of domestic violence, and provide grants to \nstrengthen health care systems' responses to domestic violence.\n  My amendment will promote public health programs that integrate \nfamily violence assessment and intervention into basic care. It \nencourages collaboration between health care providers, public health \nprograms, and domestic violence programs.\n  My amendment will lead to more effective interventions, more \ncoordinated systems of care, greater resources to educate health care \nproviders about domestic violence, and ultimately what we all want, \nmore women receiving help.\n  In December of 1999, the New England Journal of Medicine published a \nmajor study on the risk factors for injury to women from domestic \nviolence. Here is what one of the researchers, Dr. Robert Muelleman, \nhad to say.\n\n       A lot of women who have died from domestic violence had \n     been seen in their local emergency rooms at least 2 years \n     before their deaths. In America, 2 to 4 million women are \n     injured each year, and 1 to 2 million of those show up in \n     emergency rooms. Of these, 2,000 to 3,000 a year end up as \n     homicides.\n       It's clear that medical professionals in the emergency room \n     can be a great help in identifying at-risk women and \n     directing many of them to supportive resources before it's \n     too late.\n\n  That is from Dr. Robert Muelleman of the University of Nebraska \nMedical Center.\n  Let me turn to another part of my amendment, which expands the \nservices available to victims of abuse. My amendment gives the States \nthe option to use Medicaid to help victims, it ensures domestic \nviolence screening and treatment is covered by the Federal Employees \nHealth Benefit Program, and finally my amendment ensures States use \nsome of the maternal and child health block grant on domestic violence \nscreening and treatment.\n  Those are the main provisions of my amendment. Extending unemployment \ninsurance benefits for victims of abuse, offering family and medical \nleave so a victim can go to court or the police station to get help, \nending insurance and employment discrimination, providing help for \nthose children who witness abuse, offering access to health care for \nvictims, and improving the way our health care providers screen for \ndomestic violence.\n\n  My amendment combines the protections and services victims, law \nenforcement, and advocates tell us are needed, based on their real \nworld experiences every day on the front lines of domestic violence. We \nhave an opportunity today finally to make a real difference for \nmillions of women who are being assaulted. We can save lives and we can \neliminate all the costs domestic violence imposes on our businesses, on \nour families, and on our communities. The question is whether we are \nserious about helping to prevent violence against women.\n  The underlying bill before the Senate today focuses only on penalties \nafter a woman has been abused. My amendment aims to prevent that abuse \nin the first place. After a woman has been killed, it is too late. We \nhave to stop this abuse before it ends up killing some woman. My \namendment gives women today the tools to escape deadly abuse.\n  Are the Senators in the Chamber serious about helping victims of \nabuse? That is the question before us.\n  Frankly, I don't care what the lobbyists say out there. The Chamber \nof Commerce has lobbyists lined up and down the hall, and they have \nplenty of people making their case. But I tell you, the women whose \nstories I shared with you today don't have lobbyists lined up in the \nhall.\n  I have been to the shelters. I talked to the women who have been \nbeaten. I have looked in their eyes and I know the odds they are up \nagainst. I know what I would say next time I am looking into the eyes \nof the victim of abuse.\n  My colleagues will have to decide for themselves if they are going to \ngive her excuses or throw a lifeline to help her escape the violence \nthat may kill her. I say to my colleagues, what are you going to say to \nthe victims of abuse? Your vote will speak volumes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to address my \nconcerns about the amendment my friend and colleague from Washington, \nSenator Murray, has offered to the underlying bill.\n  First, let me commend my colleague for her passion, for her \ndedication to promoting public awareness about domestic violence, and \nfor her dedication to this cause. She certainly is a tireless advocate \nin these efforts to help end domestic abuse. She is steadfast and \nunwavering in her commitment to these issues, and I applaud her for \noffering this amendment today.\n  But, reluctantly, I come to the floor this afternoon to oppose this \namendment. I say this not because I am opposed to all the provisions of \nher amendment, but because the reality is\n\n[[Page S3155]]\n\nthis is not the time or the place for this amendment. Her amendment \nbeing offered to this bill, as a practical matter, does not have any \nchance of becoming law. We understand how not only this body but the \nother body operates. The truth is, what the agreement to this amendment \nwould do is stop the underlying bill. When we look at the calendar, \nwhen we look at the reality of the other body, when we look at what is \ngoing on in this body, the agreement to this amendment to this bill \nwill stop this bill. It will kill this bill.\n  So when Members come to the floor, I implore them to think about \nthis, however tempting it might be to agree to this amendment. It is a \nvery big amendment. It is a very complex amendment. Some of my other \ncolleagues in just a moment will talk about the merits of this \namendment. I am not going to get into that.\n  I have a long history in the House, when I was in the House and later \nwhen I was Lieutenant Governor of Ohio, and now in the Senate, of \nsupporting the cause of dealing with the problem of domestic violence. \nSo many other Members of the Senate have done that as well. I don't say \nI am the only one. Other Members have had a great record. My colleague \nhas a great record.\n  But the reality is this amendment, however well intended, cannot \nbecome law this way. It will not become law this way, and it will have \nthe effect of killing this underlying bill. So, therefore, I must \noppose this amendment. This amendment would kill this bill.\n  We are so close to seeing the underlying bill, a bill we have worked \nso hard to pass, actually go to the President.\n  The House has passed it. We are very close to passing it here in the \nSenate and sending it on to the President for his signature. The only \nthing, frankly, that now stands between this bill becoming law and \ngoing to the President for his signature is the Murray amendment.\n  At this point, I will yield time to my colleague from the State of \nUtah for his comments about this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I couldn't agree more with the comments the \ndistinguished Senator from Ohio just made. This is a very important \npiece of legislation. It should not be killed on by this last-minute, \n158-page amendment, which has not had a single hearing.\n  I have long been a supporter of ensuring that our Nation's laws \nextend all the protections available to women who are victimized by \ndomestic and other violence.\n  Along with Senator Biden, I have taken the lead in addressing this \nissue through national legislation with the passage of Violence Against \nWomen Act.\n  I commend Senator Biden for the work he has done on that. But it took \na bipartisan effort to get that through. Of course, I worked very hard \nside by side with him to get that bill passed, and have stood up for it \never since.\n  Because of the passage of the Violence Against Women Act, the \nDepartment of Justice is now authorized to coordinate with Federal and \nState governments, as well as international governments, on matters \nconcerning violence against women.\n  In fact, the Bush administration will allocate almost $400 million \nthis year alone for these worthy programs.\n  I note with a sense of pride that a former adviser to my Woman's \nAdvisory Council from Utah is now the director of the Office on \nViolence Against Women in the Department of Justice. She is doing a \nterrific job.\n  Violent crimes against women continue to be among the most under-\nreported. Even so, the statistics that are reported do not convey the \nfeeling of fear and vulnerability millions of women across this country \nmust face in our streets and all too often in their own homes.\n  To address this problem, effective intervention in the area of \ndomestic violence requires coordinated efforts by police, prosecutors, \ncounselors, and courts. It demands a major commitment by Government at \nall levels, Federal, State, and local. I am proud to help in \ncoordinating the response to this important issue and have been very \nproud to have done so in the past. I intend to continue addressing \nthese concerns in the future.\n  I say all of this to set the backdrop for why I urge my colleagues to \nvote against the Murray amendment.\n  Let me say at the outset I appreciate my colleague, Senator Murray, \nfor attempting to advance the discussion on this issue. As someone who \nhas been working on this matter my whole political career--and even \nbefore I officially began my political career--I know how difficult it \nis to craft effective legislation which truly makes a difference in \nthis area of the law. It takes countless hours of hearings, meetings \nwith interested and affected constituents, as well as committee markups \nto ensure what is ultimately passed is well formulated and well vetted \nso you accomplish the goals you set for yourself without causing \nunintended consequences.\n  This is a complex area of law. I am sorry to say, however, this \namendment has not been adequately scrutinized. In fact, I am told no \ncommittee has examined this proposal, leaving it with far too many \ntroubling provisions.\n  This is not a simple amendment. It is 158 pages long. Let me take a \nmoment to point out just a few of the more troubling provisions \ncontained within the Murray amendment. I am only talking about a few of \nthem. There are plenty more.\n  In this Congress we have taken on a number of civil justice reforms. \nFrom class action to medical malpractice reform to asbestos reform, \nwhich I am hopeful we will consider in the next week or so, we have \nsubstantively addressed many of the more troubling aspects of civil \nlawsuit abuse. This amendment, however, takes us exactly in the wrong \ndirection after all of that work.\n\n  For instance, section 112 allows plaintiffs to recover liquidated \ndamages in addition to other damages under this amendment. This is a \ntechnical area of the law. But it is a very important area. What this \namendment does makes absolutely no sense. It doesn't have a chance in \nthe world of going through the whole Congress, but will in essence \ndestroy this very worthy and important bill.\n  Liquidated damage provisions are appropriate when the actual damages \nare too difficult to ascertain. Accordingly, in lieu of actual damages, \nparties agree upon a reasonable estimate of liquidated damages. Thus, \nliquidated damages are used as a substitute for actual damages and not \nas a supplement to them. Courts simply do not enforce liquidated \ndamages that are merely intended to serve as a penalty.\n  In this litigation-prone country we have right now, this would go \ncompletely awry, and it would undermine, it seems to me, what we are \ntrying to do to prevent violence against women in the end.\n  What it seems the Murray amendment is trying to do is codify a set \nformula for determining punitive damages by automatically doubling the \namount for compensatory damages with the possibility of a reduction if \ngood faith is shown. But if that is the intent, the bill is not drafted \nproperly to carry out that intent.\n  This glaring error is just one example of what occurs when a bill \ndoes not undergo the scrutiny required to pass sound legislation.\n  It took us years to pass the Violence Against Women Act--not because \nwe were stupid and not because we didn't want to do it faster, but \nbecause we had to listen to experts and make the appropriate changes \nthat have made it the great law it is today.\n  What will happen if this amendment is adopted? First of all, this \namendment isn't going to go anywhere, anyway. But if it is adopted, it \nwill destroy this bill. Basically it will undermine what all of us--a \nvast majority in this body--are trying to do.\n  The one reason we created the committee system, of course, is to \ncorrect and vet legislation rather than wasting valuable floor debate \ntime.\n  An additional provision found in the Murray amendment pertaining to \nclass action--section 112(g)--appears to fly in the face of the efforts \nof a vast majority of Senators. It makes no effort to take into \nconsideration issues that trouble the majority of Senators. This \namendment codifies in the United States Code a right to bring class \nactions.\n  I have helped lead the fight in this Congress to reform the \nsubstantial\n\n[[Page S3156]]\n\nabuses that have occurred by some unscrupulous trial lawyers, personal \ninjury lawyers primarily, who have brought unjustified class actions in \nan attempt to extort settlements from companies across this country. \nThat is right. Extort settlements. In fact, well over 50 of my \ncolleagues--truth be known, over 60 of my colleagues have joined with \nme to take a stand against these abuses. In light of this clear \nexpression of sentiment, it makes no sense to codify in the United \nStates Code this class action authorization. It flies in the face of \neverything we are doing around here.\n  Obviously, there has been no serious effort to address the legitimate \nconcerns of the bipartisan majority of the Senators working on the \nclass action issue, and we have worked on it for years. We are still \nworking on it. We have come a long way. We now have a supermajority of \nSenators who will support class action reform as it should be \nsupported. But it took years for us to get there. Unlike some 158-page \namendment that has not been well thought through but brought up on the \nfloor suddenly. However well intentioned the efforts are, in the end, \nthe result will be to destroy the underlying bill that the vast \nmajority of us would like to pass.\n  I am sure Senators Grassley, Kohl, Carper, and I will work with the \ndistinguished Senator from Washington in good faith, if she will work \nwith us in good faith with regard to her concerns as exemplified in \nthis 158-page amendment.\n  Finally, let me point out another provision of the Murray amendment \nthat opens the door to further lawsuit abuse.\n  In a country that has long been known for its litigation abuse, and \nwe all know this is true, these ill-thought-out litigation matters are \nrunning us into bankruptcy--ruining businesses throughout the country, \nnot getting money to those who deserve them, and driving a set of \nunscrupulous trial lawyers who basically know better but who are more \ninterested in making money than they are in doing what is right.\n  Section 134 of this 158-page amendment itemizes what can be recovered \nin a lawsuit brought under this amendment.\n  In addition to the ordinary recoveries already permitted in the civil \njustice system, this amendment proposed by the distinguished Senator \nfrom Washington would permit a money recovery when the plaintiff \nsuffers ``inconvenience,'' ``loss of enjoyment,'' and other non-\npecuniary losses. Recovery for inconvenience? Recovery for loss of \nenjoyment? My gosh, what does that mean in the law? Anyone who takes \nthe metro during rush hour suffers from inconvenience. And, I might \nadd, loss of enjoyment. This type of language is absurd. It should not \neven be considered by this right-thinking body.\n  I am just mentioning a few of the problems. I don't want to take much \nlonger because there is only an hour on each side in this debate. These \nare just a few of the problems caused by this amendment as it relates \nto civil justice judiciary issues, important issues that should not be \ndealt with frivolously.\n  I have not touched on other problems caused by the amendment such as \nthe increase in taxes on small business that will inevitably follow if \nit is passed, the wholesale restructuring of state unemployment \ninsurance rules and regulations, as well as the substantial 11th \namendment concerns raised by this poorly drafted but well-intentioned \namendment.\n  I understand others will come to the floor to discuss these issues so \nI don't intend to repeat them now. They are important issues. This is \nnot an itty-bitty amendment. This is a major amendment that literally \nhas not had a day of hearings.\n  I take a backseat to no one, not anyone, in ensuring that Congress \ndoes everything it can to provide protections, support, and resources \nto combat domestic violence. But this amendment is not well written. Or \nperhaps I should say, not only is it not well written, it is \noverwritten in many respects.\n  Because of the problems replete in the Murray amendment, I cannot \nvote in favor of it. I recommend Senators on both sides of the aisle \nvote against this amendment. We will certainly sit down with the \ndistinguished Senator and look at her goals and her aims, try to help \nher fashion this amendment so that it can pass the Senate in a form \nthat literally makes sense in the law, makes sense in reality, and \nmakes sense in practicality.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). Who yields time?\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield such time as he needs to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Wyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. I rise in opposition to the amendment offered by the \nSenator from Washington. This amendment is a sweeping expansion of \nFederal employment law without a hearing, without committee debate, \nwithout committee amendments, and without any potential for floor \namendments. We never legislate like that. This bill does not just have \none concept in it; it has many concepts in it. It is 158 pages. That \nmakes it evermore unworkable to do in the Senate. This just is not how \nwe legislate.\n  As chairman of the Subcommittee on Employment, Safety, and Training, \nI am compelled to discuss the implications of such an unprecedented and \nmisguided expansion of current law.\n  Let me begin by saying I share Senator Murray's concern about \ndomestic violence. Domestic violence shatters families and with it the \nvery foundation of our society. My opposition to the amendment is not \nbased on a lack of concern for victims of domestic violence. A good \ntitle does not make a good amendment. I am opposing this amendment \nbecause it is an unprecedented expansion of workplace laws without any \nconsideration for the committee of jurisdiction.\n  This amendment greatly expands workplace laws without any hearings or \nCommittee consideration. The amendment creates a new set of laws \nrequiring businesses--including small businesses--to provide employees \nwith additional leave and special accommodation. However, the amendment \nhas not been reviewed by the Committee of jurisdiction. It creates new \nworkplace requirements without considering the impact of its \nimplementation or its relation with existing laws. The process is \nflawed and irresponsible.\n  The amendment creates broad, vague workplace requirements that \nconflict with existing law and invite litigation. It creates new rights \nto leave and prohibitions against employment discrimination against \ndomestic violence victims that are inconsistent with current employment \nlaws, including the Family and Medical Leave Act (the FMLA), the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of \n1964, and the Civil Rights Act of 1991. The nondiscrimination \nprovisions extend to ``perceived'' victims of domestic violence who \nhave never been subjected to domestic violence. The Murray amendment \ndefines a victim of domestic or sexual violence to include family \nmembers of domestic or sexual violence victims. Under this definition, \nabusers such as parents who molested their own children would be \nprotected under the Murray Amendment.\n  This amendment creates unprecedented Federal workplace regulation on \nsmall business. Congress has recognized the burden of workplace \nregulation on small businesses with limited resources. The FMLA exempts \nbusinesses with fewer than 50 employees from coverage. The Murray \namendment would cover all employers with 15 or more employees.\n  The lack of administrative alternatives increases litigation and \nburdens courts. Unlike existing federal anti-discrimination laws, the \nMurray amendment allows claimants to bypass the Equal Employment \nOpportunity Commission, EEOC, and file a private suit directly in \ncourt. This undermines the efficacy of the EEOC and this amendment.\n  These are unlimited damages for employment discrimination caused by \nsomeone else. Unlike existing Federal laws which cap damages for \nemployment discrimination, the Murray Amendment allows unlimited \ncompensatory damages, and punitive damages of up to 300 percent of \nactual damages. Why should a victim of domestic violence discrimination \nbe able to recover greater damages than a victim of race or disability \ndiscrimination?\n  The amendment imposes an unfunded Federal mandate on State \nunemployment compensation. The Murray Amendment imposes a Federal \nMandate to cover domestic violence under\n\n[[Page S3157]]\n\nstate unemployment compensation programs. This requires states to pay \nthe tab, but gives them no voice in whether or now to do so. Employers \nin States that fail to comply must pay huge penalties in the form of \nhigher Federal Unemployment tax. Unemployment compensation is--and \nshould remain--a state issue.\n  With vague, broad language that conflicts with current employment \nlaw, lawyers--not domestic violence victims--will be the biggest \nwinners under the Murray amendment.\n  The Senator from Washington is the ranking Member of the Subcommittee \non Employment, Safety, and Training. Many of the provisions in this \namendment fall within that subcommittee's jurisdiction. The rest of \nthem fall under the jurisdiction of the Senator from Utah, who chairs \nthe Judiciary Committee, who just spoke from that perspective.\n  The first time we are considering this major expansion of Federal \nemployment law is on the Senate floor on a bill totally unrelated to \nemployment and, I have to add, unamendable. There is an agreement \nbetween the two sides there would be two amendments today, and those \namendments would not be amendable, nor would there be allowed any \nintervening action. What we have is what we get. I have to say, no one \nis going to want to get that.\n  The overly broad and vague provisions of this amendment conflict with \nand undermine existing employment laws. The committee process is so \nimportant because that is where we carefully evaluate in a much less \nformal situation the impact of pending legislation and its relation \nwith current law.\n  Let me explain a little bit more how that committee process works. \nBesides the hearing part where we get to bring panels of experts before \nus and ask them extensive questions so we have a better understanding \nof what is going on and to give them an opportunity to speak on the \nprovisions that are before us, we also have what we call a committee \nmarkup.\n  The committee markup is where most of the work for this Chamber is \ndone. It is a much smaller group; it is a much more informal group. \nPeople turn in their amendments ahead of time so that they can be \nreviewed by all. Even on the day of the markup people can get together \nand work on amendments to get agreement. It is fairly successful. The \namendment process usually results in a bill coming from committee with \nabout 80-percent agreement.\n  The unfortunate thing for this country is that the bill comes to the \nfloor, and what we usually debate is the 20 percent we do not agree on. \nThat is not the case on this particular item. This has not even been \ndiscussed in committee, so the 80-percent agreement is not there. The \nability to work out issues with some flexibility is not there. I am \nsure there are provisions in this bill that are written in a way that \nthe author probably wishes were different. I certainly wish they were \ndifferent.\n  The first bill I ever did in the Wyoming legislature was only a \nthree-sentence bill when I took it to the legislature. In committee, it \ngot two amendments. On the floor, it got three amendments. When it went \nto the Senate side, it did not get any in committee but it got one on \nthe floor. What I learned through that process was that every step of \nthat made an important difference. It turned out to be a far better \nbill because all of the opinions of all of the people serving in that \nbody were injected and they could see a lot more different directions \nthan any one member of that body.\n  That is how we work it here. We work it so that the 100 Senators have \nan opportunity to take something as complicated as this and make \nchanges to it. Then the House looks at the same thing. Again, there are \na lot more opinions that get into the bill.\n\n  The committee process is so important because that is when we \ncarefully evaluate the impact of pending legislation and its \nrelationship to current law. We did not do that here. What we have here \nis a 158-page proposal which is not related to the underlying bill, and \nthat proposal rewrites employment law without the benefit of hearings \nor committee consideration. That process is flawed and irresponsible.\n  So, more specifically, what will this amendment do? It creates a new \nFederal law that mandates employers, including small employers, to give \nup to 30 days of leave to an employee to address domestic or sexual \nviolence. However, this proposal ignores important requirements that \nCongress applied to leave taken under the Family and Medical Leave Act, \nFMLA.\n  Let me highlight a few of the differences between FMLA and the Murray \namendment.\n  The Family and Medical Leave Act applies to employers with 50 or more \nemployees. The Murray amendment applies to employers with 15--that is \n15, instead of 50--employees. Most small businesses do not have the \nprocesses or personnel necessary to begin complying with this new leave \nrequirement.\n  In the past, Congress has recognized the burden of workplace \nregulations on small businesses. However, this amendment would impose \nworkplace regulations on small businesses never before covered by \nFederal employment laws. This amendment would undermine the small \nbusiness exemption Congress included in the Family and Medical Leave \nAct.\n  The Family and Medical Leave Act imposes a length-of-service \nrequirement for employees to be eligible for leave. The Murray \namendment has no service requirement for an employee to be eligible. \nUnder this amendment, a worker is presumably eligible for leave on the \nfirst day of work.\n  Under the Family and Medical Leave Act, employers can require a \nhealth provider to certify the need for leave. This amendment invites \nmisuse and abuse because there is no third-party verification--no \nthird-party verification--for the leave to be required. So if a person \nsays they were abused, that is good enough to take time off.\n  The Murray amendment does not amend the Family and Medical Leave Act \nitself; instead, it gives more capability to someone, under this \namendment, than they would get under the regular law. It is a backdoor \neffort to expand Federal leave law at the expense of equity and \nclarity.\n  This amendment prohibits employers from discriminating against an \nindividual who is ``perceived'' to be a victim--that is interesting \nwording, ``perceived'' to be a victim--of domestic or sexual violence. \nIndividuals with absolutely no legitimate claims of domestic or sexual \nviolence would have a cause of action under this vague and broad \nstandard.\n  How are employers and courts to determine who a ``perceived'' victim \nis? Whatever the intent of this legislation, the result will be \nexcessive confusion and, worse yet, excessive litigation. The amendment \ndefines a ``victim of domestic or sexual violence'' to include--and I \nam sure the Senator from Alabama, who is on this committee that has not \nhad a hearing on it yet, who is on the floor, will make some comments \non this--an ``individual whose family or household member has been a \nvictim of domestic or sexual violence.''\n\n  Under this definition, family-member abusers--such as parents who \nmolested their own children--would be protected under this poorly \ndrafted legislation. People could get time off for bad behavior.\n  There is a good reason for this process we have of hearings, \ncommittee markup, debate on the floor, with amendments, and then the \ndiscussion between the two bodies.\n  The problems with the amendment extend beyond poor drafting. This \namendment is inconsistent with the remedy and enforcement provisions of \nexisting employment discrimination laws. Under title VII of the Civil \nRights Act of 1964, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the Age \nDiscrimination in Employment Act, Congress gave the Equal Employment \nOpportunity Commission the role of investigating and enforcing \ncomplaints of employment discrimination. These existing laws require a \nclaimant to first file a complaint with the Equal Employment \nOpportunity Commission before being able to file a private suit in \ncourt.\n  The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission plays a vital role in \nemployment nondiscrimination laws. The Commission's mediation \nactivities expedite resolution of cases and reduce the backlog of \nemployment cases in our courts. This amendment would\n\n[[Page S3158]]\n\nallow victims of domestic violence discrimination to bypass the \nadministrative process and file suit in court. Allowing claimants to \nbypass the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission undermines the \nefficiency of the agency and the legislation.\n  This amendment disregards the remedy structure of other Federal \nemployment discrimination laws. Existing laws limit available damages. \nFor example, consequential and punitive damages for claims under title \nVII of the Americans with Disabilities Act are progressive with the \nsize of the employer and capped at $300,000. This amendment provides \nunlimited compensatory damages and punitive damages up to three times \nthe amount of the actual damages.\n  Why should a victim of domestic violence discrimination be able to \ncircumvent the complaint process that victims of race or disability \ndiscrimination must follow? Why should a victim of domestic violence \ndiscrimination be able to recover greater damages than victims of race \nor disability discrimination? There is no justification for this \nunequal treatment. We must guard against enacting legislation that, in \nan effort to protect individuals from one type of discrimination, \ncreates inequities for those who have been subjected to another type of \ndiscrimination.\n  I find the leave and discrimination provisions of this amendment very \ntroubling. I find the unemployment compensation provisions to be \nmisguided as well. The amendment requires States to provide \nunemployment compensation benefits to individuals who are separated \nfrom employment as a result of domestic violence. That has always been \nand is a State decision. Under the amendment, that is taken away from \nthe States. States can decide and, in many instances, have decided. \nIndividuals would receive unemployment compensation if they leave \nemployment because of a reasonable fear of domestic violence, a desire \nto relocate to avoid domestic violence, or to obtain physical or \npsychological treatment.\n  Eligibility for unemployment compensation is and should continue to \nbe a State--not a Federal--decision. The terms of unemployment \ncompensation are decided on a State-by-State basis. States have the \nauthority to extend unemployment compensation to victims of domestic \nviolence. A number of States have already done so. This amendment \nimposes a Federal mandate and higher costs on State unemployment \ncompensation programs. The Federal mandate will impose huge penalties \non employers in States that fail to comply. It is estimated that the \nFederal unemployment tax on all employers in the State will be \nincreased from $56 per worker to $434 per worker. How many jobs will \nthat cost?\n\n  A Federal mandate to cover domestic violence under State unemployment \ncompensation programs requires States to pay the tab. However, we give \nthe States no voice in whether or how to do so. It is unfair and \nirresponsible for Washington to impose this burden--and, in fact, \nagainst the law--on already burdened State unemployment programs and \nemployers.\n  Domestic violence is a serious problem that devastates lives and \nshatters families. However, we cannot allow a misguided attempt--with \nno hearings--to address this problem and create new problems that will \nimpose unfair burdens on States and employers, particularly small \nbusinesses.\n  When I am back in Wyoming, I like to hold town meetings so I can find \nout what is on the minds of my constituents. At each town meeting, \nthere is usually someone in attendance who is quite concerned about \nGovernment regulations. I am often told to rein big government in, keep \nthe rules and regulations simple and responsive, and make sure they \nmake sense.\n  This amendment takes the opposite approach. It is a classic example \nof one size fits all that doesn't fit outside the beltway.\n  The amendment ignores the careful consideration Congress has given to \nexisting employment laws with vague and broad language that conflicts \nwith current Federal employment law. Lawyers, not domestic violence \nvictims, will be the big winners in this one.\n  I will close by sharing a letter from a survivor of domestic violence \nwho divorced her first husband in 1978 because of abuse and, in \naddition, is an employment attorney with 23 years of experience \nspecializing in employment law.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the letter in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            Overland Park, KS,\n\n                                                   March 22, 2204.\n     Re Murray amendment S.A. 2859 (Domestic Violence Prevention \n         Act) to H.R. 1997 (Unborn Victims of Violence Act of \n         2004).\n\n     Senator Sam Brownback,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Brownback: I am writing to ask that you oppose \n     S.A. 2859 (Domestic Violence Prevention Act), proposed by \n     Senator Murray as an amendment to H.R. 1997.\n       I have reviewed the Murray Amendment from what I believe is \n     a rather unique perspective. I am a survivor of domestic \n     violence and divorced my first husband in 1978 because of the \n     abuse. I have also served on the Board of Directors for two \n     organizations devoted to the prevention of domestic violence \n     (see attached Exhibit ``A'' for more information). In \n     addition, I am an employment attorney with almost 23 years of \n     experience specializing in employment law.\n       As a result of my background and experiences, I am \n     sensitive to the victims' perspective, but also sensitive to \n     the employers' perspective. To say the least, the path from \n     victim status to survivor status is not easy, and it is \n     beneficial for victims to have resources available to help \n     them. At the same time, I am aware of the challenges faced by \n     employers in complying with new employment laws, especially \n     laws with good intent but which are poorly written and which \n     have not been given proper thought.\n       Although I very much appreciate the intent of the Murray \n     Amendment, I cannot support it, particularly Subtitle A \n     (Entitlement to Emergency Leave for Addressing Domestic and \n     Sexual Violence). Its intent may be laudable, but it will \n     have unintended consequences that could easily be avoided if \n     a more thoughtful approach to such a law were to be taken.\n       I have a number of concerns about Subtitle A of the Murray \n     Amendment. I have summarized my primary concerns below (with \n     a more detailed explanation attached as Exhibit ``B''):\n       1. Potential for Misuse and Manipulation. Subtitle A has \n     many loopholes that will allow it to be misused and \n     manipulated by employees and their abusers. I have identified \n     five different ways that Subtitle A can be easily misused or \n     manipulated (see Exhibit ``B''). The potential for misuse and \n     manipulation is directly related to the fact that an employee \n     merely has to sign a self-serving certification stating that \n     he/she is a victim of domestic violence. No verification \n     is required, nor are any mechanisms included in Subtitle A \n     to enable an employer to question the veracity of the \n     certification or to prevent fraud.\n       2. Perpetuation of Domestic Violence. One of the outcomes \n     of Subtitle A will be the perpetuation of domestic violence \n     in some situations. This can occur in two ways. First, an \n     abuser will be able to force a victim, under threat of \n     violence, to take domestic violence leave from work whenever \n     the abuser wants the victim to take time off from work for \n     reasons unrelated to the proposed law's stated purposes. \n     Second, a victim who is not making any effort to remove \n     himself/herself from a domestic violence situation can simply \n     take time off work after suffering abuse to ``recover'' from \n     injuries, even if he/she seeks no medical or other help. In \n     either situation, domestic violence leave will become a \n     method of merely ``managing'' or ``tolerating'' abuse and \n     threats of abuse. It will enable abuse instead of helping a \n     victim become a survivor.\n       3. Adequate Time Off From Work Already Available. I \n     seriously question the necessity of this law. I believe that \n     most employees already have adequate time off work programs \n     available to them in the event they need domestic violence \n     leave. Those time off programs include family and medical \n     leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) and its \n     state counterparts, leave of absence or other accommodations \n     under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and its state \n     counterparts, employers' existing vacation and sick day \n     policies, and employers' existing attendance policies. The \n     proponents of Subtitle A have not provided any data to verify \n     that employers' existing time off programs are inadequate.\n       4. Lack of Due Process for Employers. Considering that \n     Subtitle A requires employers to provide a new benefit to \n     employees, I find it appalling that employers have had no \n     opportunity to provide input or be heard on this proposed \n     law. Basic principles of fairness would seem to suggest that \n     employers be given due process (rather than be dictated to) \n     on an issue of this importance. I have no doubt that \n     employers could provide very useful comments and suggestions.\n       Subtitle A of the Murray Amendment raises many questions \n     that obviously have not been given much, if any, thought. \n     This letter is by no means to be read as including all of my \n     concerns about Subtitle A. I have others, but have tried to \n     focus on the major ones in this letter.\n       For the sake of sound policy for victims of domestic \n     violence like myself, for other employees who will have to \n     absorb their workload when they are absent due to domestic\n\n[[Page S3159]]\n\n     violence issues, and for employers who will have to comply \n     with this proposed law, I urge you to oppose Senator Murray's \n     Amendment S.A. 2859. Thank you for your thoughtful \n     consideration of my comments.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Sue Kennedy Willman.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. She writes:\n\n       Although I very much appreciate the intent of the Murray \n     amendment, I cannot support it.\n\n  She gives an explanation and lists four very specific reasons: One, \nthe potential for misuse and manipulation; two, the perpetuation of \ndomestic violence; three, adequate time off from work already \navailable; and four, the lack of due process for employers.\n  This is a person who has been there. This is a person who has been \nabused. She did find a way out. And incidentally, in her credentials, \nshe has devoted most of her life to helping battered women in the \nKansas City metro area and has an astounding record of doing that and \nis very concerned about us going this way.\n  Again, without a hearing, I am concerned, too. I urge my colleagues \nto oppose this amendment, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I listened carefully to the Senators from \nOhio and Utah and Wyoming express their concerns about the amendment as \nwe have written it. I know the underlying bill was not marked up in \ncommittee either, so I find that argument hard to believe.\n  I hear their argument. I understand they are going to defeat this \namendment. I want to move forward on the issue of domestic violence. It \nis extremely important that when we are talking about the abuse of \nwomen, that we do something to prevent it. I want to make sure we do \ntake a step forward.\n  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent to send a modified amendment to \nthe desk.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, that is frustrating. I listened to the \nSenators from the other side say they want to do something about \nprevention. I hear them saying they have objection to specific \nconcerns. I am willing to make a modification to my amendment to move \nit forward. It is fairly clear the Republican leadership simply doesn't \nwant to engage in a serious debate to address the cycle of violence. \nThat is unfortunate. We could take steps forward to change lives for \nwomen who have been victims of abuse.\n  I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from Louisiana, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that she be listed as a cosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana is recognized for 15 minutes.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I come to the floor to support my \ncolleague from the State of Washington and her comprehensive amendment \non this important bill and discussion this afternoon. I thank her for \nthe extraordinary work she has done in the area of domestic violence, \nnot just this year but in every year she has been a Member of this \nbody, over a long period of time, her intense interest and advocacy for \nwomen and for children and for families and for communities which her \neffort shows today.\n  I have a great deal of respect for the Senator from Ohio. He and I \nusually don't find ourselves on opposite sides, so it is unusual that I \nwould be here supporting an amendment and the Senator from Ohio, Mr. \nDeWine, would be opposing it. I understand there are a few--not many--\ngood reasons that people could raise today against this amendment. But \nI will tell you what one of the reasons is not that I have heard in \nthis Chamber and I have seen sent out by such groups as the U.S. \nChamber of Commerce and the U.S. Right to Life organization, two \norganizations that oppose Senator Murray's amendment. They have some \nlegitimate arguments in this document about some of the details of the \namendment, but they also go so far as to say that one of the reasons we \nshould not support this amendment is because it is irrelevant to the \nunderlying subject.\n  Irrelevant? Domestic violence is irrelevant to the deaths of pregnant \nwomen, when experts across the board, Republican and Democratic, people \nwho have been prosecutors before--go look at any study--will tell you \nthe majority of women who are killed in the latter terms of their \npregnancies are killed not by strangers, not by people who just happen \non to their house, but they are killed by the hands of their husbands \nor the fathers of their children?\n  I have to sit here and read a vote alert from the Chamber of \nCommerce, supposedly representing women who own businesses, supposedly \nrepresenting women, many of whom are business owners, who perhaps have \nbeen victims of domestic violence, and not a word in this memo about \n``so sorry that you were beaten so badly that you and your unborn \ndied,'' nothing. They go on to say this is an inappropriate vehicle for \nthis amendment because the issues involved are ``completely \nunrelated.''\n  I hope my Chamber of Commerce in Louisiana did not approve this \ndocument because I don't believe businesses in Louisiana think these \nsubjects are unrelated, since one of the recent things that just \nhappened in my State was a woman shows up to go to work about 2 years \nago in Jefferson Parish, gets out of her car, and in front of about 50 \npeople, going through the revolving doors to get into her place of \nbusiness, her husband comes up to her, takes out a revolver, sticks it \nin her face and blows her head off. Whether she was pregnant or not, I \ncan't recall. But to say that it is irrelevant to the subject that we \nare debating is an insult to many people.\n  Let me clarify one other point. People come to this floor and act \nlike the Senator from Washington and the cosponsor, who was Senator \nWellstone, before his death--he did a magnificent job on this subject \nthe years he represented his State in the Senate. In his memory, I will \nsay this: He worked like a Trojan on this subject. This bill was \nintroduced in the 106th Congress, the 107th Congress, and the 108th \nCongress. But this bill, although there has been one hearing, pushed \nmostly by Democrats, has never received a markup, not in the 106th, \n107th, and not in the 108th. Evidently, there is not enough Republican \nleadership thought that this is an important subject to discuss.\n\n  Those of us who came to the floor today to debate this issue to try \nto protect people from murder--women and, yes, their unborn children--\nwonder what we have actually accomplished today because with the \nunderlying bill, the only way you can prosecute people is if the murder \nactually occurs on Federal property.\n  The bill we are going to pass today is not nearly as good as the 21 \nor 31 statutes that are already on the books that are legitimate and \ngenuine efforts. When we asked to have some help for the victims of \ndomestic violence, who are women and their children, we get all kinds \nof ``can't do it,'' ``too complicated,'' ``too expensive.'' Then I have \nto read the Chamber of Commerce business alert that says the whole \nsubject is not relevant.\n  I want to read from ABCNEWS.com for the Record, ``Expectant Victim,'' \nApril 25.\n\n       On Monday, police found the remains of 20-year-old April \n     Renee Greer, whose dismembered body was found in a trash can \n     that had washed into a farmer's field. She was 8\\1/2\\ months \n     pregnant when she was reported missing on March 8.\n       Experts and women's advocates are not surprised to find \n     that pregnant women are especially prone to violent deaths. \n     In many cases, pregnant women are killed by their husbands or \n     significant others.\n       ``Most pregnant women are killed by people they know, like \n     husbands or boy friends''. . . .\n\n  Think of that. It is one thing to get attacked in a dark alley by \nsomebody you don't know; you are coming home later than you should be. \nIt is another thing to be beaten to death by someone who is supposed to \nlove you. It is very terrible for a child to sit there and watch their \nfather, in many cases, beat up their mother in front of them. It breaks \nmore than their spirit. It crushes their heart and destroys their life.\n  You would think that somebody on the other side of the aisle would \nthink this was significant and relevant and would want to do something \nabout it and put some money in this bill to do something about it. But, \nno, we don't have time for it, we can't have a hearing on it, and it is \ntoo complicated for anybody to understand.\n\n[[Page S3160]]\n\n  I don't think this is complicated. Let me go on to read this:\n\n       ``Sometimes it depends on how far along the woman is in the \n     pregnancy,'' she said.\n\n  This is Pat Brown, a criminal profiler and CEO of the Sexual Homicide \nExchange. I am sorry, I don't know what State.\n\n       ``Sometimes it depends on how far along the woman is in the \n     pregnancy,'' she said. ``If it's a serial killer, they \n     normally go after women who may be three months pregnant and \n     are not showing very much. With serial killers, the women are \n     tiny, easy to handle, not too big--someone they can easily \n     overcome. They go after a `neat package,' something that is \n     desirable where they could get something big.\n       ``With husbands or boyfriends, women tend to be eight \n     months pregnant--they're there and the baby is coming,'' \n     Brown continued. ``They can see the woman and unborn child as \n     something that is in the way, keeps them from living the \n     lifestyle they want.''\n\n  And we come to the floor and ask for a little help for domestic or \nsexual violence, maybe a little time off of work to get her situation \nin order because her husband is working and he also happens to be the \none beating her. She needs 30 days to get a job. They say: No, we \ncannot give you 30 days. We ask for 30 days of unpaid leave, and the \nChamber of Commerce goes wild saying they can't afford it--and they \ndon't have to pay for it.\n  We talk about increasing grants to local communities to help them \nprovide shelters, since we have not seen a significant increase in \nshelters, but that is too complicated.\n  So I ask, What have we done today? Are we going to save any lives, \nwhether it is the life of the unborn, or whether it is the life of a \nwoman? No, because there is no money in this for prevention. We, \nobviously, want to just prosecute people in a very small place, on \nFederal land, maybe just to make a point. I came to the Senate to do \nmore than just make a point, and I think the Senator from Washington \ncame here to make more than a point. We came here to make a difference. \nThis afternoon, there is no difference being made and it is a shame.\n  In conclusion, I want to say something about the Right to Life \nAssociation. I have worked with them on cloning. I don't support human \ncloning. Some people do; I don't. I have worked with them. When they \ncame to my office yesterday to tell me they were sorry that they could \nnot support the Murray amendment because it would ``mess up the \nbill''--and they need a clean bill--I would like to think they need an \neffective bill. But they just need a clean bill. For what, I am not \nsure. Maybe for television commercials.\n  I think we need an effective bill. I would like to prevent these \ndeaths of unborn children, of women, give prevention on the front end, \nand then go ahead and prosecute people. In my State, that is what we do \nbecause we already have a law on the books. So I am happy that \nLouisiana is already there. The Right to Life Association said they \ncould not support help for domestic violence victims because they, \nagain, agreed with the Chamber of Commerce that it is not relevant.\n\n  I hope people who support the Right to Life Association might write \nthem an e-mail or something today and explain to them that regardless \nof how you feel, whether you are pro-choice or pro-life, clearly, this \nis relevant to the underlying bill.\n  With that, I yield the floor. I support the Murray amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, before I yield to my friend and colleague \nfrom Alabama, let me say that I understand what my colleague from \nLouisiana has said and what my colleague from Washington State has \nsaid. I will reiterate what I said a few minutes ago.\n  The reality of the way this place works, the way the House works, is \nthat whatever the merits of this amendment, the passage of this \namendment will effectively mean, that the underlying bill will simply \ndie. The only thing to prevent the underlying bill from going to the \nWhite House and being signed by the President of the United States is \nthe Murray amendment. That is what the facts are.\n  If the Murray amendment is attached to this bill, we can kiss this \nbill goodbye. That is a fact. I yield to my colleague from Alabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Ohio for his \nleadership on this issue. He has taken the issue and considered it \nthoughtfully and prepared a seven-page piece of legislation that I \nbelieve, as a former prosecutor, stands the test of careful \ndraftsmanship and is worthy of passage. I believe we have a majority in \nthe Senate prepared to pass this legislation. But it is threatened by \nthis amendment. The Senator is correct that if this amendment passes, \nthis bill will not become law. So a vote for this amendment is a vote \nagainst the underlying legislation.\n  I further say the amendment--the 158-page amendment--is not so \ncarefully drafted, has quite a number of problems, and does not deal \neffectively with the issue that the Senator seeks to promote.\n  The day before yesterday, in my office, I met with a group of people \nfrom one of America's great corporations, an international corporation. \nI asked the human resources officer--and I asked them all--how things \nwere going out there and what can we do to help, what problems do they \nhave. The human resources officer said: The one thing causing us the \nmost grief is the Family Leave Act. For a lot of different reasons, \ncomplex reasons, this act is subject to abuse. We certainly believe and \nsupport a mother being home with a young child. We support the purposes \nof the act, but there are problems with it. We would like for you to \nlook at it and see.\n  That was shared with me the other day. It was totally unrelated to \nthis 158-page amendment that has not undergone careful scrutiny, and I \nbelieve goes much further and provides benefits that far exceed what is \nunder the current Family Leave Act, which has problems with it.\n  We need to, as Members, be careful what we pass, what we mandate on \nprivate entities, and what we tell them they must do. We should do so \nin a way that furthers the public policy we want to further, which is \nto help families who need leave for family emergencies. We want to do \nthat, and the act does it in many different ways. But it is not \nperfect. This amendment is even less perfect.\n  Let me show you a couple things we discovered in a brief reading of \nthe Murray amendment. It says:\n\n       The term ``victim of domestic or sexual violence'' includes \n     an individual whose family or household member has been a \n     victim of domestic or sexual violence.\n\n  Clearly, I think I can say, as a former prosecutor, that would \ninclude the perpetrator. That would include the wrongdoer. So now is \nthe wrongdoer going to be able to ask for time off? The law would \nmandate it, I suspect. Some say that would not happen. But I am telling \nyou, people use the law as it is written to further their agendas when \nthey want to. Maybe he had to go to court to defend himself, and he is \ngoing to claim time off for that. I bet you his lawyer would say he is \nentitled to time off.\n  Here is another one:\n\n       The term ``employee'' means any person employed by an \n     employer on a full or part-time basis, for a fixed time \n     period, on a temporary basis, pursuant to a detail, or as an \n     independent contractor.\n\n  That is not even in the current Federal Leave Act. So we have added \nthis statement. So the businessperson has to take care and provide \nleave or suffer. I think that is a step to which we ought to give a lot \nof thought before we put it into law.\n  Another thing that hit me in talking with this lady the day before \nyesterday, and talking about problems with the act, is the difficulty \nof a business in having any proof to ascertain that the person really \ndoes need leave. Under the act, after you get one approval, say, for a \nchild's asthma, you never have to present proof again, or even just \nmake a statement that it is so and the businesses are bound by it.\n\n  A lot of businesses on a manufacturing basis try to do things well. \nThey have a team that produces a product. When one member of that team \nunexpectedly or routinely misses, it makes it difficult for them. If \nthey have a legitimate excuse, OK. This says:\n\n       An employee may satisfy the certification requirement of \n     paragraph (1) by providing to the employer . . . a sworn \n     statement of the employee.\n\n\n[[Page S3161]]\n\n\n  That automatically takes care of it--no proof of a doctor's \ncertificate, a lawyer's statement, or anything else. I just point that \nout.\n  The hour is late. As a member of the Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee, as Senator Enzi said so eloquently and in detail, \nthese issues need to be given careful thought. Let's don't kill this \nunderlying bill Senator DeWine worked so hard on and has dealt with so \nmany Members of this body to refine language so everybody can agree to \nit and it will have a majority vote.\n  Let's don't kill this legislation that is important to protecting \nthose unborn victims of violence in America by tacking on an amendment \nthat is not ready, that has problems with it, on which we have not had \nhearings and should not be added to this bill, anyway. If it is added \nto the bill, the bill will be in trouble.\n  I thank the Chair. I thank Senator DeWine for his leadership. I yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I yield time to the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I had a chance to hear my colleague from \nOhio speak in humble terms about the work he did, the commitment he \nmade when he was working in Ohio at the State level and now in the \nSenate regarding issues of domestic abuse and sexual violence.\n  I don't know if there is a stronger champion in the Senate than my \ncolleague from Ohio, Senator DeWine, on these issues. I know where his \nheart is. I know where his passion is.\n  When I look at the Murray amendment, there are provisions in this \namendment I would like to support. There are principles in this \namendment on which I would like to work with her and I would like to \nsee happen. I believe--I know my colleague from Ohio feels the same \nway, and we have to be very candid, we have to be very blunt--that the \nreality is that the effect of the Murray amendment, if it were to pass, \nwould simply kill the underlying bill.\n  We have an opportunity to do something today for unborn victims of \nviolence. We have an opportunity to do something. Or we can do what I \nsee going on far too often in this Chamber, and that is to--I don't \nknow whether it is political gamesmanship, I don't know if it is \n``gotcha'' policy, I don't know what it is, but it is not about getting \nsomething done. We can get something done today. We can pass a clean \nUnborn Victims of Violence Act. For those of us who would like to work \nwith my colleague from Washington on some of these important \nprinciples, who really want to get something done, let's be honest and \nlet's do it in a form and manner in which we know something will \nhappen.\n  If this amendment is attached to this bill, this bill dies. Some of \nthe principles I may believe in and want to work on that are in the \nMurray amendment will go nowhere, and we all know that.\n  I did not come here to play a game, to participate in endless debates \nfor the sake of debating, to cast votes to be measured on ``you are for \nsexual violence or you are against.'' That is not what this is about. I \ngot elected on a belief that we could get some things done, and that is \nhard in this body because it is so easy to kill a bill. It is so easy \nto tack on an amendment that is so hard to vote against because we are \nafraid of being accused of being against domestic violence.\n  I am passionate about dealing with domestic violence. I was a \nprosecutor in the State of Minnesota and prosecuted some of the early \nchild abuse cases. I was mayor of the city of St. Paul. I thought we \ndid cutting edge things to deal with domestic and sexual violence. I \nwant to do more about domestic and sexual violence while I am here in \nthe Senate, but we are not going to do more about it by voting for the \nMurray amendment today.\n  I am going to cast my vote against the Murray amendment, even though \nI share a belief in some of the principles the good Senator from \nWashington is trying to raise. I am going to vote against it because I \nwant to get something done, and the one opportunity we have today, I \nsay to my colleagues, to get something done is to pass out of this body \na clean Unborn Victims of Violence Act. If we pass this bill and it is \nsigned into law, we have provided protection on the Federal level--by \nthe way, it is similar to what many States do and what we do in the \nState of Minnesota--for a mom and an unborn baby, such as the Laci and \nConner Peterson case. We all know many cases like that.\n  Again, I appreciate the principles my colleague from Washington is \nattempting to raise, but I think it is time to be very blunt and very \nhonest. If you want to do something about that issue, this bill is not \nthe place to do it. It will not go forward. It will not further the \nends about which we are talking.\n  We have an opportunity to do something today, and that is to pass the \nUnborn Victims of Violence Act. I support this bill in a clean manner. \nTomorrow I will work with my colleague from Washington and my colleague \nfrom Ohio and do what needs to be done to further some of the very \nlaudable goals she desires.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I yield to my colleague from Oklahoma. How \nmuch time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eleven minutes 50 seconds.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I yield to my colleague from South Carolina first.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, I thank Senator DeWine \nfor yielding. I will be brief.\n  We just rejected the idea Roe v. Wade rights should be used by \ncriminals to avoid prosecution for their criminal activity that results \nin the mother being denied to have a child. Roe v. Wade is an honest, \ngenuine debate that exists in this land. Eighty percent of Americans, \nwhen polled, believe if a criminal takes the right to have a child away \nfrom a mother, they ought to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the \nlaw for what has happened to that family--damage to the mother and \ndamage to the unborn baby.\n  Professor Walter Dellinger, a former adviser to President Clinton, \nsaid:\n\n     . . . although he is a strong advocate for a woman's right to \n     choose abortion, he sees no major problem with fetal-homicide \n     laws. ``I don't think they undermine Roe v. Wade,'' he said. \n     ``The legislatures can decide that fetuses are deserving of \n     protection without having to make any judgment that the \n     entity being protected has freestanding constitutional \n     rights. I just think that proposals like this ought to be \n     considered on their own merit.''\n\n  That is all we are asking. Senator Murray has a very long and \ncomplicated amendment that deals with domestic violence, family leave, \nand other issues. South Carolina, to its shame, for lack of a better \nword, has one of the leading number of domestic violence cases against \nwomen. Our legislature is dealing with that. We can do more here. But \nthis should stand on its own.\n  Just as we said no to Roe v. Wade being an impediment to prosecuting \na criminal who attacks a mother who chooses to have a child, we will \nnot let the criminal benefit from Roe v. Wade, nor should we allow an \namendment to destroy a bill whose purpose is to put people in jail who \nattack pregnant women and do damage to the mother and the child.\n  No good purpose is served by destroying this bill, even though the \nunderlying problem is very real. This bill should stand on its merits. \nThere are more cases such as this than we would all like to admit. We \nhave a chance to do something about it today. Please vote against \nSenator Murray's amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I yield to my colleague from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, to inform my colleague from Washington, \nat the appropriate time, when she concludes her statement, I plan on \nmaking a budget point of order.\n  First, I compliment my colleague, Senator Graham from South Carolina, \nfor his leadership on this issue for years. I believe today we are \ngoing to pass a bill that is long overdue.\n  I also compliment my colleague, Senator DeWine from Ohio, for his \nleadership.\n  I complimented him in private. I have observed his very high quality \nof debate. We have had some excellent debate today, and I compliment \nMembers\n\n[[Page S3162]]\n\non all sides. I think it has been very important and we are going to \npass a good bill today, largely due to the leadership of the Senator \nfrom Ohio, Mr. DeWine, and also Senator Graham of South Carolina. I \ncompliment both of our colleagues for their effort. This is an \nimportant bill, one that deserves to be passed and sent to the \nPresident.\n  I rise today to speak against the amendment of our colleague from \nWashington. I have great respect for our colleague from Washington, \nespecially for the title of the amendment. The Wellstone Domestic \nViolence Act is very well named, but when looking at the substance of \nthe bill I find it leaves a lot to be desired.\n  I happen to believe in the legislative process. This bill has not had \na hearing. I happen to be on the Finance Committee. There are two or \nthree things that deal with Finance Committee issues that we have not \ntouched. It did not go through the Labor Committee. It addresses family \nleave, not the Family Medical Leave Act. It is basically a whole new \nact. It is not consistent with the Family Medical Leave Act. To qualify \nfor the Family Medical Leave Act, we exempt employers with 50 employees \nor less. This says employers of 15 or less. That does not make sense to \nme.\n  I look at the unemployment section of it, and a lot of people are not \neven aware of this--I have not heard very much debate about this--but \nif a State does not comply with the unemployment dictates given by this \nbill we tell the States they must have unemployment compensation for \npeople who are victims of abuse as defined by this. The tax to the \nState goes from $56 a year to $434 a year. That is a 675-percent \nincrease. That is a heavy penalty on the States.\n  One could say, well, they give States time to amend their law. They \nare given 25 days if they are in session and 180 days if they are not \nin session. Oklahoma is shortly going to be out of session and we do \nnot go back into session for the rest of the year, so 180 days would \nnot be adequate. I guess there would have to be a special session. I \nused to serve in the Oklahoma Legislature. Most legislatures are kind \nof like Congress, they do not move that fast. If they do not move that \nfast, they have a very heavy penalty increase in their unemployment \ncompensation taxes.\n  The main thing I guess I am objecting to, as I look at it, there is a \nnew tax credit in this bill. It is a 40-percent tax credit for a \nprovision that is very expensive. It applies to a lot of things. It \napplies to a long definition that would qualify expenses that an \nemployer might incur to implement workplace safety.\n  I used to be an employer in the private sector, and I know all \nemployers are interested in safety. Almost all of those expenses \nrelated to safety are expensed. None of them, to my knowledge, get a \ntax credit. This amendment would say, for some safety provisions \nemployers are going to get a 40-percent tax credit.\n  Then I started looking at the definition. It applies to basically any \nnew security personnel, purchase, or installation of new security \nequipment and so on. That is wide open. In this day and age of \nterrorist threats, there are a lot of people who are going to be hiring \nmore security personnel and they are going to say: Thank you very much, \nGovernment, because you just gave us a 40-percent tax credit.\n  If a company is profitable, that is worth a lot. If they are not \nprofitable, it is not worth much.\n  I asked the Joint Tax Committee to give an estimate on how much this \nwould cost. I just received it. I ask unanimous consent that a letter I \nreceived from Dr. George Yin, that gives the revenue estimate, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                  Joint Committee on Taxation,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 23, 2004.\n     Hon. Don Nickles,\n     U.S. Senate, Committee on the Budget,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nickles: This letter is in response to your \n     request dated March 17, 2004, for a revenue estimate for \n     Senate amendment 2859, which according to your request may \n     come up for a vote on March 24, 2004, under a unanimous \n     consent agreement for H.R. 1997.\n       In general, the amendment would establish a new general \n     business tax credit equal to 40 percent of the domestic and \n     sexual violence safety and education cost paid or incurred by \n     an employer during the taxable year. Any amount taken into \n     account for purposes of determining the credit would not be \n     eligible for any other credit or deduction. Under the \n     amendment, the types of cost that may be included for \n     purposes of determining the amount of the credit include, \n     among other things, the hiring of new security personnel and \n     the purchase or installation of new security equipment, the \n     purpose of which is to address domestic or sexual violence. \n     Because the hiring of all new security personnel and the \n     purchase or installation of all new security equipment is, in \n     part, for the safety of employees, we have assumed that all \n     such expenditures would be eligible for the tax credit.\n       The amendment would apply to taxable years beginning after \n     December 31, 2003. Estimated changes in Federal fiscal year \n     budget receipts are as follows:\n\n                [By fiscal years in billions of dollars]\n\n2004...............................................................-0.6\n2005...............................................................-1.3\n2006...............................................................-1.5\n2007...............................................................-1.7\n2008...............................................................-1.8\n2009...............................................................-1.8\n2010...............................................................-1.9\n2011...............................................................-1.9\n2012...............................................................-1.9\n2013...............................................................-2.0\n2014...............................................................-2.0\n2004-09............................................................-8.7\n2004-14...........................................................-18.4\n\n       I hope this information is helpful to you. If we can be of \n     further assistance in this matter, please let me know.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    George K. Yin.\n  Mr. NICKLES. He says the cost of this provision in 5 years is \nestimated at $8.7 billion, and over 10 years, $18.4 billion.\n  That is a lot of money. We are going to say companies get a 40-\npercent tax credit if they do something in the realm of safety, which \none could almost drive a truck through anything and call it safety.\n  I am not a big fan of tax credits anyway, but that is beside the \npoint. This is a very expensive provision, one, in my opinion, that has \nnot been well thought out, one that is enormously expensive, one that \nis not paid for.\n  A week before last, we had votes saying we should be paying for these \nnew spending proposals and tax cuts. Well, this is a big tax cut that \nis not paid for. Frankly, it is a big loophole that is not paid for. It \nalso causes other little constitutional problems.\n  We have a Constitution that says all revenue measures have to \noriginate in the House. We do not have a tax bill before us. This did \nnot originate in the House of Representatives. I know my colleagues \nvery well in the House. I respect them and I know they will blue-slip \nthis if this amendment is passed because this would turn this into a \ntax bill. So this amendment would kill this bill.\n  Our colleagues in the House want to pass the bill as it is. I hope \nthat a majority in the Senate want to pass the bill as it is.\n  As it is, this amendment does a couple of things. It increases \nspending and it increases taxes, both of which violate the budget, both \nof which I can make a budget point of order against, and at the \nappropriate time I will make a budget point of order against this \namendment, certainly for the tax provision, and I will leave it at \nthat.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n         MURRAY AMENDMENT TO THE UNBORN VICTIMS OF VIOLENCE ACT\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I support Senator Murray's amendment, and \nI want my colleagues to support it too. Violence against women--\nespecially those who are pregnant--is a tragic example of violence in \nour society, and we need to do all we can to prevent it. Congress is \nright to address this issue and do more to protect women. But if the \nadministration and Congress are serious about addressing the issue of \ndomestic violence, let us do it effectively, and not turn it into yet \nanother battleground in the debate over abortion.\n  As domestic violence experts and advocates make clear, the Unborn \nVictims of Violence Act will do nothing to provide the protection that \nbattered women need to be safe. Instead of protecting women, the bill \nfocuses solely on the fetus and what happens after the crime.\n  It does nothing to prevent domestic violence, and it punishes only \none of the many possible consequences of such violence.\n\n[[Page S3163]]\n\n  The harm to women at the hands of their abusers and attackers is not \naddressed anywhere in this bill. The support and services they need to \navoid violence in their homes or escape from it are not addressed. It \noffers no financial safety net for women who move away from their homes \nto escape from abusers. It does not address children affected by the \nabuse. It offers no health care assistance for abused women.\n  The real purpose of this bill is obviously not to protect and support \nwomen who are victims of abuse. Its real purpose is to give new legal \nrights to the fetus, in a blatant effort to undermine women's rights \nunder the Constitution and Roe v. Wade. In other words, this bill is a \nthreat to women, not a protection for them.\n  Proponents of this measure also call it the Laci Peterson Act, but \nthis bill would have done nothing to prevent that tragedy. Federal \ncriminal jurisdiction over violent crimes is very limited. The bill \nwould apply only to federal and military crimes. It would have no \nbearing on the law of California or any other State. Today, 95 percent \nof all criminal prosecutions, like the prosecution of Laci Peterson's \nmurderer, take place at the State or local level.\n  A majority of States already have laws that enable prosecutors to \nfile fetal homicide charges. In Massachusetts, the courts have treated \nthe fetus as a separate victim of crime if the developing fetus has \nreached the stage of viability. That view is consistent with the \ncareful balance between women's rights and fetal rights established by \nthe Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade and reaffirmed in Planned Parenthood \nv. Casey. This bill completely ignores the Supreme Court's viability \nstandard.\n  In cases where federal law or military law applies, prosecutors and \njudges already have ample discretion to impose longer sentences for \nflagrant crimes committed against vulnerable victims. Courts have \nregularly held that the Federal Sentencing Guidelines provide for a \nsentencing enhancement based on the victim's pregnancy or injury to a \nfetus. The military also makes clear that the pregnancy of the victim \ncan lead to a harsher sentence.\n  The administration says it wants to prevent violence against women \nand children. But that priority is not reflected in the budget. The \nPresident's budget is cutting or starving key violence-prevention \nprograms.\n  If Congress genuinely intends to do more to prevent such tragedies, \nwe should be discussing ways to strengthen the Violence Against Women \nAct and its funding.\n  Since its enactment in 1994, violence against women has been reduced \nby 21 percent, so we are clearly making progress. We are on the right \ntrack, and there's no excuse for making a u-turn.\n  The most urgent priority is the need for additional funds. The \nservices available today to victims of domestic violence come nowhere \nclose to meeting the obvious need. The New England Learning Center for \nWomen in Transition in Greenfield, MA, has to turn away ten families \nfrom its shelter for each family it is able to serve. Life-saving \nservices such as hotlines and emergency shelters for battered women are \nfunded $48 million below the level authorized by Congress. Women across \nthe country are not obtaining the help they need when they face these \ndangers or suffer from them. We can do far more than we are doing to \nsee that women do not suffer from domestic violence.\n  Senator Murray's amendment will do that. Unlike the underlying bill, \nher proposal will genuinely help to combat the serious problem of \ndomestic violence in our country.\n  Incredible as it seems, nearly one-third of all American women report \nbeing physically or sexually abused by their husbands or boyfriends at \nsome time in their lives. A shocking 25 percent to 40 percent of all \nwomen who are battered are battered when they are pregnant. One study \nfound that 37 percent of all women who visited a hospital emergency \nroom for violence-related injuries were injured by a current or former \nhusband or boyfriend. According to a study published in the Journal of \nthe American Medical Association, murder is actually the leading cause \nof death among pregnant women.\n  Over 3 million children are exposed to parental violence in the \nUnited States every year. According to a report of the American \nPsychological Association, a young boy who sees his father abusing his \nmother is the strongest risk factor for future violent behavior by that \nchild.\n  Far from preventing such violence, the so-called Unborn Victims of \nViolence Act will actually prevent victims of abuse from seeking help. \nJuley Fulcher, Public Policy Director of the National Coalition Against \nDomestic Violence, testified before the House Subcommittee on the \nConstitution last July. She said that if a battered woman is \nfinancially or emotionally dependent on her batterer, she is less \nlikely to seek medical assistance if she thinks it may result in the \ncriminal prosecution of her batterer.\n  The underlying bill contains none of these urgently needed \nprotections for battered women. The Murray amendment will give them the \nsecurity and support they need to leave an abusive relationship before \nit's too late.\n  According to a GAO report in 1998, between a quarter and a half of \ndomestic violence victims report that they lost their job at least \npartly because of domestic violence. A victim who was forced to change \nher name and Social Security number in order to escape her abuser \ntestified before the Massachusetts Commission on Domestic Violence. She \nsaid that when she met with the human resources officers at her \nworkplace to explain why she needed help, she lost her job because they \nthought her abuser might attack her in the office and be a safety \nthreat to her co-workers too. Victims of domestic violence need job \nstability. They need economic independence in order to leave their \nabuser.\n  Without a viable source of income, victims to often have no way to \nescape from their abusive relationship.\n  Senator Murray's amendment helps these victims by guaranteeing them \naccess to emergency leave to obtain medical attention, counseling or \nother services without fear of losing their job. It provides \nunemployment compensation. It supports the specific training for \nmedical providers to recognize the signs of abuse, so that frightened \nwomen who arrive in the emergency room with tell-tale bruises will know \nthat help is available and will be more likely to reveal and seek the \nfurther support they recall is available.\n  It will ensure that children who witness violence in the home will \nreceive the help they need in order to break the tragic cycle of \nviolence before it consumes the next generation in their families too.\n  We need laws that genuinely protect women in all of these ways, as \nSenator Murray's amendment will do. And it does so without undermining \na woman's fundamental right to choose.\n  The Murray amendment provides long and overdue support to victims, \nemployers, public health professionals and families to combat violence \nagainst women, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I think we are about ready to close this out.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, if my colleagues on the other side are \ngoing to yield back, I will take a couple of minutes to wrap up. I know \nmy colleagues want to get to the vote and final passage, so I will take \nonly a few minutes to end the debate on this amendment.\n  I have listened carefully to the other side. They raised concerns \nabout the tax credit side of it, and the budget point of order. I asked \nunanimous consent to send an amendment to the desk to at least move the \nother parts of the bill forward without the objectionable part and they \nrefused. That says to me that, despite the rhetoric we have heard from \nthe other side, they are not very willing to do something truly about \npreventing domestic violence.\n  I have heard my colleagues on the other side of the aisle say the \nreality of this place is that if this amendment gets added that it will \nkill the bill. I have been in the Senate almost 12 years and I know the \nreality of this place is when Members believe in something and want to \nsolve a problem we can move mountains to get it done.\n  To the millions of women across this country who have been victims of \ndomestic violence, what they are going to\n\n[[Page S3164]]\n\nsee on the Senate floor today is Senators being allowed the opportunity \nto say whether they are actually going to do something to prevent \ndomestic violence or if Senators are only willing to deal with domestic \nviolence after the woman has died.\n  I believe we have the responsibility to do everything we can to \nprevent domestic violence. I hope the bill Senators are putting forward \ntoday never has to be used because we have prevented violence, but the \nfact is they are going to prevent us today from offering an amendment \nthat would preclude the underlying bill from ever having to be used. I \nthink that is a tragedy. I think it is a tragedy for the Senate. I \nthink it is a tragedy for the country. I certainly think it is a \ntragedy for women who face abuse every single day.\n  Two million women are assaulted every year. I introduced this bill \nwith my colleague Senator Paul Wellstone 3 years ago. We introduced it \nin three consecutive Congresses and the other side has not allowed us \nto bring it forward. I keep hearing that we have not had hearings on \nit. Well, we would love to have hearings on it. We would love to move \nforward, but it is always said that the time is never right. That is \ncertainly something victims of abuse hear far too often.\n  This bill simply allows women the time to be able to go to court to \nget a court order to prevent their abuser from tracking them down and \nkilling them. It allows them the ability to make sure that children who \nhave seen domestic violence get the kind of help they need so they do \nnot create a cycle of violence in their lives, which we know happens \ntoo often. It makes sure we offer health care to victims of domestic \nviolence. These are victims who are still alive and need help. It makes \nsure our health care providers screen for domestic violence so we do \nnot end up with murdered victims every single day. Not relevant? The \nChamber of Commerce says this is unrelated? How can anyone look in the \neye a woman who has been abused by a batterer and tell her we are not \ngoing to help you until you are gone, until you die? I think that is a \nreal tragedy. I am sorry my colleagues on the other side see it that \nway. I don't.\n\n  I have heard rhetoric out here from some of my colleagues--and I do \nwant to commend the Senator from Ohio. He has worked on this issue. I \ndo want to work with you. But I find it a tragedy today that, again, \nthe time is not right. That is what women who are victims of domestic \nviolence hear every single day: The time is not right. We can't help \nyou today. That is what we are doing today. I find that a tragedy.\n  I am going to continue to work on this issue. I know my colleagues on \nthe other side are going to defeat it today. I know they are going to \nmove on. They have other issues they are going to deal with. But this \nissue is critical. I have been to the shelters; I have looked the women \nin the eyes; I have promised them I will not forget, and I will not.\n  This amendment is named after Senator Paul Wellstone. Every one of us \nhere know he and Sheila cared and were adamant that we provide victims \nof abuse with the ability to get out of their abusive situation. I hope \nmy colleagues will continue to work with us and that the rhetoric we \nhave heard on the other side about working with us is not forgotten \nwhen this bill is gone.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I commend my colleague again for her dedication to this \nissue, and her passion. But the fact is, as I have said, this bill \ncannot pass through this method. It will have the unintended effect of \nkilling the underlying bill. That is why I must come to the floor and \noppose it.\n  Let me yield the remainder of my time to my colleague from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, is all time yielded back from our \ncolleague from Washington?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, this bill has a big tax provision that is \nestimated to cost $18.4 billion. Therefore, a budget point of order \ndoes lie against this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, the pending amendment offered by our \ncolleague from Washington, Mrs. Murray, decreases revenues and if \nadopted would cause an increase in the deficit in excess of the levels \npermitted in the most recent budget resolution. Therefore, I raise a \npoint of order against the amendment pursuant to section 505 of House \ncurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2004.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, pursuant to section 505(b) of H. Con. \nRes. 95 of the 108th Congress, I move to waive the Budget Act.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry) \nis necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would vote ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to engage the distinguished \nSenator from South Carolina, Senator Graham, in a brief colloquy in \norder to make clear the intent behind the language in this bill. It is \nmy understanding that there is nothing in the language of this bill \nthat would, in any way, undermine the constitutional right of a woman \nto choose to terminate a pregnancy, as expressed by the Supreme Court \nin Roe v. Wade, and subsequent decisions.\n  I inquire of the Senator, who is one of the coauthors of the bill, if \nmy understanding of the intent behind the language in the bill is \ncorrect.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The Senator from Maine is correct. Nothing in the \nlanguage of this bill is intended in any way to undermine the legal \nbasis for abortion rights, as expressed by the Supreme Court in Roe v. \nWade, and subsequent decisions.\n  Based on my extensive experience as a prosecutor in the U.S. Air \nForce, this legislation would, however, fill a gap in our Federal laws.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, it is also my understanding that at least \n27 States have statutes that criminalize the killing of a fetus or an \n``unborn\n\n[[Page S3165]]\n\nchild.'' Am I correct in understanding that there is no legal precedent \nwhere a court has held that any of these State statues in any way \nundermine abortion rights of a woman, as expressed by the Supreme Court \nin Roe v. Wade, and subsequent decisions?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The Senator from Maine is correct. There is no legal \nprecedent where a court has concluded that any of these State statutes \nundermines the legal basis for abortion rights.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I have one final inquiry I would like to \nmake of my colleague. It is my understanding that the intent behind the \nlanguage of this bill, H.R. 1997, is that this bill, like those State \nlaws, not be construed to undermine the legal basis for abortion \nrights.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The Senator from Maine is correct.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank my colleague for making the intent in this \nrespect clear.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nUnborn Victims of Violence Act. I firmly believe that we need this \nlegislation to correct the loophole in federal law that currently does \nnothing to criminalize violent acts against unborn children. Sadly, we \nlive in a violent world where unborn babies are the victims, intended \nor otherwise, of violent acts. I find this horrifying, and believe that \nall children, born or unborn, are a precious gift and responsibility.\n  This is something we have already recognized in Ohio. I am proud to \nsay that we got this done on my watch when I was Governor of Ohio. In \nJune 1996, I signed legislation making it a crime to injure or kill a \nprenatal child who could survive on his or her own outside the mother's \nwomb. We passed this legislation in record time due to public outcry \nover a case in Indian Hill, a suburb of Cincinnati in 1995. Joseph \nDaly's wife and her unborn baby were killed in a car accident when a \ndrunk driver hit her car. People were outraged that action could be \nbrought on behalf of Mrs. Daly, but not their unborn daughter, who was \n2 weeks away from being born. And people will be outraged.\n  Under current Federal law, an individual who commits a Federal crime \nof violence and kills or injures an unborn child cannot be prosecuted \nseparately for those violent acts against the unborn child because \nFederal criminal law does not recognize the unborn child as a crime \nvictim. Can you imagine? A baby that could be viable outside of its \nmother's womb would not be considered a crime victim? This bill will \nclose that gap.\n  Under this bill, if an unborn child is injured or killed during the \ncommission of a Federal crime of violence, the assailant could be \ncharged with a separate offense on behalf of the unborn child. In 29 \nStates, including Ohio, if a person commits a crime of violence against \na pregnant woman under State law and kills or injures her unborn child, \nthat person can be punished for the violence against both the mother \nand the unborn child. But if a person commits a Federal crime of \nviolence against a pregnant woman and injures or kills her unborn baby, \nthe death or injury of the unborn child would not be punished as a \ncrime.\n  This bill extends the protections currently available in 29 States to \nthe unborn victims of violent acts committed in violation of Federal \nlaw. Thus, where a Federal crime of violence has been committed and the \ninjury or death of an unborn child results, the perpetrator will be \nheld to account for the crime of violence against the unborn child.\n  I know some of my colleagues will want to paint this as an abortion \nissue. But, it is important to note that this bill has been drafted \nnarrowly to apply only where the death or injury to the unborn baby \noccurs as a result of an existing Federal crime. The bill expressly \nexcludes any death or injury to an unborn baby caused by abortion, any \nmedical treatment of the mother, or an act of the mother herself.\n  As I stated before, we live in a violent world where unborn babies \nare the victims, intended or otherwise, of violent acts. And these \nbabies, the smallest and most helpless victims, deserve justice, too. \nWe must pass this legislation and take a stand against crimes committed \nagainst women and children. I therefore ask my colleagues to support \nthis very important legislation.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for the \nUnborn Victims of Violence Act.\n  Any pregnant woman will tell you that all she wants is for her baby \nto be born healthy. A pregnant mother can take her vitamins, follow the \ninstructions of her doctor, and do everything in her power to deliver a \nhealthy baby. But, no amount of prenatal care can protect her unborn \nchild from the hands of a violent criminal.\n  This question before us is simply--when a violent crime is committed \nagainst a pregnant woman--is there one victim or two? Pregnant women \nwho have been harmed by criminal violence and their families know that \nthere are two victims.\n  In a letter to the sponsors of this bill, the family of Laci and \nConner Peterson, whose lives were brutally ended, requested that the \nbill before us today be referred to as ``Laci and Conner's Law in their \nmemory.'' The Peterson family can, better than any of us, express the \nimpact of this terrible loss. They wrote, ``As the family of Laci \nPeterson and her unborn son, Conner, this bill is very close to our \nhearts. We have not only lost our future with our daughter and sister, \nbut with our grandson and nephew as well.'' No one can tell the \nPeterson family that there was only one victim. The Peterson family \nmourns for two lives that were brutally ended. There is no question \nthat the criminal responsible should be accountable for the loss of \nboth lives.\n  When pregnant women suffer at the hands of violent criminals I urge \nmy colleagues to protect both victims under Federal law.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Unborn \nVictims of Violence Act, or what many individuals refer to as ``Laci \nand Conner's Law.''\n  We have all heard the tragic story of Laci and Conner Peterson; Laci, \n8 months pregnant with her unborn son Conner, were viciously murdered \nat the hands of a killer. Regrettably, Laci and Conner's story is only \none of many instances where a woman is harmed and may not only lose her \nlife but the life of her unborn child.\n  In my Commonwealth of Virginia, we had a similar tragic situation \noccur in April of 2002. Ronda Robinson was maliciously gunned down in \nher Lynchburg home, while her two daughters watched in terror. Like \nLaci, Ronda was in her third trimester when she and her unborn child \nhad their lives taken.\n  At that time, Virginia did not have a fetal homicide law on the \nbooks, and the Commonwealth was unable to bring a homicide charge \nagainst the murderer for the killing of Ronda's unborn child.\n  Unfortunately, the situation in Virginia and many other States \nremains the same. If a mother survives an assault, but loses her unborn \nchild, the law currently does not recognize any loss of any human life \nat all.\n  However, I am pleased that the Virginia General Assembly has taken \nsteps to correct this wrong. This year, the Virginia General Assembly \noverwhelmingly passed legislation that would hold an individual \naccountable who, ``unlawfully, willfully, deliberately, maliciously, \nand with premeditation kills the fetus of another.'' Twenty-Nine \nsenators or 72 percent of the senate and 77 members of the house of \ndelegates or 77 percent of the house supported this legislation.\n  While this legislation has not yet been signed into law, I am hopeful \nthat Virginia will follow the lead of the 29 other States that have \npassed this important and meaningful legislation.\n  I have the same optimism for the Unborn Victims of Violence Act. We \nhave a chance to hear the voice of the voiceless and bring fairness to \na system that has essentially told hundreds of women and their \nfamilies, their unborn child never existed.\n  I have been blessed with four great gifts, my loving wife and my \nthree wonderful children. I have witnessed my children grow and live \nhealthy and happy lives. I see what my children have accomplished so \nfar in their lives and I am eager to see what other great \naccomplishments will follow. But many individuals are unable to witness \nthe birth and growth of their child because of a violent criminal act.\n  Throughout my tenure in public service, whether it was in the \nVirginia\n\n[[Page S3166]]\n\nHouse of Delegates, U.S. House of Representatives, Governor's office, \nor now in the U.S. Senate, I have always tried to be tough on \ncriminals. I have always believed in the principle that if you commit a \ncrime, you should be punished.\n  The Unborn Victims of Violence Act closely upholds my beliefs by \nmaking criminals accountable for their actions. Under current Federal \nlaw, an individual who commits a Federal crime of violence and kills or \ninjures an unborn child cannot be prosecuted for those violent acts \nagainst the unborn child. The Unborn Victims of Violence Act seeks to \nrectify this situation and close that loophole.\n  Under this bill, if an unborn child is injured or killed during the \ncommission of an already-defined Federal crime of violence, then the \nassailant could be charged with a separate offense for the second, \nenhanced crime upon the unborn child.\n  Opponents of the Unborn Victims of Violence Act contend that this \nwill hamper a woman's right to choose and constitute an attack on Roe \nv. Wade. This is simply false. In fact, this legislation explicitly \nprovides that it does not apply to any abortion to which a woman has \nconsented, to any act of the mother herself, legal or illegal, or to \nany form of medical treatment.\n  In addition, opponents have brought numerous challenges against State \nunborn victims laws, based on Roe and other constitutional arguments, \nand all of these challenges have been rejected by State and Federal \ncourts.\n  I have always been a strong supporter of rights of the people in the \nStates to determine their laws so long as it does not harm interstate \ncommerce or our Constitution. This bill safeguards those States' laws. \nThis legislation does not supersede State unborn victims laws, nor does \nit impose such a law in a State that does not have one on the books. \nThe Unborn Victims of Violence Act merely applies to an already defined \nset of Federal crimes.\n  The bottom line is that criminals must be held accountable for their \nactions. The Unborn Victims of Violence Act ensures that justice is \nsought and available for the totality of the violent murderous act. \nThis is good, solid legislation that is tough on crime, appropriately \npunishes criminals, and meets the ends of justice desired by law-\nabiding citizens.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill so that we can send it to \nPresident Bush for his signature and ensure that justice will be \nserved.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I share the outrage of every other Member in \nthis Senate over the heinous and violent crimes that are committed \nagainst over 300,000 women a year. These crimes are especially horrific \nwhen the perpetrator knows his victim and knows her to be pregnant.\n  Today, a significant number of States already allowed stricter \npenalties for crimes of violence committed against pregnant women. At \nthe Federal level, I believe that it is appropriate and necessary to \nconform our Federal laws to the statutes of these States.\n  Particularly heinous crimes ought to receive particularly harsh \npenalties. And for that reason, I strongly supported the Feinstein \namendment during today's debate. Like the underlying legislation, the \nFeinstein amendment would have allowed Federal prosecutors to ``double-\ncharge'' those individuals convicted of crimes against pregnant women, \nand would have set forth severe and just punishments for those crimes. \nUnfortunately, this amendment was defeated.\n  I also realize that punishing individuals for crimes against women, \nboth pregnant and not, is only one step toward reducing domestic \nviolence. We must do more as a society not only to punish but to \nprevent domestic violence. For this reason, I strongly supported the \nMurray amendment today. This amendment would have protected the \neconomic security of women who are victims of domestic violence by \nallowing them to keep their jobs if and when they needed to take time \noff to attend court and receive medical care related to an act of \ndomestic violence committed against them. It would have also authorized \nimportant new initiatives for the establishment of family violence \nresearch and education centers to develop, implement, disseminate, and \nevaluate family violence prevention and early intervention services and \nstrategies. Again, I was disappointed when this amendment failed.\n  We have come a long way from the days when domestic violence was \nconsidered a private matter. Major initiatives like the Violence \nAgainst Women Act have offered protection for women while treating \ndomestic violence for what it is--crimes committed by cowards. However, \nas the continued prevalence of domestic violence cases show, we have a \nlong way to go.\n  Regrettably, the underlying bill that was before us today is not \nprincipally focused on curbing violence and punishing those individuals \nfound guilty of committing these heinous crimes. Rather, the \nlegislation was focused on advocating a cause about which its \nproponents feel very deeply, but a cause that a majority of Americans \ndo not share--the cause of eroding and ultimately ending women's right \nto choose.\n  I happen to support a woman's right to choose as set forth in the Roe \nvs. Wade decision. And I find it regrettable and inappropriate that \nlegislation that ought to be focused on eroding the number of heinous \ncrimes committed against all women focuses instead on eroding a woman's \nright to choose. For this reason, while I supported both the Feinstein \nand Murray amendments, I am unable to support the underlying bill.\n  For those who wish to advocate a cause not related to the issue of \ndomestic violence, I urge them to advocate it in the open and not by \nstealth. But for those who want to reduce further the number and \nseverity of crimes against women to continue working with people like \nSenators Feinstein and Murray. Working together, I am confident we can \nmake a substantial difference in the lives of hundreds of thousands of \nwomen across the country.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the Unborn \nVictims of Violence Act and our duty to protect the most innocent among \nus.\n  A woman becomes a mother the moment she hears she is with child. From \nthat time forward, her primary concern is providing for and protecting \nthe new life within. Our concerns should be no different.\n  It is horrifying that an expectant mother could be the target of \nviolence--yet it happens. And when such a crime is committed, there is \nnot one victim, but two. Recognizing this fact in Federal law not only \nfulfills our commitment to mothers and the unborn, it also serves as a \ndeterrent to crimes against the innocent.\n  Under the laws of 29 States, if a person commits a violent crime \nagainst a pregnant woman and seriously injures or kills her unborn \nchild, that assailant can be punished for both the violence against the \nmother and the unborn child. This is not the case in federal law. A \nperpetrator who commits a violent crime under Federal jurisdiction and \nkills an unborn child cannot be prosecuted for that death. This is \nwrong.\n  Today, I am proud to join my colleagues in voting in favor of the \nUnborn Victims of Violence Act. Under this legislation, an assailant \nwho commits a Federal crime and kills or injures an unborn child can be \ncharged with a separate offense on behalf of the child. Passage of this \nbill sends an immediate message to criminals that they will be punished \nfor violence against women and their unborn children.\n  This legislation and the ban on partial-birth abortion enacted last \nyear further protect the sanctity of life. Like the ban on partial-\nbirth abortions, this bill is supported by the vast majority of \nAmericans who recognize it as a reasonable stop we can take to protect \nwomen and children.\n  I look forward to President Bush signing this legislation into law. \nIt will show criminals that they can no longer act with impunity and it \nwill tell expectant parents what they already know--that their unborn \nchildren have value, too.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I am prepared to yield back our time on the general \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is still time on the underlying bill.\n  The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. We yield back on the minority side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, since the tragic events of September 11, \nwe have all strived mightily to ensure that our great homeland is never \nsubjected to a terrorist attack by the evildoers again. But everyday \nthose very evildoers weaken the fabric of our country, their enemy, by \nflooding our great society with addictive and deadly drugs. While the \nlink between terrorists and drugs has been made countless times \npublically, we, as a Nation, have yet to attack the problem with an \napproach that is consistent and successful.\n  On March 13, 2002, Rand Beers, Assistant Secretary for International \nNarcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, and Francis Taylor, Ambassador-\nat-large for Counterterrorism, made the points in joint testimony \nprepared for a hearing on ``Narco-Terror: The Worldwide Connection \nBetween Drugs and Terror'' held by the Judiciary Committee Subcommittee \non Technology, Terrorism and Government Information. Taylor, who \ndelivered the opening testimony, told us that ``relations between drug \ntraffickers and terrorists benefit both.''\n  ``Drug traffickers benefit from the terrorists' military skills, \nweapons supply, and access to clandestine organizations. Terrorists \ngain a source of revenue and expertise in illicit transfer and \nlaundering of proceeds from illicit transactions,'' he said.\n  Taylor listed terrorist groups with known links to drug trafficking \naround the world--from the South American nations of Colombia, Peru, \nBolivia and Paraguay to Afghanistan, which, he said, accounts for more \nthan 70 percent of the world's supply of opiates.\n  Mr. President, we know that 12 of the 25 major terror organizations \nidentified by the State Department in 2002 have ties to drug \ntraffickers and we know that drugs are a major source of funding for \nthese terrorist groups. We know these groups sometimes work as \nconspirators to carry out their evil purposes.\n  The Lebanese Hezbollah group is increasingly involved in drug \ntrafficking and terrorist organizations in Europe and Southeast Asia \nalso are tied to illicit drugs.\n  The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, commonly known as the \nFARC, protects cocaine laboratories and clandestine airstrips in \nsouthern Colombia and some FARC units directly control local cocaine \nbase markets.\n  As evidence that terrorist groups cooperate and work together, the \nColombian National Police arrested three members of the IRA in July, \n2001, who are believed to have used the demilitarized zone to train the \nFARC in the use of explosives.\n  While we know these connections, we have not taken full advantage of \nthe vast resources and knowledge available to exploit this connection. \nThe link between terrorism and drug trafficking that may take many \nforms, ranging from facilitation--protection, transportation, and \ntaxation--to direct trafficking by the terrorist organization itself in \norder to finance its activities. Traffickers and terrorists have many \nof the same needs in terms of the secret movement of goods, people \nand money.\n\n  There are no swans in the sewer, and the relationships between drug \ntraffickers and terrorists benefit both. As Mr. Beers stated, ``Drug \ntraffickers benefit from the terrorists' military skills, weapons \nsupply, and access to clandestine organizations. Terrorists gain a \nsource of revenue and expertise [from drug traffickers] in illicit \ntransfer and laundering of proceeds from illicit transactions.'' \nCorrupt officials who are influenced by the dirty money of the narco-\nterrorists make it easier for the groups to get access to fraudulent \ndocuments, including passports and travel documents. This allows the \nterrorists to travel abroad under the stealth and protection of a \nshadowy network that is virtually undetectable.\n  Terrorists and drug traffickers also use the same methods to hide \ntheir illegal profits and conduct fundraising to feed their evil plans. \nThe schemes used by the terrorists for the transferring and laundering \nof drug money for general criminal purposes are similar to those used \nto move money to support terrorist activities. The use of ``charities'' \nand informal networks such as ``hawalas'' are easy and efficient ways \nto launder money.\n  Yet these are the only methods we know about. Congress is in the \nprocess\n\n[[Page S3168]]\n\nof crafting a budget for the 2005 fiscal year. We have some tough \nchoices ahead of us. But as we move forward, I would urge my colleagues \nto keep in mind the lessons we have learned in our efforts to go after \ndrug trafficking organizations.\n  First, to be successful, we need the assistance of other nations. \nThough many countries have been quick to update their regulations, few \nhave the law enforcement structure in place to carry out interdiction. \nLaw enforcement capabilities must improve globally. In addition, \ncommunication between law enforcement agencies nationally and \ninternationally, must become seamless in order to rapidly and \neffectively identify, target and eradicate terrorists and their drug \ntrafficking brothers before they eradicate us.\n  Second, our various law enforcement efforts within the United States \nmust be coordinated. As our efforts to catch drug traffickers have \ntaught us, no one agency has all of the tools, information, resources \nor skills to get the job done alone. Encouraging interagency \ncooperation, then, must be a priority.\n  And third, the efforts made at the State and local level to go after \ndrug traffickers are also an important piece of our war on terror. We \ncannot, should not, and must not, overlook the efforts and expertise of \nour State and local law enforcement officers. They know best what's \ngoing on in their communities and often have the best, most effective \napproach to stem the flow of crime within their borders.\n  I will say more about the links between drug trafficking and \nterrorism in the future. But the connection is there and should not be \nignored. Whether we discuss the financing or smuggling by terrorists, \ndocument fraud or corruption by drug traffickers, the sewer where the \nindividuals bent on these activities dwell needs to be cleaned up. \nLet's not overlook the other filth in the water just because the sewer \nrat floats by.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/25/senate-section/article/S3168-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3168-S3169]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         A STEW POT OF TROUBLE\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I think we have a bubbling stew pot of \ntrouble brewing in Afghanistan, and we need to take stronger action \naction requested by President Karzai, by the way--soon, or much of our \neffort to root out lawlessness in Afghanistan may be undercut.\n  What am I talking about? Narcotics--particularly about the \nsignificant increase in opium production and trafficking in \nAfghanistan. I am not challenging the significant progress which has \nbeen made in the past 2 years. Removing the Taliban and preparing the \ngroundwork for a democratically elected government is no small feat. \nWorking with our allies, we have gathered all of the right ingredients \ntogether to build a new Afghanistan that will benefit everyone--\nparticularly the people of Afghanistan. But the outcome is far from \ncertain, and it doesn't seem as if we are paying enough attention to \nthe danger signs.\n  According to the latest International Narcotics Control Strategy \nReport, released by the State Department at the beginning of this \nmonth, Afghanistan had the potential to produce 2,865 metric tons of \nopium in 2003. This represents almost two-thirds of the total potential \nopium production in the world. We know the havoc that drug use creates \nin a society. We know the corruption that drug trafficking encourages \nwhereever it occurs. Experience has shown us that ignoring drug \nproduction and trafficking has only made things worse. These factors \nalone should be a reason for concern.\n  We should also be concerned about who is profiting from this \nresurgence. The difference between what the Afghan farmer is getting \nand what an eightball of heroin is worth on the streets of Paris is \nastronomical. And I am certain those reaping this enormous profit are \nnot the same individuals who support the Karzai government, or who are \nhappy to see coalition troops there.\n  The profits and instability that follow drug production wherever it \noccurs should be raising alarms for everyone involved. What is most \nworrisome, however, is we have seen these ingredients thrown together \nbefore, in Colombia. We can go down that same road, or we can take \naction now, before events boil over into chaos.\n  Earlier this week I spoke on this floor about the connections between \ndrug trafficking and terrorism. The clearest nexus between drug \ntrafficking and terrorism is in Colombia, where there are three major \nterrorist organizations using drugs to fund their efforts to overthrow \nthe government.\n  The State Department has designated these three groups, the \nRevolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, FARC, the National Liberation \nArmy, ELN, and the United Self-Defense Groups of Colombia, AUC, as \nForeign Terrorist Organizations. But these terrorist organizations \nbegan with more ideological roots, and more localized objectives.\n  Together, these three terrorist organizations have killed thousands \nof innocents. Three American civilians are currently being held hostage \nby the FARC, and have not been allowed any contact with the outside \nworld for over a year.\n  For nearly 40 years the FARC have been pressing a pro-Marxist \nideology. Similarly, the ELN held a more Maoist philosophy, but also \nstrove for the same revolutionary objective. Initially these efforts \nwere supported by donations from both the Soviet Union and Cuba. But \nthat support ended with the fall of the Soviet Union.\n  While not as old, the AUC began as a series of para-military groups \ninitially funded by the wealthy landlords in Colombia. These groups, \ninitially endorsed by the government, were created because the \ngovernment was unable to protect these rural landlords from attacks by \nthe guerrillas.\n  But the end of the cold war did not mean an end to the guerrilla \nactivities in Colombia. Instead, all three of these organizations were \nable to turn to the narcotics trade for funding. Because of this, their \nmembership and the violence associated with each of these organizations \nhas increased dramatically. It is now estimated that these groups \nreceive a significant portion of their operating revenues from \nnarcotics.\n\n  With that move, much of the ideology and even the pretense of being a \nguerrilla group disappeared as well. At first, they just provided \nsecurity and other support to the drug lords and were paid for their \nservices. But that was not enough.\n  Today we know that both the AUC and the FARC fight each other for \naccess to the best smuggling routes into and out of Colombia. They \nfight the government to protect their drug production and \ntransportation networks. They have also begun reaching out to foreign \nterrorist organizations as well, using narcotics as currency in \nexchange for guns and training.\n  Until recently, these terrorist organizations were able to move \nfreely throughout a significant portion of rural Colombia, forcing the \ndisplacement of millions of Colombians as they battled the government \nand each other over drugs and politics. Only after coming to the \nconclusion that both drug trafficking and terrorism must be addressed \nequally has there been progress in restoring the control of Colombia to \nthe legitimate government.\n  Fast forward to Afghanistan. Like the FARC, there are groups within \nAfghanistan, primarily operating in the remote areas of the country, \nwho for ideological reasons would like to overthrow the government. The \nTaliban is perhaps the best known, but there are others as well. \nNumerous warlords also operate throughout the countryside, some whom \nhave even had the blessing of the government.\n  The Taliban, like the FARC after the fall of the Soviet Union, need \nto secure an alternative means of financing their operations if they \nare to survive. Our success in choking off their traditional funding \nsources has created this necessity. Opium--like coca for the FARC--is \nan easy, local, and available opportunity to do exactly that, and will \nnot be a new source of revenue for the Taliban. While the Taliban \nbanned opium production for a period of time when they controlled \nAfghanistan, they also taxed the trafficking and resulting profits from \nthe sale of stored opium after the ban.\n  Add to this equation some of the many warlords that control various \nareas of Afghanistan. Some of these warlords even worked with coalition \nforces to oust the Taliban. But most have no intention of surrendering \nany\n\n[[Page S3169]]\n\nof their power or authority to the central government in Kabul, \npreferring to fight for their own fiefdoms.\n  They have no interest in enforcing edicts from Kabul, or in taking \nany action that might give the central government additional \nlegitimacy. Profits from opium production and trafficking are a key \nmethod for continuing to fund their war clan.\n  These efforts are not as blatant or as well organized as what we have \nin Colombia today, but the ingredients are there. It is time we start \nconnecting the dots.\n  Today, several thousand U.S. and coalition soldiers are hunting down \nterrorists. These terrorists are receiving physical and financial \nsupport from somewhere. Meanwhile, the Karzai government is working \nfuriously to establish the police, judicial, and military systems \nnecessary to ensure that the people of Afghanistan can equitably govern \nthemselves. But they must overcome the chaos created by 20 years of \noccupation and civil war. The last thing that they need is a well \nfunded rebellion in their backyard.\n  The Karzai government recognizes the dangers posed by bumper crops of \nopium. They know the profits being generated by this drug production go \nnot to the Afghani people, but to the few powerful enough to move the \nopium out of Afghanistan. These drug traffickers flourish in the same \nkind of lawless environment where terrorists train.\n  We need to start connecting the dots. We cannot continue to separate \nterrorism and narco-trafficking. I fear that if the United States \nnarcotics policy in Afghanistan does not catch up to that of the Karzai \ngovernment, we will be facing the same mess that we are working to \nclean up in Colombia. We have watched this pot before. We need to begin \nlooking at our options now, before it boils over and we have a real \nmess.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss a draft legislative \nproposal I have developed and am soliciting comment from people in my \nState to add 160,000 acres of new wilderness in the Mount Hood National \nForest.\n  The year 2004 is momentous for wilderness in Oregon. It marks the \n40th anniversary of the 1964 Wilderness Act and the 20th anniversary of \nthe last Oregon wilderness bill. Perhaps most importantly, 2004 marks \nthe bicentennial of the single most important exploratory committee \never launched by the Federal Government and that is the Lewis and Clark \nExpedition.\n  One way to mark this very special time would be to enact a new Oregon \nwilderness bill, which I could conceive of as the Lewis and Clark Mount \nHood Wilderness Act of 2004. In tribute to the great river-dependent \njourney of Lewis and Clark, I believe it would also be appropriate to \nadd four free-flowing stretches of rivers to the National Wild and \nScenic River System.\n  In the last few years, Congress has protected some of my home State's \nmost important treasures: Steens Mountain is now home to 170,000 acres \nof wilderness. The Little Sandy watershed is now part of the Bull Run \nManagement unit and will help provide drinking water for over 700,000 \nOregonians. Soda Mountain has been designated a national monument. Fort \nClatsop National Memorial has been expanded, and this year it may be \ndesignated as Oregon's second national park.\n  The draft I have been discussing with my constituents would take a \nfresh look at protecting the lower elevation forests surrounding Mount \nHood and the Columbia River Gorge. These forests symbolize the natural \nbeauty of my home State. They provide the clean water for the \nbiological survival of threatened steelhead, Coho, and Chinook salmon. \nThese forests provide critical habitat and diverse ecosystems for elk, \ndeer, and of course the majestic bald eagle. These are the forests that \nprovide unparalleled recreational opportunities for millions of \nOregonians and all of our visitors.\n  Mount Hood is the highest mountain in my home State. Captain Clark \ndescribed it as ``a mountain of immense height, covered with snow,'' \nwhile John Muir described Mount Hood a bit more poetically as ``one \nglorious manifestation of divine power.''\n  ``Wy'East'' is the American Indian name for Mount Hood. Before Lewis \nand Clark came to what we now know as my home State, these forests and \nspecies they supported in turn supported native Indians for thousands \nof years. These are the forests that connect the high elevation \nsnowfields with the rich, diverse lower valleys that produce our famous \nsalmon which were described as so plentiful one could walk across the \nriver on their backs.\n  Although the history of Mount Hood and her environs are fascinating, \nthe need to designate these areas as protected wilderness and wild and \nscenic rivers is best expressed by the very modern stories of increased \npressures from development and recreational use that are at the heart \nof our State's future.\n  The need to protect and build on Oregon's wilderness system that is \nas important now as it was in 1804, 1964, or 1984. There are currently \n189,200 acres of designated wilderness on the Mount Hood National \nForest. I believe it would be appropriate this year, 2004, to discuss a \ndraft bill which would almost double that amount by designating \napproximately 160,000 new acres of wilderness thereby lessening the \npressures of overuse while also staving off the threat of development.\n  Today, the economic role of these important public lands has shifted. \nCommunities on the highway to Mount Hood often market themselves as the \n``Gateway to Mount Hood,'' and see this as a special opportunity to \nimprove their tourism.\n  They should. On weekends, crowds of Oregonians come out of the cities \nseeking a natural and often wild experience. In the 20 years that has \nelapsed since any new wilderness has been designated in the Mount Hood \narea, the population in the local counties has increased \nsignificantly--20 percent in my home county of Multnomah, 24 percent in \nHood River County, and 41 percent in Clackamas County.\n  With increasing emphasis on wild scenery, unspoiled wildlife \nhabitats, free flowing rivers, wilderness, and the need for \nopportunities for diverse outdoor recreation, it seems to me that very \noften we are in jeopardy of loving our wild places to death. A few \nyears ago, the Forest Service made a proposal to limit the number of \npeople who could hike the south side of Mount Hood. I can tell you the \npublic outcry was staggering.\n  So it seems to me, rather than to tell people they are going to be \nrestricted from using our public lands, the solution lies in providing \nmore opportunities for them to enjoy our great places. I have heard \nfrom community after community that they fear a threat to their local \ndrinking water or the need for further protections from development. \nCongressional statutory designation as wilderness provides the only \nreal protection of the historic, scientific, cultural, environmental, \nscenic, and recreational values that contribute to the quality of life \nof which the people of my State are so proud.\n  The protection of the special Oregon places is going to depend on the \nhard work and dedication of all Oregonians, and especially my \ncolleagues in the Congress.\n  I have had a chance already to discuss this with Senator Smith. He \nand I always work in a bipartisan way. As always, he has been very \ngracious with respect to saying he would work with me and will join me \nin listening to the people of Oregon.\n  I have also been pleased today to be able to talk to Congressman \nWalden, who is the new chair of an important subcommittee who will be \nin a position to listen to the people of our State, take their ideas, \nand take their input on this draft. I also have talked to Congressman \nBlumenauer today, who represents the congressional district that I was \nso proud to represent for 15 years in the House of Representatives.\n  I believe the four of us in particular will take the time now to \nlisten to the people of our State, the county commissioners, the \nenvironmentalists, the\n\n[[Page S3170]]\n\nentrepreneurs, the chambers of commerce, the Governor, various State-\nelected officials who have an interest in this issue, and other \ninterested parties and work to try to get this important work done in \nthe right fashion.\n  I have been very proud to have been involved in two natural resource \nefforts in the last few years where people thought the polarization was \nso great that you could not get anything done. With respect to the \ncounty payments legislation Senator Craig and I teamed up on a matter \nthat was absolutely critical to funding schools and roads. We worked in \na bipartisan way, listened to people, and got an important piece of \nlegislation passed.\n  We did the same thing with respect to forest health legislation \nearlier in this Congress. People said we couldn't get a bill out of the \nSenate. A lot of people of good will, including the Presiding Officer \ntonight, came together and we got 80 votes for it in the Senate.\n  When you listen to people, it is possible to get important natural \nresources legislation passed. I think it would be very appropriate to \ntake the draft I am now circulating to the people of Oregon, spend the \nnecessary time listening to people of our State, and turn it into \nlegislation that could be considered formally by the Congress and \nperfect it in the coming weeks and days ahead. Congress ought to try to \npass this legislation after listening to the people of my home State. \nThe grandeur of Mount Hood and other Oregon treasures can be assured \nfor future generations if we can come together and approach this in a \nbipartisan way.\n  That is what I am committed to doing based on my conversations today \nwith Congressman Walden and Congressman Blumenauer, the Members who are \nmost affected by the legislation, and Senator Smith who has joined me \nso often. I am convinced our delegation is committed to doing this job \nright, recognizing that 2004 is a momentous year for wilderness in our \nState.\n  I would very much like to see the people of our State, working with \nour congressional delegation, coming together and passing a Lewis and \nClark Mount Hood Wilderness Act of 2004. We have a lot of work ahead of \nus in the days ahead, but we are committed to approaching this in a \nresponsible and bipartisan fashion. I want to tell the people of my \nState I think it would be exciting to make sure that we could take \nsteps in this session to ensure that, for the millions who will come to \nvisit Mount Hood in the days ahead, we have acted to preserve the \ngrandeur of this spectacular treasure.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in a few minutes we will be closing for the \nevening, but over the next several minutes I would like to comment on a \ncouple of events from today, and then, in closing, we will talk a bit \nabout what to expect over the next several days and next week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/25/senate-section/article/S3170-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3170-S3171]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                CONGRESS BUILDING AMERICA NATIONAL BUILD\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I, first, would like to comment on the way \nmy day began. It happened to begin with the distinguished Presiding \nofficer, the Senator from Minnesota, early this morning, as we engaged \nin a project that many people around the country have participated in. \nFor those who have not, I hope they do participate in it; and that is, \nto build--I was not going to say a house--but, indeed, a home as part \nof Habitat for Humanity.\n  Not too far from here--about 15 minutes from our Nation's Capitol--\nthere is a plot of land. We have been blessed in many ways because, \nright now, we have been part of a group of people who put up several \nhouses. We did not put them all up today, but eventually that whole \nsite--and it is probably a couple-acre site; actually, it must be \nlarger than that--will have 50 different houses with individual \nhomeowners, families who will call those houses their homes.\n  Many of those people have no homes today, but they have devoted a \nfair amount of planning, with their sweat and their equity and their \nspirit, in helping to construct these houses through Habitat for \nHumanity.\n  We were there with a number of House Members and Senate Members. It \nwas bipartisan, bicameral. It was part of what is called ``Congress \nBuilding America.'' Today was called: ``Congress Building America \nNational Build.''\n  It was a great celebration this morning. Millard Fuller was there. \nMillard Fuller is the man who had the vision and the heart to first \nthink of and then lay out and then implement Habitat for Humanity \nInternational. His commitment reflects a merging, a coming together of \nfaith, a call to service. He has professional training. He has been a \nvery successful attorney. We had an opportunity to congratulate him, \nbut also to spend most of the morning working side by side with him.\n  Millard is a fascinating individual. He travels around the world both \npromoting and educating people about Habitat for Humanity. I talked to \nhim a bit this morning about recent trips I have had the opportunity to \nmake, again, one with the Presiding Officer to Africa, where, to me, we \nhave a great opportunity, but also there is great hope, as we look at \nthat continent today.\n  This morning there were teams of five or six people who worked \ntogether, with a leader in that team. I was not the leader for those 3 \nto 4 hours. We had a young woman by the name of Dawn, who is part of \nthe AmeriCorps affiliation with Habitat for Humanity, who walked us \nthrough the construction of this house that was nothing but a slab of \nconcrete, but by the time we left, it had the walls up around it.\n  But part of my team was also Charlissa Tomlinson. Charlissa is the \nowner of the home, who began, about 2 years ago, with this dream, and \nnow, with her three children there today, participated in the \nconstruction of that very house.\n\n  As we put up that last wall, and there was a window there, and we \nlooked out the window, I asked: Whose bedroom is this going to be? She \nvery quickly told me which child's bedroom it was going to be.\n  She has been very active in her church, very active in her community. \nThe realization of her family's dream shows us how powerful volunteers \ncan be, how the very best of the public sector, Government, which \nfunds, in part, Habitat for Humanity, and the 10 or 15 sponsors, \norganizations, companies that invest, and invest heavily, in support of \nHabitat for Humanity can come together.\n  I thank my colleagues because this is the first year we have had \nbroad bipartisan, bicameral participation. A number of Senators have \ngone out and participated before, but today we broke all records in \nterms of Senate participation in this wonderful, wonderful project.\n  We were there to demonstrate our commitment, as elected leaders. I \nshould also add that the spouses of the Senators were there as well \nthroughout the morning. They even stayed into the afternoon. But we \nreally were there to demonstrate our commitment, our deep, personal \ncommitment to affordable home ownership for low-income American \nfamilies.\n  We were also there to show our appreciation for faith-based groups \nand other nonprofits such as Habitat for Humanity that do provide these \ncritical services to individuals and families in need across America.\n  Home ownership is such an essential part of our lives, of our social \ninvestments, of our economic investments. It is empowering to families. \nIt is empowering to communities. It contributes economic vitality to \nareas and regions in communities where these beautiful new homes arise. \nSo it was an exciting project this morning. We have done a lot.\n  As we were there and looking around, we saw the AmeriCorps \nvolunteers. There was a group of college students from Cornell who, \ninstead of going where 99.9 percent of the college students go--to \nvacation, which I guess is Florida or the west coast or to warmer \nweather--dedicated their spring vacation to being there and hammering \nnails, and spending their 8 days away from Cornell--again, colleges all \nover the country are doing this, but they\n\n[[Page S3171]]\n\nwere with us today, and the volunteers from the community, working with \nthe corporate executives, working with the Members of the Senate. It \nwas really, really gratifying.\n  The Congress participates and works with the administration. We \nprovided $27 million this year for the Self-Help Homeownership \nOpportunity Program, SHOP. Under this grant program, homeowners \ncontribute significant amounts of their own volunteer labor to the \nconstruction or to the rehabilitation of a property. President Bush \nrequested $67 million next year for this particular program, SHOP, \nSelf-Help Homeownership Opportunity Program.\n\n  The 108th Congress passed and President Bush signed the American \nDream Downpayment Act of 2003. That is going to help over 40,000 \nfamilies a year with their downpayment and closing costs and further \nstrengthen our housing market all over the country. Seeing the Senate \nin action, as we hammered and nailed and put the siding up, made me \nrealize how much this body does do and cares in terms of eliminating \npoverty housing in America. I hope that demonstrates our commitment to \nthat goal and our continued commitment for affordable housing \nthroughout America but in particular for low-income American families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/25/senate-section/article/S3171-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3171-S3172]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       UNBORN VICTIMS OF VIOLENCE\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the rest of today was spent on a very \nimportant initiative that was really long overdue. That was addressing \nthe issue of the Unborn Victims of Violence Act.\n  I very much appreciate the Democratic leadership working with us to \nhave a unanimous consent agreement today where we could begin this \nmorning and continue straight through in a very orderly way, have very \ngood debate, very good amendments on the floor of the Senate, and then, \n8 hours after we began, to come to a conclusion with a vote that will \nhave a huge impact, an impact on victims of violence that were \nprotected in some States but in many States were not.\n  The issue at hand really boiled down to that single question, that \nwhen a pregnant woman is murdered along with her unborn baby, is there \none victim or are there two? All of this is very simple. It is simple \nto me in terms of understanding it, but also simple in that it applies \nso directly to humanity.\n  There is a case that I never talked about on the floor today. It came \nto mind this afternoon in a press conference later where there were \nfour families that were victims of violence, and they told their \nstories. It was very powerful. I am not sure if it was captured by the \nnews cameras there or not, or if many people will see it--very powerful \nstories.\n  But it did remind me of a story, a recent case in my own State of \nTennessee. It was an early morning in January, and two young men gunned \ndown Tracey Owens on an empty street in south Nashville. Tracey was \nbetween 38 and 40 weeks pregnant, just about ready to deliver, could \nhave delivered any day. The perpetrators said they believed they had \nhit the pregnant woman with their truck and they were afraid they would \nget in trouble. So they stopped and they got out, and as Tracey was \nlaying there crying out for help, one of the assailants just looked at \nher and said: Here is your help. And with that, he shot her in the \nabdomen, actually shot her five times with a .22-caliber pistol. One of \nthose bullets actually hit the baby and she was about ready to deliver.\n\n  After murdering Tracey and her unborn baby, the two men went back to \nan ex-girlfriend's apartment. They cleaned the weapon off, and then \nthey fell asleep. They were picked up after a motorist found Tracey's \nbody and a witness at the scene told investigators they had seen the \ntwo men shooting at parked cars. Investigators quickly found the \nculprits, and they quickly confessed. The perpetrators now sit in jail \nawaiting the grand jury.\n  A police detective in the case said: In my 22 years on the job, I \nhave never seen anyone executed--and I mean executed--because someone \nthought they had hit the person with a vehicle.\n  Tennessee is one of 29 States with a fetal homicide law on the books. \nSo then the question arises, was Tracey's baby, who was only days away \nfrom delivery, also slain? That is what this bill was about today. That \nis what this act was about. That is why it is so important that this \nbody responded and responded so positively with the final vote, now \njust an hour or an hour and a half ago. The answer to that question to \nme is simple. I think it is simple. Ultimately, no matter how you voted \ntoday, the answer is straightforward.\n  The reason why I use this example is because it is so obvious. You \nonly have to look at the autopsy results themselves. The medical \nexaminer did not examine just Tracey alone; she examined the baby as \nwell. Indeed, that is how we know that the baby was shot by one of \nthose five shots. That little baby was hit. And common sense tells us \nthat in examining the murder victims, the coroner was faced not just \nwith one dead body but with two dead bodies.\n  We have groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union which \nopposed the bill, the Unborn Victims of Violence Act. They said that \ncounting two victims is a ``dangerous attempt to separate a woman from \nher fetus in the eyes of the law.'' In other words, they tried to cast \nthis as an abortion issue.\n  One of the wonderful things about the discussion today is that \neverytime someone tried to cast it as an abortion issue, that was \ndebunked and was made very clear that this is not an abortion issue.\n  When a husband intentionally punches his expectant wife in the \nabdomen with the express purpose of causing a miscarriage, it is he who \nis separating the woman from the fetus.\n  I would argue that when a boyfriend tires of his pregnant girlfriend \nand hires an assassin to dispose of the girlfriend and the baby, he is \nkilling two human beings. One may even argue that the baby is in fact--\nand many times is--the primary target.\n  But we don't need to examine the motives of the perpetrators in these \nreal life cases to reach those conclusions. Even if an assailant is \nunaware of his victim's pregnancy, should he, the perpetrator, decide \nwhether or not the baby exists? Should we accept that because he didn't \nknow when he was killing one person he was snuffing out the life of a \nsecond, there is no second crime?\n  The Unborn Victims of Violence Act does. And now we know it is going \nto go to the President. This was the exact same act that passed in the \nHouse of Representatives and, thus, we know there is no stopping this \none. It is going to go to the President. This act protects the rights \nof the baby to come into this world as the mother intends, and it holds \nthe criminal responsible for endangering the life and the health of the \nchild.\n  We did have an amendment today from the senior Senator from \nCalifornia that was offered that said it was sufficient to add special \npenalties for attacking a woman who is pregnant. Indeed, it really \npushed aside the intent of the underlying bill and said it is \nsufficient to add special penalties for attacking a woman who is \npregnant. And tougher laws will assuage the feelings of the devastated \nfamily and compensate the mother for her sense of loss. All of that \nmisses the point, the heart and soul of this underlying legislation. \nThe harmed child is not notional. The harmed child is not a sense. The \nharmed child is not an emotion. The baby is real and the loss is real.\n\n  Again, I wish my colleagues could have heard today the four families \nwho suffered such real and tragic losses. The second life has been \nharmed, whether intentional or not. Verbal evasions and euphemisms \nsimply cannot hide this plain fact. I think about an expectant mother, \nher excitement about her family, her future family, how she starts to \nshow, and even strangers, when she walks by, begin to smile and ask, \n``When is the baby due?'' You cannot help but think of friends who are \nthrowing showers or the metro rider who stands up and offers his seat \nfor that expectant mother.\n  Our natural reaction is to celebrate the miracle of life and offer \nour love and compassion, not for a theory, or a theoretical baby, but \nfor an actual baby--a baby we hope will be born and will be healthy.\n  Well, this act, the Unborn Victims of Violence Act, which now is \ngoing to be the law of the land, recognizes the simple reality. It is \nnot about abortion, as its opponents took great pains to argue but \nwhich was debunked today. It doesn't undermine the 1973 Roe v. Wade \nSupreme Court decision, as even pro-\n\n[[Page S3172]]\n\nchoice legal scholars admit. The Unborn Victims of Violence Act is \nabout simple humanity, simple reality.\n  A child in the womb, whether you call it a baby or a fetus, is alive, \nit is real, and it deserves our best efforts to protect it from \ncriminal harm, and with the action of this body today, and with the \naction of the House of Representatives in the past, this act will \nbecome the law of the land, soon to be signed by the President of the \nUnited States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/25/senate-section/article/S3172-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3172]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             ORGAN DONATION\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

I would like to close on that \nthird topic.\n  The bill is called the Organ Donation and Recovery Improvement Act. \nFor the 10, 12, to 15 years before I came to the Senate, that is what I \nhad the privilege of doing, transplanting hearts and lungs together, \nfor end stage disease, for people who would otherwise die but had the \nopportunity and blessing to be able to have taken out those diseased \norgans--out of somebody who otherwise would die usually within 3 to 6 \nmonths, and replace those with organs that would allow them to live 10, \n15, 20, or 40 years.\n  It is marvelous what American medicine and science can do generally, \nbut also that the good Lord allows that miraculous procedure to happen \ntoday. It was only imagined not too long ago.\n  This particular bill, which we will be passing shortly, represents \nthe most significant reforms to organ donation in over a decade. It \nimproves research, improves public awareness, and helps us improve the \nprocess, which makes organ transplantation possible. It is not hard to \ntake the diseased organs out. The real challenge we have is finding the \navailable, appropriate organs to transplant, actually implant into that \nchest. That is the shortage. People are dying every day, waiting for a \nheart, waiting for a lung, waiting for kidneys, a liver, or a pancreas, \nand the problem is the shortage of donors. But in truth, there are \nplenty of donors out there. It is how you get this potential supply to \nmeet this huge demand. Right now, the supply is too small. When the \ndemand is high, all these people are dying. If we increase the supply, \nthese people begin to live. It is as simple as that. This legislation \nmoves us in that direction.\n  I want to applaud the work of Senator Chris Dodd, our colleague from \nConnecticut, who helped lead the fight to pass this legislation in the \nSenate, and also our colleague from New Hampshire, Judd Gregg, chairman \nof the Health, Education, Labor, Pensions Committee, for his support. \nThis particular bill that will pass tonight was passed by the House of \nRepresentatives yesterday. I recognize the leadership of Representative \nBilirakis and Billy Tauzin, who have been instrumental in leading this \ninitiative in the House.\n  Organ donation is one of the most challenging issues we face today \nbecause of this supply-demand issue. The real supply is bigger than the \nrealized supply, and that is what this bill sets out to achieve. About \n82,000 to 84,000 people are waiting today for an organ to become \navailable. Many will become available tonight--hopefully, a lot--\ntomorrow, and every day. But it is not enough. You have people dying.\n  I will be speaking principally, using figures on America, the U.S. \nWhile organ donations increased by 7.5 percent since 2002, it is a \nsmall increase. The 84,000 people waiting have far outstripped that in \nterms of the number of people added to the waiting list. By improving \npublic awareness to encourage organ donation, we literally save lives, \nhundreds and thousands of lives.\n  This legislation takes a comprehensive approach. It will not solve \nthe problem, but it is a comprehensive approach to increase organ \ndonation and, at the same time, improving the overall efficiency of the \norgan donation process. I believe patients and families will soon \nbenefit from this very important legislation tonight.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/25/senate-section/article/S3172-2", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3172]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    AMENDING THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT TO PROMOTE ORGAN DONATION\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  On October 21, 2000, in Fort Worth, TX, a 17-year old high school \nstudent was hospitalized after two peers allegedly attacked him in a \nparking lot. The young assailants beat the victim and scratched anti-\ngay slurs into his car. The victim suffered a broken nose and numerous \nother injuries, including blood clots on his brain.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/25/senate-section/article/S3172-4", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3172-S3173]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                    SPECIALIST CHRISTOPHER E. HUDSON\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart and deep \nsense of gratitude to honor the life of a brave young man from Carmel, \nIN. Specialist Christopher Hudson, 21 years old, died in Abu Ghraib, \njust west of Baghdad, on March 21, 2004, during an attack when the \nHumvee he was riding in was struck by an improvised explosive device.\n  After joining the Army in November of 2002, Chris was assigned to the \n2nd Battalion, 12th Cavalry Regiment, 1st Cavalry Division based in \nFort Hood, TX. Chris served as a gunner during his deployment, which \nbegan when his unit joined the efforts in Iraq one year ago. With his \nentire life before him, Chris chose to risk everything to fight for the \nvalues Americans hold close to our hearts, In a land halfway around the \nworld.\n  Chris was the twenty-fifth Hoosier soldier to be killed while serving \nhis country in Operation Iraqi Freedom. This brave young soldier leaves \nbehind his father; his mother, Sally; his wife, Michelle; his 1-year-\nold son, Gavon; and 3-year-old daughter, Veronika. May Chris' children \ngrow up knowing that their father gave his life so that young Iraqis \nwill some day know the freedom they enjoy.\n  Today, I join Chris' family, his friends, and the entire Carmel \ncommunity in mourning his death. While we struggle to bear our sorrow \nover his death, we can also take pride in the example he set, bravely \nfighting to make the world a safer place. It is his courage and \nstrength of character that people will remember when they think of \nChris, a memory that will burn brightly during these continuing days of \nconflict and grief.\n  When looking back on the life of her late husband, Chris' wife \nMichelle told the Indianapolis Star that he ``was proud to defend his \ncountry . . . His family loves him, misses him and is very proud of \nhim.'' Today and always, Chris will be remembered by family members, \nfriends and fellow Hoosiers as a true American hero, and we honor the \nsacrifice he made while serving his country.\n  As I search for words to do justice in honoring Chris' sacrifice, I \nam reminded of President Lincoln's remarks\n\n[[Page S3173]]\n\nas he addressed the families of the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: ``We \ncannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. \nThe brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated \nit, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little \nnote nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what \nthey did here.'' This statement is just as true today as it was nearly \n150 years ago, as I am certain that the impact of Chris' actions will \nlive on far longer than any record of these words.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Christopher E. Hudson in the \nOfficial Record of the United States Senate for his service to this \ncountry and for his profound commitment to freedom, democracy and \npeace. When I think about this just cause in which we are engaged, and \nthe unfortunate pain that comes with the loss of our heroes, I hope \nthat families like Chris' can find comfort in the words of the prophet \nIsaiah who said, ``He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord \nGod will wipe away tears from off all faces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may Gold \nbless America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/25/senate-section/article/S3173-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3173]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   OPPOSITION UNDER ATTACK IN BELARUS\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, in recent days the Belarusian Prosecutor \nGeneral's office opened criminal proceedings against one of the leaders \nof the embattled Belarusian democratic opposition, Anatoly Lebedka. \nAnatoly, who is chairman of the United Civic Party, has been accused of \ndefaming Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko during an interview \nwith Russian television last month where he linked the recent \nBelarusian-Russian dispute over gas deliveries with the Belarusian \nauthorities' failure to build an efficient economy. Anatoly also \nmentioned a shadow budget replenished through illegal arms sales and \nthe cover-up of the truth about political disappearances in Belarus.\n  Given the pattern of behavior of the Lukashenko regime, it is crystal \nclear that this case is politically motivated and designed to suppress \ndissent. Lebedka's United Civic Party is a member of the Popular \nCoalition Five Plus, an opposition bloc which is planning to field \ncandidates in this fall's parliamentary elections.\n  The action against Anatoly Lebedka and on the opposition fits \nsquarely within a pattern of the suppression of independent thought and \naction in Belarus. Lukashenko's repression of those who would dare to \nchallenge him has only intensified over the past year. Just last week, \na criminal case was opened against the Belarusian Helsinki Committee \nchairperson Tatiana Protska and accountant Tatiana Rudkevich. This \ncomes after politically-motivated economic sanctions were imposed on \nthe Committee recently. Also within the last few days, a court seized \nproperty of Iryna Makavetskaya, a correspondent for one of Belarus' \nleading independent newspapers, Beloruskaya Delovaya Gazeta.\n  Lukashenko has a choice--he can continue to act as a pariah, \nsuppressing the voices of democracy in Belarus, or he can realize that \nthe only way to reverse his self-imposed isolation from the \ninternational community and increasingly, from his own people is to end \nhis offensive against democracy and civil society.\n  Meanwhile, it is essential that the United States back up its \nrhetorical support for democratic forces in Belarus through concrete \nassistance. Earlier this Congress, I introduced the Belarus Democracy \nAct, a measure with bipartisan support designed to promote democracy, \nhuman rights and the rule of law in Belarus. In light of the campaign \nof repression against democratic forces in Belarus, timely \nconsideration of the Belarus Democracy Act is warranted. I urge \ncolleagues to support this important legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/25/senate-section/article/S3173-2", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3173]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CLOSING THE GUN SHOW LOOPHOLE\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, three weeks ago the Senate passed an \namendment during consideration of the gun immunity bill which would \nclose the gun show loophole. I supported this amendment because I \nbelieve it is common sense gun safety legislation.\n  Under current law, when an individual buys a handgun from a licensed \ndealer, there are federal requirements for a background check to insure \nthat the purchaser is not a person prohibited from purchasing or \npossessing a firearm. However, this is not the case for all gun \npurchases. For example, when an individual wants to buy a handgun from \nanother private citizen who is not a licensed gun dealer, there is no \nrequirement to ensure that the purchaser is not in a prohibited \ncategory. This creates a loophole in the law, which makes it easy for \ncriminals, terrorists, and other prohibited buyers to evade background \nchecks and buy guns. This loophole is the gateway to the illegal market \nbecause criminals know they are not subject to a background check and \nno record is made of the sale.\n  I cosponsored the amendment offered by Senators Jack Reed and John \nMcCain, which would close the gun show loophole, because I believe it \nis a critical tool in preventing guns from getting into the hands of \ncriminals and other ineligible buyers. This amendment would have simply \napplied existing law governing background checks to individuals buying \nfirearms at gun shows. Preventing easy and unchecked access to guns is \ncritical in preventing gun violence.\n  This amendment also had the support of major law enforcement \norganizations including the International Association of Chiefs of \nPolice, the National Troopers Coalition, the International Brotherhood \nof Police Officers, the Police Executive Research Forum, the Major \nCities Chiefs, the National Association of School Resource Officers, \nthe National Black Police Association, the National Organization of \nBlack Law Enforcement Executives, and the Hispanic American Police \nCommand Officers Association.\n  The gun industry immunity legislation would have provided \nunprecedented protection from liability to gun manufacturers and \ndealers, even in cases where their own gross negligence or recklessness \nled to someone being injured or killed. I opposed the bill and it was \ndefeated in the Senate. However, before the bill was defeated, the gun \nshow loophole amendment passed with bipartisan support. Given that, I \nhope the Senate will take up and pass gun show loophole legislation \nthis year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/25/senate-section/article/S3173-3", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3173-S3174]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               CBO REPORT\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Pete V. Domenici,\n     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has \n     prepared the enclosed cost estimate for S. 1107, the \n     Recreational Fee Authority Act of 2004.\n       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be \n     pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is Deborah \n     Reis, who can be reached at 226-2860.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Douglas Holtz-Eakin,\n                                                         Director.\n       Enclosure.\n\n            S. 1107--Recreational Fee Authority Act of 2004\n\n       Summary: S. 1107 would authorize the National Park Service \n     (NPS) to establish, charge, and modify admission and user \n     fees at units of the National Park System. Section 3 of the \n     bill would allow the NPS to retain and spend all offsetting \n     receipts collected under this authority without further \n     appropriation. Both the authority to collect and to spend NPS \n     recreation receipts would become effective on January 1, \n     2006, the day after the existing recreation fee demonstration \n     program expires. (Created in 1996, the demonstration program \n     authorizes the NPS and other federal land management agencies \n     to charge higher recreation fees than would otherwise be \n     permitted and to spend the proceeds.)\n       The effect of S. 1107 on total recreation fee receipts and \n     spending would partly depend on how the NPS would use the \n     bill's authorities in conjunction with current law following \n     the expiration of the current demonstration program. For this \n     estimate, CBO assumes that the NPS would use the authorities \n     provided under S. 1107 to continue the\n\n[[Page S3174]]\n\n     recreation fee demonstration program permanently. We estimate \n     that direct spending would increase under the bill by $592 \n     million over the 2006-2014 period because the bill would \n     authorize the spending of fee collections that would not \n     otherwise be available.\n       This legislation contains no intergovernmental or private-\n     sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform \n     Act (UMRA) and would impose no costs on state, local, or \n     tribal governments.\n       Estimated cost to the Federal Government: The estimated net \n     budgetary impact of S. 1107 is summarized in the table below. \n     The costs of this legislation fall within budget function 300 \n     (natural resources and environment).\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                         By fiscal year, in millions of dollars--\n                                ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                    2004       2005       2006       2007       2008       2009       2010       2011       2012       2013       2014\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                     DIRECT SPENDING\n \nNPS Recreation Fee Program Net\n Spending Under Current Law:\n    Budget Authority \\1\\.......          0          0        -63        -79        -81        -82        -84        -86        -88        -89        -91\n    Estimated Outlays..........          6         30         76          5        -59        -79        -84        -86        -88        -89        -91\nProposed Changes:\n    Authorization Level........          0          0         63         79         81         82         84         86         88         89         91\n    Estimated Outlays..........          0          0         -4         33         62         77         82         83         85         86         88\nNPS Recreation Fee Program Net\n Spending Under S. 1107:\n    Authorization Level........          0          0          0          0          0          0          0          0          0          0          0\n    Estimated Outlays..........          6         30         72         38          3          0         -2         -3         -3         -3         -3\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ The current law amounts represent net direct spending of the NPS under the existing recreation fee demonstration program (which expires on December\n  31, 2005) and under the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act (LWCFA), which will govern the collection and spending of NPS recreation fees after\n  December 31, 2005.\n\n       Basis of Estimate: For this estimate, CBO assumes that the \n     NPS would collect and spend recreation fees at all park units \n     under the authority provided by S. 1107, at rates similar to \n     those it now charges under the recreation demonstration \n     program. S. 1107 would provide broad, permanent authority to \n     collect and spend recreation fees at NPS sites similar to \n     that contained in the temporary recreation fee demonstration \n     program. Unlike that program, however, the bill would not \n     specifically repeal or override the fee-related provisions in \n     the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act (LWCFA). The LWCFA \n     will govern the collection and spending of recreation fees \n     after December 31, 2005. Moreover, the bill would not apply \n     to other federal land management agencies that offer similar, \n     often competing, recreation opportunities. This estimate is \n     based on information provided by NPS and assumes that the NPS \n     determines that the fee caps, fee prohibitions, and other fee \n     limitations contained in the LWCFA would not apply to fees \n     that would be established under S. 1107.\n       CBO estimates that enacting S. 1107 would essentially \n     continue the current recreation demonstration program. The \n     bill--like the demonstration program--would allow the NPS to \n     spend 100 percent of all receipts. Starting in 2006, the \n     LWCFA would otherwise authorize the spending of 15 percent of \n     recreation receipts.\n       The net effect of these changes would be an increase in \n     direct spending authority of $63 million for fiscal year \n     2006, $79 million in 2007 (the first full year after the new \n     authority would become effective), and $745 million through \n     fiscal year 2014. CBO estimates that outlays from this new \n     spending authority would total $592 million over the 2006-\n     2014 period.\n       Under the bill, recreation fees could also increase by as \n     much as $32 million in 2006 and between $41 million and $47 \n     million a year thereafter, but any new receipts would be \n     offset by an identical increase in new spending. If the NPS \n     were to determine that it must abide by specific restrictions \n     in the LWCFA when establishing fees under S. 1107, the agency \n     would probably not implement any significant increase in \n     offsetting receipts. In the event that no new receipts could \n     be collected under S. 1107, the NPS would be authorized to \n     spend recreation fees under the bill, and the net budget \n     impact would be similar.\n       In addition, because fees charged by other land-management \n     agencies would not be increased under S. 1107, it is possible \n     that the NPS might not be able to charge higher fees at some \n     parks without putting itself at a competitive disadvantage \n     with other federal recreation providers. In that event, the \n     NPS may not be able to increase rates to the level estimated \n     here; however, the net budget impact would be the same \n     because spending would fall by the same amount.\n       Intergovernmental and private-sector impact: S. 1107 \n     contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as \n     defined in UMRA and would impose no costs on state, local, or \n     tribal governments.\n       Estimate prepared by: Federal Costs: Deborah Reis (226-\n     2860); Impact on State, Local, and Tribal Governments: \n     Marjorie Miller (225-3220); and Impact on the Private Sector: \n     Selena Caldera (226-2966).\n       Estimate approved by: Peter H.

Mr. President, I rise today to begin the process of \nplacing directly on the Senate calendar stand-alone electric \nreliability legislation.\n  As all my colleagues in this body are well aware, devising a \ncomprehensive policy that will help this nation achieve its energy \nindependence is a task that has divided the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee on which I serve, the United States Senate and the \nCongress as a whole for three years now. Regardless, I believe that \nthere is at least one thing on which every Senator can agree--and that \nis the need to pass legislation giving the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission, working closely with regional entities, the statutory \nauthority to put in place mandatory and enforceable reliability \nstandards.\n  The call for legislation of the kind we are introducing today dates \nback to at least 1997, when both a Task Force established by the \nClinton Administration's Department of Energy and a North American \nElectric Reliability Council, or NERC, blue ribbon panel independently \ndetermined that reliability rules for our nation's electric system \nneeded to be mandatory and enforceable.\n  In response, the Senate passed stand-alone legislation on this \nmatter, authored by my predecessor Senator Gorton, in June 2000. Since \nthen, under the leadership of both parties, the Senate has twice passed \nconsensus-based electric reliability provisions--most recently, last \nJuly.\n  There is no doubt that this nation's consumers and businesses cannot \nafford further delay in improving the reliability of the electricity \ngrid. Last August's Northeast/Midwest blackout, which affected 50 \nmillion consumers from New York to Michigan, again sounded the wake up \ncall for federal electric reliability legislation.\n  I would like to quote from a January 1, 2004 letter published in the \nNew York Times from North American Electric Reliability Council \nPresident and CEO Michehl R. Gent. Mr. Gent wrote that interim steps \nNERC has taken to improve grid reliability since last August's blackout \ndoes ``not reduce the need for federal legislation that would provide \nauthority to impose and enforce mandatory reliability standards. \nWhether legislation is adopted on a stand-alone basis or as part of a \ncomprehensive energy bill, passage is essential. If reliability \nlegislation had been enacted when first proposed [in 1999], I believe \nthat the blackout would not have occurred.''\n  Mr. Gent reiterated this position in February 24, 2004 testimony \nbefore the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. I asked Mr. \nGent whether in fact it wouldn't be irresponsible of this body not to \npass reliability legislation this year, even if we are to pass it on a \nstand-alone basis. Quite simply, Mr. Gent replied, ``I agree.''\n  We are beginning the process of putting this legislation directly on \nthe Senate calendar because we believe American consumers have waited \nlong enough for Congress to take this simple step, putting in place \nmandatory and enforceable reliability standards to govern operation of \nthe electric transmission grid--the backbone of our nation's economy.\n  There are those who will argue that we are ill-advised to take this \nstep. They ill argue in favor of taking up and passing last year's \nfailed energy bill conference report (H.R. 6), or S. 2095--the so-\ncalled ``slimmed down'' energy bill introduced this year, which happens \nto be 100 pages longer than the original. However, I am of the firm \nbelief that we cannot allow these crucial reliability provisions to be \nheld hostage to a flawed comprehensive energy bill.\n  Now, I know that the distinguished Chairman of the Senate Energy and\n\n[[Page S3175]]\n\nNatural Resources Committee has worked to strip one of the most \noutrageous provisions of the H.R. 6 conference report--the MTBE \nliability protection, which many Senators simply cannot abide--from the \nnew version of his energy bill. But I am one of the many who believe \nthat the bill that remains requires very, very substantial revision and \nthorough debate. With its origins in last year's conference report, \nthere are far too many provisions in the new bill that the Senate \nEnergy Committee has simply never considered. Moreover, if one of our \nprimary policy goals is to improve the reliability of our nation's \nelectricity grid, I am hard-pressed to see how many of the provisions \nin that bill are relevant.\n  How will weakening the Safe Drinking Water Act help keep the lights \non?\n  Will providing MTBE producers with $2 billion in taxpayer-funded \n``transition'' assistance in any way reduce the likelihood of outages?\n  How would delaying Clean Air Act implementation in our nation's most \npolluted cities ensure reliable operation of our electricity grid?\n  Can anyone really argue that exempting oil companies form Clean Water \nAct requirements will make our high-voltage transmission lines more \nreliable?\n  S. 2095 might not subsidize Hooters, but there remain plenty of \nhandouts to the polluters and corporate looters--none of which have \nanything to do with bolstering the reliability of our transmission \ninfrastructure. And that's before a non-existent conference with the \nHouse, the Leadership of which has publicly expressed its complete \ndisinterest in revisiting the provisions of H.R. 6 most objectionable \nto the Senate. In fact, I ask my colleagues to consider the following \npassage, published in the February 14, 2004 edition of CQ Today.\n  ``You can't start carving out pieces of a deal you already made,'' \nsaid Frank Maisano, a lobbyist who represents several MTBE producers. \n`What the Senate does at this point is irrelevant. This is just a \nvehicle to get to conference.' '' MTBE lobbyists--and perhaps our \ncolleagues on the other side of the Capitol--believe that whatever the \nSenate does within the context of a debate on the new energy bill is \n``irrelevant.'' As the saying goes, ``fool us once, shame on you. Fool \nus twice, shame on us.''\n\n  So Mr. President, in view of the existing gridlock on comprehensive \nenergy legislation, I believe the only responsible course is for this \nbody to bring up and pass stand-alone electric reliability legislation. \nI reject the notion that passing comprehensive energy legislation--such \nas it is--is the sole path to improving the reliability of our nation's \nelectricity grid. We can pass stand-alone reliability legislation. \nWe've done it before. We can--and must--do it again. Good energy policy \nmust not be held hostage to the bad, and I am pleased to begin the \nprocess of placing the bill directly on the Senate calendar.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/25/senate-section/article/S3175-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3175]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RULING AGAINST MICROSOFT\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN.

Mr. President, March 25 has very special meaning in \nGreek history. On this date 183 years ago, a small but resolute band of \nGreek patriots began the struggle to end the foreign domination that \nfor nearly four centuries had oppressed and impoverished Greek lands. \nFor 8 difficult years, resolute and courageous Greek patriots fought \nagainst tremendous odds to secure the liberty of their homeland. On \nthis same date 30 years ago the military junta, which had seized power \nin 1967 and for 7 long years suppressed democratic institutions and \ncivil rights, was brought down, and democracy was restored to the land \nof its invention. These two events, distant in time and nature as they \nare from one another, both mark milestones on the road to the vigorous \nand prosperous democracy that is Greece today.\n  Nearly 200 years ago, the United States and Greece were two young \nrepublics for whom the future was still uncertain. Inspired by \ndemocratic ideas in a world that was largely uncomprehending and \nhostile, both took on the formidable challenge of building viable \ndemocratic institutions. That shared commitment has endured. The United \nStates and Greece have stood together in every major struggle for \nfreedom and democracy: through two devastating World Wars, and through \nthe long decades of the Cold War.\n  The Hellenic Republic was established in 1974. Since that time, \nGreece has built itself into a strong democracy, a vibrant economy, a \nregional leader and an ever more solid partner of the United States. \nGreece has reclaimed its leading role in the region, joining the \nEuropean Community in 1981. In April 2003, the European Union, under \nthe Greek presidency, signed the Accession Treaty to accept 10 new \nmembers in the ancient agora marketplace of Athens, that city serving \nonce again as a cradle for democratic expansion.\n  Greece's democracy has flourished and prospered over the past 30 \nyears. Recent elections have again demonstrated the stability and \nopenness of the nation's political institutions. With the transfer of \npower from one party to another, a new generation of Greek leaders is \nemerging, a generation that promises to build on the strength of the \nexisting relationship with the United States to develop new avenues of \ncooperation.\n  Today Greece is preparing for the 2004 Olympics. It is a matter of \nprofound satisfaction for those of us of Greek ancestry that the Games \nthis year are returning to their birthplace, and that Greece will play \nhost to more than two million athletes and visitors from every corner \nof the world. In connection with the Olympic Games, Greece has \nundertaken structural improvements that are transforming Athens into a \nthoroughly cosmopolitan and modern city, and building facilities and \ninfrastructure throughout the country. The investment Greece has made \nin connection with the Olympics holds out the prospect of a new era, \nfor the people of Greece and visitors to Greece alike. The Games offer \na splendid opportunity to present Greek achievements to the \ninternational community not only in sports but also in cultural, \neconomic and political terms.\n  The founders of the American republic were ardent students of the \nclassics, and they looked to the wisdom and experience of ancient \nGreece as they shaped our nascent political order. In turn, Greek \npatriots struggling to win independence in 1821 turned to the \nprinciples of the new American democracy as they sought to build their \nown new order. In today's turbulent world, the strong and enduring ties \nbetween the two countries are momentous achievements. They give us \ncause for reflection and celebration on this independence day.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 183rd \nanniversary of Greek Independence and pay tribute to the contributions \nof Greece and our Greek-American community. It was on this day in 1821, \nthat Greek patriots rose up against the Ottoman empire and began an 8-\nyear struggle that culminated in a new Greek Republic.\n  It is fitting that we take this day to reflect on the enormous \ncontributions\n\n[[Page S3176]]\n\nthe Greek people have made to the modern world. Our own democratic \nprinciples have their very foundation in the practices of the ancient \nGreek republic. Indeed, the ancient Greeks developed the concept of \ndemocracy, in which the supreme power to govern was vested in the \npeople. Our own Founding Fathers modeled the American government on the \nprinciples of Greek democracy. Thomas Jefferson studied the Greek \nclassics in his youth and was inspired by their philosophy throughout \nhis life, most dramatically when he crafted the Declaration of \nIndependence. When formulating his vision for this country, Jefferson \nspecifically referred to the integrated assertions, theories, and aims \nof the classic Greek world.\n  Today, our admiration for Greece continues. Greece and the United \nStates, partners in NATO, are at the forefront of the effort for \nfreedom, democracy, peace, stability, and human rights, forging a close \nbond between the two nations. We look forward to working closely with \nGreece in the coming years as we examine ways to bring full peace, \nstability, and prosperity to all the nations of Europe and the world.\n  As we celebrate Greek independence, we must also remember the history \nof those who sacrificed their lives to preserve American freedom and \ndemocracy. Greek Americans have served proudly and honorably in every \nU.S. engagement and war. It is through their efforts and others that we \nmaintain a Nation committed to fighting and winning this war or \nterrorism.\n  Today, we join the world in anticipating the momentous 2004 Summer \nOlympic Games, which will be held in Athens, the birthplace of the \nOlympic tradition. This event not only highlights the achievements of \nthousands of world athletes, but signifies the importance of working \ntogether to provide greater opportunity and freedom for the citizens of \nthe world.\n  I am proud to join many of my colleagues as a cosponsor of S. Res. \n308 designating March 25, 2004 as Greek Independence Day: A National \nDay of Celebration of Greek and American Democracy. We value our \nfriendship and continuing partnership with the government and people of \nGreece. I would especially like to offer all Greek Americans my best \nwishes as they celebrate this day of independence. Finally, I ask all \ncitizens to reflect on the many important contributions to freedom, \ndemocracy, peace, and stability Greece and Greek Americans have made to \nthis country and our world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/25/senate-section/article/S3176-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3176]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE OCEANS AND HUMAN HEALTH ACT\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I thank Senators McCain and Hollings and \nthe members of the Commerce Committee for their leadership in moving \nthe Oceans and Human Health Act, S. 1218. I also express my \nappreciation for their willingness to include Senator Levin's request \nand my request to ensure that this bill addresses the needs of the \nGreat Lakes.\n  The Great Lakes are the largest freshwater bodies on earth, holding \napproximately 20 percent of the world's freshwater. While we all know \nthat water is essential for our survival, scientists are only just \nbeginning to appreciate the connection between human health and our \nwaters. It takes approximately 198 years for the lakes to flush \nthemselves. So a pollutant dropped into Lake Superior in Duluth-\nSuperior Harbor in 1805--during the time of the Lewis and Clark \nexpedition, Thomas Jefferson's presidency, and the organization of the \nMichigan Territory--would just now be exiting the water system this \nyear. That means that these large bodies of water are holding much of \nwhat we have put into them following the Industrial Revolution.\n  Industrial development in the Great Lakes region resulted in \nbacterial contamination and floating debris, as well as the release of \npersistent organic pollutants, such as PCBs. By the 1950s, Lake Erie \nshowed signs that there was a great imbalance in the Lake with massive \nalgal blooms and depleted oxygen. These problems resulted in \ncontaminated drinking water and polluted beaches, which contributed to \nepidemics of waterborne diseases, such as typhoid fever. More serious \nhealth problems were discovered years later when scientists began to \nunderstand that some of the nonbiodegradable chemicals would bio-\naccumulate in wildlife and in humans.\n  During the 1970s, Lake Erie was declared dead. It was at that time \nthat significant legislative measures were put in place to control the \npollution entering the Lakes, and for the last several years, the \nregion has benefited from the great improvements to the quality of our \nwater.\n  Until recently, many of us thought that the Great Lakes were well on \ntheir way to becoming drinkable, fishable, and swimable--goals of the \nUnited States/Canadian Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement. However, \ntoday, we face new challenges. We now understand that our environmental \nproblems are more than single-issue, cause and effect problems. \nScientists must consider the entire ecosystem.\n  Over this past year, there are reports of unexplained botulism \noutbreaks on the Lakes, a rise in beach closures and swimming bans, and \na new ``dead zone'' in Lake Erie. Additionally, the Lakes are being \nthreatened by extremely challenging invasive species. People from the \nGreat Lakes region are quite familiar with the more infamous invaders \nlike the zebra mussel, sea lamprey, and Eurasian milfoil, but there are \nnow over 160 nonindigenous aquatic species in the Great lakes with many \nothers on their way. Invasive species are drastically changing the \necosystem and imperiling the health of the Great Lakes and the \nwildlife.\n  Though changes to the Great Lakes are not seen immediately, we know \nwe can impact the Lakes, for better or for worse, through our \nmanagement policies. As the Director of the Great Lakes Environmental \nResearch Lab said, ``The one thing that we can predict with near \ncertainty is that the Great Lakes ecosystem will continue to change and \nthe challenges for effective use and management will only increase.''\n  Because of the many challenges threatening the health of the Great \nLakes and the health of the people who use the Lakes for their drinking \nwater, fishing, or swimming, it is important to understand the link \nbetween our waters and human health. That is why we introduced the \nOceans and Human Health Act. It would authorize the establishment of a \ncoordinated Federal research program to aid in understanding and \nresponding to the role of oceans in human health. The bill would \nestablish a Federal interagency Oceans and Human Health initiative and \ncreate an Oceans and Human Health program at the Department of Commerce \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA. The bill also \nwould direct the Secretary of Commerce to establish a coordinated \npublic information and outreach program to provide information on \npotential ocean-related human health risks.\n  So, again, I thank Senator Hollings and Senator McCain for their \nefforts on this legislation and for accommodating my request and the \nrequest of my colleague, Senator Levin, to ensure that this legislation \nincludes the Great Lakes. It is a good bill and will help us improve \nthe quality of the Lakes and protect them for future generations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/25/senate-section/article/S3176-2", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3176-S3177]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       IN HONOR OF DR.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor Dr. Dorothy Irene \nHeight, a great leader in the struggle for equality, social justice, \nand human rights for all people, and a true American hero.\n  A recognized leader in the cause of civil and human rights, Dr. \nHeight has shown her strength and vision through her efforts to promote \nschool desegregation, educate others regarding the status of women in \nour society, and close our Nation's racial divide.\n  As a tireless advocate for women's rights, Dr. Height was a valued \nfriend of First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt. She later encouraged President \nEisenhower to desegregate the Nation's schools and promoted the \nappointment of African-American women to sub-Cabinet posts under \nPresident Johnson.\n  Dr. Height served as the tenth national president of Delta Sigma \nTheta Sorority, Inc. from 1947 to 1956 and was responsible for \nadvancing the organization's political and social activism, both \nnationally and internationally.\n  Subsequently, as president of the National Council of Negro Women, \nNCNW,\n\n[[Page S3177]]\n\nDr. Height worked ceaselessly to bring attention to the struggle of \nAfrican-American women. Some of these innovative programs include: \nOperation Woman Power, a project to expand business ownership by women; \nthe Women's Center for Education and Career Advancement, a facility \nestablished to empower minority women in nontraditional careers; and \nthe Bethune Museum and Archives, a museum devoted to the history of \nAfrican-American women.\n  Among her other roles, Dr. Height was the only female member of the \n``Big Six'' civil rights leaders, alongside James Farmer, Roy Wilkins, \nWhitney Young, A. Philip Randolph, and Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. \nShe was a mainstay at countless civil and human rights events in the \n1960s and organized ``Wednesdays in Mississippi,'' a program that \nbrought together Black and White women from the North and South to \ncreate a dialogue of understanding.\n  Throughout her years of public service, Dr. Height has received \nnumerous awards for her pursuit of equality including: the Spingarn \nAward, the highest honor given by the National Association for the \nAdvancement of Colored People, NAACP; the Presidential Medal of \nFreedom, awarded by President Clinton; the William L. Dawson Award, \ngiven by the Congressional Black Caucus for decades of service to \npeople of color and women; the Citizens Medal Award for distinguished \nservice, presented by President Reagan; and her most recent honor, the \nCongressional Gold Medal, presented by the 108th Congress of the United \nStates.\n  Dr. Dorothy Height has been a clear voice in expressing the needs of \nnot only African-American women, but of all women. She is a living \nlegend, a catalyst for growth and positive change in our great country.\n  I proudly congratulate Dr. Dorothy Irene Height on the awarding of \nthe Congressional Gold Medal and for her commitment to equality and \ncivil rights in America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/25/senate-section/article/S3177-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3177]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    THE GREEN STREET BAPTIST CHURCH\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, today I would like to take the \nopportunity to honor the 160th birthday of the Green Street Baptist \nChurch in Louisville, KY.\n  The Green Street Baptist Church is one of the oldest and most \nestablished African-American churches in Kentucky. It has served as a \nspiritual focal point for Louisville since it was founded as the Second \nAfrican Baptist Church by nine slaves. On September 29, 1844 it was \nopened as the Green Street Baptist Church by pastor Brother George \nWells.\n  The Green Street Baptist Church is a historic place that has played a \nsignificant role for African-Americans in Louisville. The present \nchurch was built in 1930 by the noted African-American architect Samuel \nPlato. In August of 1967, with H.W. Jones as pastor, the church hosted \na rally for voter registration led by Dr. Martin Luther King.\n  As one of the U.S. Senators from Kentucky, I know how important a \nwonderful center like the Green Street Baptist Church can be to a \ncommunity. One of the more prominent trustees and a treasurer of the \nchurch was a man named Ben Duke, who lived to be 100 years old. I have \nno doubt that his rewarding involvement with such a great organization \nlike the Green Street Baptist Church contributed to his longevity.\n  I congratulate the Green Street Baptist Church on this momentous \noccasion of its 160th anniversary. I hoe the church will continue to \nserve the Louisville community another 160 years and beyond.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/25/senate-section/article/S3177-2", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3177]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                LEAGUE OF UNITED LATIN AMERICAN CITIZENS\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this year marks the 75th \nAnniversary of the League of United Latino American Citizens, commonly \nknown as LULAC. This national organization was founded in 1929 to fight \nfor the civil rights of all Hispanic Americans. The LULAC founders saw \na need for an organization that would strive for equality, fight \ndiscrimination and injustice, help Hispanics to claim their rights as \nUnited States Citizens and to have access to the American Dream.\n  Due to their success in the southwest, LULAC continued to open up \nchapters all over the United States. LULAC's first council was formed \nin Iowa in 1959 and continues to have a strong presence today. They \nhave prospered over the past 45 years and continue to be a leader in \nIowa, fighting for the rights of Latino Iowans.\n  LULAC has worked to affect national policy so that it better reflects \nthe different cultures living in the United States. They continue to \nwork tirelessly to reduce discrimination, close the achievement gap and \nimprove the immigration laws and system.\n  LULAC seeks to reduce disparities in political representation. They \nwork to develop leaders among the young Latino men and women in Iowa. \nRita Vargas, a previous member of my staff, was nominated as ``LULAC's \nWoman of the Year'' in 2001, and has since been elected to the position \nof Scott County Recorder.\n  The Latino community is a vital, growing part of today's Iowa. In \nthis great country, we find strength in our diversity. Iowa is stronger \neconomically and richer culturally thanks to the many contributions of \nour Latino friends, neighbors and colleagues.\n  I would like to say thank you to LULAC for all their hard work in \nIowa and throughout the country. I wish them the best as they continue \ntheir community activism.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/25/senate-section/article/S3177-3", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3177-S3178]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTRIBUTE TO COLONEL JOELLEN de BERG, UNITED STATES AIR FORCE NURSE CORPS\n\n Mr. INOUYE.

After \nserving as flight nurse, instructor, and evaluator in C-123 and C-130 \naircraft, she entered active duty in July, 1978, at Malcolm Grow \nMedical Center, Andrews Air Force Base, MD. She quickly rose through \nthe ranks and served throughout the world, including in the \nPhilippines, Ohio, California, Oklahoma, Maryland, Illinois, Texas, \nWashington, District of Columbia, and Japan.\n  In each assignment, Colonel de Berg excelled and was rewarded with \ngreater responsibilities. In 1983, her performances led to a below-the-\nzone promotion to the rank of major 3 years ahead of her peers. After \nserving as manager of emergency services at Wright-Patterson AFB, she \ntransitioned from the clinical arena to medical readiness inspector, \nAir Force Inspector General, Norton AFB, CA. Once again, her exemplary \nperformance led to a second below-the-zone promotion to lieutenant \ncolonel. After serving as the associate director of nursing at Malcolm \nGrow Medical Center, she went on to serve as congressional fellow, U.S. \nSenate, Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. Her service in this \ncapacity lead to her appointment as chief of strategic plans, U.S. Air \nForce Surgeon General's Office, Bolling AFB, Washington, DC.\n  With her path to executive leadership clearly set, Colonel de Berg \nserved as chief nurse at Tinker AFB and Andrews AFB. At Andrews, she \nassumed command of the Eighty-ninth Medical Operations Squadron. Her \nremarkable leadership earned her selection as group commander, Thirty-\nfifth Medical Group, Misawa, Japan. Colonel de Berg then assumed \nresponsibilities as command nurse and chief, Primary Care Optimization, \nOffice of the Command Surgeon, Air Mobility Command, Scott AFB, IL.\n  Colonel de Berg's last assignment was in the State she considers \nhome. She returned to Texas, as chief, Nurse Utilization and Education \nBranch, Air Force Personnel Center, Randolph AFB. In this position, she \nwas responsible for managing assignments, career progression, and \nsponsored educational opportunities for 4,000 Air Force nurses.\n  Colonel de Berg is a meritorious leader, administrator, clinician, \neducator, and mentor. Throughout her career she has served with valor \nand profoundly\n\n[[Page S3178]]\n\nimpacted the entire Air Force Medical Service. Her performance reflects \nexceptionally on herself, the United States Air Force, the Department \nof Defense, and the United States of America. I extend my deepest \nappreciation to COL Joellen de Berg on behalf of a grateful Nation for \nmore than 31 years of dedicated military service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/25/senate-section/article/S3178-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3178]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NAVY AIRMAN JUSTIN TEAGUE\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

Teague's job on the flight deck, where he secured \nplanes that had landed and towed them into position, is vital for the \nfunction of the carrier. Justin admits his position was stressful but \nthe hardest thing he had to endure was losing his best friend from home \nin a car accident while at sea.

In this time of conflict, it \nis important to remember the young people who risk their lives to \nensure our freedom.

Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \nextend my congratulations to the American Lung Association as it \ncelebrates its 100th anniversary.\n  One of our Nation's foremost health advocacy groups, the American \nLung Association was established in 1904 as the National Association \nfor the Study and Prevention of Tuberculosis, a cause to which it \nremains very much devoted. From its early years during which it focused \non promoting basic sanitation measures, the ALA has grown into a leader \nin the fields of health education and biomedical research, contributing \nover $11 million in 2003 alone to the study of lung disease.\n  The American Lung Association has long been at the forefront of \nefforts to warn the American public of the dangers of smoking. In fact, \nthe ALA predated the Surgeon General by 4 years in establishing a link \nbetween tobacco use and chronic lung disease, issuing a public health \nstatement on the risks of tobacco use as early as 1960. Subsequent \npublic information campaigns, especially those targeting America's \nyouth, have helped cut smoking rates drastically over the past two \ndecades.\n  In the hope of addressing a root cause of lung disease, the American \nLung Association has worked tirelessly to improve the quality of the \nair we breathe. This organization played a crucial role in the \ndevelopment and implementation of the 1970 Clean Air Act, and since \nthen has provided a strong voice for improving emissions standards and \nreducing children's exposure to poor air quality in schools.\n  Over the years, the American Lung Association has risen time after \ntime to the task of combating new health challenges. Recognizing the \ngrowing problem of asthma, the ALA has initiated a number of programs \nto help local officials, parents, and their children combat and manage \nthis disease. And in 1996, the ALA established their Asthma Clinical \nResearch Center network, a program with an annual budget of $3.5 \nmillion, consisting of 19 university and hospital centers and a \ncoordinating center at the Johns Hopkins University.\n  I commend the ALA for its outstanding achievements over the past \ncentury, and I offer my best wishes for a successful future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/25/senate-section/article/S3178-3", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3178]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          OREGON VETERAN HERO\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, today I rise to honor an Oregon \nveteran who went above and beyond the call of duty in service to his \ncountry. On February 19, 1941, 16-year-old Mike Ryan left high school \nand voluntarily enlisted in the United States Army to serve in World \nWar II.\n  Private Ryan underwent basic training at Fort Mills on Corregidor in \nManila Bay. Japanese bombing attacks on the island intensified and \nultimately led to the fall of Corregidor. U.S. forces surrendered on \nMay 6, 1942. Pvt. Mike Ryan and other troops in the southern part of \nthe Philippines became Japanese prisoners of war.\n  Ryan and hundreds of other prisoners were taken to Manila, were \nparaded through the streets and taken to prison, and transported to a \nprison camp in Cabanatuan, Philippines.\n  For the next 3 years, Mike Ryan suffered immensely, enduring hunger, \nfatigue, and sickness in a Japanese forced labor camp. The conditions \nwere dismal; food and clothing were scarce and the heat was intense. \nAfter spending time in a holding area, which was nothing more than a \ncow pasture with no sanitary facilities, Ryan was sent out on work \ndetails and later transferred to prison.\n  Thirty-seven percent of the prisoners did not survive. Mike says he \nnever gave up hope, saying he always knew he would come back someday. \nOn September 13, 1945, Ryan and his fellow prisoners were released from \ncaptivity. Mike Ryan had spent a total of 3 years, 4 months, and 6 days \nas a prisoner of war.\n  After spending a short time in a military hospital in Denver, CO, \nRyan was honorably discharged from the service on June 20, 1946.\n  On March 30, 1948, he married and moved to Oregon. Mike worked at a \nplywood mill in Lebanon for more than 40 years until it shut down in \n1985. Ryan served as the department commander of American Ex-prisoners \nof War. Now retired, Ryan enjoys spending his time with his wife of 56 \nyears and his family. He has two sons, four grandchildren, and four \ngreat-grandchildren.\n  Mike Ryan made many sacrifices by entering the military at such a \nyoung age. He never had the opportunity to finish high school and \nreceive his diploma. Last session, the Oregon Legislative Assembly \npassed S. 374 allowing World War II veterans who left school to serve \nin the war to receive their high school diploma. Ryan is hoping he will \ngraduate this year with the Lebanon, OR class of 2004.\n  Now 79 years old, Ryan looks back on his life and gratitude, thankful \nfor the opportunity to serve his country.\n  For his selfless service to others, and to the United States in time \nof war, I salute Mike Ryan as an Oregon veteran hero.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/25/senate-section/article/S3178-4", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3178]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   NOTIFICATION OF THE PRESIDENT'S INTENT TO ENTER INTO A FREE TRADE \n     AGREEMENT WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC--PM 74\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Finance:\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Consistent with section 2105(a)(1)(A) of the Trade Act of 2002 \n(Public Law 107-210; the ``Trade Act''), I am pleased to notify the \nCongress of my intent to enter into a free trade agreement (FTA) with \nthe Government of the Dominican Republic.\n  This agreement will create new opportunities for America's workers, \nfarmers, businesses, and consumers by eliminating barriers to trade \nwith the Dominican Republic, the largest economy in the Caribbean \nBasin.

A bill to amend the Environmental Research, Development, and \nDemonstration Authorization Act of 1979 to establish in the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency the position of Deputy Administrator \nfor Science and Technology; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nwith my friend and colleague, Senator Carper, which will strengthen the \nuse of science at the Environmental Protection Agency. By improving \nscience at the Agency, we will be improving the framework of our \nregulatory decisions. It is important that these regulations be \neffective, not onerous and inefficient. To make government regulations \nefficient, they must be based on a solid foundation of scientific \nunderstanding and data.\n  In 2000, the Nation Research Council released a report, \n``Strengthening Science at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency: \nResearch Management and Peer Review Practices'' which outlined current \npractices at the EPA and made recommendations for improving science \nwithin the agency. The bill we are introducing today, the \n``Environmental Research Enhancement Act,'' builds on the NRC report.\n  When the Environmental Protection Agency was created in 1970 by \nPresident Nixon, its mission was set to protect human health and \nsafeguard the environment. In the 1960s, it had become increasingly \nclear that ``we needed to know more about the total environment--land, \nwater, and air.'' The EPA was part of President Nixon's \nreorganizational efforts to effectively ensure the protection, \ndevelopment and enhancement of the total environment.\n  For the EPA to reach this mission, establishing rules and priorities \nfor clean land, air and water require a fundamental understanding of \nthe science behind the real and potential threats to public health and \nthe environment. Unfortunately, many institutions, citizens and groups \nbelieve that science has not always played a significant role in the \ndecision-making process at the EPA.\n  In NRC's 2002 report, it was concluded that, while the use of sound \nscience is one of the Environmental Protection Agency's goals, the EPA \nneeds to change its current structure to allow science to play a more \nsignificant role in decisions made by the Administrator.\n  The legislation we are introducing today looks to address those \nshortcomings at the EPA by implementing portions of the report that \nrequire congressional authorization.\n  Under our bill, a new position, Deputy Administrator for Science and \nTechnology will be established at the EPA. This individual will oversee \nthe Office of Research and Development; the Environmental Information \nAgency; the Science Advisory board; the Science Policy Council; and the \nscientific and technical activities in the regulatory program at the \nEPA. This new position is equal in rank to the current Deputy \nAdministrator and would report directly to the Administrator. The new \nDeputy would be responsible for coordinating scientific research and \napplication between the scientific and regulatory arms of the Agency. \nThis will ensure that sound science is the basis for regulatory \ndecisions. The new Deputy's focus on science could also change how \nenvironmental decisions are made.\n  Assistant Administrator for Research and Development, currently the \ntop science job at the EPA, will be appointed for 6 years versus the \ncurrent 4 years political appointment. Historically, this position is \nrecognized to be one of the EPA's weakest and most transient \nadministrator positions according to NRC's report, even though in my \nview, the position addresses some of the Agency's more important \ntopics. By lengthening the term of this Assistant Administrator \nposition and removing it from the realm of politics, I believe there \nwill be more continuity in the scientific work of the Agency across \nadministrations and allow the Assistant Administrator to focus on \nscience conducted at the Agency.\n  In 1997, we learned the problems that can arise when sound science is \nnot used in making regulatory decisions. Following EPA's ozone and \nparticulate matter regulations there was great uncertainty on the \nscientific side.\n  When intitally releasing the Ozone/PM regulations, the EPA greatly \nover estimated the impacts for both ozone and PM, and they had to \npublicly change their figures later on. Additionally, they selectively \napplied some study results while ignoring others in their calculations. \nFor example, the majority of the health benefits for ozone are based on \none PM study by a Dr. Moogarkar, even though the Agency ignored the PM \nresults of that study because it contradicted their position on PM.\n  The legislation that Senator Carper and I are introducing will ensure \nthat science no longer takes a ``back seat'' at the Environmental \nProtection Agency in terms of policy making.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nensure that prescription drug card sponsors pass along discounts to \nbeneficiaries under the medicare prescription drug discount card and \ntransitional assistance program; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the Medicare Prescription Drug, \nImprovement, and Modernization Act of 2003 created a temporary drug \ndiscount card program. We expect that program to go into effect this \nsummer. Under the new law, it is the only prescription drug assistance \nseniors will see until 2006. And it isn't much. This program has a lot \nof problems and I am very skeptical that it will provide meaningful \nassistance to most beneficiaries.\n  Today, the administration announced which private companies have been \nselected to receive beneficiary enrollment fees and provide the cards \nto beneficiaries. The applicants included\n\n[[Page S3186]]\n\nbig pharmaceutical companies, pharmaceutical benefit managers, and \nHMOs. And the list of approved companies is a who's who of the \ninsurance industry.\n  One of the most glaring problems with the program is that the \nMedicare legislation fails to ensure that these private companies pass \nalong the discounts they negotiate to beneficiaries. Today, I am \nintroducing legislation to remedy that failure. My bill would require \ncard sponsors to pass at least 90 percent of the discounts along to \nbeneficiaries. It seems like common sense, but, true to form, the \nRepublican Medicare bill allows the private companies to keep the \ndiscounts as profits. And the administration's regulations only require \nthat they pass along a ``share'' of the discounts they negotiate. Well, \nI think that's giving them too much leeway.\n  The administration is promising seniors discounts in order to \nconvince them to pay private companies a $30 fee. My bill would ensure \nthat these private companies pass the discounts along to those seniors. \nIt's only fair. The sponsors will still have plenty of room for \nbenefitting from participating in the program--they get the $30 \nenrollment fee and they will be able to retain up to 10 percent of the \nnegotiated price concessions.\n  Despite all the hoopla, the cards themselves are nothing new. Some \nlow-income beneficiaries will see $600 in assistance on their cards, \nand that is real help. Unfortunately, the process for gaining access to \nthat money is so cumbersome, I worry that many will not get it. And I \nhave serious doubts about whether the cards will add any other \nmeaningful assistance. The General Accounting Office has found that \nsimilar cards now available on the market offer discounts on average of \nless than 10 percent--that's about what seniors could save by \ncomparison shopping at local pharmacies.\n  Worse, under the Medicare drug program, seniors will only be able to \nuse one Medicare-endorsed card. Before the program, people could use as \nmany cards as they wanted and compare discounts. And the real kicker is \nthat once seniors pay a fee to participate, they're locked into that \ncard for a year. But the card sponsor isn't locked into anything. It \ncan change everything whenever it wants--even the amount of the \ndiscount or whether a discount is offered on a particular drug.\n  And here's the worst part, this drug card program may already be \nharming all American drug consumers. As the Wall Street Journal noted \njust yesterday, recent drug price increases are eroding even the meager \nsavings the administration predicts. What's more, all Americans are \nalready paying higher drug prices. According to the Wall Street \nJournal, since the Bush administration proposed a Medicare drug card in \n2001, the prices of many drugs the elderly use have ``surged.'' For \nexample, the article notes that since that time, the price of Lescol, a \ncholesterol drug, has increased by more than a third. Similarly, the \nprice for Celebrex, a popular drug for arthritis pain, has risen 23 \npercent since the administration proposed the cards.\n  The administration is claiming the discount cards will result in \nbeneficiary savings of between 10 and 25 percent. But the \npharmaceutical industry's price hikes negate what little savings the \nadministration optimistically predicts. Unfortunately, the discount \ncards are just one example of the new law's failure to address drug \nprices. The Boston University School of Public Health recently found \nthat the new Medicare law could lead to an additional $139 billion in \nprofits for the drug companies. The new law actually prohibits Medicare \nfrom using its negotiating power to obtain lower drug prices for \nseniors. And the reimportation provisions are meaningless. We know from \nexperience that seniors can save much more than 10 to 25 percent by \ngetting their drugs from Canada.\n  As Families USA points out on its website, the drug cards actually \ncreate an incentive for the drug companies to raise their prices: \n``Neither the new law nor the regulations specify the `base prices' to \nwhich discounts will be applied. Any discount will be meaningless if \nthe base price is undefined--especially if the base price continues to \nrise very substantially. It would be like a department store marking up \nprices on products so that it can later offer them `on sale' at \ntremendous `savings.' ''\n  The bill I am introducing addresses only one flaw in a program \nriddled with problems. I feel that it is a critical step. At the very \nleast, we should ensure that if this program does offer some sort of \nprice concession, that Medicare beneficiaries--not private companies \nlike HMOs--are the ones to profit from the results.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord following my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2234\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Hollings)\n\n       Free trade is like world peace--you can't get there by \n     whining about it. You must be willing to fight for it. And \n     the entity to fight for free trade is the U.S. Congress.\n       Instead, Congress--whose members are shouting ``fair \n     trade'' and ``level the playing field''--is the very group \n     tilting the playing field when it comes to trade.\n       By piling items onto the cost of doing business here, \n     Congress has helped end the positive trade balance that the \n     United States ran right up until the early 1980s. Over the \n     past 40 years, the minimum wage went up, the Environmental \n     Protection Agency was established, and the Occupational \n     Safety and Health Administration was set up. Lawmakers added \n     the Equal Pay Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act \n     and the Employment Retirement Income Security Act. Then came \n     the sharp increase in payroll taxes for Social Security in \n     1983, measures requiring plant closing notice and parental \n     leave, and the Americans With Disabilities Act. Health costs \n     increased, too, making it $500 a car cheaper in health costs \n     alone for General Motors to make Pontiacs in Canada. All this \n     helped give us a trade deficit that hit a record $43.1 \n     billion in January alone.\n       Even if wages were equalized, it would still pay for U.S. \n     companies to move operations to places such as China, which \n     requires none of these aspects of America's high standard of \n     living. Recently, columnist George Will wrote: ``The export \n     of jobs frees U.S. workers for tasks where America has a \n     comparative advantage.'' But in global competition, what \n     matters is not the comparative advantage of our ability so \n     much as the comparative disadvantage of our living standard.\n       To really level the playing field in trade would require \n     lowering our living standard, which is not going to happen. \n     We value our clean air and water, our safe factories and \n     machinery, and our rights and benefits. Both Republicans \n     and Democrats overwhelmingly support this living standard \n     and many are prepared to raise its. The only course \n     possible, then, is to protect the standard.\n       To talk in these terms raises cries of ``protectionism.'' \n     But the business of government is protection. The oath of the \n     public servant is ``to preserve, protect and defend.'' We \n     have the Army to protect us from enemies without and the FBI \n     to protect us from enemies within. We have Medicare and \n     Medicaid to protect us from ill health, and Social Security \n     to protect us from poverty in old age. We have the Securities \n     and Exchange Commission to protect us from stock fraud; \n     banking laws to protect us from usurpers; truth in lending \n     laws to protect us from charlatans.\n       When it comes to trade, however, multinational corporations \n     contend that we do not need to protect, but to educate and to \n     improve skills; productivity is the problem, they say. But \n     the United States is the most productive industrial nation in \n     the world, with skills galore. BMW is producing better-\n     quality cars in South Carolina than in Munich. There are \n     other obstacles that need addressing. For 50 years we have \n     tried to penetrate the Japanese market, but have barely done \n     so. To sell textiles in Korea, U.S. firms must first obtain \n     permission from the private Korean textile industry. If you \n     want to sell in China, it's a lot easier if you produce in \n     China.\n       ``But we will start a trade war,'' is the cry. Wake up! We \n     have been in a trade for more than 200 years. And it's the \n     United States that started it! Just after the colonies won \n     their freedom, the mother country suggested that the United \n     States trade what we produced best and, in exchange, Britain \n     would trade back with what it produced best--as economist \n     David Ricardo later described in this theory of ``comparative \n     advantage.'' Alexander Hamilton, in his famous ``Report on \n     Manufactures,'' told the Brits, in so many words, to bug off. \n     He said, we are not going to remain your colony shipping you \n     our natural resources--rice, cotton, indigo, timber, iron \n     or--and importing your manufactured products. We are going to \n     build our own manufacturing capacity.\n       The second bill ever adopted by Congress, on July 4, 1789, \n     was a 50 percent tariff on numerous articles. This policy of \n     protectionism, endorsed by James Madison and Thomas \n     Jefferson, continued under President Lincoln when he launched \n     America's steel industry by refusing to import from England \n     the steel for the Transcontinental Railroad. President \n     Franklin Roosevelt protected agriculture, President \n     Eisenhower protected oil and President Kennedy protected \n     textiles. This economic and industrial giant, the United \n     States, was built on protectionism and, for more than a \n     century, financed it with tariffs. And it worked.\n       The Washington mantra of ``retrain, retrain'' comes up \n     short. For example, Oneita Industries closed its T-shirt \n     plant in Andrews, SC, back in 1999. The plant had 487 \n     employees averaging 47 years of age. Let's assume they were \n     ``retrained'' and became 487 skilled computer operators. Who \n     is going to hire a 47-year-old operator over a 21-year-old \n     operator? No one is going to take on the retirement and \n     health costs of the 47-year-old. Moreover, that computer job \n     probably just left for Bangalore, India.\n       In global competition there is a clash between standards of \n     living. I supported free trade with Canada because we have \n     relatively the same standard of living. But I opposed free \n     trade with Mexico, and therefore voted against the North \n     American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), preferring to raise \n     the standards in Mexico, as Europe did with Portugal, Spain \n     and Greece before admitting them to Europe's common market. \n     To be eligible for a tree trade agreement you should first \n     have a free market, labor rights, ownership of property, \n     contract rights of appeal and a respected judiciary. Mexico \n     lacked these, and after NAFTA there was an immediate flow of \n     jobs out of the United States because of Mexico's lesser \n     standards. Australia, on the other hand, has labor rights, \n     environmental rights and an open market, so the trade \n     agreement reached with Australia this month should be \n     approved.\n       We must engage in competitive trade. To eliminate a \n     barrier, raise a barrier. Then eliminate them both.\n       Our trouble is that we have treated trade as aid. After \n     World War II, we were the only country with industry, and in \n     order to prosper we needed to spread prosperity. Through the \n     Marshall Plan, we sent money, equipment and expertise to \n     Europe and the Pacific Rim. And it worked. Capitalism \n     defeated communism in the Cold War. Our hope in crying ``free \n     trade'' was that markets would remain open for our exports. \n     But our cries went unheeded, and now our Nation's security is \n     in jeopardy.\n       National security is like a three-legged stool. The first \n     leg--values--is solid. Our stand for freedom and democracy is \n     respected around the world. The second leg of military \n     strength is unquestioned. But the third leg, economic leg, is \n     fractured and needs repair. We are losing jobs faster than we \n     can create them. Some time ago the late Akio Morita, founder \n     of Sony Corp., was lecturing leaders of third-world \n     countries, admonishing them to develop their manufacturing \n     capacity to become nation states. Then, pointing at me in the \n     audience, he stated, ``That world power that loses its \n     manufacturing capacity will cease to be a world power.''\n\n[[Page S3189]]\n\n       What should we do? First, we need to stop financing the \n     elimination of jobs. Tax benefits for offshore production \n     must end. Royalty deductions allowed for offshore activities \n     must be eliminated, and tax havens for corporations must be \n     closed down.\n       Next, we need an assistant attorney general to enforce our \n     trade laws and agreements. At present, enforcement is largely \n     left to an injured party. It can take years to jump over \n     legal hurdles. Then at the end, based on national security, \n     the president can refuse to implement a court order. Rather \n     than waste time and money, corporate America has moved \n     offshore.\n       We need to organize government to produce and protect jobs, \n     rather than export them. The Commerce Department recently co-\n     sponsored a New York seminar, part of which advised companies \n     on how to move jobs offshore. This aid for exporting jobs \n     must stop. The Department of Commerce should be reconstituted \n     as a Department of Trade and Commerce, with the secretary as \n     czar over the U.S. trade representative. The department's \n     International Trade Administration should determine not only \n     whether goods have been dumped on the U.S. market, but how \n     big the ``injury'' is to U.S. industry. The International \n     Trade Commission should be eliminated.\n       While it is illegal to sell foreign-made goods below cost \n     in the U.S. market (a practice called dumping), we refuse to \n     enforce such violations. The Treasury Department reports $2 \n     billion worth of illegal transshipments of textiles into the \n     United States each year. Customs agents charged with drug \n     enforcement and homeland security are hard-pressed to stop \n     these transshipments. We need at lead at 1,000 additional \n     Customs agents.\n       It won't be easy. A culture of free trade has developed. \n     The big banks that make most of their money outside the \n     country, as well as the Business Roundtable, the Conference \n     Board, the National Association of Manufacturers, the U.S. \n     Chamber of Commerce, the National Retail Federation (whose \n     members make bigger profits on imported articles) and the \n     editorial writers of newspapers that make most of their \n     profits from retail ads--all these descend on Washington \n     promoting ``free trade'' to members of Congress. Members \n     looking for contributions shout the loudest.\n       Not just jobs, but also the middle class and the strength \n     of our very democracy are in jeopardy. As Lincoln said, ``The \n     dogmas of the quiet past, are inadequate to the stormy \n     present. . . . As our case is new, so we must think anew, and \n     act anew. We must disenthrall ourselves, and then we shall \n     save our country.''\n       Today's dogma is the belief that protectionism will mean \n     trade war and economic stagnation. But we are already in a \n     trade war, one from which the president and the Congress are \n     AWOL.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself and Mr. Hatch):\n  S. 2237. A bill to amend chapter 5 of title 17, United States Code, \nto authorize civil copyright enforcement by the Attorney General, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the advent of the digital age promises the \nefficient distribution of music, films, books, and software on the \nInternet, and an easily-accessed, unprecedented variety of content \nonline. Unfortunately, to see this promise realized, we must overcome \nsome of the challenges presented by digital content distribution. Today \nI am pleased that Senator Hatch is joining me in sponsoring the \n``Protecting Intellectual Rights Against Theft and Expropriation \n(PIRATE) Act of 2004,'' which will respond to one such challenge. It \nwill bring the resources and expertise of the United States Attorneys' \nOffices to bear on wholesale copyright infringers.\n  The very ease of duplication and distribution that is the hallmark of \ndigital content has meant that piracy of that content is just as easy. \nThe very real--and often realized--threat that creative works will \nsimply be duplicated and distributed freely online has restricted, \nrather than enhanced, the amount and variety of creative works one can \nreceive over the Internet. Part of combating piracy includes offering a \nlegal alternative to it. Another important part is enforcing the rights \nof copyright owners. Senator Hatch and I have been working with \nartists, authors, and software developers to create an environment in \nwhich copyright is protected, so that we can all enjoy American \ncreativity, and so that copyright owners can be paid for their work.\n  For too long, Federal prosecutors have been hindered in their pursuit \nof pirates, by the fact that they were limited to bringing criminal \ncharges with high burdens of proof. In the world of copyright, a \ncriminal charge is unusually difficult to prove because the defendant \nmust have known that his conduct was illegal and he must have willfully \nengaged in the conduct anyway. For this reason prosecutors can rarely \njustify bringing criminal charges, and copyright owners have been left \nalone to fend for themselves, defending their rights only where they \ncan afford to do so. In a world in which a computer and an Internet \nconnection are all the tools you need to engage in massive piracy, this \nis an intolerable predicament.\n  Some steps have already been taken. The Allen-Leahy Amendment to the \nForeign Operations Appropriations Bill, on Combating Piracy of U.S. \nIntellectual Property in Foreign Countries, provided $2.5 million for \nthe Department of State to assist foreign countries in combating piracy \nof U.S. copyright works. By providing equipment and training to law \nenforcement officers, it will help those countries that are not members \nof OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation & Development) to \nenforce intellectual property protections.\n  The PIRATE Act will give the Attorney General civil enforcement \nauthority for copyright infringement. It also calls on the Justice \nDepartment to initiate training and pilot programs to ensure that \nFederal prosecutors across the country are aware of the many difficult \ntechnical and strategic problems posed by enforcing copyright law in \nthe digital age.\n  This new authority does not supplant either the criminal provisions \nof the Copyright Act, or the remedies available to the copyright owner \nin a private suit. Rather, it allows the government to bring its \nresources to bear on this immense problem, and to ensure that more \ncreative works are made available online, that those works are more \naffordable, and that the people who work to bring them to us are paid \nfor their efforts.\n  The challenges presented by digital content are multifaceted, and no \nsingle response will resolve all of them. We must, and we will, offer a \nbroad array of solutions that taken together will help ensure the \nprotection of intellectual property, encourage the deployment of \ndigital content, and allow technology to develop unimpeded. This bill \nis just one step in this process. I am working with colleagues, members \nof the private sector, and officials from the Executive Branch, to \ncraft careful and effective responses to other such challenges in the \nintellectual property arenas.\n  I hope that my colleagues support the ``Protecting Intellectual \nRights Against Theft and Expropriation (PIRATE) Act of 2004,'' and I \nask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2237\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Protecting Intellectual \n     Rights Against Theft and Expropriation Act of 2004''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Mr. President, I rise to join Senator Leahy in sponsoring \nthe Protecting Intellectual Rights Against Theft and Expropriation \nAct--the ``PIRATE Act''--a measure that will provide the Department of \nJustice with tools to combat the rampant copyright piracy facilitated \nby peer-to-peer filesharing software.\n  Let me underscore at the outset that our bill does not expand the \nscope of the existing powers of the Department of Justice to prosecute \npersons who infringe copyrights. Instead, our proposal will assist the \nDepartment in exercising existing enforcement powers through a civil \nenforcement mechanism. After considerable study, we have concluded that \nthis is the most appropriate mechanism.\n  Peer-to-peer file sharing software has created a dilemma for law-\nenforcement agencies. Millions of otherwise law-abiding American \ncitizens are using this software to create and redistribute infringing \ncopies of popular music, movies, computer games and software.\n  Some who copy these works do not fully understand the illegality, or \nperhaps the serious consequences, of their infringing activities. This \ngroup of filesharers should not be the focus of federal law-enforcement \nefforts. Quite frankly, the distributors of most filesharing software \nhave failed to adequately educate the children and young people who use \ntheir software about its legal and illegal uses.\n  A second group of filesharers consists of those who copy and \nredistribute copyrighted works even though they do know that doing so \nviolates federal law. In many cases, these are college students or \nyoung people who think that they will not get caught. Many of these \nfilesharers are engaging in acts that could now subject them to federal \ncriminal prosecution for copyright piracy.\n  It is critical that we bring the moral force of the government to \nbear against those who knowingly violate the federal copyrights \nenshrined in our Constitution. But many of us remain concerned that \nusing criminal law enforcement remedies to act against these infringers \ncould have an overly-harsh effect, perhaps, for example, putting \nthousands of otherwise law-abiding teenagers and college students in \njail and branding them with the lifelong stigma of a felony criminal \nconviction.\n  The bill I join Senator Leahy in sponsoring today will allow the \nDepartment of Justice to supplement its existing criminal-enforcement \npowers through the new civil-enforcement mechanism. As a result, the \nDepartment will be able to impose stiff penalties for violating \ncopyrights, but can avoid criminal action when warranted.\n  In advancing this measure, I must note that I view this civil-\nenforcement authority as another tool, hopefully a transitional tool at \nthat. In the long run, I believe that we must find better mechanisms to \nensure that our most vulnerable citizens--our children--are not being \nconstantly tempted to infringe the copyrights that have made America a \nworld leader in the production of creative works.\n  Only recently has America faced the specter of widespread copyright-\nenforcement actions against individual users of copyrighted works. For \nnearly 200 years, copyright enforcement was rarely directed against the \nmillions of ordinary American citizens who use and enjoy copyrighted \nworks. Instead, creators and distributors of copyrighted content worked \ntogether to negotiate the complex licensing agreements and \ntechnological protections needed to distribute copyrighted works in \nways that accommodated both the expectations of users and the \ncopyrights of artists.\n  But recently, some unscrupulous corporations may have exploited new \ntechnologies and discovered that the narrow scope of civil contributory \nliability for copyright infringement can be utilized so that ordinary \nconsumers and children become, in effect, ``human shields'' against \ncopyright owners and law enforcement agencies. Unscrupulous \ncorporations could distribute to children and students a ``piracy \nmachine'' designed to tempt them to engage in copyright piracy or \npornography distribution.\n  Unfortuantely, piracy and pornography could then become the \ncornerstones of a ``business model.'' At first, children and students \nwould be tempted to infringe copyrights or redistribute pornography. \nTheir illicit activities then generate huge advertising revenues for \nthe architects of piracy. Those children and students then become \n``human shields'' against enforcement efforts that would disrupt the \nflow of those revenues. Later, large user-bases and the threat of more \npiracy would become levers to force American artists to enter licensing \nagreements in which they pay the architects of piracy to distribute and \nprotect their works on the Internet.\n  Federal enforcement action is surely warranted if such ``business \nmodels''\n\n[[Page S3191]]\n\nare driving the increasing ease of piracy on peer-to-peer filesharing \nnetworks. Such business models exploit children, cheat artists, and \nthreaten the future development of commerce on the Internet.\n  Indeed, our government recognizes that its enforcement powers are \nappropriate when protecting intellectual property and public safety. \nRecently, in a speech to the United States Chamber of Commerce, Deputy \nAttorney General James B. Comey, Jr. asserted that the Department of \nJustice should assist private enforcement of intellectual property \nrights if any of three criteria are met: (1) the level of piracy \nbecomes particularly egregious; (2) public health and safety are put at \nrisk; or (3) private civil remedies fail to adequately deter illegal \nconduct.\n  In the case of peer-to-peer filesharing, all three criteria may be \nmet. The level of piracy on these networks is not merely egregious, it \nis unprecedented. Public health and safety are also directly threatened \nby business models that tempt children toward piracy and pornography \nand then use them as ``human shields'' against law enforcement.\n  Finally, the recording industry and other affected rights holders \nhave tried--so far largely unsuccessfully--to use civil remedies to \nhalt the operations of those who would profit by turning teenagers and \ncollege students into copyright pirates or pornography distributors.\n  As a result, our creative industries' only remaining option to deter \npiracy is to bring enough civil enforcement actions against users of \nfilesharing software. Tens of thousands of continuing civil enforcement \nactions might be needed to generate the necessary deterrence. I doubt \nthat any nongovernmental organization has the resources or moral \nauthority to pursue such a campaign.\n  If enforcement actions against end-users were really the best or only \nway to enforce copyrights on the Internet, then civil enforcement \nauthority would be necessary. But there may be other ways to combat \nthis piracy at the root, not at the branch. I thus invite the \nDepartment of Justice and other federal law enforcement agencies to \nwork with me, Senator Leahy and other members of the Judiciary \nCommittee to determine how the enforcement powers of the federal \ngovernment can best be deployed to solve the problems arising from \npiracy and pornography on peer-to-peer filesharing networks.\n  I also understand that others may be developing proposals to increase \ncriminal enforcement authority against piracy, and I hope to work with \nthem on such proposals. Today, I stand with Senator Leahy to buttress \nthe enforcement of copyrights by enabling the Department of Justice to \nproceed with a robust program of civil enforcement.\n  For the reasons I have just delineated, I urge my colleagues to join \nus in supporting the Protecting Intellectual Rights Against Theft and \nExpropriation Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER:\n  S. 2240. A bill to improve seaport security; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, at the end of 2002, the Maritime \nTransportation Security Act became law.\n  I was a member of the conference committee on that bill, and I think \nit was a good first step in improving security at our nation's ports.\n  It had many good provisions, such as the creation of national and \nregional maritime transportation/port security plans to be approved by \nthe Coast Guard; better coordination of federal, state, local, and \nprivate enforcement agencies; and the establishment of a grant program \nfor port authorities, waterfront facilities operators, and state and \nlocal agencies to provide security infrastructure improvements.\n  The problem was that the bill had no guaranteed funding mechanism. As \na result, we are underfunding port security. Since the passage of the \nMaritime Transportation Security Act, the Department of Homeland \nSecurity has released $517 million in port security grants. This is not \nenough. According to the Coast Guard, it is estimated that the ports \ndirectly need $1.4 billion this year and $6 billion over the next ten \nyears. Yet, the Administration only requested $46 million in its fiscal \nyear 2005 budget.\n  Last year, I visited many of California's ports including Crescent \nCity in the north down through Stockton to Los Angeles/Long Beach in \nthe south. I have seen what the ports are confronting. They need more \nfunding for homeland security.\n  And, with over 40 percent of the nation's goods imported through \nCalifornia's ports, freight rail is extremely important to the nation's \ncommerce. A terrorist attack at a California port would not only be \ntragic but would be devastating for our nation's economy.\n  So, today, I am introducing the Senate version of a bill introduced \nby Representative Millender-McDonald. This legislation will provide \nmore funding to the ports. Specifically, it will: create a Port \nSecurity Grant Program in the Department of Homeland Security; provide \n$800 million per year for five years in grant funding; and--this is \nvery important to California's ports--allow the federal government to \nmake multiyear grants to help finance larger projects similar to what \nis done with many of our airports for aviation security.\n  I hope that the Senate will act on this bill. Now is not the time to \nslow down or delay our efforts to increase and improve transportation \nsecurity. The job is not done, and it must be done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/25/senate-section/article/S3191-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3191-S3192]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 324--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE RELATING TO \n    THE EXTRAORDINARY CONTRIBUTIONS RESULTING FROM THE HUBBLE SPACE \n  TELESCOPE TO SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND EDUCATION, AND TO THE NEED TO \n    RECONSIDER FUTURE SERVICE MISSIONS TO THE HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI (for herself and Mr. Brownback) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation:\n\n                              S. Res. 324\n\n       Whereas discoveries from the Hubble Space Telescope have \n     dominated space science news over the last 10 years;\n       Whereas the Hubble Space Telescope has provided proof of \n     black holes, insights into the birth and death of stars, \n     spectacular views of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9's collision with \n     Jupiter, the age of the Universe, and evidence that the \n     expansion of the Universe is accelerating;\n       Whereas the inspiring scientific discoveries from the \n     Hubble Space Telescope reach millions of students each year \n     and have been important in encouraging students to study the \n     sciences;\n       Whereas the inspiring scientific discoveries from the \n     Hubble Space Telescope reach millions of students each year \n     and have been important in encouraging students to study the \n     sciences;\n       Whereas the 2000 National Academy of Sciences Decadal \n     Survey endorsed a plan to maintain the Hubble Space Telescope \n     until 2010;\n       Whereas the Hubble Space Telescope has been the National \n     Aeronautics and Space Administration's most scientifically \n     productive mission, accounting for 35 percent of all National \n     Aeronautics and Space Administration discoveries in the last \n     20 years;\n       Whereas the demand for research time on the Hubble Space \n     Telescope in 2003 was approximately 8 times that available;\n       Whereas approximately $200,000,000 worth of instruments \n     have largely been built, including scientific instruments \n     that would provide significant improvements in Hubble's \n     scientific power and including replacement gyroscopes and \n     batteries, which could keep the telescope in operation until \n     2011 or 2012 and make the Hubble Space Telescope's final \n     years its most scientifically capable and productive;\n       Whereas the distinguished panel that studied scientific \n     priorities for ultraviolet and optical astronomy in 2003 \n     considered the continued operation of the Hubble Space \n     Telescope by means of the SM-4 servicing mission to be its \n     highest priority; and\n       Whereas the American Astronomical Society, the largest \n     professional scientific association for astronomers and \n     astrophysicists, believes a panel of experts should review \n     the decision to limit prematurely the lifespan of the Hubble \n     Space Telescope: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the extraordinary contributions resulting \n     from the Hubble Space Telescope to scientific research and \n     education;\n       (2) strongly recommends that the Administrator of the \n     National Aeronautics and Space Administration appoint an \n     independent panel of expert scientists and engineers inside \n     and outside of the National Aeronautics\n\n[[Page S3192]]\n\n     and Space Administration to examine all possible options for \n     safely carrying out the planned servicing mission to the \n     Hubble Space Telescope and assess alternative servicing \n     methods; and\n       (3) expresses its strong sentiment that the National \n     Aeronautics and Space Administration should continue all \n     planning, preparation, and astronaut training activities for \n     the SM-4 servicing mission without interruption until the \n     expert panel issues its report and until the National \n     Aeronautics and Space Administration provides a timetable of \n     compliance with recommendation R6.4-1 of the Columbia \n     Accident Investigation Board report, which calls for ``a \n     fully autonomous capability for all missions to address the \n     possibility that an International Space Station mission fails \n     to achieve the correct orbit, fails to dock successfully, or \n     is damaged during or after undocking'', since National \n     Aeronautics and Space Administration compliance with the \n     recommendation will allow both a Hubble servicing mission and \n     missions to the International Space Station to be carried out \n     safely.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to submit a Senate Resolution \nwith my distinguished colleague from Kansas, Senator Brownback. This \nResolution expresses the desire of the Senate for NASA to undertake a \ncomprehensive independent review of the decision to terminate the final \nservicing mission for the Hubble Space Telescope and that all planning \nand preparation activities continue during this period.\n  On January 14, 2004, the NASA Administrator announced that he was \nterminating the final servicing mission for the Hubble Telescope that \nwas scheduled to be launched in 2007.\n  When the NASA Administrator announced his decision, I was shocked. \nHubble has been the most successful NASA program since Apollo. In fact, \nit is arguably the greatest scientific instrument since Galileo's \ntelescope.\n  Pictures from Hubble have helped scientists prove that the universe \nis expanding, that black holes exist, and how stars are born and how \nstars die.\n  Earlier this month, the Space Telescope Science Institute released \nwhat may be considered the greatest photograph ever taken of the \nuniverse. It is a picture showing what the universe was like almost 12 \nbillion years ago. Galaxies and stars never seen before are shown in \nextraordinary detail that will usher in a new era of discovery for \nyears to come.\n  With the scientific value of Hubble undisputed, I was shocked that \nthere was no report, analysis or study that supported the \nAdministrator's decision.\n  It is imperative that we have a full understanding of all the issues, \nincluding the potential risks, scientific benefits and alternative \nservicing methods for a Hubble servicing mission. This decision is too \nimportant to be left to just one person. We need the best advice from \nthe best minds to determine Hubble's future.\n  Let me be clear. I want to stand up for Hubble. I will always stand \nup for the safety of our astronauts. We must do everything possible to \nensure the safety of our astronauts, whether they are traveling to the \nSpace Station or fixing Hubble. Putting safety first means that NASA \nmust fully implement all of the recommendations of the Columbia \nAccident Investigation Board as soon as possible. As the Ranking Member \nof the Appropriations Subcommittee that funds NASA, working on a bi-\npartisan basis with my distinguished colleague from Missouri, Senator \nBond, we are committed to providing whatever resources are needed to \nensure that safety of our astronauts and the safety of the Space \nShuttle.\n  Before an irrevocable decision is made about Hubble's future, I want \nthe best minds in science and engineering to tell us what are the risks \nand how can we reduce them.\n  I know many of my colleagues share these concerns. That's why Senator \nBrownback and I are submitting this resolution today. The decision to \nterminate the Hubble servicing mission represents a major change in our \nscience and space policies. Congress, the American people and the world \ndeserve nothing less than a rigorous and independent review so we can \nfully understand all of the issues surrounding a servicing mission.\n  Finally, I want to thank the outstanding employees of the Goddard \nSpace Flight Center and Space Telescope Science Institute. Without \ntheir hard work and dedication to the cause of science, exploration and \ndiscovery, Hubble would not be what it is today, the greatest \nscientific instrument mankind has ever created.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I recognize the significant scientific \naccomplishments of the Hubble Space Telescope. Space telescopes such as \nHubble are an important part of our future space program and the \nPresident's vision for revitalized human exploration of space.\n  Several months ago NASA made a decision to forego planned Space \nShuttle servicing missions for the Hubble Space Telescope. This is a \ndifficult and complicated issue and technical experts reasonably differ \non the best approach. I believe that NASA might benefit from the \ncounsel of the best experts the nation can muster inside and outside of \nthe Government. Correspondingly, I've joined my colleague Senator \nMikulski in urging NASA to sponsor a comprehensive study on the full \nrange of options and risks associated with various approaches for \nmaintaining the Hubble Space Telescope and its capabilities. I would \nalso hope that this study would include imaginative new concepts for \nrobotic servicing.\n  As we fulfill the promise of space exploration the President has \noutlined, the enormous success of the Hubble Space Telescope and other \nNASA successes such as the recent Mars Rover Program provide us with a \nsound basis upon which to build. NASA can count on my continued support \nof their endeavors to provide unlimited opportunity to future \ngenerations of Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/25/senate-section/article/S3192-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3192]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2936.
