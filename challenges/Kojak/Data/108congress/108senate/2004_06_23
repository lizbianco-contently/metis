Mr. President, this morning we resume consideration of the \nDefense authorization bill. The agreement last night provides for \ndebate on five amendments prior to the votes in relation to those \namendments. Those amendments are the Corzine amendment on Reserve \nretirement, the McConnell amendment and Kennedy amendment on an Iraq \nreport, the Reed amendment on missile defense, and the Byrd amendment \non troop cap.\n  If all debate time on these amendments is used, we will proceed to a \nseries of votes at approximately 11:15 this morning. I had originally \nhoped and expected we would be voting on final passage of the Defense \nbill this morning. Unfortunately, we have not been able to reach an \nagreement providing for the Senate to complete the bill. Therefore, \nlast night I filed a cloture motion in the event we don't complete the \nbill. Our intention is to complete the bill this afternoon.\n  If we are unable to complete the Defense bill, that cloture vote \nwould occur tomorrow. This is the fourth week of consideration of the \nDefense authorization, and it is time for us to finish the bill. I \nthink we are proceeding along those lines.\n  I remind my colleagues that if a cloture vote occurs and the Senate \nvotes cloture, germane amendments will still be in order in addition to \nan additional 30 hours of debate. It is vitally important that we \nconsider the Defense appropriations bill this week, which will ensure \nour troops have the appropriate resources available to them. We need to \nbegin this appropriations process, and I will be seeking an agreement \non the Defense appropriations bill this week before the recess.\n  I add we will have additional judicial nominations today and into the \nevening, if necessary. We need to have those votes. We still have nine \nnominees who are to be considered on the floor and voted upon. These \nunanimous votes clearly will consume valuable Senate time and it may be \nnecessary to have these votes into the evening to ensure we process \nthese judicial nominations.\n  Finally, we have an additional 23 ambassadorships and U.N. \nRepresentatives which are now available on the calendar. Included on \nthis list is the nomination of one of our former colleagues, Jack \nDanforth, to be our Ambassador to the U.N. These are vitally important \nnominations to act on. We need to do that expeditiously. We have had a \nblanket objection to executive nominations, but I believe these \ndiplomatic nominations should not be held up for unrelated issues.\n  I have heard there may be debate necessary on the Danforth \nnomination. I hope we can look at a reasonable amount of time, or we \nwill be here late at night, or we will have to delay the start of the \nrecess in order to vote on these important nominations.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. FRIST. Yes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/23/senate-section/article/S7203-6", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7203]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNITION OF THE ACTING MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, we on this side want to finish this bill. In \nfact, last night, as we indicated, we agreed to shorten the time to the \nfive amendments that are pending. We want to move forward. We feel we \ncan finish this bill. One of the suggestions--and I have not had a \nchance to talk to the managers--but rather than having the votes after \nthis stack, we can have another series of amendments when we\n\n[[Page S7204]]\n\nfinish debate on these, so we would not be interrupted continually with \nvotes.\n\n  We are going to do everything within our power to complete this bill \nas quickly today as possible. There has been this contentious issue \nraised dealing with delaying amendments. This is not going to hold up \nthis bill. We believe we can dispose of these amendments in a \nrelatively short period of time and go to final passage. The Leahy \namendment should not hold up this bill. We have cooperated, we feel, \nimmeasurably. We started out with about 300 amendments, and we have \ncompleted work on these. We are waiting to go. We hope the time is \nshortened, and we will move forward and do the best we can.\n  I apologize to my friend from Massachusetts. He has a question to \nask.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes. One of the amendments we were considering yesterday \nwas the Reid amendment, offered on behalf of the Senator from Vermont, \nmyself, and other members of the Judiciary Committee, about getting \ncertain reports we have not been able to receive yet. I am wondering, \nsince it is still in order, whether we are going to have an opportunity \nto address that issue in a short time discussion or debate, or is it \nthe position of the majority leader that we are not going to have an \nopportunity to have that amendment offered and considered and voted on \nand disposed of?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in response, through the Chair, that \ndiscussion continued last night with the managers as to how that \nparticular amendment is handled. What we did do last night, so we can \ncontinue business, is agree upon the five we laid out. No commitments \nhave been made, at least from the leadership level, in terms of \nparticular amendments that are out there.\n  So I suggest right now, or after you complete your remarks, getting \ntogether with the managers of the bill. Right now the only agreement is \nwe will continue straight ahead with these five amendments and keep the \nball rolling.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for his \nwillingness to move ahead. There are a number of us who are going to \ninsist we at least have an opportunity to offer that amendment and \naddress it at some time. I know I can speak for the Senator from \nVermont, and he would be willing to enter into a short time agreement. \nIt is a matter of enormous importance and consequence involving, we \nbelieve, the security of American troops because that is what the \nGeneva Conventions are all about: protecting American troops.\n  It is important on an issue of this importance and consequence that \nwe move toward final conclusion, that we have a resolution of that \nissue. As a matter of fact, it is, I believe, imperative.\n  I thank the majority leader. We will find how we can deal with this \nissue over the course of the day. I thank our leader as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/23/senate-section/article/S7204-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7204]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I see the proponent of the first amendment on the \nfloor, and we are prepared to engage. So at this time, I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3303\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3303 and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The amendment is pending. The Senator is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nMurray from Washington be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, this amendment is very simple, but very \nimportant for those who serve us so well and so ably across the globe. \nIt is an amendment that will lower the retirement age for National \nGuard and Reserve troops from 60 to 55. During this critical time when \nso many members of the Guard and Reserve are serving bravely in Iraq, \nAfghanistan, and elsewhere, I think this is the least we can do.\n  We are moving the retirement age to match up with the civilian \nretirement age in the country. The current retirement age was \nestablished 50 years ago at a time when it neared civil service \nretirement age. In the intermediate time, we have lowered civil service \nretirement age to 55, but we left Guard and Reserves at 60. It does not \nmake sense that we are treating civilian Federal employees differently \nthan we are treating reservists, particularly, I will point out, in a \nchanged security situation.\n  Because the world has changed so dramatically since the cold war, our \nGuard and Reserves have a very different role today than they did \nduring that time period. I have a chart that shows in stark terms what \nhas actually happened with deployment of our Guard and Reserve members. \nThis is the number of major contingencies and operations with Reserve \nparticipation. From 1953 to 1990, there were 11 callups. From 1991 to \n2001, there were 50. I think all of us know how seriously our Guard and \nReserve are involved in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  They truly have become an integral part and contributor of our \nNation's defense on the front lines. Not coming into the Reserve \ntraining centers once a month, 2 weeks on a summer's day, but they are \non the front lines defending America day in and day out, and I think it \nis time we recognize that and made some adjustments to 50-year-old \npolicies.\n  Considering the demands we are placing on our ready Reserve right \nnow, not only do they make up 46 percent of our uniformed Armed Forces \npersonnel, they are especially important in areas of expertise most \npertinent to the stabilization and nation-building missions in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. Guard and Reserves count for 97 percent of military civil \naffairs units--think of what we are using them for in Afghanistan--and \n70 percent of engineering units. Think of what we are trying to do with \nregard to reconstruction in both Afghanistan and Iraq. And 66 percent \nof our military police.\n  As a matter of fact, they just called up a National Guard unit in my \nhome State of New Jersey. They sent out about 100 folks to Guantanamo. \nIt is incredible how we are using over and over our Guard and \nreservists for the very functions we need in the new world we are \nfacing.\n  As we all know, mobilization is up dramatically. More than 160,000 \nReserve personnel are now on active duty. Last year, the number of \nReserves was more than 400 percent what it had been 4 years earlier--a \n400-percent increase in the number of reservists on duty relative to 4 \nyears ago. Again, the number of deployments is exploding, whether it is \nin Haiti, Afghanistan, Bosnia, or Kosovo. Name it, that is where we are \nusing these folks day in and day out.\n  Reservists are serving longer durations as well. Last year the \naverage duration was 319 days for the reservists and guardsmen. That, \nby the way, only included those who completed their assignments. \nThat is looking at the folks who had been sent back home. That does not \ntake into account the extended time many of those on call are serving.\n\n  With some 140,000 troops currently serving in Iraq and 40 percent of \nGuard and Reserves, it is clear we are relying more and more on these \nbrave Americans, more than at any time in the recent past.\n  The next chart I have demonstrates one component of our Reserve \nforces, the Army National Guard. By the way, in New Jersey, we have \nabout 7,000 of the 9,000 National Guard folks on call, just as a \nbackdrop--7,000 out of the 9,000. Until the end of 2002, the number of \nmobilized personnel was relatively stable at 20,000, which is what we \nsee on this chart. After that, it exploded upward. It was about 70,000 \nwhen I last brought up this proposal when we were discussing the Iraq \nsupplemental last year, and it is up 20,000 which, by the way, was in \nthe October period, and now it has gone up another 24,000, to almost \n95,000 National Guard personnel mobilized in the service of the Nation.\n  It is clear our Reserve forces are no longer a part-time force. This \nis not sideline work. We have entered a new era where a larger number \nof troops will be deployed for long periods of time, and our policies \nneed to change. We have a 50-year-old policy, one that does not even \nmatch up with our civilian retirement age. I think our National Guard \nand Reserve units have made an unbelievably important contribution, and \nwe need to reflect that in our policies as we go forward.\n  That is what this amendment is about. I know the problems facing the \nGuard and Reserve because I have talked with a lot of these folks \nmyself. There are 303 Guard and Reserve members from my State of New \nJersey who are over the age of 55, fifty-five of whom have already been \ndeployed. Additionally, there is a large swath of folks in that 45-to-\n55 age bracket. These people would like to have responses.\n  To make this a little more personal, 2 weeks ago Saturday, we lost \nGuard folks in Iraq. One was 51, and one was 46. These were people who \nhad made long-term commitments to serve our Nation. They were wonderful \npeople with great life stories about how they participated in the \ncommunity.\n  I went out to Walter Reed, and there were seven of New Jersey Guard \nfolks who were injured in the same firefight.\n  You do not meet braver people, and they are performing and \nsacrificing the same way our other troops are. They have a contingent \nrisk, and they have all kinds of interference in their lives. Why are \nwe not addressing some of the fundamental needs these individuals have \nthat are at least the same as our civilian employees? I feel \npassionately that we need to respond to what has changed in how we \noperate our military forces as we go forward.\n  I understand the budgetary considerations. I know there are reasons \nthat push this back, but we need to put faces to these individuals and \nunderstand it. By the way, there are good personnel management policies \nand if there are these earlier retirements people are not staying \naround longer than they would otherwise so that they could get the \nbenefits they want to have and there could be a greater flow and help \nrecruiting; lots of good reasons that are independent of the change in \npolicy in activation and use of our Reserve Forces. It is something I \nhave a hard time understanding.\n  I have some other things in here. We can talk about stop-loss orders \nand how that has impacted the lives of so many of the military folks \nwho are extending their terms of duty. I think there are about 16,000 \nreservists who are under this new policy because of our needs as a \nnation, and those are perfectly reasonable. We are not arguing about \nwhether that was the right or wrong thing to do. It needed to be done. \nIt had to be done. It was an exigency that needed to be done, but we \nought to reflect that in our policies. We need to change policies when \ncircumstances have changed.\n  Finally, this is one of those things that the people who represent \nour military men and women in the Reserves\n\n[[Page S7206]]\n\nand Guard are absolutely almost 100 percent behind. The military \ncoalition, including the Reserve Officers Association, Veterans of \nForeign Wars, Air Force Sergeants Association, the Air Force \nAssociation, Retired Enlistment Association, Fleet Reserve, Naval \nReserve Association, National Guard Association, all of these people \nfeel strongly that this is one of their top priorities.\n  There are others. We can talk about health care, the demonstrations \nof it and a number of issues. But why are we staying with a 50-year-old \npolicy that is not even as reflective of retirement needs of people who \nare risking their lives to protect Americans as we are with our \ncivilian employees? I am not criticizing what our policy is for our \ncivilian employees in the Federal Government. We ought to reflect the \nfact that we are using these folks on a regular basis. The deployments \nare up. The numbers are up and they are serving at great risk for us.\n  I think this is one of those things we can do to actually change the \nlives of their families and reflect those sacrifices they are making \nfor us, and that is why I am asking for the support of the Senate with \nregard to changing the retirement age.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CORZINE. Yes.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, how much time does the Senator \nhave remaining?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 4 minutes.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I \nsay to the Senator that I think he is right on. In my State of Florida, \nwe have the same experience and the very same statistics that he has \npointed out with regard to New Jersey. This is not what was originally \ncontemplated for the Guard and the Reserves, and because of their \nspecialties, because there is not enough of the Active-Duty Force, they \nhave become, in effect, a full-time active-duty force.\n  The good news is they are professionally trained warriors, as much as \nthe Active-Duty force. The bad news is, this is not what they bargained \nfor in the Reserves and the National Guard, because they have their own \ncivilian lives. So I appreciate the Senator offering this amendment. I \nsupport it.\n  If the Senator is finished with his comments, I will take 30 seconds \nand point out one of the differences between the Senate bill and the \nHouse bill on something we tried to address in 2001, after the debacle \nwe had in the 2000 Presidential election in Florida, where there was an \ninconsistency of the application of State laws on to the counting of \nmilitary overseas ballots in the Presidential election.\n  One of the things we did was start a pilot study for Internet voting \nof overseas military. There was some concern that fraud could be \ninjected into Internet voting. So what we have done in the Senate bill \nis still have a process but have it delayed to the 2006 and 2008 \nelections. The House bill on Defense authorization has done exactly the \nopposite and instead has cut out any kind of pilot study on Internet \nvoting for overseas military.\n  I hope when we get to conference that we will insist on the Senate \nprovision.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator yields for a question. The \nSenator from New Jersey has the floor.\n  Mr. CORZINE. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 2 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I might just speak personally, I served \nin the Reserves some 12, 14 years and we knew what we had as our \nobligation when we signed up. That is the way it has been throughout \nour contemporary military history.\n  I share with the Senator how the Reserves and the Guard with their \nfamilies have borne the brunt of battle in the same way as the regular \nforces, but bear in mind that the regular forces, which are given an \noption for early retirement, have to put in a minimum of 20 full years \nof obligated service. If we continue to narrow the differences between \nthe pay and benefits for the Reserves and Guard and the Regulars, \npretty soon people will say, let's opt for the Reserve or the Guard \nrather than spend 20 years of our lives to gain those benefits that \nCongress accords our people.\n  For that reason, I intend to raise a budgetary point of order with \nrespect to Senator Corzine's amendment on that very point. The \namendment would allow eligible reservists to be able to collect \nretirement pay at age 55 instead of age 60. That would be an extremely \ncostly change to implement. CBO has estimated it would increase \nmandatory spending in 2005 by $1.7 billion. It would cost $8.2 billion \nin mandatory spending over the coming 5 years and $16 billion over the \ncoming decade. Those are very major costs.\n  I bring to the attention of my colleagues that already in this bill \nwe have added, by way of amendments, an additional $1 billion in direct \nspending, and discretionary spending is at $10 billion. So this bill \ngoes up and up and up, and it is going to the point where it might well \nbecome so top heavy we cannot persuade our colleagues to support it \nand/or the administration as they look at the overall budgetary aspects \nof our financial projections for defense.\n  Keep in mind there are additional costs that are incurred--I did not \nhear the Senator address these--regarding health care for retired \nreservists that would be caused by this amendment. The amendment would \nhave the effect of lowering to 55 the age at which a reservist retiree \nor his or her dependents would become eligible for medical coverage \nunder TRICARE.\n  The Department of Defense estimates that the added costs to the \ndefense health care program could be as high as $427 million in the \nfirst year should this matter be enacted, and $6.8 billion over the \ncoming 10 years. So both the retirement costs as well as the health \ncare costs have to be added in if the Senate wants to look at the total \nfinancial impact of the initiative by my friend from New Jersey.\n  The Senate considered this identical amendment less than a year ago. \nSenator Corzine once before introduced it during debate on the \nEmergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Iraq and Afghanistan in \nOctober of 2003. The amendment fell on a budgetary point of order \nfailing to achieve even 50 votes.\n  The Department of Defense has voiced strong objection to the \namendment, citing studies and experience showing that lowering the \nReserve retirement age to 55 would not help the services meet \nrecruiting, retention, or force management objectives. DOD advises \nthat, in fact, 80 percent of those who would benefit from this \namendment have already retired.\n  Let me be clear that my opposition to this amendment does not reflect \nany implied criticism of the patriotic service being rendered by the \nReserve and the Guard. Once again, however, we are seeing a proposal to \nchange a well-established condition of military service, one all of \nthose who go into the Reserves fully understand at the time they commit \nto service. Should this amendment be passed, we are incurring an \nenormous financial impact on this bill and the outyear budget of the \nDepartment of Defense.\n  In response to the claim that the greater reliance on the Reserve \ncomponent calls for increased rewards, please keep in mind the enhanced \nhealth care benefits included in this legislation already as a result \nof the work of Senator Graham of South Carolina. Consider also Senator \nHarry Reid's amendment on current receipt and Senator Landrieu's \npending amendment, should that be adopted, that would enhance the \nSurvivor Benefit Program. That is a broad range of benefits going to \nthe Reserve and Guard and others. These amendments equally benefit the \nGuard and Reserve retiree population, the same individuals who would \nbenefit from the pending amendment of the Senator from New Jersey.\n  As I say, we currently added over $10 billion in discretionary \nspending to this legislation on top of benefits we also increased in \nthe underlying bill itself in committee.\n  In response to the assertions that the role of the Guard and Reserve \nis changing and the enhanced retirement benefits are needed, let me \npoint out there is in the underlying bill a requirement for a \ncommission on the National Guard and Reserve that would have the \nresponsibility of examining the roles and missions of the Guard and \nReserve, and specifically to ``assess the adequacy and appropriateness \nof the compensation and benefits currently provided for the members of \nthe National\n\n[[Page S7207]]\n\nGuard and reserve components'' and ``to assess the effects of proposed \nchanges in compensation and benefits on military careers in both \nregular and reserve components.''\n  I anticipate that this commission will provide important insights to \nthe Congress in the continuing debate over these issues.\n  In summary, the Department of Defense simply cannot continue to \nabsorb mandatory spending directives that drive the cost of military \npersonnel, both Active and Reserve, to levels we simply cannot support \nat the same time we are trying to modernize, and also the operational \ncosts of the military today.\n  I urge you to reject this amendment on the point of order.\n  At this point in time, the pending amendment offered by Senator \nCorzine increases mandatory spending and, if adopted, would cause the \nunderlying bill to exceed the Armed Services Committee's section 302 \nallocation. Therefore, I raise a point of order against the amendment \npursuant to section 302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The point of order is not timely \nuntil all time has expired.\n  Mr. WARNER. I realize that. I thought all time had expired on the \nother side. I was about to yield back my time. Is that not correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey has 1 minute 51 \nseconds remaining.\n  Mr. CORZINE. I will yield back my time, but pursuant to section 904 \nof the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive the applicable \nsections of the act for purposes of the pending amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. WARNER. The pending amendment offered by the Senator increases \nmandatory spending if adopted and would cause the underlying bill to \nexceed section 302. Therefore, I once again raise the point of order \nagainst the amendment, pursuant to section 302(f) of the Congressional \nBudget Act.\n\n  I yield back my time and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The vote will occur at the appropriate time. \nThe Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The vote will then occur on the waiver?\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct. And the votes, again, for colleagues who \nmight not have followed the majority leader and Democratic whip's \ncomments, are to be stacked at approximately 11:30, at which time we \nwill proceed to all votes.\n  Will the Chair advise the Senate with regard to the next amendment in \norder and the time allocated to each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will now consider a McConnell \namendment and a Kennedy amendment, No. 3377, concurrently, for a total \nof 30 minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I did not hear. I was unable to hear the \nPresiding Officer. Will he repeat it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We now go to the McConnell and Kennedy \namendments, concurrently, with 30 minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3472\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will now report the McConnell \namendment which has not yet been reported.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia (Mr. Warner), for Mr. McConnell, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3472.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 247, between lines 13 and 14, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1022. REPORT ON THE STABILIZATION OF IRAQ.\n\n       Not later than 120 days after the date of the enactment of \n     this Act, the President shall submit to the congressional \n     defense committees an unclassified report (with classified \n     annex, if necessary) on the strategy of the United States and \n     coalition forces for stabilizing Iraq. The report shall \n     contain a detailed explanation of the strategy, together with \n     the following information:\n       (1) A description of the efforts of the President to work \n     with the United Nations to provide support for, and \n     assistance to, the transitional government in Iraq, and, in \n     particular, the efforts of the President to negotiate and \n     secure adoption by the United Nations Security Council of \n     Resolution 1546.\n       (2) A description of the efforts of the President to \n     continue to work with North Atlantic Treaty Organization \n     (NATO) member states and non-NATO member states to provide \n     support for and augment coalition forces, including efforts, \n     as determined by the United States combatant commander, in \n     consultation with coalition forces, to evaluate the--\n       (A) the current military forces of the NATO and non-NATO \n     member countries deployed to Iraq;\n       (B) the current police forces of NATO and non-NATO member \n     countries deployed to Iraq; and\n       (C) the current financial resources of NATO and non-NATO \n     member countries provided for the stabilization and \n     reconstruction of Iraq.\n       (3) As a result of the efforts described in paragraph (2)--\n       (A) a list of the NATO and non-NATO member countries that \n     have deployed and will have agreed to deploy military and \n     police forces; and\n       (B) with respect to each such country, the schedule and \n     level of such deployments.\n       (4) A description of the efforts of the United States and \n     coalition forces to develop the domestic security forces of \n     Iraq for the internal security and external defense of Iraq, \n     including a description of United States plans to recruit, \n     train, equip, and deploy domestic security forces of Iraq.\n       (5) As a result of the efforts described in paragraph (4)--\n       (A) the number of members of the security forces of Iraq \n     that have been recruited;\n       (B) the number of members of the security forces of Iraq \n     that have been trained; and\n       (C) the number of members of the security forces of Iraq \n     that have been deployed.\n       (6) A description of the efforts of the United States and \n     coalition forces to assist in the reconstruction of essential \n     infrastructure of Iraq, including the oil industry, \n     electricity generation, roads, schools, and hospitals.\n       (7) A description of the efforts of the United States, \n     coalition partners, and relevant international agencies to \n     assist in the development of political institutions and \n     prepare for democratic elections in Iraq.\n       (8) A description of the obstacles, including financial, \n     technical, logistic, personnel, political, and other \n     obstacles, faced by NATO in generating and deploying military \n     forces out of theater to locations such as Iraq.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as I understand the floor managers, we \nhave a half hour, and that time is divided between the Senator from \nKentucky and myself. We have two different amendments. At some time at \nthe leadership's discretion we will have an opportunity to vote on \nthose. The asking for the yeas and nays still is yet to be done, but it \nis certainly my intention to do so.\n  Mr. President, I yield myself now 5 minutes.\n  I want to address an issue that came up yesterday just prior to \nmaking the comments on my amendment because I do think it is of \nimportance, as we are reaching the final hours in the deliberation of \nthe Defense authorization bill, to make a comment on a particular \namendment. This is effectively the Leahy amendment which is supported \nby a number of the members of the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  I understand there is a reluctance on the other side of the aisle \namong Republican leadership--not necessarily the chairman of our Armed \nServices Committee but of the Republican leadership--voting on it.\n  I want to mention very briefly as we are coming into the final hours \nof the consideration of the legislation, the importance of the \nconsideration of that particular proposal. I am very concerned that our \nSenate Republican friends are effectively stonewalling the release of \nthe Justice Department memorandum on the torture of prisoners, and \nspecifically the majority leader has filed cloture on the Defense bill \nin hopes of preventing a vote on an amendment that would require the \nrelease of the Justice Department documents.\n  The administration released a handful of documents yesterday, but the \nmaterials are far from complete. This is not a partisan issue; it is a \nconstitutional issue.\n  It is required by our oath of office to preserve, protect, and defend \nthe Constitution of the United States. The administration has shown a \nstunning disregard for the law and the usual rights of oversight, \nresorting time and time again to saying that we are at war.\n  We are not under martial law in this country. The laws and the \nConstitution are not suspended because we are at war. The actions of \nthe administration\n\n[[Page S7208]]\n\nand questionable advice by the Justice Department contradict the \nfounding principles of this country. Our country is not above the law. \nThe President is not above the law. The Attorney General is not above \nthe law. The Justice Department is not above the law. The Bush \nadministration cannot continue to refuse to reveal memoranda because we \nare at war and because he does not want to. This is a precedent that \ncould dangerously undermine our system of laws and government as we \nknow them.\n  I believe the Senate itself is on trial. We have a constitutional and \nan oath of office responsibility to prevent this stonewalling of \nrequired accountability. If we look the other way and refuse to take \naction, then we are complicit in the gross violation and abuse of all \nthat makes this country great.\n  America's Constitution is not a document of convenience to be \nfollowed only when we feel like it. It represents our best ideals as a \ndemocracy and protects our freedoms. I hope the Senate will uphold the \nConstitution and demand accountability for the prison abuses that are \nso contrary to all we stand for as a nation. I will have more to say on \nthat later in the day.\n  The amendment which I offer on behalf of myself, the Senator from \nWest Virginia, Mr. Byrd, the Senator from Michigan, Mr. Levin, Mr. \nLeahy, and Mr. Feingold, is a very simple amendment. Effectively, we \nunderstand that the President now is going to the EU and then to NATO. \nDuring that period of time, he will be asking our international allies \nand friends to participate and help offload some of the very heavy \nburden that Americans are bearing in Iraq, the most notable being the \nloss of life which exceeds 95 percent of the lives that are lost, and \nover 96 percent in terms of the casualties and the extraordinary \nexpenditure of American taxpayers' funds, what I think will come out \nwell in excess of $4 billion a month.\n  We also ought to know the scheduling in some detail for the \ndevelopment of internal security--primarily police--and what is being \ndone inside the country and outside the country, and what is being done \nin terms of other countries around the world in helping, assisting, and \noffloading the burden on American service men and women who are caught \nin the bull's eye over in Iraq.\n  Many, including myself, find it is going to be extremely difficult to \nremove the concept of occupation as long as we are the only ones who \nare involved in the security issues in Iraq.\n  This amendment is the result of efforts by the President. We are \nasking for a list of countries that are committed to deploying military \nand police forces. With respect to each country and the level of such \ndeployment, we are asking for the scheduling of providing such \nassistance--that would be economic aid--and effectively when that \nassistance will come.\n  As a result of the President's efforts, we want to know the number of \npolice and military forces in Iraq that have been recruited for \npolicing and for the military--the numbers of members of the police and \nmilitary forces that have been trained. We want a description of the \nanticipated U.S. military force posture in the region during the next \nyear, including the estimate--I underline the word ``estimate''--of the \nnumbers of members of the Armed Forces that will be required to serve \nin Iraq during the next year. That is what we are asking for, \neffectively.\n  We are talking about planning, which the military does. Every year \nthey have to submit a 5-year plan in terms of troops for the military. \nThey have the Quadrennial Defense Review where they talk about the \nplanning in terms of the troops and the needs in terms of the troops.\n  What we are trying to find out is what is the best estimate. We are \nasking for the estimate, and we are asking for that estimate 30 days \nafter the bill becomes law. We hope this bill is going to come to a \nconclusion in the next 2 days. It then will go to conference. All of us \nare very hopeful and expect it will be concluded prior to the time of \nthe summer recess. Then the administration will have 30 more days in \norder to make this kind of estimate and report. We will certainly know, \nsince the President will return in the next several days, we will be \nable to make that kind of estimate.\n  Then we are asking: All right. Give us that information in 30 days, \nand level with the American people. Let the American people know. \nPeople ask: Why should we do this? It is because we have 140,000 \nAmerican reasons to do it. That represents the American troops over \nthere. That is the reason to do it. The American people are entitled to \nan estimate within 30 days, and then the follow-on and update of that \nin 6 months.\n  Americans who have members of their families serving over there are \nentitled to this information. The American people are entitled to this \ninformation.\n  There is ample precedents where we have required similar information \nin the Defense authorization--before going into the Balkans.\n  This is a matter of estimates. It is a matter of information. It is a \nmatter of giving the American people the best information we have.\n  We have heard all kinds of estimates over all periods of time. We \nheard estimates yesterday by Mr. Wolfowitz talking about the American \nforces may be in there for years.\n  The American people are entitled to know what exactly this \nadministration and this Defense Department, to the best of their \ninformation, can provide and should provide for the American people.\n  It is a simple amendment. It helps establish some benchmark for which \nwe can measure the kind of progress we are making in terms of help and \nassistance from other countries around the world--not only in terms of \ngetting support for troops and financial support but also help in \nassisting and getting information to the American people with regard to \nthe development of police forces and the training of those forces.\n  Those are essential elements in terms of Iraqi policy. The American \npeople are entitled to this.\n  I withhold the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the Kennedy amendment is little more \nthan an effort to undermine the President and further the myth that our \nefforts to bring stability and democracy to Iraq are somehow \nunilateralist.\n  It is past time for some Senators to stop pretending that we are \n``going it alone'' in Iraq. Neither the liberation of Iraq nor our \nefforts today could be characterized by anyone with a rudimentary \nunderstanding of mathematics as unilateral.\n  To begin with, the United States was merely a part of a coalition of \n19 countries that toppled Saddam Hussein and liberated Iraq. In \ncontrast, the United States joined only 16 other nations during World \nWar II.\n  Nineteen is more than one. It is more than a couple. It is more than \na few. It is a lot. Nineteen countries are more than most Americans \nwill visit during their lifetimes.\n  The liberation of Iraq was less unilateral than the French opposition \nto it.\n  Since liberation, the administration has worked to bring more nations \ninto Iraq to help stabilize and reconstruct that country. Currently, 34 \nnations are providing military and security forces to assist the Iraqis \nin defending their newly free country from the insurgents and \nterrorists.\n  The international commitment to Iraq has grown. Today the South \nKorean President announced that his country will push ahead with the \ndeployment of 3,000 soldiers, despite the savage beheading of a South \nKorean citizen in Iraq this very week.\n  Although the junior and senior Senators from Massachusetts have both \ndiminished the role that NATO countries are playing in Iraq, it is \nworth noting that 17 of these countries are members of NATO. NATO is \ninvolved in Iraq. It is also involved in Afghanistan. Both efforts are \nintegral to our global war against terrorism.\n\n  Currently, 6,000 NATO troops from 25 nations are participating in the \nInternational Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan. There are over \n8,000 foreign troops there, representing over half of the 15,000 non-\nAfghan forces in Afghanistan.\n  Now, the President's critics argue that NATO should be more involved, \nthat the international community should be more involved. We all wish \nwe had more help in Iraq. I wish we had\n\n[[Page S7209]]\n\nmore help in Afghanistan. I applaud the President's recent efforts to \nsecure passage of a new Security Council resolution that endorses the \nnew Iraqi government's democratic transition and to encourage NATO to \nprovide greater assistance. Predictably, Jacques Chirac opposed a NATO \ngreater role. Given that NATO operates on the basis of consensus, \nChirac's unilateral opposition will likely block NATO authorized \ndeployments.\n  There are two principle barriers to greater international \nparticipation. It is important to focus on this. First, a number of \ncountries, frankly, did not want democracy to take hold in Iraq. They \ndo not like the idea that Iraq may become a democracy. Some nations are \nthreatened by the march of freedom.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am going to ask the Senator to yield \nmomentarily to the managers for the purpose of a unanimous consent \nrequest, which is concurred in by the leadership, without charging the \ntime against the debate of this amendment.\n  Mr. President, on behalf of the leadership, I submit the following \nrequest: Currently, we are debating five votes with the understanding \nthat at the conclusion of those votes, and possibly yielding back some \ntime, a sequence of five votes will commence. I am now asking unanimous \nconsent that sequence of five votes be delayed until 1:45 and that at \nthe conclusion of the debate on the five scheduled votes, pursuant to \nregular order, we return to the first pending amendment at the desk, \nwhich is the Bond amendment, and proceed to debate that amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, we on this \nside express our appreciation to the two managers for this arrangement. \nIt will be most helpful to everyone, and it will help us see the end of \nthis bill. We will have other amendments after we finish the Bond \namendment.\n  No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Let me start by saying there are two principle \nbarriers to greater international participation. First, there are a lot \nof countries that did not want democracy to take hold in Iraq. They are \nnot democratic themselves, and they do not want any democracies in the \nneighborhood.\n  Second, some nations are threatened by the march of freedom. Others \nhad financial interests in the former Saddam Hussein regime. Some \nnations would not contribute troops unless we were to cede control in \nIraq to the U.N., a prospect most Americans recognize as a dangerous \nfantasy. At such a price, their assistance is not worth the tremendous \nrisk placing American security and Iraqi democracy in the hands of the \nU.N. entails.\n  Second, many countries that want to help simply lack the resources to \nhelp. As appreciative as we are of NATO's contributions, we are also \ncognizant of its limitations. European nations spend on average about 2 \npercent of their gross domestic production on defense. Of that money, a \nmajority is spent on personnel costs and benefits. Relatively little is \nspent to modernize or sustain the equipment, weapon systems, and \nlogistic capabilities of NATO militaries.\n  Many NATO countries cannot generate sufficient forces or sustain \ntheir deployment outside of the European theater. They lack the \nweapons, the aircraft, the logistics, transportation, and supply \ncapabilities the United States has. Because of these limitations, many \nnations have decided to contribute to Iraq's future by providing \neconomic, humanitarian, or other forms of assistance to the liberated \nIraqis. According to the Department of the Treasury, the 10 largest \ndonors to Iraq have offered nearly $8 billion in assistance. In \naddition, 29 donors have offered hundreds of millions more in financial \naid, and 16 more have offered in-kind assistance.\n  Even if significantly more international troops could be deployed to \nIraq, their deployment would not be a substitute for the long-term \nsecurity needs of that country. These needs can only be met by Iraqi \nsecurity forces.\n  There are clearly problems and challenges. The Iraqi security forces \nneed training, they need equipment, and we will be providing it. We \nwill be recruiting, training, and equipping Iraqis to defend Iraq from \nexternal attack and from internal subversion. These Iraqis, far more \nthan foreign troops, will determine the future of that country.\n  The long-term solution to Iraqi security does not lie with the U.S. \nmilitary. It does not lie with the U.N. or with NATO. It lies with the \nIraqi people. We must be committed to supporting them and their efforts \nto bring stability and security to their own country.\n  I commend the soldiers of the U.S. military and those 32 other \nnations currently serving in Iraq for their brave efforts to bring \npeace to a troubled land.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we are all grateful for the participation \nof other countries around the world in Iraq. But the facts remain, when \nall is said and done, the estimate by the Defense Department is that \n96.9 percent of the casualties are U.S. forces and 97 percent of \nnonhostile casualties are U.S. forces. We are grateful for the \nother countries, but the burden is on the U.S. forces.\n\n  I will mention what the difference is between the amendment of the \nSenator from Kentucky and my amendment, our amendment. There are only \ntwo basic differences. One is the number of reports. We have three \nreports. He has one report. And the timing of that report. The other \ndifference, the major difference, is we are asking for estimates of the \nnumber of American troops that are going to be there. The American \nfamilies are entitled to that information. The families who have \nservice men and women over there, whether they are in the Regular Army, \nReserves, or Guard, are entitled to an estimate. They ought to be able \nto get an estimate. It is amazing that the Senator from Kentucky will \nnot even include an estimate about the number of American troops that \nare going to be there. Not even an estimate.\n  Mr. Wolfowitz stated yesterday, when he testified in the House, in \nresponse to Mr. Skelton, that, No, we are not stuck. The U.S. strategy \nin Iraq is clearly to develop Iraqi forces.\n  The Senator from Kentucky and I agree, we are asking for progress and \nestimating the progress in developing the security force and the police \nforce. We agree with that. But he said the U.S. strategy in Iraq \nclearly is to develop an Iraq that can take over security from U.S. and \nallied troops. That is the policy.\n  What is wrong with asking the estimated time? What in the world is \nwrong with asking how long will it take, and get us a report 30 days \nafter this bill? If that will not be accurate, give it to us 6 months \nafter that. If that does not help, give us 6 months after that. Why in \nthe world is there a reluctance to level with the American people about \nthe amount of forces we are going to have over there?\n  The Senator from Kentucky includes reporting on the amounts of \nresources that will come from other countries. He includes in his \namendment the training of the personnel, the security personnel, the \npolice force. He gets a report on that. Why in the world do we prohibit \nthe families who are serving over there, and the American people, from \nhaving an estimate about the amount of troops going over there?\n  Now we had that. We did that before. This is not something that is \nenormously new. In the 1995 Defense authorization bill, Congress \nrequired a report that had to include 11 elements, including: estimates \nof the total number of forces required to carry out the operation, \nestimates on the expected duration of the operation, an estimate of the \ncost of the operation, and an assessment of how many Reserve units \nwould be necessary for the operation.\n  That was passed here. I do not know whether the Senator from Kentucky \nvoted against that. I do not hear him saying: We had that in 1995, and \nI voted ``no'' because we can't do that sort of thing here.\n  We have done that before in Bosnia. Is Iraq less important than \nBosnia? We were prepared to do that in Bosnia, and it got the virtual \nunanimous support of the Members of this body at that time. And we are \nnot prepared to do it in Iraq? I am confused. I do not understand.\n  What possibly is the justification for not leveling with the American \npeople on the best estimate this administration has on the number of \ntroops we\n\n[[Page S7210]]\n\nare going to have over there? We are not saying: Give us a number, and \nthen withdraw our troops; give us a number and then come back to \nCongress and tell us if you are going to need more troops. We are not \nasking that. Estimates, estimates, estimates.\n  We have the President who is going over to meet with NATO, with \nallies abroad. He is going to obviously, hopefully, ask others to \nparticipate because they clearly have an interest. They clearly have \nsome responsibility. They have not recognized it. I wish they would. \nBut clearly they have to understand they have an interest in the \nsecurity of that part of the world, and they ought to be participating.\n  We know the French were all too interested in finding out and \nparticipating in the oil issues, and it was obviously indicated to \nAmerican representatives at the U.N. that they did not think we were \ntransferring sovereignty unless we were going to transfer over to the \nIraqi ministers the ability to have independent European oil \nparticipation in the development of the oil resources over there.\n  We want them to be in there with regard to offloading the burden on \nAmerican troops and helping and assisting in terms of developing the \nsecurity and the police. We ought to know, and the American people \nought to know, whether they are willing to do that.\n  The President is headed over there. All we are asking for is \nestimates. It is amazing to me, given the past precedents, that we are \nunwilling to share that kind of information with the American people. I \nthink the American people are entitled to it.\n  That is what our amendment does. It is the principal difference with \nthe McConnell amendment. When you come right down to it, that is the \nprincipal reason we have an alternative out here, because the \nopposition refuses to share with the American people estimates, \nestimates, estimates on the number of troops. I think the American \npeople are entitled to it.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  If neither side uses time, time will be yielded from both sides \nequally.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has a minute and a half.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself the minute and a half.\n  I would mention, in his May 24 speech on Iraq, President Bush said:\n\n       [W]e'll maintain our troop level at the current 138,000 as \n     long as necessary.\n\n  On May 4, General Swartz, of J-3 Operations, said: ``the current \nplan'' and ``what we're working toward'' is to keep the current level \nof deployments ``through '05.''\n  General Abizaid, on May 19, before the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, said:\n\n       [T]he force levels will stay about what they are, I think, \n     until after the elections in Iraq.\n\n  Those elections are scheduled in Iraq for December or January.\n  We have had estimates by individuals. Why not share and give official \nestimates to the American people? That is the principal difference. I \nam still stunned by the unwillingness to share that kind of information \nwith the American people.\n  I reserve any time I have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I once again wish to emphasize to our \ncolleagues, in the past the Committee of the Armed Services most \nparticularly, and I think the Congress in general, has refrained from \nrequiring the Department of Defense to provide detailed planning, \nmanpower, or cost estimates for future military operations.\n  The very nature of any military operation is such that the planners \ndo their very best. They establish parameters. There are some great \nquotes, which I cannot bring to mind, but in war is the unexpected. You \nnever can know for certain what your requirements will be. Certainly in \ntrying to project that into the future, much less the immediate days or \nweeks or months ahead--force level projections and cost projections or \nestimates based on assumptions--conditions can change so quickly, for \nbetter or worse, rendering such estimates of very little value.\n  So the Senator has put forth an amendment. In the course of our \ndeliberations with the committee staff and this manager, and with the \nSenator and others, much of it is very useful and beneficial. There was \na lot of thought given. We wanted to accept the amendment with slight \nmodifications.\n  We have now, for example, at 3 o'clock this afternoon the Secretary \nof State coming up to brief the Senate. That is consistent with how the \nexecutive branch is trying to be very forthcoming, and the Department \nof Defense, the Department of State, and others, in providing \ninformation in briefings about the stabilization and reconstruction \nefforts in Iraq over the past year, providing numerous updates in a \nvariety of areas, at least on a weekly basis. General Abizaid has been \nvery clear about his force requirements for the next 6 months, reducing \nthe need for what we call a sort of quick-fix report as proposed by the \namendment by the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The McConnell amendment requires a comprehensive, balanced report \nwithin an appropriate and feasible time period that enables the \nCongress to perform its oversight responsibilities. Therefore, I think \nthis is a question of reasonableness, and that reasonableness is \npredicated on forthcoming estimates and forthcoming briefings by the \nadministration on a broad range of issues that relate to the operations \nour military forces are courageously performing worldwide.\n  Therefore, I strongly urge our colleagues to support the McConnell \namendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield the remaining time to the \nSenator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 30 seconds.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, in the fiscal year 1995 Defense \nAuthorization Act, we did precisely the same thing Senator Kennedy is \nasking. I am going to quote section 2(B)A. This is relative to Bosnia \nat that time.\n\n       The report must include an estimate--\n\n``an estimate''--\n\n     of the total number of forces required to carry out such an \n     operation, including forces required for rotation base.\n\n  There is good precedent for precisely what Senator Kennedy is doing \nin terms of requiring an estimate. The troops deserve it. The Nation \ndeserves that estimate.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 3 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I simply say to my colleague from \nMichigan, how well you, and having been privileged to serve these many \nyears together, recognize that the Balkan situation was one that had a \nmeasure of predictability that in no way parallels the complexity of \nthe mission we are carrying out in the Central Command AOR. There are \nstark differences between those military operations.\n  So, Mr. President, at this time I urge colleagues to vote for the \nMcConnell amendment, which we think is very reasonable. It could be \nviewed as a reinforcing of the Senator's desire to get the information \nwe share with him in many respects--important to the Senate.\n  I yield back the time and ask the Chair to move to the next \namendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Do the Senators wish to order the yeas and \nnays on both pending amendments?\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. By arrangement of the managers, there will be side-to-\nside votes. The McConnell amendment first, followed by the Kennedy \nunderlying.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays are now ordered on both \namendments.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3353\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n\n[[Page S7211]]\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I believe Senator Reed controls the time on his side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I yield myself 8 minutes.\n  My amendment would condition the acquisition of interceptors 21 \nthrough 30 for the ground-based midcourse national missile defense \nsystem on the implementation of operational evaluation and testing \nunder the auspices of the director of testing in the Pentagon.\n  I will try to give a brief explanation of where we are with this \nsystem that is to be deployed. It is a combination of existing elements \nand some brandnew technology. The existing elements, first, the defense \nsupport system, a satellite system, is a cold war system designed to \npick up the initial lift-off of missiles. That is in place. Then there \nis a group of Aegis ships that are out around the potential threat area \nof North Korea. That is a relatively new application of these ships. \nThey were designed to intercept and detect cruise missiles and \naircraft. Now we are attempting to expand that to track, at least \npartially, the flight path of an ICBM coming from a threat, \nspecifically North Korea. Then there is the Cobra Dane radar, an older \nradar system. It is not particularly well adapted at discriminating, so \nit is therefore not the best radar we could have. The administration \nhas canceled the X-band radar system, which is better. Then there are \nthe interceptors with the kill vehicles on top.\n  The subject of this amendment is the interceptors. For many years, \nthis ground-based system was designed to deploy 20 interceptors. Today, \nwe are taking five for this deployment. But 20 was a rather significant \nnumber for technology that has not yet been proven. What the \nadministration did this year is say, well, we want to go beyond that \n20; we want 40. We want to buy 10 more, 21 through 30, and have long \nlead-time acquisition funds for 31 through 40. Well, the Congress in \nits wisdom already terminated the long lead time for 21 through 40, but \nwe still have to budget this money for 21 through 30.\n  I don't propose to take that money away. I want to simply fence it, \nmake as a condition to spend that money that this system will begin \ntesting and evaluation. We had a vigorous debate about imposing this \noperational testing scheme. The result was now the Secretary of Defense \nis required to promulgate some criteria for operational testing and \nconduct these tests by October of 2005.\n  My amendment differs, and I think significantly so. It says we cannot \ndepend upon the Defense Secretary's criteria and evaluation--a self-\nevaluation by the Missile Defense Agency. We need to get this program \nback into the traditional system of operational testing and evaluation, \nwhich is conducted by an independent agency in the Pentagon which \ndesigns, supervises the tests, and makes sure the tests will do what we \nwant to do: deliver to the field a system that actually works. I don't \nthink it is unreasonable. In fact, I think it is entirely appropriate \nto say that before we buy these additional interceptors--10 more--we \nare at least in a situation where this rudimentary system has \nbeen entered into operational testing.\n\n  Let me specifically highlight the issue of the interceptors. The \noperation of the interceptor and kill vehicle is brand new. Neither has \nbeen tested in an interceptor test. We have not tried to fly them with \na kill vehicle even against a target. Yet we are buying 10 more of \nthem. It would be prudent to say let's wait and at least do a few tests \nwith these new interceptors and kill vehicles. The new version of the \nkill vehicle, by the way, where the warhead would actually impact the \nincoming enemy missile, has never even been flight tested. We don't \nknow what it will look like. In fact, problems with the kill vehicle \nhave delayed the scheduled flight test from March until July 31 of this \nyear; and, frankly, we are weeks away from that and it is entirely \nplausible that this would be delayed even further. So we are deploying \na system in which we have not yet even tested in flight one of the most \ncritical aspects of the system, let alone the fact that the rest of the \nsystem has been cobbled together by existing pieces of technology being \nused in new ways.\n  That is a strong argument, in my mind, to say how serious are we \nabout saying this is deployment. But it is more compelling, in my mind, \nto say at some point we have to get operational testing and \nevaluation--not some improvised form by the Secretary of Defense being \nimplemented by the Missile Defense Agency but a traditional system \nwhere the director of test and evaluation at the Pentagon does \nevaluation and testing. This amendment would do that. It would take no \nmoney away. It would simply say we cannot spend the money on the next \n10 interceptors--21 through 30--until we have entered the traditional \nmode of operational test and evaluation. This amendment makes a great \ndeal of sense. There are examples of how useful operational testing is.\n  The Patriot PAC-3 system--probably the closest analogy to this, even \nthough it is a theater missile system--is designed to go against \ntargets that are not as fast and don't leave the atmosphere. But it is \nthe same hit-to-kill technology. In fact, I was bemused years ago when \nthey would show the film clips of how successful we are in this new \ntechnology, and they would use PAC-3 film clips about the hit-to-kill \ntechnology.\n  The PAC-3 system was being tested developmentally. Then it went into \noperational testing and it failed four consecutive operational tests \nagainst a realistic target, one in which you try to simulate the \nconditions of battlefield use. Even though it was successful in the \ndevelopmental tests, it failed four consecutive operational tests.\n  Why are we buying missiles today that have the potential of \nduplicating the PAC-3 experience? Frankly, we could be in the \nunenviable position where the first time we try to fly this against a \npotentially real target, it fails. We have to have operational testing \nand the PAC-3 is a very good example. These operational tests are \nextremely useful in finally coming up with a system that is much more \nreliable.\n  So, as a result, I urge my amendment strongly. It doesn't take the \nmoney away. It simply lays out as a condition that we not spend it \nuntil we at least have operational testing. By the way, we are already \nbuying 20 missiles.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The Senator from Virginia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I must say I am fortunate to serve on the \nArmed Services Committee with Senator Reed and Senator Levin. \nThroughout the many years we have served together, we have had our \nhonest differences of opinion. I don't mind sharing them. I enjoy our \ndebates. It is constructive for the Senate. There is a process by which \nwe go about it.\n  At some point, there has to be finality reached with regard to \nissues. I say, most respectfully, to my good friend from Rhode Island, \nthe Senate has voted not once but twice, basically on the same issue \nraised by this amendment. I am reminded of Winston Churchill, one time \nin the depths of World War II, the early part of it in the Battle of \nBritain, when he went back to his old prep school and gave the famous \nspeech saying, ``Never, never, never give in.''\n  Well, at some point, the Senate has to get on with its business. I \nthink we have more than adequately debated the issues raised by this \namendment. Nevertheless, I will take the time of my colleagues to \ncarefully review it.\n  The Senate has already spoken on every single issue raised by this \namendment. First, the testing. The Senate adopted the Warner amendment \nto require ballistic missile defense testing in 2005. That is the first \nReed amendment. It rejected the testing approach which the Reed \namendment puts before the Senate once again, an approach, I remind my \ncolleagues, that the Pentagon's own chief testing official described as \npremature and not helpful to the program.\n\n  If the Reed amendment is adopted, it is just another prohibition in \nthe program, possibly a gap in the production line, and all of those \nthings end up in costly bills for the American taxpayers and \ndisruption. We all know what happens when you break down and develop a \nsystem whereby you cannot predict with certainty as to how and when the \nunits would be completed on production lines.\n\n[[Page S7212]]\n\n  It comes down again to, Do you want to deploy a missile defense \nsystem or don't you? If you do, I suggest most respectfully to \ncolleagues, let's accept the judgments that you have rendered and get \non and not come back and back again and again on these same issues.\n  The Senate already rejected the Boxer amendment which would have \nhalted the development. Do we want to halt production of missile \ninterceptors for an extended period of time, a path that would increase \ncosts, technical risks, and leave us vulnerable again to this threat \nwhere America stands defenseless to protect itself from an accidental \nor an intentional firing of a ballistic missile on to our territorial \n50 States? That is the issue.\n  The Senate yesterday, after very thorough and, I thought, one of the \nbetter debates on this bill, presented by my distinguished colleague, \nthe ranking member, Mr. Levin, rejected the Levin amendment which would \nhave done basically the same thing as the Reed amendment. It would have \nresulted in a disjointed, disrupted program.\n  I suggest the Senate should not now adopt an amendment that would \nfence 2005 funds for additional missile defense interceptors until a \ntesting requirement is completed, when it has already imposed a \nrealistic testing requirement in 2005, explicitly rejected the kind of \ntesting proposed in this amendment, and explicitly rejected the delays, \ncosts, and disruptions that would result from withholding the funding \nneeded to proceed with the testing and fielding of missile defense \ninterceptors.\n  I most respectfully urge my colleagues to sustain the decisions that \nhave been debated and voted on within the past few days by this \nChamber.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Reed \namendment.\n  The amendment before us covers ground that was considered and already \nrejected by the Senate in the three missile defense amendments offered \nby Senators Boxer, Reed, and Levin.\n  The amendment Senator Reed offers today uses the same approach to \ntesting proposed in his amendment that we considered last Thursday and \nthat the Senate rejected. But his amendment today has the additional \ndisadvantage of imposing a very significant cost--to the missile \ndefense program and to our ability to defend the Nation from long-range \nmissile attack. These costs are identical to those that the Senate \nrejected yesterday when we defeated the amendment proposed by Senator \nLevin.\n  Senatore Reed's amendment would prohibit expenditure of fiscal year \n2005 funds for ground-based interceptors until initial operational test \nand evaluation is completed.\n  I would remind my colleagues that the Senate has already voted in \nfavor of a Warner amendment to require realistic testing of the \nballistic missile defense system in 2005. Yet Senator Reed is \nproposing, again, an approach which would require operational test and \nevaluation of the BMD system and prohibit the use of fiscal year 2005 \nfunds to acquire additional missile defense interceptors until such \ntesting is completed. This is precisely the approach that the Senate \nhas already rejected and precisely the approach that even the \npentagon's own chief testing official believes is premature and \nunhelpful. The Senate has already spoken on the testing issue.\n  Furthermore, the amendment we are considering, if adopted, would do \nserious harm to the Nation's ability to defend itself from long-range \nmissile threats. Just as with the Levin amendment yesterday, the Reed \namendment would cause a break in production line for missile defense \ninterceptors and unacceptable delays in the effort to defend our Nation \nfrom known and serious long-range missile threats.\n  Planning and conducting operational testing and completing the \nevaluation of such testing would take at least a year. During that \nyear, no funding for the next 10 interceptors could be spent. Key \nmanufacturing personnel would be lost, subcontractors would be lost, \nand knowledge of manufacturing processes would be lost. When a \nproduction line is broken, it has to be restarted. Rehiring and \nretraining workers, requalifying subcontractors, and reestablishing \nmanufacturing processes would take additional time and a great deal of \nmoney. A production break would also increase technical risk to this \nprogram, since quality depends in significant measure on well-trained \nand experienced workers and well-qualified subcontractors and stable \nmanufacturing processes.\n  Loss of these funds for just a year could result in a delay in \nfielding these interceptors of nearly 3 years and a 4- to 5-year gap \nbetween fielding the 20th interceptor and 30th interceptor. Restarting \nthe production line would incur a cost to the taxpayer of more than \n$250 million. Some Senators may argue that fencing funds is not a cut, \nbut I would suggest that if the funds are lost for at least a year, \nthere is not much difference between this fence and a substantial \nbudget cut.\n  The threat more than justifies the need for additional GMD \ninterceptors. That threat is here today. It was confirmed last year by \nthe Director of Central Intelligence, in testimony before the Armed \nServices Committee, when he testified that the North Korea has a \nmissile that can reach the United States.\n  The need for additional interceptors is based on the threat and all \nthe evidence I have seen fully and clearly justifies the acquisition of \nthe 10 interceptors in the budget request. Any significant slowdown in \nthis effort would leave the ground-based midcourse defense element with \na severely reduced inventory of interceptors by 2007 and would leave \nour Nation vulnerable to North Korean and, potentially, Middle Eastern \nthreats. Unfortunately, Senator Reed's amendment, if adopted, will \ncause just such a serious slowdown.\n  Mr. President, the Senate has spoken already on all the issues raised \nin this amendment. I strongly urge my colleagues to be consistent and \nto oppose this amendment.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from Rhode Island \nwill yield 2 minutes to me.\n  Mr. REED. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first, I wish to ask the Senator from Rhode \nIsland a question. The Patriot PAC-3 experience he described where I \nbelieve there were four failures, did that not, in fact, lead to \nchanges in that system?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator from Rhode \nIsland is recognized to respond.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, it actually did lead to changes in the \noperational use of the system, and those changes were very valuable \nonce deployed in a combat situation.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the question again is whether this Defense \nDepartment is going to obey the law or do they believe they are above \nthe law. The law is very specific. It reads:\n\n       The Secretary of Defense shall provide that a major defense \n     acquisition program may not proceed beyond low-rate initial \n     production until initial operational test and evaluation of \n     the program is completed.\n\n  That is the law. This Defense Department too often has decided it is \nabove the law; it is beyond the law; it is not going to abide by the \nlaw. We have written a law for a purpose. Operational test and \nevaluation is required by law, not by the Secretary of Defense, but by \nthe independent office that was created to do this testing.\n  That is the definition of initial operational test and evaluation. No \nexception has been made for that. We deployed some UAVs, but we did not \nexempt them from independent test and evaluation. We deployed \nairplanes, but we have not exempted them from this requirement. This \nwould be the first system that would be allowed to proceed beyond low-\nrate initial production without that evaluation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask for 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Twenty minutes \nwas allocated and equally divided.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we grant 1 additional minute over and \nabove the time.\n\n[[Page S7213]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. One final point in this minute. According to the agency's \nown papers, disclosures, the production rate capacity of these \ninterceptors is one per month. That is the capacity. They are there. \nThis is full-rate production. They are not at low-rate initial \nproduction anymore. The capacity is one per month. That is what they \nare doing now. That is their plan. Their plan is for one per month. The \nlaw says they cannot go beyond low-rate initial production without this \nindependent evaluation.\n  That is what this amendment is about. It provides the money but says \nabide by the law, obey this law, there is a purpose for it--to make \nsure our weapons systems work.\n  I commend the Senator from Rhode Island for this amendment. It is \nquite different from any amendment that has been voted on before.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Who yields \ntime?\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority controls an additional 5 minutes \n20 seconds.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I request 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to 3 minutes being yielded \nfrom the majority? Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator \nfrom Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I have to agree with my colleague from \nVirginia, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee. We have had \nthis issue before us not only this year a number of times but last year \na number of times, and even the year before that to one degree or \nanother.\n  Whether it is intentional, the net effect of these types of \namendments is it delays the programs and it adds to extra costs.\n  We have had a lot of debate on all these issues that have been in \nthis particular amendment. I think it is time for the Senate to move \nforward.\n  I will point out in response to the question that was raised by my \ncolleague from Michigan that we had testimony in the full committee \nfrom the chief tester who says he believes we are in full compliance \nwith the law. I do not think anything else needs to be said. We have \nthat testimony. It is on the record in the committee.\n  I urge my colleagues again to join both Senator Warner and myself in \nopposing this particular amendment.\n  We do have some different testing procedures. That is because this is \na different program, unlike the many other programs we have had. So we \nhave to deal with it a different way.\n  The bottom line again is the chief tester is happy with the way it is \nprogressing. He has had access to the program that has been \nunprecedented. He is satisfied with the cooperation between the program \noffice and the test community. I have a letter, again, that I submitted \nfor the Record in the past that indicates he is fully satisfied. I will \nread specifically from the letter. It says:\n\n       My office has unprecedented access to GMD, and I am \n     satisfied with the cooperation between the program office and \n     the test community. I will continue to advise the Secretary \n     of Defense and the Director of MDA on the BMDS test program. \n     I will also provide my characterization of system \n     capabilities and my assessment of test program adequacy \n     handling as required by Congress.\n\n  In my view, it is time we move on. In effect, when we go for the \nformal testing that is being advocated in this particular amendment, we \nadd an extra year of delay. It breaks up the manufacturing lines.\n  We have had this discussion at a previous date. The net effect is \nsubcontractors have to be requalified, workers need to be retrained, \nand then the manufacturing process has to be relearned. It takes time, \nup to 2\\1/2\\ years, and money--some have estimated as much as adding \n$250 million to the cost.\n  So I ask my colleagues to join me and Senator Warner in opposing this \nReed amendment. It has the net effect of adding costs to the program, \ndelaying the program unnecessarily, and we do have adequate testing \nnow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Virginia controls the remainder of the time of 1 \nminute 45 seconds.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia has been recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. I will accommodate the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. I ask unanimous consent for 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. I respect the chairman and the chairman of the subcommittee \nwho have engaged in this debate. The question to me is: Will this \nsystem work? We really do not know if it will work. If we do not know \nit is going to work, why are we buying 10 additional interceptors at a \nprice of about $500 million?\n  So this is not the same amendment, the amendment written over and \nover again. This is an amendment about scarce resources--will we devote \nthem to these interceptors that are untested or will we devote them to \nother issues?\n  I point out that there is nothing in this amendment that slows up the \nprogram. There is nothing in this amendment that would take away funds. \nIt simply says, let us get into an operational testing mode before we \nbuy these additional systems.\n  Final point. This system has been plagued by delays, but they are \ntechnological delays. The reason we are not having a test--we did not \nhave one in March, and we are having it in July--is because this kill \nvehicle is not ready for such testing. There is nothing about our \namendment or about our procedures. This is a hard technology, but let \nus make sure it works.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the indulgence of the Presiding Officer. The time \nremaining on this side is?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time remaining is 1\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Fine. I believe our case has been made very clearly to \nour colleagues that these issues raised by the Senator from Rhode \nIsland have been passed upon by the Senate in the preceding 3 or 4 days \nafter very careful, conscientious, and deliberate debate. The issues \nare settled. We must come to resolution, no matter how strong our \ndifferences may be, and accept the judgment collectively rendered by \nthe Senate in these votes.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. REED. I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we will now proceed to the next amendment \nwhich Senator Levin will offer on behalf of a colleague, but I would \nlike to ask for a brief quorum call so I can consult with the majority \nleader because we are making considerable progress in beginning to \ndefine what remains to be done and a course by which this bill can be \ncompleted today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, all time on the \nprevious amendment has expired.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3423\n\n  Amendment No. 3423 is now pending, and under the previous order 20 \nminutes has been allocated, 10 minutes on each side.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we have on the floor now our distinguished \nand esteemed colleague, the former President pro tempore of the Senate, \nMr. Byrd of West Virginia. My first request would be a unanimous \nconsent to extend the time of this amendment from the current, as I \nunderstand it, 20 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. That we extend that to 40 minutes, equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S7214]]\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Thank you very much. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). Who yields time?\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, it is no secret that America's military forces are \nstretched thin across the globe. The relentless fighting in Iraq has \nexacted a heavy toll on the U.S. military, forcing thousands of \nAmerican troops to face extended tours in a dangerous war zone. Stop-\nloss orders have prevented thousands more from leaving the military \nwhen their obligations have been fulfilled. America's men and women in \nuniform have gone far beyond the call of duty to meet the increasing \ndemands that have been placed on them, and we owe them a great debt of \ngratitude.\n  In the face of such hardship facing America's military personnel, \nthis is hardly a propitious time to arbitrarily expand U.S. military \nobligations overseas, and yet that is exactly what the bill in front of \nus does. In an effort to help the Government of Colombia launch a new \noffensive in its civil war against guerrilla insurgents and the drug \ntrafficking that funds them, the Defense authorization bill \nsubstantially increases the number of U.S. military and civilian \npersonnel authorized to support the operations of Plan Colombia in \nColombia.\n  Plan Colombia is a 6-year antinarcotics initiative authorized by \nCongress in fiscal year 2000 to combat cocaine production and \ntrafficking in Colombia. From the outset, many Members of Congress \nworry that United States intervention in Colombia's drug wars--even \nnoncombat intervention--could serve to draw the United States into the \nthick of Colombia's longrunning civil war. In an effort to preserve \ncongressional oversight and prevent mission creep in Colombia, Congress \nplaced a cap on the number of U.S. personnel who could participate in \nPlan Colombia. Current law limits the number of U.S. personnel in \nColombia in support of Plan Colombia to 400 military troops and 400 \ncivilian contractors, for a total of 800.\n  This is a part of my statement. I believe it was in the year 2000 \nthat we placed a limitation. Originally, the 800 was divided into 500 \nmilitary and 300 contractors, making a total of 800. That limitation on \nthe number is current. This bill, however, would double the number of \nmilitary personnel authorized to participate in Plan Colombia, raising \nthe troop cap from 400 to 800.\n  That troop cap is being doubled. The cap on civilian contractors \nwould be increased by 50 percent, climbing from 400 to 600. This bill \nsays let us put in a little more. Let us lift the number.\n  The increases reflect the number of military and civilian personnel \nrequested by the administration to carry out a 2-year training and \nsupport operation in relation to an aggressive new counterinsurgency \noffensive being undertaken by the Government of Colombia called Plan \nPatriota. With the stroke of a pen, just like that--just a stroke of \nthe pen--this bill would increase the number of U.S. civilian and \nmilitary personnel authorized to be in Colombia to support Plan \nColombia from 800 to 1400.\n  So we are just inching along, just inching along. That may seem like \nan insignificant increase to some, but I expect it looms large in the \nminds of U.S. forces who have seen their tours in Iraq extended or who \nhave been prevented from leaving the military when their obligations \nhave been fulfilled. The 800 military personnel who could be sent to \nColombia under the proposal are 800 military personnel who would not be \neligible to relieve American troops in Iraq, Afghanistan, or elsewhere. \nBefore signing off on such a measure, the Senate should consider very \ncarefully the ultimate goals of Plan Colombia and the amount of \noversight Congress should maintain on the program.\n\n  I am offering an amendment. The amendment I am offering is an effort \nto address these considerations. My amendment provides a reasonable and \nsustainable level of support to continue Plan Colombia and to support \nPlan Patriota, but it limits the support to immediate needs, not \npresumed needs a year or two from now. Under my amendment, the cap on \nboth U.S. military and civilian personnel would increase from 400 to \n500 each, for a total limit of 1,000.\n  My amendment conforms with the House-passed version of the Defense \nauthorization bill. The House bill caps the number of military \npersonnel in Colombia at 500. The House bill does not address the \ncivilian caps, but the State Department has determined it needs fewer \nthan 100 additional contractors next year to support Plan Patriota.\n  Plan Colombia remains a volatile and dangerous mission. Three \nAmerican civilian contractors operating in support of Plan Colombia \nhave been held captive in the jungle by Colombian insurgents for more \nthan a year. Five other U.S. civilians were killed as a result of \naircraft crashes. Additional cocaine fumigation flights have been fired \non, and since August 2003, two planes have been downed by hostile fire.\n  This is not the time, colleagues, and Colombia is not the place for \nthe United States to ramp up its military commitment so sharply. \nAlthough the numbers may be relatively small, the mission in Colombia \nhas been constantly increasing.\n  That is the problem. The mission in Colombia has been constantly \nincreasing, evolving from a strictly antinarcotics campaign into an \noperation encompassing antiterrorism, pipeline protection, and an air-\nbridge denial program to intercept drug trafficking flights in \nColombia.\n  A major infusion of additional U.S. personnel into Colombia will \nplace more American personnel at risk and will increase the prospects \nof the United States being drawn ever deeper into Colombia's civil war.\n  The State Department has confirmed that it needs fewer than 100 \nadditional personnel next year to accomplish its goals. The Defense \nDepartment has estimated that it needs no more than 158 additional \npersonnel to support the second phase of Plan Patriota next year. \nDefense Department officials have also said they do not need a total of \n800 personnel and do not anticipate a time when 800 military personnel \nwould be in Colombia in support of the initiative. The Department is \nasking Congress to provide broad flexibility through an unnecessarily \nlarge troop commitment at a time when both human and financial military \nresources are severely limited.\n  I think Congress should take a more conservative approach to Plan \nColombia and particularly to the involvement of U.S. forces in Plan \nPatriota. I am willing to authorize a modest increase in the number of \nmilitary and civilian personnel for next year, but I believe Congress \nshould review the progress that has been made a year from now before \ndetermining what the final number should be.\n  If the Pentagon cannot tell Congress how many troops it will need in \nIraq a year from now, how can it say with such certainty how many \nforces it will need in Colombia 2 years from now?\n  The United States has spent the past 4 years training and equipping \nColombian troops and flying cocaine crop eradication missions for the \nGovernment of Colombia. According to the Congressional Research \nService, U.S. funding for Plan Colombia, since fiscal year 2000, totals \napproximately 3.7 billion bucks.\n  The administration has characterized the next 2 years as a ``window \nof opportunity'' to assist Colombia with its war against the \ninsurgents. Now, that may or it may not prove to be true, but the \nburden of securing that window has fallen on--guess who?--Uncle Sam. \nThat is where it lies, in the lap of Uncle Sam.\n  If the Government of Colombia is as committed to eradicating the drug \ncrops and defeating the guerillas as the administration contends, then \nthe Government of Colombia should take the lead in seizing this \nopportunity. Four years and $3.7 billion into Plan Colombia, the United \nStates should be on the verge of tapering down its commitment to \nColombia, not sharply increasing it. Where are we going here? When is \nthis going to come to an end?\n  Plan Colombia has ample flexibility built into it to allow the \nmilitary to surge, if needed, to respond to emergencies such as search \nand rescue or evacuation of operation.\n\n[[Page S7215]]\n\n  In addition, at the request of the administration, Congress has \nagreed to broaden routine exemptions to personnel-counting procedures, \ngiving the Defense and State Department even greater flexibility in \nmanaging the number of personnel in Colombia.\n  Routine exceptions now include such activities as port calls, DOD \ncivilian visits, certain military exercises, aircrew overnights as \nneeded for weather, maintenance, or crew rest overlapped during \ndeployment location, headquarter staff visits, and traditional \ncommander's activities, just to name a few.\n  Instead of the United States committing more troops and more civilian \ncontractors to Colombia than are actually needed, the Government of \nColombia should increase the resources it is committing to Plan \nPatriota to mitigate the burden on the United States.\n\n  My amendment increases U.S. support for Plan Colombia, but it does so \nat a prudent level that allows the Defense and State Departments to \ncommit the minimum number of additional U.S. personnel needed to assist \nthe Government of Colombia in prosecuting Plan Patriota while \nmaintaining necessary congressional oversight on Plan Colombia.\n  In recognition of the current sacrifices this Nation is demanding of \nits men and women in uniform, I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment and to resist unwarranted and excessive increases in a level \nof military and civilian personnel that may be deployed in Colombia.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, my understanding is the Senator from \nVirginia has, under his control or his designee, 20 minutes; is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. I will take a minute or two and ask unanimous consent \nthat the Senator from Alaska be recognized for such time as he may \nwish, followed by the Senator from Alabama, and then the distinguished \nSenator, Mr. Coleman, chairman of the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee \nof the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who will manage the \nremainder of the time.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. If the Senator will yield, I will yield to Senator \nColeman ahead of me.\n  Mr. WARNER. Very well. But I wish to speak for a few minutes.\n  I must oppose the Byrd amendment and urge my colleagues to do the \nsame.\n  The provision in the underlying bill to raise the troop cap in \nColombia from the current limitation of 400 military personnel and 400 \ncontractors to 800 military personnel and 600 contractor personnel was \nrecommended by GEN Hill, Commander, U.S. Southern Command, with the \nendorsement of the Department of Defense, Department of State and the \nNational Security Council. This provision was unanimously approved \nduring markup by the Committee with no dissenting discussion.\n  The United States has been assisting the government of Colombia--\nthrough Plan Colombia--for several years as Colombia continues its \nstruggle against narcoterrorists.\n  During the course of this assistance, we have asked the Colombians to \ndevelop a comprehensive strategic plan for taking back their country. \nThey have developed and begun implementing this plan, with our help.\n  During the course of this assistance, we have urged the Colombians to \nmodernize their armed forces and become more decisive in their pursuit \nof the drug-financed insurgents who have terrorized their country for \ndecades. The Colombian armed forces have gained confidence and stature \nand are forcefully and decisively carrying out increasingly \nsophisticated military operations with successful results.\n  Over the years, we have asked the Colombians to invest more of their \nown national treasure in defense, reduce drug cultivation, respect the \nhuman rights of their people. They have done so with very promising \nresults. The Colombian armed forces are now the second most respected \ninstitution in Colombia, behind the Catholic Church, according to \nrecent polling.\n  During the course of our assistance, we have asked the Colombians to \nbe forthright about their future plans, requirements, and needs for \nadditional assistance--they have been and that is why our regional \ncommander and the administration asked for a modest increase in the \ntroop cap, at the request of the Colombian government.\n  The regional commander has developed a prudent plan to provide \nadditional planning and training assistance that will enable the \nColombian armed forces to carry out the sophisticated, coordinated \nmilitary operations that will allow them to successfully defeat the \nterrorists and end decades of terror and violence in Colombia.\n  Troop strength will not automatically double in Colombia, it will ebb \nand flow depending on progress in Colombia's overall strategy and the \navailability of U.S. troops to provide assistance.\n  U.S. troops will not be involved in combat operations. They will \ncontinue to work from secure sites, help train additional Colombian \nmilitary units and help them plan and coordinate military operations.\n  We have a clear window of opportunity to help President Uribe and the \npeople of Colombia help themselves and end this conflict, but we need \nthis slight increase in assistance to help them realize this goal. \nColombia has made great progress, by all measures, and deserves our \nsupport.\n  The Byrd amendment would limit our ability to provide the assistance \nColombia has requested and our military commanders have recommended. A \nmodest increase in troops and assistance now does not foreshadow an \nendless commitment of troops, money and sacrifice--quite the opposite--\nit offers the opportunity to help Colombia end this conflict in the \nnear future. Defeating the narcoterrorists in Colombia, as quickly as \npossible, is clearly in the national security interests of our Nation.\n  The Byrd amendment will complicate the ability of our military \ncommanders and our diplomats to help Colombia end this terrorist \ninsurgency as soon as possible.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no on this amendment.\n  I assure my colleagues that the discussion by the Armed Services \nCommittee to raise these caps was one we did not take lightly. We \nconsidered it with very deliberate care. We feel we did so consistent \nwith General Hill, commander of the southern command, who came up and \nspecifically briefed the committee on the needs.\n  The bottom line is the nation Colombia has come a long way in the \npast few years to reestablish itself as a pillar of strength in that \nCentral American band of nations where there is such fragility in the \nstability of these governments. It stands out as the courage of a \ngovernment overcoming the insurgents in their countries, beginning to \nhave success. For a very modest increase in our military presence and \ncontractor presence, we can ensure the forward momentum of this \nsuccess.\n  It is an enormous force multiplier of benefit to the United States of \nAmerica. Were this nation to slip back into a situation which enabled \nmore and more exporting of drugs from that region, possibly through \nColombia, the consequence would be a weakening of that government, and \nthere would be multiple degrees of negative impact on our economy, much \nless crime and death associated with drugs. So for a small number of \nadditional military personnel which the military carefully crafted, the \nUnited States benefits greatly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I support the Armed Services Committee \nrecommendation. It was also the administration's position that this cap \non military personnel in Colombia be increased to 1,400. Senator Byrd's \namendment reduces that to 500.\n  There has been dramatic success in the war on drugs in Colombia. I \nhave spent a great deal of time trying to keep up with this. The \nPresident of Colombia, Mr. Uribe, deserves a great deal of credit. We \nshould support his continued efforts. His efforts have caused terrorist \norganizations to come to the peace table.\n  If we were to reduce our support now, they would have no reason to \nstay at the peace table. More U.S. personnel will only move the process \nforward.\n  I do not think we should go back to limiting our assistance to the \nGovernment of Colombia, as suggested by my good friend from West \nVirginia. I personally spent time with the commander of the U.S. \nSouthern Command, GEN James Hill, as did the\n\n[[Page S7216]]\n\nchairman of the Armed Services Committee. We were briefed, as were \nother members of the subcommittee, on the situation there. He has \nstrongly urged us to support the administration's request to raise this \ncap.\n  It is my hope, depending on the circumstances here in the Senate, \nthat a group of us can travel to Colombia this year and examine \nfirsthand what is going on down there.\n  This country could be a beacon now against terrorism in South \nAmerica. It is something we should support. We should not retreat from \nthe war on terrorism. The increase to 1,400 is necessary to support \nthis Colombian President, who has done so well, particularly against \nnarcoterrorism.\n  I urge the Senate to support the request as it is stated in the Armed \nServices Committee bill, which is also the request of the \nadministration. It certainly is the request of this Senator, who spent \na great deal of time considering the problems in Colombia.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the \namendment offered by the esteemed and greatly respected Senator from \nWest Virginia concerning military and civilian personnel strength in \nColombia.\n  I have been to Colombia, I have been to Bogota, and I have had a \nchance to personally visit with some of our troops that are doing \ntraining, and to visit with President Uribe on a number of occasions.\n  As chairman of the Foreign Relations Subcommittee on the Western \nHemisphere, I believe the situation in Colombia is of paramount \nimportance to the entire region. I must state very clearly this is not \na civil war in Colombia. Colombia is not engaged in a civil war. \nColombia, today, is engaged in a fight against narcoterrorists. That is \nwhat this is about. It is not about ideology anymore. It is about \nmoney. It is about drugs that are being used to fuel the insurgency. \nBut this is not a civil war. I think that is important to understand.\n  If you reflect a little bit on the history of what has happened in \nColombia, President Pastrana did everything in his power to try to \nnegotiate a settlement. He even set aside a parcel of land, known as a \n``despeje,'' as a token of good faith, but it was to no avail. You see, \nthe narcoterrorists had no interest in negotiating a political solution \nbecause, again, it is not a civil war. Their objectives were and remain \nto intimidate the public and to make money through criminal means.\n  Let me be perfectly clear, all three of the groups--the FARC, the \nELN, and the paramilitary AUC--are all terrorist organizations in the \neyes of the United States and must continue to be treated as such by \nthe Government of Colombia.\n  During my last visit to Colombia, I was speaking to the Ambassador \nfrom one of the Scandinavian countries who has been involved in trying \nto create some opportunities for peaceful negotiation. I said to him: \nHistorically, in the past, there may have been a civil war here. There \nmay have been those in some of these organizations who were carrying \nsome ideological belief and fervor that somehow they could change the \nsystem of government in Colombia. But today you have a democratically \nelected President with overwhelmingly high approval ratings, I think \naround 80 percent. Anybody in this body would like to have those kinds \nof approval ratings. You have a very active opposition party, a very \nactive democracy in Colombia.\n  Speaking to this Ambassador, he admitted: Yes, today it is about \ndrugs, and it is about money.\n  That is what we are dealing with today. That is the passion. That is \nthe common link of those who are engaged in a battle with the \ngovernment. The top fundraising enterprise of all three of these \norganizations is drug trafficking. They also are involved in extortion, \nkidnapping, and intimidation. There are few, if any, legitimate \npolitical objectives. They are narcoterrorists.\n  In fact, this Senate has voted to treat the guerrillas as such. \nExpanded authorities passed by this Congress allow the U.S. to support \nthe Colombians in their efforts against the insurgents, not just for \nthe purpose of fighting drug trafficking, but also for opposing the \nterrorist insurgent threat. All three of these groups appear on the \nState Department's list of terrorist organizations.\n  As I said before, President Uribe, who enjoys a great deal of \npopularity in Colombia, was elected with a clear mandate--that the \nnarcoterrorists can be dealt with only from a position of strength. \nThey must be weakened militarily to the point where they abandon their \nenterprise.\n  Under the leadership of President Uribe, the tide has begun to turn. \nKidnappings are down. Murders are down. The terrorists in many \ninstances are laying down their weapons. Coca eradication has reached \nrecord levels. But the task is not yet finished.\n  It is important. It is not a matter of: Well, we have put resources \ninto Colombia; when are we going to get it done? As we well know, in \nthis country the battle about drugs and narcotics is an ongoing battle. \nIt is something where what we have to do is maintain the pressure, \nmaintain the commitment, maintain the consistency, and not send a \nsignal that somehow we are putting a cap on it.\n  Again, the numbers we are talking about here are very minimal, \nwhether it is the Armed Services Committee recommendation of increasing \nthe military cap from 400 to 800 and the civilian cap from 400 to 600, \nwith a total increase of 600, versus the distinguished Senator from \nWest Virginia talking about 500. But the message is not minimal.\n  The understanding of this body of the importance of what we are doing \nin Colombia, and continuing to build upon success, is important. That \nis not minimal. What we do here will be heard in Colombia. It will be \nheard around the world. We have to do the right thing.\n  Under the Colombian Constitution, President Uribe is limited to one \nterm in office. What this means is during the final 20 months of \nPresident Uribe's term, there is a limited window of opportunity to \nseriously weaken these groups and to move beyond this conflict that has \ndevastated the Colombian people for decades.\n  That is why I believe the time is right to increase the cap, again \nslightly increase the cap, on the number of United States military and \ncivilian personnel in Colombia who are assisting the Colombians. We are \nnot talking about lifting the cap entirely. We are talking about \nincreasing the number of military personnel who can be in Colombia at \nany one time to 800 and civilians to 600. I applaud the chairman for \nincluding this necessary provision in the underlying bill.\n  This is not a blank check. Human rights protections are still very \nmuch in place. The United States Government works only with Colombian \nsecurity forces who have been thoroughly vetted. I am a strong believer \nin human rights, and in each and every one of my meetings with \nColombian officials I raise the human rights issue. I talk about the \nimportance that human rights has in this country and has for our \nsupport of what is going on in Colombia. Human rights protections must \nremain essential to our involvement in Colombia, and the Colombians \nunderstand that. President Uribe understands that.\n  Moreover, the activities of U.S. troops are limited. They are there \nto train the Colombians. Our troops will continue to operate from \nsecure sites only and will not be exposed to combat.\n  United States activities in Colombia and the region will continue to \ndeal with the nonmilitary facets of Colombia's crisis as well. We are \nsupporting programs for internally displaced people. We are encouraging \nalternative crops so farmers are not growing coca and they can make a \nliving for themselves and their families. We are supporting human \nrights and rule-of-law efforts across the board.\n\n  For anyone familiar with the situation in Colombia, it is clear \nPresident Uribe is bringing security, stability, and law and order to a \ncountry that so desperately needs it. Plan Colombia is a Colombian \nstrategy to retake the country from the grip of narcoterrorists. United \nStates support for Plan Colombia is predicated on a mutual \nunderstanding of what is at stake in Colombia, and a belief that the \nUnited States and Colombians can work together to address the crisis. \nWe have a critical window of opportunity here to make a major push \nagainst narcoterrorists in our own hemisphere\n\n[[Page S7217]]\n\nduring these final 20 months of President Uribe's term.\n  When President Uribe was elected and sworn in, there were mortar \nattacks on his life. I think there have been about 10 to 15 attempts on \nhis life. He is an extraordinarily brave individual. So often we look \naround the world and say: America will be there to support you, but you \nhave stand up for yourselves. Colombians are standing up. They are \nsaying they want to win this battle against narcoterrorism.\n  Ninety percent of the cocaine in this country comes from Colombia. We \nAmericans--our kids, our families--have a stake in the success of what \nhappens in Colombia. Again, this is the time. This is the place to send \na strong signal that we will strengthen our efforts against \nnarcoterrorism.\n  The risk is the risk of doing nothing, the risk of sending a signal \nthat somehow we are going to cap this and limit our effort, that \nsomehow this battle against narcoterrorism is a short-term, we-are-in-\nit-this-week and we-are-out-next-week approach. This is not about that. \nAgain, we are not talking about a civil war. We are talking about \nworking hand in hand with a government that is deeply committed, that \nhas put its own troops on the frontline, that personally has made the \ncommitment not just of fighting narcoterrorism but to economic reform, \npension reform, a commitment to human rights, to the rule of law.\n  The right thing to do is to support the Armed Services Committee \nrecommendation. The right thing to do is to reject the amendment of the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to express my opposition to \nSenator Byrd's amendment to Section 1052 which would cap the number of \nU.S. military personnel and civilian contractors operating in Colombia \nat 500 and 500, respectively. I support the current committee language \nthat increases the caps to 800 and 600, respectively, because it will \nenhance our efforts to help the Uribe administration stop the flow of \ndrugs from their country and into ours.\n  The situation in Colombia is at a critical point. We must ensure that \nit continues to move in the right direction. Colombia is a strong ally \nand major trading partner of the United States and is critical to the \nstability of the Western Hemisphere. It is also the home of three major \nterrorist organizations that derive about 70 percent of their funding \nfrom the production and distribution of cocaine, nearly half of which \nends up on our streets. Their violent activities are a result of the \nneed to maintain their narcotics trade, which has resulted in the \nsocial and economic instability of the country and the region.\n  President Uribe has shown a strong commitment to ending the drug \ntrade in Colombia by the end of his administration in 2006. I am \nextremely encouraged by his successes in drug eradication and his \nefforts to strengthen democracy and the rule of law. In 2003, coca \nproduction was down 21 percent and opium poppy was down 10 percent from \nthe previous year. So far this year, the number of hectares of coca \neradicated and the number of drug seizures are up from last year. We \nmust continue this success that is needed to maintain domestic and \ninternational support for the eradication program.\n  In Colombia, narcotics trafficking and terrorist acts have made it \none of the most dangerous places in the world. Last year, Vice \nPresident Francisco Santos-Calderon testified before the Senate Drug \nCaucus that more than 8,000 acts of terror were committed against the \nColombian people over the previous 5 years, including over 30,000 \nviolent deaths during each of those years. However, since the vice \npresident's testimony, there have been significant reductions in the \nnumbers of homicides, assassinations, kidnappings and other terrorist \nacts. I am encouraged by these numbers and know that these changes are \nvery encouraging to the people of Colombia.\n  Our counter-narcotics efforts in Colombia include military funding \nfor equipment, training and education programs for Colombian military \npersonnel. Raising the existing personnel caps will allow additional \nU.S. personnel to be made available to train Colombian personnel, and \nwill enhance their ability to conduct their counter-narcotics missions. \nWe have a window of opportunity here that we need to take advantage of. \nThe United States must be willing to help the Colombian government \nreach this goal. I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment \nand ensure an adequate number of U.S. personnel available in Colombia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if the Senator from West Virginia would yield me \n4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if he would yield me 2 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield the full 3\\1/2\\ minutes to my friend \nfrom Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Byrd.\n  The Byrd amendment allows for increases. That is the most important \nsingle point to make. There has been a suggestion that somehow or other \nif the Byrd amendment is adopted, that would reflect some kind of a \ndecrease in support for what we are doing in Colombia. The Byrd \namendment provides for an increase from the current level both on the \nmilitary side and on the civilian side. The current military level is \n400. The Byrd amendment allows for an increase to 500.\n  On the civilian side, the current level in law is 400. The Byrd \namendment provides for an increase to 500. So both on the military and \nthe civilian personnel, the cap is raised by the Byrd amendment--not as \nfar as the bill before us raises it. The committee raised it by more \nthan that. But the question is by how much will we raise the cap, not \nwhether we are going to raise the cap.\n  The Byrd amendment is a more modest increase. It is a more gradual \nincrease. It is appropriate in terms of the circumstances in the world \ntoday. We have our troops spread all over. There are great needs, \nincluding in Colombia. I happen to agree with my good friend from \nMinnesota that we have successes in Colombia. I have been there, too. I \nhave witnessed some of these successes. I support our efforts in \nColombia. But given the kind of commitments that we have around the \nworld, given the kind of demands on our troops around the world, it \nseems to me that a modest increase is called for at this time.\n  Again, we are not talking about reductions, we are talking about \nincreases. The House of Representatives did not allow for an increase \non the civilian side at all. They would retain the current cap of 400. \nThe Byrd amendment would allow for that to go up to 500.\n  An increase, yes; an endorsement of what is going on in terms of the \nefforts in Colombia, yes, because if we raise the cap, that does \nreflect an endorsement of those activities. But given the requirements \nfor our troops around the world, the demands upon us, this kind of a \nmodest increase is appropriate.\n  Finally, it is unlikely that they will be able to use this many \nadditional forces in any event. According to the State Department, the \ndates for increases in personnel are not just going to depend on our \napproval but also on program developments, personnel availability, and \ncircumstances that exist on the ground.\n  The Byrd amendment represents a very proper, cautious, modest \nincrease in flexibility for our Defense Department and State \nDepartment. It is appropriate that there be an increase but not as \nlarge as is currently in the bill.\n  I support the Byrd amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, how much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 5\\1/2\\ minutes on your side.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, the recommendation of the Armed Services \nCommittee is a proper, cautious, moderate increase. That is what we are \ntalking about. The numbers are not that great, but the message is \nsignificant. The message is significant. What we have is a \nrecommendation, developed by General Hill from SOUTHCOM, saying this is \nwhat we need to make sure we are living up to our commitment and to \nmodestly strengthen our commitment, that we have seen success. Let's \nreward success. Again, in a proper, cautious way.\n  I agree with my distinguished colleague from Michigan. That is the \nkind\n\n[[Page S7218]]\n\nof increase we need. But we are seeing success with murder down, \nkidnapping down. We are seeing great courage from President Uribe. We \nsee Colombians step to the plate. We have to maintain the pressure. We \nare not talking about civil war. We are talking about a battle against \nterrorist organizations. Winning this battle will have a direct impact \non the lives of Americans. It will have a direct impact on slowing the \nflow of cocaine and narcotics into this country.\n  On both sides of the aisle our colleagues are seeking the same \noutcome; that is, to have a proper, cautious, moderate increase in \nstrength. But it would be wrong to send a signal to reject the \nrecommendation, the thoughtful, reasoned, rational, proper, cautious \nrecommendation of the Armed Services Committee on this issue. Let us \nsend the right message and let us do the right thing by upholding the \njudgment of the Armed Services Committee, by not stepping back, not by \nplacing the caps that this amendment would place.\n  Let's reaffirm our commitment to Colombia, to the world, about \nfighting narcoterrorism and winning this battle.\n  I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia has 19 seconds.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, have the yeas and nays been ordered on this \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not.\n  Mr. BYRD. I ask for the yeas and nays on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time is yielded back.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3384, As Further Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the pending \namendment is Bond amendment No. 3384 on which there is no time limit.\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3384 and ask \nunanimous consent to incorporate the modifications that are at the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to modifying the amendment?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment, as further modified, is as follows:\n       At the end of subtitle D of title XXXI, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 3146. INCLUSION OF CERTAIN FORMER NUCLEAR WEAPONS \n                   PROGRAM WORKERS IN SPECIAL EXPOSURE COHORT \n                   UNDER THE ENERGY EMPLOYEES OCCUPATIONAL ILLNESS \n                   COMPENSATION PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Energy workers at the former Mallinkrodt facilities \n     (including the St. Louis downtown facility and the Weldon \n     Springs facility) were exposed to levels of radionuclides and \n     radioactive materials that were much greater than the current \n     maximum allowable Federal standards.\n       (2) The Mallinkrodt workers at the St. Louis site were \n     exposed to excessive levels of airborne uranium dust relative \n     to the standards in effect during the time, and many workers \n     were exposed to 200 times the preferred levels of exposure.\n       (3)(A) The chief safety officer for the Atomic Energy \n     Commission during the Mallinkrodt-St. Louis operations \n     described the facility as 1 of the 2 worst plants with \n     respect to worker exposures.\n       (B) Workers were excreting in excess of a milligram of \n     uranium per day causing kidney damage.\n       (C) A recent epidemiological study found excess levels of \n     nephritis and kidney cancer from inhalation of uranium dusts.\n       (4) The Department of Energy has admitted that those \n     Mallinkrodt workers were subjected to risks and had their \n     health endangered as a result of working with these highly \n     radioactive materials.\n       (5) The Department of Energy reported that workers at the \n     Weldon Springs feed materials plant handled plutonium and \n     recycled uranium, which are highly radioactive.\n       (6) The National Institute of Occupational Safety and \n     Health admits that--\n       (A) the operations at the St. Louis downtown site consisted \n     of intense periods of processing extremely high levels of \n     radionuclides; and\n       (B) the Institute has virtually no personal monitoring data \n     for Mallinkrodt workers prior to 1948.\n       (7) The National Institute of Occupational Safety and \n     Health has informed claimants and their survivors at those 3 \n     Mallinkrodt sites that if they are not interviewed as a part \n     of the dose reconstruction process, it--\n       (A) would hinder the ability of the Institute to conduct \n     dose reconstruction for the claimant; and\n       (B) may result in a dose reconstruction that incompletely \n     or inaccurately estimates the radiation dose to which the \n     energy employee named in the claim had been exposed.\n       (8) Energy workers at the Iowa Army Ammunition Plant (also \n     known as the Burlington Atomic Energy Commission Plant and \n     the Iowa Ordnance Plant) between 1947 and 1975 were exposed \n     to levels of radionuclides and radioactive material, \n     including enriched uranium, plutonium, tritium, and depleted \n     uranium, in addition to beryllium and photon radiation, that \n     are greater than the current maximum Federal standards for \n     exposure.\n       (9) According to the National Institute of Occupational \n     Safety and Health--\n       (A) between 1947 and 1975, no records, including bioassays \n     or air samples, have been located that indicate any \n     monitoring occurred of internal doses of radiation to which \n     workers described in paragraph (8) were exposed;\n       (B) between 1947 and 1955, no records, including dosimetry \n     badges, have been located to indicate that any monitoring \n     occurred of the external doses of radiation to which such \n     workers were exposed;\n       (C) between 1955 and 1962, records indicate that only 8 to \n     23 workers in a workforce of over 1,000 were monitored for \n     external radiation doses; and\n       (D) between 1970 and 1975, the high point of screening at \n     the Iowa Army Ammunition Plant, only 25 percent of the \n     workforce was screened for exposure to external radiation.\n       (10) The Department of Health and Human Services published \n     the first notice of proposed rulemaking concerning the \n     Special Exposure Cohort on June 25, 2002, and the final rule \n     published on May 26, 2004.\n       (11) Many of those former workers have died while waiting \n     for the proposed rule to be finalized, including some \n     claimants who were waiting for dose reconstruction to be \n     completed.\n       (12) Because of the aforementioned reasons, including the \n     serious lack of records and the death of many potential \n     claimants, it is not feasible to conduct valid dose \n     reconstructions for the Iowa Army Ammunition Plant facility \n     or the Mallinkrodt facilities.\n       (b) Inclusion of Certain Former Workers in Cohort.--Section \n     3621(14) of the Energy Employees Occupational Illness \n     Compensation Program Act of 2000 (title XXXVI of the Floyd D. \n     Spence National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n     2001 (as enacted into law by Public Law 106-398); 42 U.S.C. \n     7384l(14)) is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating subparagraph (C) as subparagraph (D); \n     and\n       (2) by inserting after subparagraph (B) the following new \n     subparagraph (C):\n       ``(C) Subject to the provisions of section 3612A and \n     section 3146(e) of the National Defense Authorization Act for \n     Fiscal Year 2005, the employee was so employed for a number \n     of work days aggregating at least 45 workdays at a facility \n     operated under contract to the Department of Energy by \n     Mallinkrodt Incorporated or its successors (including the St. \n     Louis downtown or `Destrehan' facility during any of calendar \n     years 1942 through 1958 and the Weldon Springs feed materials \n     plant facility during any of calendar years 1958 through \n     1966), or at a facility operated by the Department of Energy \n     or under contract by Mason & Hangar-Silas Mason Company at \n     the Iowa Army Ammunition Plant (also known as the Burlington \n     Atomic Energy Commission Plant and the Iowa Ordnance Plant) \n     during any of the calendar years 1947 through 1975, and \n     during the employment--\n       ``(i)(I) was monitored through the use of dosimetry badges \n     for exposure at the plant of the external parts of an \n     employee's body to radiation; or\n       ``(II) was monitored through the use of bioassays, in vivo \n     monitoring, or breath samples for exposure at the plant to \n     internal radiation; or\n       ``(ii) worked in a job that had exposures comparable to a \n     job that is monitored, or should have been monitored, under \n     standards of the Department of Energy in effect on the date \n     of enactment of this subparagraph through the use of \n     dosimetry badges for monitoring external radiation exposures, \n     or bioassays, in vivo monitoring, or breath samples for \n     internal radiation exposures, at a facility.''.\n       (c) Funding of Compensation and Benefits.--(1) Such Act is \n     further amended by inserting after section 3612 the following \n     new section:\n\n     ``SEC. 3612A.

Mr. President, we are not going to take much time, although \nI see my colleague from Iowa is here. This is a measure designed to \ncompensate the former energy workers at the Mallinkrodt site in the St. \nLouis, MO, area and the Iowa atomic energy workers at what was known as \nthe Burlington Atomic Energy Commission plant and the Iowa ordinance \nplant.\n  We have gone through many iterations trying to work it out to make \nsure that all sides are comfortable. I appreciate the courtesies of the \nNew York Senators who have issues. We look forward to working with them \non solving their issues. There has been a great deal of work put into \nthis. Some people may think it is small, when it is less than a couple \nhundred million dollars, but let me tell you, this is huge to the \nformer workers and their families who are directly affected.\n  I went back to Missouri last Friday, after we had talked about this \non the Senate floor. I met with some of the workers and some of their \nfamilies. The young woman who has been the leader in this effort, \nDenise Brock, was there. She told me how much this meant to her mother, \nwho lost her husband several years ago as a result of the cancers \nbrought on by excessive radiation. She also told me that when I spoke \nlast Thursday about Jim Mitalski, a former Mallinkrodt worker who had \ngone into the hospital and slipped into a coma--he lost a foot, had \nmultiple cancers--she said she made a recording of the floor remarks I \nmade, took it down and played it next to Mitalski's bedside where he \nseemed to be in a deep sleep. She said as she played it and we \nmentioned his name, she saw a smile come over his face, and she \nbelieved that he did know that we were going to do something. \nUnfortunately, Mr. Mitalksi has since died.\n  That is happening to workers in Iowa, in Missouri, and all across the \ncountry. Yes, they were on the forefront. They were the atomic \nwarriors, and they made what nobody knew at that time were great \nsacrifices of their health so we could win World War II.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I thank all of the people who \nworked on this issue.\n  I thank all parties for their assistance. I urge adoption of this \nafter the appropriate comments are made.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from Iowa is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN . Madam President, my colleague from Missouri, Senator \nBond, and I have been working very hard on this amendment to address \nthe very serious situation faced by former Department of Energy workers \nin Iowa and Missouri. I thank Senator Bond for his leadership on this \nissue, and for working very closely to address this very problematic \nsituation. We have also worked very closely with the chairman and the \nranking member in reaching an agreement enabling us to get this \namendment done. I thank both Senator Warner and Senator Levin and their \nrespective staffs for all of their help in reaching this agreement.\n  This amendment authorizes adding workers who were employed in nuclear \nweapons facilities in Missouri and Iowa who are suffering from serious \ncancers to the group of workers who are already eligible for automatic \ncompensation. The groups of workers eligible for automatic \ncompensation, a ``special exposure cohort, as it is called'', already \nexists for workers from Kentucky, Ohio, Alaska, and Tennessee.\n  But since this original legislation was passed in 2000, we have \nlearned a great deal more about the facilities in Iowa and Missouri \nthat makes it necessary to include the Iowa and Missouri workers in the \nspecial exposure cohort as well.\n  In Iowa, over the last 4 years, we have discovered there are \nvirtually no documents that exist that show what workers at the Iowa \nArmy Ammunition Plant were exposed to between 1947 and 1975. This makes \nit almost impossible to estimate radiation doses received by the \nworkers, a required step before they can be compensated.\n  Almost 4 years into this program, only 38 Iowans have received \ncompensation. Of the people who worked at these plants assembling \nnuclear weapons, working with very highly radioactive materials, some \nare still alive and are elderly, but they are ill and they are dying.\n  My friend from Missouri spoke about visiting some of his workers in \nMissouri. I, too, have had that experience over the last several \nyears--visiting my fellow Iowans who worked at the Iowa Army Ammunition \nPlant during those years after World War II, up until about 1975. They \nare ill and they are dying and far too many of them are suffering from \nvery painful cancers.\n\n  In fact, it is most poignant that this is happening right now because \nthe individual who first brought this to my attention several years \nago, Bob Anderson, is once again ill himself. In 1997, Bob wrote me a \nletter and said that he and some of the former workers at the Iowa Army \nAmmunition Plant had contracted cancers. Many were dying and he knew \nthey had been exposed to radiation, and he asked was there anything I \ncould do about it because they were not getting any medical help \nwhatsoever.\n  I, then, wrote a letter to the Department of the Army to inquire \nabout this. I received a reply from the Department of the Army that \nsaid basically there were no nuclear weapons ever assembled there. \nWell, we just took the answer from the Army and sent it back out to Bob \nAnderson. This upset him greatly. He came back into my office in Iowa \nand said: Wait a minute. They are wrong; we assembled nuclear weapons \nthere for almost 30 years.\n  So we started looking at it further, and we found that the Department \nof the Army was wrong. We had gotten misinformation from the Department \nof the Army. We finally dug back through the DOE and the old Atomic \nEnergy files and found out that, in fact, they had assembled nuclear \nweapons at IAAP for close to 30 years. This was all very confusing. We \nfinally got it straightened out. These workers were exposed to \nradiation, they weren't told what they were being exposed to and they \nwere told at the time this was top secret that they could not discuss \nit with anyone, that they could receive prison terms if they were to \ntalk about this with anyone.\n  Many of these people became sick and many died without ever having \nbreathed a word that they had worked assembling nuclear weapons because \nthey were loyal, patriotic citizens. They had taken an oath and were \nsworn to secrecy that they would not talk about it. Even today some \nstill will not speak about the work they did.\n  Well, for those who are left, we finally got it cleared that they \ncould\n\n[[Page S7220]]\n\ntalk about it openly with their doctors, their health care \npractitioners. But Bob Anderson is the one person singularly \nresponsible for highlighting and bringing to the public attention what \nhappened at the Iowa Army Ammunition Plant, the person who started the \nball rolling, so to speak, to get us to understand that there were all \nthese workers who had been exposed but who are unaccounted for.\n  Bob Anderson is the one who was responsible for us and for the \nDepartment of Energy now looking at the Department of the Army trying \nto find the records, and now understanding that there are no \nrecords. There are no dosage records for these people.\n\n  Several years ago, when he first contacted my office about this, he \nhad been diagnosed with lymphoma. He has struggled with it ever since. \nAs we speak today, Bob Anderson is in a hospital. He had his thyroid \ntaken out. I spoke with his wife the other day on the phone while he \nwas undergoing surgery. Later on, after he had gotten out, the doctor \ntold her that his cancerous thyroid was the largest swollen thyroid he \nhad ever seen in his life.\n  We are now waiting for the biopsies. We are hoping it has not spread. \nBut as we stand here today, Bob Anderson lies in a hospital bed waiting \nto find out if he now has a second kind of cancer, thyroid cancer, on \ntop of his lymphoma. Bob Anderson who side by side with other IAAP \nworkers spent many years assembling nuclear weapons, who had been \nexposed to radiation, who had not been told what he was exposed to, and \nwho did not wear dosage badges. All Bob Anderson is asking for is fair \ntreatment, and that is what we are accomplishing today. That is what \nthe managers of the bill have agreed to.\n  So I would like to extend a big thank you to Senator Warner and \nSenator Levin and their staffs for helping us get this through. These \nare people who are suffering, they are dying. They need help, and they \nhave no place to turn other than us in the U.S. Congress.\n  As I said, some people were put into that cohort in 2000. We \nrecognized then that there would be people out there for whom there \nwere no records, and for whom fairness would require that they should \nbe put into that special cohort. That is what this amendment does. This \namendment is an important step in that direction: to get these people \nput into that special cohort to provide them automatic compensation.\n  Again, I thank my colleague from Missouri for his leadership and help \non this issue. I also again thank Senator Warner and Senator Levin and \ntheir respective staffs for helping us work this out. I thank Bob \nAnderson for his courageous stand, for over the last several years \nnever giving up, for his advocacy, not just on his own behalf but for \nthousands of his fellow workers in Iowa and, I daresay, in Missouri and \nother places. Even as he lies in the hospital, I want him to know we \nare doing everything we can to right this wrong and to get compensation \nto those former nuclear weapons workers.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 3384, as further \nmodified. Is there further debate? The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. TALENT. Madam President, I appreciate the chance to offer a word \nor two on the amendment. My friend from Missouri and my friend from \nIowa have covered the ground very well. In part, I rise to compliment \nthem on their dogged tenacity on behalf of these workers who deserve \nthis compensation and now have a chance of receiving it because of \ntheir hard work.\n  I also compliment the managers of the bill who, even though in their \nStates they do not have people directly involved in this, have seen the \nplight of our Missouri workers and Iowa workers and have worked with us \nto get this amendment adopted.\n  It simply means workers in Iowa and Missouri are going to have the \nsame opportunity to get this compensation under expedited rules and \nprocedures that already exist in other States so they will actually \nhave some recourse and some compensation for the illnesses they have \nsuffered because of this overexposure, and they will get it before they \npass away because of the cancers that have resulted.\n  There have been many tragic instances where people have fought for \nthis compensation, have waited for what the law says they are entitled \nto, and have never gotten it. This amendment holds out hope now that we \nwill be able to do justice in these cases.\n  I compliment my friend from Iowa and my colleague from Missouri for \ntheir very hard work, and I join them in offering and supporting the \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I commend the Senators who have been \ninvolved in again bringing this issue to the forefront, fighting the \nhard fight that was necessary for this to be accomplished.\n  As far as I know, there are no other Senators at this point who wish \nto talk about this modified amendment. As far as we are concerned, it \ncan be adopted.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I would like to acknowledge Senator \nWarner and Senator Levin for their efforts on this legislation, which \nis vital to the men and women of our military and our national \nsecurity. At this time, I, along with my colleague Senator Clinton, \nwould like to engage Senators Warner and Levin in a colloquy regarding \nthe needs of employees who worked in Department of Energy, DOE, and \nDOE-contractor facilities on atomic weapons-related production in New \nYork and throughout the United States.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I also wish to recognize the efforts of my friends from \nVirginia and Michigan on this bill and their willingness to engage in \nthis colloquy in order to discuss the needs of New York's former \nnuclear workers and the necessity of providing them with prompt access \nto the compensation they have earned through service to this country.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senators from New York for their remarks, and \nwould be happy to engage them in a colloquy.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am also happy to engage in this colloquy with the \nSenators form New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my esteemed colleagues, Mr. Warner and Mr. \nLevin, for recognizing the common plight among sick workers throughout \nour great Nation. In my home State of New York, thousands of nuclear \nworkers labored for decades during the cold war in hazardous conditions \nat DOE and contractor facilities unaware of the health risks. These \nworkers helped to create the huge nuclear arsenal that served as a \ndeterrent to the Soviet Union during the cold war, but many paid a high \nprice in terms of their health. It is now our obligation to assist them \nin all possible ways, so that their sacrifices do not go unrecognized.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I wholeheartedly agree with the senior Senator from New \nYork. Our State's contribution to America's security throughout the \ncold war was large and important. New York is home to 36 former atomic \nweapons employer sites and DOE facilities--more than any other State in \nthe Nation. Fourteen of these facilities are located in the western New \nYork region alone.\n  Under the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Act of \n2000, Congress made a promise to the people who worked at these sites \nand others like them across the country that they would receive \nuniform, timely compensation under the act under certain conditions. \nBut to date, NIOSH has completed just one of the many needed site \nprofiles in New York that are needed to administer the program.\n  One of the provisions of that act provides for what is known as a \nspecial exposure cohort. The act named facilities in four States that \nwould be added to the special cohort, which in essence results in \nprompt payment of benefits under the act without the need to go through \na dose reconstruction process.\n  The Bond-Harkin amendment would, under certain conditions, add \nseveral facilities in Missouri and Iowa to this special exposure \ncohort. I am very sympathetic to the plight of these\n\n[[Page S7221]]\n\nworkers, but I am even more concerned about the workers that I \nrepresent. Many of the New York workers are in very similar plights as \nthe workers in Missouri and Iowa who might be helped by the Bond-Harkin \namendment.\n  I am encouraged that the amendment recognizes this fact, in that it \nincludes a sense of the Senate declaring that all eligible employees \ndeserve fair and equitable consideration under the act's special \nexposure cohort provisions.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I agree, and hope that when the Bond-Harkin amendment is \ndiscussed in conference, the Senators from Virginia and Michigan will \ntake into consideration the workers in New York and throughout the \ncountry who share a similar set of circumstances to those workers in \nIowa and Missouri. In particular, I would ask that they look at how the \nspecial exposure cohort issue can be addressed in the most equitable \nway possible, and contemplate options that would provide for equitable \naccess to the special exposure cohort for New York's workers.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I echo the request of my colleague from New York. I \nwould also ask whether the Senators from Virginia and Michigan share \nour understanding that the Bond-Harkin amendment to the National \nDefense Authorization Act of 2004 does not in any way reflect the view \nthat New York's workers or those of any other State are less deserving \nof access to special cohorts than those named in the amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my esteemed colleagues from New \nYork for their dedication to this cause. We indeed recognize the \nsacrifice workers made throughout our country in the nuclear arms \nbuildup of the cold war and will endeavor to take into account the \nsimilar situations that exist for nuclear workers throughout our great \nNation. I agree with their assessments of the Bond-Harkin amendment and \nassure the Senators from New York that I will take their concerns into \nconsideration when conferencing the House and Senate bills.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I join my friend from Virginia in recognizing the \ncommitment of the Senators from New York to finding a solution to this \ncritical problem. I share their understanding regarding the scope and \nintent of the Bond-Harkin amendment, and will do our best to address \ntheir concerns when conferencing the House and Senate bills.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n3384, as further modified.\n  The amendment (No. 3384), as further modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ncalling of the quorum be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 2507\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 580, S. 2507; \nthat the Cochran amendment at the desk be agreed to, the bill, as \namended, be read the third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and any statements be printed in the Record.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I have \nspoken with the distinguished junior Senator from Michigan, Ms. \nStabenow. She has some problems with the way this piece of legislation \nis written. She thinks there should be more attention focused on fruits \nand vegetables. She would like to have further discussion with the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Mississippi.\n  As a result of that, I hope something can be worked out on this. I \nreluctantly note my objection on behalf of my friend from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, I rise to speak about the Oil-for-Food \nscandal. I do so because I have been told that high ranking officials \nat the State Department and Paul Volcker, who is heading up the U.N. \ninvestigation, believe Senators are not personally committed to gaining \naccess to all relevant documents, including U.N. audits. That is not \ntrue.\n  A bipartisan group of Senators, including ranking members from the \nArmed Services and Foreign Relations Committees, wrote to Mr. Bremer in \nIraq asking him to secure the Oil-for-Food documents.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 9, 2004.\n     Hon. L. Paul Bremer, III,\n     Administrator, Coalition Provisional Authority, Baghdad, \n         Iraq.\n       Dear Mr. Bremer: We are writing to inquire about the status \n     of documents relating to the United Nations ``Oil-for-Food'' \n     Program (OFF Program), and express our concerns about recent \n     developments that could jeopardize American interests with \n     respect to those documents.\n       The Section 2007 report submitted to Congress in April \n     states that you have ordered ``all relevant records in Iraq \n     ministries be inventoried and protected so that they can be \n     made available'' for certain investigations into the OFF \n     Program. We also understand that the Coalition Provisional \n     Authority (CPA) has recently entered into a Memorandum of \n     Understanding with the Independent Inquiry Committee (IIC) \n     regarding the sharing of documents and information relating \n     to the OFF Program.\n       Our concern is that all documents related to the OFF \n     Program be secured not only for the IIC and the Iraqi Board \n     of Supreme Audit (BSA), but also for investigations conducted \n     by Congressional committees. Accordingly, we request that the \n     CPA work with the Inspector General's Office of the \n     Department of Defense (DoD IG) to secure a copy of all \n     documents that are being gathered for the BSA and the IIC \n     investigations. Once such documents are secured, a complete \n     set of documents relevant to the OFF Program should be \n     delivered within sixty (60) days or no later than August 31, \n     2004, to the General Accounting Office for further delivery, \n     upon request, to any Congressional committee of competent \n     jurisdiction. Please identify by no later than June 11, 2004, \n     a person at the CPA and at DoD IG responsible for securing \n     the documents in response to this request.\n       We are sure you will agree that these documents should be \n     secured for all investigations into the OFF Program, whether \n     in Iraq or the United States. In light of the recent \n     dissolution of the Iraqi Governing Council, the formation of \n     a new Iraqi government ahead of schedule, and the rapidly-\n     approaching June 30th turnover date, we are concerned that \n     American access to such documents will be jeopardized. \n     Accordingly, we believe that the documents should be secured, \n     duplicated, and delivered to DoD IG prior to June 30, 2004.\n           Sincerely,\n     Norm Coleman,\n     Carl Levin,\n     Saxby Chambliss,\n     Joseph R. Biden, Jr.,\n     Lindsey Graham,\n     John Ensign.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Congressional investigators have an interest in making \nsure those documents are available and accessible. A subpoena has been \nserved on BNP by the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. Chairman \nColeman and the ranking Democrat, Senator Levin, have also sent letters \nseeking Oil-for-Food documents to\n\n[[Page S7222]]\n\nthe State Department and the General Accounting Office.\n  An amendment to the Defense bill, which would help Congress to \nconduct its own inquiries into the Oil-for-Food Program was passed \nunanimously. We want access to those documents. We wish the Volcker \npanel well; however, we are not going to abandon the duty of this \nCongress to conduct proper oversight or subcontract that role to an \ninternational body. The stakes are much too high.\n  We now believe that Saddam Hussein, corrupt U.N. officials, and \ncorrupt well-connected countries were the real benefactors for the Oil-\nfor-Food Program. They profited from illegal oil shipments, financial \ntransactions, kickbacks, and surcharges, and allowed Saddam Hussein to \nbuild up his armed forces and live in the lap of luxury.\n  The evidence in this far-reaching scandal tells an unbelievable \nstory. Our own U.S. General Accounting Office estimates that Saddam \nHussein siphoned off $4.4 billion through oil sale surcharges. Saddam \nHussein also demanded kickbacks on the humanitarian relief side from \nsuppliers which amounted to 10 to 20 percent on many contracts. Saddam \nused this revenue to rebuild Iraq's military capabilities, to maintain \nlavish palaces, buy loyalty, oppress his people, and perhaps \nfinancially support terrorism.\n  And as Claude Haknes-Drielsma, an IGC consultant investigating the \nscandal, testified, the secret payments . . . ``provided Saddam Hussein \nand his corrupt regime with a convenient vehicle through which he \nbought support, internationally by bribing political parties, \ncompanies, and journalists . . . This secured the cooperation and \nsupport of countries that included members of the Security Council of \nthe United Nations.''\n  The United Nations should be embarrassed. What resulted from the \ngoodwill gesture was international scandal, corruption at the highest \nlevels, and suffering Iraqi citizens--not exactly a model U.N. program.\n  Tasked by the international community to deny Saddam Hussein the \nability to rebuild his military apparatus while providing humanitarian \nneeds, the United Nations allowed the corrupt to become richer and \ninnocent Iraqis to be oppressed. Today we have a chance to rectify that \ninjustice. We must demand that the United Nations cooperate completely \nwith efforts to extrapolate the truth from this scandal and punish the \nguilty.\n  Unfortunately, that does not appear to be happening, as William \nSafire notes in a recent column entitled ``Tear Down This UN \nStonewall.'' He talks about how Paul Volcker's first choices for \nstaffing the U.N.'s own Oil-for-Food--\n\n       . . . were turned off not just by the lack of subpoena or \n     oath-requiring power . . . but by an inadequate budget to dig \n     into the largest financial rip-off in history. As a result, \n     after nearly three months, a foot-dragging bureaucracy has \n     successfully frustrated the independent committee dependent \n     on it.\n\n  We know that officials acting on behalf of Benon Sevan, the executive \ndirector of the Oil-for-Food Program for the United Nations, who is \npersonally implicated in the scandal, are asking contractors not to \nrelease documents relating to the program to congressional \ninvestigators without first getting U.N. authorization. We know the \nU.S. has asked for copies of the U.N. internal audit reports on this \nprogram, and the U.N. denied our request. I will include an exchange of \nletters to that effect in the Record.\n  It was reported recently that the head of the U.N.'s own inspector \ngeneral's office himself is now being investigated by the United \nNations. The U.N. should be more interested in bringing the truth to \nlight than trying to protect its tattered reputation and its corrupt \nofficials. I hope the Volcker panel gets the tools it needs from the \nU.N. to do a thorough investigation of the Oil-for-Food Program. The \nVolcker panel work does not obviate the need for the U.S. Congress to \nconduct its own investigation.\n  My amendment ensures that the Oil-for-Food documents in Iraq are \nsecured before the June 30 handover and that copies are brought to the \nUnited States. Right now it is unclear what will happen to those \ndocuments following the June 30 handover. The amendment also requires \nU.S. agencies to provide relevant congressional committees access to \nOil-for-Food documents. Additionally, it calls on the U.S. to use its \nvoice and vote to get access to U.N. Oil-for-Food audits and core \ndocuments.\n  Lastly, it mandates a GAO review of the Oil-for-Food Program. Under \nthe Helms-Biden U.N. reform legislation which was signed into law, as \nthis amendment makes clear, we believe the GAO should have access to \nU.S. documents relating to the Oil-for-Food Program.\n  We in the Congress have a choice to make. We could do nothing and \nallow the word ``humanitarianism'' to be the new code word for \ncorruption and scandal from here on out, or we can stand up and make \nthe United Nations rightfully accountable for the corruption that has \nharmed innocent Iraqis.\n  The answer is clear: We must act.\n  The U.N. is broken. If the Security Council is to function, there \ncannot be questions as to whether members are more interested in lining \ntheir pockets than preserving security. We have to make sure Iraqi \ngovernment officials get a clear message that the corruption and \nkickbacks of the Saddam Hussein regime--potentially aided and abetted \nby U.N. officials--will no longer be tolerated.\n  I thank my colleagues for helping to craft this amendment. Lindsay \nGraham took the lead in achieving this consensus. Senators Chambliss, \nColeman, Lugar, Kyl, Enzi, and the majority leader all made important \ncontributions, as did the minority, in finalizing the language. This \nwas truly a collaborative process.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letters I mentioned earlier be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         United States Representative for United Nations \n           Management and Reform,\n                                       New York, NY, May 10, 2004.\n      Mr. Dileep Nair,\n     Office for Internal Oversight Services, the United Nations, \n         New York, NY.\n       Dear Mr. Nair: The U.S. Mission requests the following \n     documentation/information regarding the Oil-for-Food \n     Programme:\n       --The 55 OIOS internal reviews, or audits, of aspects of \n     the OFF program;\n       --All bank statements for the OFF escrow account at BNP-\n     Paribas;\n       --All Oil Overseer reports previous to October 2001;\n       --Copies of all Customs Reports from the UN's Office of \n     Iraq Programme (OIP) to the 661 Committee that contain \n     pricing reviews with notes of concern about possible \n     overpricing.\n       Please provide these documents by 14 May 2004.

Kennedy,\n     Representative for United Nations Management, United States \n         Mission to the United Nations, New York, NY.\n       Dear Ambassador Kennedy: I refer to your letter to me of 10 \n     May, as well as your previous letters of 20 April and 4 May, \n     seeking documents relating to the Oil-for-Food Programme.\n       As you know, the Secretary-General has established an \n     independent inquiry into allegations relating to the \n     Programme, chaired by Mr. Paul Volcker. You would also be \n     aware that Mr. Volcker has asked the Secretary-General to \n     ensure that all relevant documents are secured solely for the \n     Inquiry's use, and that, on 6 May, Mr. Volcker issued a \n     statement saying that the Inquiry Committee believes non-\n     public documents related to the Programme should not be \n     released during the current preliminary stage of the \n     Inquiry--though it will ``consider appropriate disclosure'' \n     at a later stage, as the investigation proceeds.\n       As the internal reviews and audits of the Programme carried \n     out by this Office, bank statements of the escrow account and \n     letters sent to contractors, come in the category of ``non-\n     public'' documents, these cannot be disclosed at the moment. \n     On the other hand, the reports of the Oil Overseers and of \n     the Customs Reports have already been provided to the United \n     States government in its capacity as a member of the 661 \n     Committee.\n           Yours sincerely,\n                                                      Dileep Nair,\n                                          Under-Secretary General.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may proceed \nfor no more than 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, our Nation launches a 6-year commemoration \nof the 250th anniversary of the French and Indian war. That \ncommemoration is this year. As part of the celebration, Members of the \nSenate and their staffs are invited to a special viewing of a \nhandwritten autobiographical manuscript of George Washington, which \nconveys unique insights of the war and young Washington's personal \nreflections on his experiences. Washington's ``Remarks'' will be on \ndisplay in S-127 in the Capitol on Wednesday, today, from 12 noon until \n3 p.m.\n  George Washington is most commonly remembered as our Nation's first \nPresident and a Revolutionary War commander. Americans are far less \naware of his activities during the French and Indian war. Washington \nnever wrote a memoir, but ``Remarks'' provides a firsthand account of \nhis early life, including his experiences in the French and Indian war.\n  So I hope Senators will take the opportunity to view this important \nmanuscript and learn more about George Washington through this story \npenned in his own hand.\n  Mr. President, in closing, I thank the honorable Ned Rose of \nCharleston, WV, for his thoughtfulness and his efforts in regard to \nhaving this displayed in S-127 of the Capitol today, from 12 noon until \n3 o'clock.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/23/senate-section/article/S7223-2", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7223]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           WHY WE ARE IN IRAQ\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I submitted a column on how we got into \nthe mess in Iraq, which appeared this morning in The State newspaper in \nColumbia, SC. I ask unanimous consent it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Peoples the world around have a history of culture and \n     religion. In the Mideast, the religion is predominantly \n     Muslim and the culture tribal. The Muslim religion is strong, \n     i.e., those that don't conform are considered infidels; those \n     of a tribal culture look for tribal leadership, not \n     democracy. We liberated Kuwait, but it immediately rejected \n     democracy.\n       2. In 1996, a task force was formed in Jerusalem including \n     Richard Perle, Douglas Feith and David Wurmser. They \n     submitted a plan for Israel to incoming Prime Minister \n     Benjamin Netanyahu called Clean Break. It proposed that \n     negotiations with the Palestinians be cut off and, instead, \n     the Mideast be made friendly to Israel by democratizing it. \n     First Lebanon would be bombed, then Syria invaded on the \n     pretext of weapons of mass destruction. Afterward, Saddam \n     Hussein was to be removed in Iraq and replaced with a \n     Hashemite ruler favorable to Israel.\n       The plan was rejected by Netanyahu, so Perle started \n     working for a similar approach to the Mideast for the United \n     States. Taking on the support of Dick Cheney, Paul Wolfowitz, \n     Stephen Cambone, Scooter Libby, Donald Rumsfeld, et al., he \n     enlisted the support of the Project for the New American \n     Century.\n       The plan hit paydirt with the election of George W. Bush. \n     Perle took on the Defense Policy Board. Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz \n     and Feith became one, two and three at the Defense \n     Department, and Cheney as vice president took Scooter Libby \n     and David Wurmser as his deputies. Clean Break was \n     streamlined to go directly into Iraq.\n       Iraq, as a threat to the United States, was all contrived. \n     Richard Clarke stated in his book, Against All Enemies, with \n     John McLaughlin of the CIA confirming, that there was no \n     evidence or intelligence of ``Iraqi support for terrorism \n     against the United States'' from 1993 until 2003 when we \n     invaded. The State Department on 9/11 had a list of 45 \n     countries wherein al Qaeda was operating. While the United \n     States was listed, it didn't list the country of Iraq.\n       President Bush must have known that there were no weapons \n     of mass destruction in Iraq. We have no al Qaeda, no weapons \n     of mass destruction and no terrorism from Iraq; we were \n     intentionally misled by the Bush administration.\n       Which explains why President-elect Bush sought a briefing \n     on Iraq from Defense Secretary William Cohen in January \n     before taking the oath of office and why Iraq was the \n     principal concern at his first National Security Council \n     meeting--all before 9/11. When 9/11 occurred, we knew \n     immediately that it was caused by Osama bin Laden in \n     Afghanistan. Within days we were not only going into \n     Afghanistan, but President Bush was asking for a plan to \n     invade Iraq--even though Iraq had no involvement.\n  After 15 months, Iraq has yet to be secured. Its borders were left \nopen after ``mission accomplished,'' allowing terrorists throughout the \nMideast to come join with the insurgents to reek havoc. As a result, \nour troops are hunkered down, going out to trouble spots and escorting \nconvoys.\n  In the war against terrorism, we've given the terrorists a cause and \ncreated more terrorism. Even though Saddam is gone, the majority of the \nIraqi people want us gone. We have proven ourselves ``infidels.'' With \nmore than 800 GIs killed, 5,000 maimed for life and a cost of $200 \nbillion, come now the generals in command, both Richard Myers and John \nAbizaid, saying we can't win. Back home the cover of The New Republic \nmagazine asks, ``Were We Wrong?''\n  Walking guard duty tonight in Baghdad, a G.I. wonders why he should \nlose his life when his commander says he can't win and the people back \nhome can't make up their mind. Unfortunately, the peoples of the world \nhaven't changed their minds. They are still against us. Heretofore, the \nworld looked to the United States to do the right thing. No more. The \nUnited States has lost its moral authority.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the next vote is on \nthe McConnell amendment numbered 3472 on which the yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered.\n  Under the previous order, there will be 2 minutes of debate evenly \ndivided.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this is a 10-minute vote, is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. Under the previous \norder, subsequent votes will be 10 minutes in length.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Parliamentary inquiry: I understand under the previous \nagreement we are going to have two votes. The first vote will be on the \nMcConnell amendment and the second vote on the Kennedy amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order there are several \npending votes. The next vote after the McConnell amendment will be on \nthe Kennedy amendment.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me describe why the McConnell \namendment is preferable to the Kennedy amendment. My colleagues will be \ngiven an opportunity in the next few minutes to vote on two approaches \nto administration reporting on Iraq. The Kennedy troop estimate \nrequirement is entirely too burdensome. We cannot predict troop levels \n5 years in advance. No one is that good. Political developments in Iraq \nwill drive security estimates so we cannot determine now what our needs \nare going to be years in advance.\n  Kennedy's 30-day requirement would not give the Department of Defense \nenough time to staff a report, much less complete one.\n  I recommend voting for the McConnell alternative which is a \nreasonable reporting requirement from the Defense Department related to \nIraq.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized for 1 minute.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this is for 1 year. June 30th, \nsovereignty is transferred to the Iraqis. American families are \nentitled to know how long their sons and daughters are going to serve \nin Iraq. This is asking for an estimate of how long their sons and \ndaughters are going to be there. They will make that judgment 30 days \nafter this bill is passed into law, then 6 months, and then a year. \nAmerican families who have sons and daughters serving in Iraq need to \nhave some estimate about how long they are going to be there. The \nAmerican people are entitled to that, too.\n  Finally, we have followed this similar kind of reporting with regard \nto Bosnia in the past. This is an appropriate request. American \nfamilies and the American people are entitled to it and the Iraqi \npeople are entitled to it, as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Under the \nprevious order, the vote occurs on agreeing to the McConnell amendment.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Under the previous order, the vote will now \noccur on agreeing to Kennedy amendment No. 3377. This will be preceded \nby 2 minutes of debate evenly divided.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, if you liked the McConnell amendment, you \nhave to love the Kennedy amendment because the McConnell amendment took \nour initial amendment and eliminated estimating the numbers of American \ntroops that are going to be necessary after Iraq reaches sovereignty. \nThat is the principal difference.\n  It does seem to me that after Iraq gets sovereignty on June 30, every \nAmerican family, whether it is those who have sons or daughters serving \nin Iraq, is entitled to the best judgment--and this is an estimate--the \nbest judgment on the number of troops we are going to have serve in \nIraq. That is clear and simple. It is an estimate. There are clear \nexamples where we have done that in the past. We are talking about \nestimating the number of American troops that will serve in Iraq. We \nhave done that time in and time out. That is what the Kennedy amendment \nwould do, embracing the best parts of the McConnell amendment. You can \nhave it all this afternoon in the U.S. Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the argument remains the same as it was \na few moments ago. The question is whether we can require the Defense \nDepartment to predict that which cannot be known. No one knows what the \nfuture troop estimate is going to be. We can't predict troop levels 5 \nyears in advance. The Senator from Massachusetts is trying to require \nthe Defense Department to report something that no Defense Department \ncould possibly report. Therefore, the Kennedy amendment ought to be \nopposed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on \nagreeing to amendment No. 3377.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Corzine \nbe added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, for years, the plan for missile defense, \nwhich is placed in Alaska, provided for 20 interceptors. Suddenly, this \nyear the administration asked for 10 additional interceptors. My \namendment will simply fence the acquisition of these interceptors \npending operational testing. These interceptors and their warheads have \nnever been used in interceptor tests. They are virtually untested.\n  The underlying amendment would allow for the acquisition but would \ncondition that on operational testing. I think we will learn a lot from \noperational testing. I think we should have operational testing. The \nquestion is, Why do we want to buy 10 additional interceptors until we \nlearn what we must before we commit to this $500 million acquisition?\n  I hope my colleagues will support me in this effort.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who seeks time in opposition?\n  The Senator from Virginia is recognized for 1 minute.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I say to colleagues, in all candor, this \nis the third vote on the same issue. They have addressed the issues in \nthis amendment on two occasions, and by significant margin we have \ndecided to reject in any way taking the Missile Defense Program and \nchanging it at this time. They voted on the Levin amendment and \nrejected it. They voted on my amendment, which was to an earlier Reed \namendment on much the same principle, and rejected the amendment of the \nSenator from Rhode Island.\n  I say to my colleagues we have to have some consistency. Regrettably, \nwe are asked for a third vote on the same issue. I strongly urge my \ncolleagues to reject this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senate will come to order.\n  The Senator from West Virginia is recognized to speak for 1 minute on \nhis amendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, this amendment increases U.S. support for \nPlan Colombia. My amendment raises the cap on the number of U.S. \nmilitary and civilian personnel who can participate in Plan Colombia. \nMy amendment fully supports Colombia's war against drug trafficking and \nnarcoterrorists.\n  The difference between this amendment and the administration proposal \ncontained in the bill is that my amendment is intended to meet \nimmediate requirements whereas the administration is projecting future \nrequirements. My amendment increases the military and civilian caps \nfrom 400 to 500 each. The administration's proposal doubles the troop \ncap from 400 to 800 and increases the civilian cap from 400 to 600. By \ntheir own admission, that is far more than either the State or Defense \nDepartment need in Colombia next year.\n  The administration wants flexibility. I believe Congress should \ninsist on accountability and oversight. U.S. military forces are \nalready stretched to the breaking point across the globe. U.S. troops \nin Iraq are being forced to extend their tours as a result of stop-loss \norders. Prospects remain strong that thousands upon thousands of \nAmerican troops will be needed to quell the violence in Iraq for years \nto come.\n  This is not the time, Colombia is not the place, for yet another \nlarge increase in the deployment of U.S. forces overseas. My amendment \nis a responsible approach to support the worthy goals of Plan Colombia \nwhile maintaining congressional oversight on what is an increasingly \ncomplex and dangerous mission. I urge my colleagues to support the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. Who seeks \ntime in opposition?\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I urge colleagues to give the most careful \nconsideration to this amendment. How well each of us knows the \nfragility of\n\n[[Page S7226]]\n\nthe Central American band of countries. Colombia has shown the \nfortitude, the courage, the strength, the sacrifice to take on \nadversity and they have met with success. This is a very modest number \nincrease in troops, essential at this time to keep that forward \nmomentum going. I strongly urge that you vote against the Byrd \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SANCHEZ TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR \n                  THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nmove to executive session.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Juan R. Sanchez, of \nPennsylvania, to be United States District Judge for the Eastern \nDistrict of Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 4 \nminutes of debate on the nomination equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the first nomination is Juan Sanchez. He \nwas born in Puerto Rico. He immigrated to the United States. This is a \ngreat Horatio Alger's success story. He was educated at City College of \nNew York, bachelor's degree with cum laude. He is a graduate of the \nUniversity of Pennsylvania Law School. He has been in the private \npractice of law and has performed community service in the Legal Aid \nSociety for the last 5 years. He has been a common pleas judge in \nChester County, PA.\n  He brings outstanding credentials and is a product of the nominating \npanel organized by my distinguished colleague, Senator Santorum, and \nmyself.\n  I yield to my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the confirmation \nof Judge Juan R. Sanchez to the U.S. District Court, Eastern District \nof Pennsylvania. I thank the President for his nomination of this \nexcellent candidate and to congratulate Judge Sanchez and his family.\n\n  Judge Sanchez is a cum laude graduate of the City College of the City \nUniversity of New York. He received his law degree from the University \nof Pennsylvania Law School in 1981. Since 1998, he has served as a \njudge on the Court of Common Pleas, 15th Judicial District of \nPennsylvania in West Chester, PA.\n  Judge Sanchez brings to the bench wide-ranging legal experience. He \nserved as a staff attorney for Legal Aid of Chester County in West \nChester, PA, from 1981 to 1983. He had a general legal practice and was \na partner with Nester, Nester & Sanchez from 1983 to 1990. He as a sole \npractitioner from 1990 to 1997. Judge Sanchez also served as a senior \ntrial attorney at MacElree, Harvey, Gallagher, Featherman & Sebastian. \nJudge Sanchez serves as an adjunct professor at West Chester \nUniversity, Immaculata University, and Villanova University School of \nLaw.\n  Judge Sanchez has served his community in numerous ways. He has \nserved on the board of Centro Guayacan, a multicultural educational \ncommunity center, Riverside Care of Chester County, Chester County \nHospital, the YMCA of Central Chester County and the YMCA of Brandywine \nValley, the Volunteer English Program in Chester County, and Community \nVolunteers in Medicine. He has also served as a commissioner for the \nHousing Authority of Chester County and as an advisor to the United Way \nof Chester County. He has received several awards for his service as a \njudge and his service to the community.\n  Again, I express my strong support for his nomination. I thank Judge \nSanchez for his willingness to serve Pennsylvania on the Federal bench. \nI look forward to his approval by the Senate and urge my colleagues to \nsupport his confirmation.\n  In addition to what Senator Specter said, this man has made a \ntremendous contribution to the Hispanic community in Chester County and \nhas done a lot in the strengthening and building of that community. He \nhas great legal talent to go along with it. He is truly an \nextraordinary person, will be an extraordinary judge, and has been an \nextraordinary judge in Chester County.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I note by this vote that 20 of the 44 \nactive Federal circuit court district judges from Pennsylvania will be \nmade up of nominees of President Bush. I mention this because some \nthink that somehow he has not been able to get a lot of nominations \nthrough. This is a sharp contrast to the way vacancies in Pennsylvania \nwere left unfilled during Republican control of the Senate when \nPresident Clinton was in the White House. Republicans denied votes to \nnine districts and one circuit court nominee of President Clinton in \nPennsylvania. That was notwithstanding the very honest due diligence of \nthe senior Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Specter, who tried to get \nthem confirmed. Others in his party blocked a vote. I do not want to \nsee that happen again in Pennsylvania.\n  Today the Senate considers the nomination of Juan Ramon Sanchez to be \na United States District Judge for the Eastern District of \nPennsylvania. I am glad that the Republican majority has finally \ndecided to proceed to this well-qualified Hispanic nominee, since they \ndeparted from the order of the Executive Calendar last week and did not \nschedule a confirmation vote for Mr. Sanchez, despite the fact that he \nwould have received unanimous Democrat support.\n  Judge Sanchez has served as a judge on the Court of Common Pleas in \nChester County, PA since 1998. Prior to that, he worked for Legal Aid \nof Chester County, in private practice, and as a senior trial attorney \nwith the Chester County Public Defender's Office. Judge Sanchez has \ndevoted a substantial amount of time to pro bono work in his community \nand, in particular, to assisting Latino individuals and groups\n\n[[Page S7227]]\n\nin various legal matters, including housing, employment, and \nimmigration. He has also served on the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's \nCommittee on Racial and Gender Bias in the Justice System and the \nRacial Ethnic Bias Implementation Committee of the Judicial Council.\n  While some people have accused Democrats of being anti-Hispanic, our \nrecord of confirming Hispanic nominees is excellent. Judge Sanchez is \nthe 18th Latino confirmed to the Federal courts in the past three \nyears. With the exception of Mr. Estrada, who failed to answer many \nquestions and provide the Senate with his writings and views, we have \npressed forward to confirm all of the other Latinos whose nominations \nhave been reported to the floor. Democrats have supported the swift \nconfirmation of 18 of President Bush's 22 Latino nominees.\n  While President Clinton nominated 11 Latino nominees to Circuit Court \npositions, three of those 11 were blocked by the Republican Senate and \nnever given a vote. President Bush has only nominated four Latino \nnominees to Circuit Court positions, three of whom have been confirmed \nwith Democratic support. President Bush's 22 Latino nominees constitute \nless than 10 percent of his nominees, even though Latinos make up a \nlarger percentage of the U.S. population.\n  It is revealing that this President has nominated more people \nassociated with the Federalist Society than Hispanics, African \nAmericans and Asian Americans, combined. While President Clinton cared \ndeeply about diversity on the Federal bench, this President is more \ninterested in narrow and slanted judicial ideology. Forty-five of \nPresident Bush's nominees to the Federal courts have been actively \ninvolved, either as members or speakers, in the Federalist Society.\n  The Federalist Society is sometimes mischaracterized as a mere \ndebating society, but according to its own statement of purpose, it is \na group with a point of view: ``The Federalist Society for Law and \nPublic Policy Studies is a group of conservatives and libertarians \ninterested in the current state of the legal order.'' One of the goals \nof the Federalist Society is the ``reordering of priorities within the \nlegal system.''\n  The administration wants to have it both ways. They want to take \ncredit with the Federalist Society and hard-right conservatives when \nthey nominate ideological nominees, but they want to pretend that \nideology does not matter. If ideology does not matter to the President, \nwhy has he nominated more members of the Federalist Society than he has \nmembers of minority groups? The President has shown that he is \nsteadfastly committed to packing the courts with individuals who will \nshape the bench according to his ideological goals rather than creating \ncourts that are fair, balanced, independent, and reflective of the \ndiversity within our country.\n  A look at the Federal judiciary in Pennsylvania demonstrates yet \nagain that President Bush's nominees have been treated far better than \nPresident Clinton's and shows dramatically how Democrats have worked in \na bipartisan way to fill vacancies, despite the fact that Republicans \nblocked more than 60 of President Clinton's judicial nominees. With \nthis confirmation, 20 of President Bush's nominees to the Federal \ncourts in Pennsylvania will have been confirmed, more than for any \nother state.\n  With this confirmation, President Bush's nominees will make up 20 of \nthe 44 active Federal circuit and district court judges for \nPennsylvania--that is more than 40 percent of the Pennsylvania Federal \nbench. On the Pennsylvania district courts alone, President Bush's \ninfluence is even stronger, as his nominees will now hold 17 of the 36 \nactive seats. In other words, nearly half of the district court seats \nin Pennsylvania will be held by President Bush's appointees. Republican \nappointees will outnumber Democratic appointees by nearly two to one.\n  This is in sharp contrast to the way vacancies in Pennsylvania were \nleft unfilled during Republican control of the Senate when President \nClinton was in the White House. Republicans denied votes to nine \ndistrict and one circuit court nominees of President Clinton in \nPennsylvania alone. Despite the efforts and diligence of the senior \nSenator from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter, to secure the confirmation \nof all of the judicial nominees from every part of his home state there \nwere 10 nominees by President Clinton to Pennsylvania vacancies who \nnever got a vote. Despite records that showed these to be well-\nqualified nominees, many of their nominations sat pending before the \nSenate for more than a year without being considered. Such obstruction \nprovided President Bush with a significant opportunity to shape the \nbench according to his partisan and ideological goals.\n  New articles in Pennsylvania have highlighted the way that President \nBush has been able to reshape the Federal bench in Pennsylvania. For \nexample, The Philadelphia Inquirer, observed that the significant \nnumber of vacancies on the Pennsylvania courts ``present Republicans \nwith an opportunity to shape the judicial makeup of the court for years \nto come.''\n  Like other nominees of President Bush, Judge Sanchez has been very \ninvolved in the Republican party. He has assured me that he will be \nfair to all those who come before him. I hope that he will follow the \nlaw and treat all who appear before him fairly regardless of their \nideology or party affiliation.\n  I congratulate Mr. Sanchez and his family today on his confirmation.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased today to speak in support of \nJuan Sanchez, who has been nominated to be a United States District \nJudge for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.\n  Judge Sanchez is exceptionally qualified for the Federal bench. He \npresently serves on the Court of Common Pleas in the 15th Judicial \nDistrict of Pennsylvania, having been elected to that position in 1997.\n  Upon graduating from the University of Pennsylvania Law School in \n1981, he became a staff attorney for Legal Aid of Chester County. Two \nyears later, he joined the Chester County Public Defender's Office as a \nsenior trial attorney--a position that he retained until 1997. During \nthat period, Judge Sanchez also worked for two law firms and as a sole \npractitioner, representing Spanish-speaking individuals in a wide \nvariety of legal areas.\n  Judge Sanchez has dedicated his career to serving the disadvantaged \nin Chester County, PA, and his impressive credentials are reflected in \nhis unanimous ``Well Qualified'' rating by the American Bar \nAssociation.\n  Judge Sanchez is an extremely well-qualified nominee. I am confident \nthat he will be a fine addition to the bench and urge my colleagues to \njoin me in supporting his confirmation.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). Is there a sufficient second? \nThere is a sufficient second.\n  The question is, will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Juan R. Sanchez, of Pennsylvania, to be United States District Judge \nfor the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry) \nis necessarily absent.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I announce that the Senator from Kansas (Mr. \nBrownback) is necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that if present and voting the Senator from Kansas \n(Mr. Brownback) would vote ``yea''.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

KELLEY, JR. TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n                  FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF VIRGINIA\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will state the nomination.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Walter D. \nKelley, of Virginia to be United States District Judge for the Eastern \nDistrict of Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee is \nhere. Senator Allen and I need to have a few minutes together.\n  There is no greater responsibility as a Senator than selecting for \nrecommendation to a President our nominees to the Federal judiciary. I \nhave known Mr. Kelley for many years. He graduated cum laude from my \nalma mater, Washington and Lee University. After working for a year as \na press secretary to a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, he \nreturned to Washington and Lee and earned his law degree magna cum \nlaude.\n  Subsequent to law school, Mr. Kelley served as a law clerk to a judge \non the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York City. \nWe are fortunate that when he completed his clerkship, Mr. Kelley \nreturned home to Norfolk, VA, where he practiced law with great \ndistinction.\n  Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution provides the President with \nthe authority to nominate, with the ``Advice and Consent of the \nSenate,'' individuals to serve as judges on the Federal courts. Thus, \nthe Constitution provides a role for both the President and the Senate \nin this process. The President has the power to nominate, and the \nSenate has the power to render ``Advice and Consent'' on the \nnomination.\n  In fulfillment of this constitutional responsibility, after Judge \nMorgan of the Eastern District of Virginia bench took senior status, \nSenator Allen and I had the honor of recommending Walter Kelley to \nPresident Bush to fill that vacancy. After reviewing our \nrecommendations, President Bush nominated Mr. Kelley.\n  Mr. Kelley's nomination was subsequently received by the Senate, and \nin a timely fashion, the Senate Judiciary Committee provided its \nunanimous approval of this nominee. I am grateful to Chairman Hatch and \nSenator Leahy for their hard work in moving this nomination forward. \nAnd, I am grateful to the leadership on both sides of the aisle for \nbringing Mr. Kelley's nomination before the full Senate.\n  When Senator Allen and I first learned of the vacancy on the Eastern \nDistrict of Virginia bench, we began our search to find the most \nqualified and well-respected individual to fill that vacancy. During \nthat process, one name repeatedly was brought up. That name was Walt \nKelley.\n  Walt Kelley graduated with his bachelor's degree, cum laude, in 1977 \nfrom my alma mater, Washington & Lee University. Then, after working \nfor a year as a Press Secretary to a member of the United States House \nof Representatives, he returned to Washington & Lee and earned his law \ndegree, magna cum laude.\n  Subsequent to law school, Mr. Kelley served as a law clerk to a judge \non the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in New \nYork City. We are fortunate in Virginia that after he completed his \nclerkship, Mr. Kelley returned to his home town of Norfolk, VA to \npractice law.\n  Since then, for the past 22 years, Walt Kelley has practiced law for \ntwo of Virginia's best law firms, Wilcox & Savage PC, and Troutman \nSanders LLP. During these two decades plus of his legal career, his \npractice has focused primarily on complex business litigation before \nthe Federal courts.\n  Moreover, during these 22 years, Mr. Kelley has earned a reputation \nfor not only being one of the best lawyers in Virginia, but also being \none of the best lawyers in America. Each year, since 1997, he has been \nlisted in The Best Lawyers in America for business litigation. This is \na publication that lists the ``best'' lawyers in America based on the \nrecommendations of other lawyers all across America.\n  But, not only is Mr. Kelley dedicated to his family and to his legal \ncareer, he also has taken the time to give back to his community. In \naddition to other community activities, he is a member and the former \nrector of the Old Dominion University Board of Visitors in Norfolk, VA, \nand he is a member of the Virginia Business Higher Education Council.\n  Mr. President, Walt Kelley has my strong support and the strong \nsupport of Senator Allen. In addition, he has the support of Virginia's \nlegal community. The Virginia State Bar; Virginia Bar Association; the \nVirginia Association of Defense Attorneys; and the Norfolk & Portsmouth \nBar Association all support Mr. Kelley's nomination. Furthermore, the \nAmerican Bar Association has unanimously rated Mr. Kelley as ``well \nqualified'' for this judgeship.\n  I know that Walt Kelley is a fine nominee. If confirmed, he will \nserve on the bench in Virginia with distinction.\n  I urge my colleagues to support his nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from Virginia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I join my colleague and friend, Senator \nWarner, in endorsing Walt Kelley for this judgeship for the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. I have known him \nfor many decades. He is a patient man and an outstanding lawyer.\n  Senator Warner and I interviewed many highly qualified candidates for \nthat judgeship in the Eastern District of Virginia. Walt Kelley has \nextensive trial experience and, most importantly, has the right \nphilosophy as a judge and will not invent the law but interpret it \naccording to the facts.\n  I hope my colleagues will support his nomination.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support \nfor the confirmation of Walter D. Kelley Jr. to serve as a judge for \nthe United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia.\n  Mr. Kelley received both his undergraduate and his law degree, magna \ncum laude, from Washington and Lee University. Upon graduation from law \nschool, he clerked for Judge Ellsworth Van Graafeiland on the Second \nCircuit.\n  In 1982, he joined the Norfolk, VA, law firm of Wilcox and Savage. \nSince 2001, he has been a partner at Troutman Sanders in Norfolk, where \nhe practices in the area of business litigation with an emphasis on \nintellectual property and antitrust law.\n  Aside from his private practice, Mr. Kelley has devoted significant \ntime to improving the legal community as a leader in bar activities. He \nhas served as a mentor to younger attorneys, a quasi-judge of the \nNorfolk Circuit Court, and as a law professor. He also served on the \nVirginia Attorney General's Task Force on Higher Education; as rector \nand a member of Old Dominion University Board of Visitors; as a \nchairman and director of the Hampton Roads Board of the Salvation Army; \nand as a trustee of the Norfolk Collegiate School.\n  Walter Kelley is an extremely well-qualified nominee with a \nsignificant amount of litigation experience. The American Bar \nAssociation unanimously bestowed on him its highest rating of ``Well \nQualified,'' in recognition of his outstanding legal skills and \nreputation. He will make an excellent addition to the Federal bench and \nI urge my colleagues to join me in supporting his confirmation.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today we are asked to consider the \nnomination of Walter Kelley, Jr. to the Eastern District of Virginia. \nMr. Kelley is currently a partner with the Norfolk office of the \nTroutman Sanders law firm. He has significant civil litigation \nexperience. The ABA unanimously found Mr. Kelley to be well-qualified \nto be a district court judge. He also has the support of both of his \nhome-State Senators.\n  It should be noted that Mr. Kelley has been very active in Republican \npolitics over the past several decades. Mr. Kelley recently served as \nthe Chairman of the Republican Party of Norfolk for\n\n[[Page S7229]]\n\nfour years. He is currently involved in a Republican political action \ncommittee and serves as Director of the Downtown Republican Club. A few \nyears ago, upon being elected Rector of the Old Dominion University \nBoard of Visitors, Mr. Kelley was asked about the political nature of \nthe position and politics in general, when he answered, ``[i]f you \nreally believe strongly in how it is you think Government should act \nwith the citizenry . . . you can't sit on the sidelines and not be in \nthe game. You're either in there trying to make happen that which you \nbelieve in, or you're ceding the whole debate to the other side.''\n  I trust that Mr. Kelley will not believe that he can continue this \nadvocacy as a judge. By taking his oath of office he will be expected \nto assume a position of impartiality and discard his previous partisan \nadvocacy. Certainly, we can all agree that the Federal bench is not the \nplace to advocate any agenda other than fairness.\n  I congratulate Mr. Kelley and his family on his confirmation today.\n  Mr. President, again, he had the highest ABA rating and is strongly \nsupported by the two Senators from Virginia. I hope everybody on this \nside of the aisle will vote for him.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Shall the Senate advise and consent to the \nnomination of Walter D. Kelley, Jr., of Virginia, to be United States \nDistrict Judge for the Eastern District of Virginia?\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, briefly I have a consent regarding the \nclass action legislation which has been cleared on both sides. Before \nproceeding, I remind everyone that an earlier order provided we would \nproceed to the class action legislation following completion of Defense \nauthorization, which I expect we will be able to complete today. \nHowever, we now have a Defense appropriations bill available and it is \nvitally important for us to proceed with that bill to ensure no \ndisruption in funds to our troops. Having said that, this agreement \nwill allow us to proceed to the class action legislation without any \nprocedural hurdles following the Defense appropriations bill.\n  Therefore, I now ask unanimous consent that the previous order with \nrespect to Calendar No. 430, S. 2062, the class action bill, be \nvitiated and further that the Senate proceed to its consideration \nfollowing the disposition of the Defense appropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object, I want to make sure I \nunderstand. The majority leader is proposing that we go to class action \nimmediately following the completion of our work on the Defense \nappropriations bill; is that correct?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, that is correct. The clarification I made \nwas that initially we would follow the Defense authorization with class \naction. Now in effect what we are doing is we are going to finish the \nDefense authorization today, go to Defense appropriations, to be \nfollowed by class action.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I appreciate that. I have made it clear I \nam not a supporter of the class action bill, but I have made a \ncommitment to many of the colleagues in my caucus with regard to the \nassurances we have provided to them in the past that they would have a \nchance to have this legislation brought before the Senate and offer the \nappropriate amendments. They have been very patient. We have asked them \nto delay consideration of this bill now on several occasions, but with \nthe assurances given by the majority leader, I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Reserving the right to object, I will not object, I \nexpress my thanks to both leaders for that colloquy and this brief \ndiscussion we have had. As both leaders know, the movement of this \nlegislation is a priority for a number of us, certainly for me, and I \nam gratified that once we have disposed of the Defense appropriations \nbill, the next bill we will turn to is class action. I express my \nthanks to the majority leader for making that clear, and to the \nDemocratic leader, Senator Daschle, for his steadfast position, \nrealizing this is not legislation that is at the top of his list of \npriorities.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to inform my colleagues and all \nwho are watching that a wonderful American passed away yesterday. He \nwas a 13-year-old boy who lost his life to muscular dystrophy. He was \nknown to the world because of his many appearances on radio and TV \nreading his poetry. His name was Matthew Joseph Thadeus Stepanek. The \nworld knew him as ``Mattie.''\n  Though this young man's death is a great tragedy, his life was a \ntriumph. At age 13, he was a gifted author. He was even a noted \npeacemaker. He took a personal challenge and turned it into a life of \ninspiration for all of us.\n  Mattie Stepanek once said, ``I want my message to live beyond me,'' \nand it certainly will. His message of peace and hope has reached \nmillions.\n  He was born in 1990 in Upper Marlboro, MD, and doctors did not expect \nhim to live more than 24 hours. He suffered from a rare form of \nmuscular dystrophy. He had two brothers and a sister, all who died \nbefore the age of 4. His own mom also has muscular dystrophy.\n\n  Though the disease would eventually render him unable to walk or \nbreathe\n\n[[Page S7230]]\n\non his own, he was more than a survivor. He began writing poetry at the \nage of 3; poems about hope, peace, love. His life philosophy was, \n``Remember to play after every storm.'' And he did.\n  Mattie believed wishes could come true. Once when he was near death, \nhe said he had three wishes. He wanted to talk to Jimmy Carter; he \nwanted to have his book of poems published; and he wanted to see his \npoetry read on Oprah.\n  Guess what. All three happened. President Carter did call him and \ntalk to him several times. He wrote several volumes of poetry. I have \none with me today called ``Heartsongs.'' This book reached the best \nseller's list because it reached the hearts of so many people. As soon \nas Oprah heard it, she had not only read his poetry but had Mattie on \nthe show.\n  He was so sick at times the doctors were afraid he wouldn't make it, \nbut through hope and prayer his life was saved, one miracle at a time.\n  After the chaos and confusion and heartbreak of September 11 and the \nterrible anthrax attack on the Capitol, I was pretty grief stricken. \nOne night watching C-SPAN, like so many Americans at the end of the \nday, I saw this wonderful young boy reading poetry. I found his words \nso inspirational, so touching, that I immediately contacted him through \nhis hospital, the wonderful Children's Hospital here in Washington.\n  Through the hospital, I arranged a visit to him at his home in Upper \nMarlboro, Maryland. I visited with Mattie and his mom, in their \napartment especially arranged for people who live a life in wheelchairs \nbut refuse to be handicapped. We had a great time, talking about life. \nMattie was so lively, so witty. He was so filled with enthusiasm. He \nwas filled with energy.\n  I brought the book that I wrote and he had his. I did a little \nreading from mine and he read his poems. It was a great afternoon with \nthis special boy, there he was in a special motorized wheelchair with a \nspecial apparatus that enabled him to breathe.\n  Later on, I went to the Children's Hospital to give him the \nChildren's Hope Medal of Honor. This medal is given to young heroes who \nhave shown valiant effort and courage in facing life's daily challenges \nwhen they have a chronic or life-threatening illness. If anyone \ndeserved it, Mattie deserved it.\n  I want the world to know who this little boy is. I want to tell you \nfirst of all what he said about himself and then what he said to us in \nwhat then proved to be a farewell. This is the poem.\n\n     I am Mattie J.T. Stepanek.\n     My body has light skin,\n     Red blood, blue eyes, and blond hair.\n     Since I have mitochondrial myopathy,\n     I even have a trach, a ventilator, and oxygen.\n     Very poetic, I am, and very smart, too.\n     I am always brainstorming ideas and stories.\n     I am a survivor, but some day, I will see\n     My two brothers and one sister in Heaven.\n     When I grow up, I plan to become\n     A daddy, a writer, a public speaker,\n     And most of all, a peacemaker.\n     Whoever I am, and whatever happens,\n     I will always love my body and mind,\n     Even if it has different abilities\n     Than other peoples' bodies and minds.\n     I will always be happy, because\n     I will always be me.\n\n  Isn't that great? But the last page in his book is ``The Daily \nGift.''\n\n       You know what?\n       Tomorrow is a new day.\n       And today is a new day.\n       Actually,\n       Every day is a new day.\n       Thank you, God,\n       For all of these\n       Special and new days.\n\n  Mr. President, thank God for Mattie Stepanek and thank God for a \nloving, wonderful mother, Jeni Stepanek. Our hearts go out to express \nour condolences and our sympathy to her for all of the heartache she \nhas had to endure. But we thank her for giving us this very special \ngift, Mattie Stepanek, who truly sang from his heart and was a \npeacemaker.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the distinguished Senator from Maryland for what \nshe had to say. My wife and I got to know Mattie. My wife invited him \nto speak at the spouses dinner, the First Lady's luncheon. She told me \nI had to come down and meet this young man. I remember coming in there \nand talking with him. I also talked with him again by phone. I sort of \nhung back because I was not a Senate spouse. I sort of hung back in the \ncorner and listened when he spoke. What an inspirational little boy.\n  I know the tug I felt when I turned on the news this morning and \nheard what we all knew was going to happen had happened. He is no \nlonger with us.\n  Somebody in the news said he probably had more life in that short \nspan than most people have. The Senator from Maryland said similar \nthings. In this case, it is true. He really had.\n  I thank her for her statement. I know Marcelle and I had our hearts \nenriched by having met him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/23/senate-section/article/S7230-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7230-S7231]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2005--Continued\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have the floor, though I see the \ndistinguished Senator from Virginia and, of course, I will yield to him \nif he is seeking the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes, Mr. President, I am seeking the floor at this point \nin time.\n  We have reached a juncture in the bill where the majority leader and \nthe distinguished minority leader, together with the two managers, are \ntrying to resolve what further business may occur on this bill. At this \npoint in time I can only suggest to colleagues we are very close, \nhopefully, to resolving this matter. But until such time as we get an \nindication on my side of the aisle of the ability with regard to the \nother side to reach constructive resolution of this matter, I am going \nto have to ask that a quorum be put in.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if the Senator----\n  Mr. WARNER. Reserving the right to the floor, I yield for a question \nfrom my colleague.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I wanted to accommodate the distinguished chairman, of \ncourse. I thought he was about to bring something up. I hope he would \nnot put in a quorum call. I would like to speak about some of the \nmatters that may be coming up later. I have been talking with him and \nSenator Reid and Senator Levin. If it becomes ripe to make that \nagreement, naturally I would yield the floor immediately as I did for \nthe chairman. But I find in the joys of allergies, my voice is fast \ndisappearing and I would like to speak now while I know I can so speak.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, my good friend and I have done many things \ntogether. At this point in time, I think, in good faith, the leadership \nof the Senate, together with the two managers, has developed a \nconstruct. Until such time as that construct is put in place, I must \nsay with due respect I will have to maintain the quorum call.\n  Mr. LEAHY. If the Senator will yield again before he did that? I \nnote, as the Senator knows, I could be speaking now if I wanted to \nbecause I already had the floor and I could have refused to yield to \nhim. I did not.\n  Mr. WARNER. I think you yielded to me.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yielded to him, and had I not done that, of course I \nwould have retained the floor and would have gone forth.\n  Yesterday we had hours upon hours of quorum calls. All I am \nsuggesting is that I be allowed to continue, and at such point as the \nSenator reaches an agreement, I would, of course, yield to whomever \nwishes to make the unanimous consent request. Being unable to do that, \nI believe my courtesy in giving up the position I had has not been \nreturned. But, of course, the Senator has the parliamentary right to do \nwhatever he wants because he has the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I hope this is not a matter of courtesy. \nIt is a matter of pure management of the bill. There has been a clear \nunderstanding between both sides, and I am abiding by the understanding \non this side. I think this side has, in good faith, lived up to its \ncommitments. From all I know, the manager on this side and the \nleadership on that side is doing everything to live up to their \ncommitments.\n  Until that time, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n\n[[Page S7231]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I believe good progress is being made. I \nthink there could be a proper utilization of the time.

Twenty minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Let us say 15 minutes with the exception of the Senator \nfrom Vermont, who desires 20 minutes, and hopefully Senators who might \nwish to address issues relating to the bill can avail themselves of \nthat opportunity. Would that be correct?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object, I surely will not, it is \nour intent I believe at the end of this first period to have our \nstructure put back in place--that we would immediately return to the \nbill and resolve it.\n  Mr. WARNER.

I refer to \nthe distinguished senior Senator from Virginia as ``my Senator'' when I \nam away from home.

Mr. President, I understand that at the time the Leahy \namendment comes up, there is likely to be a tabling motion. It would \nbe, in effect, a second-degree amendment offered by others on the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  The amendment would require the Attorney General to produce documents \nthat the Judiciary Committee needs in order to conduct oversight of the \nDepartment of Justice.\n  The Judiciary Committee has to get to the bottom of the prisoner \nabuse scandal. Aspects of this scandal are within the jurisdiction of \nthe Judiciary Committee. To get to the bottom of it, we require \ndocuments from the Attorney General.\n  What happens if we are blocked from that? I say to my friends that if \nthey vote to block us from getting the documents we seek, what they are \ndoing, whether intentionally or otherwise, is contributing to a \ncoverup.\n  Let me explain why this amendment is so important. There has been \nmuch debate over the last several days and weeks about the abuse of \nforeign prisoners, and the guidance provided by the President's lawyers \nwith regard to torture. This debate will continue for some time \nthroughout our country, particularly as more courts-martial are held, \nwith the facts emerging slowly, and as the White House releases only \nsome of the documents that are needed to fully understand the origins \nof the scandal.\n\n  In the meantime, the Senate, the body that is supposed to be the \nconscience of the Nation, should act. There are some very basic things \nwe can do to clarify U.S. policy regarding the treatment of foreign \nprisoners. We can bring greater transparency to this issue. That is \nwhat my amendment does. It is very straightforward, with three basic \nsections.\n  First, it lays out U.S. policy with regard to the treatment of \nprisoners. Second, it establishes basic reporting requirements to which \nthe Congress and the American people are entitled. Finally, it sets out \na training requirement for civilian contractors who come into contact \nwith foreign prisoners.\n  With regard to the policy, my amendment is very forthright. It states \nthat the United States must treat all foreign prisoners humanely and in \na manner that the United States would consider legal if perpetrated by \nthe enemy against an American prisoner. That is a restatement of many \ndecades of U.S. policy and the Army's own regulations.\n  My amendment also reaffirms the obligation of the United States to \nabide by the legal prohibitions against torture. That is the law of the \nland.\n  The memos authored by the Justice Department apparently reveal \nanother view: that torture can be ordered by the President despite \nclear laws in the United States against it. Even President Bush now \nsays he disagrees with that view.\n  We should reaffirm that torture is not allowed under any \ncircumstances.\n  The amendment also codifies the longstanding Army regulation \ngoverning the treatment of foreign prisoners. That regulation states \nthat where there is doubt about the legal status of a foreign prisoner, \nthen the prisoner is entitled to the protection of the Geneva \nConvention, at least until a status can be appropriately determined by \na ``competent tribunal.'' The procedures for the tribunal are specified \nin regulation.\n  Unfortunately, our government has ignored this regulation during the \ncourse of the war on terrorism and the war in Afghanistan. No such \nscreenings have been conducted in Afghanistan. The administration \nsimply designates someone as a terrorist and that is enough to land \nthem in prison indefinitely.\n  We have not had one trial by military commission yet. And certainly \nwe determined that some of these people we called terrorists, who could \nbe held indefinitely, were not terrorists, because we let some people \ngo. I suspect some more people will be let go.\n  We are in this bind because the administration failed to follow the \nArmy's own guidance. The military lawyers knew there would be \nsituations when the legal status of a foreign person captured by our \ntroops was not clear, so they devised a very careful, very basic \nscreening process. By conducting these status hearings, we would then \nknow what rights and what legal protections the individual is entitled \nto. That is the military policy. It is certainly the policy our U.S. \nmilitary wants other countries to follow, and the one we said we will \nfollow.\n  My amendment further states that it is in the interest of the United \nStates to expeditiously prosecute the cases of those held at Guantanamo \nBay. We have given the administration wide latitude in how it operates \nin Guantanamo. Congress understands we are fighting a new kind of war, \none where civilians are at great risk, where intelligence is critical, \nand where the country has to be tough against its enemy.\n  Having said that, after all the months and years we held prisoners in \nGuantanamo, not a single case has been prosecuted. Not five, not four, \nnot three, not two, not one. Not a single prosecution. One would think \nthat with the thousands of lawyers in our military and our Justice \nDepartment, we could act with some greater dispatch. One would think \nthat of all the people locked up indefinitely, we could have found one, \njust one, in all those prisoners that we could have prosecuted. But \nthat is not the case.\n\n  For the bad actors, the murders, the terrorists at Guantanamo, we \nneed to bring charges against them so that the victims of their crimes \ncan have justice and so that those accused, if found guilty, can \nfinally have their fate determined. These indefinite detentions, where \nnobody is prosecuted, where no actions are taken, are contrary to our \nlegal system and contrary to the security interests of the United \nStates.\n  In the reporting section of my amendment, I ask for four basic pieces \nof information: One, a quarterly report providing the number of \nprisoners who were denied prisoner of war status and the basis for \ndenying that status; two, the proposed plan for holding military \ncommissions at Guantanamo Bay; third, previous Red Cross reports \nprovided to the military regarding the treatment of prisoners--the ICRC \nreports can be submitted in classified form as the ICRC has requested; \nand four, a report setting forth prisoner interrogation techniques that \nhave been approved by the administration.\n  Much of this information has dribbled out in press reports and \nthrough leaks. Why don't we set the record straight and let the \nAmerican people have access to this information?\n\n[[Page S7232]]\n\n  The administration ought to have a more orderly process in place for \ndisclosing this information. It will require some structured reporting \nthat is long overdue.\n  Finally, we know that many prison abuses were carried out by civilian \ncontractors. We do not know who these people are, where they came from, \nor what they were trained to do. At a minimum, we should require these \ncontractors, just as we require of our military personnel, to be \ntrained in the laws of war and international humanitarian law. It is \nimperative they understand what the law requires when it comes to the \ntreatment of foreign prisoners.\n  There is nothing complicated about this amendment. It simply sets out \na more coherent framework with regard to how we treat foreign \nprisoners.\n  Now, let me turn to the portion of the amendment that I suspect will \nbe subject to a tabling motion--the second-degree amendment.\n  There is a popular expression used when a group of people mean to \nwork together to protect against possible harm or danger. It is called \n``circling the wagons,'' and it comes from American pioneers, who used \nto form their wagons into a circle to better defend against an attack.\n  If a move is made to table this amendment, I would say that we are \nseeing a circling of the wagons by Republicans on behalf of the \nadministration so that none of the information we seek can come out. I \nfind that regrettable, but it is not surprising. It is an election \nyear.\n  Americans are becoming increasingly concerned about the \nadministration's handling of the war in Iraq: no weapons of mass \ndestruction, the disingenuous link to the September 11 attacks, the \nleak of a CIA operative's name, the months of continued violence \nagainst Coalition soldiers after the President had proclaimed victory, \nand then the photographs out of Abu Ghraib. The American public is sick \nand tired of being lied to. They are sick of the secrecy. They want \nanswers, but the wagons continue to circle.\n  This amendment requires the administration to cooperate with a \nthorough congressional investigation, by Republicans and Democrats \nalike, into the abuse of prisoners in U.S. custody. It requires the \nrelease of all documents relative to the scandal. All documents--not \njust a few selected by the administration when the pressure is on.\n  I would say this: Those who want to keep these documents hidden \nshould know that at some point the day of reckoning is going to come. \nWe are now at a crisis point. Is the Senate of the United States \ncontent to serve as an arm of the Executive Branch? Water flows \ndownhill, and so does Government policy. Somewhere in the upper reaches \nof this administration a process was set in motion that seeped forward \nuntil it produced this scandal. To put this scandal behind us, first we \nhave to understand what happened. And we cannot get to the bottom of \nthis until there is a clear picture of what happened at the top.\n  For many months, the Attorney General and other senior administration \nofficials have refused to answer letter requests for documents relating \nto the interrogations of detainees abroad.\n  Earlier this month, the Attorney General appeared before the \nJudiciary Committee for the very first time since the war in Iraq \nbegan, but he refused to answer direct questions posed by Senators and \nrefused to give us the documents we requested regarding the treatment \nand interrogation of prisoners. And not only that, he offered no legal \nchallenge for his refusal, and practically challenged the Judiciary \nCommittee to subpoena him.\n  When the Judiciary Committee met last week, I proposed a subpoena. \nOur Republican colleagues said it was too broad. We narrowed it down to \n23 specific documents. When the chairman said it was premature, Senator \nFeinstein proposed that we amend the subpoena to give the Attorney \nGeneral more time to produce the documents voluntarily. Even then, it \nwas voted down.\n  Yesterday, in a small gesture in response to public pressure, the \nWhite House released a tiny subset of the materials we sought. All of \nthese should have been produced earlier. Much more remains hidden. Of \nthe 23 we requested, we got 3, and of those 3, 2 had already been \nposted on the Internet. So, in effect, the administration gave us one \nvoluntarily. Though this is a self-serving selection of documents, it \nis a beginning. I give the administration credit for that. But for the \nJudiciary Committee and the Senate to find the whole truth, we will \nneed much more cooperation.\n  The documents released yesterday raised more questions than they \nanswered. The White House released a January 2002 memo signed by \nPresident Bush calling for the humane treatment of detainees. But did \nthe President sign any orders or directives after January 2002? Did he \nsign any with regard to prisoners in Iraq? Why won't the President's \ncounsel comment on what the President said or ordered?\n  Why did Secretary Rumsfeld issue and later rescind tough \ninterrogation techniques? How did these interrogation techniques come \nto be used in Iraq, where the administration maintains that it has \nfollowed the Geneva Conventions?\n  Where is the remaining 95 percent of the material requested by \nmembers of the Senate Judiciary Committee? Why is the White House \nwithholding relevant documents that were produced after April 2003?\n  When are we going to stop sitting on our hands, becoming a \nrubberstamp for an administration cloaked in secrecy?\n  We have the legal right, the constitutional obligation, and the moral \nauthority to ask questions and demand answers today. We have to keep \nthe pressure on until we get honesty and answers. I hope we will stand \nup and say that we are an independent body in the Senate and that we \nare willing to ask questions.\n  More and more, the American people can see that when you ask for 23 \ndocuments, and you only get 3, 2 of which have already been released by \nthe press, that is not cooperation. It is not openness or cooperation \nwhen there is an arbitrary cutoff of documents after April 2003. It is \nnot cooperation when we cannot find out why there is a difference \nbetween the advice that comes from Attorney General Ashcroft's office \nand what the President says he is going to do. And it is certainly not \ncooperation when we cannot get to the root of this terrible disconnect \nbetween stated policy and the photographs of the torture at Abu Ghraib.\n\n  I must say, I am suspicious because I asked about prisoner abuse \nmonths before the pictures came out. I have asked about Afghanistan. I \nwas told that the U.S. was complying with the Torture Convention. But \nwe now find that some prisoners died at the hands of some of the \njailers.\n  I have asked the same questions about Guantanamo, including questions \nlike why do we have hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of detainees, \nbut we cannot find a single one--not even one--we feel confident enough \nto bring charges against before a military commission? It should be one \nof the easiest places in the world, if there is any evidence, to get a \nconviction. Not one trial out of those hundreds and hundreds and \nhundreds of prisoners?\n  Do we wonder why the rest of the world asks whether America has lost \nits moral compass? As an American, I do not think we have. I believe \nvery strongly in the morality of our country. But I worry very much \nabout what some of our leaders are holding back. I wish we would get \nall these matters out. I believe we would be better off if we did. We \nwould look better in the eyes of the rest of the world. The United \nStates is not a country that can and should condone torture. We are a \ncountry that expects to play by the highest rules because we ask others \nto, even when our enemies do not. Even during the two world wars, we \ntreated our prisoners humanely.\n  This is a question we should ask: Why this sudden change in our \npolicies?\n  I will close by reminding my colleagues that I think it was about a \nyear ago the Secretary of Defense said: We will know if we are winning \nthe war on terrorism if we are capturing or killing or stopping more \nterrorists than the madrasas are recruiting and churning out.\n  After Abu Ghraib, I asked the Secretary of Defense: By that \ndefinition, are we winning or not? He said he did not know. Obviously, \nwe are not winning. There are recruiting posters all\n\n[[Page S7233]]\n\nover the Middle East, and even into Turkey, with photographs from Abu \nGhraib.\n  If the administration will not come forward on its own, if the \nadministration will not tell us what is happening, we--at least the men \nand women in the Senate--should have the courage to demand answers.\n  In the weeks since a courageous soldier-whistleblower and a probing \njournalist revealed to the world the abuses at Abu Ghraib prison, \nevidence has continued to seep out almost daily of similar mistreatment \nof prisoners in other U.S. military detention centers in Iraq, \nAfghanistan, and Guantanamo. White House officials and the political \nappointees in the Department of Defense have tried to deflect their own \nresponsibility by singling out a few ``bad apples'' for punishment.\n  But bit by bit, the press is uncovering new information, and it all \npoints toward those higher up in the chain of command.\n  On May 15 of this year, President Bush said, ``The cruelty of a few \nhas brought discredit to their uniform and embarrassment to our \ncountry.'' That statement, it now turns out, was only partly true. \nSince then, we have learned a great deal about what was discussed and \ndebated at the highest levels of our government.\n  While the President insists that he wants to get to the bottom of \nthis, high-level White House and Pentagon officials refuse to answer \nquestions or to disclose the relevant documents requested by the \nCongress.\n  They deny any pattern of illegality in the interrogation and \ntreatment of prisoners, while it becomes clearer by the day that this \nscandal was set in motion by the actions of senior officials.\n  We learned that in October 2003, General Sanchez ordered the \n``harmonization'' of military policing and intelligence in Iraq, \nplacing military intelligence in control of key cellblocks at Abu \nGhraib prison.\n  We learned from the Washington Post that, over the past 18 months, \nthe Army has opened investigations into at least 91 cases of possible \nmisconduct by soldiers against detainees in Iraq and Afghanistan. And \nthe President talks about a few bad apples. The President's comments \nhave become harder and harder to swallow.\n  We learned on June 7 from the Wall Street Journal about a March 2003 \nPentagon report contending that the President was not bound by laws \nprohibiting torture. This report went so far as to say that Government \nagents who tortured prisoners at the President's direction cannot be \nprosecuted by the Justice Department.\n  The very next day, the Washington Post reported that in August 2002 \nthe Justice Department advised the White House that torturing al-Qaida \nterrorists in captivity abroad ``may be justified.'' The memo argued \nthat the President has absolute authority in the ``war against \nterrorism'' and that international treaties against torture, which the \nUnited States ratified, ``may be unconstitutional.'' And, this report \ncontinued, Congress is completely powerless when the President acts as \nCommander in Chief.\n  That same day, the Attorney General made his first appearance before \nthe Judiciary Committee in 15 months. He refused to give a copy of the \nJustice Department memo to members of the committee even though he was \nunable to say on what legal authority he based his refusal.\n  A week later, Republicans on the Judiciary Committee blocked a \nsubpoena seeking these documents. Some called it a ``fishing \nexpedition,'' even though we asked for a grand total of 23 documents.\n  The committee of jurisdiction had the opportunity and the \nresponsibility to get us closer to the truth about why these abuses \noccurred, but the Republicans chose to circle the wagons instead of \ndoing what is right for the country.\n  The stonewalling in the prison abuse scandal has been building to a \ncrisis point. Yesterday, responding to public pressure, the White House \nhas released a small subset of the documents that offers a glimpse into \nthe genesis of this scandal. There are many items missing from this \nrelease, however, including all but three of the 23 items Judiciary \nCommittee Democrats requested in the subpoena that was voted down by \nRepublicans last week. Where are the 20 remaining documents? Perhaps \nthe most ominous omission is the lack of any documents reflecting White \nHouse involvement in this issue since military action began in Iraq \nlast year. The released documents do not include a single reference to \nthe treatment or interrogation of detainees in Iraq, despite the \nheinous abuses at Abu Ghraib that we have all seen with our own eyes.\n  The White House released a Presidential memorandum dated February 7, \n2002, directing that al-Qaida and Taliban detainees be treated \nhumanely. But, did the President sign any directive regarding the \ntreatment or interrogation of detainees after February 7, 2002? More \nspecifically, did the President sign any directive after the United \nStates invaded Iraq on March 19, 2003? These questions remain \nunanswered.\n\n  Last week we learned that Secretary Rumsfeld personally approved \nplans to hide some of the prisoners in Iraq so that they could not be \nvisited by the International Committee of the Red Cross. They became \nnameless, faceless, and numberless. This is not only Kafkaesque, it was \na direct violation of the Geneva Conventions. In a press conference \nlast Thursday, Secretary Rumsfeld acknowledged his role in hiding these \n``ghost prisoners,'' including one ``high value'' prisoner who was lost \nin custody for 7 months.\n  Yet in the same breath, Secretary Rumsfeld said, ``I have not seen \nanything that suggests that a senior civilian or military official of \nthe United States of America . . . could be characterized as ordering \nor authorizing or permitting torture or acts that are inconsistent with \nour international treaty obligations or our laws or our values as a \ncountry.''\n  Secretary Rumsfeld should read the memos written by the Department of \nJustice and by his own legal staff at the Pentagon. The leaked and \nreleased documents reveal plenty to suggest that legal arguments were \nmade and orders were signed in violation of our laws and treaty \nobligations. The few documents released by the White House yesterday \nserve to confirm earlier press reports and postings.\n  A year ago, after learning that the United States might be using \ntechniques that pushed the limits of the Torture Convention, I wrote to \nthe White House looking for assurances that the administration was \ncomplying with U.S. and international law. I received a letter that \nstated clearly and unequivocally that it was and would continue to do \nso.\n  In fact, we now know that the White House and the Pentagon were \nactively working to circumvent the law. Guidelines for interrogating \nprisoners were applied routinely in multiple locations in ways that \nwere illegal. It is also clear that U.S. officials knew the law was \nbeing violated and for months, possibly years, did virtually nothing \nabout it.\n  Instead, they detailed their lawyers to find legal loopholes and \ninterpretations that would redefine torture and devise innocuous \nsounding labels for their interrogation techniques, such as ``sensory \ndeprivation'' or ``stress and duress.''\n  I wrote to the White House, the Pentagon and the CIA last June, a \nyear ago, about the reported torture of Afghan prisoners by U.S. \ninterrogators in December 2003. Two of those prisoners, both of young \nage, had died during interrogation. Others described being forced to \nstand naked in a cold room for days without interruption, with their \narms raised and chained to the ceiling and their swollen ankles \nshackled. They said they were denied sleep and forced to wear hoods \nthat cut off the supply of oxygen.\n  My letter, and subsequent letters, were either ignored or received \nresponses which, in retrospect, bore no resemblance to the facts. \nSixteen months later, the investigations of those deaths, ruled \nhomicides, remain incomplete.\n  Just last week, in a case we had not known of previously, a CIA \ncontractor was indicted for beating an Afghan detainee with a large \nflashlight. The Afghan, who had surrendered himself at the gates of a \nU.S. military base, died in custody on June 21, 2003, just days before \nI received a letter from the Bush administration saying that our \nGovernment was in full compliance with the Torture Convention.\n\n[[Page S7234]]\n\n  Prisoners who are suspected of having killed or attempted to kill \nAmericans do not deserve comforts. But the use of torture undermines \nour global efforts against terrorism and is beneath a great Nation.\n  It is illegal whether U.S. personnel engage in such conduct \nthemselves or they hand over prisoners to the government agents of \nanother country where torture is commonly used. That happened in 2002, \nwhen U.S. agents sent a Canadian citizen to Syria, letting others do \nthe dirty work. Yet the White House will not provide us with the \ndocuments in which they concoct theories to justify turning over \ndetainees to foreign nations that conduct torture.\n\n  There are many victims of this policy. First are the Iraqis, Afghans, \nand other detainees, some of them innocent of any crime, who were \ntortured or subjected to cruel and degrading treatment. The \nInternational Committee of the Red Cross reported that it was told by \nthe U.S.-run Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq that 70 to 90 \npercent of those in detention were innocent civilians who had been \nswept up in raids.\n  That was information that U.S. officials gave to the ICRC. It came \nfrom our own Government. It is no wonder that after the horrific images \nwere broadcast around the world, the Pentagon started to clean out Abu \nGhraib, releasing thousands of prisoners who apparently never should \nhave been there.\n  We now know that many other Iraqis and Afghans died in U.S. custody, \nin conditions so abhorrent they conjure up images reminiscent of a \nCharles Dickens novel. Many of those deaths were never investigated.\n  The other victims of this policy are our own soldiers, who \noverwhelmingly perform their duties with honor and courage, and who now \nhave been unfairly tarnished and endangered by these images and this \nscandal.\n  Our troops have also been tarnished by profiteering companies, none \nmore brazen than Halliburton, which have reaped huge profits while our \nsoldiers are risking their lives and losing their lives. Yet \nRepublicans blocked Senate action to make war profiteering a crime and \nhold these people accountable.\n  Countless people around the world, especially in the Middle East, \nsuspected that President Bush's decision to invade Iraq had a lot more \nto do with Iraqi oil than with any of the other reasons he gave that \nhave since been proven false.\n  I do not share that view, but what better evidence to fuel those \ncharges than Halliburton's noncompetitive contracts and waste. It is \nfraud and abuse on a scale that would shock the conscience of anyone \nexcept perhaps an Enron executive. Halliburton seems to regard the U.S. \nTreasury as its own personal bank account. With ``cost plus'' \ncontracts, what do they care how much they overcharge the taxpayers? \nThey are guaranteed their profits regardless. It is the antithesis of \npatriotism.\n  And then there is America itself. Our Bill of Rights was the model \nfor the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Generations of Americans \nhave tried to live up to its promise and to set an example for the \nworld. The damage this administration has caused to our credibility and \nreputation as a nation of laws and of decency will take years to \nrepair. Just as they have squandered so much of the world's respect and \nsupport for our country after September 11, so now have they squandered \nmuch of the human rights leadership that has taken so many years to \npainstakingly build. This is a travesty of monumental proportions.\n  The individuals who committed those acts are being punished, as they \nmust be. But what of those who gave the orders or set the tone or \nlooked the other way? What of the White House and Pentagon lawyers who \ntried to justify the use of torture in their legal arguments? These \nlawyers have twisted the law, advising the President that for an abuse \nto rise to the level of torture it must go on for months or even years, \nand be so severe as to generate the type of pain that would result from \norgan failure or even death.\n\n  Think about that, and you begin to realize how destructive and \noutrageous this is.\n  And what of the President? Last March, referring to the capture of \nU.S. soldiers by Iraqi forces, President Bush said, ``We expect them to \nbe treated humanely, just like we'll treat any prisoner of theirs that \nwe capture humanely. If not, the people who mistreat the prisoners will \nbe treated as war criminals.''\n  At the same time, the President's own lawyer, ignoring the Torture \nConvention altogether, called the Geneva Conventions ``quaint'' and \n``obsolete.'' Today, soldiers who have spoken out about the crimes they \nwitnessed and the involvement of their superiors have been threatened \nand punished by the Defense Department they have honorably served.\n  One need only review history to understand why the law makes no \nexception for torture. The torture of criminal suspects flagrantly \nviolates the presumption of innocence on which our criminal \njurisprudence is based, and confessions extracted through torture are \nnotoriously unreliable.\n  Once exceptions are made for torture it is impossible to draw the \nline, and more troubling is who would be in charge of drawing it. If \ntorture is justified in Afghanistan, why is it not justified in China, \nor Syria, or Argentina, or Miami?\n  If torture is justified to obtain information from a suspected \nterrorist, why not from his wife or children, or from his friends or \nacquaintances who might know of his activities or his whereabouts? This \nhas happened in many countries, and decades later those societies are \nstill trying to recover.\n  The United States cannot become the model of justice our forefathers \nenvisioned if we continue to tolerate the twisted logic that has been \ngiven currency with increasing regularity in U.S. military prisons and \nin the White House since 9/11. Some argue it is a new world since those \nterrible attacks on our country 3 years ago. And to some degree, they \nare right, which is why we have reacted with tougher laws and better \ntools to fight this war. But do we really want to usher in a new world \nthat justifies inhumane, immoral and cruel treatment as any means to an \nend?\n  As a nation of laws, and as the world's oldest democracy and champion \nof human rights, we must categorically reject the dangerous notion that \nis now in our midst, seeking our assent, or our silence, that torture \ncan be legally justified and normalized.\n  President Bush has said he wants the whole truth, but he and his \nadministration have been stonewalling from the top. The President must \norder all relevant agencies to release the memos from which these \npolicies were devised.\n  He must clearly and unequivocally order all of his subordinates and \nevery member of our armed services to adhere to our international \ntreaty obligations including the Geneva Conventions, the Torture \nConvention, and all applicable U.S. laws. And finally, there needs to \nbe a thorough, independent investigation of the actions of those \ninvolved, from the people who committed abuses, to the officials who \nset these policies in motion.\n  Only when these actions are taken will we begin to heal the damage \nthat has been done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The Senator from Texas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/23/senate-section/article/S7234-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7234-S7242]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            INVESTIGATION INTO TREATMENT OF IRAQI PRISONERS\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I want to take a few minutes to respond \nto some of the comments made by the Senator from Vermont because I do \nthink the characterization he gave to some of what has gone on is at \nleast incomplete. I disagree with some of his conclusions, and I want \nto point out why because I believe the Members of this body deserve to \nhave a complete picture and at least have the benefit of considering \nalternative conclusions from those drawn by the Senator from Vermont.\n  I have the high honor of serving on both the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee and the Judiciary Committee. Certainly, the Senator from \nVermont is the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, but I would \nremind this body that the Senate Armed Services Committee, under the \nleadership of our chairman, has been investigating the Abu Ghraib \nprison situation and the interrogation practices and policies of the \nU.S. Government since at least May 11. We have had a series of hearings \nthere which have been very helpful\n\n[[Page S7235]]\n\nin understanding both the nature of the problem and the nature of the \ninvestigation that is ongoing, ultimately, hopefully, leading up to a \nconclusion as to who did what, whether there were, indeed, as there \nappears to be, some violations of American policy with regard to the \ninterrogation of detainees, and, of course, to hold the guilty \naccountable.\n  That is what we are: We are a nation of laws. We believe in the rule \nof law. We believe the law applies equally to everyone, no matter how \nhigh up in the chain of command you are or how low you are in the chain \nof command. And I believe we will be true to our ideals in that regard. \nBut I would say that much of what the Senator from Vermont has \nsuggested needs to be produced is sort of in a vacuum of sorts, without \nthe benefit of a lot of what the Senate Armed Services Committee has \nalready done, to find out what happened, what the policies were, what \nthe circumstances were, whether this represents an aberration or \nwhether it represents something worse.\n\n  To date I would say it is pretty clear that what we saw, as a result \nof a handful of actions on behalf of American soldiers, was an \naberration. And thank goodness. There is no question, though, that \nthese soldiers lacked the proper training and, indeed, the proper \nleadership. Those are chain of command problems and ought to be taken \nas high as they go as a result of the investigation.\n  But as the Presiding Officer knows, there are at least six different \ninvestigations into the circumstances at the Abu Ghraib prison. We need \nto let that process run its course to find out what the facts and \ncircumstances are. As I recall, we are awaiting the report of General \nFay and perhaps others. We ought to get to the facts and not succumb to \nthe temptation during an election year to overly politicize what is \ngoing on.\n  While we have always respected the rights and the civil liberties of \nevery American, we also need to be concerned about the rights and the \nhealth and the welfare of our young men and women who are serving our \nNation so nobly in the battlefield. That requires the ability to get \ngood, actionable intelligence.\n  The present occupant of the Chair was there at the Senate Armed \nServices Committee hearing. General Jeffrey Miller testified on May 19. \nI asked him at that hearing:\n\n       In your opinion, General Miller, is the military \n     intelligence that you've been able to gain from those who \n     have recruited, financed, and carried out terrorist \n     activities against the United States or our military, has \n     that intelligence you gained saved American lives?\n\n  General Miller said:\n\n       Senator, absolutely.\n\n  Then I asked General Abizaid, the CENTCOM commander:\n\n       And would you confirm for us, General Abizaid, that that's \n     also true within the Central Command?\n\n  And General Abizaid--who I think all of us, as we have come to know \nmore about him, have come to admire him and his leadership capacity--\nsaid forthrightly:\n\n       Senator, I agree, that's true. I would also like to add \n     that some of these people that we are dealing with are some \n     of the most despicable characters you could ever imagine. \n     They spend every waking moment trying to figure out how to \n     deliver a weapon of mass destruction into the middle of our \n     country. And we should not kid ourselves about what they are \n     capable of doing to us. And we have to deal with them.\n\n  It is very important to keep in proper context what is going on and \nthe fact that we are at war, a war not of our choosing--of course, we \nwere attacked--but a war that we must and we will finish.\n  I want to point out another thing that is important to the overall \ncontext of what the Leahy amendment seeks to get. That is, we have two \ncases currently pending at the U.S. Supreme Court in the Hamdi and the \nPadilla cases, where the U.S. Supreme Court will tell all of us in \nAmerica what the law requires with regard to the treatment of unlawful \ncombatants, including one who happens to be an American citizen, Jose \nPadilla, but who joined arms with the enemy, with the terrorists who \nseek to attack and to kill Americans on our own soil. And that advice, \nthat direction is forthcoming. It could literally come down, of course, \nany day now, since the Supreme Court's term is about to expire.\n\n  The characterization my colleague from Vermont gave to these \nmemoranda is not accurate. As a matter of fact, as the Senator may \nrecall--and maybe he said this; I didn't hear it--the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee voted against issuing a subpoena but then authorized the \nchairman and perhaps the ranking member to engage in discussions with \nboth Alberto Gonzales, White House counsel, and Attorney General \nAshcroft to determine what legal memoranda they might be willing to \nvoluntarily provide the committee. So we voted against issuance of the \nsubpoena.\n  But whether it is the Bybee memo that has been discussed and covered \nby so much of the press, that is 50 pages long, or whether it is any of \nthe other memos the Department of Defense and Department of Justice \nreleased yesterday, they reveal not a coverup but a careful, \ndeliberate, and scholarly approach to determining what, in fact, the \nlaw requires.\n  If, in fact, as the folks who are suggesting there is some sort of \ncoverup or some sort of policy of abuse--either one of direction or in \nterms of creating an atmosphere where it should happen--these memos \nthat have been released completely refute that idea of lawlessness that \nthey are seeking to spin.\n  I am deeply disturbed by the increasingly politicized nature of the \ndebate on the war on terror. We are at war against a people who will \nstop at nothing to kill innocent Americans. We paid the price for not \naggressively pursuing those terrorists and this information in the \npast, at least since 1993, with the bombing of the World Trade Center. \nBut after 9/11, our Nation found itself at war with a new kind of enemy \nfrom whom we need information, actionable intelligence, that can mean \nthe difference between life and death for our troops and our citizens.\n  As I said a moment ago, there have been many baseless allegations \nthat the Department of Defense has used torture during interrogations \nas a matter of policy. But what happened at Abu Ghraib was not an \nadministration policy, not DOD policy, not CENTCOM policy, or any other \nofficial policy. It was completely beyond the pale of acceptable \nbehavior, and those responsible will be held to account and will be \npunished.\n  As recently as yesterday, President Bush made the following comments:\n\n       We do not condone torture. I have never ordered torture. I \n     will never order torture. The values of this country are such \n     that torture is not a part of our soul and our being.\n\n  Yet despite these unequivocal comments from the Commander in Chief, \npolitical opponents of this administration continue to allege, without \nfoundation, that our Nation's leaders somehow support the use of \ntorture. It is important to remind some of our colleagues that, again, \nthe purpose of these interrogations is to gather intelligence \nconsistent with our values, which means no torture and humane treatment \nof all detainees. The interrogations we have conducted in Iraq and at \nGuantanamo Bay have saved American lives. I believe it is critical that \nwe continue to aggressively, within the limits of the law and humane \ntreatment, seek actionable intelligence and continue to save American \nlives.\n  Unfortunately, it seems there is an irresistible impulse to score \ncheap political points by criticizing the careful, deliberative process \nthe administration undertook to ensure that those very important \ninterrogations were conducted within the law. The techniques of our \nArmed Forces, including those used in Iraq or at Guantanamo Bay, can \nhardly be described as torture.\n  I, like a number of other Members, have traveled to Guantanamo Bay to \nobserve for myself, because I was concerned. I was interested. I wanted \nto learn how we are handling these people who have recruited, trained, \nand financed terrorist activity against the United States and, if given \nthe opportunity to do so, would do so again.\n  For some reason, there are certain Members, and indeed certain \nelements of the press, who are trying to convince the American public \nthat making a suspected terrorist stand for 4 hours, or giving them \nonly 4 hours of sleep constitutes torture. They want them to believe \nthat poking someone in the chest with a finger or changing their sleep \npatterns or meal selection is cruel or inhumane.\n\n[[Page S7236]]\n\n  Let me read quickly some of the approved methods of interrogation \nwhich some of the critics claim is torture: Asking straightforward \nquestions; incentive/removal of incentive; emotional love, which is \nplaying on the love a detainee has for an individual or group; playing \non the hatred an individual has for a individual or group; something \ncalled fear up harsh; fear up mild; reduced fear; pride up and ego up; \npride and ego down; futility, which is invoking the feeling of futility \nof a detainee; the we-know-all technique, convincing the detainee that \nthe interrogator knows the answers to the questions he is asking the \ndetainee; establish your identity, or convincing the detainee the \ninterrogator has mistaken the detainee for someone else; repetition \napproach; file and dossier, or convincing the detainee the interrogator \nhas a damning and inaccurate file, which must be fixed; rapid fire \nquestions; silence; change of scenery down; dietary manipulation.\n  For example, it says in this approved memorandum, a change from hot \nrations to MREs. That is hardly something that could be said to \nconstitute torture.\n  Next is environmental manipulation, or adjusting the environment to \ncreate moderate discomfort; sleep adjustment; false flag; and \nisolation.\n  These are not torture under anybody's definition. These are legal and \nhumane methods of extracting information from terrorists.\n  It is an affront to our men and women in uniform to accuse them of \ntorturing terrorists when the reality is our policy calls for all \ndetainees to be treated humanely. The time has come to ask at what \npoint does this largely partisan and media-driven witch hunt so damage \nand detract from the mission of our troops in the field that it \nirreparably harms U.S. interests, including our ability to collect \nlife-saving intelligence?\n  Because of the onslaught by some on Capitol Hill--a fact not lost \nupon our enemy--agencies have been forced to disclose procedures al-\nQaida and other terrorists now train and use to defend against, which \nis creating a roadmap.\n  Plain and simple, interrogations save lives. The interrogations we \nhave conducted over the past 2\\1/2\\ years have saved lives of soldiers \nin the field and innocent civilians at home. It is high time we get our \npriorities straight.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I am happy to respond to my colleague \nfrom Texas about an issue which is in this morning's paper and on the \nminds of many Americans and people around the world. In today's \nWashington Post, there are two major front-page stories related in an \nunusual way. Here is the photo of the parents of the South Korean who \nwas beheaded in Iraq--another heinous, barbaric crime committed by \nterrorist extremists. Next to it, we have an article entitled ``Memo on \nInterrogation Tactics Is Disavowed.''\n  In this article about the interrogation tactics we learn President \nBush's White House is now disavowing an opinion from the Department of \nJustice issued in August of 2002 relative to interrogation tactics that \ncould be used by the U.S. Armed Forces. It appears now that this memo \nhas become public, the White House has found it necessary to publicly \ndisavow this statement by the Department of Justice and Attorney \nGeneral Ashcroft. Why?\n  Well, I think it is obvious.\n  For a lengthy period of time the Bush administration and the \nDepartment of Justice of Attorney General Ashcroft have been involved \nin a fierce, protracted debate about acceptable interrogation \ntechniques and the definition of torture, a debate which relates to \nissues resolved over a hundred years ago, in many cases, by the \nGovernment of the United States of America when we made it our express \npolicy to disavow torture. When we later entered into a Geneva \nconvention after the Nazi war crimes, when we later had a convention on \ntorture, brought to Congress by President Ronald Reagan, this series of \ntreaties enacted by the United States making them the law of the land \nsaid we as a Nation stood with civilized nations around the world in \ncondemning and prohibiting torture, cruel and inhumane and degrading \ntreatment of prisoners. Our statements were unequivocal. We stated that \nfor the world.\n  Why? Frankly, because we believed the United States of America and \nthe values we represent on the floor of the Senate are different than \nsome. There may be some in this country who will argue we should answer \nthe beheading of innocent people, like this South Korean, with similar \nviolence. Thank God, their voices are few and ignored by most. We have \nsaid from the beginning we will not stoop to this level.\n  If there is anybody who believes that is acceptable conduct, it is \nnot the United States of America. That is a statement of values and \nprinciples, made first by President Abraham Lincoln during the bloody \nCivil War, and by Presidents of both political parties for decades \nthereafter. We know, however, that this administration, once engaged in \nthe war on terror, decided to engage in a new debate on the definition \nof torture.\n  Two weeks ago, the Attorney General of the United States came to the \nSenate Judiciary Committee and said to us unequivocally twice that it \nwas not his job, nor the job of this administration, to define torture. \nHe said that on the record. It was broadcast across America and around \nthe world. The very moment he said that, major news organizations were \nreleasing a memo from Attorney General Ashcroft's Department of \nJustice, which defied his statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee, \nthis memo of August 1, 2002, by Assistant Attorney General Bybee, a \nmemorandum sent to Alberto Gonzales, counsel to President George W. \nBush. According to Attorney General Ashcroft, this memo should not \nexist. He told us in open session it was not his job or the job of this \nadministration to define torture. He said Congress has done that, and \nthe laws do that.\n  Look at this memo of August 1, 2002. Turn to this infamous page 13 \nand read what Attorney General Ashcroft's Department of Justice said \nabout torture:\n\n       The victim must experience intense pain or suffering of the \n     kind that is equivalent to the pain that would be associated \n     with serious physical injury so severe that death, organ \n     failure, or permanent damage resulting in a loss of \n     significant body function will likely result.\n\n  You will not find these words in any treaty the United States has \nentered into, certainly not in our Constitution, nor in the laws of the \nland. You will find this in the memo from Attorney General Ashcroft's \nJustice Department. It is their definition of torture, sent to the \nPresident of the United States General Counsel, Mr. Gonzales.\n  For the Attorney General to tell us he is not in the business of \ndefining torture, frankly, doesn't square with the reality of this \nofficial memo from his own Department. If that were the only thing in \nthis memo, it would be bad enough. But there is more. Because in this \nmemo, you will find a rationalization to suggest that the President, as \nCommander in Chief, is not bound by the laws of the land. That is a \nstatement to which most people will say, I am sure they didn't say \nthat. Let me read to you from a section about Section 2340A, the \nstatute that makes torture a crime:\n\n       Any effort to apply Section 2340A in a manner that \n     interferes with the President's direction of such core war \n     matters as the detention and interrogation of enemy \n     combatants thus would be unconstitutional.\n\n  Sadly, it went further. I read from the same memo:\n\n       Section 2340A must be construed as not applying to \n     interrogations undertaken pursuant to his Commander in Chief \n     authority.\n\n  In other words, this memo from the Ashcroft Department of Justice to \nMr. Gonzales and the White House went beyond the definition of torture. \nIt created an escape hatch for this President to say, as Commander in \nChief: I am not bound by the laws of the land when it comes to torture \nand the interrogation of witnesses.\n  There are some who come to the floor and wonder why we are raising \nthis issue.\n  What is the importance of this issue? The importance of this issue \nwill be obvious to anyone who reads this memorandum now available on \nthe Internet. This administration engaged in a fierce and protracted \ndebate about whether they could redefine torture for the war on \nterrorism and whether this President, as Commander in Chief, was above \nthe law.\n\n[[Page S7237]]\n\n  For those of us in this Chamber who have sworn to uphold the \nConstitution of the United States, a solemn oath which each of us, \nincluding the President, must take, this is, indeed, an extremely \nserious situation: That this administration would think this President \nand those acting under his authority as Commander in Chief would not be \nbound by treaties, by the Constitution, or by the laws of the land.\n  Can any inquiry be more serious when the question, which must be \nasked by this Chamber of the Chief Executive of the United States, is \nwhether he has gone too far, violating the law of the land?\n  So what will come before us in a short time is an effort to say to \nAttorney General Ashcroft: It is not enough that we have to rely on \nleaked memos released on the Internet. We demand of you the disclosure \nof relevant documents which will give us a better picture and a better \nunderstanding of this debate within the Bush administration about \ntorture because, in the context of where we are today, this is not an \nacademic issue. Because of Abu Ghraib and the shameless conduct of the \nmen and women in that prison, which has been captured in photographs \nreleased around the world, the United States is being tested. We are \nbeing asked not only within our own borders, but around the world, \nwhether in the war on terrorism, we have abandoned a commitment of over \na century that says we will not engage in torture, that we are \ncommitted to the humane treatment of prisoners.\n  It is, unfortunately, a timely and legitimate question which we \ncannot duck; we cannot avoid. In order to answer that question, we \nunderstand we have to be open and transparent. We have to not only say \nto the world that we are the same country we were before 9/11. After \nAbu Ghraib, we have to show them proof, and the proof will be in the \ndocuments which the Attorney General has refused to disclose.\n  The Attorney General and the President have several legal options \nwhen Congress legitimately asks for documents. The President can assert \nhis executive privilege. That was done by President Nixon during the \nWatergate scandal. It was contested in court all the way to the Supreme \nCourt, but it is something a President can assert. Only the Court can \nultimately resolve the dispute then between Congress and the President. \nPresident Bush has not asserted executive privilege when it comes to \nthese memos of Attorney General Ashcroft. Or the Attorney General can \nsay: There is a statutory privilege that allows me to withhold these \ndocuments.\n  The request for information that we are going to put in amendment \nform allows classified material to be treated separately so it would \nnot in any way endanger the troops who are defending this country and \ndefending themselves in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  When asked point-blank by myself and others in the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, Attorney General Ashcroft said: I cannot give you a legal \nauthority for the reason I am not going to release these documents. He \nsaid: I just personally believe it is not the right thing to do.\n  I reminded the Attorney General--and it is worth repeating now--as \nimportant as his personal beliefs may be, they are not the law. If this \nDepartment of Justice and this Attorney General and this President \ncannot produce a legal reason for failing to disclose these documents, \nthen they are asking to be above the law. No President, no Attorney \nGeneral, no Senator, none of us serving this country or in this \nCongress are above the law and certainly not on an issue of this \nmagnitude.\n\n  Some critics have come to the floor and said this request by Members \nof the Senate of the Attorney General to produce these important \ndocuments is the product of ``an irresistible impulse to score cheap \npolitical points.'' I quote a colleague of mine who said those words \njust moments ago, ``cheap political points.''\n  I remind my colleagues and all others, this White House, just \nyesterday, decided this memorandum from Attorney General Ashcroft is so \nbad, so wrong that they are now disavowing the very memo which was sent \nto the chief counsel at the White House almost 2 years ago.\n  This is not about some political exercise. This is about truth and \ntransparency and a disclosure which is needed to restore the confidence \nin the core values of America not only for the American people but for \npeople around the world.\n  Yesterday, in a transparent effort to stop the pressure for full \ndisclosure, the administration provided Congress with a two-inch stack \nof documents. But a cursory review of these documents reveals that the \nadministration is withholding a lot of crucial information.\n  If anything, the documents that were released yesterday make it even \nmore clear that we need complete disclosure from the administration. As \nthe Chicago Tribune reported today:\n\n       The memos left unanswered at least as many questions as \n     they answered. White House officials acknowledged that the \n     documents provided only a partial record of the \n     administration's actions concerning treatment of prisoners.\n\n  What do the documents that were released show? We now know that the \nJustice Department memo sent to Mr. Gonzales was the basis for the \nDefense Department's decision to approve the use of coercive \ninterrogation techniques at Guantanamo Bay.\n  The Department of Defense and the Department of Justice were asking \nquestions which are almost impossible for me to articulate on the floor \nof the Senate, but I must. They asked: How far can our interrogators go \nbefore they may be charged with a war crime? How far can they go before \nthey might face a war crime tribunal?\n  That is the serious nature of this internal debate within the \nDepartment of Defense and the Department of Justice. That debate went \non before Abu Ghraib. That debate went on before those horrendous \nphotographs became part of the history of our occupation of Iraq.\n  Is it any wonder that Members of the Senate are coming to the floor \ntoday and saying we have an obligation to require this administration \nto completely disclose all of the documents and be open and honest \nabout the dialogue which went on between the White House and the \nagencies of our Government?\n  To do less, sadly, is to create a question, an unanswered question, \nabout whether the United States has changed.\n  Let me tell you for a moment some of the issues at hand. One of my \ncolleagues came to the floor and dismissed some of the criticism of \ninterrogation tactics as he said, frankly, tying the hands of \ninterrogators who are only trying to protect us. We have learned \nsomething about interrogation tactics. We have learned that if you use \ntorture--physical and mental torture--the person being interrogated \nwill say almost anything, truthful or not, to make it stop.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 15 minutes in morning business \nhas expired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask for 3 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. We know torture and the types of treatment, techniques, \nand interrogation tactics which have been prohibited by law in this \ncountry for many years are counterproductive. The Attorney General said \nas much before us. Torture does not work. People will lie for the pain \nto stop, and that is one of the reasons we do not engage in torture.\n  Secondly, my colleague, Senator Biden of Delaware, made a point and \nmade it clearly. He said, in his words: The reason the United States \ndoes not engage in torture is to protect Senator Biden's son, who is a \nmember of the military, and other members of the military from being \nsubjected to torture.\n  We establish standards of humane and civilized conduct not only for \nourselves but to demand them of the rest of the world. Will there be \nterrorists who ignore them? Of course. But who will argue with 140,000 \nAmerican lives on the line in Iraq that we should somehow stoop to \ninhumane and barbaric conduct in this war against terrorism, subjecting \nall of our soldiers and many other innocent Americans to the same \npossibility? We have rejected that, and we should continue to reject \nthat.\n  I close by saying this is a very serious issue for our Nation. The \nworld is indeed watching us. They are asking us whether the United \nStates will stand\n\n[[Page S7238]]\n\nbehind its treaties in the age of terrorism. The Senate has an \nobligation to the Constitution and to the American people to answer \nthese questions. Those who vote to table this amendment want to keep \nthis conversation muted and these memoranda hidden from the American \npeople. That is wrong. That is wrong for this government or any \ngovernment. The American people have the right to know in what their \ngovernment is involved. Transparency is critically important.\n  I urge my colleagues, and I hope a few of my Republican colleagues \nwill join those of us on this side of the aisle, to stand up for the \nrule of law, a rule of law which has guided Presidents from Abraham \nLincoln's time in the Civil War through President Reagan, through every \nPresident. There is no reason this President should be treated \ndifferently.\n  When it is offered, I urge my colleagues to support the Leahy \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to speak for \nup to 10 minutes, the Senator from New York be permitted to speak for \n10 minutes, and then the distinguished Senator from Alabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I have been listening to my dear colleague from Illinois, \nand I have to say what happened at Abu Ghraib was absolutely wrong. \nEverybody knows that. What happened there has to be decried. We all \nhave to speak out about it. But the minute they found out about it, \nthey started the process of prosecuting the people who did this. It \nappeared to be a small cadre of people, all of whom will likely receive \neither severe reprimands or actual prosecution. In other words, the \nsystem is working.\n  It should never have happened. We decry it. It was wrong. All the \nscreaming in the world by either side on this floor is not going to \nmake any difference. It happened, and we are all ashamed of it.\n  Having said that, if we listen to the arguments of the other side, \ntransparency is absolutely critical in all the things we do. Well, then \nthat means we ought to do away with the Intelligence Committee because \nthere are a lot of things that are not transparent to the American \npeople, especially when it involves national security, especially when \nit involves our young people's lives while overseas, especially when it \ninvolves all kinds of matters that are better left non-transparent.\n  I went on the Internet and I read every one of these documents that \nwas on the Internet. Most all of them were legal opinions. Now, one \nmight differ with legal opinions. I do not know any two lawyers who \nagree on everything anyway, but if one reads those opinions they do \nmake sense. For somebody to say carte blanche that the Geneva \nConventions apply and should apply to everything, that flies in the \nface of not only international law, it flies in the face of what is \nhappening in this situation.\n  This is not a normal situation. We are not fighting autonomous \ncountries right now. We are not fighting against organized enemies who \nwear uniforms and fight conventional battles. We are not fighting the \nnormal course of battles that we have had through the years where we \nhave had to, as gentlemen, recognize the civil way of doing things. We \nare fighting absolute terrorists who would destroy this country and \ndestroy every person involved in our overseas operations if they had a \nchance, and they would do it by any means possible: biological, \nchemical, weapons of mass destruction, nuclear, if necessary, if they \nhad the capacity to do it.\n  If we are so transparent that we tell them everything that is on our \nminds, then we are putting our young people at risk.\n  Yes, my colleagues can find fault with the legal opinions. People do. \nI might even agree or disagree on some of these legal opinions. But \nthey were well-reasoned opinions. I know some of the people who \nactually rendered them. They are top notch authorities in these areas. \nMy colleagues might disagree with them, but they cannot necessarily \nrefute them.\n  I was in Guantanamo a few weeks ago. I went completely through that \ncamp. I was shown everything I wanted to see, and that meant just about \neverything. I have read article after article about how terrible it is \nat Guantanamo, how much they violated the law, all because of \nconjecture. I have seen our colleagues on the other side, and I have \nseen the media excoriate this administration because of all of these \nbad things that have happened at Guantanamo.\n  Well, I went through Guantanamo, and it is a well-run camp with \nincentives. Now, some of our colleagues do not even like incentives. \nThey will even criticize that because it is the Bush administration, \nafter all. Of course, I know our colleagues are not making this kind of \ncriticism because they want to find fault with the Bush administration \nor cast blame on the Bush administration or make the Bush \nadministration look as if maybe it is not doing everything it should. I \nknow that could not possibly be in their minds. Or that they are \npoliticizing this because of the election that is going on. I know they \nwould not do a thing like that. I just know it. I just know it deep \nwithin my soul.\n\n  My colleagues can differ with the legal opinions and they can \ncertainly condemn what happened at Abu Ghraib. But these things are not \nhappening at Guantanamo Bay. They did happen in Afghanistan, but in \nthose cases there are investigations and prosecutions on their way. I \ndo not think we have to be transparent about everything around here. \nTransparency hurts our young men and women, too. It subjects them to \nall kinds of ridiculous problems.\n  It is important for us to get to the bottom of these things. I think \nit is important for us to have an overview, but I also think it is \nimportant for us to be fair and not just try to score, yes, cheap \npolitical points. Unfortunately, there is too much of that around here. \nIt has happened on both sides from time to time, but it has really been \nhappening this year. Every time it happens, I suggest we ought to stop \nand think about our young men and women overseas, whether we are \nhelping them or hurting them. Some of these arguments are hurting them.\n  When I went to Guantanamo, I watched two interrogations, one with a \nterrorist who was very uncooperative and another one who at first was \nvery uncooperative but because of work by some very effective people, \nusing very effective interrogation techniques--not torture, by the way, \nnot even close to torture--they have been able to obtain information \nthat has saved our boys' and girls' lives.\n  Interrogations have to go on and they are not patty-cake games. There \nis no excuse for anything that even comes close to torture. And I \nbelieve that other than isolated incidents--which are going to happen \nin times of war, especially when we are fighting these type of \nterrorists--I suggest that our people have abided by the Geneva \nConventions even though it is correct to say that in this type of a \nsituation the Geneva Conventions may not apply.\n  Personally, I believe we ought to apply them to everything because \nthere is a wide variety of interrogation techniques that are \npermissible under the Geneva Conventions. I won't go through all of \nthose because I don't want to be transparent. Nor do I want some \ntechniques that are acceptable to be criticized by any colleagues from \nany side to score cheap political points.\n  Frankly, I am getting a little tired of this desire to undermine \neverything that is going on over in Iraq and Afghanistan. I think it is \ntime for us to get together and work in unison to try to help our young \nmen and women. Transparency sometimes happens to be the worst thing we \ncan do.\n  That doesn't mean we should not get to the bottom of these awful \nthings that have happened at Abu Ghraib. That doesn't mean we should \ntolerate that type of irresponsible and criminal conduct. Of course we \nshould not. There is nobody in this body who disagrees on that, to my \nknowledge; nobody. But to try to imply that the President of the United \nStates is responsible for these aberrational activities by a few is, I \nthink, irresponsible in and of itself and I think it is just too much \nof this political world that we are in right now.\n  Madam President, I went through the camp itself down at Guantanamo. \nIt\n\n[[Page S7239]]\n\nwas well run. There were people there who never were fed so well in \ntheir lives. There were arrows, so they could pray in the correct \ndirection. There were Korans in every cell as far as I could see.\n  I saw many chessboards and checkerboards. I saw outdoor areas where \nthey could exercise. I saw a lot of things that were being done right. \nI saw interrogations that were not staged for me, and I have to tell \nyou it was run right. Anybody who thinks these are patty-cake games, \nthat we must really hold and pet their hands, just isn't living in the \nreal world.\n  I agree and I concede and I hope our colleagues--everybody on both \nsides agree there are certain things you can do within the parameters \nof the Geneva Conventions and there are certain things you can't do. \nBut I guarantee if you went through everything that can be done in the \nGeneva Conventions there would be some people who would be very upset \nthat those types of interrogation techniques could be used. I am not \ngoing to go through them all because I know the more stressful ones \nwere not being used with the authority of our people. I think to imply \nthat they were is wrong.\n  Before I close, let me just take a moment to comment briefly on \nstatements made by my Democratic colleagues, attacking the President \nand the administration for not being forthcoming in releasing \ndocuments, notwithstanding the fact that they just declassified and \nreleased approximately 260 pages of legal memoranda.\n  They attack the Attorney General for refusing to hand over three \ndocuments when he testified before the Committee, but since then, we \nhave received those documents from the White House.\n  Now, even though they lost on this issue before the Judiciary \nCommittee, they are now trying to bring it up as an amendment on the \nfloor.\n  In fact, they want us to vote on a subpoena before the time set to \ncomply with the document request has passed. It is simply premature to \nissue any subpoena at this time.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment if the Senator \nfrom Nevada decides to reintroduce it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from New \nYork is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I thank my colleagues for this debate. \nThe bottom line here to me is simple. That is, I must disagree with my \ngood friend from Utah. I think transparency is to be preferred. Maybe \nit should not be in all instances but that ought to be the presumption \nand there ought to be strong argument before any transparency is not \ndone.\n  Why is transparency important? I will tell you why: Because it makes \nbetter law. It makes better rules. The whole foundation of our \nGovernment has been based on openness--open debate, open discussion. \nWhen that happens, we end up with better laws. Time and time again \nthroughout the over 200-year history of this Republic, when things are \ndone in secret, it leads to trouble.\n  This is a very delicate issue. There is no question about it. \nObviously, we are in a new world, in a new situation. I don't think \nabsolutes always govern in these kinds of situations. That is for sure. \nI am not sure exactly where the line is to be drawn. I don't think \nanyone is. But I am certain of one thing and that is you will draw the \nline a lot better when there is open debate and open discussion. After \nall, we are talking about the place where liberty and security clash.\n  The beauty of our system of government is that it is able to handle \nclashing values such as this in an extremely successful way, and has \nbeen almost certainly or almost universally for all the years of the \nRepublic. Particularly the Founding Fathers, who debated these issues \nover and over again, wanted transparency when they were debating. That \nis why there is separation of powers. That is one of the reasons the \nwhole system was set up with a legislative body and an executive \nbranch. If, indeed, the Founding Fathers thought this all should be \ndone in the executive branch behind closed doors, we would have had a \ntotally different system.\n  Yet what we have found in this Justice Department all too often, in \nthis administration all too often, when the vital issues of liberty \nversus security should be decided, there is an aversion to debate. \nThere is a preference for doing this in secret, in the dark, behind \nclosed doors. On issue after issue after issue, when that has been \ndone, a bad result occurred.\n  My colleague from Utah seems quite certain what happened at Abu \nGhraib and other places. He may be the only one in this Chamber who is. \nI don't know how far the chain of command went. I don't know which \nmemos exist and don't exist and what they say and which were \ndispositive. I have real doubts that it was the noncommissioned \nofficers at the bottom of the chain who were the only ones who had \nanything to do with this, but who knows? Who knows? We are not going to \nknow anything until we get these memos.\n  If they have things that should be classified, let those be redacted. \nIf there are certain things that would damage the security of our \nsoldiers, of our country, let those be redacted.\n  But I doubt even my colleague from Utah, who stated that no one in \nthis Chamber feels we should not have transparency and debate--I think \nwe mistake two things. There are the difficulties and practicalities of \nliving in this real world, this post-9/11 world, and I have spoken \nabout that at the hearing and everywhere else. There is the leap \nin logic, the incorrect logic, that says because those issues are \ndifficult they should be decided in the dark, in secret. The two don't \nfollow. In fact, I would argue the opposite follows. The more difficult \nthe issue, the more dangerous it is to either liberty or security or to \nboth, as in this case it may be, the more we need openness, the more we \nneed discussion.\n\n  Again, if this were the first time that this Justice Department had \ndecided to deal with terribly sensitive and difficult issues in secret \nI don't think there would be such a brouhaha in this Chamber or in the \ncountry. But it is a pattern that happens over and over and over again. \nOur Attorney General has come to testify before our Judiciary Committee \ntwice since his ascension to that high office. When we ask questions, \nwe routinely get no answer, or answers that do not deal with the \nquestions. There is almost a mistrust of open debate, a mistrust of the \nlegislative body, a mistrust that the American people ultimately in \ntheir wisdom will come to the right conclusion.\n  It is almost a sort of ``We know best we can't trust you to know \nanything'' type attitude. I am surprised to see so many of my \ncolleagues defending that attitude.\n  Again, let's not mistake where we come down on the substance of this \nissue, where there will be variation--my colleague from Illinois and my \ncolleague from Utah had different views--with the need for openness, \nthe need for transparency, the need for debate, and the faith that \ncertainly George Washington and Thomas Jefferson and James Madison and \nAlexander Hamilton had, that we should have as well, and that is that \nopen debate will lead to the right conclusion. That is democracy. It is \nfaith in the people and ultimately their ability to make the right \ndecisions after open, fair debate, after both sides are presented.\n  That faith has been sadly lacking by the Attorney General and, I \nregret to say, in good part by this administration. So we come tonight, \ntrying to force the issue. We believe we are living up to our \nconstitutional responsibilities. We believe that if the Founding \nFathers were looking down on this Chamber they would say: You are doing \nthe right thing to get these documents and make them public, to have an \nopen debate.\n  I hope and pray some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nwill see this.\n  When Attorney General Ashcroft came before our committee and didn't \nclaim executive privilege and didn't claim what he was talking about \nwas classified, but said he would refuse to answer the committee \nanyway, that is not what this Chamber is all about, or these hearings \nare all about, or this Government is all about. That is why when that \nhas happened in the past, there have been discussions of contempt of \nCongress. We wish to avoid those kinds of confrontations. We want to \ncome to an honest discussion.\n  Everyone will admit there were problems. My colleague from Utah said\n\n[[Page S7240]]\n\nthat. Well, do you think those problems were sui generis? I would argue \nthose problems could well have resulted because of a tendency for \nsecrecy, or because of the aversion to open debate. For all we know, \nthere were contradictory memos floating around the Department of \nJustice and floating around the Department of Defense. For all we know, \nmajors, captains, and colonels who had to interpret these things on the \nground were totally confused. We should find out all of this.\n  Again, to my colleagues, I hope we will agree to the Leahy amendment; \nI hope we will agree to the Reid amendment to the Leahy amendment; we \nwill get to the bottom of this and come up with a policy in this \ndifficult world and difficult position that is satisfactory, or at \nleast the best solution where there may be no solution that satisfies \neverybody.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Alabama is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I would like to comment on some of the things that have been said.\n  First of all, I believe there are things our country has every right \nto maintain secrecy on. I think the administration has been open about \nproducing memorandum to us in a way that I don't know they are required \nto do. I was a Federal attorney in the Department of Justice and a U.S. \nattorney for 12 years. I have some appreciation for the way the \nGovernment works. The President has a right to receive legal advice on \nall the options he may have from his Attorney General or staff \nattorneys. In fact, a lot of reference has been made here, and as far \nas I can tell, Attorney General Ashcroft's memoranda are memoranda \nwritten only by lower level attorneys, detailing the legal options \navailable in a time of war.\n  Certainly we want to encourage attorneys to consider these ideas and \nthese issues on what is appropriate in terms of interrogating prisoners \nwho are bent upon the destruction of the United States of America and \nas many of its citizens in this country as they can possibly kill. That \nis fact, and we know it. The rules of law and of war are a joke to the \nterrorists that we have captured and others still bent on attacking \nAmericans. They care nothing about it. They make television movies of \nbeheading people. That is what they think of the rules of law.\n  So what we need to do is decide what is appropriate and what laws we \nare bound by, and we ought to set a good policy there.\n  I would say this: The Senator from New York is a good lawyer. He has \nsaid in his own view that torture sometimes may be necessary. That is \nwhat Senator Schumer said.\n  I think any Attorney General should properly advise any President of \nthe United States in time of war on absolutely what the limits of his \npowers are. Those are things that maybe ought not be bandied around the \nworld. It is hypothetical. You don't know what the precise \ncircumstances are.\n\n  But the question that started all of this is abuses in prison in \nIraq. The memos at the center of this debate have absolutely no \nconnection--there is no connection--between what went on in Iraq and \nthese memos, because our soldiers were operating under established \npolicies of the military and internal discussions between the President \nand various lawyers, or memoranda they may have received from various \nlawyers.\n  I want to say this about Attorney General Ashcroft. I was at the \nJudiciary Committee hearing when he testified. I saw him subjected to \nunfair abuse by former colleagues on that committee which was \nembarrassing to the committee. I don't think I have ever seen in my \nexperience in this Congress the kind of disingenuous and unfair \ntreatment of a former Member of this body. It was not right. The \nranking member was using the whole time to make a litany of distortions \nand charges against the Attorney General where he had no opportunity to \nanswer them. He knew there was no way he could. It was not right. It \nwas wrong. I said that then, and I say it now. He had no opportunity to \nrespond to the ranking Member. Senator Leahy knew it, and said these \nthings one right after another: You did this, you did that. They \ncontinued in that vein.\n  The question here was, Oh, he wouldn't define torture, yet he had a \nmemorandum defining torture.\n  That is not what Attorney General Ashcroft said. Go back and read the \ntranscript. I saw what he said. Attorney General Ashcroft is a smart \nman, an honest man, and he answered the question directly. He said, \nSenator, the Congress defined torture. It is not for me to define \ntorture. You define torture. The Attorney General doesn't define \ntorture. I am not defining torture. The Congress has already defined \nit.\n  There is a statute. I have a copy of it here in which we defined it \nunder certain circumstances. We set out an anti-torture statute. That \nis what the Attorney General was referring to.\n  Then somebody with great demand said, We want these memos; you are \ngoing to give them right now. Are you giving them or not? The Attorney \nGeneral sat there in a nice, direct, soft way, and said, No, Senator, I \nam not giving you these right now. Are you claiming executive \nprivilege? He said, No, I am not claiming executive privilege.\n  These are memorandum submitted to the President of the United States. \nIt is the memorandum of his client. It is the President's memorandum. \nIt is not his to give. He can't go around giving out the confidential \ninformation he sent to the President of the United States about what he \ncan do during the conduct of a war. That is not right. He didn't do it. \nAnd he didn't back down on it. One of the Senators said, Well, this is \nimportant because I have a son in uniform. The Attorney General said, \nMy son has been in Iraq. He just got home, and he is going back to \nIraq. He is in uniform, too. I care about this issue.\n  I don't think what has been said is fair.\n  With regard to the amendment that is pending, I reject it. We need to \nvote it down. It is political. It is designed to embarrass this \nadministration politically, and it hurts us around the world. We are \nasked to cast a vote suggesting that this administration has not \nconducted itself in a proper way. The evidence does not show that.\n  I am on the Armed Services Committee as well as the Judiciary \nCommittee. We have had, I think, four hearings in Armed Services. We \nbrought back the top general. We had the Secretary of Defense, \nSecretary Rumsfeld. We had Secretary Wolfowitz, the Deputy Secretary. \nWe had General Abizaid and General Sanchez. We had General Taguba who \nwent over there and conducted the investigation and issued the report \non it.\n  I heard all of that evidence. None of them said, Well, we got a \nmemorandum from the Attorney General that the President of the United \nStates signed off and said we are supposed to torture prisoners, we are \nsupposed to carry them around, move them around and put hoods over \ntheir heads, and otherwise abuse them.\n  There is no evidence that was so. In fact, the military had a pretty \ngood series of policies about how to treat prisoners. Some said, some \nof them went too far. If some of them went too far, let's hear exactly \nwhat they say went too far and what was wrong. If we need to change \nthat policy, I am willing to discuss that. In fact, we are discussing \nthat at this very moment.\n\n  A number of the things that were so objectionable, none of the things \nthat happened in that prison, were in any way remotely connected to the \nmemorandums and directives and regulations issued by General Sanchez \nand the commanders in Iraq. In fact, all the memorandum said they \nshould follow Geneva Conventions in how they handle prisoners.\n  Some say we did not train them about the Geneva Conventions. Every \nAmerican soldier is trained about the Geneva Conventions. I was in the \nArmy Reserve for 10 years. I was a lawyer and U.S. attorney for some of \nthat time, and for a short period of time I was a JAG officer. I taught \na course on the Geneva Conventions. You had to sign a document saying \nyou briefed your soldiers every year on the Geneva Conventions.\n  Everyone knows you cannot torture prisoners, you cannot display them \nin sexual ways. Everyone knows that. Every private is taught that. \nEveryone up to the generals is taught that. It is\n\n[[Page S7241]]\n\nnot the way we are supposed to treat people. Certainly it was not \njustified and not the policy of the military. It never was the policy \nof the military. I don't appreciate the suggestion that this was the \npolicy of the military and that somehow the internal memorandums up in \nthe Department of Justice in Washington about hypotheticals and what \npowers the President might have somehow were carried out in the \nprisons. They had established policies.\n  I saw in the Washington Times today, quoting one of these memos, a \nmemo entitled ``Humane Treatment.'' That ought to make some people \naround here happy. It actually says ``Humane Treatment of Al-qaida and \nTaliban Detainees.'' That is a pretty good title for a memorandum. They \nare complaining about some military memorandum they did not like the \ntitle of, saying the title suggested something bad and within the \nmemorandum there were commands to preserve and protect the prisoners.\n  This title is a good title. President Bush says he accepts ``the \nlegal conclusion of the Attorney General and the Department of Justice \nthat I have the authority under the Constitution to suspend Geneva as \nbetween the United States and Afghanistan, but I decline to exercise \nthat authority.'' Of course, our values as a Nation call for us to \ntreat detainees humanely, including those who are not legally entitled \nto such treatment.\n  Now, what is all this about? Senator Hatch mentioned, as I believe \nSenator Cornyn did, and several years ago in the Judiciary Committee we \nhad a number of hearings right after September 11 on what the authority \nof the United States is with regard to treatment of prisoners and the \napplication of the Geneva Conventions. The Geneva Conventions do not \napply to unlawful combatants. It is that simple.\n  What is an unlawful combatant? It is a person who does not wear a \nuniform, who enters a country surreptitiously, who attacks civilians, \nand does not comply with the rules of war. Our enemies are supposed to \ncomply with the rules of war also. Unlawful combatants do not comply \nwith the rules of war. Al-Qaida does not. Most of the people in \nAfghanistan were not complying with the rules of war and the people who \nare bombing and killing in Iraq right now are not complying with the \nrules of war. All of them are unlawful combatants.\n  One of the reasons for the Geneva Conventions is to give protections \nto prisoners of war who were lawful combatants, to encourage people to \nbe lawful combatants and not to be unlawful combatants, not to be \nterrorists who sneak around and bomb people.\n  Has this ever been dealt with in America? Are we making this up? Is \nthis some idea the Senator from Alabama thinks is an idea that has \nnever been dealt with before? No. In the Judiciary Committee we had a \nhearing on it and discussed these issues in some detail not long after \nSeptember 11. We had testimony and read and debated the Ex parte Quirin \ncase. In Ex parte Quirin, the Nazis sent saboteurs into the United \nStates to bomb and kill and dismantle our civilian structure. That was \ntheir plan. They were Nazi saboteurs. They were not wearing German \nuniforms. They were not acting in a way consistent with the regular \nArmy. Their plan of attack was terrorist in nature. They were \napprehended.\n\n  The President of the United States, certainly a greatly respected \nPresident for our Democratic colleagues who are pushing this \nlegislation, President Franklin Roosevelt, was highly offended. He said \nwe are not going to give them a trial in Federal court. We are not \ngoing to try them with a jury in the United States of America. These \npeople are setting about to destroy our country, to kill our people, \nand to sabotage our civil infrastructure. They are going to be tried, \nas I have the power to do so, by a military commission. He so ordered \nit.\n  They were tried in the U.S. Department of Justice right down the \nstreet by a military commission. They did not have public trials. After \ncompletely trying the case and building a record and making findings of \nguilt, most of them were executed within weeks of their arrest. The \nvalidity of these trials were challenged and the case went to the \nSupreme Court of the United States. The Supreme Court affirmed the \nviews of the President. Some of these enemy combatants were given \nprobation and some of them who were tried that way were American \ncitizens.\n  Crimes were committed in the United States by American citizens, but \nthey were participating as unlawful combatants. They were tried by a \nmilitary tribunal. They were convicted. Most of them were executed. \nSome of them got lesser times and one or two who cooperated got out of \njail before too long. But all served a considerable amount of time and \nthe Supreme Court said that was appropriate. That was right.\n  The history of the military commission is strong. That is justice. \nMilitary commissions do justice. Military officers are people. They do \nnot want to convict innocent people, send innocent people to jail, or \ndo things that are wrong. They are empowered in combat to use deadly \nweapons on a whole host of people that could kill them.\n  President Truman, who followed President Roosevelt, dropped an atom \nbomb on two cities in Japan. The President of the United States does \nhave powers in wartime that are different from that kind of situation \nwhen somebody robs a bank down the street.\n  Fundamentally, what we are dealing with is how to deal with prisoners \nunder these circumstances. Some people say, a lot of people in this \ncountry say, they don't respect us, they don't respect law, they bomb \ninnocent civilians, women, men, children. They cut off people's heads \nand make a video of it and brag about it. But they are not entitled to \nany rights. They are not entitled to any rights. We just ought to go at \nthem and kill them, the sooner the better.\n\n  We have some in this body who say these terrorists are entitled to \nmore rights than the laws themselves give. In fact, they have insisted \non it. This resolution actually calls on the Government to give these \nterrorists and unlawful combatants more rights than they are entitled \nto under the law.\n  President Bush has said: I am going to comply with the Geneva \nConventions. We are going to treat these people humanely. That is the \nright position, I believe, and that is what he has done. We have given \nthem fair treatment.\n  I visited Guantanamo and saw how it was done down there early on. I \nbelieve they were treated very well. The reports that come out of there \ncontinue to show that.\n  We know we had a terrible problem in Abu Ghraib prison where, on a \nmidnight shift, a group of soldiers were out of control. Now we have a \ndesperate attempt by Members of this Senate to go around and say the \nabuses that occurred on that night were somehow the responsibility of \nthe Secretary of Defense, General Sanchez, General Abizaid, President \nBush, and John Ashcroft.\n  That is not true. It is wrong. It undermines our ability to lead in \nthe world. It does, I believe, place greater risk on our soldiers who, \nat this moment, are on the battlefield in Iraq because we sent them \nthere. We should not do that.\n  If you have legitimate complaints, let's have them, let's hear them \nin the Senate. But I do not believe we need to be suggesting there is a \npolicy of this Government to mistreat people as was done in Abu Ghraib \nprison in Iraq.\n  We had a distinguished senior Senator who said we had traded Saddam \nHussein's prisons for American prisons. What he meant by that was we \nwere treating prisoners just as Saddam Hussein did. That is wrong. It \nis a slander on the soldiers of the United States. It should not have \nbeen said. When that was said, it got headlines in the terrorist camps \nall over the world. It should not have been said. It is false.\n  Not long ago I had the opportunity to meet seven Iraqi individuals \nwho had had their hands chopped off in Saddam Hussein's prisons, with \nSaddam Hussein justice. We know of the thousands he had killed there--\nwithout trial, without any benefit of being able to put on a defense, \nand how he used, as a policy of his government, terror.\n  These kinds of dictators use random violence to terrorize a \npopulation to keep power. He did it systematically. This was one of the \nmost brutal dictators in the history of the world. He killed hundreds \nof thousands of people. There are maybe 300,000 graves in that country \nof people who were killed.\n  So it is wrong to say that. Why we keep pushing this, I do not know. \nI will\n\n[[Page S7242]]\n\njust say this: The Armed Services Committee--we have this bill on the \nfloor right now, and it has taken us too long, and it has caused us to \nnot be able to have the hearings we probably would have had--but we are \ngoing to have more hearings on what happened in Abu Ghraib prison. \nAlready people are being tried and convicted and sentenced for \nmisbehavior there. We are going to keep on, and the higher up it goes, \nthey are going to be followed.\n  I was a former prosecutor for some time, and I will ask anybody in \nthis body to tell me: If a soldier is charged with committing an abuse \non a prisoner, and he was ordered to do so, or there was some written \ndocument he was relying on to do this abuse, do you think he is not \ngoing to produce it? Do you think he is not going to say that in his \ndefense? Certainly, he will. So if there are any higher-ups involved in \nthis, it is going to come out.\n  But, frankly, I do not see the evidence that any higher-ups in the \nhigher echelons of the Government ever issued any orders in any way \nthat would have justified this. It did not happen at any time except on \na midnight shift by a few people, who videoed themselves, videoed \nthemselves in circumstances that would be very embarrassing to their \nmamas and daddies if they had seen it, I can tell you that, on their \nown behavior, much less what they were doing to the prisoners.\n\n  So I do not think it was a pattern. I do not think it was a policy. \nIn fact, all the evidence we have seen so far shows it was not. Within \n2 days of this information coming forward to the commanders in that \nregion, General Sanchez ordered an investigation. He suspended people. \nThe military announced publicly, in a public briefing in Iraq, that \nthey were conducting an investigation of abuses at Abu Ghraib prison.\n  They have continued those investigations. A number of people have \nbeen charged criminally by the military. A number of them have had \ntheir cases end with punishments being imposed, and others will have \nthem as time goes by. I would say, what more can you ask them to do? \nThey are cracking down. I do not appreciate resolutions such as this \nthat suggest it was a policy of the United States that this occurred, \nthat suggest that our American soldiers are the same as Saddam \nHussein's soldiers and prison guards--the way they treated their \nprisoners. It is not right. It is wrong. It should not be said, and it \nundermines the confidence that we ask the world and the Iraqis to have \nin our soldiers.\n  We believe they are going to do good work. We believe they are doing \ngood work. We know, when you have 100,000, 200,000 soldiers over there, \nsome of them will make mistakes. Just like any city in America that has \n200,000 citizens, 130,000 citizens, some of them are going to commit \ncrimes and make errors and do things wrong. They ought to be \ndisciplined. They ought to be held accountable. But we do not need to \nfire the mayor because somebody commits a crime on the streets of the \ncity.\n  Mr. President, I see the Senator from Arizona is in the Chamber, and \nI know he may well have comments to make on this or other issues.\n  I will conclude by saying this is not a good resolution. It has no \nbusiness here. It is contrary to what we ought to be doing.\n  We ought to be spending our time on how to help our military get a \nhandle on this problem in Abu Ghraib, and we ought to be spending our \ntime mostly on trying to help them be effective in dealing with, \ncapturing, and killing the terrorists who reject all rules of law, who \nreject all Geneva Conventions, who believe they have a legitimate right \nto advance their personal power agenda by killing innocent people \nwhenever and wherever they can.\n  I am most grateful that we have American soldiers this very moment \nfollowing the vote of this Congress and executing the policy we ask \nthem to execute in Iraq to further freedom and liberty around the \nworld.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/23/senate-section/article/S7242-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7242-S7243]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                EXEMPTIONS TO BILATERAL TRADE AGREEMENTS\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I am going to talk about an amendment which I \nwould have offered to the Defense authorization bill, but in the \ninterest of time and to ensure that we can move the bill forward and \ncomplete work on that bill this evening, I am not going to do so.\n  But I would like to discuss the general subject of the amendment, and \nbegin by complimenting the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, \nthe Senator from Virginia, on recognizing the very important necessity \nof changing our law to help work very closely with two of our greatest \nallies, the United Kingdom and Australia.\n  We transfer a lot of technology back and forth between these two \nimportant allies. It is important that we have the capability of doing \nthat. One of the amendments I believe will be adopted as part of this \nDefense authorization bill is a proposal of the distinguished chairman \nthat would provide an exemption from U.S. law which requires that a \nbilateral agreement covering a specified set of issues be negotiated in \norder for a country to obtain an export control waiver. The bilateral \nagreements between the United States and the United Kingdom and \nAustralia don't quite meet the standard set by U.S. law, so Congress \nneeds to grant an exemption for this. The chairman's amendment is very \nimportant in creating this possibility. I strongly associate myself \nwith that amendment.\n  Just a note or two about this relationship between the United Kingdom \nand Australia and the United States which illustrates why it is so \nimportant for us to have this kind of cooperation. I think everybody \nknows the United Kingdom is our strongest ally in the war on terror. In \naddition to the over 8,000 personnel they have provided for the \nmilitary operation, they support food aid. They have contributed a \ntremendous amount of money for reconstruction. Everyone is aware of \ntheir contribution. Perhaps less well known is the contribution that \nthe Australian defense force has made. They contributed about 2,000 of \ntheir personnel, including a squadron of FA-18s and special forces \nelements, two navy frigates. They have a full variety of operations \nthat I won't get into here. They have also been cooperative with us in \na lot of other areas such as missile defense programs, and so on.\n  It is for this reason that the chairman offered his proposal, which I \nam sure will become part of the Defense bill, that will make it easier \nfor us to transfer equipment that is important to defense between the \nUnited States and Great Britain and Australia.\n  The amendment I was going to offer simply added or would have added \nanother element to that. We won't do it in this bill. Perhaps in \nconference with the House or at some other point, we could do that.\n  It is an amendment that would make sure that in the transfer of \nimportant munitions between the United States and a country such as \nGreat Britain, they would never get into the wrong hands. That is to \nsay, they wouldn't be exported to a country that might potentially use \nthem against the United States. The reason it is a problem is that some \ncountries in Europe, for example, are talking about lifting the arms \nembargo that currently exists between those countries, the United \nStates, and China.\n  We do not send China our most sophisticated military equipment. There \nis a good reason for that. China has announced plans that it is \ndeveloping military equipment that could directly compete with the \nUnited States in military conflict. So, obviously, we don't want to \nhave a law on the books that would make it easy for a country such as \nChina to acquire military equipment that we share freely with our \nallies, such as Australia and the United Kingdom, but which we would \nnot want to go to a country such as China.\n  That is the reason for my concern about this retransfer issue. The \nnews reports have indicated, for example, that the United Kingdom might \nagree to support the lifting of the European Union's arms embargo \nagainst China. That would be an important event. What my amendment \nwould have done is simply said if the European Union were to lift its \narms embargo against China, then no U.S. military equipment could be \ntransferred to entities in the European Union unless the President \ncertified to Congress that there are binding assurances from those \nentities that our military equipment would\n\n[[Page S7243]]\n\nnot be transferred to China. That is a pretty reasonable proposition.\n\n  The State Department strongly opposes the European Union's lifting of \nthe arms embargo. Secretary of State Colin Powell said the following on \nMarch 1:\n\n       Regarding arms sales to China, I expressed concern that the \n     European Union might lift its arms embargo. We and the \n     European Union imposed prohibitions for the same reasons, \n     most especially China's serious human rights abuses, and we \n     believe that those reasons remain valid today.\n\n  It is this government's policy that the arms embargo remain in \neffect. We are talking about military arms now, not trade. We have a \nhuge amount of trade with China. We are not talking about that. We are \ntalking about limiting certain kinds of militarily useful equipment.\n  At a February hearing of the U.S.-China Economic Security Review \nCommission, the Deputy Assistant Secretary in the State Department for \nEast Asian and Pacific Affairs, Randy Shriver, also expressed U.S. \nopposition to the European Union's lifting of the embargo for three key \nreasons: the human rights reason, China's lax export control policies, \nand China's military buildup against Taiwan. Similar concerns have been \nput forth by Department of Defense officials.\n  While we don't like to talk about it, there has been a change in the \ndirection of the buildup of the Chinese military. They have changed \ntheir doctrine to a doctrine which explicitly is designed to be able to \ndefeat U.S. military assets. They are proliferating dangerous weapons \nand technologies to some of our potential adversaries--North Korea, as \none example.\n  The intelligence community produces a semiannual report on \nproliferation. The most recent report stated the following with respect \nto China:\n\n       We cannot rule out . . . some continued contacts [related \n     to assistance to unsafeguarded nuclear facilities] subsequent \n     to the pledge between Chinese entities and entities \n     associated with Pakistan's nuclear weapons program.\n       . . . Chinese entities continued to work with Pakistan and \n     Iran on ballistic missile-related projects during the first \n     half of 2003 . . . Chinese-entity ballistic missile \n     assistance helped Iran move toward its goal of becoming self-\n     sufficient in the production of ballistic missiles. In \n     addition, firms in China provided dual-use missile-related \n     items, raw materials, and/or assistance to several other \n     countries of proliferation concern--such as Iran, Libya, and \n     North Korea.\n       During the first half of 2003, China remained a primary \n     supplier of advanced and conventional weapons to both \n     Pakistan and Iran. Islamabad also continued to negotiate with \n     Beijing for China to build up to four frigates for Pakistan's \n     navy and develop FC-1 fighter aircraft.\n\n  China also continues to threaten democratic Taiwan and to prepare \nmilitarily for a conflict against not only Taiwan, but also against the \nUnited States, were U.S. military forces to come to the assistance of \nTaiwan directly.\n\n  According to one recent Washington Post article, the Chinese \nGovernment warned Taiwan's President Chen Shui-bian to pull back what \nhe called ``a dangerous lurch toward independence or face \ndestruction.''\n  The Defense Department's annual report to Congress on the military \npower of the People's Republic of China warned\n\n     . . . the focus of China's short and medium term conventional \n     modernization efforts has been to prepare for military \n     contingencies in the Taiwan Strait, to include scenarios \n     involving U.S. intervention.\n\n  According to a previous report, the U.S.-China Security Review \nCommission, now the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, \nChina's military was directed to have viable options to retake Taiwan \nby 2005 to 2007. Let me repeat: China's military was told to be \nprepared for conflict with Taiwan by next year.\n  The DOD report further comments on the impact of the EU lifting its \narms embargo stating:\n\n       Efforts under way to lift the European Union embargo on \n     China will provide additional opportunities to acquire \n     specific technologies from Western suppliers.\n\n  That is precisely the problem I think we have to come to grips with \nat some point. I am extraordinarily supportive of efforts to show \npolitical support for and, in fact, enhanced military cooperation with \nour allies, as the Warner amendment certainly does. But I also think we \nhave to look at the export control policies which might, were the \nEuropean Union to lift the arms embargo, allow material weapons \nimplications to reach a country such as China. We obviously cooperate \nwith China on matters of trade, for example. And it plays an important \nrole in the international community. But it is a country with 20 \nnuclear-tipped missiles capable of reaching the United States, and the \nPentagon projects that number will reach 30 by next year.\n  It is a country that has an announced policy that would be very \ndangerous if implemented with respect to Taiwan. So if the EU lifts its \narms embargo, European countries will have the capacity to willingly \npass military technology, and U.S. military technology, if we don't \nhave the proper transfer or retransfer protections in place to a \ncountry that presents a potential military threat to the United States.\n  My amendment would have prevented that from happening by simply \nsaying that no U.S. military equipment could be provided to countries \nin the European Union unless there is a Presidential certification that \nthere are binding assurances from such country that those goods won't \nbe transferred to China.\n  I don't think that is too much to ask. I think at some point we are \ngoing to have to include that within our law. The chairman of the \ncommittee has been very gracious in talking to me about working toward \nthat end. As I said, I think in view of the great importance of moving \nthis bill forward, completing action on it so we can provide the \nauthority for the Defense Department and the other forces necessary for \nthe next year, I am not going to offer my amendment. I certainly hope \nat an appropriate time we will be able to include the concept of what I \nam talking about in this Defense authorization bill.\n  I compliment the chairman for the work he has done, and I express my \nhope we can conclude this bill soon. We have been on it now for almost \na month, or half a month with respect to legislative days. I think it \nis time to come to an agreement on how to end debate and get it done. \nAfter all, we are in a war. We have to protect the American people and \nprovide for the men and women we have put into harm's way for that \npurpose.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank our distinguished colleague from \nArizona. He has been part of the team that has worked almost every day \nfor agreements on the floor, and in consultation on how to deal with \nthe various challenges we have had. He has been one of many who has \nmade it possible. I think we are making steady progress here. I thank \nthe Senator for the reference to the ITAR amendment, which I put in. I \nconsulted with him, Senator Biden, and a great many Senators who worked \nwith me in making this amendment possible, which is currently a part of \nthe managers' package and, I anticipate, will become part of the final \nbill. It is long overdue, as the Senator points out. But this amendment \nis sort of a keystone. I thank the Senator for adding that very \nimportant piece of legislative history to what I hope will be a \nstatutory provision that reflects the goals we both had in mind.\n  At this time, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I don't know the situation regarding this \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is in morning business.\n  Mr. WARNER. The bill is still actively being considered. There is a \npossibility we can achieve completion of the bill tonight. I remain of \nthat view.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, are we in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, we are in morning business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/23/senate-section/article/S7243-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7243-S7244]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have come to the floor because I am \nworried about the Defense appropriations bill. This bill that has been \nprepared by primarily Sid Ashworth and Charlie Houy of our Defense \nSubcommittee, under the direction of my cochairman Dan Inouye and \nmyself, was considered by the Subcommittee on Defense Appropriations \nand reported to the full committee in 17 minutes. We took it to the \nfull committee and we had a debate on that bill. It was reported to the \nfloor in 25 minutes.\n  The reason for that is, as we all know, there is in this bill an \namount of\n\n[[Page S7244]]\n\n$25 billion requested by the President for a reserve for Iraq and \nAfghanistan and the war on terror. We know if there is a development in \nIraq, in particular, which will give rise to a need for money, this \nbill must become law before we leave for the conventions in August, or \nreally late July, before the August recess.\n  Some of us in this body have served overseas, particularly in \nwartime. It was my privilege to do that in World War II. I was thinking \njust now about what is going on here on the floor, and how I used to \nfeel as a young man when we were told our supplies had not come over \nthe hump into China, that we were going to have to reduce our rations, \nmaybe live a little more on local food than on the food we brought into \nChina from a long distance from our country. I thought about the time \nColin Powell, as a young assistant to the then-head of the National \nSecurity Council, came before a Senate subcommittee on appropriations, \nand he told us at the time, when he was a young captain in Cambodia, he \nhad the duty to take out a whole Vietnamese battalion, and the U.S. \ntroops along with him had to go into Cambodia on a drop mission. They \nparachuted in. They were given a 2-week supply of food. He told us when \nyou get up on that 14th day and open up the last bit of your rations, \nthat is when you start thinking about the people who are in Washington \nthat you trust. That is when you start thinking about whether the \npeople who run the Government know what they are doing when they send \nyou into foreign countries, like Cambodia, in wartime.\n  As I speak now, there are men and women in the armed services in our \nU.S. uniform in 120 countries. Managing the Department of Defense is an \noverwhelming job right now. The money we are spending is enormous, but \nthe cause we are on is just. Whether you feel it is just or not, the \nproblem is, we now know that when we leave for the conventions, there \nis a great possibility the Department of Defense and Commander in Chief \nwill have to have more money available than is currently available in \nfiscal year 2004. Our committee, the Defense Appropriations \nSubcommittee, and the Appropriations Committee, has worked long hours \nto bring this bill before the Senate so we can pass it before we leave \non this recess for the Fourth of July, and be able to come back and be \nready to conference it, because staff conferences during the recess, \nand bring it back to the floor so both the House and the Senate can \npass the bill and get it to the President and have it become law before \nwe leave before the end of July.\n\n  I hear a lot of comments from people about the problem of the debt \nceiling. I have checked and, in all probability, we will reach the debt \nceiling in August. There is a debate on how to handle that. The House \nhas decided to put it in the Appropriations bill, and I have been \nasked, as manager of the bill, to commit that I will not bring this \nbill back from conference with a debt ceiling in it. I can make no such \ncommitment. Neither the Senator from Hawaii nor I can make that \ncommitment. We are committed to doing our job as Senators, carrying out \nour oath to support and defend the Constitution and the people who \nsupport the Constitution.\n  I, for one, am getting a little impatient about getting this bill \ndone. The current bill, I was told, would be done last night, and we \nwould be on our bill now. We are not on the Defense bill now. We should \nbe on the Defense appropriations bill now.\n  I hope and pray every Senator in this body will search his soul about \ndelaying this bill, because I mean what I say: there is no possibility \nof getting this bill to the President, in my judgment, in a matter of \n10 days after we get back unless we pass it now, and the President has \ntime to go through the bill to determine if he is going to sign it.\n  I implore the Senate to finish this bill. Either the Senator from \nHawaii or I have been chairman of the Defense Subcommittee since 1981. \nWe have never found a situation where we would even consider cloture on \nthe Defense appropriations bill.\n  I cannot imagine a Member of this Senate voting against cloture on an \nappropriations bill for defense when there is a war going on.\n  I say to the Senate, it is time to come to our senses and get this \nauthorization bill done tonight so we can get on the appropriations \nbill tonight and finish it tomorrow or, at the latest, Friday morning. \nIf we can get this bill through the subcommittee in 17 minutes and 25 \nminutes in the full committee, this Senate can get through this bill in \n36 hours.\n  I guarantee, if there is any thought of delay, we will stay in \nsession 36 hours because I am going to see to it this bill is passed \nand goes to the President this week. Some people say it is not going to \nhappen, but if I have to embarrass every Member of the Senate to get it \ndone, I am going to do it. This bill must be passed. We are at war. We \nare at war.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum all be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/23/senate-section/article/S7244-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7244-S7265]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          CHILD NUTRITION AND WIC REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2004\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 580, S. 2507.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2507) to amend the Richard B. Russell National \n     School Lunch Act and the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 to \n     provide children with increased access to food and nutrition \n     assistance, to simplify program operations and improve \n     program management, to reauthorize child nutrition programs, \n     and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to present to the Senate S. \n2507, legislation to reauthorize the child nutrition programs \nadministered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture for the next 5 \nyears. Over the past year and a half, the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry has held hearings and received suggestions from \na wide range of interests for improvements in the programs that are \nauthorized in this bill. The committee worked diligently to draft a \nconsensus bill that will ensure the continuation of proven Federal \nGovernment support for meeting the nutritional needs of school children \nand others who will benefit from these programs. I would like to thank \nespecially the distinguished ranking member of the committee, the \nSenator from Iowa, Mr. Harkin, for his assistance and for continuing \nthe longstanding tradition of a bipartisan approach to the development \nof child nutrition bills in our committee.\n  The committee met on May 19, 2004, and reported the bill unanimously. \nThis bill reflects the commitment of the committee to ensure that our \nNation's children have access to the nutrition they need to lead a \nhealthy life. All of the worthwhile and important initiatives contained \nin this bill will play a significant part in ensuring that our children \nhave access to good nutrition.\n  The programs authorized in this bill touch the lives of one out of \nevery five people in this country, including over 37 million children \nand nearly 2 million lower income pregnant and postpartum women. \nAccording to the Congressional Research Service, total fiscal year 2004 \nspending for these programs will be an estimated $16.4 billion, and the \nadministration's fiscal year 2005 budget anticipates spending $16.85 \nbillion. The Budget Committees of both the Senate and House have seen \nfit to include new mandatory money that will enable us to continue \notherwise expiring provisions contained in current law. Even though we \nhad no money for new initiatives, we believe the committee has put \ntogether an overall package that improves these programs while \nprotecting the interests of the participants.\n  Important components of the bill are: Protection of the integrity of \nschool meal program benefits, participation of for-profit child care \ncenters in the Child and Adult Care Food Program,\n\n[[Page S7245]]\n\nprotection of school meal benefits for military families, expansion of \nthe Summer Food Service Program Lugar Pilots, expansion of the Fruit \nand Vegetable Pilot Program, and improvements to the WIC Program.\n  I would also like to clarify section 203(e)(10) of the bill, which is \ndesigned to contain costs in the WIC program in order to ensure that \nall eligible participants can receive benefits through the program. \nGiven the new provisions in the law, it is important that States \npublish their allowable reimbursement levels for WIC program vouchers. \nAlso, because of changes contained in the bill, it would be important \nfor USDA to review and modify risk profiles used when examining retail \nfood stores for compliance with program rules. There is a related \nprovision in our bill that prohibits certain vendors from providing \nincentive items to entice program participants to come to their stores \nunless the free merchandise is food or of nominal value. The Secretary \nis given the authority to define merchandise of nominal value. A \nreasonable interpretation of this provision would permit the Secretary \nto prohibit stores from giving away lottery tickets. Given the \nextremely small chance of winning a large amount of money as advertised \nby the lottery, the actual ticket is probably of very little value. \nHowever, some observers' perceived value of a ticket is greater than \nthe actual value. A reasonable interpretation of this provision would \ngive the Secretary the authority to prohibit lottery tickets under this \nprovision.\n  We have worked hard to craft a bipartisan, consensus-based bill, as \nevidenced by the letters of support we have received from organizations \nincluding the American Dietetic Association, the American School Food \nService Association, America's Second Harvest, the Food Research and \nAction Center, National Council of La Raza, Bread for the World, the \nNational Milk Producers Federation, the International Dairy Foods \nAssociation, and the National Food Processors Association. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the bill.\n\n\n       Addition of New States to the Fruit and Vegetable Program\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I hope to clarify our intent on one \nprovision of the Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act of 2004--\nthe provision pertaining to the Fruit and Vegetable Program.\n  When the Fruit and Vegetable Program was first enacted as part of the \n2002 farm bill, the legislative language did not specify which States \nwere to be participants in the program, but the States were specified \nin the conference report. The Department of Agriculture followed the \nconference recommendations.\n  Because we are passing this bill with a somewhat unusual process that \nwill not involve a conference report, I would like to clarify which \nStates are intended to be added to the program. Committee staff \ndiscussions have intended that the additional States to participate in \nthe Fruit and Vegetable Program are Mississippi, North Dakota, and \nSouth Dakota, and this was our understanding as we finalized this bill. \nI am in agreement with these discussions, and it is on this basis that \nwe are completing this bill.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I do not disagree with the Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n Incentive Criteria for Reduction of Nonresponse Rates and Substitution\n\n  Mr. HARKIN, Mr. President, I hope to clarify the operation of certain \nprovisions in the bill. As the chairman knows, the section of the bill \ntitled, ``Household Applications,'' provides school districts with an \nincentive to reduce the nonresponse rate during the income verification \nprocess. I would like to offer an example of the operation of 10-\npercent improvement criteria in nonresponse rates, so that the \ncommittee's intent is not misinterpreted. A district with a non-\nresponse rate of 40 percent, for example, would have to reduce its \nnonresponse rate to 36 percent, in order to meet the 10-percent \nimprovement criteria and be entitled to maintain existing verification \nprocedures under current law.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. The Senator is, indeed, correct in his calculations. The \nprovision calling for a 10-percent improvement in S. 2507 would operate \nin precisely the manner that the Senator from Iowa described.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the chairman. I would also like to discuss the \nnew substitution provision in the bill. In some school districts in my \nState and across the country, there are children whose household income \nis extremely difficult to verify, no matter how vigorous the effort put \nforth by school officials. The applications I am referring to are for \nchildren whose parents regularly do not respond to other school \ncommunications or are from a community that is suspicious of questions \nfrom governmental entities, including school districts. The families of \nthese children may no longer be residing at the address of record, are \nnot reachable by phone, or may exhibit other such barriers to \nverification. Am I correct that these are the type of applications \nenvisioned in the bill's subparagraph titled ``Individual Review''?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. The Senator is once again correct. This bill recognizes \nthat there are certain situations when it may be nearly impossible for \na school district to get in touch with the families of children who are \neligible for this program. In situations such as those the Senator \ndescribed, and other similar ones, the school district may decline to \nverify up to 5 percent of the approved applications selected for \nverification and replace those applications with other approved \napplications.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the chairman.\n\n\n                        importance of breakfast\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I appreciate the chairman giving me \nthis opportunity to emphasize the importance of breakfast and the \npositive effects breakfast has on student performance and behavior. \nResearch shows that children who eat breakfast perform better on \nstandardized achievement tests and have fewer behavior problems in \nschool. Breakfast improves a child's physical endurance and motor \nperformance. It has been found that children have more energy to get \nthrough the school day.\n  The Department of Agriculture's Center for Nutrition Policy and \nPromotion has shown that children who eat breakfast have more healthy \noverall diets. Given the Nation's attention to childhood obesity, \nbreakfast can also play a positive role in ensuring that our children \nare healthy. Not only is eating breakfast important for student \nperformance, breakfast is also an effective tool to manage and control \nweight. Breakfast consumption can play a key role in maintaining \nhealthy eating habits and weight loss while Congress looks at ways to \ncombat childhood obesity.\n  In a major study, regular breakfast consumption was associated with \nthe ability to maintain a significant weight loss. One study showed \nthat out of 2,900 individuals that had maintained a 30-percent weight \nloss for at least a year, 78 percent reported eating breakfast \neveryday. Breakfast skipping has been reported to be more prevalent in \nobese children and is particularly high in obese girls. More than a \ndozen studies from around the world have reported that eating a ready-\nto-eat, RTE, breakfast cereal provides many nutritional benefits, \nincluding consumption of less total fat, less saturated fat, less \ncholesterol, more dietary fiber, and more vitamins and minerals. This \nresult is independent of age and geography as studies have been \nconducted in children, adults and the elderly in over six different \ncountries.\n  This compromise bill contains provisions which will, hopefully, \nresult in more children eating more breakfast. The Child Nutrition and \nWIC Reauthorization Act of 2004 includes three provisions that the \ncommittee hopes will result in more children eating breakfast. First, \nit provides increased assistance to schools with a high proportion of \npoor children. Second, it expands the eligibility for schools that need \nadditional assistance--severe need assistance--for breakfast programs. \nIn relation to these provisions a Review of Best Practices in the \nBreakfast Program, also contained in this bill, will allow for a study \nof State and local barriers that keep more schools from offering \nbreakfast. The Secretary will make recommendations and describe model \nbreakfast programs that will help schools to overcome these obstacles \nand disseminate the results of this study to school districts, to the \nSenate Committee on Agriculture, and to the House Committee on \nEducation and the Workforce. As a result, schools will be encouraged to \ndevelop innovative strategies to make time for student\n\n[[Page S7246]]\n\nbreakfasts, such as breakfast on the bus or breakfast in the classroom, \na practice that has been shown to be very effective in schools across \nthe country. Breakfast on the bus or in the classroom does not require \nthe use of a cafeteria or additional time in the school day and are \neasy and efficient ways to provide a nutritious meal to children.\n  Mr. President, I ask the chairman if he agrees with my statements?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I agree with the distinguished Senator \nfrom Georgia on the importance of breakfast to our children's \neducation.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for his comments.\n\n\n                  women, infants, and children program\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I wish to address a provision that \nSenator Cochran has added to the Child Nutrition and WIC \nreauthorization bill on my behalf.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, this provision is being added as a part \nof the floor consideration of this legislation. Therefore, there is no \naccompanying report language which explains its effect. We appreciate \nthe contribution the Senator from Alaska has made to the Senate's \nconsideration of this legislation. Will the Senator please share her \nviews on this provision?\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, the provision in question requires the \nSecretary of Agriculture to conduct a periodic scientific review of the \nsupplemental foods available in the Women, Infants, and Children \nProgram, which is also known as the WIC Program. The Secretary shall \nundertake such a review as frequently as necessary to reflect the most \nrecent scientific knowledge. Following such a review, the Secretary \nshall amend the list of supplemental foods in order to reflect \nnutrition, science, public health concerns, and cultural eating \npatterns.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I would like Senator Murkowski to explain \nher rationale for offering this provision.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. In October 2000, the American Heart Association, AHA, \npublished updated guidelines for reducing the risk of heart disease. \nThese guidelines noted that fatty fish, such as salmon, are high in \nomega-3 fatty acids. Such acids help in the prevention of heart disease \nin a variety of ways. The acids diminish the likelihood of sudden \ndeath, as well as abnormal heart rhythms that play a role in sudden \ndeath. The oils of fatty fish also decrease blood triglycerides, as \nwell as blood clotting.\n  The Food and Drug Administration has also previously suggested that \nthere are health benefits to regularly consuming up to 3 grams of \nomega-3 fatty acids per day. To illustrate a practical example, a piece \nof salmon that is a little over 3 ounces in weight includes about 1 \ngram of such fatty acids. Therefore, it would be very easy to comply \nwith this suggestion. I understand that later this year, the Food and \nDrug Administration is likely to make an official determination that \nthe consumption of omega-3 fatty acids will reduce the risk of coronary \nheart disease. The provision in the WIC reauthorization bill will \nrequire the Secretary to conduct a periodic review of the list of \nsupplemental foods and take into account the most recent scientific \nknowledge, such as the expected FDA determination regarding omega-3 \nfatty acids, when recommending any additions to the list of \nsupplemental foods. Should salmon be included in the list of \nsupplemental foods, it would then allow all States to include salmon as \nan acceptable food for their respective WIC recipients.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator's explanation.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I thank Senator Cochran for including \nthis provision in this important bill.\n\n\n                Medicaid Direct Verification Authorities\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, The Child Nutrition and WIC \nReauthorization Act of 2004 includes several provisions intended to \nimprove program integrity and to provide local educational agencies \nwith new tools with which to improve the administration of the school \nlunch and school breakfast programs. One of the steps that we have \ntaken in this bill is to allow various Federal programs to share \ninformation that they may have about a child's income or participation \nstatus with local educational agencies so as to enable the local \neducational agency, using that information, to verify a child's \neligibility status for free or reduced-price school lunches or school \nbreakfasts.\n  In most cases, this bill has not amended any laws outside of the \njurisdiction of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry in order to accomplish this goal--with one exception. The bill \ndoes amend section 1902(a)(7) of the Social Security Act, a section \npertaining to the Medicaid program. This change to Medicaid law allows, \nat the option of a State, the sharing of Medicaid information with \nlocal educational agencies for the purpose of verifying the \ncertification of children for free or reduced price lunches or \nbreakfasts under Federal child nutrition programs.\n  The Senate Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over the Social \nSecurity Act and Medicaid law, has very graciously allowed us to make \nthis change for the purposes of this bill. I thank the Finance \nCommittee for working with our committee to strengthen Federal child \nnutrition programs.\n  It is my understanding that Medicaid eligibility can be based on a \nnumber of factors, some of which may be related to disability or other \nmatters that have nothing to do with verifying income in the School \nLunch Program. I want to clarify that the intent of the amendment to \nMedicaid law contained within the Child Nutrition and WIC \nReauthorization Act of 2004 is solely for the purpose of verifying \nincome and participation information for School Lunch and Breakfast \nPrograms. It is not the intent of this legislation to allow any other \ninformation to be shared.\n  I do not believe that the amendment can be interpreted to allow the \nsharing of Medicaid information that goes beyond the scope of verifying \neligibility for school lunch or school breakfast benefits, but in the \ninterest of being completely crystal clear, I would like to state that, \nunder the amendment to section 1902(a)(7) of the Social Security Act \ncontained in the Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act of 2004, \nno Medicaid information, except that which is necessary to verify \nincome and eligibility for school lunch or school breakfast \nparticipation, may be shared by a State with a local educational \nagency.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. The explanation that Senator Harkin has offered with \nregard to this provision of the Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization \nAct of 2004 is absolutely correct and is consistent with the \ncommittee's intent. In including the amendment to Medicaid law, it was \ncertainly not our goal or intent to allow all Medicaid information to \nbe shared with local educational agencies. We intended to allow States \nto share only such limited Medicaid information that was necessary to \nverify eligibility in the School Lunch or School Breakfast Programs. \nAny interpretation to the contrary is inconsistent with the intent of \nthe Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. As a member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry, but also as the ranking Democrat on the Senate \nFinance Committee, I would like to thank Agriculture Committee Chairman \nCochran and Ranking Member Harkin for their clarification on this \npoint.\n  The Senate Finance Committee has long grappled with the challenges of \nallowing sensitive program information to be shared. While there are \nmany cases where it is in the public good to share limited amounts of \ninformation, such as in this case, it is important that we take such \nsteps carefully and that we not inadvertently or unintentionally allow \nmore information to be shared than is absolutely necessary to \naccomplish our goals.\n  The amendment to the Social Security Act that is under consideration \nensures that only certain Medicaid information can be shared with local \neducational authorities for the purpose of verifying eligibility and \nincome with respect to the School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs. \nInformation about a child's health or disability status or medical \nexpenses would not be relevant to verifying eligibility for school \nbreakfast and lunch programs, which is based only on the child's family \nincome. Accordingly, information\n\n[[Page S7247]]\n\nabout a child's health or disability status or medical expenses could \nnot be shared with local educational agencies under the authority of \nthis Medicaid amendment. I thank the chairman and the ranking member \nfor clarifying the narrow goals of the amendment and look forward to \nits implementation in a manner that is consistent with the committee \nintent.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I appreciate that my colleagues on the Senate \nAgriculture Committee have worked collaboratively on the Medicaid \nprovision, which is under the jurisdiction of the Senate Finance \nCommittee. I am pleased that we were able to work out a provision which \nmay help more children who are eligible receive free or reduced price \nbreakfasts and lunches. I commend my colleagues for their good work on \nthis important legislation.\n  I agree with my colleagues, Senators Cochran, Harkin, and Baucus, \nthat this Medicaid amendment will not authorize States to share \nMedicaid information other than that which is necessary to verify a \nchild's participation in Medicaid or his or her family income.\n\n\n    USDA Interpretation of Section 32 Funding in the 2002 Farm Bill\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President I rise to clarify an important issue with \nthe distinguished chairman of the Agriculture Committee.\n  First, I thank the chairman for his leadership in getting this child \nnutrition bill to the floor. He has worked hard and has produced a \ngood, bipartisan bill which I supported in the Committee.\n  For over 2 years, a bipartisan group of Senators and I have been \nconcerned about USDA disregarding language included in the 2002 farm \nbill. The 2002 farm bill, section 10603, states that at least $200 \nmillion must be spent annually on the purchase of specialty crops. \nHowever additional language included in the 2002 farm bill conference \nreport states:\n\n       [t]he Managers intend that the funds made available under \n     this section are to be used for additional purchases of \n     fruits and vegetables, over and above the purchases made \n     under current law or that might otherwise be made without \n     this authority. The Managers expect the $200 million to be a \n     minimum amount for fruit and vegetable purchases under \n     section 32 funds; it is not intended to interfere with or \n     decrease from Agricultural Marketing Service's historical \n     purchases of fruit and vegetables [e.g. $243 million in 2001; \n     $232 million in 2000] or to decrease or displace other \n     commodity purchases.\n\n  Does the chairman agree that this language is clear and that the \nintent of Congress is $200 million in new purchases on top of existing \ncommodity purchases?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I agree that the Senator from Michigan has correctly \ncited the conference report of the 2002 farm bill, and I appreciate all \nof her hard work on this issue.\n  Ms. STABENOW. This was a great victory for our children because they \nneed more and more fruits and vegetables in their school lunches. We \nall know about the problem we have with kids eating too much junk food \nfor lunch and this program would have put more nutritious foods on our \nchildren's lunch trays. Instead of eating candy, they could be eating \nnutritious foods like apples, pears and carrots.\n  Unfortunately, the USDA is not complying with this provision. Instead \nof adding the $200 million on top of baseline spending, USDA has \neliminated the baseline spending, so there is no guarantee that there \nwill be any new spending on fruits and vegetables for our children. In \nfact in 2002, USDA did not even meet the minimum purchase requirement. \nIn 2002, only $181 million in fresh fruits and vegetables were \npurchased under section 32.\n  Does the chairman agree that the USDA is misinterpreting the farm \nbill with regards to section 32, fresh fruit and vegetable purchases?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I agree that the USDA has not followed the language from \nthe 2002 farm bill conference report. I suggest that the Senator from \nMichigan and I work with USDA to try to facilitate greater purchases of \nfruits and vegetables in the nutrition programs.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am proud of our bipartisan work on the Child Nutrition \nand WIC Reauthorization Act of 2004 and want to thank the chairman for \nhis efforts and leadership. This is a bill that deserves to pass \noverwhelmingly with tremendous bipartisan support, as it did in the \nSenate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry. That it can \ngain the unanimous support of the entire Senate, as I believe that it \nwill, is to me, a hopeful sign of broad support for initiatives in the \ninterest of our Nation's children.\n  In addition to Chairman Cochran, I thank the staff who have worked on \nthis bill. They may never receive the full credit that they truly \ndeserve, but without them this bill would not have come to fruition. On \nSenator Cochran's staff, I would like to thank Hunt Shipman, Eric \nSteiner, Graham Harper, and especially Dave Johnson, who has been with \nthe Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry for \nfifteen years. During that time, he has played a key role in \nstrengthening our country's child nutrition and food assistance \nprograms. On my own staff, I would like to single out for thanks the \ngreat work of Derek Miller and Susan Keith as well as the Democratic \nStaff Director, Mark Halverson, who has served me ably for many years.\n  Given the budget constraints that our committee faced in crafting the \nlegislation, I believe that this bill is a very positive step forward \nin allocating resources wisely.\n  In the United States, we face an unfortunate paradox. On the one \nhand, the specter of malnutrition and hunger continues to haunt \nmillions of Americans, especially children. At the same time, we are \nconfronted with a grave public health threat in the form of obesity and \noverweight which are quickly becoming a major threat not just to \nindividuals but to our Nation as a whole. The reauthorization of child \nnutrition programs affords us an opportunity to tackle both of these \nissues. This bill does so, although not always to the full extent that \nI would have preferred.\n  This bill makes many positive changes to fight childhood hunger and \ndeliver federal child nutrition benefits to more children.\n  First, this bill ensures that children who are receiving food stamps \nwill automatically receive school lunches and breakfasts as well. \nThough States and schools already have the authority and discretion to \ndo this now, not all of them take advantage of this option. The bill \nbefore us today clearly makes those children eligible for free school \nmeals--a step that, according to USDA, will help 200,000 additional \nchildren have healthy school meals by 2009 and which will also reduce \npaperwork in local schools and improve program integrity.\n  Parents of preschool-age children face a big challenge of finding \nsafe, affordable day care. This is especially so for low-income \nfamilies. This bill extends and makes permanent meal assistance to day \ncare centers in which at least 25 percent of enrolled children are low-\nincome. USDA estimates that on an average day approximately 90,000 \nchildren will benefit from this meal assistance.\n  The bill also includes a number of important changes in the process \nto certify students as eligible for free or reduced-price school meals \nand to verify the accuracy of a small percentage of the applications \nfor free and reduced-price school meals. These changes are designed to \nmake sure that more certifications are completed correctly at the start \nof the school year. Improving program integrity has always been a duty \nthat this committee has carried out on a bipartisan basis. Maintaining \nand improving program integrity is critical both to ensuring sound \nstewardship of taxpayer dollars and to guaranteeing that children who \nmost need child nutrition benefits actually receive them.\n  One of the bill's program integrity measures allows schools to \nstrengthen and simplify the verification process under which the income \nlevel of a sample of households must be documented. For example, for \nthe first time, school districts will be able to use Medicaid data to \nverify household income so school districts won't have to duplicate \nverification efforts already undertaken in the Medicaid program, and \nfamilies won't have to document income multiple times. I urge the \nSecretary, State agencies, and local educational agencies to take full \nadvantage of this new option.\n  In addition, once a student is certified for free or reduced-price \nmeals, that certification will be effective for a\n\n[[Page S7248]]\n\nfull year. Those families that are selected for verification will be \nable to provide documentation for any point in time between the month \nprior to application and the time the income documentation is provided. \nThough the bill itself does not specify an exact time, the Secretary \nshould not narrow the period and should issue guidance instructing \nlocal educational authorities to accept as income verification \ndocumentation any information pertaining to any point in time within \nthe interval between the month prior to when the school meals \napplication was completed and when the income documentation is \nprovided.\n  The supplemental nutrition program for Women, Infants and Children, \nWIC, provides vouchers to eligible low-income families for specified \nfood items. Recipients redeem these vouchers at local vendors. In \nrecent years, a specialized type of vendor, known as WIC-only stores or \nsupplemental foods vendors, has developed that accepts only WIC \nvouchers. These vendors do not compete for business on the basis of \nprice, but rather on the service they provide their WIC clientele. This \nbill includes several important measures designed to contain WIC food \ncosts. The committee report on this bill contains a good deal of \ninformation on WIC-only stores and on the provisions intended to \naddress them. However, the bill language on WIC-only cost containment \nhas changed somewhat, and additional clarification may be helpful here.\n\n  Although the legislative language offers States latitude to design \nvendor peer groups, competitive price criteria, and maximum \nreimbursement levels, each State must meet two important cost-\ncontainment goals unless exempted by the Secretary. First, each State \nmust ensure that its aggregate WIC food costs are no higher if WIC \nparticipants choose to shop at WIC-only stores than if they shop at \nregular competitive stores. Second, each State must ensure that average \nprices, referred to as ``average payments per voucher'', in WIC-only \nstores are no higher than average prices in comparable competitive \nstores.\n  The bill allows the Secretary to exempt a State from carrying out \nrequirements regarding the peer groups, competitive price criteria, and \nmaximum reimbursement levels if the State does not authorize WIC-only \nstores or if the WIC-only stores in the State account for less than 5 \npercent of the State's total WIC food sales. If a State is exempt \nbecause the WIC-only stores in the State account for less than 5 \npercent of the State's total WIC food sales, the State is nonetheless \nrequired to ensure that its aggregate food costs are no higher if WIC \nparticipants choose to shop at WIC-only stores rather than at regular \ncompetitive stores.\n  Because WIC-only stores do not market items outside of the WIC \nprogram, the stores' earnings necessarily flow from the WIC program. To \nensure that WIC dollars are not spent on non-WIC items, the bill \nprohibits giveaways of incentive items or other free merchandise by \nWIC-only stores unless the store can demonstrate that the items or \nmerchandise were obtained at no cost. Although an exemption for food or \nmerchandise of nominal value has been added since the committee \napproved this bill, the intent of the bill remains to ban giveaways of \nthe kind of items that are currently given away, such as diapers, \nstrollers, bicycles, small kitchen appliances, other household \nproducts, and two-for-one offers on WIC food items. Food or merchandise \nof nominal value is meant to include items of lesser value than these \nitems. In issuing guidance or regulations on this matter, the Secretary \nmust ensure that even offering items of nominal value does not \nunnecessarily drive up costs in the WIC program.\n  This bill also includes important provisions on infant formula cost \ncontainment competitive bidding which will, I believe, ensure that the \nWIC program continues to benefit from the strength of the competitive \nmarketplace and the infant formula rebates that enable so many children \nto participate in the WIC program.\n  I am pleased that this bill takes positive steps to enhance child \nnutrition and to address the epidemic of overweight and obesity in this \ncountry as well. Let there be no mistake, poor nutrition early in life \nlays the foundation for chronic disease and premature death later in \nlife. According to the CDC, poor diet and physical inactivity will soon \novertake smoking as the Nation's leading cause of death. In 2000, \n400,000 deaths were associated with poor diet and physical inactivity.\n  This fiscal year the Federal Government will invest over $8.3 billion \nin the school lunch and school breakfast programs, and this bill is a \n5-year extension of this investment. The food served in these Federal \nschool food programs meets Federal guidelines and provides balanced \nnutrition for the children who eat school meals. But in a majority of \nhigh schools and middle schools and an alarming number of elementary \nschools these school food programs and our taxpayer investment in them \nare undermined by an array of less nutritious food choices.\n  These foods that are sold in competition with the school meals are \noften high in fat, sugar and sodium. When kids choose these foods, they \nchoose not to eat taxpayer supported, nutritionally balanced meals \nprovided through the School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs. Not \nsurprisingly, studies show that when kids get their lunches through \nvending machines at school their diets aren't nearly as healthy as when \nthey obtain their meals through the school meal programs. In fact, \namong school-aged children only 2 percent meet the dietary \nrecommendations for all food groups.\n  Research shows that a la carte items and vending machines displace \nstudent consumption of more nutritious foods. In one study, students \nfrom schools that did not offer a la carte foods consumed half a \nserving more of fruit and a whole serving more of vegetables per day \nthan did children in schools that did have a la carte programs. In \nanother study, when kids gained access to foods other than through the \nSchool Lunch Program, they consumed 33 percent less fruit, 42 percent \nless vegetables, and 35 percent less milk.\n  Not surprisingly, poor diets contribute to childhood obesity and \noverweight children, with significant negative effects. Compared to \nregular-weight children, overweight children are more likely to have \nhigh levels of cholesterol, high blood pressure, high levels of \ninsulin, and exhibit generally higher numbers of risk factors for \ncardiovascular disease. Between 50 and 80 percent of diabetes cases are \nassociated with diet and sedentary lifestyles.\n  And it is not just about obesity. The lack of fruits, vegetables, and \nmilk in our children's diets has tremendous ramifications for the \nhealth of kids and adults. Poor eating habits early in life lay the \nfoundation for chronic disease and premature death at a later age. \nCancer, heart disease, and osteoporosis are just a few of the many \ndiseases associated with poor diet.\n  Because schools receive substantial revenue from the sale of junk \nfood at school, some folks are concerned that schools will suffer \nfinancially if they replace junk food with healthier choices. I \nunderstand this concern, but I disagree with the premise. Many schools \nhave stocked their vending machines and snack bars with healthy food, \nwith no negative impact on revenue. Wide-open sales of unhealthy foods \nin schools hasn't always been the norm. Back in the 1970s, Congress \ngave the Secretary of Agriculture the authority to set nutrition \nguidelines to make sure our child nutrition programs work. Congress \nintended for that authority to extend to all food sales throughout the \nschool and for the entire school day. And this is what the regulations \nput forth by USDA did.\n\n  However, the courts subsequently struck that authority down--wrongly, \nin my opinion. As a result, USDA regulations only apply to foods sold \nin the school cafeteria and during mealtime rather than to the entire \nschool and school day. This has left us with this crazy situation in \nwhich, rather than getting a decent meal in the school cafeteria at \nlunch, kids can instead just go to the vending machines in the hall for \na soft drink and junk food.\n  I believe that Congress should reinstate the Secretary of \nAgriculture's authority to set nutritional standards for foods \navailable anywhere on school grounds at any time of the day. The \nSecretary would then determine, after public comment, how to use that \nauthority.\n  This bill takes a different approach, but one that I believe holds \ngreat promise for improving the dietary\n\n[[Page S7249]]\n\nquality of foods sold in our Nation's schools.\n  First, it extends and expands the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program. \nTwo years ago in the farm bill, we created a pilot program to provide \nfree fresh and dried fruits and vegetables to children. The pilot \ncovered 25 schools in each of 4 states and 7 schools on an Indian \nreservation. This program has been remarkably popular with the schools, \nbut more importantly, with the students.\n  In a world in which grocery clerks may not know a radish from a \nrutabaga, it is encouraging to see elementary, middle school and high \nschool students eating fruits and vegetables that they have never seen \nbefore and loving them.\n  This bill continues the fruit and vegetable program in the current \nstates and expands it to 4 additional states and additional schools on \nIndian reservations. I would like to do more, but this is strong \nprogress toward getting more fruits and vegetables in all schools \nacross the Nation.\n  This bill also requires schools that participate in the National \nSchool Lunch or School Breakfast Programs to craft, with broad input \nfrom parents and others, plans that include goals for nutrition \neducation, physical activity, and other activities to promote student \nwellness. The plans must also include nutrition guidelines for all \nfoods sold in school.\n  This is not an attack on any particular type of food. Rather, school \nwellness policies, as required by this bill, pertain to healthy \nlifestyles more broadly and look at all foods in school, not just those \nin vending machines and snack bars. It does not mandate what foods can \nbe offered or stipulate their content, but it does ask local schools to \nset standards that they believe are appropriate.\n  The bill also provides USDA with mandatory funds to help schools to \nestablish their own local wellness policies. I wish that it provided \nmore or this technical assistance, but it is a positive first step.\n  In my mind, these local wellness policies are a potentially \nrevolutionary step towards improving our children's health. They \nprovide real empowerment at the local school level. I look forward to \nseeing how schools endeavor to craft these policies and the effect that \nthey have on school nutrition environments and children's health.\n  I also hope that, as schools work to craft their own wellness \npolicies, they provide fertile ground for innovation and creative \nthinking. It is past time that all sectors of our society focus less on \ntreating sickness, and focus more on promoting health and preventing \nobesity and chronic disease. This bill, in several ways, moves toward \nthat goal and harnesses a potent force, our schools, in the efforts to \nbe healthier as a country.\n  I thank my colleagues for their assistance and input on this \nimportant bill as well as for their support.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Cochran \namendment which is at the desk be agreed to, that the bill, as amended, \nbe read a third time and passed, that the motions to reconsider be laid \nupon the table, and that any statements relating to the bill be printed \nin the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The first step is that I yield the floor such \nthat the Chair can recognize the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3400\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I ask for regular order with regard to amendment No. \n3400.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is now pending.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I understand there will be a second-\ndegree amendment offered to my amendment which is to bring a small \nmeasure of relief to military families by allowing the FMLA-eligible \nfamily members of deployed personnel to be able to use the FMLA \nbenefits for issues directly related to or resulting from their loved \none's deployment. This has been accepted by the body previously and put \ninto other legislation. It was certainly my hope that we would be able \nto move forward with this. It is something our military families \ndesperately need. However, it is my understanding that this second-\ndegree amendment would require protracted debate. It is in our interest \nto move this important Department of Defense authorization bill \nforward.\n  Mr. WARNER. If the Senator would withhold.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield to the Senator.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3475 to Amendment No. 3400\n\n       (Purpose: To enable military family members to take time \n     off to attend to deployment-related business, tasks, and \n     other family issues.)\n\n  Mr. WARNER. There is at the desk a second-degree amendment which I \nsubmit on behalf of Senator Gregg and myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner], for Mr. Gregg, for \n     himself and Mr. Warner, proposes an amendment 3475 to \n     amendment 3400.\n\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, Senator Feingold has offered an amendment \nintended to help military families who have a family member activated \nin support of a contingency operation. First of all, I make it clear \nthat all of us want to assist families placed in the difficult position \nof operating with one family member called to duty.\n  That is why the underlying bill contains provisions such as \npermanently increasing the Family Separation Allowance, FSA, payable to \ndeployed servicemen and women with dependents up to $250 a month.\n  But the proposal made by Senator Feingold to expand the Family \nMedical Leave Act is not the right approach. I rise to offer an \nalternative proposal as a second-degree amendment. The amendment I am \noffering today presents military families a much better method for \nobtaining the flexibility they may need to prepare for activation and \nto keep the family running while a family member is called to duty.\n  The Feingold amendment would offer some employees unpaid leave. My \namendment will offer paid leave. While the Feingold amendment applies \nonly to those military family members that work for employers with 50 \nor more employees, and offers no assistance at all to individuals who \nwork for smaller employers, my amendment will apply to all military \nfamily employees subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act.\n  The Feingold amendment will also create uncertainty and animosity in \nthe workplace by giving employees the vaguely defined right to take \nintermittent leave with minimal notice for any ``issue relating to \n``the family member's service''--a phrase which can be interpreted to \ncover just about any activity.\n  My amendment, on the other hand offers a clear method for earning and \nusing paid leave time.\n  The Feingold amendment is a mandate in search of a problem--no need \nhas been demonstrated for it and in\n\n[[Page S7266]]\n\nfact, in a recent survey of activated Armed Service members' spouses, \n80 percent stated that their employers were supportive of their need to \ncomplete pre-activation tasks.\n\n  In light of this existing support by employers, my amendment creates \na voluntary system of adding flextime to the work schedule. Therefore, \nemployers who already have programs in place to accommodate military \nfamilies will have the option of maintaining those programs or adopting \na flextime initiative, they will not be forced to add another \ncomplicated layer onto the already confusing Family and Medical Leave \nlaw.\n  I also point out that the Feingold amendment has never been the \nsubject of a single House or Senate hearing. I am sure that many of my \ncolleagues, like me, have heard from businesses concerned about the \ndifficulties they will face in interpreting and implementing the \nFeingold amendment.\n  Flextime proposals, however, have been vetted in no fewer than 8 \nhearings in the Senate and the U.S. House of Representatives. There is \nalso concerns that the Feingold amendment may threaten the operation of \nmilitary bases. According to the Department of Defense. ``If a major \nmilitary unit were deployed from a single base, this policy could \neffectively shut down the installation depending upon the number of \nfamily member employees covered.''\n  My amendment would not present such a threat to military \ninstallations because it does not apply to public employees.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I recognize that all of us want to do what we \ncan to ease the burden on families who have a family member--be it a \nspouse, parent or child--serving to protect our nation. The sacrifice \nthey are willing to make is nothing short of remarkable. I believe the \napproach I am offering here today is the best way to help these \nfamilies. I urge my colleagues to support my amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Feingold amendment builds on a time \ntested law, the Family Medical Leave Act, to allow family members \nflexibility to prepare to send their loved ones to Iraq, Afghanistan, \nand elsewhere abroad to fight on behalf of their Nation. The Family \nMedical Leave Act has helped more than 35 million Americans over the \nlast 10 years. It will help even more under the Feingold amendment. The \namendment will allow family members to take the time off they need to \nmeet child care needs, care for elderly parents, and otherwise balance \ntheir family responsibilities as their loved ones prepare for active \nduty.\n  The reason this laudable Feingold amendment is being withdrawn is \nbecause our colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to give our \nmilitary families a pay cut.\n  Corporate profits are growing, while worker wages are not. Yet \nRepublicans keep trying to implement more policies that are bad for \nworkers. First, Republicans took away overtime protections from \nmillions of Americans. Now, they want to give employers additional \npower to decide how workers are to be compensated for their overtime \nwork.\n  The Fair Labor Standards Act, FLSA, currently requires employers to \npay workers time-and-a-half for hours worked in excess of 40 per week. \nWhen workers put in overtime hours now, they have a right to time and \nhalf pay, and they have total control over how or when to use that pay.\n  The Gregg amendment would allow employers to pay workers nothing for \novertime work at the time the work is performed, in exchange for a \npromise of a new schedule. Under current law, employers are free to \noffer more flexible schedules. The only difference is that they have to \npay workers for their overtime hours.\n  For those who work overtime, overtime pay constitutes 25 percent of \ntheir pay. Middle class families, already squeezed in today's economy, \nrely on these added earnings for their children's college tuition, \ntheir own retirement, or even to meet their monthly bills. In fact, \nmillions of workers depend on cash overtime to make ends meet and pay \ntheir housing, food and healthcare bills.\n  The Gregg proposal has insufficient enforcement provisions to ensure \nthat employees will not be forced to change their schedules instead of \ngetting overtime pay. This will mean a pay cut for millions of \nAmericans. Workers deserve a pay raise, not a pay cut.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support \nfor the amendment offered by Senator Feingold.\n  Senator Feingold's amendment, which I am proud to cosponsor, would \nallow the work of the Inspector General of the Coalition Provisional \nAuthority, CPA-IG, to continue its work uninterrupted after the June 30 \nhandover.\n  This is critical. Congress provided more than $18 billion to rebuild \nIraq, roughly the same amount that we spend on the rest of the world \ncombined. Congress jammed through the Iraq supplemental appropriations \nbill in an extremely short time, without a sufficient number of \nhearings, into a very chaotic environment without the usual financial \ncontrols.\n  Recognizing this reality, Congress created a strong, independent \ninspector general to help police these funds.\n  In the months that followed passage of the Iraq supplemental, we \nheard numerous reports of waste, fraud, and abuse. If anything, this \nshould have sent a clear signal to the administration and Congress that \nwe need more--not less--oversight of these funds.\n  It defies logic then that the State Department is now proposing to \nweaken the one entity that Congress specifically tasked with keeping \ntrack of these tax dollars.\n  The State Department's plan could undermine the independence of this \ninspector general and disrupt this important work, reducing Congress's \nability to account for these funds. It is unlocking the vault to those \nwho want to cheat us.\n  The State Department also has told the Appropriations Committee that \nit will have to create 25 new positions to handle the work in Iraq.\n  Let me get this straight. We want to close down an IG that has about \n60 people in place, which are actively conducting audits and rooting \nout waste, fraud, and abuse.\n  After the administration is finished closing down that office, they \nwill turn around and hire 25 new people to do the same work--only \nthrough at a lower level office at the State Department.\n  Why on Earth would we want to do this? At a time when we are hearing \nweekly reports of abuse by Halliburton and others, why would we want to \nreinvent the wheel? Why would we downgrade the status of the CPA-IG and \nundermine its independence? It just does not make any sense.\n  This is why the amendment offered by the Senator from Wisconsin is so \nimportant.\n  This is why I support his amendment.\n  Last year Senator Feingold and I offered an amendment to the \nsupplemental bill for Iraq and Afghanistan that established an \ninspector general for the Coalition Provisional Authority so that there \nwould be one auditing body completely focused on ensuring taxpayer \ndollars are spent wisely and efficiently, and that this effort is free \nof waste, fraud, and abuse.\n  Today the CPA, as we all know, is phasing out, but the reconstruction \neffort has only just begun. According to the Congressional Research \nService, as of May 18, only $4.2 billion of the $18.4 billion Congress \nappropriated for reconstruction in November had even been obligated. \nThis amendment would ensure that the inspector general's office can \ncontinue its important work even after June 30 rather than being \ncompelled to start wrapping up and shutting down while so much \nimportant work remains to be done.\n  It renames the Office of the CPA IG, changing it to Special Inspector \nGeneral for Iraq Reconstruction. The amendment establishes that this \ninspector general shall continue operating until the lion's share of \nthe money Congress has appropriated to date for the Iraq relief and \nreconstruction fund has been obligated.\n  American taxpayers have been asked to shoulder a tremendous burden \nwhen it comes to the reconstruction of Iraq. Over 20 billion taxpayer \ndollars have been appropriated for the Iraq relief and reconstruction \nfund. That is more than the entire fiscal year 2004 Foreign Operations \nannual appropriation. It is more than the entire fiscal year 2004 \nForeign Operations annual appropriation. This is a tremendous sum to \ndevote to one country.\n  We all agreed last year that it required an entity on the ground, \nexclusively focused on this effort, to ensure\n\n[[Page S7267]]\n\nadequate funding and oversight. We agreed that we need a qualified, \nindependent watchdog with all the powers and the authorities that \naccrue to inspectors general under the Inspector General Act of 1978. \nWe agreed that business as usual whereby individual agency IG's attempt \nto oversee this mammoth effort in addition to everything else the \nagency does it simply not appropriate in this case.\n  There is nothing ordinary about the nature of the U.S. taxpayer \ninvestment in Iraq. Ordinary measures will not suffice.\n  This amendment modifies the legislation creating this IG to ensure \nthat it does not disappear along with the CPA, but instead continues to \noperate until the amount of reconstruction spending in Iraq more \nclosely resembles other large bilateral foreign assistance programs, \nwhich are overseen by existing agency inspectors general. Specifically, \nto phases out the special IG after 80 percent of the Iraq Relief and \nReconstruction Fund appropriated to date is obligated. If that fund \ngrows substantially in the next calendar, then Congress can consider \nthe wisdom of adjusting this mandate accordingly.\n  Let there be no confusion, this inspector general is only tasked with \noverseeing how U.S. taxpayer dollars are spent. It does not have a \nmandate to oversee Iraqi resources. That is not what this is about. So \nthere is nothing at all in continuing this operation that is \ninconsistent with the transfer of sovereignty on June 30.\n  Because the Department of Defense has responsibility for what is \nhappening to some reconstruction dollars and the Department of State \nwill have responsibility going forward, it makes good sense to have a \nfocused IG on the ground who is able to see the entire picture at \nonce--not being completely required to just focus on the State \nDepartment position or just focus on the Department of Defense portion. \nThis amendment is in no way hostile to the reconstruction effort. This \namendment is about trying to get it right.\n  Suggesting that a special inspector general's office continues to be \nin order in Iraq is hardly revolutionary. As I have mentioned, the \nreconstruction budget for Iraq is bigger than the entire fiscal year \n2004 Foreign Operations Appropriations bill. Yet five different \ninspectors general--at USAID, at the State Department, at the Defense \nDepartment, at the Treasury, and at the Export-Import Bank--are charged \nwith overseeing portions of that account. In fact, currently some 41 \nFederal establishments and designated Federal entities with annual \nbudgets less than $21 billion have their own, independent, statutorily \nmandated inspector general, from the Railroad Retirement Board to the \nSmithsonian Institution. We ask for focused accountability when \ntaxpayer dollars are a stake in these situations. We must demand the \nsame in Iraq.\n  Obviously, when you are talking about $20 billion just for this Iraq \nsituation, we have to do the same thing. We must demand the same in \nIraq.\n  To date, the Inspector General for the Coalition Provisional \nAuthority has made important progress, and has some 30 active \ninvestigations and 19 audits underway. A whistleblower hotline \nestablished by the inspector general has received hundreds of calls. \nThis is clearly not the time to pull the plug on his important effort.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. This is the critical \npoint: To oppose this amendment is to vote for less oversight of the \nreconstruction effort in Iraq than we have today. It is a step backward \nif we don't. We cannot abdicate our oversight responsibility. The \nstakes are far too high for that.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 3400 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. In light of the offering of the second-degree \namendment, I am about to ask unanimous consent to withdraw my \namendment, but I first indicate how important it is we provide this \nFMLA benefit to these families. Obviously, this issue will return, but \nin the spirit of trying to resolve this issue and move the bill \nforward, I now ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment No. 3400.\n  Mr. WARNER. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is withdrawn.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 3475 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. WARNER. And the second-degree amendment likewise is withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Before the Senator from Wisconsin leaves the Senate, I want \nthe record to indicate he has worked hard on issues relating to \nveterans. This is no exception.\n  I know the Senator, when he travels home to Wisconsin, will meet with \nAmerican Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars, and other such assembled \ngroups. By looking at this record, they should understand what the \nSenator from Wisconsin has tried to do for the veterans of this \ncountry. I applaud and commend the Senator from Wisconsin for his \ntenacity. And he will be back, knowing the Senator from Wisconsin, to \nfight another day.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3288\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I now ask for the regular order with \nregard to amendment No. 3288.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, for this amendment, which I offered \nearlier and had the yeas and nays ordered on, I now ask unanimous \nconsent that the yeas and nays be vitiated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WARNER. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the committee \nfor his cooperation and for his support on this important amendment, \nwhich I understand will be accepted. This amendment allows the \nimportant work of the Inspector General of the CPA in Iraq to continue \nafter the June 30 transition.\n  We are talking here about $20 billion of American taxpayers' dollars. \nOnly about $4.5 billion has already been contracted for. So the \nremainder is still going to be expended. There are a great deal of \naudits and other efforts being made on the ground. That should \ncontinue. This has to do with protecting the American taxpayers.\n  I am delighted both the chairman and ranking member have expressed \nsupport for this amendment. I am confident, with their assurances, that \nthis amendment will make it all the way through the process and become \nthe law of the land so this fine work of this inspector general can \ncontinue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the matter has been discussed between \nmyself, Senator Levin, Senator Harry Reid, and the distinguished \nSenator from Wisconsin. The concept of the inspector general is a \nproven concept. It is a valuable concept in the administration of our \nexpenditures to have accountability.\n  We shall work on it to see that from that conference evolves, \nhopefully, an amendment that is a part of the statute to be \nincorporated eventually from the conference report that reflects the \ngoals the Senator has set out. That is correct.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, as to the amendment as we have crafted \nit, which was carefully and specifically crafted, I take the chairman's \ncomment to indicate the approach we have taken in the Senate is the \napproach he will be advocating in conference.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank and congratulate the Senator from \nWisconsin for this amendment. He has been an absolute bulldog when it \ncomes to protecting taxpayers' dollars, just as he has been a fighter \nfor veterans, as in his previous discussion.\n  I want to tell him I know we will be fighting with all of our energy \nin conference to retain this provision. It is vitally important there \nbe this kind of an inspector general review and an inspector general \nwho has the kind of independent power the Senator from Wisconsin has \nalways fought for. We intend to do exactly that, to carry out, to wage \nhis battle in conference to retain this provision.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I join in thanking the Senator for his \ncooperation.\n  I draw the attention of the ranking member to suggest at this point \nin time we clear a package of managers' amendments.\n  Mr. LEVIN. We need to pass this amendment first.\n\n[[Page S7268]]\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes, please.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Feingold amendment is still the pending \nquestion.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I urge that the amendment be adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3288) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about a very simple \namendment that everyone should support. This amendment requires the \nInspector General of the Department of Defense (DOD-IG), in \nconsultation with the Inspectors General of the State Department and \nthe CIA, to conduct a comprehensive investigation into the programs and \nactivities of the Iraqi National Congress.\n  Over the last 10 years, we have seen funds from the U.S. Government \nspent in highly questionable, if not fraudulent ways, including money \nspent on oil paintings and health club memberships.\n  But this is only the tip of the iceberg. A number of serious \nquestions remain unanswered concerning the INC. Here are a couple of \nexamples:\n  First, the INC spent millions in setting up offices around the world, \nincluding London, Prague, Damacus, and Tehran. The State Department's \ninternal documents indicated that they really had no idea of what was \nhappening in some of these offices--especially Tehran. In light of the \nrecent press reports about INC intelligence sharing with Iran, I think \nthe DOD-IG should take a look at this issue and see what was happening \nin the Tehran office. We need to get to the bottom of this.\n  Second, the INC spent millions to set up radio and television \nbroadcasting inside Iraq. The radio program seemed redundant as the \nU.S. Government was, at the time, funding Radio Free Iraq. A New York \nTimes article questioned the effectiveness of the TV broadcasting \nprogram. Kurdish officials indicated that, despite repeated attempts, \nthey could never pickup the INC's TV broadcast inside Iraq. This, \nagain, raises questions about how this money is being spent. The IG \nshould examine this issue. We need to get to the bottom of this.\n  Third the INC's Informaiton Collection Program--funded initially by \nthe State Department and later by the Defense Department--continues to \nbe a source of controversy and mystery. I have a memo here, written by \nthe INC to Appropriations Committee staff, detailing the INC's \nInformation Collection Program. In this memo, the INC claims to have \nwritten numerous reports to senior Administration officials, who are \nlisted in this memo, on topics including WMD proliferation. The \nAdministration disputes this claim. Again, we need to get to the botton \nof this.\n  I could go on and on. However, in the interests of time, I will \nsimply say that there are many, serious unanswered questions about the \nINC's activities.\n  What was the INC doing with U.S. taxpayer dollars? What was going on \nin the Tehran office? Did the Information Collection Program contribute \nto intelligence failures in Iraq? Were the broadcasting programs at all \neffective in gathering support for U.S. efforts in Iraq?\n  To be sure, there have been a few investigations into INC. However, \nthese have been incomplete, offering only a glimpse of what occurred.\n  A few years ago, the State Department Inspector General issued two \nreports on the INC. But these reports only covered $4.3 million and \nexamined only the Washington and London Offices. The State Department \nIG informed my office yesterday that these are the only two audits they \nconducted and have no plans to conduct audits on this issue.\n  A GAO report, published earlier this year, summarized the different \ngrant agreements that the State Department entered into with the INC, \nbut this report did not attempt to answer the myriad questions that \nremain about the INC.\n  Another GAO report is underway, but this looks only at the narrow \nquestion of whether the INC violated U.S. laws concerning the use of \ntaxpayer funds to pay for public propaganda.\n  Finally, according to press reports, the Intelligence Committee is \nlooking to a few issues related to the INC.\n  My amendment is consistent with these investigations. The DOD-IG does \nnot have to reinvent the wheel. It can build off this existing body of \nwork to answer questions that will remain long after these \ninvestigation have been completed.\n  Mr. President, my amendment is about transparency. My amendment is \nabout accountability. My amendment is about getting to the bottom of \none of the most mismanaged programs in recent history.\n  Most importantly, my amendment is about learning from our mistakes so \nwe do not repeat them in the future. I urge my colleague to support my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3315, As Modified\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, there is an amendment pending by Senator \nLandrieu; is that true?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. The number of that amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Amendment No. 3315.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be a \nmodification to the amendment offered by Senators Landrieu, Snowe, \nEnsign, and Mikulski.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, there is no objection. The matter has been \ncarefully worked through the course of the evening, and it is ready for \naction by the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is modified.\n  The amendment (No. 3315), as modified, is as follows:\n       On page 130, after line 9, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 642.

The \n     total amount of the premiums to be paid by a person under the \n     regulations shall be equal to the sum of--\n       (i) the total amount by which the retired pay of the person \n     would have been reduced before the effective date of the \n     election if the person had elected to participate in the \n     Survivor Benefit Plan (for the same base amount specified in \n     the election) at the first opportunity that was afforded the \n     member to participate under chapter 73 of title 10, United \n     States Code;\n       (ii) interest on the amounts by which the retired pay of \n     the person would have been so reduced, computed from the \n     dates on which the retired pay would have been so reduced at \n     such rate or rates and according to such methodology as the \n     Secretary of Defense determines reasonable; and\n       (iii) any additional amount that the Secretary determines \n     necessary to protect the actuarial soundness of the \n     Department of Defense Military Retirement Fund against any \n     increased risk for the fund that is associated with the \n     election.\n       (B) Premiums paid under the regulations shall be credited \n     to the Department of Defense Military Retirement Fund.\n       (C) In this paragraph, the term ``Department of Defense \n     Military Retirement Fund'' means the Department of Defense \n     Military Retirement Fund established under section 1461(a) of \n     title 10, United States Code.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3467\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the second-\ndegree amendment, No. 3467, offered by the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I urge adoption of the second-degree \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3467) was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3315, As Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question now is on agreeing to the first-\ndegree amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the first-degree amendment, \nas modified, is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3315) was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have worked with the Senator from \nLouisiana for many hours today on this amendment. There was an article \nwritten, and I joke with the Senator from Louisiana. She was the \nfeature of a veterans publication. They had a picture of her with her \nsleeves rolled up, muscles showing: ``Military Mary.''\n  Mary Landrieu is someone who looks out for the military. And I call \nher, joke with her, and ask her: How is ``Military Mary'' doing? She is \nvery proud of this name she has picked up. Tonight is an indication of \nwhy she deserves that name. She has been outstanding in her advocacy \nfor American\n\n[[Page S7270]]\n\nveterans. This agreement we have here tonight indicates she is not only \na good advocate for the military but a very fine Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, just one word, now that we have adopted the \nLandrieu amendment. Chairman Warner and I used to have the privilege of \nhaving Senator Landrieu on the Armed Services Committee. We saw \nfirsthand what a tigress she is and was relative to military matters. \nShe is no longer on our committee, and we do miss her, indeed. But she \nbrings and displays that fervor here on the floor frequently. We thank \nher for her tenacity. Talk about tenacity, she has a full supply of it. \nWe commend and congratulate her.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, reference was made to the hard work \nSenator Landrieu performed on this amendment. Indeed, I was witness to \nthat. But it did bring back a fond memory to me. In the period during \nthe war in Vietnam, there was a very colorful and strong chairman in \nthe House Armed Services Committee named Eddie Hebert from New Orleans, \nLA, and a gentleman who worked very closely with him, named Moon \nLandrieu. They were quite a team. They did a great deal working \ntogether for the men and women of the U.S. military.\n  When reference was made to Senator Landrieu's accomplishments, I am \nsure she would agree with me that the teachings of her distinguished \nfather and the former chairman of the House Armed Services Committee \nhave vested in her a lot of wisdom about military matters.\n  I also recognize the work done by Senators Ensign and Snowe. I have \nbeen working with both of them over a period of time. Senator Ensign \nand Senator Snowe each have put in previous pieces of legislation which \nbasically covered this same subject. In the course of the past 48 \nhours, those two Senators have been working in collaboration with \nSenator Landrieu in an effort to get the Senate to take the action that \nwe just took on that amendment. So I thank the Senator from Maine and \nthe Senator from Nevada for their work.\n  As veterans look to the action taken by the Senate, they can decide \nfor themselves on the work done by these Senators, and all Senators, \nbecause there was a unanimous vote on this amendment. I think we \nfulfilled our obligation to that very important class of individuals, \nthe veterans; and particularly in this case, this provides benefits for \nthe widows primarily--there are a few remaining spouses--but basically \nthe widows who are at a critical time in their life and there is need \nfor special consideration as it relates to personal finances. So I \nthank the Presiding Officer and I yield the floor.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Landrieu-\nSnowe amendment because it corrects an injustice being visited upon the \nsurvivors of our servicemembers killed in action and military retirees \nunder the current military Survivor Benefit Plan, or SBP.\n  As the program currently operates, the widows or widowers of those \nwho have ``borne the battle'' receive an annuity equal to 55 percent of \nthe servicemember's retirement pay. That is, until they turn 62. At \nthat time, under current law, a surviving spouse's SBP benefits must be \nreduced either by a Social Security offset, or a reduction in payments \nto 35 percent of retired pay--a drop of almost 40 percent--simply \nbecause they have reached the age of 62.\n  For example, let's take the widow of a Navy chief petty officer or E-\n7 who had served 20 years before retiring. Before she reaches 62, this \nwidow will receive $786 per month, but on her 62nd birthday, that \nbenefit drops to only $500 per month--a loss of $2,432 per year.\n  For a retired O-5, say a Marine Corps lieutenant colonel, the widow's \nbenefit would drop by $6,960 a year as soon as she turns 62. That is \nquite a birthday gift.\n  But the inequities don't stop there. For example, the military \nSurvivor Benefit Plan does not measure up to the federal Survivor \nBenefit Plan in terms of benefits paid to survivors. Survivors of \nfederal civilian retirees under the original Civil Service Retirement \nSystem receive 55 percent of their spouse's retired pay for life--with \nno drop in benefits at age 62. Under the newer Federal Employee \nRetirement System, survivors still receive 50 percent of retired pay \nfor life, again with no drop at age 62.\n  Mr. President, yet another reason that we should adopt this \nlegislation is that members of the military pay more than their share \nof Survivor Benefit Plan program costs, as compared to their federal \ncivilian counterparts.\n  Originally, the Congress intended the government to subsidize 40 \npercent of the cost of military Survivor Benefit Plan premiums--similar \nto the government's contribution to the federal civilian plan. Over the \nlast several decades, however, there has been a significant decline in \nthe government's cost share, and Department of Defense actuaries advise \nthat the government subsidy is now down to less than 20 percent. This \nmeans that military retirees are now paying more than 80 percent of \nprogram costs from their retired pay versus the intended 60 percent.\n  Contrast this to the federal civilian SBP, which has a 52 percent \ncost share for those under the Civil Service Retirement System and a 67 \npercent cost share for those employees, including many of our own \nstaff, under the Federal Employees Retirement System. While it is true \nthat there are differences between the civilian and military premium \ncosts, with federal civilians paying more, it is also true that \nmilitary retirees generally retire earlier than their federal civilian \ncounterparts, and as a result, pay premiums for many more years.\n  This amendment will raise, over a 3\\1/2\\-year period, the percentage \nof the retirement annuity received by the survivor from 35 percent to \n55 percent after age 62. During the first year, fiscal year 2005, an \nopen enrollment period will be held to allow new enrollees to sign up \nfor the program in order to reduce retired pay outlays by increasing \ndeductions of SBP premiums from retired pay, thus offsetting part of \nthe cost of the survivor benefit increase.\n  Beginning on Oct. 1, 2005, the age-62 SBP annuity would increase to \n40 percent of retired pay, followed by additional increases to 45 \npercent on April 1, 2006, 50 percent on April 1, 2007 and 55 percent on \nApril 1, 2008 after which all survivors would receive the 55 percent of \nthe annuity.\n  Once again, I ask my colleagues to support our Nation's military \nwidows and widowers. In the National Defense Authorization Act of 2001, \nwe included a Sense of the Congress on increasing the military SBP \nannuity. This year, we have a chance to carry out this intent by \nenacting this important measure, and I ask my colleagues to join with \nme in support of this legislation.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I think we are ready to do a package of \namendments, if I could get the attention of the ranking member.\n\n\n    Amendments Nos. 3414, As Modified; 3280, As Modified; 3355, As \n    Modified; 3220; 3373, As Modified; 3459, As Modified; 3311, As \nModified; 3476; 3477; 3478; 3479; 3480; 3481; 3342, As Modified; 3482; \n                             3483; and 3484\n\n  Mr. President, I send a series of amendments to the desk which have \nbeen cleared by myself and the ranking member. Therefore, I ask \nunanimous consent that the Senate consider those amendments en bloc, \nthe amendments be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table. Finally, I ask unanimous consent that any statements \nrelating to any of these individual amendments be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments were agreed to, as follows:\n\n\n                    amendment no. 3414, as modified\n\n       At the end of title XI, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1107. REPORT ON HOW TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN INDIVIDUALS \n                   WITH FOREIGN LANGUAGE SKILLS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Federal Government has a requirement to ensure that \n     the employees of its departments and agencies with national \n     security responsibilities are prepared to meet the challenges \n     of this evolving international environment.\n       (2) According to a 2002 General Accounting Office report, \n     Federal agencies have shortages in translators and \n     interpreters and an overall shortfall in the language \n     proficiency levels needed to carry out their missions\n\n[[Page S7271]]\n\n     which has adversely affected agency operations and hindered \n     United States military, law enforcement, intelligence, \n     counterterrorism, and diplomatic efforts.\n       (3) Foreign language skills and area expertise are integral \n     to, or directly support, every foreign intelligence \n     discipline and are essential factors in national security \n     readiness, information superiority, and coalition \n     peacekeeping or warfighting missions.\n       (4) Communicating in languages other than English and \n     understanding and accepting cultural and societal differences \n     are vital to the success of peacetime and wartime military \n     and intelligence activities.\n       (5) Proficiency levels required for foreign language \n     support to national security functions have been raised, and \n     what was once considered proficiency is no longer the case. \n     The ability to comprehend and articulate technical and \n     complex information in foreign languages has become critical.\n       (6) According to the Joint Intelligence Committee Inquiry \n     into the 9/11 Terrorist Attacks, the Intelligence Community \n     had insufficient linguists prior to September 11, 2001, to \n     handle the challenge it faced in translating the volumes of \n     foreign language counterterrorism intelligence it collected. \n     Agencies within the Intelligence Community experienced \n     backlogs in material awaiting translation, a shortage of \n     language specialists and language-qualified field officers, \n     and a readiness level of only 30 percent in the most critical \n     terrorism-related languages that are used by terrorists.\n       (7) Because of this shortage, the Federal Government has \n     had to enter into private contracts to procure linguist and \n     translator services, including in some positions that would \n     be more appropriately filled by permanent Federal employees \n     or members of the United States Armed Forces.\n       (b) Report.--In its fiscal year 2006 budget request, the \n     Secretary of Defense shall submit to the Committees on Armed \n     Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives and \n     the Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate and the \n     Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of \n     Representatives, a plan for expanding and improving the \n     national security foreign language workforce of the \n     Department of Defense as appropriate to improve recruitment \n     and retention to meet the requirements of the Department for \n     its foreign language workforce on a short-term basis and on a \n     long-term basis.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3280\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  .

Mr. President, I am pleased to support this amendment, \nwhich I have cosponsored with the Senator from Oklahoma, to extend the \nEnergy Savings Performance Contract program through the end of fiscal \nyear 2005.\n  Our amendment is urgently needed to stem the damage being done to a \nvery successful program that brings private sector expertise, and \nprivate sector financing, to efficiency projects that reduce the \nFederal Government's energy use, and energy costs.\n  Since the 1970's Federal Government agencies have been setting an \nexample for the Nation on how to reduce energy waste and save money by \nimproving their energy efficiency--spending $2.3 billion less for \nenergy in FY2000 than in FY1985. One of the reasons for this success is \nthe availability of Energy Savings Performance contracts, ESPCs. These \ncontracts offer a way to make energy savings improvements at Federal \nfacilities at no cost to the Government, by leveraging private capital. \nThe Department of Defense has been a leader in the use of Energy \nSavings Performance contracts.\n  Under the ESPC authority enacted in 1992, private sector companies \nenter into contracts with Federal agencies to install energy savings \nequipment and make operational and maintenance changes to improve \nbuilding efficiency. The company pays all of the up-front costs for \nmaking the energy efficiency improvements and guarantees the agency \nsavings through the term of contract. The energy service company then \nrecovers its investment, over time, by receiving a portion of the \nagency's energy cost savings.\n  Since 1992, this program has brought nearly $1.1 billion in private \nsector investments to Federal agencies, resulting in hundreds of \nmillions of dollars in permanent savings to the taxpayers. The ESPC \nprogram has the support of a broad and diverse coalition of businesses, \nenvironmental groups and labor--including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, \nU.S. PIRG, and the Teamsters.\n  Unfortunately, the statutory authority for the ESPC program expired \nat the end of FY2003. As a result of the program lapse, over $300 \nmillion in energy efficiency projects have been halted nationwide. \nPending contacts are in limbo along with over 3,000 new jobs associated \nwith these projects. Although I and others have made several efforts to \nextend the program, these efforts have been unsuccessful, primarily \nbecause the Congressional Budget Office assigns a cost to the program, \nunlike the Office of Management and Budget which considers the program \nto be budget neutral.\n\n  While the debate over proper scoring of the program goes on, the loss \nof new business and experienced personnel has put this program into \ncrisis. With each passing week, the benefits and potential of ESPCs are \nbleeding away. At a time of high energy costs, high deficits, and high \nunemployment, Congress should act as soon as possible to extend ESPC \nauthority.\n  I thank the managers of the bill for accepting this short-term \nextension amendment. I also pledge to continue working with Senator \nInhofe and other supporters of the ESPC program to enact a permanent \nextension of this valuable efficiency program.\n\n[[Page S7274]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from Secretary Abraham \nexpressing administration support for the ESPC Program be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                      The Secretary of Energy,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 8, 2004.\n     Hon. Pete Domenici,\n     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Administration strongly supports \n     enactment, as soon as possible, of legislation to extend the \n     authority for Federal agencies to enter into Energy Savings \n     Performance Contracts (ESPCs).\n       Congress established the ESPC program in 1992 as an \n     innovative way to improve the Government's energy efficiency \n     by harnessing private-sector resources to fund necessary \n     energy-efficient improvements. However, authority to enter \n     into new ESPC contracts expired on October 1, 2003. A short-\n     term, one-year reauthorization would allow Federal agencies \n     to continue making investments in energy efficiency that save \n     energy and money and help agencies meet Federal energy \n     conservation goals.\n       The Administration continues to support long-term \n     reauthorization of the ESPC program as part of the \n     comprehensive energy legislation currently under \n     consideration in Congress. The legislation itself extending \n     ESPC authority is considered budget neutral and does not \n     require additional resources, as the Office of Management and \n     Budget classifies all budget authority and outlays for ESPCs \n     as absorbing discretionary resources. However, ESPCs actually \n     save the government money, because the upfront costs of ESPC \n     efficiency improvements are recovered through the energy \n     savings that result. Moreover, payments to the contractors \n     are contingent upon realizing a guaranteed stream of future \n     cost savings.\n       Improved energy efficiency and conservation of Federal \n     facilities is an important component of this Administration's \n     commitment to the cost-effective use of public dollars and \n     protection of the environment. The Administration urges \n     Congress to act quickly to extend the authorization of this \n     important program.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Spencer Abraham.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am prepared to enter into a unanimous \nconsent agreement with the distinguished Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all pending amendments be \nwithdrawn, with the exception of the following: Daschle, No. 3409, as \namended; Leahy, No. 3387, which will have a second degree by Senator \nLeahy or designee; and a series of amendments which have been cleared \nby both managers; I further ask consent that at 9:30 tonight the Senate \nproceed to a vote in relation to the Daschle amendment No. 3409, with \nno second degrees in order to the amendment prior to the vote; provided \nfurther that following the disposition of the Daschle amendment, the \nSenate vote in relation to the Leahy amendment No. 3387. I further ask \nconsent that following the disposition of the Leahy amendment, and the \ndisposition of the cleared amendments, the bill be read a third time \nand the Senate proceed to a vote on passage of the bill, with no \nintervening action or debate.\n  Before the Chair rules, I ask unanimous consent that the votes occur \nin reverse order than listed above.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding that, first of all, \nit will be the Daschle amendment No. 3409, as amended.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct. If I failed to read it, it is as \namended.\n  Mr. REID. And that the Leahy amendment No. 3387--we all know Senator \nLeahy is going to offer a second-degree amendment to the underlying \namendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct. It is in the script.\n  Mr. REID. And also, I say to the Senator, I want to make sure we \nwould have the Daschle vote second and the Leahy vote first.\n  Mr. WARNER. If that is the preference, so granted.\n  Mr. REID. That would be for the convenience of the Democratic leader. \nI would also think it would be appropriate to have 2 minutes evenly \ndivided prior to each vote. I would ask unanimous consent that the \ndistinguished chairman of the committee allow the modification of his \nunanimous consent request as I have outlined it.\n  Mr. WARNER. I concur in the modification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield, not to speak on my \namendment but to call it up and offer the second degree now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Daschle second degree \nNo. 3468 is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3468) was agreed to.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3485 To Amendment No. 3387\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask that amendment No. 3387 be called up, \nand I send to the desk a second-degree amendment on behalf of myself \nand Mr. Corzine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the second-degree \namendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Leahy], for himself and Mr. \n     Corzine, proposes an amendment numbered 3485 to amendment No. \n     3387.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To direct the Attorney General to submit to the Committee on \n  the Judiciary of the Senate all documents in the possession of the \n Department of Justice relating to the treatment and interrogation of \n         individuals held in the custody of the United States)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. REQUEST FOR DOCUMENTS AND RECORDS.\n\n       The Attorney General shall submit to the Committee on the \n     Judiciary of the Senate all documents and records produced \n     from January 20, 2001, to the present, and in the possession \n     of the Department of Justice, describing, referring or \n     relating to the treatment or interrogation of prisoners of \n     war, enemy combatants, and individuals held in the custody or \n     under the physical control of the United States Government or \n     an agent of the United States Government in connection with \n     investigations or interrogations by the military, the Central \n     Intelligence Agency, intelligence, antiterrorist or \n     counterterrorist offices in other agencies, or cooperating \n     governments, and the agents or contractors of such agencies \n     or governments.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the distinguished manager and yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, as the debate on the Defense \nauthorization bill began, I announced my intention to offer an \namendment to that bill with respect to the nuclear penetrator, or, as \nit is known around here, the RNEP. I have been dissuaded from offering \nthat amendment by the arguments of some of my friends who insist it is \nunnecessary because it would be simply a statement of existing law. I \nwanted to be sure that was the case, and therefore I sought assurances \nfrom both the Department of Energy and the Department of Defense. I \nhave handed the letters from those two Departments to my friend from \nMichigan. I ask if I could reclaim those letters so I might quote from \nthem.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is a fair request.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Linton F. Brooks, who is the Administrator of the \nNational Nuclear Security Administration, wrote me on June 15, and he \nsays the following things:\n\n     . . . let me state unequivocally this Administration has no \n     current plans or requirements to conduct an underground \n     nuclear test.\n\n  That is important to understand, that the administration has no plans \nto conduct an underground nuclear test of any kind.\n  With respect to RNEP, he says:\n\n     . . . I know you are concerned that the ongoing RNEP study \n     could lead to the resumption of underground nuclear testing. \n     The RNEP study will not require an underground nuclear test.\n\n  That is a very firm, unequivocal statement.\n  He goes on to talk about possibilities, and he says:\n\n       Should the President support, and the Congress approve, \n     full-scale engineering development of RNEP, the \n     Administration does not intend to conduct a nuclear test. \n     From the beginning, we have operated under the assumption \n     that resuming testing to certify RNEP is not an option. . . .\n\n\n[[Page S7275]]\n\n\n  Those are firm assurances from the Department of Energy. But I wanted \nto be sure this was not just Ambassador Linton Brooks' attitude, so I \nhad a conversation with Paul Wolfowitz at the Department of Defense. \nDated June 23, he sent me a letter reaffirming what Administrator \nBrooks had said and makes it clear that the Department of Defense \nagrees there will be no nuclear test with respect to RNEP under the \ncurrent administration.\n  So I am heartened by these assurances I have received from the \nDepartment of Defense and the Department of Energy that there is no \nplan or requirement to conduct an underground nuclear explosive test of \nany kind, and I accept these assurances. But here in the Congress I \nhave those to whom I look for guidance on these matters. I want to be \nsure that should some future administration decide to change the policy \nthat has been outlined by the Bush administration, that the present law \nwould hinder future administrations from conducting these same tests \nwithout there being a vote of Congress; particularly with respect to \nRNEP, that there would be no underground nuclear test without a \ncongressional vote.\n  I have asked the Senator from Arizona, who is an expert on these \nmatters, if he would agree. I also discussed it with the Senator from \nMichigan, who is the ranking member on the Armed Services Committee.\n  If I may, Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Arizona, Mr. Kyl, if \nhe agrees that under current law, a vote from Congress would have to \noccur before a test could be conducted on RNEP?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I answer the Senator from Utah, yes, I agree \nCongress would have to vote before a test could be conducted.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Senator from Arizona, Mr. President.\n  I would now like to address the same question to the Senator from \nMichigan, with his great background in the area of law concerning this.\n  Does the Senator from Michigan agree that under current law, a vote \nfrom Congress would have to occur before a test could be conducted for \nRNEP?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Yes. I, too, agree that Congress would have to vote before \na test could be conducted.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Senator from Michigan. I thank the Senator \nfrom Arizona.\n  On the basis of their assurances, along with the written assurances I \nhave received from this administration--two Departments speaking--I \nwill not offer my amendment.\n  Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent those two letters be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Department of Energy, National Nuclear Security \n           Administration,\n                                    Washington, DC, June 15, 2004.\n     Hon. Robert Bennett,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bennett: Thank you for taking the time to meet \n     with me on June 3, 2004, to discuss your concerns regarding \n     the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator (RNEP) study and \n     underground nuclear testing at the Nevada Test Site (NTS). I \n     appreciate your concerns and I hope to address them in this \n     letter.\n       First, let me state unequivocally this Administration has \n     no current plans or requirements to conduct an underground \n     nuclear test. The Stockpile Stewardship Program is working \n     today to ensure that America's nuclear deterrent is safe, \n     secure and reliable. Currently there are no issues of \n     sufficient concern to warrant a nuclear test. I certainly \n     understand the concerns you and your constituents in Utah \n     have with nuclear testing at the Nevada Test Site. However, I \n     believe it is critical to maintain a readiness capability at \n     the NTS to conduct such a test in the future if called for by \n     the President of the United States, in order to ensure the \n     safety and/or reliability of a weapon system. Therefore, I \n     believe it is important for us to work together to ensure \n     that the NNSA test readiness program continues to make safety \n     a top priority.\n       Furthermore, I know you are concerned that the ongoing RNEP \n     study could lead to the resumption of underground nuclear \n     testing. The RNEP study will not require an underground \n     nuclear test. Should the President support, and Congress \n     approve, full-scale engineering development of RNEP, the \n     Administration does not intend to conduct a nuclear test. \n     From the beginning, we have operated under the assumption \n     that resuming testing to certify RNEP is not an option and \n     for that reason, more than any other, the RNEP study is only \n     looking at two existing weapon systems, the B-61 and the B-\n     83. Both are well-proven systems with an extensive test \n     pedigree from the 1970s and 80s. I would be happy to work \n     with you and the Senate Armed Services Committee to address \n     your concerns on this sensitive matter.\n       If you have any further questions or concerns, please do \n     not hesitate to contact me or C. Anson Franklin, Director, \n     Office of Congressional, Intergovernmental and Public Affairs \n     at (202) 586-8343.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Linton F. Brooks,\n     Administrator.\n                                  ____\n\n                                      Deputy Secretary of Defense,\n                                    Washington, DC, June 23, 2004.\n     Hon. Robert Bennett,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bennett: I understand that you have concerns \n     about the Department's plans to study options for a Robust \n     Nuclear Earth Penetrator (RNEP) that would give the United \n     States the capability to threaten hardened, deeply buried \n     targets in hostile nations. Specifically, you have raised \n     concerns that the development of such a system could require \n     the resumption of underground nuclear testing.\n       I want to assure you that the Administration has no plans \n     to conduct an underground nuclear test associated with the \n     development of RNEP. As National Nuclear Security \n     Administration Administrator Linton Brooks recently wrote to \n     you, ``the RNEP study is only looking at two existing weapon \n     systems, the B-61 and B-83. Both are well-proven systems with \n     an extensive test pedigree from the 1970s and 80s.''\n       If RNEP were to move from its current study phase to \n     development, such plans would be part of the Administration's \n     annual budget request to Congress. The Administration's \n     intentions concerning underground nuclear testing during RNEP \n     development, if different from our current intentions, would \n     be explicit in that request. Congress would have the \n     opportunity at that time to debate and pass judgment on those \n     plans.\n       Thank you for the opportunity to address your concerns \n     about the Department's development of RNEP. If I can be of \n     further assistance, I hope you will let me know.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Paul Wolfowitz.\n\n\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/23/senate-section/article/S7275-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7275]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, JUNE 24, 2004\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, I wonder if I might engage the \ndistinguished Chairman in a brief colloquy.\n  Mr. WARNER. Certainly.\n  Mrs. DOLE. I thank my colleagues. Mr. President, as a member of the \nPersonnel Subcommittee, I am acutely sensitive to the enormous \nchallenges confronting our National Guard and Reserve forces, and their \nfamilies, as they are called upon to defend our Nation in the war on \nterrorism. North Carolina is at the forefront of National Guard and \nReserve mobilizations, with 31 percent of our State's 23,300 National \nGuard and Reserve members currently mobilized.\n  The University of North Carolina, in partnership with a wide range of \nuniversities and community organizations, is developing a National \nDemonstration Program for Citizen-Soldier Support to augment, \nstrengthen, and refine the existing framework of support for National \nGuard and Reserve personnel, and their families. The objectives of the \ndemonstration program are to strengthen communication and information \ndissemination; strengthen community support systems; strengthen support \nsystems for children and adolescents; strengthen health and mental \nhealth care systems; strengthen employment support networks; and \naddress proactively emerging issues of importance to our personnel and \ntheir families. This National Demonstration Program of Citizen-Soldier \nSupport has been presented to a wide variety of civilian and military \nleaders, and has been uniformly supported as timely, substantive, and \nhighly promising as an adjunct to existing Department of Defense \nprograms and services.\n  Unfortunately, as a relatively new initiative, this National \nDemonstration Program for Citizen-Soldier Support was not included as \npart of the President's budget request and was not authorized within \nthe bill now before the Senate. It is my understanding that the \ndecision to not include the National Demonstration Program for Citizen-\nSoldier Support in the FY05 Defense Authorization bill was not made \nwith prejudice to the program but, rather, was based on the emerging \nnature of the structure and deliverables associated with this program--\na program that is focusing on how to best assist our Reservists and \ntheir families in their newly emerging roles in the war on terror.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Senator from North Carolina is \ncorrect. At the time that the Armed Services Committee was preparing \nits mark, there was not sufficient data available concerning the \nspecific elements of the proposed program, and its interrelationship \nwith other existing and emerging programs within the Department, to \nfully assess the merits of the National Demonstration Program for \nCitizen-Soldier Support. The absence of this proposed program in the \nbill should not be interpreted as a negative assessment.\n  Mrs. DOLE. I thank the Chairman. I might also ask the Chairman if he \nwould agree with me that our Nation's security depends on the mission-\nreadiness and retention of our citizen-soldiers, and that for the total \nforce to function effectively, we must make certain that these men and \nwomen, their families, and employers have needed support while they \nprepare for, carry out, and eventually return from active military \nservice.\n  Mr. WARNER. I would agree wholeheartedly with the Senator from North \nCarolina's statement. At at time when we are relying more and more on \nour National Guard and Reserve forces to defend our national security, \nwe must continue to provide direct and substantive support to these \npersonnel and their families.\n  Mrs. DOLE. I thank the distinguished Chairman. Given this concurrence \non the importance of ensuring necessary and effective support for our \nNational Guard and Reserve families, I ask the Chairman if he would be \nwilling to support my effort to bring this proposed Demonstration \nProgram for Citizen-Soldier Support to the attention of the appropriate \nDepartment of Defense offices. This effort will require modifying \nelements of the proposed program, where appropriate, to maximize \nsynergies with ongoing Department of Defense initiatives and exploring \noptions within the defense budget for funding implementation of the \nprogram.\n  Mr. WARNER. I commend the distinguished Senator from North Carolina \nfor her steadfast advocacy for our men and women in uniform, and their \nfamilies, and I would be pleased to work with her on this important \nissue.\n  Mrs. DOLE. I thank the distinguished Chairman for his courtesy.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I wonder if I might take just a minute to \nask the Chairman whether I am correct that developing a reliable, \nautomated three-dimensional facial recognition capability has \nsignificant implications for our fight against terrorism and would be \nof great interest to the defense, intelligence and transportation \nsecurity agencies.\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes, that is certainly my understanding.\n  Mr. ALLEN. I also understand that one very promising approach would \nbe to use laser radar to acquire such a three-dimensional image. This \ntechnology is highly accurate, and is already used in industrial \napplications to measure such things as minute imperfections in airplane \nwings. Unlike more traditional photography, it also would work in a \ngreater variety of lighting\n\n[[Page S7278]]\n\nconditions and at a much greater distance. It also has the advantage of \navoiding allegations of racial profiling because it makes no use of \nskin color, instead measuring facial features.\n  Mr. WARNER. I understand that accuracy has been a problem with some \nsystems developed to date so new approaches would be welcomed.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Does the Chairman agree it would be worthwhile to explore \ntaking existing industrial technology and applying it to the problem of \nquickly and reliably identifying at a distance moving individuals at \nsuch locations as airports and border crossings?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes, I think that if there were funding for such a \ndevelopment project it offers the prospect of significant security \nbenefits.\n\n\n                                 AFRTS\n\n  Mr. WARNER. In discussions with my good friend and colleague, Senator \nInhofe, I have been made aware of the fact that questions have arisen \nabout the intent of amendment 3316 regarding the American Forces Radio \nand Television Service, or AFRTS, submitted by Senator Harkin. That \namendment to the pending legislation was accepted on June 14, 2004.\n  Mr. INHOFE. That is correct. Numerous concerns have been expressed \nfrom my home State, and, I believe, many other States, about this \namendment. There is a belief that this amendment is intended to be \ncritical of the AFRTS and the manner in which it makes current \nprogramming decisions regarding radio and television shows featuring \npolitical commentary.\n  Mr. WARNER. Thank you for offering me the opportunity to clarify this \npoint. In my view, the intent of this amendment was not to call into \nquestion the performance of the AFRTS. Indeed, as my staff and I \nexamined the proposed amendment originally submitted by Senator Harkin, \nwe saw that it called for the establishment of a Presidential Advisory \nBoard to examine the manner in which AFRTS carries out its mission and \nto submit recommendations on how the AFRTS should carry out \nprogramming. As we looked at the manner in which the Office of the \nSecretary of Defense for Public Affairs and AFRTS perform its mission, \nhowever, it became clear that the case had not been made that changes \nwere necessary or that such an Advisory Board was needed.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Is it correct to say, then, that this Harkin amendment \nexpressing the sense of the Senate was actually intended to be an \nexpression of support for the current approach of the Department of \nDefense to the AFRTS which provides programming representing a cross-\nsection of popular American radio and television offerings and \nemulating stateside programming seen and heard in the United States?\n  Mr. WARNER. Absolutely. The amendment cites word for word relevant \nportions of the current Department of Defense Directive concerning \nAFRTS, including a statement of the mission to be accomplished and the \nkey principles that should be followed in order to provide a free flow \nof political programming from U.S. commercial and public networks. The \namendment specifically states that the mission statement is \nappropriate. Recognizing that there are several hundred satellite \nstations or ``outlets'' around the globe at which programming decisions \nare made on a daily basis, the amendment goes on to recommend that the \nSecretary of Defense ensure that these important principles, which can \nbe summarized as fairness and balance in presenting shows on various \ntopics, including political commentary, are being accomplished.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Is it correct to say that those who make the programming \ndecision for AFRTS have an obligation to consider the popularity and \ndesirability of radio and television programming? In other words, \nshould the AFRTS take note of national commercial ratings as well as \nlocal and worldwide formal audience surveys as to what their audience \ndesires to see and hear on their AFRTS programming?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes. That would clearly be one factor among several that \nshould be considered, consistent with the goal of providing the same \ntype and quality of American radio and television news, information, \nand entertainment that would be available to military personnel and \ntheir families if they were in the continental United States. Other \nfactors should also be considered in achieving the AFRTS goals of \nfairness and balance in presenting all sides of important public \nquestions, and the amendment was intended to underscore the importance \nof those goals.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the chairman for that clarification.\n\n\n                           Air National Guard\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. I would like to take a moment to engage the Senator from \nMichigan in a discussion about information operations in the Air \nNational Guard. Before we begin, I would also like to thank my \ncolleague for his willingness to have this discussion on an issue of \ngreat importance to national security and to many of the Air National \nGuard personnel in my State.\n  Let me start by saying that I think most of my colleagues understand \nthat while the world today has changed, some things have stayed the \nsame. When you are trying to stop terrorists, just like organized \ncrime, you have to follow the money. These days, in order to follow the \nmoney, you have to have the very best in information operations skills. \nYou have to understand the computerized financial networks and security \nsystems used by financial institutions. In addition, you have to be \nable to protect your own information. This is a critical aspect of the \nwar on terrorism and one where the Government needs more capability.\n  Last year, the Defense Authorization Conference Report provided 30 \nadditional Air Guard personnel that we had hoped would be used to stand \nup a new unit in Delaware to do this mission. This year, Senator Carper \nand I had hoped to finish that work by providing a total of 60 \npersonnel for that unit. Unfortunately, we are not able to do that \nbecause the Department of Defense has not evaluated this proposal to \ndetermine whether it is a mission that should be assigned to the Air \nNational Guard.\n  We understand that the Department of Defense has an established \nprocess for assigning missions and determining the manning necessary to \nsupport those missions. Expanding the information operations capability \nof a unit or units within the Air National Guard has not been \nconsidered through this process.\n  Mr. LEVIN. My colleague from Delaware is correct. The Department of \nDefense has a rigorous process for determining whether a new mission \nshould be assumed as a military mission and that expansion of the \ninformation operations capability of the Air National Guard has not \nbeen considered by this process. Additionally, the Department of \nDefense is conducting a complete review of the Guard's roles and \nmissions right now.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I hope that we can agree that the Department's review \nshould include an examination of using the Air National Guard for \nemerging missions like information operations.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I can commit to the Senator from Delaware that I will do \nall that I can to ensure that this area is included in the Department's \nreview and given full consideration.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. I also hope that we will have their input regarding the \nmission and its suitability for the Air Guard before we take up next \nyear's Defense Authorization bill. I would also like to make sure that \nthe consideration of this particular mission takes into account the \nunique skills present in the Delaware Air National Guard and the work \nthat they have already done in this area.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Again, I commit to my colleague that we will work with him \nand the Department of Defense to get that thorough and timely \nconsideration.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank my colleague for those assurances and look forward \nto working with him over the next year to make sure our information \noperations needs are met.\n  Now, let me explain why I think it is so important to stand this unit \nup in Delaware.\n  Delaware is uniquely situated to provide the skills needed for \ninformation assurance and financial tracking. Delaware is host to 7 of \nthe top 10 banking institutions in the U.S. Delaware also has the \nhighest amount of computer networking per capita of any State. In \naddition, major research companies like DuPont and Astra-Zeneca make \ntheir headquarters in Delaware. Last, Delaware has the highest number \nof\n\n[[Page S7279]]\n\nscientists and engineers per capita in the U.S.\n  All of those statistics mean that many members of Delaware's Air \nNational Guard have civilian employment in banks or other institutions. \nThey understand what is required to protect financial information and \nto track it. They are on the cutting-edge of information protection \ntoday.\n  Their skills cannot be used by the Government, however, because banks \nand financial institutions are very sensitive about the employees of \nother banks reviewing their financial transactions. To do this type of \nwork, a person must be a Government employee. One of the best ways to \nprovide the benefit of these private sector skills to Government \nagencies fighting terror is through the National Guard. Guard personnel \nstay on the cutting edge of these skills because of their private \nsector jobs. They can then provide that knowledge to the Government, \nsomething that a civilian government employee cannot do.\n  In 2003, the National Security Agency and the Air Intelligence Agency \nrecognized their shortfalls in information assurance and tracking \nskills and started asking some of these Delaware Guardsmen and women to \nhelp them meet their requirements. NSA will have spent $945,000 between \n2003 and 2004 to make use of the Delaware Air Guard's expertise. They \nwould like to spend an additional $900,000 in 2005. AIA is spending \n$150,000 in 2004 on these missions. They are spending this money \nbecause a real need exists.\n  Last year, the Senate, and then the full Congress, agreed that this \nmission needed support and a full-time unit. Thirty personnel were \nadded to the Air National Guard's end-strength to create this new \ninformation operations unit. This year, we had hoped to finish the job \nby providing the full complement of 60 personnel needed for the mission \nand the $3.997 million needed to fully fund this unit. That is $2.75 \nmillion for personnel costs and $1.247 million for operations and \nmaintenance. Unfortunately that will not be possible.\n  Some may wonder why we sought an amendment to add the personnel and \nfunding needed. The reason is simple. The Delaware Air National Guard \nis too small to move people to this mission and still do their primary \ntactical airlift mission. The 166th tactical airlift wing has had its \nC-130s fully tasked to support operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. When \nI wrote Lieutenant General James at the Guard Bureau about standing up \nthis new unit, he replied that he thought Delaware's Guard was well-\npostured for the mission, but his ``end strength cap makes it \nchallenging to resource new initiatives.'' Our amendment would have \ntaken care of that challenge.\n  Up to now, the personnel who have been working with NSA and AIA so \nfar have been working three jobs. Let me say that again, three jobs. It \nis simply not sustainable. They cannot continue to do their regular Air \nGuard mission in the 166th tactical airlift wing, their civilian job, \nand the third job of helping NSA and AIA. With a new unit, we can \nprovide the critical information operations skills needed to fight \nterrorism without harming the on-going tactical airlift mission that is \nsupporting troops in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n  I know end strength increases are controversial, but we need to look \nat the big picture. Remember, Congress agreed that a new unit was \nneeded to do these missions last year. The facts on the ground have not \nchanged. This is exactly the type of new mission the Air Guard should \nbe doing. Only with the Guard can you get the commercial expertise and \ncutting edge knowledge needed to protect information systems and to \ntrack financial transactions. I look forward to hearing the Pentagon's \nthoughts about this new mission.\n  Again, I think it's important to stress that information assurance \nand financial information operations are critical to the war on \nterrorism and to a transformed military. This is a growing area, not a \nshrinking one. We have looked carefully at all of our opportunities to \nprovide the needed highly-skilled personnel to the fight. It is my \nbelief that we can only do this if we create a unit to take advantage \nof the experienced and knowledgeable personnel available. No matter how \npatriotic people are, they cannot continue to work three jobs for years \non end. Creating the new 166th information operations unit in the \nDelaware Air National Guard will enhance national security. It was the \nright thing to do last year and it's still the right thing to do. I \nhope that the Air Force will recognize that as we move forward in the \nwar on terrorism.\n\n\n                               JOINTSTARS\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the heavily \ntasked, high value asset of the E-8C JointSTARS fleet, which provides \nreal-time surveillance and targeting for our armed forces. This \ncritical asset, operated by an integrated wing located in my home State \nof Georgia, has worldwide commitments and is essential to the effective \nexecution of the combined air-land strategy and tactics for our forces. \nHowever, the current engines do not provide sufficient power for the E-\n8C JointSTARS fleet to meet all of its operational requirements.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator from Georgia is quite correct in his \nobservation and assessment and our committee has urged the Department \nto move forward with its economic analysis of engine alternatives for \nthis critical fleet of aircraft. The Senator from Georgia should be \nproud of the 116th wing of the Georgia Air National Guard, as the work \nthat this integrated wing performs on a daily basis is responsible for \nsaving many soldiers' lives. As he stated, the E-8C JointSTARS fleet \nprovides critical airborne battle management command and control.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. As the chairman has mentioned, the conference report \non the fiscal year 2004 National Defense Authorization Act required the \nSecretary of Defense to submit a report to the congressional defense \ncommittees providing an economic analysis comparing the options of \nmaintaining the current engines on the E-8C JointSTARS aircraft, \npurchasing and installing new engines, and leasing and installing new \nengines. This report was to have been submitted by February 13, 2004, \nbut has yet to be received.\n  The engines that currently power the E-8C JointSTARS aircraft fleet \nare the same engines we have gone to great lengths to replace over the \nlast decade in the Air Force's tanker fleet. The engines are old, \nprovide marginal power to support the E-8C's taskings, and are \nexpensive to operate and maintain compared to new engines currently \navailable in the commercial market. These are not just my observations. \nLet me quote from a recent memorandum from the Vice Commander of Air \nCombat Command to the Air Force Vice Chief of Staff:\n\n       This letter provides a brief update on our efforts to re-\n     engine JSTARS, which continues to be one of our top \n     initiatives for the E-8. The current TF-33-102C engines do \n     not satisfy desired safety margins or meet operational needs. \n     An Air Force Flight Standards Agency critical field length \n     waiver is required to support takeoffs with current engines. \n     Additionally, Operations ALLIED FORCE, ENDURING FREEDOM, AND \n     IRAQI FREEDOM highlighted significant JSTARS engine \n     performance shortfalls. A lack of thrust and fuel efficiency \n     combined to reduce mission operating altitudes and on-station \n     times. The current TF33 engines are the number one driver of \n     the Non-Mission Capable for Maintenance rate and are the \n     leading cause of sortie aborts and code-3 landings. It is \n     projected that re-engining will reduce the NMCM rate by 10 \n     percent and positively increase the overall system Mission \n     Capable rates by four percent. E-8C crews have also \n     experienced several instances of engine over temps on \n     takeoffs, which have mandated reduced thrust takeoffs. Re-\n     engining JSTARS makes sense operationally and from a \n     sustainability perspective.\n\n  We have included language in the report accompanying this bill that \nstates should the Secretary of Defense recommend in his report that a \nre-engining program be pursued for the E-8C, the committee encourages \nthe Air Force to initiate this program, taking into account the \nrecommendations of the Secretary's report on how best to implement it. \nI am optimistic that the Air Force report will be delivered to the \ncommittee in the near term. I am hopeful that as our bill moves from \nfloor consideration and to conference with the House, we can work to \nensure that this re-engine initiative is given every consideration \nbased on the data and analysis provided for our consideration.\n  There are many aspects to consider in taking care of our soldiers, \nsailors, airmen and marines who are sent into harm's way. In times like \nthese, preserving the assets that help to ensure the well-being of our \nmen and women\n\n[[Page S7280]]\n\nin uniform should be given the investment necessary to see that the \nequipment is the best that we can provide and at the best value for our \narmed forces.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator from Georgia for his leadership on \nthis issue, and I look forward to working with him on this important \nissue.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. We owe it to the men and women who crew the E-8C \nJointSTARS to ensure that these aircraft are powered by engines that \nprovide desired safety margins and on-station operating times that \naccomplish the aircraft's mission without degradation. At the same time \nwe owe it to the taxpayers of this Nation to ensure that these aircraft \nare powered by engines that are fuel efficient and supportable for our \narmed forces.\n\n\n                          competitive sourcing\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to engage \nwith the distinguished Senator from Virginia regarding some of the \nmeasures included in this very important bill. First, I want to commend \nthe Senator from Virginia for his tireless efforts in managing this \nbill. He is always very fair and considerate, and his outstanding \nleadership is appreciated.\n   Mr. President, I am concerned that some amendments adopted by \nUnanimous Consent may have a negative impact on the President's \nCompetitive Sourcing Initiative, and ultimately adversely impact the \nPresident's ability to administer the bureaucracy of the Department of \nDefense. As a longtime supporter of a more accountable and responsible \nfederal government, I strongly support President Bush's competitive \nsourcing initiative which seeks to improve the way federal agencies \noperate. However, I recognize how critical it is in these times of war \nthat we move this bill quickly and not allow it to be held up further \nby partisan politics. So I do not object to accepting these measures in \nthe larger interest of getting a Defense bill through the Senate.\n  Every president for the last 50 years, Republican and Democrat alike, \nhas endorsed the elimination of commercial functions in the federal \nworkforce, but their plans were not vigorously implemented or enforced. \nAs a result, nearly half of today's civilian federal workforce is doing \nwork that could be done more efficiently by the private sector.\n  Mr. WARNER. I believe we looked to remedy this with the FAIR Act in \n1998. Am I not correct in stating that this law basically says that \nfederal agencies should inventory government services that are \ncommercial in nature, and then review whether these activities should \ncontinue to be performed in the public sector?\n  Mr. THOMAS. That's correct. The Clinton Administration did the first \ninventory and found that more than 850,000 Federal employees out of 1.8 \nmillion were in jobs that were commercial in nature. The federal \ngovernment was paying individuals to do jobs that could also be found \nin the Yellow Pages. Unfortunately, the Clinton Administration did not \nfollow up. These positions should have been reviewed and solutions \nexplored to return these jobs to where they belonged--the private \nsector. Unfortunately, there were no follow up reviews. It was only \nwhen George W. Bush was elected that a program was implemented to \nactually do the reviews of these 850,000 positions. Competitive \nsourcing could then be employed to see if it would be more effective \nand accountable to have these activities performed by the private \nsector.\n  Contrary to misinformation by some of our colleagues and labor \nunions, competitive sourcing is not about eliminating or privatizing \nfederal workers. Simply put, competitive sourcing, which relies on the \nA-76 Circular for public-private competitions, is a useful tool that \nallows federal agencies to evaluate whether or not commercial functions \nshould be performed in the future by federal employees or the private \nsector. As it is now, many federal employees who work in commercial \nfunctions are stuck in inefficient bureaucracies performing activities \nthat are non-inherently governmental.\n  The competitive sourcing process is good government. As numerous \nindependent reports to Congress have shown, competitive sourcing saves \ntaxpayers between 10 to 40 percent--regardless of who wins. The record \nis that every position reviewed by competitive sourcing shows savings \nregardless of whether that position stays in-house or gets contracted. \nFederal employees win an overwhelming majority of the competitions. But \nclearly, the taxpayer is the real winner in this process. Inefficient \nmonopolies that waste taxpayer dollars and divert much-needed federal \nresources from our government's most pressing programs should always be \nexamined. There are activities which are inherently governmental, and \nshould be performed by the government. No one would argue this. \nHowever, government should not be engaged in activities which are \nalready offered in the private sector. As we look for ways to reduce \nits size, cost and scope, we need always remember that government \nshould be the provider of last resort with the free enterprise system \nbeing the provider of the first choice. To do otherwise is a disservice \nto the American taxpayer. Would the Senator from Virginia agree with \nus?\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I certainly agree with my friend from \nWyoming that we should continue to evaluate the way the federal \ngovernment operates. Competitive sourcing is an important tool \navailable to the government to ensure that high quality governmental \nservices are acquired at the lowest cost to the taxpayer.\n  I believe the Senator wanted to share some of his concerns with an \namendment offered by the Senator from Massachusetts and the Senator \nfrom Georgia.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I do. The amendment offered by Senators Kennedy and \nChambliss would all but eliminate use of the streamlined process \ncontemplated under the revised Office of Management and Budget Circular \nA-76. This process applies to competitions of 65 or fewer full-time \nequivalents. By making the use of A-76 competitions arbitrary, as \nopposed to strategic, the Department of Defense's necessary flexibility \nin procurement is removed. The amendment also includes provisions \ndesigned to give in-house employees unfair advantages over the private \nsector in the competitive sourcing process and makes it difficult for \nsmall businesses to be competitive in job contests.\n  Unfortunately, with the country at war, I'm afraid that these \nmeasures would be very counterproductive, costly, and present \nunnecessary hurdles for the Department in this very crucial period of \ntime. In fact, the Administration, in a statement of administration \npolicy issued by OMB, has declared its opposition to any final defense \nmeasure that limits DOD's competitive sourcing flexibility. The White \nHouse has, in fact, threatened to veto this bill if it contained these \nprovisions. I am sure the distinguished Senator from Virginia is well \naware of the importance the President places on this issue.\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes, I am. I certainly understand the Senator's concerns, \nand I can tell him that I am hopeful that as we move forward and \nreconcile this very important bill with that of the House in \nconference, we will take a very careful look at these measures and work \nout acceptable language that will not burden the DOD or hamper the \nPresident in his role as administrator of the federal bureaucracy in \nthese critical times.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I think it is very important that we revisit these \nproposals. In the interest of moving this defense bill in a time of \nwar, we have forgone an important debate. So I thank the Chairman for \nhis attention to this matter and again say to him that I appreciate his \nstrong leadership.\n\n\n                  Manufacturing Extension Partnership\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, Senator Reed and I filed an amendment to \nensure the soundness of our Nation's defense supply chains through the \nsupport of the Manufacturing Extension Partnership, MEP, Centers. We \nwould like to thank our colleagues, Senators Warner, Levin, Gregg, \nHollings and McCain for accepting the modified amendment. Senator Reed \nand my amendment clarifies that the Department of Commerce has the \nability to transfer and reprogram $21.8 million to the MEP Program in \nfiscal year 2004.\n  The vitality and viability of our Nation's small manufacturers has \ntremendous consequences for our Nation. Without a strong manufacturing \nbase, we risk losing wealth for our Nation,\n\n[[Page S7281]]\n\nwe risk good jobs for our citizens, and we risk irreparably harming our \nNation's defense supply base at a critical time.\n  The MEP assists America's small manufacturers and helps boost \nproductivity, sales, investment in modernization, and employment. I \nhave a very simple, but vital, message to deliver--manufacturing \nmatters--MEP matters. But I am worried that President Bush does not \nunderstand this simple message. This fiscal year 2004, the \nadministration's budget slashed the MEP Program by 88 percent. Due to \nthe efforts of Senators Gregg and Hollings, the Senate fiscal 2004 \nappropriations bill restored funding for the program to $106 million. \nHowever, the Omnibus Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2004 reduced \nthat level to only $39.6 million.\n  As a Federal-State-private partnership, MEP is a network of over 60 \ncenters with 400 locations across the country and Puerto Rico providing \ntechnical assistance and business support services to small \nmanufacturers. These not-for-profit centers employ more than 2,000 \nprofessionals who work with manufacturers to help them adopt and use \nthe latest and most efficient technologies, processes, and business \npractices. As a result, our small manufacturers are better able to \ncompete with low wage countries, maintain jobs in America, and continue \ndriving a higher standard of living in the U.S. In fiscal year 2002, \nMEP's clients reported sales of $2.8 billion, 35,000 new or retained \nworkers, $681 million in cost savings, and $941 million invested in new \nplant and equipment as a direct result of their MEP projects.\n  However, funding constraints and budget cuts have forced every MEP \nCenter in the country to downsize. According to a recent Modernization \nForum survey, MEP Centers have closed 58 regional offices and reduced \nstaffing by 15 percent, which will leave small manufacturers across the \ncountry without the invaluable technical and business assistance that \nhelps them remain competitive edge in the global marketplace.\n  Senator Reed's and my amendment will help address this issue by \nclarifying that the Secretary of Commerce can reprogram $21.8 million \nto the MEP Program this year. Fifty-five Senators requested that the \nSecretary reprogram funding to the MEP Centers this year. \nUnfortunately, the Department refused this request; leaving the MEP \nCenters and small manufacturers without the resources they need. In a \nresponse to the Senate request for reprogramming, Secretary Evans \nimplied that the Department of Commerce does not consider it worthwhile \nto reprogram funding to the MEP program because the appropriations act \nwould only allow the transfer and reprogramming of $3.9 million. In \ndiscussions with the Appropriations Committee and the Congressional \nResearch Service, however, this appears to be a very narrow reading of \nthe statute by the Department of Commerce. The appropriate level of \nfunding that can, and should, be transferred and reprogrammed is $21.8 \nmillion. This amendment clarifies that level of funding for transfer \nand reprogramming.\n  The administration needs to make resources available to help our \nNation's small manufacturers. That is why I, along with my colleague \nSenator Reed, continue to call on the administration to reprogram $21.8 \nmillion to support the MEP Centers this year. And we call on the \nadministration to send a Budget Amendment to Congress to support \n$106.9M for the MEP Program in fiscal 2005.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues Senators Warner, \nLevin, Gregg, Hollings and McCain for working with Senator Kohl and I \non this important amendment preserving the Manufacturing Extension \nPartnership, MEP, Program. I particularly want to thank Senators \nHollings and Gregg for their strong support of the MEP Program and \ntheir efforts to restore funding to a program that is vital to our \nNation's small manufacturers. I look forward to working with them this \nyear to ensure funding is restored in fiscal year 2005.\n  Senator Kohl and my amendment clarifies that the Secretary of \nCommerce has the ability to transfer and reprogram $21.8 million to the \nMEP Program this fiscal year in order to assist our nation's small \nmanufacturers. Senator Gregg, Hollings, Kohl and I believe that the \nSecretary already has the ability to transfer and reprogram this \nfunding; however, rather than honor the request of 55 Senators and work \nwith the Senate and Congress to help reprogram funds, the Department of \nCommerce has chosen to hide behind a legal interpretation that it lacks \nsuch authority.\n  Small manufacturers have a direct impact on national security. Small \nmanufacturers are the backbone of our defense production capacities. \nFirms with fewer than 500 employees comprise more than 80 percent of \nthe defense supply chains. Small businesses are responsible for a \nsignificant share of defense contracting. They receive 21 percent of \nprime contracts and 41 percent of the subcontracts awarded to \nbusinesses by, or on behalf of, the Department of Defense.\n  The National Coalition for Advanced Manufacturing in a 2002 report \nidentified five key challenges that confront the defense industrial \nbase. First, the loss of small and medium-sized firms that participate \nin the defense supply chain is taking its toll on our Nation's defense \nreadiness as many makers of components and spare parts for the larger \ndefense contractors have left the marketplace or are ill-prepared to \nrespond to swift increases in orders. There is no known source of \nsupply for over 11,000 products used by the Department of Defense. \nSecond, our Nation needs to maintain sufficient surge production \ncapacity to meet unanticipated national defense needs. The production \nof platform systems, components and munitions is constrained by the \nsurge capacity of prime contractors and the capabilities of the \nsupplier base. Being able to provide for these defense needs is vital \nto our military. Third, outdated and aging manufacturing systems and \nprocesses are involved in the production of major weapon systems. The \nneed for quality and technology improvements along with increased \nproductivity and cost reduction makes the shortage of capable small \nmanufacturers more problematic. Fourth, large defense companies often \nhave the knowledge and resources to make investments in productivity \nand efficiency improvements; however, small manufacturers frequently \nlack the necessary technical knowledge, staff and resources to take \nadvantage of new techniques and technology. Lastly, to increase \nparticipation in defense production, small manufacturers need \nassistance adapting commercial production practices and techniques to \nthe needs of the defense industrial base.\n  The MEP program can help our Nation address these challenges. MEP \nCenters have a strong track record of solving supply management issues. \nMEP helps preserve and strengthen domestic production of unique defense \ntechnologies and provides a strong strategic edge over threats to \nnational security. MEP is active within U.S. defense supply chains \nassisting small sub-tier suppliers to cut costs, boost productivity, \nintegrate technology and accelerate delivery times. Officials from \nBoeing, General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, and \nRaytheon expressed their reliance on MEP for cost and quality \nimprovements at small manufacturing firms on which they rely for \ncomponent parts and assemblies.\n  To date, the actions of the Department of Commerce have been \nunacceptable. The administration needs to make resources available to \nhelp our Nation's small manufacturers. The administration should \nimmediately reprogram $21.8 million to support the MEP Centers this \nyear as directed by Senator Kohl and my amendment. Given the broad \nbipartisan and national support for this program, the administration \nshould send a Budget Amendment to Congress to support $106.9M for the \nMEP program in fiscal 2005.\n\n\n                           fuel cell program\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I wonder if I might discuss an important \nmatter with the Chairman of the Armed Services Committee regarding the \nprogram to advance fuel cell technology for support of armed forces.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would be happy to discuss this issue \nwith the Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, the Senate report accompanying National \nDefense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005 included language on a \nprogram to\n\n[[Page S7282]]\n\ndemonstrate proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell designs at \nDepartment of the Navy installations. In particular, the language \nreferred to an uninterruptible substation using fuel cells based on \nproton exchange membrane technology. This was a program that the \nCongress supported last year.\n  I believe that the program the Committee intended to support this \nyear was somewhat more narrowly focused on the developing technology to \nimprove the membranes for those fuel cells that might be used in the \nsubstation program that was the subject of discussion last year or for \nother important Defense Department applications.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I agree with the Senator from Hawaii that \nimproving the membrane technology for fuel cells was the program for \nwhich the Committee recommended an addition to the Defense \nauthorization this year.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Committee for \nclarifying this situation.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The DOD authorization.\n  Mr. HATCH. Thank you, Mr. President. That is what I want to talk \nabout today, in part.\n  I rise today to respond to a few of the comments made yesterday by \nseveral of my Democratic colleagues. They have attacked the President \nand the administration for not being forthcoming in releasing documents \nnotwithstanding the fact that the White House just declassified and \nreleased approximately 260 pages of legal memoranda that they sent to \nSenator Leahy and myself.\n  Let me take a moment to review the history.\n  On June 8, 2004, the Judiciary Committee held an oversight hearing of \nthe Department of Justice. During the course of the hearing, Senator \nKennedy asked the Attorney General for any legal memoranda that had \nbeen leaked to the public. Contrary to the suggestions of some, the \nAttorney General at no time refused to answer any question posed by \nSenators on the committee. He just gave answers with which my \nDemocratic Colleagues did not agree.\n  Specifically, the Attorney General declined to agree--on the spot--to \nproduce internal executive branch legal memoranda citing the \nPresident's right to have confidential advice from his staff. The \nAttorney General believed he did not have authority to release these \ndocuments. He believed that only the President could release them.\n  Instead, that same day after the hearing, the Department of Justice \nwrote a detailed letter responding to the inquiries of the ranking \nDemocratic member of the Judiciary Committee on legal issues related to \nwartime decisions. The letter summarizes the Justice Department's legal \nopinion on whether various statutes and treaties apply on this war on \nterror, including the Uniform Code of Military Justice, the Special \nMaritime and Territorial Jurisdiction, the Military Extraterritorial \nJurisdiction Act, the torture statute, Geneva Conventions, and the War \nCrimes Act.\n  These topics are precisely the subject matter of the documents at \nissue in the hearing. The Attorney General is not trying to cover up \nanything. There can be no question that the Justice Department wanted \nto be responsive to the committee but it was not in a position to \nrelease the documents without further consultation within the \nadministration, including the White House and the Defense Department. \nThat is only fair. It is prudent during time of war when some of the \ndocuments reveal potential interrogation techniques.\n  Yet they made the Attorney General of the United States a punching \nbag, which they have done consistently day in, day out in the Judiciary \nCommittee on various markup days and hearings as well.\n  It is as though they literally hate the Attorney General of the \nUnited States. A man who I think is doing a bang-up, tremendous job. In \nfact, last week the Attorney General and the White House counsel both \nassured me that they would work with me to fairly resolve the matter. I \nrepresented that to the committee members and that wasn't enough. I was \nsarcastically challenged on that by more than one member of the \ncommittee on the Democratic side. I just calmly said: Give them a \nlittle time. They said they would work with us, and they will. And Mr. \nPresident, they did.\n  Last Tuesday, the Democratic members of the Judiciary Committee \nsubmitted a letter to the Attorney General, not just seeking the three \ndocuments mentioned at the hearing that Senator Kennedy made an issue \nof in the hearing, but seeking a total of 23 legal memoranda.\n  In addition to that, they provided a laundry list of document \nrequests so broad that it could take a year to search the files of the \nentire Federal Government to comply with such a request. We would have \nto go all the way back to the Spanish-American War to give every \ndocument that has ever been brought forth, if you followed the kind of \nreasoning that they had.\n\n  Let me give you some examples. They asked for ``any other memoranda \nor documents from Alberto Gonzales, William Haynes, William Howard \nTaft, IV, or any senior administration, and in the possession of the \nDepartment of Justice, regarding the treatment or interrogation of \nindividuals held in the custody of the U.S. Government.''\n  Any other senior administration official? That involves hundreds, if \nnot thousands, of people. Come on.\n  For each of the 23 requested memos, the Democratic Senators wanted to \nknow what has been redacted and why. They want an explanation for each \nclassification status, and they want an indication of to whom each was \ncirculated with copies of all cover letters and transmittal sheets.\n  When is it going to end? That kind of stuff is way out of bounds. It \nwas an incredibly imprudent request. It was so broad that nobody in his \nor her right mind would try to fulfill it--and certainly not a White \nHouse that is responsible.\n  In addition to the 23 requested memos, this request includes 19 other \nbroadly worded questions that require lengthy investigation and \nresponses. They want all of this by June 30. That is in just 15 days, \nas if they were entitled to all of that.\n  This document request appears to be an old-fashioned fishing \nexpedition of the lowest order. Any objective observer would have to \nconclude that this is not a legitimate exercise of our oversight \nfunction. They just want to use the typical go-to-the mattresses, \nscorched earth, litigation-like tactics to bury the Attorney General \nwith a request so broad that no one could possibly comply with it.\n  Last Wednesday, before the ink was dry on the document request letter \nsubmitted last Tuesday, the ranking minority member circulated a \nproposed resolution to formally subpoena documents from the Department \nof Justice.\n  The Democrats did not even give the Attorney General the courtesy of \na few days to respond to the original document request.\n  Yet, while the Democrats were engaging in this conspiracy, I was \nworking with the White House and the Department of Justice. I told the \nentire committee of all my efforts last week. In fact, it is because of \nmy efforts and the efforts of the President and the Department of \nDefense and the Justice Department that these documents have been \ndeclassified and disseminated so quickly.\n  Significantly, the three documents originally at issue in the \nAttorney General's hearing have been produced--that is, the actual \ndocuments that they called for in the hearing where you heard so much \nbad-mouthing of the Attorney General.\n  I got the cooperation of both the Attorney General and Alberto \nGonzales himself last week.\n  I have put up with continual complaints by our friends on the other \nside of the aisle on the Judiciary Committee as to how poorly the \ncommittee is being run. I am sick and tired of it.\n  It is about time we got rid of some of these snotty, ridiculous, \ndemeaning,\n\n[[Page S7283]]\n\nand below-the-belt type of tactics and start respecting the President \nof the United States, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Defense, \nour young men and women overseas, and quit undermining what they are \ndoing. We gave them the three documents they asked for and now there \nare all kinds of requests for more. We will never satisfy these types \nof voracious, problem-seeking people.\n  Of course, it is not good enough for some of my colleagues to just \ngive them the documents they asked for. The administration could have \nsent 1,000 memos and some of my Democratic colleagues would still not \nhave been satisfied. Talk about transparency, their strategy is \ntransparent. No matter what is sent, some will no doubt scream and \ncomplain it is not good enough, and they will get on this floor, with \ntheir holier-than-thou language, and say we must have transparency \nbecause that is the way we in the United States are.\n  If that is true, we do not need the CIA, we do not need the 15 \nintelligence agencies, and we do not need to protect our young men and \nwomen overseas anymore. We just have to have transparency. That is so \nridiculous it is hard for me to believe how the American people can \neven give any kind of consideration to that kind of talk. Yet we are \ngetting that kind of nonsense on the Senate floor almost constantly \nfrom people on the other side of the aisle.\n  This lack of good faith suggests this is more about trying to attack \nthe Attorney General and the administration than about obtaining \ndocuments necessary for legitimate exercise of oversight. It is clear \nthey want to subpoena to build a case to hold the Attorney General in \ncontempt of Congress. Why they hate this former Member of Congress, \nthis former Member of the Senate, I will never understand. There is not \na more decent, honorable, religious, kind person I know than John \nAshcroft, but he is being treated like dirt. This threatens to rapidly \ndevolve into a political witch hunt of the worst order.\n  It is sad to see this blatant political posturing. It is particularly \nsad to see this uncalled-for partisan wrangling over an issue of \nnational security in an election year. I don't think they are fooling \nanybody by their histrionics, and we sure had a lot of them over the \nlast number of days--even the last couple of weeks. Really, you can go \nback in time, ever since President George Bush was elected.\n  The amendment offered yesterday by the Senator from Nevada and the \namendment offered here is not limited to the three documents that were \nat issue in the hearing. Those documents have already been produced. It \nhas not been limited to the 23 documents listed in the first part of \ntheir document request. It is a broadly worded subpoena that would \nencompass all documents and records on this subject since January 20, \n2001, regardless of whether the documents were written by someone at \nthe Department of Justice.\n  Talk about a fishing expedition, we are talking here about deep sea \nfishing--and the worst type. Do you know how many people work at the \nDepartment of Justice? It would take forever just to ask each of the \n112,000 individuals at the Justice Department if they possessed any \nrelevant documents. That is how ridiculous the request is.\n  Moreover, the Justice Department subpoena is poorly written, as I \nhave been saying. It requests all documents and records ``describing, \nreferring, or relating to the treatment or interrogation of prisoners \nof war, enemy combatants, and individuals held in the custody or \nphysical control of the United States Government . . . in connection \nwith the investigation of terrorist activity.'' And the subpoena is not \nlimited to Justice Department records but also records possessed by the \nDepartment of Justice, written by other agencies, including the CIA or \nany military branch. This is simply too broad and they know it.\n  In addition, the subpoena requires records relating to the treatment \nof prisoners. That broad term would appear to include all the \ninterrogation or treatment records and all of the medical records of \nZacarias Moussaoui and any other individual DOJ has prosecuted or is \nprosecuting on terror-related charges subsequent to 2001. This could \ninclude any interrogation, medical records shared between the \nDepartment of Defense and the FBI relating to detainees held at \nGuantanamo Bay or in Iraq, Afghanistan, or elsewhere. This information \nrequest can involve hundreds, if not thousands, of POW and other enemy \ncombatants and hundreds of thousands of pages of records.\n\n  That is the type of base political activity that is going on in this \nbody right now. It demeans, insults, and undermines our young men and \nwomen overseas fighting for us and risking their lives every day. I, \nfor one, am sick and tired of it. I hope the American people wake up to \nthis type of foolish conduct all in the interest of Presidential \npolitics or just politics in general.\n  I don't see the practical utility of providing all of these records \npertaining to individual detainees to the Judiciary Committee. Under \nthe proposed subpoena, this information could conceivably include \nprosecution strategy memos. Can you imagine? Surveillance materials. \nCan you imagine? Information provided by and the identities of \nconfidential informants. Can you imagine that? As well as FISA, that \nis, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act materials. We normally do \nnot get these types of documents in either Democrat or Republican \nadministrations. And there is a good reason. Because this place is a \nsieve. You can't keep anything secret up here. It is easy to see why \nadministrations do not like to give confidential, secret, or top secret \nor covert information, you name it, classified information, to people \nup here.\n  Their language is simply too broad. I am also troubled by the way in \nwhich the language appears to stray far away from general policy \nquestions concerning the legal status of certain classes of detainees \nsuch as suspected al-Qaida members into matters affecting ongoing \nintelligence gathering and the prosecution of individual terrorist \nsubjects.\n  Give me a break. Let's give our country a break. Let's give our \nPresident a break. Let's give our Attorney General a break. Above all, \nlet's give our young men and women overseas a break from these types of \npartisan, political activities.\n  Let me say when the shoe was on the other foot, the Democrats have \nadvocated just as I have. Four years ago, when President Clinton was in \noffice, my colleague from Vermont, advocated the following practice:\n\n       Our standard practice should be to issue subpoenas only \n     when attempts to obtain documents by other means have failed. \n     At a minimum, we should at least request documents in writing \n     before attempting to compel their production. . . . As part \n     of this duty, the Committee should take every reasonable \n     effort to see whether subpoenas are actually necessary before \n     publicly requesting them.\n\n  That is the distinguished ranking member of the Judiciary Committee \nfrom Vermont speaking. Let's go through that one more time. When the \nshoe was on the other foot, and our side was asking for some documents, \nthe quote was:\n\n       Our standard practice should be to issue subpoenas only \n     when attempts to obtain documents by other means have failed.\n\n  That is a quote.\n  The fact is, they didn't even give the Attorney General time to even \nthink about it before they were slapping a subpoena down in last week's \nmarkup, just a few days after. And then, four years ago my colleague \nfrom Vermont continued:\n\n       At a minimum, we should at least request documents in \n     writing before attempting to compel their production.\n\n  I guess 2 days in writing is more than an ample request in their eyes \nnow that they are in the minority and now that John Ashcroft is \nAttorney General.\n\n       As part of his duty, the committee should take every \n     reasonable effort to see whether subpoenas are actually \n     necessary before publicly requesting them.\n\n  No, they pursued a subpoena. We had to vote on it. It was a party-\nline vote. I guess they thought they could get at least one Republican \nto allow their nefarious scheme to go forward. They did not try to use \nevery reasonable effort to see whether subpoenas were actually \nnecessary. And I am sure the reason, they will say, is because John \nAshcroft has not appeared before the committee in a long time.\n  My gosh, the man almost died this year. And I don't blame anybody for\n\n[[Page S7284]]\n\nnot wanting to come up in front of this bunch when all you do is get \ndemeaned, with implications that you are a liar, that you are not \ncooperative, that you are not doing a good job, and many other \nimplications, as well, that are derogatory in nature.\n  When are we going to start treating administration people with \nrespect and dignity? Here the Democrats are not making any reasonable \neffort to attempt to obtain any of the documents by other means. They \ndid not even give the Justice Department a day to respond to their \nwritten questions before drafting a subpoena. What kind of bullying \ntactic is that? We know what the Democrats are up to because the \nSenator from Vermont told us what the purpose of a subpoena was just 4 \nyears ago.\n  He said:\n\n       [I]ssuing subpoenas may make for a good show of partisan \n     force by the majority but certainly continues the erosion of \n     civil discourse that has marked this Congress. Why is that \n     true then but not now? Let me suggest that my Democratic \n     colleagues are trying to take this one step further, as well. \n     The minority is attempting to make a show of partisan force \n     by distorting the facts for the American public.\n\n  Especially where the administration has indicated its willingness to \nbe cooperative, issuing a subpoena would not merely continue the \nerosion of civil discourse; it would accelerate it by exponential \nproportions.\n  To suggest that the Senate issue a subpoena before the deadline to \ncomply with a document request has even passed irreparably debilitates \nthe credibility of my colleagues and shows they are merely \ngrandstanding and not pursuing a legitimate oversight function, in \nspite of the holier-than-thou approach that some of them use.\n  Now, we have seen holier-than-thou approaches on both sides, I \nsuppose, but I have never seen it worse than it is right now.\n  Yesterday, the President released not only the three documents at \nissue in the DOJ oversight hearing but 260 pages of documents, at my \nrequest--something I said I thought I could get them to do, after \nhaving talked with the Attorney General of the United States and Judge \nGonzales. That was not good enough at the time. They were moaning and \npicking and groaning at me, saying they would never do it. But they \ndid.\n  Thus far, the administration has released 13 lengthy memoranda \nrelating to the treatment or interrogation of detainees, including \nrelevant documents that were not specifically requested by the \ncommittee.\n  Come on. This administration has bent over backwards, and they will \nnever satisfy these naysayers on the other side who want to make \npolitical points and who want to damage the Attorney General of the \nUnited States, the Secretary of Defense, and, above all, the President \nof the United States. I have to say, they are really good at playing \nthis political game. They have a lot of help in our media in this \ncountry that seems to just go right along with it.\n  This may not be the end of the document production by the Departments \nof Justice and Defense, et cetera. The Department of Justice has until \nJune 30, 2004, to respond to the Democrats' document request. It may \nwell be that after June 30, 2004, there may be additional documents \nthat we will need to see. But to seek such a broadly worded subpoena \nprematurely makes absolutely no sense. It flies in the face of \nreasonableness.\n  But let me say that it appears from what we know now--and I will \nexpect the administration to correct me if I am wrong on this point--we \nhave already gotten the most important documents. But I guess they just \nhave not given the Democrats enough fodder with which they can attack \nthe Attorney General and the President and others in this \nadministration. After all, most of them were legal documents, legal \nopinions, where you can differ, and in most cases where they say, well, \nthis is what the law is, but there is another side to it that could be \nargued, and the courts might find something to it. That is what you \nexpect in a legal opinion. But they not only ask for the legal \nopinions; they ask for the preparatory documents that were leading up \nto the legal opinions.\n  I heard my colleague from Vermont mention, repeatedly: Like water, \ngovernment policy flows downhill. I must say that I agree with him. \nClearly, the most important document of those released by the White \nHouse is the one that the President of the United States signed on \nFebruary 7, 2002. You do not get any higher than the President in this \ncountry, from a political standpoint.\n\n  In that memo, the President acknowledged that even though he was \nadvised that he was not legally obligated to provide the protections of \nthe Geneva Conventions to the Taliban or to the detainees at Guantanamo \nBay, Cuba, that he intended to do so anyway.\n  But that is not enough for them. Here is the now unclassified White \nHouse memorandum for the Vice President, the Secretary of State, the \nSecretary of Defense, the Attorney General, the chief of staff to the \nPresident, the Director of Central Intelligence, the assistant to the \nPresident for National Security Affairs, the Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff.\n  These are documents that are usually never given up by Presidents, by \nthe way.\n  The subject: ``Humane Treatment of al Qaeda and Taliban Detainees.'' \nThe part shown at the bottom on this page of the letter is in yellow. \nLet me read the paragraph just above that. Let me read No. 2:\n\n       Pursuant to my authority as Commander in Chief and Chief \n     Executive of the United States, and relying on the opinion of \n     the Department of Justice dated January 22, 2002, and on the \n     legal opinion rendered by the Attorney General in his letter \n     of February 1, 2002, I hereby determine as follows:\n\n  Now, this is a finding, by the way:\n\n       a. I accept the legal conclusion of the Department of \n     Justice and determine that none of the provisions of Geneva \n     apply to our conflict with al Qaeda in Afghanistan or \n     elsewhere throughout the world because, among other reasons, \n     al Qaeda is not a High Contracting Party to Geneva.\n\n  I think that sounds pretty logical to a logical person. But look at \nthis:\n\n       b. I accept the legal conclusion of the Attorney General \n     and the Department of Justice that I have the authority under \n     the Constitution to suspend Geneva as between the United \n     States and Afghanistan, but I decline to exercise that \n     authority at this time. Accordingly, I determine that the \n     provisions of Geneva will apply to our present conflict with \n     the Taliban. I reserve the right to exercise this authority \n     in this or future conflicts.\n\n  There is good reason why he reserved the right to exercise this \nauthority--a very good reason--and that is, we are not fighting a \nconventional war; we are fighting a war in the most unconventional way, \nagainst people who do not wear uniforms, who do not represent a \nparticular country, who are helter-skelter all over the world, who are \nvicious, brutal killers and murderers and terrorists, who have more \nthan shown us how vicious they are. They do not deserve, in the eyes of \nmany legal minds, the type of protections that Geneva would provide. \nBut he is going to provide it to them anyway.\n  But that is not good enough over here. They have to find something, \nin some documents, in these hundreds of pages of documents, that can \nhelp to bring down this President.\n  Well, look, go to No. 3:\n\n       Of course, our values as a nation, values that we share \n     with many nations in the world, call for us to treat \n     detainees humanely, including those who are not legally \n     entitled to such treatment.\n\n  Our Nation has been, and will continue to be, a strong supporter of \nGeneva and its principles. As a matter of policy, the U.S. Armed Forces \nshall continue to treat detainees humanely and, to the extent \nappropriate and consistent with military necessity, in a manner \nconsistent with the principles of Geneva.\n  I do not know how you say it much more clearly than that. But you \nhave read all the newspapers condemning the President. Yet the \nPresident is following Geneva. But he did. To hear the other side, you \nwould think that he did not.\n  Look at No. 5:\n\n       I hereby reaffirm the order previously issued by the \n     Secretary of Defense--\n\n  ``[P]reviously issued by the Secretary of Defense''--\n\n     to the United States Armed Forces requiring that the \n     detainees be treated humanely and, to the extent appropriate \n     and consistent with military necessity, in a manner \n     consistent with the principles of Geneva.\n\n  I do not know what my colleagues need further, but that is what the \nPresident signed. My gosh, there is the\n\n[[Page S7285]]\n\nPresident's signature right at the bottom of this letter.\n\n       I hereby direct the Secretary of State to communicate my \n     determinations in an appropriate manner to our allies, and \n     other countries and international organizations cooperating \n     in the war against terrorism of global reach.\n\n  My gosh, what is this all about? I will tell you what it is all \nabout. It is about politics, pure and simple. They cannot win fairly, \nso they do it by distorting what is going on.\n  If they could win by distorting, that would be great, hunky-dory for \nthem, I suppose. Well, it is not for me.\n  Paragraph 2b:\n\n       I accept the legal conclusion of the Attorney General . . .\n\n  This is the fellow they are maligning all the time. This awful \nAttorney General, John Ashcroft. But he says:\n\n       I accept the legal conclusion of the Attorney General and \n     the Department of Justice that I have the authority under the \n     Constitution to suspend Geneva as between the United States \n     and Afghanistan, but I decline to exercise that authority at \n     this time.\n\n  He determines that the provisions of the Geneva will apply.\n\n       Of course, our values as a Nation, values that we share \n     with the other nations in the world, call for us to treat \n     detainees humanely . . .\n\n  The fact is some of our knuckleheads--darn few of them--have treated \ndetainees inhumanely. You would think the President himself went over \nthere and did those awful things, or that Donald Rumsfeld, who has done \na fantastic job in helping to change the whole military structure in \nmany ways in this country for the better, had gone over there and done \nthis, or General Abizaid.\n  That letter blows away these types of phony arguments.\n  After hundreds of pages of analysis, after months of research and \nwriting, the most severe punishment the Secretary of Defense authorized \nis the ``use of mild, noninjurious physical contact such as grabbing, \npoking in the chest with the finger and light pushing.''\n  I could tell you, having studied it, there is a whole panoply of \nacceptable Geneva interrogation techniques. I can tell you not all of \nthem were used. The top level of very stressful ones were not \nauthorized to be used.\n  Everything I have seen says that. Why this body would want to issue a \nsubpoena that, one, failed in committee--they couldn't get it through \ncommittee because everybody there recognized it was a political \nexercise, brought very prematurely, without giving the administration a \nchance to comply, in disregard of the committee chairman's, my, offer \nto bring about a release of documents, and with a release of documents \nthat is, by any measure, impressive--and two, is not ripe since the \ndeadline to respond to the document request has not even come and gone. \nWhy they would do that is beyond me.\n  I said earlier today I am one of the few people who has gone to and \ngone completely through Guantanamo. I can only speak for the time I was \nat Guantanamo and that was a few weeks ago. But I went and witnessed \ntheir interrogation techniques. I saw two interrogations that were not \nstaged for me--one with a very uncooperative al-Qaida member they would \noccasionally get something from and another with another one who has \nbeen very cooperative because of the techniques that have been used, \nthat have been fair and reasonable, within the Geneva Conventions rules \nand techniques. I saw how they handled the prisoners. I saw the \nincentive systems to get the detainees to try to cooperate.\n  I saw the assault record of some of these vicious detainees who I \nthink some on the other side would like to coddle right to bed every \nnight. Dozens of assaults made against our soldiers, including, since \nthese are open wire cells, on a number of occasions throwing urine and \nfeces all over the soldiers who have to walk up and down the halls.\n  I don't know about you, but if somebody did that to me, I wouldn't be \nvery happy. If I recall correctly, there have only been three times \nwhere they have had to discipline soldiers because the rest of them \nstood and took it, even though that is one of the most offensive things \nthat could be done to somebody, three times. One was acquitted, the \nother two suffered severe punishment.\n\n  In other words, we have punished our soldiers for getting mad because \nsomebody threw feces and urine on them. I would be mad. I am for our \nsoldiers. I wish--I am not going to second-guess the military courts, \nbut I wish they had not been punished other than maybe reprimanded. \nThere are some down there who are so vicious they would kill our \nsoldiers if they had a chance. And they have done things like this \nrepeatedly. Dozens and dozens of assaults on our young men and women \ndown there.\n  What bothers me, almost more than anything else, is I have described \none of the Presidential findings, and there are others that are being \nread on the sides of mountains by Zarqawi and by Osama bin Laden, top \nsecret documents that have been given up because of these types of \nshenanigans. These types of things put our young men and women at risk. \nThese political games are putting young men and women at risk. To \ndisclose anything about interrogations puts our young men and women at \nrisk. That does not mean we should not prosecute those who have \nviolated the President's order of humane treatment. But interestingly \nenough, in the Abu Ghraib prison situation, the minute it became known \nthese types of activities were going on, investigations started and \nprosecutions have resulted. But that is not good enough because there \nis a demand that they have to go right up to the top which means even \nthe President, as if he were over there in Abu Ghraib himself, or \nRumsfeld was over in Abu Ghraib or General Abizaid, they should be \npunished, or there should at least be some responsibility on their part \nfor this aberration of conduct by so few in the Abu Ghraib prison.\n  Let me tell you, I am getting sick of it. I am getting sick of this \npartisan activity. I don't have much of a voice right now because I am \nso doggone sick of it. Frankly, it is beneath the dignity of the \nSenate. I think there might come a time for subpoenas, if there had \nbeen no cooperation, if there had been plenty of honorable time given \nto the administration to comply, if there had been no compliance, if \nthere hadn't been any effort by the chairman to try and obtain these \ndocuments, if there had been no response by the White House counsel or \nthe White House itself, or if there had been no desire on the part of \nthe Attorney General to cooperate. They now have all the documents they \nasked for at that hearing. And now we get a request, a broad request \nfor so many more that would tie up all of these important people to \nsuch a degree that I think it damages our young men and women not only \nin Iraq but Afghanistan as well.\n  Why? Why is it? Why do we hear these holier than thou rantings? \nBecause we have to make sure this administration does its job because \nwe don't trust them, I guess. At least that seems to be the tenor of \nthe argument, and that this administration must be doing something \nwrong because it had legal memoranda and legal opinions that indicated \nmaybe the Geneva Conventions don't apply in this unconventional war, \nwith unconventional, murderous, and vicious terrorists.\n  Well, let me say, I am disappointed they ignore these types of \ndocuments. I am disappointed we get all these documents and they are \nnot satisfactory. I am disappointed there is a call for transparency of \nall these things. I guess Osama bin Laden can read these things as \nwell, or even Zarqawi, and know everything we are thinking, everything \nwe do. He ought to be able to cut off a lot of heads with the knowledge \nwe are giving him.\n\n  The fact is, almost any time anything is released here, it shows up \nin the liberal media. It shows up to the disadvantage of our country, \nto the disadvantage of our young men and women over there. I don't \nthink anybody on this side is saying we should not be transparent in \nthe ways we should be transparent, but to use that transparent argument \nand push it to its ultimate extreme means we should not have 15 \nintelligence agencies where we have classified information to protect \nour country. If you push it to the extreme, that is what you are \nsaying. I believe it has been pushed to exactly that extreme.\n  I believe the demands have been extreme. They are unconscionable in \nsome ways--not all of them. That is\n\n[[Page S7286]]\n\nwhy the documents are being given to them. It was important to meet the \nreasonable requests for those three documents. They have been given. I \ndon't see anything wrong with that.\n  I also believe we ought to respect the need to keep some matters from \ntransparency in the best interests of our young men and women. I have \nto say I know that not all of our servants act appropriately. Everybody \nmakes mistakes. Certainly, the things that happened in Abu Ghraib and \nin Afghanistan should never have happened. They need to be \ninvestigated, and, where appropriate, prosecutions have to take place. \nNobody should be spared who participated in those wrongful, illegal \nactivities that fly in the face of what the President approved and what \nthe Secretary of Defense approved. I stand with my colleagues on the \nother side with regard to that. There is no doubt in my mind about \nthat.\n  But when it comes to just playing crass politics and demanding more \nand more so it can be released to the public so ``transparency'' can be \nhad over documents that should not be released to the public, then I \nhave to call it what it is. It is crass political activity that flies \nin the face of what is right. I think directly and indirectly it hurts \nour young men and women overseas.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, my \nfriend, has spoken for about 55 minutes, which leaves little time for \nthe ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, the person going to \noffer the amendment. I will not offer a unanimous consent agreement \nuntil such time as the manager of the bill or someone from the majority \nis able to respond, but I am going to ask unanimous consent that the \nSenator from Vermont be allowed to speak until the hour of 9:45.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order be \nextended to allow the Senator from Vermont to speak for 15 minutes, and \nthat following his speech, we vote on the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we want to accommodate the Senator. \nWhatever happened, happened. We are glad to, in an equitable way, offer \nhim this time. I will try to take the floor in the area of 9:40, if \nthat is convenient.\n  Mr. LEAHY. How about 9:45?\n  Mr. WARNER. OK. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I appreciate the continuing courtesy of my \ndear friend, the senior Senator from Virginia. I said earlier on the \nfloor of the Senate that he and I have been friends for over a quarter \nof a century. I have aged in that time, but he has not. I do appreciate \nhis continuing courtesies.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague. We have served together these 26 \nyears now in this body.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have listened to some of the debate in \nthe last 30 or 40 minutes, and it is sort of like a tempest in a \nteapot--a great deal of shouting and carrying on, but not really \nhitting the central point.\n  I spent years as a prosecutor. It was one of the best jobs I ever \nhad. I had the great opportunity to try a lot of cases. I was in the \ncourtroom several days every week in Burlington, VT. We had a saying \nthere, as we do in many States, that if you have the facts on your \nside, you pound the facts. If you have the law on your side, you pound \nthe law. Of course, if you have neither on your side, you pound the \ntable. We have heard a lot of table pounding tonight.\n  The fact is that every American, Republican or Democrat, knows that \nsome terrible things happened at Abu Ghraib prison. Some apparently \nhappened in Afghanistan and some in Guantanamo. These are acts that are \nbeneath a great and wonderful country such as the United States, a \ncountry blessed with a Constitution and laws and values that serve as a \nshining beacon for much of the rest of the world.\n  This did not happen here, and it is not answered by going out and \ncashiering a couple of corporals or a couple of privates and saying: \nThere, look what we have done.\n  We all know that the 140,000 American men and women serving in Iraq \nand in Afghanistan and Guantanamo are obeying the laws, and upholding \nthe best ideals of the United States. And many of our soldiers have \nbeen told they are going to serve much longer than their Government \noriginally told them they would have to.\n  There are some, however, who did the same wrong things in Iraq as \nthey did in Afghanistan and as they did in Guantanamo. Who gave them \nthe green light? Don't tell me it is just a handful of bad actors. If \nso, those few bad actors must have a wonderful frequent flyer program \nto be able to show up in Abu Ghraib one day, Afghanistan the next, and \nGuantanamo the next. Somewhere there was some core permission given. It \nwent to those who were willing to follow a wrong order.\n  My colleagues can table my amendment, but it will aid the coverup of \nwhat has become an international prisoner abuse scandal. If this \namendment is tabled, as it may be, it says that the Republican Senators \nhave decided to join the Republican administration in circling the \nwagons of the unfolding prisoner abuse scandal.\n  The American public--Republicans, Democrats, and Independents--are \nsick and tired of being lied to. They are sick of the secrecy. They are \ndemanding answers all over this Nation, but the wagons continue to \ncircle.\n  My amendment would require the administration to cooperate with a \nthorough congressional investigation into the abuse of prisoners in \nU.S. custody by releasing all documents relevant to the scandal. We \ncall for the release of all relevant documents, not a tiny subset of \ndocuments selected by the administration when the political heat was \non.\n  The question for us as Senators is, Are we content to see the Senate \nserve as an arm of the executive branch, or are there some of us--at \nleast a majority of us--who actually read the Constitution and realize \nwe are an independent branch of Government? The distinguished senior \nSenator from West Virginia has reminded us that we do not serve under \nPresidents, we serve with Presidents. He has reminded us that there are \nthree branches of Government, each independent of the other. \nNonetheless, we hear arguments on the floor that we can't ask for these \ndocuments because the executive branch does not want to show them to \nus. But, we are independent Senators, all 100 of us.\n  Somewhere in the upper reaches of this administration, a process was \nset in motion that seeped forward until it produced this awful scandal. \nSo to put the scandal behind us--which all of us want to do--we have to \nunderstand what happened.\n  The President of the United States has said they want to get to the \nbottom of this. So do I, but you cannot get to the bottom of this until \nyou have a clear picture of what is on the top. We have heard the party \nline on this scandal. The Senator from Alabama argued that the whole \nthing boils down to just a few people on the midnight shift in Abu \nGhraib prison who got out of control. He said that a few people came in \nat midnight and somehow they got out of control. That line has become \nharder and harder to swallow as every day new evidence surfaces that \nthe abuses were widespread.\n\n  The photographs may be limited to a small group of soldiers at Abu \nGhraib, but the abuses were not. It is not right for any of us to claim \nthis was just a small thing when every one of us has seen how extensive \nthe photographs are, those that have been revealed to the public and \nthose that have not.\n  I question the idea that it was only in Abu Ghraib. As I said, \nsomebody must be getting frequent flyer miles because the same thing \nwas happening at Abu Ghraib prison, Afghanistan, and Guantanamo. Just \nlast week, a Federal grand jury indicted a CIA contractor for brutally \nbeating a prisoner in Afghanistan in June of last year. Why did they \nindict him? Because the prisoner died the day after he was beaten.\n\n[[Page S7287]]\n\n  The Army has opened a criminal investigation into injuries suffered \nby a U.S. soldier who was posing as an uncooperative detainee during \ntraining with military police at Guantanamo Bay. That soldier suffered \ntraumatic brain injury. This was a brave American soldier who went into \na training program. Suddenly, apparently, the rules changed, He used a \ncode word to stop it. He said: I am an American soldier. They kept on \ndoing what somebody higher up had given them the order to do, and he \nsuffered traumatic brain injury.\n  I could go on and on about this. My point is, it is not just a few \nbad apples in Abu Ghraib. These things have happened in Afghanistan, \nIraq, and Guantanamo. Does anybody seriously think that the American \npublic is going to fall for a lie that it is a coincidence that a bunch \nof MPs in Iraq were abusing prisoners with the very same tactics that \nwere being debated at the highest levels of Government, such as the use \nof hoods, the use of dogs, the removal of clothing? Do we think these \npeople are somehow telepathic, that they can read the minds of those at \nthe White House or the Pentagon?\n  Yesterday, the White House released a tiny subset of the materials we \nsought. This was not all the material we requested. It was a tiny \nsubset. All of those documents should have been provided earlier to \nCongress. Much more remains held back from public view.\n  The documents that were released raised more questions than they \nanswered.\n  After January 2002, did the President sign any other orders or \ndirectives? Did he sign any with regard to prisoners in Iraq? Why did \nSecretary Rumsfeld issue and later rescind interrogation techniques?\n  How did these interrogation techniques come to be used in Iraq even \nthough the administration has maintained it followed the Geneva \nConventions there?\n  Why is the White House withholding relevant documents produced after \nApril 2003?\n  Where is the remaining 95 percent of the materials requested by \nmembers of the Senate Judiciary Committee?\n  We have heard on the floor there was a broad-brush request made for \nthe documents. But it was actually a request for 23 specific documents. \nThe White House gave 3 of the 23 and said that it had complied. \nIncidentally, of those three, two had already appeared on the Internet. \nThe press had found them out before the White House gave them to us.\n  So even though they gave only one that had not been made public \nbefore, I will give them credit for all three. Where are the other 20?\n  When are we, as Senators, going to stop sitting on our hands, \nbecoming a rubberstamp for an administration cloaked in secrecy?\n  We have the legal right, we have the constitutional obligation, and I \nremind Senators we have the moral authority to ask questions and demand \nanswers today.\n  We have been blessed in this country with a great and wonderful \ncountry, but that is a blessing that comes with some responsibilities. \nWe are not maintaining that responsibility unless we keep the pressure \non, until we get honesty and we get answers.\n  So I urge my colleagues, vote down the motion to table. Let us show \nthe Senate is willing to stand up. Let us do what Senators have done in \nthe past. We did it during the Watergate era. We have done it at other \ntimes. Let us stand up and ask the questions the American public wants \nus to ask.\n  The press seems to be doing it for us. After extensive investigation, \nthe Guardian uncovered widespread evidence of violent abuse and sexual \nhumiliation of prisoners at Baghram and other U.S. detention centers \naround Afghanistan. We should have found that out, and we should have \nstopped it. As I said before, a Federal grand jury indicted a CIA \ncontractor for brutally assaulting a detainee in Afghanistan June 2003. \nWe should have found that out. Instead, we turned a blind eye.\n  Defense Secretary Rumsfeld admitted in November 2003 that he ordered \na prisoner be held incommunicado, off the prison rolls, and out of the \nsight of the Red Cross. This ghost detainee got lost in the system for \n7 months. Despite his high intelligence value, this ghost detainee \nreceived only a cursory initial interview while in detention.\n  Major General Taguba later criticized the practice of keeping ghost \ndetainees as deceptive, contrary to Army doctrine, and in violation of \ninternational law.\n  The New York Times reported that military lawyers and some colonels \nreceived memos citing complaints of abuse at Abu Ghraib in November \n2003, 2 months before photographic evidence of abuse prompted the \nmilitary to launch an investigation. At the same time, the letters I \nhad written to the Department of Defense and others about what we had \nheard were not answered.\n  In fact, it turns out now that the majority of detainees at \nGuantanamo Bay are not the worst of the worst, as the administration \nasserted, but rather low-level recruits or even innocent men swept up \nin the chaos of war. This is why, after years, not a single one has \nbeen brought before a military tribunal. This is not the mark of a \ngreat country. This is not the mark of a moral country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise this evening in support of \nSenator Leahy's second-degree amendment which seeks to compel, by law, \nthe Executive Branch to provide certain important documents to \nCongress.\n  I wish to focus on one particular issue that has been raised by those \nwho oppose this effort--that provision of these documents will endanger \nour national security by informing our enemies of the details of our \ninterrogation tactics.\n  I believe this objection is misplaced and the danger of compromising \nnational security can be easily and simply eliminated.\n  I am a member of the Select Committee on Intelligence, and as my \ncolleagues know, that committee regularly receives information of the \nhighest classification involving our Intelligence community. Similarly, \nthe Armed Services Committee receives information about the most \nsensitive of our military secrets. The Judiciary Committee receives \ninformation about extremely sensitive law enforcement matters. In \nshort, the Congress and its committees are regularly provided the most \nsensitive of our Nation's secrets.\n  In the present case I accept that some of the documents we have \nsought from the Department of Justice and Department of Defense about \nthe law, policy and procedures governing interrogations may be properly \nclassified. In other words, I quote from the governing executive order, \nExecutive Order 12958, which describes ``top secret'' as being \ninformation ``the unauthorized disclosure of which reasonably could be \nexpected to cause exceptionally grave damage to the national \nsecurity.''\n  But the question of classification is unrelated to the question of \nwhether the Congress should have access to information which is needed. \nWe have procedures, administered by the Office of Senate Security, \nwhich ensures that such information is handled properly, safely, and \nsecurely. simply put, providing information to the Congress is not the \nsame as making it public, or providing it to terrorists.\n  As some of my colleagues know, I asked the Attorney General directly \nwhether any of the material which he was refusing to provide to the \nCongress was classified. He did not answer my question, but if the \nanswer is yes, then the Congress has the ability to receive such \ninformation.\n  It is important to focus on the issue at hand, which is what \ninformation should, and must, be provided to Congress so it can perform \nits constitutional role to legislate and conduct oversight. The issue \nis not what information to provide to the terrorists.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Leahy \nsecond-degree amendment. I am proud to cosponsor the Leahy second-\ndegree amendment. The Leahy amendment would require the administration \nto provide the Senate with all documents in the Justice Department's \npossession relating to the treatment and interrogation of detainees.\n  Since the world learned about the horrible abuses at Abu Ghraib \nprison, there has been mounting evidence that high-ranking members of \nthis administration authorized the use of interrogation tactics that \nviolate our longstanding treaty obligations. There is increasing \npressure on the administration to come clean and provide the Congress \nwith all documents related to the use of torture.\n  Yesterday, in a transparent effort to stop the pressure for full \ndisclosure, the administration provided Congress with a 2-inch stack of \ndocuments. But a cursory review of these documents reveals that the \nadministration is withholding a lot of crucial information. If \nanything, the documents that were released yesterday make it even more \nclear that we need complete disclosure from the administration. As the \nChicago Tribune reported today:\n\n       The memos left unanswered at least as many questions as \n     they answered. White House officials acknowledged that the \n     documents provided only a partial record of the \n     administration's actions concerning treatment of prisoners.\n\n  What do the documents that were released show? In a January 2002 \nmemo, the President concluded that ``new thinking in the law of war'' \nwas needed. Under our Constitution, it is Congress's job to make the \nlaws. If the President wants to change the law of war, which has served \nour country well since the time of President Abraham Lincoln, he must \ncome to the Congress and ask us, the people's representatives, to \nchange the law. He cannot change the law by executive fiat. The memo \nfrom the President was stamped for declassification in 2012, so clearly \nthis administration had no intention to consult with Congress or the \nAmerican people about their plans to change the law of war.\n  In response to the President's mandate, in August 2002, the Justice \nDepartment sent a memo to the White House on the use of torture. It \nmakes unprecedented claims about the President's power that violate \nbasic constitutional principles. The Justice Department concludes that \nthe torture statute, which makes torture a crime,\n\n[[Page S7289]]\n\ndoes not apply to interrogations conducted under the President's \nCommander in Chief authority. They also adopt a new, very restrictive \ndefinition of torture. They state that torture involves:\n\n     . . . intense pain or suffering of the kind that is \n     equivalent to the pain that would be associated with serious \n     physical injury so severe that death, organ failure, or \n     permanent damage resulting in a loss of significant body \n     function will likely result.\n\n  This contradicts what Attorney General John Ashcroft told the \nJudiciary Committee just 2 weeks ago. He said that it is Congress's job \nto define torture and that the administration had not adopted a new \ndefinition of torture.\n  The Defense Department, relying on the Justice Department's work, \nalso responded to the President's call for new thinking about the law \nof war. In a November 2002 memo, Defense Secretary Rumsfeld approved \nthe use of coercive interrogation techniques at Gauantanamo Bay. These \nincluded ``removal of clothing,'' using dogs to intimidate detainees, \nsensory deprivation, and placing detainees in stress positions, \nincluding forced standing for up to 4 hours. Rumsfeld's only comment on \nthese procedures was a personal note at the bottom of the approval \nmemo, ``I stand for 8-10 hours a day. Why is standing limited to four \nhours?''\n  Let me answer that question.\n  In the 1930s, Stalin's secret police forced dissidents to stand for \nprolonged periods to coerce confessions for show trials. In 1956, \nexperts commissioned by the CIA documented the effects of forced \nstanding. They found that ankles and feet swell to twice their normal \nsize, the heart rate increases, some people faint, and the kidneys \neventually shut down.\n  After military officers raised moral and legal concerns about the \ntactics Rumsfeld has approved, he rescinded his approval while the \nPentagon conducted an internal review.\n  In an April 2003 memo, Rumsfeld issued revised rules. These allowed \nfor interrogation tactics with truly Orwellian names. These included:\n  ``Sleep adjustment,'' which the DOD claims is not the same as sleep \ndeprivation;\n  ``Dietary manipulation,'' which DOD claims is not the same as food \ndeprivation; and\n  ``Environmental manipulation,'' which DOD acknowledges ``some \nnations'' may view as ``inhumane.''\n  White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales said these memos show that the \nadministration engaged in a ``thorough and deliberative process'' on \ninterrogation practices.\n  There is just one problem: Congress was not involved in the process. \nArticle 1 of the Constitution says that it is Congress that makes the \nlaws, not the President. The President cannot change the law of war or \nthe definition of torture. Only Congress can.\n  The memos that were released yesterday leave many questions \nunanswered. They include directives related to Defense Department \ninterrogations of detainees at Guantanamo Bay. But they do not tell us \nwhat interrogation techniques were approved for use by the CIA or other \ngovernment agencies. They do not tell us what interrogation techniques \nwere approved for use in Iraq. Yesterday, White House Counsel Gonzales \nsaid, ``We categorically reject any connection'' between the \nAdministration's torture memos and abuses at Abu Ghraib.\n  But how can the administration reject these connections when the \ntechniques that Rumsfeld approved for use in Guantanamo were also used \nin Abu Ghraib prison? And what about the Justice Department torture \nmemo? According to press reports today, the administration is now \ndisavowing the memo.\n  But what does that mean? The memo was apparently vetted by the \nJustice Department, sent to the White House, and was the basis for the \nDefense Department's memos on torture.\n  Who requested the Justice Department memo and what was done in \nresponse to the memo? Were the legal arguments contained in the memo \nused to justify the use of torture?\n  Yesterday, the President said, ``We do not condone torture. I have \nnever ordered torture. I will never order torture.''\n  What definition of torture is the President using? Is it the one that \nthe Justice Department created? What about other forms of cruel \ntreatment that are prohibited by the Constitution, treaties and laws of \nthe United States?\n  This is a very serious issue for our Nation.

The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I believe the veterans health care \namendment is next; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 2 minutes of debate evenly divided.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, one of the surprising aspects of the \ndebate about the amendment now pending has been the testimonials from \nsome colleagues who say they like the current VA funding system.\n  If you believe you can look veterans in the eye and tell them they \nare well\n\n[[Page S7290]]\n\nserved by the current VA health care system, then my amendment is not \nfor you.\n  If you are satisfied with telling 500,000 veterans they cannot enroll \nat the VA, then this amendment is not for you.\n  If you think the system is performing well that results in hundreds \nof thousands of veterans waiting months, sometimes years, to see a \ndoctor to get prescription drugs, then vote no on this amendment.\n  If you feel good about voting to ask veterans to contribute more than \na billion dollars out of pocket for their health care costs and send \nout the bill collectors to hunt them down and make sure it works, this \namendment is not for you.\n  Lastly, if you think it is appropriate to ask hundreds of thousands \nof men and women to sacrifice everything for their country and not \nensure that they can get access to health care when they return, my \namendment is not for you.\n  Those considering opposing my amendment should take a look around. \nPresident Bush's own veterans health care task force, as well as the \nchairman and ranking member of the House Committee on Veterans Affairs, \nbelieve the current system is broken and that it urgently needs fixing \nand have endorsed the concept underlying this amendment. Every single \nveterans group in the country has done so as well.\n  If you believe we have an obligation to our troops, I urge you to \nback it up with action by voting for this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote against this \namendment. This amendment creates a new entitlement program, set up by \na formula designed to add benefits based on eligible people. My father-\nin-law is eligible, but he doesn't receive VA benefits. Now we are \ngoing to set that up as an entitlement that would cost $300 billion--\nthree-fourths of the cost of the Medicare bill expansion last year? We \nhave a lot of people saying we believe in paying for these. This was \nnot paid for. This would increase the deficit by $300 billion.\n  We are doing a lot for veterans right now. If you look at it, we \ndidn't do a lot during the Clinton administration, but we have done a \nlot under the Bush administration--up 50 percent in the last few years. \nWe are going from 2004, $61 billion, to $70 billion in 2005, a 15-\npercent increase. Yet some people say that is still not enough.\n  I think this amendment is not so much about helping veterans. I think \nit is trying to help politicians. I urge my colleagues to sustain the \nbudget point of order.\n  The pending amendment offered by the Senator from South Dakota, Mr. \nDaschle, increases mandatory spending and, if adopted, would cause the \nunderlying bill to exceed the committee's allocation section 302(a) \nallocation. Therefore, I raise a point of order against the amendment \npursuant to 302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I move to waive the relevant sections of \nthe Budget Act for my amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to vitiate the \naction on the Ensign second-degree amendment No. 3467 and withdraw it. \nThat is a technical requirement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3121\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I have submitted an amendment that \nmakes sure that military families don't lose eligibility for Head \nStart, the School Breakfast and Lunch Programs, Child Care and \nDevelopment Block Grants, and the Low Income Energy Assistance Program \nwhen a parent is sent off to war.\n  Currntly, military families living on the margin, who qualify for \nFederal benefits, are at risk of losing those benefits if the service \nmember in the family qualifies for special pay. If, for example, an \nactive duty parent is deployed to a combat zone, and begins to receive \nadditional combat pay, the temporary increase in income may result in \nhis or her family losing eligibility for vital social services. My \namendment would preclude additional military pay, specifically combat \npay and the family separation allowance, from being counted as income \nfor purpose of determining eligibility for certain federal benefits.\n  The Federal programs that are affected are those that are available \nto all Americans and where Federal law determines eligibility and \ngenerally provide food, child care, educational, and energy assistance \nto needy families. More specifically, the programs that would be \naffected are: The School Breakfast and Lunch Programs, Child Care and \nDevelopment Block Grants, Head Start, and the Low Income Energy \nAssistance Program.\n  The Subcommittee on Children and Families, which I chair, in \ncooperation with the Armed Services Subcommittee on Personnel, chaired \nby the Senator from Georgia, Mr. Chambliss, has put a special focus on \nhelping military parents raising children. Together we have held six \nhearings since June of last year--five in the field, and one here in \nWashington. A number of issues have come to the attention of Senators \nthrough these hearings. This amendment addresses one of them.\n  Among the many military personnel I have head from during this \nprocess are Sergeant First Class Luis Rodriguez, his wife Lilliam, and \ntheir two young daughters. Sgt. Rodriguez, with the 101st Airborne, \nstationed out of Fort Campbell, and his family line in Clarksville, TN. \nWhen Sgt. Rodriguez and his family moved to Fort Campbell, they tried \nto get one of their daughters, who was 4 years old at the time, \nenrolled in their local Head Start program before Sgt. Rodriguez\n\n[[Page S7291]]\n\nwas shipped out to Iraq. However, the Rodriguezes were informed that \nthey couldn't access Head Start because they were over-income because \nof receiving the special pay. Sgt. Rodriguez left for Iraq and in \nNovember the truck he was driving in Mosul hit an improvised explosive \ndevice, and he lost most of his right leg. Currently, he is recovering \ndown the road at Walter Reed Medical Center, and Lilliam is spending \nher time among traveling up here to see her husband, tending to her \ngirls in Tennessee, and trying to help provide for her family. I am \nsure if you went to Walter Reed and talked to Lilliam or Luis, they \nwould tell you that there is something wrong when those who wear our \ncountry's uniform and their families can no longer benefit from Head \nStart, the School Lunch Program, or some other federal program because \nthey've become ineligible due to the additional special pay received \nwhen they're off in harm's way protecting our country.\n  I thank the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee \nfor his assistance in crafting this amendment. I look forward to \ncontinuing to work with the chairman on the issue of military families, \nand how best to help them shoulder the burdens they face.\n  We rely on our servicemen and women to defend our freedom and \nAmerica's interests overseas, but at times, we forget that our soldiers \nhave a support structure of their own: their families. We should do all \nwe can to support our service members and their families in these tough \ntimes.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 3441\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, why is this amendment needed? \nCongressional guidance is needed where the Air Force's conduct on its \nTanker Lease Program has, to date, been unacceptable.\n  First, the Air Force has provided Congress inaccurate information in \nan attempt to justify its original proposal to lease 100 Boeing KC-\n767As. For example, Air Force Secretary Jim Roche has repeatedly \nadvised Congress that, in the existing KC-135 fleet, ``corrosion is \nsignificant, pervasive, and represents an unacceptable risk.'' \nSecretary Roche has also emphasized to Congress increased operating \ncosts in the current fleet as a basis for entering into the tanker \nlease. Air Force leadership has indicated that these elements create an \n``urgent'' need to recapitalize the fleet. However, a Defense Science \nBoard, DSB, task force found that the Air Force's claims of \nunmanageable corrosion problems and cost growth were overstated.\n  Remarkably, the task force recommended that corrosion not be cited as \na justification for tanker recapitalization. As such, the task force \nconcluded that ``[t]here is no compelling material or financial reason \nto initiate a replacement program prior to the completion of the \n[Analysis of Alternatives (AoA)] and the [Mobility Capabilities Study \n(MCS)].'' Thus, the task force jettisoned the ``dominant reason'' \nSecretary Roche first cited in his July 10, 2003, report to Congress as \nthe basis for having taxpayers pay billions of dollars more for leasing \ntankers than they would for buying them. The Air Force's \nrepresentations on this issue remains a matter of continuing \ninvestigative concern.\n  In another example, to comply with the original authorizing statute, \nthe Air Force misrepresented to Congress that its proposal to lease 100 \nBoeing KC-767 tankers was merely an operating lease. This would have \nobviated the requirement that the White House obtain advance budget \nauthority for the whole lease proposal. But, the DOD-Office of the \nInspector General, OIG, and Program Analysis and Evaluation, PA, as \nwell as the Congressional Budget Office, CBO, and the General \nAccounting Office, GAO, found that the procurement of these tankers is, \nin fact, a lease-purchase. In addition, facts surrounding the original \nlease proposal made it clear that the transaction was a lease-purchase: \nunder the original proposal, the Air Force conceded that the DOD is \n``committed to earmark[ing] an additional $2B in fiscal year 2008 and \nfiscal year 2009 for the purchase of aircraft covered by the multiyear \nprogram under the terms of the proposed contract'' to head off a \nfunding spike over the Future-Years Defense Program.\n  Second, the DOD-OIG and the National Defense University, NDU, \nconcluded that the Air Force's commercial item procurement strategy \n``prevented any visibility into Boeing's costs and required the Air \nForce to use a fixed-price type contract . . . The strategy also \nexempted [Boeing] from the requirement to submit cost or pricing data. \nThe strategy places the Department at high risk for paying excessive \nprices and precludes good fiduciary responsibility for DOD funds.'' The \nNDU similarly concluded that ``[i]n a sole source, monopoly commercial \nenvironment, the government is not served well with limited price \ndata'' and suggested that the Air Force neglected its fiduciary/\nstewardship responsibilities.\n  Third, the DOD-OIG and the NDU also concluded that the operational \nrequirements document, ORD, for tankers was not tailored, as it should \nhave been, to the requirements of the warfighter, but rather to closely \ncorrelate to the Boeing KC-767A. The DOD-OIG found that senior Air \nForce staff directed that the ORD closely correlate to the Boeing KC-\n767A that was being developed for a foreign government, in anticipation \nof the authorizing legislation. This is particularly troubling where, \naccording to an internal Boeing document regarding the ORD, Boeing \nplanned to ``[e]stablish clearly defined requirements in ORD for the \nUSAF Tanker configuration that results in an affordable solution that \nmeets the USAF mission needs and will prevent an AOA from being \nconducted.'' Under the current proposal, the first 100 tankers produced \nwill not be capable of, among other things, interoperability with Navy, \nMarine, or coalition assets, or simultaneously refueling more than one \nreceiver aircraft. Rear Adm. Mark P. Fitzgerald recently suggested that \nin theater, such a limitation restricts the Navy's long-range striking \ncapability and fosters a needlessly risky aerial refueling environment.\n\n  Finally, documents suggest that the Air Force allowed Boeing to \nmodify the requirements in the ORD while it was being developed. \nDocuments also reflect that the Air Force induced the Joint \nRequirements Oversight Council, JROC, into approving and validating the \ncorrupted ORD by falsely representing that it was not tailored to a \nspecific aircraft. This is of continuing investigative interest to the \nCommittee.\n  As I've described, the history of the Air Force's attempt to \nrecapitalize its tanker fleet has been riddled with corporate scandal, \npublic corruption and political controversy.\n  This amendment attempts to make sure that any effort by the Air Force \nto replace its fleet of tankers is done responsibly. The amendment \nachieves this by doing six things.\n  First, the amendment seeks to have the Secretary of Defense ensure \nthat the Air Force Secretary not acquire any aerial refueling aircraft \nfor the Air Force, by lease or contract, either with full or open \ncompetition, until at least 60 days after the Secretary of Defense has \nreviewed all documentation for the acquisition, including the completed \nAoA, the completed aerial refueling portion of the MCS, a new, \nvalidated capabilities document and the approval of a Defense \nAcquisition Board. And until the Secretary of Defense has submitted to \nthe congressional defense committees a written determination that the \nacquisition is in compliance with all currently applicable laws and \nregulations.\n  Among the authorities with which the acquisition decision must comply \nis OMB Circular A-11, revised for 2003. In other words, without \nsubstantial private-party participation, any third-party financing \narrangement, particularly those structured around a ``special purpose \nentity,'' will be deemed to be a transaction of the government. So, \nunder OMB Circular A-11, the transaction must be reflected in the \nPresident's budget the year that obligations arising from it are \nincurred. The DOD-OIG, the Congressional Budget Office, the \nCongressional Research Service, and others have concluded that the \nproposed lease of tankers is a lease-purchase--for which renegotiation \nof the current contract or independent authorization may be required. \nTherefore, under OMB Circular A-11, budget authority would be needed \nfor the entire obligation in the first year of the lease term.\n  Second, not less than 45 days after the Secretary of Defense submits \nthis\n\n[[Page S7292]]\n\ndetermination, the Comptroller General and the DOD-OIG shall submit to \nthe congressional defense committees a report on whether the \nacquisition complies with all currently applicable laws and \nregulations, as well as the requirements of the amendment itself, and \nis consistent with the AoA and the other documentation referred to in \nthis amendment.\n\n  Third, the acquisition by lease or contract of any aerial refueling \naircraft for the Air Force beyond low-rate initial production shall be \nsubject to (and the Secretary of Defense will comply with) the \nrequirements of sections 2366 and 2399 of title 10, United States Code.\n  Fourth, before selecting the provider of integrated support for the \ntanker fleet, the Secretary of Defense shall perform all analysis \nrequired by law of the costs and benefits of the alternative of using \nFederal Government personnel and contractor personnel to provide such \nsupport. The amendment also requires the Secretary to conduct all \nanalysis required by law of the core logistics requirements, the use of \nperformance-based logistics and the length of the contract period. The \nSecretary of Defense shall then select the provider on the basis of \nfair, full and open competition as defined by the Office of Federal \nProcurement Policy Act.\n  Fifth, before the Secretary of Defense commits to any acquisition of \naerial refueling aircraft, the Secretary shall require the manufacturer \nto provide, with respect to commercial items covered by the lease or \ncontract, information on the prices at which the same or similar items \nhave been sold that is adequate for evaluating the reasonableness of \nthe price for those, and other commercial, items.\n  Finally, the Secretary of the Air Force shall contact the DOD-OIG for \nthe review and approval of any Air Force use of non-Federal audit \nservices for any acquisition of aerial refueling aircraft.\n  A few notes about the amendment.\n  First, this amendment opens the process to oversight by getting the \nDOD-OIG, the DOD-Comptroller General, and the Defense Acquisition \nBoard, DAB, actively involved in the process. Indeed, everyone who has \nindependently looked into how the original proposal went through had \nmajor problems with the lack of transparency. For example, DAB was \ncompletely cut out of the process. As the NDU noted, if allowed to \nparticipate, the DAB would have exercised responsibility over the \nselection of a preferred system alternative, acceptance of the overall \nacquisition strategy, and compliance with applicable policies and \nstatutes. This amendment deals the DAB back in the process to discharge \nits vital function in providing comprehensive senior management review.\n  As another example, under this amendment, the DOD-OIG will determine, \namong other things, whether the data provided by the aircraft and \nengine manufacturer is sufficient to determine the reasonableness of \nthe price of those items. Coupled with the amendment's requirement that \nthe DOD-OIG approve the Air Force's use of an outside auditor, the \ntaxpayers' interests will be protected. Furthermore, I believe that the \nDOD-OIG's, the NDU's, and Institute for Defense Analyses' \nrecommendations that the Air Force Secretary negotiate the price of \nthe engines for the tankers with the engine manufacturers need to be \nimplemented.\n\n  The bottom line here is this. The amendment does much to inject much \nneeded sunlight in a program whose development has been largely \ninsulated from public scrutiny. In so doing, the amendment allows us to \ndischarge our oversight obligations the next time around on this multi-\nbillion dollar procurement proposal, responsibly and effectively.\n  Second, the amendment gives the Secretary of Defense sufficient \nflexibility to pursue a lease only after, among other things, an AoA is \ncompleted. The Secretary has already committed to not going forward on \nreplacing the current fleet until an AoA (and a MCS) are completed. \nWhile giving the Secretary appropriate flexibility, the amendment \nrequires that the Air Force go through certain hoops to make sure that \nany acquisition of tankers in the future, is done the right way. These \nhoops were loosely drawn from the recommendations of the DOD-OIG, the \nDSB, and the NDU, whose input the Secretary specifically asked for. I \nwill have printed a list of findings, conclusions, and recommendations \nby each at the end of this statement. They must all be fully considered \nbefore any decision to recapitalize the tanker fleet is made.\n  Third, it generally requires the DOD and the Air Force to do nothing \nmore than comply with currently applicable statutes, regulations and \nOMB Circulars. Those who looked into the Air Force's conduct regarding \nthe original proposal agreed that the Air Force did not comply extant \nstatutory requirements. This amendment forces the Air Force to do that.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the list to which I referred be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Department of Defense Inspector Generals Acquisition of the Boeing KC-\n                          767A Tanker Aircraft\n\n\n                            recommendations\n\n       Fully develop system engineering requirements to convert \n     the commercial non-developmental aircraft into an integrated \n     military configuration. Without fully developed system \n     engineering requirements the Boeing KC-767A Tanker aircraft \n     may not meet operational requirements for a 40-year service \n     life as well as command, control, communications computers, \n     and intelligence (C4I) support plan requirements, etc.\n       Tailor the first spiral or increment of the Operational \n     Requirements Document (ORD) to warfighter requirements in the \n     mission needs statement (MNS) for future aerial refueling \n     aircraft not a specific aircraft. As a result, the first 100 \n     KC-767A Tankers will not meet the operational requirement for \n     interoperability and will not meet the mission capabilities \n     in the Operational Requirements Document to conduct secondary \n     missions, such as cargo/passenger, aeromedical evacuation \n     mission, etc.\n       The Tanker Lease Program must comply with Sections 2366 and \n     2399 of title 10, United States Code for determining the \n     operational effectiveness, suitability, and survivability of \n     the Boeing 767A tanker aircraft before proceeding beyond low-\n     rate initial production (LRIP).

Contractor \n     selection was a foregone conclusion and was tailored to the \n     Boeing 767 in the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) \n     based on perceived guidance in the FY 2002 Appropriations \n     Act, Section 8159.\n       There is a need to establish a definitive, consistent early \n     requirements statement addressing warfighter needs founded on \n     substantive analysis--this was not done in the Tanker Lease \n     Program.\n       A program that operates in a sole source, commercial \n     environment is especially hard pressed to carry out its \n     charge of ensuring the government receives a fair price.\n       Defense program personnel do have adequate tools or \n     training to obtain the fullest understanding of relevant \n     commercial buying practices in acquisition of military items.\n       Innovation requires top-level management's constant \n     involvement including direction, consultation and \n     responsibility plus timely and frequent meetings of the \n     empowered and the informed.\n       It should be clear that certain regulatory/statutory \n     requirements were waived in the Tanker Lease Program: \n     testing, independent cost estimates, Analysis of \n     Alternatives, DAB approval, etc.\n       The Leasing Review Panel (LRP) was not a substitute for the \n     Defense Acquisition Board (DAB).\n\n\n                            recommendations\n\n       Although leasing is not a preferred strategy, if DOD would \n     pursue a lease, it needs to publish more explicit guidance on \n     leasing in acquisition policy directives and the FAR/DFAR, at \n     a minimum, to include the requirement to:\n       Formulate an early, transparent, comprehensive acquisition \n     processes to be utilized and those to be bypassed with an \n     assessment of associated internal and external risks.\n       Develop an early definitive, consistent requirements \n     statement founded on substantive analysis and supported by a \n     subsequent Analysis of Alternatives (AOA).\n       Establish an acceptable lease financing plan supported by \n     an independent cost estimate (i.e., DOD IG, Comptroller \n     General, etc.)\n       Develop a plan to maximize competition.\n       In all cases, convene a Defense Acquisition Board to \n     provide for comprehensive senior management review.\n       DOD needs to understand when and how commercial buying \n     practices are appropriate to satisfy military needs, if ever.\n       There is a need to establish procedures or authority to \n     require both cost and pricing data for significant sole \n     source, commercial leases or where supplier monopoly power is \n     present. The government is not well served with only price \n     data, particularly in a monopoly-monopsony relationship. \n     Absent real competitive market forces, one cannot rely on \n     pricing data to determine the appropriateness of a \n     transaction. Legitimate monopolies are regulated by detailed \n     cost data and prices are set on that basis. To do otherwise \n     is to place too great a reliance for fair dealing on profit \n     maximizing firms and to ignore the reality that firms \n     appropriately act in their best interest.\n       Regardless of the foregoing, due diligence and fiduciary/\n     stewardship responsibilities cannot be waived.\n       Ensure that an Analysis of Alternatives (AOA) is completed: \n     A less than rigorous exploration/evaluation of alternative \n     solutions than a formal Analysis of Alternatives (AOA) is \n     unsatisfactory. There is no such thing as an ``informal'' \n     AOA.\n       Authors of innovation need to develop action plans to \n     ``accommodate'' those internal\n\n[[Page S7294]]\n\n     and external stakeholders who have a legitimate interest or \n     say in the program. Ignoring such stakeholders, even if \n     allowed by an appropriations act or management direction, is \n     done with some peril and consequence as the stakeholders' \n     unanswered or discounted objections may be encountered \n     later as the program progresses.\n       There is no one, uniform commercial market. Each market has \n     unique features that must be understood in order to obtain \n     the best contract conditions, tailored to each buyer's needs.\n       Ensure the Leasing Panel focuses on ways and means of \n     leasing.\n       The Tanker Lease Program should be approved by a Defense \n     Acquisition Board (DAB) in accordance with DOD regulations.\n       A Defense Acquisition Board (DAB) would have exercised \n     responsibility over the substantive acquisition review issues \n     such as: The selection of the preferred system alternative; \n     acceptance of the overall acquisition strategy; compliance \n     with policy and statute; and would have required a \n     substantial review and documentation to support analyses.\n       Relying on Section 8159 of the FY 2002 Defense \n     Appropriations Act, the USAF/DoD by-passed many elements of \n     the ``normal'' acquisition system. The Tanker Lease Program \n     system solution and the acquisition strategy (i.e., Boeing \n     767 & operating lease scenario) were foregone conclusions \n     based on Section 8159 of the FY 2002 Appropriations Act. The \n     Leasing Review Panel was not an adequate substitute for the \n     Defense Acquisition Board (DAB), which was never convened. \n     Furthermore, the Leasing Review Panel (LRP) never recommended \n     the lease of 100 Boeing 767 tankers.\n       DOD needs to follow cost and pricing guidelines.\n       There should be discussion and debate, within DOD, whether \n     a realistic price was arrived at.\n       The government should not have very limited cost and \n     pricing data.\n       The government should expend considerable time and \n     resources to acquire commercial pricing analysis skills.\n       The Tanker Lease Program approved by DOD made only limited \n     use of considerable government buying power and leverage to \n     obtain maximum discounts.\n       DOD needs to utilize competitive processes, including \n     negotiating directly with the engine manufacturer for \n     engines, the contractor logistics support (CLS) function and \n     the tanker modification. The USAF appeared to rely on Section \n     8159 of the FY 2002 Appropriations Act for commercial sole \n     source authority. Competitive processes were not used in the \n     February 2002 RFI to Boeing and EADS (also a finding of the \n     DOD IG), because there was informal information gathering, \n     and little expectation that Congress would allow leasing of \n     Airbus aircraft. Competitive processes were not used June \n     2002 for the JROC briefing and the Operational Requirements \n     Document (ORD) was written for a specific aircraft. (i.e., \n     Boeing KC-767) and not based on the best capabilities for the \n     warfighter.\n       Publish explicit DOD guidance on leasing to include policy \n     directives and the FAR/DFAR.\n       Innovation requires more, not less up-front planning (e.g., \n     development of an acquisition strategy establishing work-\n     arounds for processes, requirements and stakeholders that are \n     planned to be by-passed.)\n       Establish procedures to require both cost and pricing data \n     on sole source or monopoly, commercial leases.\n       Big ticket acquisitions is a public process, despite the \n     level of innovation, managers must always exercise good \n     stewardship and fiduciary responsibility--this was not the \n     case in the Tanker Lease Program.\n       It is prudent, at a minimum, to develop a full operational \n     testing plan, to perform a much more substantive analysis of \n     alternatives, and to do an independent cost estimate based on \n     cost, not price.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about a very simple \namendment that everyone should support. This amendment requires the \nInspector General of the Department of Defense, DOD-IG, in consultation \nwith the Inspectors General of the State Department and the CIA, to \nconduct a comprehensive investigation into the programs and activities \nof the Iraqi National Congress, INC.\n  Over the last 10 years, we have seen funds from the United States \nGovernment spent in highly questionable, if not fraudulent, ways \nincluding money spent on oil paintings and health club memberships. But \nthis is only the tip of the iceberg. A number of serious questions \nremain unanswered. Here are a couple of examples:\n  First, the INC spent millions in setting up offices around the world, \nincluding London, Prague, Damascus, and Tehran. The State Department's \ninternal documents indicate that they really had no idea of what was \nhappening in some of these offices--especially Tehran. In light of the \nrecent press reports about INC intelligence sharing with Iran, I think \nthe DOD-IG should take a look at this issue and see what was happening \nin the Tehran office. We need to get to the bottom of this.\n  Second, the INC spent millions to set up radio and television \nbroadcasting inside Iraq. The radio program seemed redundant as the \nU.S. Government was, at the time, funding Radio Free Iraq. A New York \nTimes article questioned the effectiveness of the TV broadcasting \nprogram. Kurdish officials indicated that, despite repeated attempts, \nthey could never pick up the INC's TV broadcast inside Iraq. This, \nagain, raises questions about how this money was being spent. The IG \nshould examine this issue. We need to get to the bottom of this.\n  Third, the INC's Information Collection Program--funded initially by \nthe State Department and later by the Defense Department--continues to \nbe a source of controversy and mystery. I have a memo written by the \nINC to Appropriations Committee staff, detailing the INC's Information \nCollection Program. In this memo, the INC claims to have written \nnumerous reports to senior administration officials, who are listed in \nthis memo, on topics including WMD proliferation. The administration \ndisputes this claim. Again, we need to get to the bottom of this.\n  I could go on and on. However, in the interest of time, I will simply \nsay that there are many serious unanswered questions about the INC's \nactivities. What was the INC doing with U.S. taxpayer dollars? What was \ngoing on in the Tehran office? Did the Information Collection Program \ncontribute to intelligence failures in Iraq? Were the broadcasting \nprograms at all effective in gathering support for U.S. efforts in \nIraq?\n  To be sure, there have been a few investigations into INC. However, \nthese have been incomplete offering only a glimpse of what occurred. A \nfew years ago, the State Department Inspector General issued two \nreports the INC. But these reports only covered $4.3 million and \nexamined only the Washington and London offices. The State Department \nIG informed my office yesterday that these are the only two audits they \nconducted and have no plans to conduct future audits on this issue.\n  A GAO report, published earlier this year, summarized the different \ngrant agreements that the State Department entered into with the INC, \nbut this report did not attempt to answer the myriad questions that \nremain about the INC.\n  Another GAO report is underway, but this looks only at the narrow \nquestion of whether the INC violated U.S. laws concerning the use of \ntaxpayer funds to pay for publicity or propaganda.\n  Finally, according to press reports, the Intelligence Committee is \nlooking into a few issues related to the INC. My amendment is \nconsistent with these investigations. The DOD-IG does not have to re-\ninvent the wheel. It can build off this existing body of work to answer \nquestions that will remain long after these investigations have been \ncompleted.\n  My amendment is about transparency. My amendment is about \naccountability. My amendment is about getting to the bottom of one of \nthe most mismanaged programs in recent history. Most importantly, my \namendment is about learning from our mistakes so we do not repeat them \nin the past. I urge my colleagues to support my amendment.\n\n\n                    amendment no. 3399, as modified\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the chairman and the ranking \nmember of the Armed Services Committee for working with me to accept \nthis amendment, which represents a first step toward enhancing and \nstrengthening transition services that are provided to our military \npersonnel. I also thank my cosponsor, the Senator from Maine, Ms. \nSnowe, for her contributions to this amendment.\n  As we debate the Department of Defense authorization bill today, \nthousands of our brave men and women in uniform are in harm's way in \nIraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere around the globe. These men and women \nserve with distinction and honor, and we owe them our heartfelt \ngratitude.\n  We also owe them our best effort to ensure that they receive the \nbenefits to which their service in our Armed Forces has entitled them. \nI have heard time and again from military personnel and veterans who \nare frustrated with the system by which they apply for benefits or \nappeal claims for benefits. I have long been concerned that\n\n[[Page S7295]]\n\ntens of thousands of our veterans are unaware of Federal health care \nand other benefits for which they may be eligible, and I have \nundertaken numerous legislative and oversight efforts to ensure that \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs makes outreach to our veterans and \ntheir families a priority.\n  While we should do more to support our veterans, we must also ensure \nthat the men and women who are currently serving in our Armed Forces \nreceive adequate pay and benefits, as well as services that help them \nto make the transition from active duty to civilian life. I am \nconcerned that we are not doing enough to support our men and women in \nuniform as they prepare to retire or otherwise separate from the \nservice or, in the case of members of our National Guard and Reserve, \nto demobilize from Active Duty assignments and return to their civilian \nlives while staying in the military or preparing to separate from the \nmilitary. We must ensure that their service and sacrifice, which is \nmuch lauded during times of conflict, is not forgotten once the battles \nhave ended and our troops have come home.\n  For those reasons, last month, I introduced the Veterans Enhanced \nTransition Services Act, VETS Act, which would improve transition \nservices for our military personnel. My legislation would help to \nensure that all military personnel receive the same services by making \na number of improvements to the existing Transition Assistance Program/\nDisabled Transition Assistance Program, TAP/DTAP, and to the Benefits \nDelivery at Discharge program, by improving the process by which \nmilitary personnel who are being demobilized or discharged receive \nmedical examinations and mental health assessments, and by ensuring \nthat military and veterans service organizations and State departments \nof veterans affairs are able to play an active role in assisting \nmilitary personnel with the difficult decisions that are often involved \nin the process of discharging or demobilizing.\n  I am pleased that my original legislation is supported by a wide \nrange of groups that are dedicated to serving our men and women in \nuniform and veterans and their families. These groups include: the \nAmerican Legion; the Enlisted Association of the National Guard of the \nUnited States; the Paralyzed Veterans of America; the Reserve Officers \nAssociation; the Veterans of Foreign Wars; the Wisconsin Department of \nVeterans Affairs; the Wisconsin National Guard; the American Legion, \nDepartment of Wisconsin; Disabled American Veterans, Department of \nWisconsin; the Wisconsin Paralyzed Veterans of America; the Veterans of \nForeign Wars, Department of Wisconsin; and the Wisconsin State Council, \nVietnam Veterans of America. I will continue to work with these and \nother veterans and military organizations on these important issues.\n  The amendment that I am offering today on behalf of myself and \nSenator Snowe is based on that legislation. This amendment will require \nthe General Accounting Office, GAO, to undertake a comprehensive \nanalysis of existing transition services for our military personnel \nthat are administered by the Departments of Defense, Veterans Affairs, \nand Labor and to make recommendations to Congress on how these programs \ncan be improved.\n  This study will focus on two issues: how to achieve the uniform \nprovision of appropriate transition services to all military personnel, \nand the role of postdeployment and predischarge health assessments as \npart of the larger transition program.\n  I have heard from a number of Wisconsinites and members of military \nand veterans service organizations that our men and women in uniform do \nnot all have access to the same transition counseling and medical \nservices as they are demobilizing from service in Iraq, Afghanistan, \nand elsewhere. I have long been concerned about reports of uneven \nprovision of services from base to base and from service to service. \nAll of our men and women in uniform have pledged to serve our country, \nand all of them, at the very least, deserve to have access to the same \nservices in return.\n  This amendment will require GAO to conduct an analysis of transition \nprograms, including a history of how the programs were intended to be \nused when they were created and how they are being used now; whether \nthe programs adequately address the specific needs of military \npersonnel, including members of the National Guard and Reserve; and how \ntransition programs differ among the services and across military \ninstallations. The GAO will also be required to make recommendations on \nhow these programs can be improved, including an analysis of additional \ninformation that would be beneficial to members participating in \ntransition briefings.\n  Under current law, the Department of Defense, together with the \nDepartments of Veterans Affairs--VA--and Labor, provide preseparation \ncounseling for military personnel who are preparing to leave the \nservice. This counseling provides service members with valuable \ninformation about benefits that they have earned through their service \nto our country such as education benefits through the GI Bill and \nhealth care and other benefits through the VA. Personnel also learn \nabout programs such as Troops to Teachers and have access to employment \nassistance for themselves and, where appropriate, their spouses.\n  Currently, participation in this program is encouraged, but not \nmandatory. Thus, most of the responsibility for getting information \nabout benefits and programs falls on the military personnel themselves. \nParticipation in preseparation counseling through a TAP/DTAP program is \na valuable tool for personnel as they transition back to civilian life. \nThe Department of Defense should make every effort to ensure that all \nmembers participate in this important program, and my amendment would \nrequire the GAO to analyze participation rates and make recommendations \non how the Department of Defense could better encourage participation, \nand whether participation in a transition program should be mandatory.\n  In addition, GAO would be required to make recommendations on any \ninformation that should be added to the transition briefings, such as \ninformation on procurement opportunities for veterans with service-\nconnected disabilities and for other veterans. I thank the Senator from \nMaine, Ms. Snowe, the chairman of the Small Business Committee, for \nmaking the important point that Federal law requires that a certain \npercentage of contracts be awarded to firms owned by veterans with \nservice-connected disabilities. Additionally, the Small Business \nAdministration and other agencies administer programs to make all \nveterans aware of procurement opportunities. I agree with her that the \ntransition process is a commonsense place to make these personnel aware \nof these opportunities. For that reason, our amendment also requires \nthat the Department of Defense include information about these \ncontracting opportunities in its transition program.\n  The amendment would also require the GAO to study how the transition \nprograms administered by the VA and by the Department of Labor fit into \nthis transition effort. This analysis would include a discussion of the \njoint DOD-VA Benefits Delivery at Discharge program, which assists \npersonnel in applying for VA disability benefits before they are \ndischarged from the military. This very successful program has helped \nto cut the redtape and to speed the processing time for many veterans \nwho are entitled to VA disability benefits.\n  In addition, under current law, the Secretary of Defense may make use \nof the services provided by military and veterans service organizations \nas part of the transition process. But these groups tell me that they \nare not always allowed access to transition briefings that are \nconducted for our personnel. For that reason, this amendment would \nrequire GAO to include an analysis of the participation of military and \nveterans service organizations in preseparation briefings, including \nrecommendations on how the Department of Defense could make better use \nof representatives of veterans service organizations who are recognized \nby the Secretary of Veterans Affairs for the representation of military \npersonnel in VA proceedings.\n  The demobilization and discharge process presents our service members \nwith a sometimes confusing and often overwhelming amount of information \nand paperwork that must be digested and sometimes signed in a very \nshort period of time. The opportunity to\n\n[[Page S7296]]\n\nspeak with fellow veterans who have been through this process and who \nhave been accredited to represent veterans in VA proceedings by the VA \ncan be invaluable to military personnel as they seek to wade through \nthis maze of paperwork. These veterans can offer important advice about \nbenefits and other choices that military personnel have to make as they \nare being discharged or demobilized. I commend the Senator from \nLouisiana, Ms. Landrieu, for offering an amendment which has already \nbeen accepted to this bill that reaffirms the importance of allowing \nveterans service organizations to participate in transition briefings \nand that also encourages their involvement in counseling members of the \nNational Guard and Reserve who have been demobilized. The Landrieu \namendment is consistent with provisions in my legislation, the VETS \nAct, and I am pleased that the Senate has gone on record in support of \nallowing these dedicated members of our veterans service organizations, \nwho have taken the time to get accredited by the Secretary of Veterans \nAffairs in order to counsel and represent their fellow veterans, to \nparticipate in transition briefings.\n  In addition to the uneven provision of transition services, I have \nlong been concerned about the immediate and long-term health effects \nthat military deployments have on our men and women in uniform. I \nregret that, too often, the burden of responsibility for proving that a \ncondition is related to military service falls on the personnel \nthemselves. Our men and women in uniform deserve the benefit of the \ndoubt, and should not have to fight the Department of Defense or the VA \nfor benefits that they have earned through their service to our Nation.\n  Part of the process of protecting the health of our men and women in \nuniform is to ensure that the Department of Defense carries out its \nresponsibility to provide postdeployment physicals for military \npersonnel. I am deeply concerned about stories of personnel who are \nexperiencing long delays as they wait for their postdeployment \nphysicals and who end up choosing not to have these important physicals \nin order to get home to their families that much sooner. I am equally \nconcerned about reports that some personnel who did not receive such a \nphysical--either by their own choice or because such a physical was not \navailable--are now having trouble as they apply for benefits for a \nservice-connected condition.\n  I am pleased that the underlying bill contains a provision that would \nrequire postdeployment physicals for military personnel who are \nseparating from Active-Duty service. I firmly believe, as do the \nmilitary and veterans groups that support my VETS Act legislation, that \nour men and women in uniform are entitled to a prompt, high quality \nphysical examination as part of the demobilization process. These \nindividuals have voluntarily put themselves in harm's way for our \nbenefit. We should ensure that the Department of Defense makes every \neffort to determine whether they have experienced--or could \nexperience--any health effects as a result of their service.\n  I am also pleased that the Senate has already adopted an amendment \noffered by the Senator from New York, Mrs. Clinton, and the Senator \nfrom Missouri, Mr. Talent, that will help to improve the medical \nreadiness of our men and women in uniform and to ensure their health is \nmonitored before, during, and after deployments so that there is a \nrecord of any service-connected conditions or exposures.\n  Building on this effort, my amendment would require the GAO to \ninclude in its study of transition services an analysis of the use of \npostdeployment and predischarge health screenings and whether and how \nthese screenings and the transition program could be integrated into a \nsingle, coordinated preseparation program for military personnel who \nare being discharged or released from active duty. The analysis would \nalso include information on how postdeployment questionnaires are used, \nthe extent to which military personnel waive physical exams, and how \nand the extent to which personnel are referred for followup health \ncare.\n  I am also concerned about the implementation of current law with \nrespect to the current requirement that postdeployment medical \nexaminations include a mental health assessment. Our men and women in \nuniform serve in difficult circumstances far from home, and too many of \nthem witness or experience violence and horrific situations that most \nof us cannot even begin to imagine. These men and women, many of whom \nare just out of high school or college when they sign up, may suffer \nlong-term physical and mental fallout from their experiences and may \nfeel reluctant to seek counseling or other assistance to deal with \ntheir experiences.\n  We can and should do more to ensure that the mental health of our men \nand women in uniform is a top priority, and that the stigma that is too \noften attached to seeking assistance is ended. To that end, this \namendment requires that GAO include in its analysis a discussion of the \ncurrent process by which mental health screenings are conducted, \nfollowup mental health care is provided for, and services are provided \nin cases of posttraumatic stress disorder and related conditions in \nconnection with discharge and release from active duty. This will \ninclude an analysis of the number of persons treated, the types of \ninterventions, and the programs that are in place for each branch of \nthe Armed Forces to identify and treat cases of PTSD and related \nconditions.\n  As part of its study on these important issues, GAO is directed to \nobtain views from the Secretary of Defense and the Secretaries of the \nmilitary departments; the Secretaries of Veterans Affairs and Labor; \nmilitary personnel who have received the transition assistance programs \ncovered by this study and personnel who have declined to participate in \nthese transition programs; representatives of military and veterans \nservice organizations; and persons with expertise in health care, \nincluding mental health care, provided under the Defense Health \nProgram, including personnel from the Departments of Defense and \nVeterans Affairs and persons in the private sector.\n  Finally, in response to concerns I have heard from a number of my \nconstituents, this amendment also directs the Secretaries of Defense \nand Labor to jointly report to Congress on ways in which DOD training \nand certification standards could be coordinated with Government and \nprivate-sector training and certification standards for corresponding \ncivilian occupations.\n  Again, I thank the chairman and the ranking member of the committee \nfor working with me to include these provisions in the bill. I will \ncontinue to work to ensure that we provide those serving in our Armed \nForces with the help they need and deserve in making the often-\ndifficult transition back to civilian life.\n\n\n                     military housing privatization\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss a very \nimportant matter to me, to my home State of Georgia and to our Nation's \nmilitary. A few years ago this Congress authorized the military housing \nprivatization initiative. This program, which brings to bear private \nsector experience and financial strength to improve the quality of life \nfor our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines and their families, has been \na resounding success. To date, the U.S. Armed Forces have privatized \nover 60,000 housing units, leveraging more than $10 for every \nGovernment dollar invested. Out-dated, and World War II era, housing is \nbeing replaced with modern homes and amenities that our servicemen and \nwomen so richly deserve. This process is taking place across the \ncountry, from Camp Pendleton Marine Corps Base in California to Fort \nBragg in North Carolina to Fort Benning, GA.\n  However, there is an issue which threatens the livelihood and \nprogress of this program and which the Congress must act now to \naddress. The way the Congressional Budget Office is scoring \nexpenditures for this program causes the program to exceed the \nauthorized spending cap. The CBO scoring assumes that the Government \nguarantees and the management of the housing projects in question have \ndirect budget implications. However, military families sign leases and \nrent the units and private companies assume the investment risk, so the \nCBO scoring, incorrectly in my opinion, treats these costs as an \nobligation on behalf of the Government. I believe we need to either \nsignificantly raise the current cost cap for the program or eliminate \nit entirely in order to make available an\n\n[[Page S7297]]\n\nadequate funding stream to see this important project through to \ncompletion.\n  The Department of Defense has established a master plan which will \nprivatize approximately 160,000-170,000, or over 70 percent, of \nexisting family housing units. Currently, DoD is about half way towards \ncompleting that goal. We should allow this well-functioning program to \ncontinue for the benefit of our men and women in uniform, and we should \nfollow the traditional scoring guidelines which we have used for the \npast 5 years in order to accurately determine the actual costs.\n  I thank the Chair for the opportunity to discuss this very important \nissue, and I look forward to working with my colleagues in the relevant \ncommittees to resolve this situation in a positive manner.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I support passage of this year's Defense \nauthorization bill because it contains many provisions that our brave \nmen and women in uniform need and deserve. But before I go into the \ndetails of why I am supporting this legislation, I must first thank the \nmembers of the United States Armed Forces for their service to our \ncountry. They are performing admirably under difficult circumstances \nall over the world. Our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines, along \nwith their families, are making great sacrifices in service to our \ncountry. I am voting for this legislation to support these people who \nare serving the country with such courage.\n  I strongly support the 3.5 percent across-the-board pay raise for \nmilitary personnel that this bill provides. We must make sure that our \nprofessional military is paid a fair wage. This bill also makes \npermanent the increase in family separation allowance and imminent \ndanger pay, another important policy for our men and women in uniform. \nOnce again, I was proud to support the expansion of full-time TRICARE \nhealth insurance for our National Guard and Reserve. The reserve \ncomponent is being used more than at any other time since World War II. \nForty percent of our troops in Iraq are reserve component troops. These \ncitizen soldiers face additional burdens when they transition in and \nout of their civilian life and providing them and their families with \nTRICARE is one way we can ease those burdens.\n  Another aspect of this bill that I strongly support is the increased \nfunding for force protection equipment. Last year, concerned \nWisconsinites contacted my office telling me that they or their \ndeployed loved ones were fighting for their country in Iraq without the \nequipment they needed. This situation is unconscionable. I have \nrepeatedly pressed the Pentagon to fix this situation and I and my \ncolleagues went a long way in addressing these shortages in the \nsupplemental spending bill for Iraq and Afghanistan. The $925 million \nfor additional up-armored HUMVEES and other ballistic protection as \nwell as the $600 million in force protection gear and combat clothing \nin this bill above what was in the President's proposed budget further \nensures that our troops have the equipment they need to perform their \nduties on the ground.\n  I am pleased that the Senate approved my amendment to ensure that the \nInspector General for the Coalition Provisional Authority will continue \nto oversee U.S. reconstruction efforts in Iraq after June 30 of this \nyear as the Special Inspector General for Iraq reconstruction. The \nAmerican taxpayers have been asked to shoulder a tremendous burden in \nIraq, and we must ensure that their dollars are spent wisely and \nefficiently. Today, the CPA is phasing out, but the reconstruction \neffort has only just begun. As of mid-May, only $4.2 billion of the \n$18.4 billion that Congress appropriated for reconstruction in November \nhad even been obligated. With multiple agencies involved and a budget \nthat exceeds the entire foreign operations appropriation for this \nfiscal year, U.S. taxpayer-funded reconstruction efforts should have a \nfocused oversight effort. My amendment will ensure that the Inspector \nGeneral's office can continue its important work even after June 30, \nrather than being compelled to start wrapping up and shutting down \nwhile so much remains to be done. This is good news for the \nreconstruction effort, and good news for American taxpayers.\n  I also want to thank the chairman and the ranking member of the Armed \nServices Committee for working with me to accept the amendment that I \noffered with the Senator from Maine, Ms. Snowe, which represents a \nfirst step toward enhancing and strengthening transition services that \nare provided to our military personnel. This amendment will require the \nGeneral Accounting Office to undertake a comprehensive analysis of \nexisting transition services for our military personnel that are \nadministered by the Department of Defense, Veterans Affairs, and Labor \nand to make recommendations to Congress on how these programs can be \nimproved. This study will focus on two issues: how to achieve the \nuniform provision of appropriate transition services to all military \npersonnel, and the role of post-deployment and pre-discharge health \nassessments as part of the large transition program. I very much look \nforward to reviewing the results of this study.\n  The Senate version of the Defense authorization bill also includes a \nprovision finally fulfilling a goal for which I have been fighting for \nyears--making sure that every State and territory has at least one \nWeapons of mass Destruction Civil Support Team, WMD-CST. I was \ndelighted earlier this year when Wisconsin was chosen as one of 12 \nStates to receive a WMD-CST authorized and appropriated for in FY2004, \nbut I was also disappointed that the President's proposed budget for \nFY2005 included funding for only 4 of the 11 outstanding teams. I, \nalong with 28 of my colleagues, wrote the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee chairman and ranking member asking them to fully fund all 11 \nremaining teams. The chairman and ranking member have been very \nsupportive of my efforts in this area over the years, and I thank them \nagain this year for funding all 11 remaining WMD-CSTs.\n  This authorization bill addresses the grave threat our Nation faces \nfrom unsecured nuclear materials. It includes $409 million for the \nCooperative Threat Reduction program and $1.3 billion for the \nDepartment of Energy nonproliferation programs. I was also proud to \ncosponsor the amendment offered by Senator Domenici and Senator \nFeinstein that authorizes the Department of Energy to secure the tons \nof fissile material scattered around the world. This bipartisan \ninitiative aims to dramatically accelerate current efforts to the \nworld. This bipartisan initiative aims to dramatically accelerate \ncurrent efforts to secure this dangerous material so that it cannot \nfall into the hands of those who aim to harm us. Time is of essence, \nand I was pleased to hear that the administration is fully supportive \nof this efforts through the Global Threat Reduction Initiative.\n  I also voted for an amendment offered by Senator Reed that boosts the \nArmy's end strength by 20,000. I did so because it has become clear \nthat the Army is currently overstretched, and I believe that we need to \nensure readiness to handle threats in the future. A recent Brookings \nInstitution report says that the military is being stretched so thin \nthat if we don't expand its size, it could break the back of our all-\nvolunteer Army. One does not have to support all of the deployment \ndecisions that brought us to this point today to see that we need to \nhave the capacity to handle multiple crises with sufficient manpower \nand strength. I do not take lightly the decision to lock in a \nsignificant increase in spending. The need is great, however, and the \ndeliberative defense authorization process, not the emergency \nsupplemental process, is the place to do it.\n  I must note that, unfortunately, this bill has many of the same \nproblems that I've been fighting to fix for years. Once again, we are \nspending billions upon billions of dollars for weapons systems more \nsuited for the Cold War than the fight against terrorism. I was very \ndisappointed that the Senate did not agree to Senator Levin's amendment \nthat would have used a small percentage of the over $10 billion \nauthorized for missile defense for critical unfunded homeland defense \nneeds. This amendment, which I cosponsored, would have used $515.5 \nmillion now slated for additional untested interceptors and spent it \ninstead on the top unfunded Department of Defense homeland defense \npriorities, research and development programs, radiation detection \nequipment at seaports, and\n\n[[Page S7298]]\n\nother important defenses against terrorism. Budgeting is about setting \npriorities and I am sad to say that when the Senate failed to adopt \nSenator Levin's amendment, it missed a golden opportunity to adjust its \npriorities in order to face our country's most pressing threat--the \nthreat of terrorism.\n  I was disappointed that the Senate failed to reduce the retirement \nage for those in the National Guard and Reserve from 60 to 55. Our \ncountry has placed unprecedented demands upon the Guard and Reserve \nsince September 11, 2001, and will continue to do so for the \nforeseeable future. Considering the demands we are placing on them, it \nis time that we lower the Guard and Reserve's retirement age to the \nsame level as civilian Federal employees.\n  Although my support for reducing the reserve component retirement age \nhas been unwavering, because of the significant budgetary impact of \nthis measure I had hoped that Congress would first receive reviews of \nreserve compensation providing all of the information that we need to \naddress this issue responsibly. I patiently waited for several studies \non this issue, including by the Defense Department, but when the \nstudies came out they called for further study. This matter cannot \ncontinue to languish unaddressed indefinitely. As retired U.S. Air \nForce Colonel Steve Strobridge, government relations director for the \nMilitary Officers Association of America, MOAA, put it, ``It is time to \nfish or cut bait.'' I agree with MOAA's analysis that, ``Further delay \non this important practical and emotional issue poses significant risks \nto long-term (Guard and Reserve) retention'' and I was proud to vote \nfor the amendment offered by the Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Corzine.\n  I also believe that the Senate missed an opportunity to provide a \nsmall but needed measure of relief to military families when it failed \nto adopt my Military Family Leave Act amendment. This amendment would \nhave allowed a spouse, child, or parent who already qualifies for \nFamily and Medical Leave Act, FMLA benefits--unpaid leave--to use those \nexisting benefits for issues directly arising from the deployment of a \nfamily member. The Senate adopted a similar amendment by unanimous \nconsent when I offered it to the Iraq supplemental spending bill. This \namendment has the support of the Military Officers Association of \nAmerica, the Enlisted Association of the National Guard of the United \nStates, the Reserve Officers Association, the National Guard \nAssociation of the United States, the National Military Family \nAssociation, and the National Partnership for Women and Families.\n  I regret that a harmful second degree amendment was offered to my \namendment and that I was not given the opportunity to have a straight \nup or down vote. Rather than taking up the Senate's time in a \nprotracted debate about the second degree amendment, I withdrew my \namendment so that this important Defense authorization bill could move \nforward. However, the need addressed by my amendment remains, and I \nwill continue to fight to bring some relief to military families that \nsacrifice so much for all of us.\n  I want to bring attention to another element of the Defense \nAuthorization bill that raises concerns for me. The Defense \nAuthorization bill includes language that raises troop caps in Colombia \nfrom 400 to 800 military personnel and from 400 civilian contractors to \n600. I am disappointed that Senator Byrd's amendment was not approved \nby the Senate, which would have limited the increases in these caps to \nthe levels established by the bill. Most importantly, I worry about \nplacing more Americans in harm's way in Colombia. Further deployments \nbring greater risks to an already overstretched military. We do not \nwant to risk being drawn further into Colombia's civil war--certainly \nnot without a thorough debate that the American people can follow. In \naddition, many of my constituents and I remain concerned that by \nraising these caps, the U.S. devotes greater resources to the military \nside of the equation in Colombia without balancing our approach through \ngreater support for democratic institutions, increasing economic \ndevelopment, and supporting human rights.\n  There are other provisions in this bill with which I disagree, and \nthe Senate rejected a number of amendments that would have made this \nbill better. However, on balance this legislation contains many good \nprovisions for our men and women in uniform and their families and that \nis why I will vote for it.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I strongly support the passage of S. 2400, \nthe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005. This \nlegislation funds $422.2 billion for defense programs, which is a 3.4 \npercent increase or $20.9 billion above the amount approved by Congress \nlast year. I commend the bill managers, Senators Warner and Levin, for \ntheir leadership both in the Committee and on the floor these past \nweeks. This is a very important bill, and I am pleased we are about to \nproceed to final passage.\n  Yesterday, I had a lengthy statement on the Boeing 767 Tanker Lease \nProgram so I will not take up more of the Senate's time now, except to \nsay that the amendment that was included in this bill is critical \nbecause congressional guidance is needed where the Air force's conduct \non its Tanker Lease Program has, to date, been unacceptable. With \nregard to the Boeing 767 Tanker Lease Program, the Department of \nDefense and the Air Force leadership have obfuscated, delayed, and \nwithheld information from Congress and the taxpayers. Therefore, the \ntanker amendment attempts to make sure that any effort by the Air Force \nto replace its fleet of tankers is done responsibly. We should expect \nno less from the Air Force.\n  The adopted amendment does much to inject needed sunlight on a \nprogram whose development has been largely insulated from public \nscrutiny. It will allow us to discharge responsibly and effectively our \noversight obligations the next time around on this multi-billion dollar \nprocurement proposal.\n  The men and women of our nation's Armed Forces put their lives on the \nline every day to protect the very freedoms we as Americans hold dear. \nIt is our obligation to provide key quality of life benefits to the \nmembers of our military. Great strides will be made by this bill \ntowards accomplishing that goal. For example, this bill authorizes a \n3.5 percent across-the-board pay raise for all military personnel. It \nalso repeals the requirement for military members to pay subsistence \ncharges while hospitalized, and adds $7.8 million for expanded care and \nservices at the Walter Reed Amputee Patient Care Center. Also included \nin the legislation is a permanent increase in the rate of family \nseparation allowance from $100 per month to $250 per month as well as a \npermanent increase in the rate of special pay for duty subject to \nhostile fire or imminent danger from $150 per month to $225 per month.\n  We continue to be increasingly reliant on the men and women of our \nReserve forces and National Guard. In fact, 40 percent of all the \nground troops in Iraq and Afghanistan are composed of National Guard \nand Reserve forces as well as nearly all of the ground forces in \nKosovo, Bosnia, and the Sinai. Many of these soldiers and sailors leave \nbehind friends, families, and careers to defend our Nation. \nAccordingly, it is the responsibility of policy makers to ensure that \nwe look after the needs of these patriots. Included in the legislation \nis the authorization for full medical and dental examinations and \nrequisite inoculations when reservists mobilize and demobilize as well \nas a new requirement for pre-separation physical examinations for \nmembers of the reserve component. This provision is critical to \nmaintain, and in some circumstances, will help to increase the \nreadiness of the Total Force.\n  The Senate also adopted an important amendment to authorize an \nincrease in the size of our Army by 20,000. This increase is absolutely \nvital in our Army's ability to carry out its mission in the Global War \non Terror. There is no shortage of evidence supporting an increase in \nArmy end strength. Recently, the Army pulled 3,600 troops out of South \nKorea to fill critical needs in Iraq. The Army is also looking to \ndeploy to Iraq the 11th Armored Calvary Regiment. This is an elite unit \nthat serves in desert training exercises. In addition, for the first \ntime in over 10 years, the Army is pulling people out of the Individual \nReady Reserve to fill critical needs. The Department of Defense should \nbe able to move troops around as needed to address critical needs, \nhowever, in this instance, we are sacrificing our readiness on the \nKorean\n\n[[Page S7299]]\n\npeninsula because we do not have enough soldiers serving in the Army.\n  After returning home for a short period of time, soldiers and Marines \nare already making preparations for their second tour in Iraq or \nAfghanistan in as many years. This is not good for morale, this is not \ngood for retention, this is not good for readiness, and this is not \ngood for the soldier's families. Eventually, recruitment will be \nseriously affected by these trends.\n  Additionally, the Army recently announced a new stop-loss policy. \nWhile I certainly recognize the Army's authority and necessity to issue \nstop loss orders, their issuance in this instance is yet another reason \nwhy we need to increase the size of the Army. For all the benefits in \ngroup cohesion that results from extended tours, the Army will be \nfacing a serious crisis when it comes time for these soldiers to \nreenlist on their own accord. I am concerned about the effect that \nthese stop-loss orders will have on the morale of our Army. While I \nstill do not believe that we need a draft, we do need to increase the \nsize of the Army to carry out important defense missions.\n  These are some aspects of this legislation that I do not support. For \nexample, once again, this bill lent the opportunity for protectionist \nBuy America amendments. In a similar fashion as last year, the Senate \nhad to beat back an amendment that sought to protect parochial \ninterests at the cost of our defense industry and American jobs. It \nseems as if every year, we fight the same fight on the Senate floor.\n  A sound policy which the Senate has adopted in the past is that we \nneed to provide American servicemen and women with the best equipment \nat the best price for the American taxpayer. This is the policy we need \nto continue to follow.\n  The international considerations of this amendment are immense. such \nan isolationist, go-it-alone approach would have serious consequences \non our relationship with our allies. Furthermore, our country is \nthreatened when we ignore our trade agreements. Currently, the U.S. \nenjoys a trade balance in defense exports of 6-to-1 in its favor with \nrespect to Europe, and about 12-to-1 with respect to the rest of the \nworld. We don't need protectionist measures to insulate our defense or \naerospace industries. If we stumble down the road of protectionist \npolicies, our allies will retaliate and the ability to sell U.S. \nequipment as a means to greater interoperability with NATO and non-NATO \nallies would be seriously undercut. Critical international programs, \nsuch as the Joint Strike Fighter and missile defense, would likely be \nterminated as our allies reassess our defense cooperative trading \nrelationship.\n\n  On another important policy consideration, the Senate also \nsuccessfully defeated an amendment aimed at canceling the upcoming BRAC \nround. BRAC has taken on a new significance in the War against Terror. \nNever has there been a time in recent memory when it has been more \nimportant not to waste money on non-essential expenditures. To continue \nto sustain an infrastructure that exceeds our strategic and tactical \nneeds will make less funding available to the forces that we are \nrelying on to destroy the international network of terrorism.\n  The Department of Defense has come out with very fair and reasonable \ncriteria used to select what bases are chosen for BRAC. I have every \nconfidence the Secretary of Defense will carry out this round of BRAC \nin a just and consistent manner. Sooner or later, surplus bases must be \nclosed. Delaying or canceling BRAC would only make the process more \ndifficult and painful than need be. The sooner the issue is addressed, \nthe greater will be the savings that will ultimately go toward defense \nmodernization and better pay and benefits for our hard-working service \nmembers.\n  I understand some of my colleagues may be concerned about the \npotential negative effects a base closure may have on their local \neconomy. Previous base closure rounds have had many success stories. \nFor example, after England Air Force Base closed in 1992, Alexandria, \nLA, benefited from the creation of over 1,400 jobs--nearly double the \nnumber of jobs lost. Across the U.S., about 60,000 new jobs have been \ncreated at closing military bases. At bases closed more than 2 years, \nnearly 75 percent of the civilian jobs have been replaced. This is not \nto say that base closures are easy for any community, but it does \nsuggest that communities can and will continue to thrive.\n  Americans are blessed with nearly limitless freedoms and liberties. \nIn exchange for all our country gives to us, it does not demand much in \nreturn. Yet throughout our history, millions of people have volunteered \nto give back to their nation through military service. The selfless \nacts of courage and sacrifice made by the men and women in our armed \nservices have elevated our Nation to the greatness we enjoy today.\n  America is defined not by its power but by its ideals. One of the \ngreat strengths of the American public is the desire to serve a cause \ngreater than our own self interest. All too often, our younger \ngenerations are accused of selfishness and an unwillingness to \nsacrifice. I disagree. I see generations of people yearning to serve \nand help their fellow citizens. Each year, thousands of our young \nAmericans decide to dedicate a few years or even a full career to \nprotecting the rights and liberties of others. They often do this with \nvery real risks to their lives. They volunteer to do this not for \nprofit, nor for self-promotion, but out of a sense of duty, service, \nand patriotism.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to thank so many who made possible \nthe next vote. First, our leadership and the members of our committee, \nour committee staff, and particularly my distinguished ranking member, \nwith a special thanks to both the Democratic whip and the Republican \nwhip for their special time on the floor.\n  I ask for the third reading of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Objection is heard.\n  Without objection, H.R. 4200, as amended, is passed.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, that concludes the matters addressing the \nbill. I thank the leadership of both sides, members of our committee, \nand the wonderful, fine staff we have, particularly my staff, Mrs. \nAnsley, and my good colleague over here, my partner for these 26 years \nwe have been in the Senate. Guess we landed another one, not \nnecessarily in record time. Our calculation is 16 legislative days. So \nperhaps we have set something of a record as the days were fairly \nconsecutive.\n  I thank the chief of staff sitting here.\n  Thank you, Captain.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, as always, the Senate is very much in the \ndebt of our chairman, John Warner, an extraordinary human being and \nleader. This could not have happened without his leadership.\n  My staff, Dick Debobes, and all of our minority staff deserve \nextraordinary credit for getting this done. It would have taken twice \nas long but for our staff. I don't know--16 legislative days. It would \nhave been double that number of days but for our staff, Judy Ansley and \nher staff. We thank them. Our staff worked together on a bipartisan \nbasis. The Nation and our men and women in the Armed Forces owe them a \nhuge debt. It is our staff--they will never know the names of our \nstaff, probably, but they will be safer, more secure, better trained, \nbetter equipped, and have better benefits because of the work of our \nstaff and the members of our committee who worked on a bipartisan basis \nunder the leadership of John Warner.\n  Again, I take my hat off to our chairman. He has really done a \nwonderful job on this bill. It took a little longer than expected, but \nagain we worked through a huge number of amendments, perhaps a record \nnumber of amendments.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my friend. These many years we have worked, \nreally, as partners, and achieved one of the highest degrees of \nbipartisanship in the discharge of our respective responsibilities, \ntogether with the staffs.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we would not be at this point in our \ndeliberations were it not for the extraordinary work and cooperation on \na bipartisan basis of all of our committee members and all of our \ncommittee staff. Once again, our Committee and the Senate have put the \ninterests of our country first and we all can be very proud of that.\n  I take just a moment to acknowledge and thank the minority staff \nmembers of the Committee on Armed Services for their extraordinary work \non S. 2400, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n2005. You don't get to final passage of this massive and important bill \nwithout having staff who are willing to give hours and hours of hard \nwork and make many personal sacrifices. The committee and the Senate \nare so fortunate to have men and women of their expertise and \ndedication so ably assisting us on this bill. Rick DeBobes leads our \nminority staff of seventeen. Though small in numbers, they all make \nhuge contributions to the work of the committee each and every day. Mr. \nPresident, as a tribute to their professionalism and with my thanks, I \nrecognize Chris Cowart, Dan Cox, Madelyn Creedon, Mitch Crosswait, Rick \nDeBodes, Brie Eisen, Evelyn Farkas, Richard Fieldhouse, Creighton \nGreene, Jeremy Hekhuis, Bridget Higgins, Maren Leed, Gary Leeling, \nPeter Levine, Mike McCord, Bill Monahan, and Arun Seraphin.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the names \nof staff printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Committee on Armed Services\n\n       Judith A.

The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I think the most recent tribute by each of the managers \nto each other is yet another illustration of the kind of bipartisanship \nthat is so routinely achieved in the Armed Services Committee. Thanks \nfor the extraordinary leadership and effort of\n\n[[Page S7301]]\n\nthese two genuine patriots. I admire the work they do. They set a \nstandard for the rest of us. I admire, especially, the manner with \nwhich they have managed this legislation. This has been one of the \ntoughest jobs we have had in a long time. They have done it admirably. \nWe owe them a debt of gratitude, not only for the work done but for the \nmanner with which they have done it. I congratulate them both.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the distinguished minority leader very much for \nhis words.\n  Mr. FRIST. I, too, congratulate both of the managers. It has been a \nlong month. It has been 16 days, but since March 17 we actually started \nthe bill. There was a lot in the background people did not see in terms \nof progress being made, setbacks along the way and negotiations and \ndiscussions, both inside each caucus as well as debate on the floor. It \nis a real privilege to be the leader of both managers and of both \ncaucuses, working together to produce a bill that a few minutes ago we \npassed, a bill we can all be very proud of. I appreciate everyone's \ncooperation, participation, diligence, and focus throughout.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank our distinguished majority leader, truly a very \ngracious soul and of pure heart.\n  Mr. FRIST. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Local Law Enforcement \nEnhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. By passing this \nlegislation and changing current law, we can change hearts and minds as \nwell.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/23/senate-section/article/S7301-4", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7301]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               HONORING USCG COMMANDER TIMOTHY ALAN COOK\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Commander Timothy \nAlan Cook for his service to the United States Senate and his continued \nservice to our country in the United States Coast Guard.\n  Commander Cook has been detailed to be the Coast Guard Liaison to the \nUnited States Senate since July 2001, and I am proud to have had the \nopportunity to work closely with him over the past 3 years. In my \nleadership roles on the Transportation and Homeland Security \nAppropriations Subcommittees, my staff and I have often relied on \nCommander Cook's tremendous grasp on the inner-workings of both the \nCoast Guard and the Senate.\n  Commander Cook began his Senate career in 1997 as the Coast Guard \nFellow to the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, Oceans \nand Fisheries Subcommittee. However, his Coast Guard career began more \nthan a decade earlier as a 1986 graduate of the U.S. Coast Guard \nAcademy.\n  Then-Ensign Cook's first tour was as Deck Watch Officer aboard the \nMedium Endurance Cutter DAUNTLESS (WMEC 624) then stationed in Miami \nBeach, FL. In 1988 he became Executive Officer of the Fast Patrol Boat \nMANITOU (WPB 1302) also stationed in Miami Beach, FL.\n  He was selected for the Coast Guard Academy Postgraduate Instructor \nProgram in 1990 and attended Duke University where he received his \nMaster of Arts degree in Public Policy. CDR Cook taught U.S. History \nand American Government in the Coast Guard Academy Humanities \nDepartment from 1992 to 1995. During this period he also qualified as \nDeck Watch Officer on the Coast Guard Tall Ship EAGLE (WIX 327).\n  In 1995 he assumed Command of the Fast Patrol Boat MAUI (WPB 1304) \nstationed in Miami Beach, FL. During this time he also completed a \nMaster of Arts degree in Political Science from Brown University.\n  Then, following his service at the Senate Commerce Committee, \nCommander Cook became Executive Officer of the Medium Endurance Cutter \nBEAR (WMEC 901) at the mid-point of its 106-day Mediterranean cruise. \nDuring his tour he completed numerous patrols in the Caribbean \nconducting the Coast Guard law enforcement and search and rescue \nmissions.\n  This week, Commander Cook will leave his post as the Coast Guard's \nSenate Liaison. He will be missed in the United States Senate, but the \nCoast Guard needs his expertise on the Deepwater Acquisition Program.\n  It has been my pleasure to work with Commander Cook. On behalf of the \nSenators and staff who have also been fortunate to work with him, I \nwish Commander Cook, his wife Nancy and their two sons, Evan and Joel, \nthe best in all of their future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/23/senate-section/article/S7301-5", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7301]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RHODE ISLAND VETERANS POST OFFICE BUILDING\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate passed \nlegislation, H.R. 3942, earlier this month to redesignate the U.S. Post \nOffice in Middletown the ``Rhode Island Veterans Post Office \nBuilding,'' and I thank Congressman Patrick Kennedy for introducing \nthis important legislation in the House of Representatives. I recognize \nthe important contributions and sacrifices that our military veterans \nhave made for our country. The celebration of the 60th anniversary of \nthe D-Day invasion at Normandy this month again highlighted the great \nsacrifices that our brave soldiers have made, and continue to make \ntoday in Afghanistan, Iraq and throughout the world. I am proud to \nsupport naming the U.S. Post Office in Middletown in their honor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/23/senate-section/article/S7301-6", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7301-S7302]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS SAFETY ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to note the House passage \ntoday of the Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act, H.R. 218, by voice \nvote. This action has been a long time in coming. Representative Randy \n``Duke'' Cunningham has been tirelessly working for over a decade to \npush this legislation and I commend him for his dedication to making \nour communities safer and providing better protection for our law \nenforcement personnel. I ask that the Senate follow suit and quickly \ntake up and pass the House bill.\n  Law enforcement officers are never ``off duty.'' They are dedicated \npublic servants trained to uphold the law and keep the peace. To enable \nlaw enforcement officers nationwide to be prepared to answer a call to \nduty no matter where, when or in what form it comes, I am proud to join \nSenator Campbell--my good friend and a knowledgeable Senate leader on \nlaw enforcement issues--and 69 other cosponsors, including Judiciary \nChairman Hatch, Democratic Leader Daschle, Assistant Democratic Leader \nReid, Majority Leader Frist and Assistant Majority Leader McConnell, on \nthe Senate version of the Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act, S. 253,\n\n[[Page S7302]]\n\nwhich was reported out of the Senate Judiciary Committee in March 2003 \nby a vote of 18 to 1. Both H.R. 218 and S. 253 will permit off-duty and \nretired law enforcement officers to carry a firearm and be prepared to \nassist in dangerous situations.\n  These bills are strongly supported by the Fraternal Order of Police, \nFOP; the National Association of Police Organizations, NAPO; the \nFederal Law Enforcement Officers Association, FLEOA; the International \nBrotherhood of Police Officers, IBPO; the Law Enforcement Alliance of \nAmerica; and the National Law Enforcement Council.\n  I was honored to work closely on this measure with the former FOP \nnational president, Lieutenant Steve Young, whose death last year was a \nsad loss for us all. Steve was dedicated to this legislation because he \nunderstood the importance of having law enforcement officers across the \nNation armed and prepared whenever and wherever threats to our public \nsafety arise. I have continued my close work with the FOP and current \nnational president, Major Chuck Canterbury, to make this legislation \nlaw.\n  Community policing and the outstanding work of so many law \nenforcement officers play a vital role in our crime control efforts. \nUnfortunately, during the past few years the downward trend in violent \ncrime ended and violent crime rates have turned upward. The FBI has \nreported that crime rose slightly in the first half of 2002, including \na 2.3 percent increase in murders. The preliminary numbers for 2002 \nfollow an increase in crime in 2001 by 2.1 percent, compared with the \nyear before.\n  There are more than 740,000 sworn law enforcement officers currently \nserving in the United States. Since the first recorded police death in \n1792, there have been more than 17,200 law enforcement officers killed \nin the line of duty. Over 1,700 law enforcement officers died in the \nline of duty over the last decade, an average of 170 deaths per year. \nRoughly 5 percent of officers who die are killed while taking law \nenforcement action in an off-duty capacity. On average, more than \n62,000 law enforcement officers are assaulted annually.\n  The Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act creates a mechanism by which \nqualified active-duty law enforcement officers would be permitted to \ntravel interstate with a firearm, subject to certain limitations, \nprovided that officers are carrying their official badges and \nphotographic identification. An active-duty officer may carry a \nconcealed firearm under this measure if he or she is authorized to \nengage in or supervise any violation of law; is authorized to use a \nfirearm by the agency, meets agency standards to regularly use a \nfirearm; and is not prohibited from carrying by Federal, State or local \nlaw. This measure would not interfere with any officer's right to carry \na concealed firearm on private or government property while on duty or \non official business.\n  Off-duty and retired officers should also be permitted to carry their \nfirearms across State and other jurisdictional lines, at no cost to \ntaxpayers, in order to better serve and protect our communities. H.R. \n218 would permit qualified law enforcement officers and qualified \nretired law enforcement officers across the Nation to carry concealed \nfirearms in most situations. It preserves any State law that restricts \nconcealed firearms on private property and any State law that restricts \nthe possession of a firearm on State or local government property.\n  To qualify for the measure's exemptions to permit a qualified off-\nduty law enforcement officer to carry a concealed firearm, \nnotwithstanding the law of the State or political subdivision of the \nState, he or she must have authority to use a firearm by the law \nenforcement agency where he or she works; not be subject to any \ndisciplinary action; satisfy every standard of the agency to regularly \nuse a firearm; not be prohibited by Federal law from receiving a \nfirearm; and carry a photo identification issued by the agency. The \nbill preserves any State law that restricts concealed firearms on \nprivate property, and any State law that restricts the possession of a \nfirearm on State or local government property or park.\n  For a retired law enforcement officer to qualify for exemption from \nState laws prohibiting the carrying of concealed firearms, he or she \nmust have retired in good standing; have been qualified by the agency \nto carry or use a firearm; have been employed at least 15 years as a \nlaw enforcement officer unless forced to retire due to a service-\nconnected disability; have a non-forfeitable right to retirement plan \nbenefits of the law enforcement agency; meet the same State firearms \ntraining and qualifications as an active officer; not be prohibited by \nFederal law from receiving a firearm; and be carrying a photo \nidentification issued by the agency. Preserved would be any State law \nthat permits restrictions of concealed firearms on private property, as \nwell as any State law that restricts the possession of a firearm on \nState or local government property or park.\n  Last week, during the House Judiciary Committee markup of H.R. 218, \namendments were accepted to bar officers or retired police from \ncarrying arms in other jurisdictions if they are under the influence of \nalcohol or other intoxicating or hallucinatory drug or substance, and \nto require retired police to have proof they received arms training in \nthe previous year before being permitted to carry concealed weapons. \nThe bill was then reported out of committee by a vote of 23 to 9. The \nbill was passed overwhelmingly by the House earlier today by voice \nvote.\n  Convicted criminals often have long and exacting memories. A law \nenforcement officer is a target in uniform and out, active or retired, \non duty or off duty. The bipartisan Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act \nis designed to establish national measures of uniformity and \nconsistency to permit trained and certified on-duty, off-duty, or \nretired law enforcement officers to carry concealed firearms in most \nsituations so that they may respond immediately to crimes across State \nand other jurisdictional lines, as well as to protect themselves and \ntheir families from vindictive criminals.\n  I look forward to the Senate approving this bipartisan, commonsense \nmeasure today to make our communities safer and to better protect law \nenforcement officers and their families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/23/senate-section/article/S7302-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7302-S7303]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               EXEMPTION FROM TRUST REFORM REORGANIZATION\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 2523, a \nbill to exempt the Great Plains Region and Rocky Mountain Region of the \nBureau of Indian Affairs, BIA, from trust reform reorganization plans. \nI am happy to be an original cosponsor of this bill with my friend and \ncolleague Senator Tom Daschle.\n  S. 2523 would exempt the BIA's Great Plains Region and the Rocky \nMountain Region from the Department of the Interior's trust reform \nreorganization proposal, excluding efforts to reform Indian probate and \naddress land consolidation, pending the submission of alternative \nagency-specific reorganization plans. The bill would direct that any \nfunds appropriated to accomplish trust reform at the agency level in \nthe Great Plains and Rocky Mountains Regions could be expended only \nunder plans developed by local tribes in cooperation with and with the \napproval of the Department of the Interior. The bill authorizes \n$200,000 for the Great Plains Region and $200,000 for the Rocky \nMountain Region to be used for the development of agency-specific \nreorganization plans.\n  The bill is an alternative to the Department of the Interior's ``To-\nBe'' trust reorganization plan. The BIA and the Office of Special \nTrustee, OSI, is in a state of ongoing reengineering of their trust \nmanagement processes since the Department issued a new Department \nManual in April, 2003. Since November, 2003, the Department has \nconducted informational meeting regarding its ``To-Be'' project, which \nwould reengineer current fiduciary trust business process. This ``To-\nBe'' plan is unacceptable to our tribes. Simply, the administration's \nproposed changes to the way tribes receive trust services do not fit \nthe needs of our area.\n  Specifically, our tribes require frequent land appraisals due to our \nlarge land base. Currently there is only one appraiser for the entire \nGreat Plains Region. Under a proposed plan, money that would be spent \nhiring ``trust officers'' would be utilized by hiring appraisers at \neach agency on each reservation. Furthermore, as a region we\n\n[[Page S7303]]\n\nare in need of technical positions involving land management, such as \nsurveyors, range conservationists, lease compliance officers, rights of \nway specialists, and accountants. In sum, the tribes request a reversal \nof the reorganization process and that resources be redirected as to be \nmore effectively used at the reservation level under control of the \nlocal agent.\n  The concepts in S. 2523 are particularly poignant in light of serious \nquestions that have been raised regarding failures in the OST's entire \nmanagement and administrative system. As a result of these questions, I \nhave requested a wide-ranging investigation of the OST. This \ninvestigation centers on a number of concerns tribal leaders have \nraised in recent years as OST has expanded its mission from one \ndesigned to oversee trust reform efforts at the Interior Department to \none implementing most major fixes. Under the Bush administration, the \nagency's budget has dramatically increased while funds for other Indian \nprograms are being cut or flat-lined.\n  In addition to questioning funding considerations, I question whether \nthe OST is operating in a manner consistent with the 1994 Act that \ncreated it. During the Bush administration, the agency has seen \nunprecedented growth and has slowly taken over programs formerly \nmanaged by BIA, including cash management, appraisals, probate and \naccounting. Tribal leaders and some lawmakers say this expansion \nviolates the intent of Congress in creating the office.\n\n  I am honored to represent a State that has nine treaty tribes. \nFederally-recognized Indian tribes in South Dakota signed the Treaty of \nFort Laramie with the desire to declare peace and thereby perpetuate a \nnation-to-nation relationship with the Federal Government. The treaty \nestablishing the South Dakota Tribes is a contract negotiated between \nsovereign nations, relating to peace and alliance formally acknowledged \nby the signatories of the nations. The United States entered into such \nagreement because they desired peace and cessions of land from the \nSioux Tribes, and in return they made promises that must be upheld.\n  It is important to point out that my treaty tribes opt to receive \ntheir services directly from the BIA. As such, it is essential to my \ntribes that they have a clear understanding of what their Bureau is up \nto and how its actions will affect the services received by my tribes. \nIn South Dakota, the BIA affects our Indian people every single day. \nTheir partnership with the Federal Government is paramount to their \nsurvival as nations and is vital to the health of its people. With this \npremise in mind, I implore the Department to do a better job of \nconsulting with tribes, appropriately fund BIA programs, and have an \nopen and frequent dialogue with Congress. As a member of both the \nAppropriations and Indian Affairs Committee, I must be made aware of \nthe Bureau and the Office of Special Trustee's programming plans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/23/senate-section/article/S7303-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7303]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           S.J. RESOLUTION 37\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S.J. \nResolution 37, a resolution to acknowledge a long history of official \ndepredations and ill-conceived policies by the United States Government \nregarding Indian tribes and offer an apology to all native peoples on \nbehalf of the United States.\n  A formal apology is the first appropriate step in reconciling \nrelationships with Indian tribes and native peoples. However, an \napology by itself is not enough to heal the wounds inflicted by some of \nthe devastating policies adopted by our government. To really make \namends with Indian tribes and native peoples, our government needs to \nreturn to the original understanding of the Federal-tribal \nrelationship. The foundation of the Federal-tribal relationship is \nrooted in our great Constitution and the Indian treaties ratified \npursuant to it. When a person reads the Founder's words pertaining to \nthe sovereignty of Indian tribes, in conjunction with the early laws \nand treaties ratified by our government, he or she quickly realizes \nthat the underpinnings of the Federal-tribal relationship is based upon \nmutual respect, trust responsibility, and the idea that our government \nmust obtain consent from Indian tribes and native peoples before any \nFederal action can be taken.\n  Almost every Indian treaty recognizes that Indian tribes have control \nover their lands and that our government could not assert authority or \ntake lands away from tribes unless there is an articulation of tribal \nconsent. The first treaty our government signed with an Indian Nation \nwas the 1778 Treaty of Fort Pitt. During the American Revolutionary \nWar, our government signed this treaty to obtain permission from the \nDelaware Nation to allow General Washington's army to cross through \ntheir territory. If the Delaware Nation would not have permitted this \ncrossing, the history of our United States might have turned out \ndrastically differently.\n  As history teaches, when our government swayed away from the \nfoundation of the Federal-tribal relationship, Indian tribes and native \npeoples suffered. For example, in 1830, Congress narrowly passed the \nRemoval Act to remove all Native Americans west of the Mississippi \nRiver. However, the text and legislative history of the Removal Act \nclearly demonstrates that removal would not occur unless there was \ntribal consent. Because many Cherokee did not consent to being removed, \nin 1838, our government forced their removal, thus resulting in the \nTrail of Tears tragedy.\n  Chairman J.C. Crawford of the Sisseton-Wahpeton Tribe wrote to remind \nme that in 1862 nearly 400 Dakota Indians were tried by a military \ncourt without legal representation following a conflict arising out of \nour government not adhering to its treaty obligations. Eventually, on \nDecember 26, 1862, 38 Dakota men were hanged. To date, this has been \nthe largest mass execution in American history.\n\n  Our government violated the 1868 Fort Laramie Treaty. Under the Fort \nLaramie Treaty, our government agreed that if any land is to be taken \nfrom the Lakota Nation, three-fourths of all adult males must agree to \nany cession. Because our government failed to obtain Lakota consent, \nthree prominent historical tragedies occurred, the Battle of Little Big \nHorn, the Wounded Knee Massacre, and the taking of the Black Hills.\n  Additionally, in the late 1800s, our government violated numerous \ntreaties and embarked upon a harsh assimilationist policy that ignored \nthe foundations of the Federal-tribal relationship. For example, in \n1887 our government enacted the General Allotment Act. Under the \nGeneral Allotment Act, tribal lands were broken up, thus reducing \ntribal lands from 138 million acres in 1887 to 48 million acres in \n1934. Although our government ended the harsh policies contained in the \nGeneral Allotment by enacting the 1934 Indian Reorganization Act, by \nthe 1950s our government quickly reversed course and implemented \nlegislation that terminated the Federal-tribal relationship with some \nIndian tribes. Although many Indian tribes have been successful with \nregaining federal recognition status, some have not been as successful.\n  Currently, our government is committed to tribal self-determination \nand empowering tribal governments. However, to make this apology \ncomplete and to demonstrate that our government is sincere in \napologizing to Indian tribes and native peoples, our government needs \nto allocate more resources to Indian tribes and native peoples and \nfulfill its trust obligation found in treaties and concurrent \nlegislation.\n  Our government has adopted numerous laws and policies that undermined \nand adversely impacted the Federal-tribal relationship. For those \nreasons, I strongly support the apology articulated in S.J. Resolution \n37. I urge my colleagues to similarly support this resolution and \nreflect on the meaning of the Federal-tribal relationship.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/23/senate-section/article/S7303-2", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7303-S7304]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n             HONORING THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF ALLISON HAMMER\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

Mr. President, I wish to honor Miss Ekaterina \nMikhailovich Radzhabova who graduated this month with a master's degree \nin business from Xavier University in Cincinnati, OH. Miss Radzhabova \nis a Russian immigrant who came to the United States 5 years ago, at \nthe age of 19, to seek an education and a better way of life.\n  Since coming to America, Miss Radzhabova has completed both her \nundergraduate and graduate programs at Xavier with the highest possible \nhonors. This is particularly impressive considering that she \naccomplished this while speaking her second language, English.\n  Miss Radzhabova has not only proven herself dedicated through her \nhard work at school, but also through the volunteer work that she has \nperformed in her extra time to help inner city children develop better \nskills in reading and arithmetic. On the weekends, she drives outside \nthe city to help an elderly family with chores that they can no longer \ndo on their own. Indeed, through her hard work and service, she has \nclearly demonstrated the American ideal of helping those who are less \nfortunate. Miss Radzhabova is not only an inspiration to the youth of \nRussia but also to all of our young Americans.\n  During her graduation ceremony this month, Ekaterina Radzhabova was \nsurrounded by many of the friends that she made while living in the \nUnited States. Unfortunately, her family was unable to attend the \nceremonies. One of those family members was her father, Mikhail \nRadzhabova, who passed away in October 2001. It was his dream to have \nhis family come to the United States after the fall of the Soviet \nUnion. Although her father was not able to attend the ceremony in \nperson, I am sure that he was there in spirit, looking proudly upon his \ndaughter, knowing that she had helped make his dream a reality. \nUnfortunately, her mother and brother were denied visas to attend her \ngraduation. But, like her father, they are undoubtedly proud of her \naccomplishments.\n  Miss Radzhabova is a talented young woman who has overcome a great \ndeal since she came to America to pursue her dream. She has proven to \nbe a great success in her new country by not only accomplishing part of \nher father's dream, but also by inspiring countless people around her \nwith her positive attitude and determination to succeed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/23/senate-section/article/S7304-4", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7304]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  EAST BRUNSWICK HIGH SCHOOL PLACING FIRST AT THE WE THE PEOPLE: THE \n                  CITIZEN AND THE CONSTITUTION PROGRAM\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG.

He received undergraduate and graduate degrees from the \nUniversity of New Orleans, and his work with NMCI still brings him back \nto the UNO campus. Though he is now stationed in Virginia, his heart \nand family remain in New Orleans. As a Louisiana Senator, I like that.\n  Captain Christopher's work at NMCI has been truly outstanding. The \nNavy Marine Corps Intranet is a progressive project whose ultimate goal \nis to transform the Department of the Navy's computer networks. NMCI \nwill revolutionize command and control efficiencies within the Navy, \nand between the services, to ensure that our forces are operating in \nunison. This will save American lives, increase combat readiness and \neffectiveness, and, ultimately, make us stronger. Under Captain \nChristopher's leadership, many of these goals have been brought closer \nto reality.\n  From June 20 to 23, Captain Christopher organized the 2004 Navy \nMarine Corps Intranet Symposium in New Orleans.

Mr. President, today I wish to honor the \nConnecticut Forest and Park Association of Rockfall, CT, on the \noccasion of the 75th Anniversary of the creation of its Blue Blazed \nHiking Trail System. The Connecticut Forest and Park Association is \nConnecticut's oldest conservation organization and Connecticut's \ncitizens owe this organization a great debt of gratitude for all it has \ndone to protect Connecticut's precious natural resources.\n  Undoubtedly, the Blue Blazed Hiking Trail System is the crowning \nachievement in a long list of accomplishments that the Connecticut \nForest and Park Association has realized since its founding in 1895. IN \n1929, Edgar L. Heermance led a group of Connecticut Forest and Park \nAssociation members in establishing the Blue Blazed Hiking Trail \nSystem. Mr. Heermance and the dedicated group of volunteers that he led \nhad a vision of a Statewide system of hiking trails that would serve to \nincrease opportunities for all Connecticut residents to enjoy the \noutdoors and develop an appreciation for the immense beauty of the \nnatural world. The first section of the Blue Blazed Hiking Trail system \nopened in 1931 and by 1937 the volunteers of the Connecticut Forest and \nPark Association had developed over four hundred miles of trails and \npublished the Connecticut Walk Book; the first guidebook to the Blue \nBlazed Hiking Trail System.\n  Seventy-five years after Edgar Heermance made his vision of a \nStatewide hiking trail system a reality, the blue Blazed Hiking Trail \nSystem has over ninety volunteer Trail Managers and hundreds of active \nvolunteers donating over 7,000 of their time each year to this \nspectacular system of hiking trails. Currently, the Blue Blazed Hiking \nTrail System encompasses over seven hundred miles of trails in 69 \nConnecticut towns. In a true testament to the spirit of cooperation \nthat led to the founding of this hiking trail network, over seventy-\nfive percent of the land included in the Blue Blazed Hiking Trail \nSystem is privately owned and exists only through the cooperation of \nprivate landowners who are interested in promoting conservation and \nincreasing outdoor recreational opportunities.\n  This dynamic organization has continually both literally and \nfiguratively blazed a trail for other conservation organizations to \nfollow. I have confidence that the Connecticut Forest and Park \nAssociation and the Blue Blazed Hiking Trail System will enjoy \ncontinued success for many generations to come.\n  Congratulations to the Connecticut Forest and Park Association on the \ncreation of a remarkable legacy of leadership and excellence in the \nareas of conservation and outdoor recreation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/23/senate-section/article/S7305-4", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7305-S7306]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         RETIREMENT OF MAJOR GENERAL JOHN ``GENE'' PRENDERGAST\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today I honor and congratulate my \nfriend MG Prendergast.\n  After 46 years of loyal military service to Montana and our Nation, \nthe top officer of the Montana National Guard will step down from his \npost August 1, as age prevents Major General Prendergast from serving \nbeyond his 64th birthday.\n  Some call him general, some call him husband, father, son. I call \nthis outstanding individual, my friend. I have known Gene since the \nearly years in our hometown of Helena, MT, where we both lived and \nplayed, studied and worked. In 1958, when Dwight Eisenhouser was \nPresident, Major General Prendergast volunteered for his first of many \nmilitary positions in the Montana Air National Guard while also working \na civilian job at a local bank. I worked with him at the Union Bank \nduring the summer months away from school. In 1960, he transferred into \nthe Montana National Guard and received his commission in 1967 as an \nordnance officer.\n  Major General Prendergast worked his way up through the ranks, and \nheld various titles, including automotive platoon leader, instructor at \nthe Montana Military Academy, assistant commandant and chief of staff \nof the Montana National Guard. He graduated from the Regents College of \nthe State University of New York in 1993.\n  For his outstanding service and many years of commitment to our \nNation, Major General Prendergast has been awarded the Meritorious \nService Medal with two oak leaf clusters, Army Commendation Medal, \nArmed Forces Reserve Medal, and the Army Reserve Components Overseas \nTraining Ribbon, among other medals.\n  Major General Prendergast is known among his colleagues, his friends, \nand all Montanans for his commitment to the American Nation. In his own \nwords, ``There is no higher calling than serving your country in \nuniform. What it's all about is the soldier in uniform.''\n  Today I honor both the soldier and the man. I have been so fortunate \nto have this man as my friend over many years. In fact, my good friend \nshares with me a love for long-distance running, and I have enjoyed \nrunning many\n\n[[Page S7306]]\n\nmiles with the general under Montana's big sky. We run and talk, laugh \nand share family stories.\n  As I reflect on the years I have been fortunate to know MG Gene \nPrendergast, I am reminded of the plaque which hangs in his office that \nhis wife, Kathy, had made for him, the long-distance runner:\n\n       ``The race is not always to the swift, but those who keep \n     on running.'' Around the world in 22 years--running 25,000 \n     miles--June 1978-August 2000.\n\n  For my friend, MG Gene Prendergast, the race has only just begun. You \nare a soldier's soldier. I salute you for your outstanding service to \nour State and to this Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/23/senate-section/article/S7306-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7306]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:22 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 4613.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Louisiana relative to the \n     establishment of the Coastal Forest Reserve Program; to the \n     Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 75\n\n       Whereas, Louisiana's coastal land loss problem is well \n     known within the state and is gaining recognition across the \n     country as one of the nation's most pressing conservation \n     issues; and\n       Whereas, of recent concern in the state is the conservation \n     and management of privately-owned coastal forests due to \n     their importance in stabilizing soils and providing \n     structural barriers against coastal erosion, in addition to \n     their particular importance to neotropical migratory song \n     birds and colonial wading birds; and\n       Whereas, the United States Congress has responded to the \n     need to conserve and restore wildlife habitat throughout the \n     nation by authorizing and funding numerous conservation \n     incentive programs such as the Conservation and Wetlands \n     Reserve Programs (CRP/WRP); and\n       Whereas, Conservation and Wetlands Reserve Programs are \n     authorized to apply to agricultural lands and therefore are \n     not available to provide incentives to coastal forest owners \n     to preserve their forests or manage them sustainably; and\n       Whereas, considering the dramatic loss of coastal forests \n     to saltwater intrusion and the importance of coastal forests, \n     and individual trees, to the structural integrity of \n     Louisiana's coastal wetlands, now popularized as ``America's \n     WETLAND,'' it is ironic that an incentive program is not \n     available to secure the conservation of this critical \n     resource: Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana memorializes \n     the Congress of the United States to authorize and fund the \n     establishment of a Coastal Forest Reserve Program to provide \n     incentives to coastal forest owners to preserve and \n     sustainably manage their coastal forests as part of the state \n     and national initiative to restore the Mississippi River \n     coastal delta and chenier plain of southwest Louisiana; be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana urges and \n     requests the United States Department of Agriculture Forest \n     Service, the Louisiana Department of Agriculture and \n     Forestry, and the Louisiana State University School of \n     Renewable Natural Resources, with assistance from the \n     University of Louisiana at Lafayette and other Louisiana \n     universities, to provide an inventory of coastal forests and \n     assess their functional values for the purposes of \n     establishing eligibility and priority ranking for enrollment \n     in a Coastal Forest Reserve Program; be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution shall be \n     transmitted to the secretary of the United States Senate and \n     the clerk of the United States House of Representatives, and \n     to each member of the Louisiana delegation to the United \n     States Congress; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution shall be \n     transmitted to the chief of the United States Department of \n     Agriculture Forest Service, the commissioner of the Louisiana \n     Department of Agriculture and Forestry, the director of the \n     Louisiana State University School of Renewable Natural \n     Resources, and the president of the University of Louisiana \n     at Lafayette.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-453. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Hawaii relative to the Marine \n     Corps Training Area in Waikane Valley, Hawaii; to the \n     Committee on Armed Services.\n       Whereas, Waikane Valley contains undeveloped land in the \n     ahupuaa of Waikane on Oahu's windward side; and\n       Whereas, 33 years ago, the United States Marine Corps \n     obtained 187 acres in Waikane Valley, commonly referred to as \n     the ``Waikane Training Area,'' for military jungle and live \n     ordnance training; and\n       Whereas, the United States Marine Corps has announced its \n     intention to close the Waikane Training Area, but as recently \n     as last year, the United States Marine Corps has sought to \n     use Waikane Valley for more military jungle training; and\n       Whereas, ironically, Waikane Valley was abandoned as a \n     training site by the United States Marine Corps because of \n     safety concerns over the use of high explosive anti-tank and \n     bazooka rounds used in the past and the insufficient data to \n     determine the exact number of ammunition rounds fired in the \n     valley; and\n       Whereas, the United States Marine Corps originally obtained \n     the right to use the Waikane Training Area by a lease from \n     the McCandless Estate and Waiahole Water Company in 1953 and \n     subsequently by a lease from the same parties and the heirs \n     of John Kamaka; and\n       Whereas, the Kamaka heirs acquired title to the Waikane \n     Training Area by quitclaim deed in June of 1972 and \n     terminated the lease with the United States Marine Corps in \n     1976; and\n       Whereas, between 1976 and 1993, the United States Marine \n     Corps conducted several investigations and ordnance removal \n     efforts on the property and concluded that the Waikane \n     Training Area could never be certified as being clear of \n     ordnance; and\n       Whereas, the United States Navy and Marine Corps acquired \n     title to the Waikane Training Area in 1993 by condemnation as \n     a means to address the problem of not being able to fulfill \n     their lease obligations to return the property to the Kamaka \n     heirs in an ordnance-free and safe condition; and\n       Whereas, land in Hawaii, and particularly agricultural and \n     conservation land, is Hawaii's most precious and limited \n     resource; and\n       Whereas, Waikane Valley has served historically as \n     important agricultural area for the island of Oahu and \n     contains precious archaeological and historic sites; and\n       Whereas, regardless of the 1993 condemnation, members of \n     the Waikane community believe that the United States Marine \n     Corps should live up to their commitment of cleaning up the \n     land, and they have expressed their desire to have the \n     Waikane Training Area restored to a condition that will \n     permit them to return to the aina and engage in farming and \n     other agricultural activities that would be appropriate based \n     on the condition of the remediated property; and\n       Whereas, the federal government and military have \n     previously demonstrated their will and capacity to honor \n     their obligations to remediate and restore other equally or \n     more severely contaminated installations upon closure under \n     the Formerly Used Defense Site Program, Defense Environmental \n     Restoration Program, Installation Restoration Program, other \n     Department of Defense initiatives and programs, and with \n     special appropriations from Congress; and\n       Whereas, the current official position of United States \n     Department of Defense is that no ordnance-contaminated site \n     can ever be certified as being clear of unexploded ordnance; \n     and\n       Whereas, based on the inability to certify the Waikane \n     Training Area as being clear of unexploded ordnance, the \n     United States Navy and Marine Corps are considering permanent \n     closure of the property to the general public by erecting a \n     security fence around the area; and\n       Whereas, the permanent closure of the Waikane Training Area \n     would be a devastating loss of precious agricultural, \n     historical, cultural, and natural resources to Hawaii; and\n       Whereas, with sufficient funding from existing restoration \n     programs or special appropriations from Congress, or both, \n     the United States Navy and Marine Corps have the means to \n     clean-up the Waikane Training Area to a condition that is \n     reasonably safe for certain restricted uses, provided long-\n     term monitoring and guidelines are established: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the Twenty-Second Legislature of \n     the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2004, That the \n     federal government is requested to conduct a thorough \n     evaluation of the condition of the Waikane Training Area, \n     particularly with regard to environmental and ordnance-\n     related hazards that exist on the property; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the federal government is requested to plan \n     for and conduct as thorough a clean-up of the Waikane \n     Training Area as is technologically possible, including the \n     remediation or removal of all environmental hazards and \n     contamination and removal of all practice and live ordnance; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That the federal government is requested to \n     conduct a post-clean-up environmental assessment of the \n     Waikane Training Area evaluating the potential risks to human \n     health and safety, for the purpose of determining the types \n     of uses and activities that could appropriately be conducted \n     on the property with minimal risk to potential users and the \n     community at large; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the federal government is requested to \n     return the Waikane Training Area to the State of Hawaii upon \n     completion of the clean-up; and be it further\n       Resolved, that the federal government is requested to \n     appropriate sufficient funds to plan for, implement, and \n     complete the rehabilitation and transfer of the Waikane \n     Training Area; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the members of Hawaii's congressional \n     delegation are requested to assist in seeking and obtaining \n     the relief sought above; and be it further\n       Resolved, That certified copies of this Resolution be \n     transmitted to President of the United States, President of \n     the United States Senate, Speaker of the United States House \n     of Representatives, members of Hawaii's congressional \n     delegation, the Commandant of the Marine Corps, and the \n     Secretary of the Navy.\n\n[[Page S7309]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n       POM-454. A joint resolution adopted by the General Assembly \n     of the State of Tennessee relative to United States \n     government uniforms and equipment; to the Committee on Armed \n     Services.\n\n                     Senate Joint Resolution No. 64\n\n       Whereas, it is with great pride and honor that the \n     hardworking employees of American factories craft the \n     uniforms and equipment that clothe and protect the members of \n     the United States government; and\n       Whereas, to take that privilege away from those Americans \n     who ceaselessly toil to fulfill their patriotic duty to the \n     men and women who serve our fine country is a grievous insult \n     to the American people; and\n       Whereas, on October 28, 2002, Fechheimer Brothers \n     Manufacturing Company in Martin learned that one of its \n     largest accounts, the United States Postal Service, had \n     certified a new supplier of postal uniforms, San Francisco \n     Knitting Mills--one that cuts costs by manufacturing the \n     product outside the United States; and\n       Whereas, according to a memo from Fechheimer President and \n     CEO, Brad Kinstler, San Francisco Knitting Mills is ``the \n     first manufacturer to venture outside of the U.S. to make \n     products for the postal market,'' an action which may result \n     in setting a dangerous precedent; and\n       Whereas, the Fechheimer-Martin plant, formerly Martin \n     Manufacturing Company, is one of four plants owned by the \n     Fechheimer Corporation of Cincinnati; and\n       Whereas, three of the plants: Martin, Tennessee; Jefferson, \n     Pennsylvania; and Grantsville, Maryland; manufacture uniform \n     shirts. The corporation's plant in Hodgenville, Kentucky \n     manufactures uniform trousers; and\n       Whereas, twenty percent of the Fechheimer Brothers \n     Manufacturing Company's annual production consists of the \n     postal service's purchases; the loss of the contract with the \n     postal service could result in massive layoffs at the plant, \n     possibly up to twenty percent of the company's 200 workers, \n     which would then put a crimp in the local economy; and\n       Whereas, plant manager Marc Lemacks describes Fechheimer \n     Brothers Manufacturing Company as the ``Cadillac of the \n     industry,'' a corporation that consistently provides its \n     clients and customers with quality products and service; and\n       Whereas, Mr. Lemacks is aware of no complaints from the \n     United States Postal Service in regards to the uniforms \n     produced by his company; instead, he fears the postal \n     service's decision to change suppliers is based on an attempt \n     to secure a lower price with an offshore company; and\n       Whereas, not only will transferring production of postal \n     service uniforms to another country rob the American people \n     of their jobs and livelihoods, but it will result in a \n     decrease in revenue to the American government through the \n     loss of taxes paid by American workers; and\n       Whereas, it is crucial that the production of uniforms and \n     equipment for United States government workers remain in \n     American factories, for the producing and wearing of \n     American-made products strengthens the morale of both \n     government and civil service workers, boosts the country's \n     economy, and manifests the pride of the American government \n     toward its citizens: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the senate of the one hundred third General \n     Assembly of the State of Tennessee, the House of \n     Representatives concurring, That we respectfully urge the \n     Congress of the United States to resolve this important issue \n     and require that government uniforms and equipment be \n     manufactured in the United States, thus saving the jobs of \n     myriad Americans and strengthening the national economy; be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That appropriate copies of this resolution be \n     transmitted forthwith to the President of the United States, \n     the Speaker and the Clerk of the United States House of \n     Representatives, the President and the Secretary of the \n     United States Senate, and to each member of the Tennessee \n     Congressional Delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-455.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Senate of \n     the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania \n     relative to the Clean Water State Resolving Program; to the \n     Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 98\n\n       Whereas, the Congress of the United States established the \n     Clean Water State Revolving Fund to lend money to communities \n     to help pay for urgently needed wastewater infrastructure \n     projects; and\n       Whereas, the Clean Water State Revolving Fund has been one \n     of the most effective and practical ways to address the \n     United States' rapidly deteriorating water infrastructure \n     system; and\n       Whereas, in 1994, when authorization for the Clean Water \n     State Revolving Fund expired, the Congress continued to \n     approve money to capitalize the Clean Water State Revolving \n     Fund without authorization; and\n       Whereas, the United States Environmental Protection \n     Agency's 200 Clean Watersheds Needs Survey Report to Congress \n     documented five-year capital investment need for publicly \n     owned wastewater treatment facilities that are eligible for \n     funding under the Environmental Protection Agency's Clean \n     Water State Revolving Loan Fund Program and found national \n     needs of more than $181 billion; and\n       Whereas, that same study found the total needs across \n     Pennsylvania to be in excess of $8 billion, including $1 \n     billion for treatment facilities, $1.6 billion for new \n     collector and interceptor sewers and more than $4 billion for \n     the combined sewer overflow problem; and\n       Whereas, a 1999 Environmental Protection Agency Needs Gaps \n     Study found that sanitary sewer overflow needs in the 1996 \n     study were grossly underestimated, bringing the total \n     national wastewater infrastructure needs to more than $200 \n     billion; and\n        Whereas, independent studies indicate that when 20-year \n     replacement costs are added, the total wastewater \n     infrastructure needs will exceed $300 billion; and\n        Whereas, the performance of the Clean Water State \n     Revolving Fund has leveraged more than $21.2 billion in \n     capitalization grants into more than $38.7 billion in water \n     infrastructure projects; and\n        Whereas, up to 55,000 new jobs are created for every $1 \n     billion expended on water infrastructure; and\n        Whereas, the gap between funding and needs continues to \n     grow despite the significant amounts contributed to the Clean \n     Water State Revolving Fund in capitalization grants; and\n        Whereas, while the investor-owned utilities have had \n     access to the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DW-SRF) \n     since its inception, they have not had access to the Clean \n     Water State Revolving Fund; and\n        Whereas, the benefits of investor-owned utility access \n     would flow back to their customers, who are also taxpayers \n     contributing to the State revolving funds; and\n        Whereas, investor-owned utilities could use the Clean \n     Water State Revolving Fund to assist states with failing \n     systems, compliance problems or underserved areas, while \n     creating jobs and paying more taxes; Therefore be it\n        Resolved (the house of representatives concurring),That \n     the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania \n     acknowledge the key role of the Clean Water State Revolving \n     Fund Program in enhancing public health and safety, \n     protecting the environment and maintaining a strong economic \n     base by increasing labor productivity, creating jobs, \n     rehabilitating old neighborhoods and ensuring the \n     availability of recreational use of our waterways and \n     shorelines; and be it further\n        Resolved, That the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of \n     Pennsylvania recognize the Clean Water State Revolving Fund \n     Program as the most pragmatic and effective program that \n     provides states vital financial resources to address their \n     wastewater infrastructure needs; and be it further\n        Resolved, That the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of \n     Pennsylvania encourage all communities in the Commonwealth of \n     Pennsylvania to participate in this important program; and be \n     it further\n        Resolved, That the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of \n     Pennsylvania urge the Congress of the United States to expand \n     eligibility to the Clean Water State Revolving Fund so the \n     customers of investor-owned utilities can share in the \n     benefits of the Clean Water State Revolving Fund; and be it \n     further\n        Resolved, That the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of \n     Pennsylvania urge the Congress of the United States to \n     increase the annual Federal capitalization grant to the Clean \n     Water State Revolving Fund to better address the tremendous \n     needs across the United States and the Commonwealth of \n     Pennsylvania; and be it further\n        Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States, the presiding officers of \n     each house of Congress and to each member of Congress from \n     Pennsylvania.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-460. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Hawaii \n     relative to repealing the changes made to the Clean Air Act \n     in 2002; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 191\n\n       Whereas, according to the Clean Air Act, toxic substances \n     such as mercury must be controlled by the ``maximum \n     achievable control technology'' standard; and\n       Whereas, two years ago, the Environmental Protection Agency \n     estimated that under a maximum achievable control technology \n     standard, power plants using existing technologies could \n     reduce ninety per cent of mercury emissions from power \n     plants, bringing mercury emissions down from forty-eight tons \n     to roughly five tons per year by 2008; and\n       Whereas, under changes made by the Bush administration in \n     2002, there is allowed a significant delay for cleaning up \n     power plant mercury emissions and a standard that is far \n     weaker than the maximum achievable control technology \n     standard and is not protective of public health; and\n       Whereas, in effect, these changes would treat power plants' \n     mercury emissions as non-hazardous air pollution and allow \n     power plants to emit six to seven times more mercury into the \n     nation's air, and for a decade longer, than the Clean Air Act \n     requires; and\n       Whereas, additionally, changes made by the Bush \n     administration allow some plants to avoid reducing mercury \n     emissions altogether by purchasing pollution credits from \n     other cleaner plants, which increases the chances that toxic \n     ``hotspots'' could develop in communities where deposition is \n     more prevalent: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-\n     second Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of \n     2004, That the United States Congress is requested to repeal \n     the changes made by the Bush administration to the Clean Air \n     in 2002; and be it further\n       Resolved, That certified copies of this Resolution be \n     transmitted to the President of the United States Senate, the \n     Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, and \n     the members of Hawaii's congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-461.

Inconsistency \n     in the application of laws, including those assessing taxes, \n     is frustrating to individual citizens, business enterprises \n     of all types and sizes, and local and state governments; and\n       Whereas, an area of business activity where laws and taxes \n     are applied inconsistently is gaming. The sovereignty of \n     Native American tribes has resulted in a host of different \n     arrangements, even among tribal facilities. There is even \n     greater disparity between the operations of non-Native \n     American gaming facilities and Native American casinos; and\n       Whereas, while the states, including Michigan, have a very \n     limited capacity to rectify the differences in the treatment \n     of non-Native American and Native American gaming operations, \n     including taxation, the federal government could bring a \n     needed measure of fairness to this situation: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved by the house of representatives, That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to implement a \n     36 percent federal wagering tax on gross receipts at Native \n     American casinos and to redistribute the revenues to the \n     states of origin; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n\n[[Page S7311]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n       POM-462.

to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n                  House Concurrent Resolution No. 153\n\n       Whereas, the Millennium Young People's Congress held in \n     Hawaii in October 1999, demonstrated the value of a \n     collective global vision by and for the children of the world \n     as well as the need for a forum for international discussion \n     of issues facing all children and youth; and\n       Whereas, the World Youth Congress and representatives from \n     the Kingdom of Morocco met in Hawaii in March 2003, \n     demonstrating the collaboration that a Center for the \n     Advancement of Global Health, Welfare, Education, and Peace \n     By and For Children, Youth, and Families can promote; and\n       Whereas, world peace is a major collaborative goal, and \n     youth are key to attaining world peace, sustainability, and \n     productivity for future generations; and\n       Whereas, the health, welfare, and education of children and \n     families are part of the basic foundation of values shared \n     globally that should be provided for all children; and\n       Whereas, the populations of countries in Asia and the \n     Pacific Rim are the largest and fastest-growing segments of \n     the world's population, with young people representing the \n     largest percentage of those populations; and\n       Whereas, Hawaii's location at the center of the Pacific Rim \n     between Asia and the Americans, its diverse culture, and its \n     many shared languages provide an excellent strategic forum \n     for shared languages provide an excellent strategic forum for \n     meetings and exchanges, as demonstrated by the Millennium \n     Young People's Congress, to:\n       (1) Discuss issues and solutions for health, welfare, \n     peace, and the rights of children as a basic foundation for \n     all children and youth;

and be it further\n       Resolved, That the President of the United States and \n     members of the United States Congress are urged to support \n     the establishment of such a Center; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Matsunaga Peace Institute, the United \n     Nations Association in Hawaii, the House Committee on \n     International Affairs, and the Keiki Caucus of the Hawaii \n     State Legislature are requested to convene an exploratory \n     task force to develop such a proposal for consideration by \n     the UN; and be it further\n       Resolved, That assistance be sought from foundations and \n     other nongovernmental organizations who might assist in \n     funding the Center; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the World Youth Congress, which will be \n     holding its third meeting in Glasgow, Scotland, in August \n     2005, is urged to establish a Center dedicated to UN \n     Secretary General Kofi Annan; and be it further\n       Resolved, That certified copies of this Concurrent \n     Resolution be transmitted to the Secretary General of the UN, \n     Focal Point on Youth of the UN Office of the Secretary \n     General, Senior Policy Advisor for the UN Children's Fund, \n     President of the United States, President of the United \n     States Senate, Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives, members of Hawaii's congressional \n     delegation, United States Representative to the UN, President \n     of the University of Hawaii, President of the East-West \n     Center, Superintendent of Education, Executive Director of \n     the Hawaii Association of Independent Schools, President of \n     the United Nations Association in Hawaii, Director of the \n     Matsunaga Peace Institute, Program Director of the American \n     Friends Service Committee--Hawaii, President of the Hawaii \n     State Senate, and the Speaker of the Hawaii State House of \n     Representatives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/23/senate-section/article/S7311-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7311]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second times by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n           By Mr. JOHNSON:\n       S. 2561.

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. JOHNSON:\n  S. 2561. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to provide for \ncertain servicemembers to become eligible for educational assistance \nunder the Montgomery GI Bill; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a very \nimportant piece of legislation, the Montgomery GI Bill Enhancement Act. \nThis bill will allow a one year open enrollment period for thousands of \ncareer military personal who are not allowed to sign up for education \nbenefits under the Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB).\n  In 1976 Congress created the Veterans' Educational Assistance Program \n(VEAP) as a recruitment and retention tool for the post-Vietnam era. \nHowever, Congress greatly expanded education benefits in 1984 and \nallowed individuals with VEAP accounts to transfer their benefits to \nthe new MGIB in 1996. The opportunity to convert to MGIB was important \nbecause the benefits available were much greater than those under VEAP.\n  However, those individuals who were on active duty before 1985 and \ndid not participate in VEAP were not eligible to sign-up for MGIB, \nleaving a gap in available coverage for certain career military \npersonnel. Congress has voted several times in the last decade to allow \nVEAP participants opportunities to transfer to MGIB, but there has \nnever been an opportunity for those who did not have VEAP accounts to \nsign up for the new program, excluding them from taking advantage of \nMGIB educational benefits.\n  My bill would correct this inequity and allow individuals falling \ninto this gap to attain MGIB benefits. Organizations such as the Non-\nCommissioned Officers Association, the Association of the United States \nArmy, and the Military Coalition have come out in strong support for \nthis legislation.\n  I believe that we must do more to honor our Nation's commitments to \nour military personnel. As the father of a soldier in the Army, I fully \nappreciate what a poor ``quality of life'' can do to the morale of \nmilitary families. We have a long way to go, but I will continue to \nwork with my colleagues to make sure our country's military personnel \nreceive the benefits they deserve.\n  Today, there are fewer than 74,000 VEAP ``decliners'' on active duty. \nThese men and women have dedicated their lives to a career of service \nto the Nation, and many are deployed in harms way leading our troops in \nIraq and Afghanistan.\n  For these servicemen and women--many of whom are reaching retirement \neligibility--time is running out. Therefore, before it is too late, I \nencourage my Senate colleagues to support the Montgomery GI Bill \nEnhancement Act and provide our servicemen and women with the benefits \nthey deserve.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2561\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act \nprovide incentives for the furnishing of quality care under Medicare \nAdvantage plans and by end stage renal disease providers and \nfacilities, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Medicare \nQuality Improvement Act of 2004.''\n  This bill will establish a new payment incentive structure for \nquality health care, starting with the Medicare Advantage and End Stage \nRenal Disease programs. Under this policy, Medicare would give a \nfinancial boost to plans and renal care providers demonstrating the \nhighest quality care and a bonus to those that are working hard to \nimprove.\n  Why focus on quality? I hear from all corners that the U.S. health \ncare system is unsustainable in its current form. Costs are rising, and \nthe care provided is not always appropriate or necessary. Not to \nmention that 43 million Americans lack health insurance.\n  As I travel around Montana, I hear so much from so many constituents \nabout the rising cost of health care. Countless parents tell me they \nare struggling to pay for health care for their families, afraid that \none more illness will force them into bankruptcy. Working people tell \nme they fear their employers will raise their premiums or drop\n\n[[Page S7314]]\n\ncoverage altogether due to rising health care costs. And employers, \nboth large industries and small enterprises, tell me they face \ncompetition from companies in countries where healthcare is \nsignificantly less expensive. While these employers are trying to keep \njobs at home, health care costs are pushing them abroad.\n  And most recently, my personal experience with the health care system \nhas brought the issue of health costs and quality even closer to home.\n  A few weeks ago, I chose to have an elective procedure to keep my \nheart healthy. I have excellent health care coverage, and I was able to \nseek out excellent doctors and nurses at the Mayo Clinic. In short, I \nam fortunate that the care I received was high-quality care. The \ndoctors and nurses who took care of me were on the ball--making sure I \ngot the right medications with no dangerous interactions, using proper \nsurgical safety so I wouldn't get an infection, and providing good \nfollow-up care so I could get back to my family and back to work.\n  My experience with the health system was a positive one. \nUnfortunately, not everyone is as lucky. Ninety-eight thousand people \ndie every year in this country as a result of medical errors. That's \n270 people each day. An appalling statistic. Many of these deaths can \nbe prevented, and we must work to make sure that they are.\n  In addition to the cases of medical error we know about, there are \nmany that go unreported and even undetected. Studies have shown that \npatients in the U.S. receive recommended care and treatment when they \nvisit the doctor or hospital only about half of the time. Failure to \nfollow proper patterns of care or recommended guidelines can lead to \npoor outcomes, and it is also more expensive in the short and long run.\n  Errors can mean more trips to the hospital or to the doctor, more \ndrugs, and sometimes even additional surgeries. Each preventable \nmedication error costs about $4,700 in added hospital costs alone, not \nto mention the personal costs of childcare and lost wages, and the \nsocietal costs of lost productivity.\n  While not as fatal as actual errors, missed health care opportunities \nalso carry a cost. Each year, missed health care opportunities--\ninappropriate care and generally poor quality care costs the U.S. \nhealth system more than $1 billion dollars in avoidable hospital bills \nand 41 million lost work days, which costs American businesses about \n$11.5 billion. Improving the quality of health care can reduce health \ncare costs and stimulate our economy. In a time of slow economic growth \nand large deficits, health care is a compelling place to start.\n  Last year's Medicare Modernization Act got the ball rolling. The \nMedicare bill ties hospital reimbursement to reporting data on specific \nquality indicators. And hospitals are responding. Today, almost 2,000 \nhospitals are sharing data with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \non at least one of the quality measures. Knowing more about the care \nthat is delivered across the country should help us target incentives \nand resources to improve quality. It also provides employers and \npatients with new information about where to find the best deal for \ntheir health care dollar. And it also provides hospitals a way to \ncompare their performance to other hospitals.\n  The bill I am introducing today builds on this strong start. It would \nestablish a mechanism to pay for quality in the Medicare Advantage and \nEnd Stage Renal Disease Programs, through bonus payments for the best \nquality nationwide and bonuses for improving from one year to the next. \nRewards for improvement are an important piece of my proposal--last \nyear, the top ten percent of health plans in the country reported \nperfect scores on a set of quality indicators. There is no doubt that \nthey deserve recognition. But we don't want to leave behind smaller or \nhistorically poorer-performing organizations that are making major \nstrides to improve.\n  Medicare Advantage plans, which tend to utilize a coordinated model \nof care, have a unique opportunity to impact a patient's health \noutcomes--plans have access to information about a patient's medical \nhistory, and can follow patients more closely to ensure that they are \nreceiving appropriate preventive, acute, and follow-up care. Medicare \nAdvantage plans can translate their own payments into quality \nincentives downstream. They can reward providers for performing certain \nprocedures known to be effective, or for prescribing drugs known to \nhave equal or greater effectiveness at a reduced cost. And they can \nimprove a beneficiary's preventive and wellness benefits.\n  Dialysis clinics that participate in Medicare through the program for \npatients with End Stage Renal Disease have a momentous mission, helping \nthese patients enjoy life for years longer than we might have thought \npossible just a few decades ago. Because dialysis is such a complex \noperation, quality of care is extremely important.\n  Plans and providers in the Medicare Advantage and ESRD programs have \nalready started measuring and reporting on quality, which makes them an \nexcellent place to start. But I want to be clear these programs should \nnot be singled out simply because they are ahead of the game. Working \nwith ESRD providers and Medicare Advantage plans heralds the beginning \nof a longer journey, and we need to stay the course.\n  First, we need to monitor this quality incentive program and ensure \nthat the methods used to measure health care quality and evaluate \nperformance are evidence-based and valid.\n  Second, we should evaluate the impact of a pay-for-performance \nprogram on health plans and providers--particularly small organizations \nand those that are just entering the market. Additionally, because last \nyear's Medicare legislation made payment and policy changes to these \nproviders--for example, a short-term payment increase for ESRD and a \nnew payment policy and the addition of regional plans for Medicare \nAdvantage--we would need to keep a close eye on the consequences of \nthese changes and the interaction with the pay-for-performance quality \ninitiative and take action where necessary.\n\n  Third, we should look with a wide lens and move forward with quality \ninitiatives in all government health care programs. It is our \nresponsibility to set an example for the industry through quality \nimprovement programs in Medicare and Medicaid, including traditional \nfee-for-service Medicare.\n  As I mentioned, the National Voluntary Hospital Reporting Initiative \nis a groundbreaking program, but we need to do more in traditional \nMedicare to encourage high quality care. My bill sketches out a roadmap \nthat will lead us toward expanding the quality measures currently \ncollected for fee-for-service providers, and ultimately toward \nadditional Medicare payment systems that promote quality improvement.\n  We can also do more to focus on quality care in Medicaid. Today, \nthere are a number of people at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices whose responsibility it is to improve the quality of care in \nMedicare. On the Medicaid side, there is one person--one person who, \nwhile given the responsibility for quality, has no resources or \nauthority to develop program innovations.\n  You might say that quality is already addressed in Medicaid. I \napplaud my colleague and Chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator \nGrassley, for encouraging CMS to increase its quality improvement \nactivities for home and community-based services in Medicaid. We should \nbuild on this foundation and broaden the effort. We need to identify \nbarriers to quality improvement throughout the Medicaid program, and \ntake steps toward removing those barriers.\n  The bill I introduce today would target a few of those barriers, and \nit would require further studies to identify others. It authorizes \nmoney to hire new staff--experienced health professionals--to improve \nthe quality and coordination of care delivered to Medicaid \nbeneficiaries. It explores ways to integrate data on Medicaid \nbeneficiaries who are also enrolled in Medicare--the dual-eligibles and \ncoordinate the care they receive from both programs. Many dual-\neligibles are among the sickest and costliest beneficiaries. By better \ncoordinating their care we can improve health outcomes and save money \nin both programs at once.\n  As you can tell, I have a lot of ideas. But I have only scratched the \nsurface of this issue and am deeply committed to working with my \ncolleagues in the\n\n[[Page S7315]]\n\nSenate to move forward. This bill is a good start, but it is just \nthat--a start. We must do more.\n  Many of my colleagues in the Senate also care deeply about improving \nthe health care system, and I commend their efforts to develop \ncourageous proposals that will spark change. Senator Clinton introduced \na bill last year, the Health Information for Quality Improvement Act. \nMore recently, Senator Kennedy Introduced the Health Care \nModernization, Cost Reduction, and Quality Improvement Act.\n  These bills lay out a comprehensive array of policies to improve \nhealth care quality and reduce costs, and my bill focuses on one piece \nof that picture--paying for quality. They represent the gold standard \ntoward which we should all be working. But we share a common goal to \nmake the most of the American health care dollar, so that we can \nprovide better care to more people.\n  As I mentioned, health care in this country is more expensive than it \nis elsewhere. But we don't necessarily get more for our money. The \nUnited States spends twice as much on health care than any other \ncountry, but studies have shown that quality is about the same. Better \nin some areas, worse in others, but all in all about the same. No \nmatter how you cut it, that means that the value of our health care--\nwhat we are getting for each dollar is less in the United States than \nin other developed countries.\n  I've always believed that Americans were all about value. We are the \ncountry of start-up companies and the home of Wal-Mart. We know about \ngood business, and we know about hard work. We should know more--and do \nmore--about health care.\n  We are an amazing country, but today our health care system is sick. \nWhy? It is not the fault of hard-working doctors and nurses who put in \nlong hours to make their patients healthy. It is our fault. We need to \nsupport the work of health care professionals by providing the right \nresources and designing payment systems to promote quality. Today, it \ntakes an average 17 years for a new discovery in medical care to move \nfrom the lab bench into regular clinical practice. And for providers \nworking in settings without regular Internet access or without the \nluxury of time to peruse medical journals, it may take even longer. As \nMembers of Congress, we have the opportunity to change the system, to \nprovide incentives for good care, funding for research into best \nmedical practices, and to require the development and reporting of \nquality measures.\n  The road to this goal is long and difficult. I call on my colleagues \nfor their energy and support, and I call on health care professionals \nand the health insurance industry to work with us. This is challenging \nwork, and involves many difficult decisions. But I've never been one to \nshirk a challenge, and I hope you will join me. This bill is the \nbeginning of what must be a strong bipartisan push to improve our \nhealth care system--to increase quality of care, to reduce costs, and \nto strengthen the American spirit.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2562\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to require imported explosives to be marked in the \nsame manner as domestically manufactured explosives; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Hatch to introduce \nthe Imported Explosives Security Act. Domestic manufacturers are \nrequired to place identification markings on all explosive materials \nthey produce for important security reasons. These markings enable law \nenforcement officers to determine the source of explosives and help \nthem solve crimes. Yet, these same identifying markings are not \nrequired of those explosives manufactured overseas and imported into \nour country. This impedes law enforcement efforts and poses a security \nrisk.\n  The legislation we have introduced today is simple and \nstraightforward. The legislation would simply treat imported explosives \njust like those manufactured inside the United States, requiring all \nimported explosives to carry the same markings currently placed on \ndomestic explosives. It would require the name of the manufacturer, \nalong with the time, date and shift of manufacture, to be placed on all \nexplosives materials, whether they are manufactured here or abroad. \nThese markings can be a tremendously useful tool for law enforcement \nofficials, enabling investigators to determine the source of explosive \nmaterials. According to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and \nExplosives, the explosives can then be tracked through records kept by \nthose who manufacture and sell them, often leading them to the criminal \nwho has stolen or misused them. At a recent Senate hearing, FBI \nDirector Mueller acknowledged that ``determining the source of the \ncomponents to any explosive device will assist you in determining who \nwas responsible for any act using such a device.''\n  The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives first sought \nto fill this gap in the law when it published a notice of a proposed \nrulemaking in November 2000. Now, nearly 4 years later, this rulemaking \nstill has not been finalized. Each year, more than 25,000 pounds of \nstolen, lost, or abandoned explosives are recovered by law enforcement. \nWhen explosives do not carry appropriate markings, they\n\n[[Page S7321]]\n\ncannot be quickly and effectively traced for criminal enforcement \npurposes.\n  Millions of pounds of unmarked explosives have already been \ndistributed in this country. Each day we delay closing this loophole, \nwe let more untraceable explosive materials cross our borders and \nundermine our national security. Failure to address this very \nstraightforward issue in a timely manner unnecessarily hinders law \nenforcement's ability to solve crimes. Because the Department of \nJustice has not issued regulations to close this loophole in a timely \nmanner, it is now incumbent upon us to act for them.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAPO (for himself, Mr. Fitzgerald, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Smith, \n        Mr. Wyden, Mr. Craig, and Mr. Roberts):\n  S. 2565. A bill to amend the Agriculture Adjustment Act to convert \nthe dairy forward pricing program into a permanent program of the \nDepartment of Agriculture; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, \nand Forestry.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Milk Forward \nContracting Act, a bill to make permanent the dairy forward pricing \npilot program.\n  Without question, dairy producers are subject to a very fickle dairy \nmarket. Dairy prices can go from all time highs to all time lows over a \ncourse of a year, making long-term planning extremely difficult. This \nlegislation will ensure the continued availability of an important risk \nmanagement tool for dairy producers and enable their long-term business \nplanning.\n  Over the pat 4 years, dairy producers and processors have been able \nto voluntarily enter into agreements for the sale of a specific volume \nof milk for a set price over an established period of time trough the \ndairy forward pricing pilot program. Many producers in my home State of \nIdaho and nationwide have used this voluntary program to reduce \nmarketing risk by securing stable prices. Unfortunately, this program \nexpires in December of 2004, and dairy producers want to be able to \ncontinue to utilize this program.\n  Forward contracting is a very useful tool for dairy farmers. In fact, \na 2002 U.S. Department of Agriculture USDA report to Congress \ndemonstrated that the program has been effective in reducing price \nvolatility. According to USDA data for the September 2000 through \nDecember 2002 period, contracted milk averages $14.06 per hundredweight \nwith a range of $1.63 between high and low prices, while non-contracted \nmilk averaged $13.68 per hundredweight with a range of $6.69. \nAdditionally, the U.S. General Accounting Office GAO reported that \nforward contracting is a risk management tool most frequently used by \nproducers of other farm commodities.\n  Likewise, dairy producers should also have access to this important \ntool. There is no reason that dairy farmers should be forced to ride a \ndairy price roller coaster, when the extension of this sensible program \nwould provide farm families with an option to help plan for their \nfutures.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Lautenberg, Ms. \n        Stabenow, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Johnson, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Durbin, \n        and Mr. Dayton):\n  S. 2566. A bill to amend title II of the Social Security Act to phase \nout the 24-month waiting period for disabled individuals to become \neligible for medicare benefits, to eliminate the waiting period for \nindividuals with life-threatening conditions, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nentitled ``Ending the Medicare Disability Waiting Period Act of 2004'' \nwith Senators Corzine, Lautenberg, Stabenow, Clinton, Johnson, \nMikulski, Durbin, and Dayton. This legislation would phase-out the \ncurrent 2-year waiting period that people with disabilities must endure \nafter qualifying for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI). In \nthe interim, the bill would also create a process by which the \nSecretary can immediately waive the waiting period for people with \nlife-threatening illnesses.\n  When Medicare was expanded in 1972 to include people with significant \ndisabilities, lawmakers created the 24-month waiting period. According \nto a July 2003 report from the Commonwealth Fund, it is estimated that \nover 1.2 million SSDI beneficiaries are in the Medicare waiting period \nat any given time, ``all of whom are unable to work because of their \ndisability and most of whom have serious health problems, low incomes, \nand limited access to health insurance.''\n  As Karen Davis, president of the Commonwealth Fund, said of the \nreport, ``Individuals in the waiting period for Medicare suffer from a \nbroad range of debilitating diseases and are in urgent need of \nappropriate medical care to manage their conditions. Eliminating the 2-\nyear wait would ensure access to care for those already on the way to \nMedicare.''\n  These are people who are the most seriously disabled in our society \nand most in need of immediate health services. And yet, it is estimated \nthat one-third of the 1.2 million currently federal policy puts the \ndisabled on hold for 2 long years. The consequences are unacceptable \nand are, in fact, dire.\n  In fact, various studies show that death rates among SSDI recipients \nare highest during the first two years of enrollment. For example, the \nCommonwealth Fund report, entitled Elimination of Medicare's Waiting \nPeriod for Seriously Disabled Adults: Impact on Coverage and Costs, 4 \npercent of these people die during the waiting period. Of the estimated \n400,000 uninsured disabled Americans in the waiting period at any given \ntime, 16,000 of them will die awaiting Medicare coverage. This is \nunacceptable.\n  Moreover, this does not factor in the serious health problems that \nothers experience while waiting for Medicare coverage during the 2-year \nperiod. Although there is no direct data on the profile of SSDI \nbeneficiaries in the 2-year waiting period, the Commonwealth Fund has \nundertaken a separate analysis of the Medicare Current Beneficiary \nSurvey for 1998 to get a good sense of the demographic characteristics, \nincome, and health conditions of this group.\n  According to the analysis, ``. . . 45 percent of nonelderly Medicare \nbeneficiaries with disabilities had incomes below the federal poverty \nline, and 77 percent had incomes below 200 percent of poverty. Fifth-\nnine percent reported that they were in fair or poor health; of this \ngroup, more than 90 percent reported that they suffered from one or \nmore chronic illnesses, including arthritis (52%), hypertension (46%), \nmental disorder (36%), heart condition (35%), chronic lung disease \n(26%), cancer (20%), diabetes (19%), and stroke (12%).''\n  As the Medicare Rights Center has said, ``By forcing Americans with \ndisabilities to wait 24 months for Medicare coverage, the current law \neffectively sentences these people to inadequate health care, poverty, \nor death . . . Since disability can strike anyone, at any point in \nlife, the 24-month waiting period should be of concern to everyone, not \njust the millions of Americans with disabilities today.''\n  Although elimination of the Medicare waiting period will certainly \nincrease Medicare costs, it is important to note that there will be \nsome corresponding decrease in Medicaid costs. Medicaid, which is \nfinanced by both federal and state governments, often provides coverage \nfor a subset of disabled Americans in the waiting period, as long as \nthey meet certain income and asset limits. Income limits are typically \nat or below the poverty level, including at just 74 percent of the \npoverty line in New Mexico, with assets generally limited to just \n$2,000 for individuals and $3,000 for couples.\n  The Commonwealth Fund estimates that, of the 1.26 million people in \nthe waiting period, 40 percent are enrolled in Medicaid. As a result, \nthe Commonwealth Fund estimates that federal Medicaid savings would \noffset nearly 30 percent of the increased costs in its study. \nFurthermore, states, which have been struggling financially with their \nMedicaid programs, would reap a windfall that would help them better \nmanage their Medicaid programs.\n  Furthermore, from a continuity of care point of view, it makes little \nsense that somebody with disabilities must leave their job and their \nhealth providers associated with that plan, move on the Medicaid to \noften have a different set of providers, to then switch to Medicare and \nyet another set of providers.\n  And finally, private-sector employers and employees in those risk-\npools\n\n[[Page S7322]]\n\nwould also benefit from the passage of the bill. As the report notes, \n``. . . to the extent that disabled adults rely on coverage through \ntheir prior employer or their spouse's employer, eliminating the \nwaiting period would also produce savings to employers who provide this \ncoverage.''\n  I urge passage of this legislation and ask unanimous consent that the \ntext of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2566\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to adjust the boundary of Redwood National Park in \nthe State of California; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce companion \nlegislation to H.R. 3638, a bill introduced by Congressman Mike \nThompson in November 2003. This bill will adjust the boundary of \nRedwood National Park in the State of California to include the \naddition of the Mill Creek property.\n  In 2002, the California Department of Parks and Recreation acquired \nfrom the Save-the-Redwoods League 25,500 acres of forest land known as \nthe Mill Creek property in Del Norte County, which is contiguous with \nthe Redwood National and State parks boundary. This bill would include \nwithin the park boundary the Mill Creek acquisition and about 900 acres \nof land acquired and added to the State redwood parks since the 1978 \nexpansion of the Redwood National Park boundary. There would be no \nFederal costs for land acquisition or development resulting from this \nlegislation.\n  These lands will be managed by the same cooperative management \nagreement between the National Park Service and the California \nDepartment of Parks and Recreation. This partnership is viewed as a \nmodel of interagency cooperative management efforts and will provide \nfor more efficient and cost-effective management of an ecologically \nsignificant resource.\n  This bill enjoys strong support from local and Federal officials, \nincluding Del Norte County and the Department of the Interior. Given \nthis support and lack of controversy, I believe introducing companion \nlegislation to be of great importance to ensure that our Redwood \nNational Park is further protected.\n  I have long held a deep interest in protecting California's \nmagnificent Redwoods. The Headwaters Agreement that was negotiated in \npart in my offices in 1996 protected approximately 7,500 acres of old \ngrowth redwoods, which was the largest grove of redwoods held in \nprivate ownership at the time.\n\n[[Page S7323]]\n\n  I applaud Congressman Mike Thompson's commitment to this issue and \nhope that this bill receives strong bipartisan support.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BIDEN:\n  S. 2568. A bill to require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint \ncoins in commemoration of the tercentenary of the birth of Benjamin \nFranklin, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, \nand Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Benjamin \nFranklin Commemorative Coin Act. This bill will authorize the U.S. Mint \nto produce a limited edition silver coin, in two designs, to honor the \nachievements of Benjamin Franklin, America's distinguished scientist, \nstatesman, inventor and diplomat.\n  In 2006, the United States will host a worldwide celebration marking \nthe 300th anniversary of Franklin's birth on January 17, 1706. \nActivities, lectures and exhibits are being developed through the \nefforts of the Benjamin Franklin Tercentenary Commission, as ordered by \nthe Benjamin Franklin Tercentenary Commission Act, Public Law 107-202. \nThe Commission, on which I serve with other elected officials and \nprivate sector partners, is responsible for providing a proper tribute \nto one of our most remarkable founding fathers. Surcharges on the sale \nof the coin would help the commission pay for activities it plans for \ncelebrating Benjamin Franklin's birthday.\n  During the American Revolution, Franklin designed the first American \ncoin--the ``Continental'' penny--and, until 1979, he was the only non-\nPresident of the United States whose image graced circulating coin and \npaper currency. it is only fitting that we honor Franklin's legacy \nthrough issuance of a commemorative coin.\n  This bill is the Senate companion to H.R. 3024, which was introduced \nby my colleague from Delaware, Congressman Mike Castle, and it \npresently enjoys 326 cosponsors. As celebrations for our great leader \nare planned, I hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting a \ncommemorative coin for this important American. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the text of this bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2568\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend section 227 of the Communications Act of \n1934 to clarify the prohibition on junk fax transmissions; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Junk Fax \nPrevention Act of 2004, a bill to strengthen our laws on protecting \nconsumers and businesses from receiving unwanted commercial \nadvertisements by facsimile, while at the same time preserving a key \nmethod of doing business for thousands of companies, large and small, \nacross the United States. The sending of unsolicited commercial \ncommunications by facsimile--``junk faxes''--has been illegal since \n1991, and the Federal Communications Commission is charged with \nenforcing that prohibition. Those who engage in ``blast faxes'' can and \nshould be prosecuted to the full extent of the law, as their behavior \nimposes unreasonable expenses upon residential and business facsimile \nsubscribers.\n  However, the FCC has long recognized an exception to this general ban \non unsolicited faxes when the parties sending and receiving the fax \nhave an established business relationship. Businesses of all shapes and \nsizes regularly conduct their transactions via facsimile, such as real \nestate agents, wholesalers and distributors, travel agents, and those \nin the convention industry. In our modern economy, companies that are \noften hundreds or thousands of miles away from each other do business \ntogether, often with the same or greater frequency as with those just \nup the street. And the reality of business is that sometimes you need \nto communicate in writing, and it needs to get there right away.\n  The established business relationship exemption recognized this \nreality, and ensured that government was not placing an undue hardship \non business owners. Yet inexplicably, on June 26, 2003 the FCC issued a \nnew rule that eliminated the established business relationship. Under \nthis new rule--which is set to take effect on January 1, 2005--the \nsender of a fax would have to acquire, in writing, the permission of \nthe recipient to receive an unsolicited fax before the fax could be \nsent, even if the recipient made a verbal request that the information \nbe faxed.\n  As Chair of the Senate Small Business Committee, I can state that the \nbusiness community has in unison called upon Congress to take action to \nrectify this situation. Industry groups estimate that it will cost \nbusinesses an average of $5,000 in the first year alone to comply with \nthe new law, and as much as $3,000 each year thereafter in record-\nkeeping costs. These numbers do not take into account the potential \nlost business that could easily result if a primary method of business-\nto-business communication is cut off. Quite simply, small businesses in \nparticular will suffer significantly if these rules are allowed to take \neffect.\n  My bill will restore the established business relationship exemption, \nallowing standard business transactions to continue without inhibition. \nThe term ``Established business relationship'' means the same thing in \nthe Junk Fax Prevention Act as in the regulations governing the Federal \nDo-Not-Call Registry: it means that the fax subscriber either made an \ninquiry of the sender within the prior three months or a purchase from \nthe sender within the prior 18 months.\n  The Junk Fax Prevention Act also strengthens the protections \navailable to fax recipients by adding an opt-out provision that the \ncurrent law does not have. Even if an established business relationship \nexists, a fax subscriber can still request to not receive unsolicited \nfaxes. The senders of these faxes must, by law, honor these requests, \nand they must include a notification of this right on every fax they \nsend.\n  As a strong supporter of consumer rights, I also want to assure my \ncolleagues that this bill does not in any way place consumers at risk. \nVery few consumers own fax machines, and those who do are protected by \nthe general ban on solicitation and the opt-out provision if they do \nhave an existing business relationship. To ensure that the privacy of \nconsumers and businesses is protected, my bill also provides for \nstudies by both the General Accounting Office and the FCC to evaluate \nthe effectiveness of enforcement.\n  Small businesses have weathered the storm of the economic downturn \nover the past several years. As our economy now climbs out of recession \nand people return back to work, American businesses--our nation's \nemployers do not need these unnecessary economic restraints to further \nhinder their recovery. I call upon all of my colleagues to join me in \nbringing relief to American businesses and pass the Junk Fax Prevention \nAct.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2569\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Junk Fax Prevention Act of \n     2004''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Res. 389\n\n       Whereas in 2004, it is estimated that approximately 230,000 \n     new cases of prostate cancer will be diagnosed in the United \n     States, and nearly 30,000 men in the United States will die \n     from prostate cancer;\n       Whereas prostate cancer is the second leading cause of \n     cancer death in men in the United States;\n       Whereas more than $4,700,000,000 is spent annually in the \n     United States in direct treatment costs for prostate cancer;\n       Whereas African-American men are diagnosed with and die \n     from prostate cancer more frequently than men of other ethnic \n     backgrounds;\n       Whereas increased education among health care providers and \n     patients regarding the need for prostate cancer screening \n     tests has resulted in the diagnosis of approximately 86 \n     percent of prostate cancer patients before the cancerous \n     cells have spread appreciably beyond the prostate gland, \n     thereby enhancing the odds of successful treatment;\n       Whereas the potential complication rates for significant \n     side effects vary among the most common forms of treatment \n     for prostate cancer;\n       Whereas prostate cancer often strikes elderly people in the \n     United States, men should have an opportunity to learn about \n     the benefits and limitations of testing for prostate cancer \n     detection and of treatment of prostate cancer, so that they \n     can make an informed decision with the assistance of a \n     clinician; and\n       Whereas Congress as a whole, and Members of Congress as \n     individuals, are in unique positions to support the fight \n     against prostate cancer, to help raise public awareness about \n     the need to make screening tests available to all people at \n     risk for prostate cancer, and to provide prostate cancer \n     patients with adequate information to assess the relative \n     benefits and risks of treatment options: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) national and community organizations and health care \n     providers have played a commendable role in supplying \n     information concerning the importance of screening for \n     prostate cancer and the treatment options for patients with \n     prostate cancer; and\n       (2) the Federal Government and the States should ensure \n     that health care providers supply prostate cancer patients \n     with appropriate information and any other tools necessary \n     for prostate cancer patients to receive readily \n     understandable descriptions of the advantages, disadvantages, \n     benefits, and risks of all medically efficacious screening \n     and treatments for prostate cancer, including brachytherapy, \n     hormonal treatments, external beam radiation, chemotherapy, \n     surgery, and watchful waiting.\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am pleased to be joined by my \ncolleagues Senators Johnson, Bunning, Chambliss, Lindsey Graham, Burns, \nand Lincoln to submit legislation which would express the Sense of the \nSenate that physicians inform prostate cancer patients of all of their \ntreatment options. The non-binding resolution which we are introducing \nstresses the importance of presenting all options to men diagnosed with \nprostate cancer.\n  Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death of men in \nthis country and is particularly devastating for men over the age of \n50. In 2004, it is estimated that approximately 230,000 new cases of \nprostate cancer will be diagnosed in the United States, and nearly \n30,000 men will die from the disease. Clearly, the effort to raise \npublic understanding about treatment options is crucial.\n\n[[Page S7326]]\n\n  I believe that patients should be provided with accessible and \ncomprehensive information about all available treatment options in an \neffort to enable them to select the therapy most appropriate for their \nunique conditions. Understanding both the cure rates and the quality of \nlife implications of each approach is essential in making an educated \ndecision.\n  Last week an identical resolution passed the House by a vote of 377-\n3. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. Let's take an \nimportant step forward in the fight against prostate cancer.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 390--DESIGNATING SEPTEMBER 9, 2004, AS ``NATIONAL \n                 FETAL ALCOHOL SPECTRUM DISORDERS DAY''\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI (for herself and Mr. Daschle) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 390\n\n       Whereas the term ``fetal alcohol spectrum disorders'' has \n     replaced fetal alcohol syndrome as the umbrella term \n     describing the range of effects that can occur in an \n     individual whose mother drank alcohol during pregnancy;\n       Whereas fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are the leading \n     cause of mental retardation in western civilization, \n     including the United States, and are 100 percent preventable;\n       Whereas fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are a major cause \n     of numerous social disorders including learning disabilities, \n     school failure, juvenile delinquency, homelessness, \n     unemployment, mental illness, and crime;\n       Whereas the incidence rate of fetal alcohol syndrome is \n     estimated at 1 out of 500 live births and of fetal alcohol \n     spectrum disorders is estimated at 1 out of every 100 live \n     births;\n       Whereas the economic cost of fetal alcohol syndrome alone \n     to the Nation was $5,400,000,000 in 2003 and that each \n     individual with fetal alcohol syndrome will cost United \n     States taxpayers between an estimated $1,500,000 and \n     $3,000,000 in his or her lifetime;\n       Whereas in February 1999, a small group of parents of \n     children who suffer from fetal alcohol spectrum disorders \n     came together with the hope that in 1 magic moment the world \n     could be made aware of the devastating consequences of \n     alcohol consumption during pregnancy;\n       Whereas the first International Fetal Alcohol Syndrome \n     Awareness Day was observed on September 9, 1999;\n       Whereas Bonnie Buxton of Toronto, Canada, the co-founder of \n     the first International Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Awareness Day, \n     stated the purpose of the observance as: ``What if . . . a \n     world full of FAS/E parents all got together on the ninth \n     hour of the ninth day of the ninth month of the year and \n     asked the world to remember that during the 9 months of \n     pregnancy a woman should not consume alcohol . . . would the \n     rest of the world listen?''; and\n       Whereas on the ninth day of the ninth month of each year \n     since 1999, communities around the world have observed \n     International Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Awareness Day: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates September 9, 2004, as ``National Fetal \n     Alcohol Spectrum Disorders Awareness Day''; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling upon the people of the United States to--\n       (A) observe ``National Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders \n     Awareness Day'' with appropriate ceremonies to--\n       (i) promote awareness of the effects of prenatal exposure \n     to alcohol;\n       (ii) increase compassion for individuals affected by \n     prenatal exposure to alcohol;\n       (iii) minimize further effects; and\n       (iv) ensure healthier communities across the United States; \n     and\n       (B) observe a moment of reflection on the ninth hour of \n     September 9, 2004, to remember that during the 9 months of \n     pregnancy a woman should not consume alcohol.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/23/senate-section/article/S7326-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7326]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED & PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3474.

Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I ask \nunanimous consent to be added as a cosponsor of the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, the notion of reflecting for a moment \nat 9:09 a.m. on September 9, to recognize that during the 9 months of a \npregnancy a woman should consume no alcohol, originated with three \nindividuals. They weren't lobbyists or public relations consultants or \nsocial marketing experts. They were parents raising fetal alcohol \nchildren.\n  In February of 1999, Bonnie Buxton and Brian Philcox of Toronto, \nCanada and Teresa Kellerman of Tuscon, AZ, all parents of fetal alcohol \nchildren, asked each other a question.\n  The question was, ``What if a world full of fetal alcohol parents all \ngot together on the ninth hour, of the ninth day of the ninth month of \nthe year and asked the world to remember that during the nine months of \npregnancy a woman should not drink alcohol?'' They asked, ``Would the \nworld listen?''\n  This simple question launched a worldwide, grassroots movement, \norganized on e-mail list serves and on the World Wide Web to ask that \ncommunities everywhere observe Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Awareness Day on \nSeptember 9. The first International Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Awareness \nDay, or FASDAY as it is known, was observed on September 9, 1999. In \nthe ensuing years, the number of communities observing FASDAY has grown \nand grown. I am proud that my State of Alaska strongly supports the \nobservance of FASDAY and has published a kit of materials to help \ncommunities in my State and elsewhere plan their local observances.\n  Thanks to the support of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, \nthe U.S. Senate will add its voice in support of this worldwide \nobservance, with the adoption of my resolution designating September 9, \n2004, as National Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders Day, which is the \nnew name for FASDAY. I especially appreciate the support of the \ndistinguished minority leader, a longstanding supporter of the fight \nagainst fetal alcohol related diseases and a founder of the National \nOrganization on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome.\n  We choose to call September 9 National Fetal Alcohol Spectrum \nDisorders Day because science has established that Fetal Alcohol \nSyndrome is just one of a number of disorders that can befall a child \nborn to a woman that consumes alcohol during pregnancy. The number of \nchildren born with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome each year dwarfs the number \nborn with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders.\n  But whatever you call it, women must know that consumption of alcohol \nduring pregnancy is the single largest contributor to mental \nretardation,\n\n[[Page S7347]]\n\nlearning disabilities and birth defects, and all of the fetal alcohol \nspectrum disorders are completely preventable if a woman consumes no \nalcohol during the 9 months of pregnancy.\n  By adopting this resolution we honor Bonnie and Brian and Teresa and \nall of the grassroots volunteers who have worked so hard in their \ncommunities around the globe to educate women about the dangers of \nalcohol during pregnancy and we recognize the States, counties and \ncities that have answered the call and organized local observances \naround International Fetal alcohol Syndrome Awareness Day.\n  A message is simple--alcohol and pregnancy don't mix. No alcohol \nduring the 9 months of pregnancy, period. The world is listening.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and that any statements relating to this matter be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 390) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 390\n\n       Whereas the term ``fetal alcohol spectrum disorders'' has \n     replaced fetal alcohol syndrome as the umbrella term \n     describing the range of effects that can occur in an \n     individual whose mother drank alcohol during pregnancy;\n       Whereas fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are the leading \n     cause of mental retardation in western civilization, \n     including the United States, and are 100 percent preventable;\n       Whereas fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are a major cause \n     of numerous social disorders including learning disabilities, \n     school failure, juvenile delinquency, homelessness, \n     unemployment, mental illness, and crime;\n       Whereas the incidence rate of fetal alcohol syndrome is \n     estimated at 1 out of 500 live births and of fetal alcohol \n     spectrum disorders is estimated at 1 out of every 100 live \n     births;\n       Whereas the economic cost of fetal alcohol syndrome alone \n     to the Nation was $5,400,000,000 in 2003 and that each \n     individual with fetal alcohol syndrome will cost United \n     States taxpayers between an estimated $1,500,000 and \n     $3,000,000 in his or her lifetime;\n       Whereas in February 1999, a small group of parents of \n     children who suffer from fetal alcohol spectrum disorders \n     came together with the hope that in 1 magic moment the world \n     could be made aware of the devastating consequences of \n     alcohol consumption during pregnancy;\n       Whereas the first International Fetal Alcohol Syndrome \n     Awareness Day was observed on September 9, 1999;\n       Whereas Bonnie Buxton of Toronto, Canada, the co-founder of \n     the first International Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Awareness Day, \n     stated the purpose of the observance as: ``What if . . . a \n     world full of FAS/E parents all got together on the ninth \n     hour of the ninth day of the ninth month of the year and \n     asked the world to remember that during the 9 months of \n     pregnancy a woman should not consume alcohol . . . would the \n     rest of the world listen?''; and\n       Whereas on the ninth day of the ninth month of each year \n     since 1999, communities around the world have observed \n     International Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Awareness Day: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates September 9, 2004, as ``National Fetal \n     Alcohol Spectrum Disorders Awareness Day''; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling upon the people of the United States to--\n       (A) observe ``National Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders \n     Awareness Day'' with appropriate ceremonies to--\n       (i) promote awareness of the effects of prenatal exposure \n     to alcohol;\n       (ii) increase compassion for individuals affected by \n     prenatal exposure to alcohol;\n       (iii) minimize further effects; and\n       (iv) ensure healthier communities across the United States; \n     and\n       (B) observe a moment of reflection on the ninth hour of \n     September 9, 2004, to remember that during the 9 months of \n     pregnancy a woman should not consume alcohol.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/23/senate-section/article/S7347-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7347]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         SURFACE TRANSPORTATION EXTENSION ACT OF 2004, PART III\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to consideration of H.R. 4635, which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the House passed an African Growth and \nOpportunity Act extension by voice vote last week. This is an important \nbill for the continued economic development of sub-Saharan Africa.\n  To date, AGOA, as it is known--the African Growth and Opportunity \nAct--has created 150,000 jobs, some believe even many more than that.\n  We cleared that House bill on our side of the aisle last week. We are \nwaiting for some other clearances from the other side of the aisle.\n  Initially, we were going to ask UC this evening to call up the bill \nand pass the House bill today. I think we are making tremendous \nprogress. We have had discussions on the floor on both sides of the \naisle today, and therefore I will withhold making that unanimous \nconsent request. I am very hopeful, based on progress, that with some \nfurther discussions we will be able to clear this bill tomorrow.\n  Our intention is to clear the bill or, if not, to formally ask \nunanimous consent to pass the bill before we adjourn for the July 4 \nrecess, given the importance of this bill.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, if the majority leader will yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will just confirm the conversations \nthat the majority leader alluded to. I think we have made real \nprogress, certainly, on both sides of the aisle. There are a couple of \nother consultations required, but it would be my hope that before the \nend of the week we would be able to complete our work on the AGOA bill.\n  This is an important piece of legislation. It has demonstrated its \njob-building capacity in Africa in particular. We are very hopeful that \nwe can continue that success in the years ahead by reauthorizing this \nimportant legislation. So we will have more to say about this tomorrow.\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}]
