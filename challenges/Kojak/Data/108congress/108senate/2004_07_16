Mr. President, I want to briefly comment on a headline \nfrom an article from the U.K. Daily Independent. It could have been \nreally from any periodical, but the headline says, ``AIDS reduces \nAfrican life expectancy to 33.'' That is 33 years of age. In my office \nthis morning, I came across this, and it hits me that this little virus \nwe have lived with since the early 1980s, when it was first described \nand detected in this country--in this country nobody had died of this \nlittle virus, but then 5 people died, 100 died, and now thousands of \npeople in this country have died; and then it killed about 500,000 \npeople, and then a million, and then 5 million, and then 23 million \npeople have died. It is destroying the continent of Africa, where the \nlife expectancy is 33 years of age.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the article printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S8270]]\n\n                [From the UK Independent, July 16, 2004]\n\n               AIDS Reduces African Life Expectancy to 33\n\n                         (By Elizabeth Davies)\n\n       The AIDS pandemic is ravaging countries in sub-Saharan \n     Africa, drastically reducing life expectancy in some parts to \n     less than 33 years, a new UN report said yesterday.\n       The devastating impact of the crisis can be seen most \n     clearly in seven African countries, including Malawi and \n     Mozambique, where babies born in 2002 are not expected to \n     live past 40 years because of the prevalence of HIV. Children \n     in Zambia, where 17 per cent of the population are infected \n     with the virus, are predicted to live just 32 years. The \n     seven countries have, between them, seen an average drop in \n     life expectancy of 13.5 years since 1990, the UN human \n     development report said.\n       ``In all these countries, AIDS is reversing the hard-won \n     development gains of recent decades,'' said Elizabeth Lwanga, \n     the deputy director of the United Nations Development \n     Programme (UNDP) for Africa. ``We need an unprecedented \n     response to this crisis, which is taking a devastating toll \n     on our communities.''\n       With almost a quarter of its population infected with the \n     virus, Zimbabwe has been the country most dramatically \n     affected. Life expectancy there has plummeted from 57 years \n     in 1990 to 34 in 2002.\n       In Swaziland, where one in three people between the ages of \n     15 and 49 are AIDS sufferers, life expectancy has dropped by \n     almost 20 years, and in Botswana, where the disease affects \n     37 per cent of the population, people can expect to live 16 \n     years less now than in 1970.\n       Sub-Saharan Africa is home to just over 10 per cent of the \n     world's population--and to almost two-thirds of all people \n     living with HIV. In 2003, an estimated three million people \n     in the area became infected for the first time, while 2.2 \n     million died. As a result, many of the countries are \n     considerably poorer than they were a decade ago; 13 of them \n     are virtually the first countries in the UNDP report's \n     history to have suffered a reversal in living standards.\n       The UNDP administrator, Mark Malloch Brown, said that the \n     virus caused such destruction because it affected all aspects \n     of life. Those who fell victim to the disease left behind \n     them countries struggling to cope with the loss of such a \n     large proportion of the workforce.\n       ``The AIDS crisis cripples states at all levels, because \n     the disease attacks people in their most productive years,'' \n     said Mr. Malloch Brown. ``It tears apart the foundation of \n     everything, from public administration and health care to the \n     family structures.''\n       Mohga Kamal-Smith a health policy adviser for Oxfam, \n     pointed to the failure of the international community as one \n     of the main reasons for the devastation. ``As the epidemic \n     spread, the donor contributions from richer countries went \n     down,'' she said. ``Hardly any of the governments have \n     achieved the 0.7 per cent GDP contribution that they \n     committed to.''\n       The UNDP's annual report shows the drop in contributions \n     from the highest-ranked countries in the list, particularly \n     from Norway and the United States.\n       The lead author of the report, Sakiko Fukada-Parr, \n     acknowledged that the most afflicted countries face enormous \n     problems but said she believed that solutions may be found.\n       ``AIDS is currently presenting a very basic problem in \n     human development,'' she said. ``But other countries, like \n     Senegal and Brazil, have achieved partial success in fighting \n     the disease, due to easily accessible medicine and all \n     elements of the countries getting involved.''\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, in part, the second paragraph in the \narticle says:\n\n       The devastating impact of the crisis can be seen most \n     clearly in seven African countries, including Malawi and \n     Mozambique, where babies born in 2002 are not expected to \n     live past 40 years because of the prevalence of HIV.\n\n  Without going into details of the causes, that dramatic impact \ndemands, for a moral reason, a strong international response. I am \nproud that the United States is leading that moral response. This \ncrisis is one of the great moral, humanitarian public health crises of \nour times. We need to address that.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. FRIST. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Daschle and I traveled to Africa a couple years ago \nthis August. I was stunned then to go to Botswana where the average \nlife expectancy is 39 years. Since then, it has dropped even lower. As \nwe speak, people are dying. They are losing about 7,500 a day on the \ncontinent of Africa. So I am very glad that the majority leader, who is \na physician, is following this. This is something that I don't know \nwhat we can do about. We are trying, and we have joined with the \nadministration to try to do something about it.\n  Later in the day, would the leader be in a position to tell us more \nregarding what we are going to do next week?\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, yes, I certainly will. There are a number \nof issues, and we will talk about it later this morning. We will be in \nnext week, including Monday. I would like to have the Myers vote early \nTuesday afternoon. We have the Defense Appropriations bill which will \nbe coming back from the House. As soon as it comes back, that very \nimportant bill we have acted on in the Senate will be addressed \ncertainly next week. In addition, the Democratic leadership and the \nRepublican leadership have begun discussions. There is likely to be \nanother conference report coming back from the House with regard to a \ntax package. Nobody in the conference has to determine what the package \nactually is, but it will focus on issues like the 10-percent tax \nbracket, extension of the child tax credit, marriage penalty relief, \nthose sorts of issues that I suspect will be addressed on the floor of \nthe Senate next week. We can discuss other business. Next week will be \na busy one. It will be our last week before going on a very long \nrecess.\n  Finally, on Botswana, the Senator from Nevada mentioned two things. \nFirst of all, Senator Daschle and your delegation went about a year and \na half ago. We followed that the next year with another bipartisan \ndelegation to very similar countries. It takes that sort of direct \nparticipation on our part to go and see the travesty, the devastation, \nand to see that a large portion of these societies has been wiped out \nby this little virus which we can cure eventually. I am confident. It \ntakes that participation on our part. I encourage our colleagues, even \nthough people say Senators need to stay right here in the United \nStates, to do traveling, interaction, dialog, observation. Since those \ntwo journeys, we have been able to come back and we can, with pride, \nsay we are the world leader in addressing this moral public health \nchallenge. That comes from action here, translated into action on the \nfloor, which is what we have done.\n\n  In Botswana, if we compare 1970 to today--and this article points it \nout--someone born in 1970 would have lived 16 more years if this virus \nhad not been around. So it has cut 16 years, comparing 1970 to today, \noff someone's life expectancy in Botswana, where the assistant \nDemocratic leader and I visited. It is a tough problem, one we can \naddress together.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, Botswana is a model democracy, a great \ncountry, great leadership, no corruption. I will respond briefly to the \ndistinguished majority leader.\n  My last trip to Africa was a life-changing experience. I had been to \nother places, but to see the spread of AIDS was a life-changing \nexperience for me, to see the orphans. The orphans are an epidemic in \nAfrica. All these little kids have no parents, both parents having died \nfrom AIDS. To see the personal devastation of communities being wiped \nout and people not being educated is a terrible situation.\n  Having come to this body from the House of Representatives, I served \nthere on the Foreign Affairs Committee. I agree with the distinguished \nmajority leader, part of our job is to find out what is going on in the \nrest of the world, and I think our taxpayers are well paid by what we \ndo here by our going and seeing what is going on in other parts of the \nworld. We have responsibilities being the only superpower in the world. \nI am glad to see the majority leader does not cringe from the fact he \nhas traveled, and he is trying to find out what is going on in other \nparts of the world. I believe, without any reservation or question, \nthat those Senators who choose not to travel--and it is a personal \ndecision, but I think it is a bad decision.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, we were talking about Africa, but this \nlittle virus right here in Washington, DC, is killing people every day. \nWhen we talk about Africa, we use that as a model, at least for me. It \ncould equally be Russia where the rate is probably the fastest growing \nin the world, or Haiti. Senator DeWine constantly reminds us how Haiti \nhas been devastated.\n  When we talk Africa, HIV/AIDS, we are really talking about a virus \nthat knows no boundaries--Washington, DC, Nashville, TN, across the \nworld--and that is important to research and development. If we kill \nthe little virus, it\n\n[[Page S8271]]\n\nhelps people here in the District, it helps people across this country, \nHaiti, India, Russia, and that is why it is so important; that is why \nwe are pulling together the great science we have today. Once we get \nrid of the virus, it goes away across the world.\n  I did not intend to talk about this little virus except that it is so \ndevastating.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/16/senate-section/article/S8271-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8271]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, over the course of the last several \nweeks, many of us have come to the floor to talk about the question \nraised by our former President, Ronald Reagan, back in the 1980 \nPresidential campaign. His question at that time, which we are told was \nparaphrased from a question posed by Franklin Roosevelt in 1934, was: \n``Are you better off than you were four years ago?''\n  Unfortunately, in 2004, the answer to that question is all too clear \nfor most middle-class Americans. Four years ago, our economy was \nbooming. The stock market had reached record heights. Twenty-two \nmillion jobs had been created in 8 years. We built a record Federal \nsurplus. And millions of American families enjoyed newfound prosperity \nand felt the optimism of even better times ahead.\n  Four years later, we have lost nearly 2 million private sector jobs, \nthe stock market has dropped, record surpluses have turned to record \ndeficits, and middle-class families are truly being squeezed.\n  This chart tells the story. Since President Bush came to office, \nwages have been stagnant. Average weekly earnings have not increased in \nthe last 4 years, but the costs facing Americans have skyrocketed. Gas \nprices have increased 23 percent; college tuition has gone up 28 \npercent; and family health care premiums, as we can see from the chart, \nhave actually increased 36 percent.\n  All that has come out of average weekly earnings, which have been \nstagnant.\n  This is not what was predicted. This certainly is not what the White \nHouse said would happen under its economic policies.\n  In his annual economic report released in February, the President \npredicted the economy would create 3.8 million jobs in 2004.\n  As of today, we are still 2.5 million jobs short of that goal. Even \nmore troubling, the jobs being created today pay less than the jobs we \nhave lost. And even Americans who have been fortunate enough to keep \ntheir jobs have failed to see the pay raises they need and they \ndeserve.\n  Just this morning we received confirmation from the Department of \nLabor that working Americans are still being squeezed by this economy. \nIn fact, the new numbers indicate the squeeze is actually getting \nworse. According to the Labor Department, real earnings in June fell \n$2.16, the second largest monthly drop in 14 years.\n  The Labor Department report also reveals what has happened over the \npast year. As this chart shows, the real earnings of our working people \nover this last year have actually decreased by 1.4 percent. They have \nless purchasing power today than they did in June 2003. But a typical \ncommodity, a grocery that most families buy every week, milk, has gone \nup 30 percent. All this money is coming out of weekly earnings.\n  As people across the country know, gas prices have also risen \ndramatically. There was an article on the front page of the Wall Street \nJournal about this development. It concluded that at current prices, \nthe average driver will pay nearly $300 more for gasoline this year \nthan last year. And the story only gets worse when it comes to \nprescription drugs.\n  According to a recent report by the AARP, drug companies raised their \nprices for the top 200 brand-name drugs at nearly three times the rate \nof inflation in the first 3 months of 2004. Some of my colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle think these increases are less important to \nAmerican families than the rise of gross domestic product, GDP. But \nAmericans don't live on GDP, they live on earnings. That is what they \nuse to pay for milk, gas, medicine, health insurance, and tuition. They \nlive on earnings, and those earnings clearly are not keeping up with \nthe costs they are facing today.\n  Remarkably, the administration's response to this problem has been to \nfurther undermine wages by limiting overtime rights. This week, an \nindependent study showed that the White House's new overtime \nregulation, which goes into effect next month, will strip 6 million \nworkers of their right to overtime. That is unacceptable. Democrats \ncontinue to fight at every opportunity to reverse the administration's \nmisguided policy. Middle-class Americans are being squeezed, and the \nlast thing they need is for their Government to make it worse.\n  What Congress should do is raise the minimum wage. It has been 8 \nyears since we last voted to raise it. In that time it has become \nnearly impossible for minimum wage workers to make ends meet, \nespecially when they are trying to raise a family. In my home State of \nSouth Dakota, a worker earning the minimum wage has to work 82 hours a \nweek to afford rent for a two-bedroom apartment. And that is without \ntaking into account other family costs, such as clothing, groceries, \nand health care.\n  Of course, not everyone in America is feeling the pinch. As this \nchart shows, while workers continue to struggle, our big corporations \nare thriving. In just the past year, corporate profits have risen 30 \npercent. The White House likes to talk about how we are now in an \neconomic recovery. That is true for corporate America. But American \nworkers are being left behind. As the New York Times recently reported, \ntake-home pay, as a share of the economy, is at its lowest level since \nthe Government started keeping track in 1929.\n  Economic policies that lead to these kinds of results don't do right \nby middle-class families, and they don't do right by America.\n  The good news is, we can do right by America. We proved during the \nClinton administration that we can create millions of jobs, raise \nwages, and increase the quality of life for families all through the \ncountry. We did right by America then, and we can do it again.\n  With the help of the American people, and with some resolve by this \nbody, we will do it again.\n\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I have taken the last several days on a \ndaily basis to come to the Senate floor to talk about the treacherous \nand damaging leak of the identity of a covert CIA operative by the name \nof Valerie Plame, leaked to a columnist by the\n\n[[Page S8272]]\n\nname of Robert Novak, reportedly by high-ranking White House officials. \nI spoke a number of times last year when the events occurred. I spoke \nabout it before a special prosecutor was assigned to investigate. After \nthat special prosecutor was assigned, I did not say much more because I \nbelieved things would take their course, the special prosecutor would \ndo his job, and we would get to the bottom of this.\n  July 14 marked 1 year, and this being July 16, it is now 1 year and 2 \ndays since we first learned of the exposing or the outing of Valerie \nPlame as a covert CIA operative.\n  That was the date 1 year ago when this columnist, Robert Novak, \npublicly exposed Ms. Plame. This was done in an act of political \nretribution because her husband, former Ambassador Joseph Wilson, \npublished a column in the New York Times that questioned one of the key \nadministration justifications for the war in Iraq; namely, that Iraq \nsought to buy yellow cake uranium ore from Niger.\n  Sadly, Republicans are still at it. They are fixated on Mr. Wilson. \nThey are intent upon destroying his credibility. In columns and \neditorials and floor statements, the smear campaign continues. Their \nreason is they want to deflect and distract from the fact someone in \nthe White House--high ranking--appears to have committed a crime, a \ntreacherous crime.\n  I am not here to defend or criticize Joe Wilson. I have tried to \nfollow the debate over his findings and statements and all that. \nObviously, we are all concerned about finding out the facts about \nwhether Saddam Hussein's government did try to obtain yellow cake \nuranium ore from Africa, the country of Niger, in the 1990s. That is a \nquestion of importance. But none of that has anything to do with the \nway we judge an illegal White House action that was used to undermine \nand endanger human intelligence resources, and was done only to \ndisparage Mr. Wilson.\n  Here is the statute, and it is clear, 50 U.S.C., section 421. It \nsays:\n\n       Any person who has access to classified information that \n     identifies a covert agent and intentionally discloses that \n     information to an unauthorized person, knowing that the \n     Government is seeking to keep the agent's identity concealed, \n     shall be fined under Title 18 or imprisoned not more than 10 \n     years, or both.\n\n  Robert Novak said it in his column. He said it was high-ranking White \nHouse officials who gave him the information. We know that one or two \nhigh-ranking White House officials called, I think, up to six reporters \nto give them that information. Interestingly enough, it was only Mr. \nNovak who published this in a column.\n  Mr. Novak has been around this town a long time. He also had to know \nthis was a violation of law to come out with the name of a covert CIA \nagent. Yet Mr. Novak put that name in his column. Shame on Mr. Novak. I \nam not certain that it is totally unclear as to whether he could also \nbe prosecuted under the same provisions of law, 50 U.S.C., section 421. \nHe also identified a covert agent.\n  Now, under the law, there is no exception for cases where a spouse of \nthe agent has questioned administration policy. It doesn't say in the \nlaw that a person could be fined under title 18 or imprisoned for not \nmore than 10 years, or both, unless the spouse of the agent questioned \nthe administration policy. It doesn't say that in the law.\n  I understand the ongoing investigation by prosecutor Fitzgerald has \nbeen somewhat thorough. However, I have repeatedly criticized the \nPresident and Vice President for refusing to settle the matter quickly, \nwhich they could have done a year ago. Again, I am calling for the \nspecial prosecutor to put the President and the Vice President under \noath--put them under oath and film it.\n  This is what they did to President Clinton. The special prosecutor \nput him under oath and filmed it. We sat here in the Senate and watched \nit. That had to do with actually something, I guess, that wasn't even a \ncrime. It may have been immoral, but it wasn't a crime--certain \nindiscretions committed by the President in the White House.\n\n  What are we talking about here? We are talking about the exposure of \nthe identity of a covert CIA agent, destroying her credibility, putting \nat risk all of her contacts and people she had worked with around the \nworld. And, as we have learned from other retired CIA agents, this also \nputs a cloud over all other covert CIA operatives who may think that \nsometime in the future they too could be outed. What about all of their \ncontacts who may think that, well, gee, I know someone who was giving \ninformation to Ms. Plame. Now, they may know that person was giving \ninformation, and I may have another contact. Well, I guess I better not \nget involved in that because they may out my source or my contact, \nalso.\n  I cannot emphasize enough the seriousness of this crime. Yet the \nPresident treated it rather cavalierly when he was asked about it. He \nsaid: You know, there are leaks all over the White House. It is a big \nadministration. We may never find out who did it. And he smiled, as if \nthis was not a big deal. It is a very big deal. Someone in the White \nHouse--to this Senator's thinking--committed treason. The number of \npeople in the White House with access to this kind of information can \nbe counted on one hand--OK, maybe two hands. Maybe there are 10 people. \nBut what the President should have done was call them into his office, \nhave them sign a piece of paper that they did not do this, put them \nunder oath.\n  The President could have solved this in 24 hours. Yet he sort of \ndismissed it out of hand, as though it was not a big deal.\n  Well, that is why I think the President and the Vice President must \nbe put under oath and asked about this. Perhaps they do know. Perhaps \nthe President does know who leaked this information and is just \ncovering it up. Perhaps the Vice President also knows and he is just \ncovering it up.\n  You have to look at what happened and how this whole thing \nprogressed, and why the administration obviously is trying to deflect \nthis onto Mr. Wilson and others, because the chronology of events shows \nthat the administration clearly knew these claims were not real. So you \nhave to look at the chronology.\n  Let me summarize it and then I will go through it. Even after CIA \nDirector Tenet told the White House not to use this information in a \nspeech, and even after the State Department later came out and said \nthat some of these documents were forgeries, even after the same \nindividual who had talked to Director Tenet in October and had taken \nthe words out of the speech--that same individual put those words back \nin the President's State of the Union Message 3 months later. Curious, \nvery curious.\n  By the fall of 2002--let me put it more succinctly. In October of \n2002, the White House sought to include the claim that Iraq had tried \nto buy uranium from Africa in a policy speech by the President in \nCincinnati.\n  What did the CIA do? Here is the chronology. In February 2002, Joseph \nWilson travels to Niger to find out whether Iraq had attempted to buy \nuranium ore. On October 5, 2002, after the President indicated he was \ngoing to give a speech in Cincinnati and these claims were in the \nspeech, the CIA sends a memo to the National Security Council concerned \nabout these uranium claims in the Cincinnati speech. That is October 5.\n  They must have clearly felt they were not being taken seriously, \nbecause the following day a second memo was sent that urged that the \ninformation be deleted because the evidence was weak and the CIA had \ntold Congress that ``the Africa story was overblown, and this is one of \nthe two issues where we differed with the British.''\n  They must have been still pretty seriously concerned because CIA \nDirector Tenet personally calls Deputy National Security Adviser \nStephen Hadley. He personally called him.\n  Get this, they send a memo on the 5th, they send a memo on the 6th, \nand the Director himself calls on the 6th. So obviously they were very \nconcerned about it. Guess what. Mr. Stephen Hadley--keep that name in \nmind--Deputy National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley takes the claims \nout of the speech the President gives in Cincinnati.\n  Then on October 16, the State Department gets copies of uranium \npurchase documents and forwards them to the CIA. I am told this came \nfrom the Italians. I don't know if that is right or not, but that is \nwhat I was told. This is what they claim were forgeries. This is what \nour State Department analyst\n\n[[Page S8273]]\n\ntells the CIA later on, that the documents are likely forgeries.\n  On January 13, 2 weeks before the State of the Union, a State \nDepartment analyst sent an e-mail to the CIA about the documents, \noutlining his reasons why the uranium purchase agreement is probably a \nhoax. This is a State Department analyst who sends an e-mail to the CIA \nsaying these are probably a hoax, forgeries.\n  So between the Cincinnati speech in October and the State of the \nUnion speech in January, there is even more reason to doubt the \ncredibility of these uranium purchase claims. Nonetheless, these \nmysterious 16 words--``The British Government has learned that Saddam \nHussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from \nAfrica''--were left in the State of the Union speech.\n  Here is where we come full circle. Who is the individual responsible \nfor vetting national security issues before the State of the Union \nspeech? Mr. Stephen Hadley oversees the State of the Union speech. Mr. \nHadley was vetting national security concerns.\n  Let's loop back. It was Mr. Hadley who talked to Director Tenet in \nOctober and who got these memos saying these claims were not real. \nStephen Hadley in October took them out of the Cincinnati speech. Mr. \nHadley in January leaves them in the State of the Union speech. It is \nthe same individual. He could not have forgotten this. He had to have \nknown this.\n  Why, I ask, was this left in the State of the Union Message? Was it \nleft in to help the President make his case for an invasion of Iraq? \nAfter being told it was dubious by the CIA Director himself, after the \nState Department said these were probably forgeries, the issue is, Why \nthe White House still has not been held accountable for breaking the \nlaw and betraying the intelligence community by exposing Valerie Plame, \nall done in an attempt to discredit her husband Joseph Wilson and his \ncriticism of the uranium claim.\n\n  The President says he did not know anything about it. Ken Lay of \nEnron last week claimed he did not know anything about what was going \non in his company, either. He is the CEO, and what is his defense? ``I \ndidn't know it was going on.'' Either the CEO of a corporation knows \nwhat is going on and he is not being truthful or he did not know \nanything about it. Either way, it is inexcusable. If the President of \nthe United States says he did not know anything about it, that is \ninexcusable. If the President did know about it and left that claim in \nhis State of the Union Message, that is inexcusable. Either way, the \nbuck stops on President Bush's desk. It is time to quit passing the \nbuck. It is time for the American people to learn who committed these \ncrimes and to have these people prosecuted.\n  What is going to happen in the future if this is swept under the rug? \nDoes that mean some other administration, the next one, whatever it may \nbe, Democratic or Republican, that a President or his people under him \nin the White House can break the law and not be held accountable?\n  Again, I take you back several years to when President Clinton was \nput under oath and filmed. We watched it right here on the Senate floor \nduring the impeachment proceedings. Regardless of how one may have felt \nabout that, it sent a very powerful message to the American people: No \nPresident is above the law; no President is above the law, neither Mr. \nClinton nor Mr. Bush.\n  So I ask, Why hasn't President Bush, why hasn't Vice President Cheney \nbeen put under oath and asked these questions under oath? Again we will \nlet the American people know that no President is above the law and no \none who works for a President is above the law.\n  This is serious business. I see that in a column by Mr. Novak of July \n15--Mr. Novak's whole column is about Joe Wilson--he said:\n\n       It's as though the Niger question and Joe Wilson have \n     vanished from the Earth.\n\n  No, they have not, Mr. Novak; no, they have not. But Mr. Novak is all \non whether Mr. Wilson was telling the truth, whether he was \nmisinterpreted, whether his wife recommended that he be sent to Niger. \nNowhere is it claimed Ms. Plame was in a position of authority to \nactually send him to Niger, but Mr. Novak goes on about how a State \nDepartment analyst told the committee about an interagency meeting in \n2002 by Wilson's wife who had recommended that he go there because he \nhad contacts there.\n  What does all this mean? It means what Mr. Novak is trying to do is \nto take the focus off of a clear violation of the law by individuals in \nthe White House in exposing a covert agent's identity; take it off that \nand focus it on all this stuff about whether she recommended her \nhusband, or whether her husband gave an honest analysis. I am sorry, \nMr. Novak, that is not the issue. The issue is, someone in the White \nHouse broke the law, clearly, unequivocally. The point is, the \nPresident of the United States has expressed not one iota of outrage. \nThe point is, the President and the Vice President, neither one, have \nsought to get to the bottom of this. Neither the President nor the Vice \nPresident have been put under oath to be questioned about this.\n  The point is, Mr. Novak, a year and 2 days have passed, and this \nlawbreaking activity in the White House has not been dealt with. No one \nis saying Ms. Plame broke any law, violated any ethics. No one is \nclaiming Mr. Wilson broke any law or violated any ethics. You can say \nthey may have made a mistake, he may have been wrong, he may have been \nwrong in his analysis--fine. I am not saying he was right or wrong. I \ndon't know. What I do know is, two individuals in the White House broke \nthe law--to my way of thinking, basically committed treason--and no one \nis getting to the bottom of it. And Mr. Novak continues to try to \ndeflect the attention from that, to try to talk about whether Mr. \nWilson was right in his analysis.\n  That is not the point. You can debate that issue if you want. What is \nnot debatable is that someone in the White House broke the law, and \nthey should be held accountable.\n  As I took the floor yesterday and the day before and the day before, \nI take the floor today, and I will every day that we are in session, to \nask that simple question: Why isn't the President coming clean? Why \nisn't he getting to the bottom of this? Why, 1 year and 2 days later, \nhas nothing happened in the White House to find the identity of these \nlawbreakers? The sooner we get to the bottom of it, the sooner we can \nallow the criminal justice system to do its job.\n  I call upon the President and the Vice President to get to the bottom \nof this. I call upon the special prosecutor to put them under oath and \nto ask them these questions. That may be the only way we get to the \nbottom of it.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/16/senate-section/article/S8273-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8273-S8274]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           OBESITY IN AMERICA\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in a few minutes we will be closing out for \nthe weekend. I will briefly comment on a couple of current issues \nbefore addressing some of the business before the Senate.\n  The first issue is a brief comment on President Bush's decision or \nhis administration's decision yesterday to have the Federal Medicare \nProgram recognize obesity as a disease.\n  Earlier today, we were talking about public health issues, and I \nmentioned in some African countries, because of an HIV/AIDS virus, the \ntotal length of life will be 33 years of age. In Botswana, if you were \nborn in 1970, you would live 17 years longer than if you are born today \nbecause of that little virus. I mentioned that. That has gotten worse \nover the last 30 years, which we probably did not know anything about \nin this country until about 20 years ago. And it is getting much worse.\n  Another problem, very similar to that, is one that is apparent to \nanybody who has kids today and picks them up from school. If you just \nwatch, you see the kids are much heavier than 20 years ago, 30 years \nago. And that has lifelong consequences. It comes down to obesity.\n  There are many reasons for obesity, and I am not going to address all \nthe\n\n[[Page S8274]]\n\nreasons now. But there are things we can do, and we have a real \nobligation to do.\n  It is a brand-new problem--or new in the last 20 years. It is getting \nworse and worse, and it condemns these kids to a life of poorer quality \nand shorter length. It is something we absolutely must address.\n  I applaud the administration's decision yesterday. What they did is \nsaid obesity--which before was this kind of vague syndrome or \nobservation--is a disease, and when you call it a disease, people \nrecognize it as a disease, and then you start looking at prevention, \ncare, and treatment to reverse it. That is the significance.\n  Two things: First, for the first time, a major Federal health program \nrecognizes obesity as a disease. It is a treatable disease--preventable \nbut also treatable. The second is that it demonstrates, once again, \nthat Secretary Thompson and the administration are taking extremely \nseriously the obesity epidemic which is occurring in this country.\n  The administration is attacking obesity on a multitude of fronts. It \nis needed. In my mind, it is long overdue that this Nation address this \nnew but rapidly growing epidemic.\n  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention--or the CDC, as we all \nknow it--reports that because of poor nutrition and lack of physical \nactivity, obesity is on its way of surpassing smoking as the leading \nkiller in the United States of America. Obesity is on its way of \nsurpassing smoking as the leading killer in the United States of \nAmerica.\n  Obesity contributes to other diseases, the diseases in which I \nspecialize; that is, heart conditions, heart disease. It also affects a \nwhole range of issues: orthopedic, pulmonary injuries as well.\n  The immediate impact will be twofold. First of all, it will be easier \nfor Medicare beneficiaries and individuals with disabilities who are \nMedicare beneficiaries to get treatment. The barrier to treatment will \nbe lowered.\n  When Medicare makes a decision, it has a spillover impact to the \nprivate sector. I think the spillover impact will be substantial, \nalthough the private sector has already moved ahead. They have already \nincreased reimbursement for appropriate treatment for obesity in many \nareas. But the fact that the Federal Government speaks with a loud \nvoice will have an impact on the private sector.\n  The public and private sector have to be very cautious. We talk about \nthis on the floor of the Senate every time there is a new definition of \nsomething that needs to be treated. We have to be very cautious in \ndeciding which specific treatments to cover. We need to make sure the \ninterventions are effective, but we need to also make sure they are \ncost effective.\n\n  There are several treatments now for obesity that are available. \nScience will allow us to determine which of these treatment modalities \nare most effective and which are most cost effective.\n  Also--this applies to the HIV/AIDS virus, which I mentioned earlier \ntoday, and to obesity, which I mention now--prevention is a critically \nimportant aspect of the equation. Early intervention, especially among \nchildren, is the key to preventing lifelong obesity and obesity-related \nillnesses.\n  Nonetheless, I want to applaud the administration for this bold step. \nIt will help prevent obesity and greatly improve strategies for helping \nnot only seniors and individuals with disabilities but all Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/16/senate-section/article/S8274-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8274]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 SUDAN\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, there is a second issue I want to mention \nthat I addressed 2 weeks ago on the floor of the Senate and want to \nfollow up on. It has to do with a tragic situation in Sudan, in the \nwestern part of Sudan in the three states of Darfur, Sudan.\n  The situation there, even over the last 3 weeks, has steadily \ndeteriorated. We have hundreds of thousands of refugees that are \ncurrently at risk. We are entering the rainy season there, and that \nmakes the delivery of relief supplies very difficult.\n  Since my comments on the floor of the Senate, Secretary of State \nPowell, in the first week of this month, went to the Darfur region and \nmade observations and certain requests. At about the same time, \nSecretary General Kofi Annan also visited the region and made certain \nrequests. Senator Brownback, our distinguished colleague from Kansas, \nsubsequent to their visit, also visited the region and made \nobservations and with a video camera took some traumatic footage of the \ndevastation going on there. Another delegation from the House will be \ngoing shortly.\n  We have to take action to address this humanitarian problem. The \nadministration is working hard to get relief to these people who are \nsuffering, but there is systematic violence that is going on against \nthe civilian populations in Darfur by the government and by the \nmilitias that are supported by the government. That violence must come \nto an end.\n  I spend a lot of time in the Sudan and each year go to southern Sudan \nas part of medical mission work that I do. In the coming weeks or \nmonths, I will be returning to Sudan as part of this medical mission \nwork. I look forward at that point in time to seeing if we are having \nan impact in both the southern part of the Sudan but also in the Darfur \nregion and will report back to this body. Hopefully we will be able to \nreport that we are making progress. Two million people are being \naffected by this crisis, so it is a large crisis. I do ask the \nGovernment of Sudan to take immediate steps to end the violence in that \npart of the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/16/senate-section/article/S8274-2", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8274]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RETIREMENT OF POLICE CHIEF JERRY HOOVER\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to express my congratulations \nto Reno Police Chief Jerry Hoover on his retirement. The City of Reno \nand the State of Nevada owe this public servant a tremendous debt of \ngratitude for his hard work and strong dedication to law enforcement \nand the public safety.\n  Although Mr. Hoover spent 36 years in law enforcement, his service to \nour Nation in fact began with his combat service in Vietnam with the \n101st Airborne Division. Since then he has dedicated his life to making \nour Nation's communities safer and has served admirably the people of \nSan Diego, CA; Boulder, CO; St. Joseph, MO; and Reno, NV.\n  Chief Hoover provided strong and innovative leadership during a very \nchallenging time for the Reno Police Department. Like police agencies \nthroughout the country, the department under Chief Hoover's leadership \nhas significantly expanded its responsibilities in recent years to meet \nour Nation's homeland security needs.\n  Reno's police officers have met this new challenge while also \npolicing one of our Nation's fastest-growing metropolitan areas.\n  During his tenure, Chief Hoover helped create the Reno Model PTO \ntraining program that provides post-Academy police training with an \nemphasis on critical thinking and problem-solving. He also effectively \ndrew on the resources of the entire Reno community to meet the city's \nlaw enforcement and public safety needs by initiating the Senior \nAuxiliary Volunteer Effort program, which trains volunteers 50 and \nolder to assist with park and school patrols and special community \nprojects.\n  Despite the demands of his position, Chief Hoover still found time to \nhelp train the next generation of law enforcement professionals through \nclasses at the University of Nevada, Reno, and Nevada State College in \nHenderson. Even after his retirement from the Reno department, Chief \nHoover will continue his lifelong commitment to effective law \nenforcement as a consultant to police agencies throughout the country.\n  Chief Hoover has led a distinguished career marked by generous \nservice. Please join me in congratulating him on his retirement from \nthe Reno Police Department and in wishing him luck in all his future \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/16/senate-section/article/S8274-3", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8274-S8276]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HUMAN TRAFFICKING\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise today to highlight the scourge of \nhuman trafficking. Every day, in countries around the world and right \nhere in the United States, people desperate for economic opportunity \nand seeking to follow their dreams of a better life are lured from home \nby the promises of jobs and security. Sadly, though, all too often they \nfind themselves trapped in a nightmare, imprisoned by violent \ncriminals, abused, violated, deceived, bought, and sold as chattel. \nSome of these victims of trafficking disappear, never seen nor heard \nfrom again.\n  Every year, traffickers strip thousands of people of their freedom \nand\n\n[[Page S8275]]\n\nimprison them in the dark underworld of prostitution, domestic \nservitude, sweat shops, and agricultural labor.\n  Trapped in debt bondage and faced with threats of physical harm to \nthemselves or their families, trafficked persons have little choice but \nto try to work off their ballooning debts. Women forced into domestic \nservitude or sweatshop labor toil each day in abysmal, even dangerous \nconditions, earning no money and suffering physical and psychological \nabuse. And women and children trafficked into the sex industry \nconstantly risk exposure to deadly diseases such as HIV and AIDS. Their \nonly ``escape'' from the traffickers coming, if at all, is when the \ncriminals discard them in the streets to die. This human trafficking is \nnothing short of modern day slavery.\n  Each year the United States publishes a report ranking countries for \ntheir failure to combat trafficking. Improvements have been made, but \nstill the 2004 Trafficking In Persons Report estimates that 600,000-\n800,000 men, women, and children are trafficked worldwide across \ninternational borders; 14,500-17,500 are trafficked annually into the \nUnited States. This is even more chilling when one understands that \nthese are new victims added each year to those whom traffickers have \nalready ensnared. We must do better.\n  Last week, the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, \nCivil Rights, and Property Rights focused on the most fundamental of \nall civil rights in their July 7 hearing ``Examining U.S. Efforts to \nCombat Human Trafficking and Slavery.'' And this week, representatives \nfrom NGOs and the Bush administration, including the Departments of \nJustice, State, and Homeland Security, are convening in Florida for the \n``National Conference on Human Trafficking.'' It is heartening to see \nthe work begun by the Clinton Administration continues to grow and \nstrengthen.\n  The scourge of trafficking in women and children was a priority for \nme as First Lady and continues to be a priority for me as a U.S. \nSenator. I will do everything in my power to shine a light on this dark \nworld that is so contrary to human dignity. Since the United Nations \nFourth World Conference on Women in 1995, I have been working to raise \nawareness of the heinous practice of buying and selling women and \nchildren like commodities. I have seen the devastation it causes, and \nthe lives and families it ruins. I remember very well crouching down by \nthe chair of a 12-year-old girl who had been sold into prostitution by \nher own parents desperate for the income from that sale, only to have \nthe child return home within a year, dying of AIDS. I have met other \nfamilies who spend their nights at home worrying about what has \nhappened to the daughter they haven't heard from since she went to the \ndiscotheque, or answered the ad to be a nanny or a clerk.\n  In the summer of 1997, I met with women leaders from Eastern and \nCentral Europe, as well as victims' family members who, with tears in \ntheir eyes, pleaded with me for help in dealing with this growing \nproblem. Later that year, in Lviv, Ukraine, I launched a new \ninformation campaign designed to warn young women about the dangers \nposed by traffickers. And in the fall of 1999, at the meeting of the \nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe held in Istanbul, \nTurkey, I announced a $1 million U.S. commitment to combat trafficking, \nand I called for greater economic opportunities to prevent young women \nfrom being driven into the hands of traffickers.\n  In recent years, beginning with the leadership of the Clinton \nadministration, the U.S. has made great strides in understanding the \nhorrors of trafficking. We have worked with other nations to combat \nthose who try to reap profits from this horrible practice. In 1997, the \nUnited States, along with the European Union, formally launched a \ncampaign to combat trafficking of women and girls and to warn potential \nvictims of the risks. In March of 1998, President Clinton condemned \nhuman trafficking as a fundamental human rights violation and a growing \norganized crime problem. I joined the President, Secretary of State \nAlbright, Attorney General Reno, U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, and \na high-ranking member of the Thai government for a White House \nannouncement of the first presidential directive to prevent and deter \ntrafficking and to protect victims. At that time, the President \ndirected his interagency Council on Women to coordinate the development \nand implementation of a three-part strategy that would: first, prevent \ntrafficking; second, provide protection and assistance for trafficking \nvictims; and third, prosecute traffickers. This comprehensive strategic \nframework later guided the development of the anti-trafficking \nlegislation passed by Congress.\n  The Clinton administration's State Department began raising the issue \nwith foreign governments at the highest levels. Formal and informal \nworking partnerships were forged with several foreign governments to \naddress this international crisis, including the Ukraine and Finland. \nAt the G-8 meeting in 1997, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright \ninitiated discussions that resulted in 1998 with President Clinton and \nItalian Prime Minister Prodi formally signing the first bilateral \nagreement to cooperate on such anti-trafficking efforts as data \ncollection and information sharing, prevention, assistance and law \nenforcement. We began the first U.S. funding of anti-trafficking \nprograms in countries such as the Philippines and Bangladesh. Back \nthen, no anti-trafficking legislation had passed so these were \nnecessarily modest amounts by comparison to U.S. funding now, but it \nwas a needed start.\n\n  There was more. Embassies were tasked with reporting on human \ntrafficking for the first time. And these assessments were included in \nthe Department's annual Country Reports on Human Rights Practices. \nPrevention efforts included publishing awareness pamphlets that were \ntranslated into multiple languages and distributed in many consular \noffices around the world. At the same time, the U.S. undertook the \nfirst official estimates of the magnitude of human trafficking world-\nwide and domestically, and funded the creation of a database on U.S. \nand international legislation on trafficking. Law enforcement training \nwas initiated at the International Law Enforcement Academy in Bangkok \nand Budapest and in countries such as Thailand, Bulgaria, Romania and \nBosnia.\n  The Attorney General and the Secretary of Labor established an \ninteragency Task Force to coordinate investigations and prosecutions of \ntrafficking cases. Even prior to the passage of the 2000 anti-\ntrafficking law, the Department of Justice used the legal tools \navailable to successfully prosecute human traffickers. In 1995, the \nDepartment brought the seminal case of United States v. Manasurangkun \nagainst traffickers who enticed seventy-one women from Thailand to \ntravel to the United States by promising them good wages, good working \nhours, and a better life. Upon their arrival in El Monte, CA, they were \nheld in slavery behind barbed wire and forced to work up to twenty hour \ndays and under the watch of guards. Women were imprisoned for up to 7 \nyears before being rescued. This case was followed by other landmark \ncases such as United States v. Paoletti, United States v. Flores, \nUnited States v. Cadena and United States v. Mishulovich. These and \nother cases successfully prosecuted by the Justice Department ranging \nfrom sexual slavery to forced labor demonstrated the many \nmanifestations of human trafficking, all of which must be addressed. \nInvestigations resulting from the Justice Department's creation of the \nfirst national telephone line to receive calls to assist trafficking \nvictims anywhere in the United States led to growing prosecutions. I am \npleased that since the anti-trafficking legislation was passed and \nsigned into law in 2000, prosecutions have continued to increase. \nAgain, though, we need to do more to support increasing the capacity to \nundertake the investigations and prosecutions of these cases.\n  Just as the Clinton administration and international organizations \nwere beginning to highlight trafficking in persons as an international \ncrisis, Senator Paul Wellstone--one of the greatest champions of civil \nrights to sit in this chamber--also recognized this growing abuse of \nhuman rights. He introduced, with Senator Dianne Feinstein, a \nresolution in 1998 that called trafficking a global human rights \nproblem and directed the State Department to review it and report its \nfindings to\n\n[[Page S8276]]\n\nCongress. Congresswoman Louise Slaughter introduced a companion \nresolution and the led the charge in the House to bring attention to \nthis issue.\n  The Clinton administration worked with Senator Wellstone, his \nRepublican co-sponsor, Senator Brownback, and Congressman Chris Smith \nand former Congressman Sam Gejdenson in the House, to introduce the \nfirst comprehensive anti-trafficking bill in Congress. This culminated \nin the passage of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection \nAct of 2000.\n  I supported adoption of the strongest possible legislation to \neradicate trafficking in persons, and I was personally invested in the \neffort. The Clinton administration worked continuously with Congress on \na bi-partisan basis to craft a bill to achieve this objective. We \nsought to institutionalize the comprehensive strategic framework--the \n``3 Ps''--that the Administration had been implementing as the core of \nthe legislation. The resulting legislation incorporated prevention \nmechanisms and better and stronger prosecution, protection, and victim \nassistance tools. Upon its passage, President Clinton congratulated \nCongress and noted that this new law would lay the groundwork for \nfuture administrations to carry this important work forward, and would \nensure that trafficking of persons assumes the prominent place on the \nworld's agenda that it deserves until we put an end to this horrible \npractice. I believed then, and I believe now, that this is one of the \nClinton administrations greatest achievements and one of the most \nimportant parts of Senator Wellstone's legacy. That law means the \ndifference between freedom and enslavement for unknown numbers of \npotential trafficking victims for years to come.\n  I was also proud to support and work with Senator Brownback on the \npassage of the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of \n2003. I know that Senator Wellstone would welcome our work in the \nSenate, and Chris Smith's continuing leadership in the House, as we \nfight one of the most egregious human rights violations, which Paul so \npassionately sought to bring to an end.\n  Looking forward, we must pursue concrete and pragmatic approaches to \ncombating this evil. Our rhetoric must be matched by our actions so \nthat the United States government's seven year record of progress and \nsuccess can continue and intensify. The fight against trafficking, like \nthe fight against all forms of violence, must be supported with \ncomprehensive strategies effectively implemented and appropriately \nfunded here and abroad. There is still much to be done.\n  The United States must do more to combat trafficking within our own \nshores. Trafficking victims exist in our midst, in towns large and \nsmall. We must target resources on training and equipping law \nenforcement authorities to identify trafficking victims, victims too \noften mischaracterized as ``illegal migrants'' and deported. And we \nmust provide funds for NGOs working on the front lines in the United \nStates to provide care and legal assistance to victims of all forms of \ntrafficking.\n  I applaud and support State initiatives to combat trafficking. \nHowever, we must ensure that State and Federal authorities work \ncooperatively to combat this scourge. These welcome state efforts must \naugment the ongoing Federal fight against human trafficking. The \nFederal Government cannot retreat, but must do more to focus on victims \nnationwide. We must ensure that our Federal law enforcement authorities \ncontinue to have the financial and human resources necessary to \ninvestigate these crimes. We must further support our Federal, State, \nand local law enforcement, investigators, and prosecutors in efforts to \nmobilize in an integrated and coherent way to respond appropriately to \nthe organized criminal enterprises of human trafficking who still \noperate with relative impunity here and around the world. We must \nensure that we adopt a consistent and coordinated national response to \nthese human rights violations.\n\n  Without witness protection and an appreciation of the risks that \ntrafficking victims face in testifying against the perpetrators of \nthese horrible crimes, the prosecution record will not improve. \nConferences are a beginning, but not an end in themselves.\n  We must do more to tailor specific responses to the special needs of \nthe children who are trafficked, especially in terms of care and \nprotection. Root causes such as economic deprivation demand and warrant \ngrowing attention. There are no short-term fixes. The incidence of \nretrafficking among children, many who have attempted to flee homes of \nviolence and abuse or have been sold by their families, must be \naddressed.\n  Finally, the Senate must ratify the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and \nPunish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, \nsupplementing the U.N. Convention against Transnational Organized \nCrime. The United States played a major role in developing this new \ninternational law on trafficking. Through the annual TIP reports we \nhave communicated our expectation to the world that all countries will \njoin in our fight against human trafficking. Now, for the sake of our \nown credibility abroad, we must show our own commitment to abide by \ninternational norms on trafficking.\n  The TIP report is a powerful tool for combating trafficking around \nthe world. The threat of economic sanctions has inspired many countries \nto ramp up their efforts to combat trafficking within and across their \nborders. We must work closely in partnership with countries who are \nstriving to do better and maintain the pressure on countries who are \nnot. Meeting minimum standards is not enough. We must not shy away from \nranking as Tier 3 those countries that fail to do their part in the \nglobal fight against trafficking.\n  The simple fact is that we must do better in terms of demanding \neffectiveness of our programs and the significant funds that are spent \nby our government in the U.S. and around the world. There is no \nquestion that we are making progress, but we must do better for the \nsake of the victims of trafficking who try to endure, waiting and \npraying for our intervention in their nightmare. Every day, more women \nand girls are being sold into the sex industry, domestic servitude, \nsweatshop labor, debt bondage, and other forms of modern-day slavery. \nAnd more and more men, women, and children are being forced into \nvarious forms of manual labor, without any pay or any protection. These \ncrimes are violations of human rights and human dignity, and the United \nStates will not rest until they are stopped.\n  I am pleased that President Bush has carried on our country's \ncommitment to combat human trafficking. The progress we have made to \ndate has been the result of strong bipartisan efforts that brought the \nhorrors of trafficking to light. I hope we will continue to address \nthis challenge in a bipartisan way.\n  With the passage of important legislation and Congress's \nappropriation of much-needed funds to address this problem we have the \nopportunity to accomplish many things around the world and here at home \nto reduce human trafficking that we could only dream of before. The \nadministration has declared its intention to spend $150 million over \nthe next two years to reduce human trafficking. Support for these \nefforts is needed now more than ever because of the stark reality that \nin the four years since the legislation was signed into law there \nnevertheless remains no evidence that human trafficking is diminishing.\n  It was Senator Wellstone who observed that despite some progress on \nhuman trafficking we must be impatient for better results. I believe \nthat the need to be impatient is now more urgent than ever. In the \nfight against trafficking in persons, patience simply is not an option. \nWe are making progress, but there is still so much more that needs to \nbe done.\n  No country has done more than the United States to bring worldwide \ntrafficking out of the shadows and into the glare of public attention, \nand I am committed to doing whatever I can to help continue that \nleadership. I look forward to working with the administration and both \nsides of the aisle on additional improvements to the current \nlegislation and effective strategies for implementing it \ninternationally and domestically.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/16/senate-section/article/S8277-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8277]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S8277]]\n                    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following bill was read the first and second times by unanimous \nconsent, and placed on the calendar:\n\n       H.R. 2828.

Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. SANTORUM (for himself and Mr. Cornyn):\n  S. 2681. A bill to establish a program to support a transition to \ndemocracy in Iran; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to offer remarks about a \nbill that Senator Cornyn of Texas and I have introduced, the Iran \nFreedom and Support Act of 2004. This legislation seeks to promote the \ntransformation of the Islamic Republic of Iran to a democratic form of \ngovernment.\n  Our bill expresses the sense of the Congress that it should be the \npolicy of the United States to support regime change in Iran and that \nthe U.S. government should promote the transition to a new democratic \nIranian government. In addition, so as to help make this transition \npossible, our bill authorizes the President to provide up to $10 \nmillion in assistance to qualified foreign and domestic pro-democracy \ngroups opposed to the non-democratic government of Iran. To maximize \nthe efforts of these pro-democracy groups, our bill authorizes \nactivities such as aid to pro-democracy radio and television \nbroadcasting organizations as a way of directly reaching the people of \nIran.\n  For many years now, the people of Iran have dramatically demonstrated \ntheir desire for greater social and political freedoms. Literally \nmillions of Iranians have massed in the streets of the major cities, \ndemanding the right to choose their form of government and their own \nleaders. Even public opinion polls conducted by the dictatorial regime \nshow upwards of seventy percent of Iranians want democratic change. But \nIran remains in the grip of a brutal tyranny that has silenced \ndissident voices by arbitrary arrests, closure of newspapers and \nmagazines, destruction of satellite television dishes, widespread \ntorture and the second-highest execution rate in the world.\n  Our bill seeks to help the Iranian people achieve freedom by \nsupporting pro-democracy groups and enabling freedom-supporting Farsi \nlanguage radio and television broadcasting stations to broadcast \ninformation directly to Iran.\n  The current leaders of the Islamic Republic of Iran are not only \nbrutal tyrants. Their support of anti-American elements and terrorist \norganizations poses a direct threat to the interests of the United \nStates and our allies. For two decades, the Department of State has \nidentified Iran as THE leading sponsor of international terrorism. Iran \nhas been linked to the deaths of United States military personnel in \nBeirut, Lebanon, and Saudi Arabia. Iran has long provided financial and \noperational assistance to Hezbollah and is presently the leading state \nsponsor of Hamas and Islamic Jihad, who conduct lethal attacks against \nthe citizens of Israel.\n  Finally, Iran may be engaged in a crash program to develop nuclear \nweapons. In October 2003, after strong and concerted pressure by the \ninternational community, Iran agreed to sign an agreement to suspend \nuranium enrichment and open its nuclear facilities to more intrusive \ninternational inspections. Despite this pledge, Iran has repeatedly \nwithheld key information and documentation about its clandestine \nnuclear efforts. In February 2004, blueprints containing instructions \nfor building a type of gas centrifuge known as the P2, a super-\nefficient machine used in producing enriched uranium, were discovered. \nThe Iranians had not revealed these plans.\n  Additionally, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has found \nmultiple traces of highly-enriched uranium, with no civilian use, at a \nKalaye Electric Company workshop in Tehran and at the Natanz pilot fuel \nenrichment plant 150 miles south of the Iranian capital. To the best of \nmy knowledge, Iran has not offered a satisfactory explanation as to the \nIAEA's discovery of this materiel.\n\n  Reports are that Iran has sought magnets for thousands of such gas \ncentrifuges. Also, Iran has not been able to explain experiments with \npolonium-210, a radioactive element primarily useful as a bomb trigger. \nFinally, Iranian government officials have barred access to selected \nsites for a period of time while--as recent satellite imagery shows--\nthey almost certainly sanitized them of incriminating evidence.\n  I believe it urgent for the United States to support regime change in \nIran. Without regime change, Iran will soon constitute the world's \nleading supporter of terrorism armed with nuclear weapons. That would \nbe a great catastrophe for the Middle East, and for the United States \nand our democratic allies everywhere.\n  The bill I have introduced with Senator Cornyn will facilitate this \nchange by reaching out to the people of Iran and supporting what \nPresident Bush and Secretary of State Powell have called the legitimate \ndesire of the Iranian people to be free.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLARD:\n  S. 2682. A bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal \nService located at 222 West 8th Street, Durango, Colorado, as the ``Ben \nNighthorse Campbell Post Office Building''; to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I send to the desk legislation designate \nthe U.S. Post Office located at 222 West 8th Street in Durango, CO, as \nthe Ben Nighthorse Campbell Post Office Building.\n  My dear friend and colleague, Ben Nighthorse Campbell was born in \nAuburn, CA on April 13, 1933. His mother, Mary Vierra, was a Portuguese \nimmigrant, and his father, Albert Campbell, was a Northern Cheyenne \nIndian.\n  At a young age, Ben developed a passion for the then newly budding \nsport\n\n[[Page S8279]]\n\nof judo. Overcoming numerous, seemingly insurmountable obstacles as a \nyoungster, in college he became the youngest person in the United \nStates to hold the fourth degree black belt. He went on to study in \nJapan with the most respected judo masters. Ben was never short on \ndetermination. One student in particular, was a menacing opponent. He \nkept his photo on the wall of his room, and shouted to it often, ``I \nwill beat you!''--and he finally did.\n  Ben was named to the U.S. Olympic Judo team in 1964, but an injury \ncaused him to collapse on the floor during the match, which yielded his \nopponent the bronze medal by default. Ben went on to bring the sport of \njudo into a specialized system for kids, teaching them self discipline, \nself control and self respect, as he established one of the first \nsuccessful clubs for kids.\n  With Campbell's determination and magnanimous spirit, it was only \nnatural that he enter the political arena where his perseverance has in \nfact left its mark on American history. Campbell likes to view himself \nas a person of passion and this passion has rattled more than a few \nformidable foes. As the only American Indian in Congress he found \nhimself, de facto, the representative of all Indians throughout the \nUnited States. In his time on the Indian Affairs Committee, he got more \nlegislation passed for Indians than anyone in the Nation's history.\n  Ben is also a renowned jewelry designer, athlete, former truck \ndriver, and trainer of champion quarter horses. He has been married to \nhis wife, Linda, for more than 35 years. He is the father of two grown \nchildren, Colin Campbell and Shanan Longfellow. He is a proud \ngrandfather to Luke and Saylor Longfellow and Lauren Campbell.\n  Ben has been one of the most fascinating figures on the political \nscene, and will be deeply missed when he retires. I am proud to call \nhim friend. It is only fitting that we can honor his legacy by naming \nthis post office after him.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2682\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. BEN NIGHTHORSE CAMPBELL POST OFFICE BUILDING.\n\n       (a) Designation.--The facility of the United States Postal \n     Service located at 222 West 8th Street, Durango, Colorado, \n     shall be known and designated as the ``Ben Nighthorse \n     Campbell Post Office Building''.\n       (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation, \n     document, paper, or other record of the United States to the \n     facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be \n     a reference to the ``Ben Nighthorse Campbell Post Office \n     Building''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FITZGERALD (for himself and Mr. Akaka):\n  S. 2683. A bill to provide for certain financial reporting \nrequirements to apply to certain small executive branch agencies, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I am joined today by Senator Daniel K. \nAkaka in introducing the Financial Accountability Expansion Act of \n2004, which would ensure the fiscal accountability of Federal entities. \nThis bill would strengthen Federal financial management by subjecting \nall Federal entities in the Executive Branch to the stringent financial \naudit requirements that currently apply to most cabinet level \ndepartments and major agencies.\n  Congressional efforts to improve financial management and to reduce \nthe waste, fraud, and abuse of taxpayer dollars began almost 25 years \nago with the enactment of the Federal Managers Financial Integrity Act \nof 1982, which intended to strengthen internal controls and accounting \nsystems. Another important financial management reform initiative was \nthe Chief Financial Officers Act (CFO) of 1990. Among other things, the \nCFO Act created 24 CFO and deputy CFO positions in cabinet departments \nand major Executive Branch agencies, and required the annual \npreparation and audit of financial statements.\n  I would briefly like to mention that the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, which is now the third largest Federal department, is the \nonly cabinet level department that is not subject to the CFO Act. \nTherefore, on August 1, 2003, Senator Akaka and I introduced S. 1567, \nthe Department of Homeland Security Financial Accountability Act, that \nwould subject the Department to the same financial management practices \ncurrently required of all other major Federal agencies. We are pleased \nthat the Senate passed this bill, as amended, and the House of \nRepresentatives is expected to pass its version of the bill in the near \nfuture.\n  The CFO Act improved the financial management of cabinet departments \nand major Federal agencies; however, it did not address the fiscal \npolicies and practices of the rest of the Executive Branch. Therefore, \nin 2002, I was the Senate sponsor of the Accountability of Tax Dollars \nAct (ATDA). This Act, which became law on November 7, 2002, amended the \nCFO Act to require agencies with budget authority of over $25 million \nto prepare annual financial statements and have them independently \naudited. Due to the enactment of the ATDA, an additional 76 agencies \nare now subject to requirements for annually audited financial \nstatements.\n  The ATDA also provided authority to the Director of the Office of \nManagement and Budget (OMB) to waive or exempt certain agencies from \nthe Act's requirements. The OMB Director may waive these requirements \nduring the first two years of implementation if an agency lacks the \nbudgeted resources or requires additional time to develop financial \nmanagement practices and systems. The OMB Director may exempt agencies \nwith budget authority under $25 million if it is determined that there \nis an absence of risk associated with the agency's operations.\n  To improve upon the legislative changes Congress passed in 2002, the \nFinancial Accountability Expansion Act of 2004 would further expand the \naudit requirements of the CFO Act to every remaining Federal entity in \nthe Executive Branch. Each Executive Branch agency or entity, \nregardless of its size or budget authority, would be subject to the \nfinancial oversight and accountability that annual audits of financial \nstatements provide. In order to assist small agencies that may not have \nadequate financial resources or personnel to comply with these \nrequirements, this bill would authorize the Secretary of the Treasury \nto enter into one or more contracts on behalf of the agency, or \nmultiple agencies through ``bundling,'' for the preparation and \nindependent audit of the financial statement.\n  The bill also would require OMB to conduct a thorough assessment and \nsubmit a report to Congress regarding those Federal entities not \ncurrently required to prepare financial statements and have them \nindependently audited. This study is necessary to ensure that OMB and \nCongress have an accurate and complete picture of the breadth and depth \nof the gaps in the financial accountability of the Executive Branch.\n  Senator Akaka and I have long had an interest in ensuring that the \nFederal Government operates effectively and efficiently, and does not \nwaste taxpayer dollars through poor fiscal management. The independent \naudits of financial statements that this bill would require of the \nentire Executive Branch would strengthen the fiscal accountability of \nthe entire Federal Government and reduce the opportunities for waste, \nfraud, and abuse.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2683\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Financial Accountability \n     Expansion Act of 2004''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Family Smoking \n     Prevention and Tobacco Control Act''.\n\n     SEC. 1102. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The use of tobacco products by the Nation's children is \n     a pediatric disease of considerable proportions that results \n     in new generations of tobacco-dependent children and adults.\n       (2) A consensus exists within the scientific and medical \n     communities that tobacco products are inherently dangerous \n     and cause cancer, heart disease, and other serious adverse \n     health effects.\n       (3) Nicotine is an addictive drug.\n       (4) Virtually all new users of tobacco products are under \n     the minimum legal age to purchase such products.\n       (5) Tobacco advertising and marketing contribute \n     significantly to the use of nicotine-containing tobacco \n     products by adolescents.\n       (6) Because past efforts to restrict advertising and \n     marketing of tobacco products have failed adequately to curb \n     tobacco use by adolescents, comprehensive restrictions on the \n     sale, promotion, and distribution of such products are \n     needed.\n       (7) Federal and State governments have lacked the legal and \n     regulatory authority and resources they need to address \n     comprehensively the public health and societal problems \n     caused by the use of tobacco products.\n       (8) Federal and State public health officials, the public \n     health community, and the public at large recognize that the \n     tobacco industry should be subject to ongoing oversight.\n       (9) Under article I, section 8 of the Constitution, the \n     Congress is vested with the responsibility for regulating \n     interstate commerce and commerce with Indian tribes.\n       (10) The sale, distribution, marketing, advertising, and \n     use of tobacco products are activities in and substantially \n     affecting interstate commerce because they are sold, \n     marketed, advertised, and distributed in interstate commerce \n     on a nationwide basis, and have a substantial effect on the \n     Nation's economy.\n       (11) The sale, distribution, marketing, advertising, and \n     use of such products substantially affect interstate commerce \n     through the health care and other costs attributable to the \n     use of tobacco products.\n       (12) It is in the public interest for Congress to enact \n     legislation that provides the Food and Drug Administration \n     with the authority to regulate tobacco products and the \n     advertising and promotion of such products. The benefits to \n     the American people from enacting such legislation would be \n     significant in human and economic terms.\n       (13) Tobacco use is the foremost preventable cause of \n     premature death in America. It causes over 400,000 deaths in \n     the United States each year and approximately 8,600,000 \n     Americans have chronic illnesses related to smoking.\n       (14) Reducing the use of tobacco by minors by 50 percent \n     would prevent well over 6,500,000 of today's children from \n     becoming regular, daily smokers, saving over 2,000,000 of \n     them from premature death due to tobacco induced disease. \n     Such a reduction in youth smoking would also result in \n     approximately $75,000,000,000 in savings attributable to \n     reduced health care costs.\n       (15) Advertising, marketing, and promotion of tobacco \n     products have been especially directed to attract young \n     persons to use tobacco products and these efforts have \n     resulted in increased use of such products by youth. Past \n     efforts to oversee these activities have not been successful \n     in adequately preventing such increased use.\n       (16) In 2001, the tobacco industry spent more than \n     $11,000,000,000 to attract new users, retain current users, \n     increase current consumption, and generate favorable long-\n     term attitudes toward smoking and tobacco use.\n       (17) Tobacco product advertising often misleadingly \n     portrays the use of tobacco as socially acceptable and \n     healthful to minors.\n       (18) Tobacco product advertising is regularly seen by \n     persons under the age of 18, and persons under the age of 18 \n     are regularly exposed to tobacco product promotional efforts.\n       (19) Through advertisements during and sponsorship of \n     sporting events, tobacco has become strongly associated with \n     sports and has become portrayed as an integral part of sports \n     and the healthy lifestyle associated with rigorous sporting \n     activity.\n       (20) Children are exposed to substantial and unavoidable \n     tobacco advertising that leads to favorable beliefs about \n     tobacco use, plays a role in leading young people to \n     overestimate the prevalence of tobacco use, and increases the \n     number of young people who begin to use tobacco.\n       (21) The use of tobacco products in motion pictures and \n     other mass media glamorizes its use for young people and \n     encourages them to use tobacco products.\n       (22) Tobacco advertising expands the size of the tobacco \n     market by increasing consumption of tobacco products \n     including tobacco use by young people.\n       (23) Children are more influenced by tobacco advertising \n     than adults, they smoke the most advertised brands.\n       (24) Tobacco company documents indicate that young people \n     are an important and often crucial segment of the tobacco \n     market. Children, who tend to be more price-sensitive than \n     adults, are influenced by advertising and promotion practices \n     that result in drastically reduced cigarette prices.\n       (25) Comprehensive advertising restrictions will have a \n     positive effect on the smoking rates of young people.\n       (26) Restrictions on advertising are necessary to prevent \n     unrestricted tobacco advertising from undermining legislation \n     prohibiting access to young people and providing for \n     education about tobacco use.\n       (27) International experience shows that advertising \n     regulations that are stringent and comprehensive have a \n     greater impact on overall tobacco use and young people's use \n     than weaker or less comprehensive ones.\n       (28) Text only requirements, although not as stringent as a \n     ban, will help reduce underage use of tobacco products while \n     preserving the informational function of advertising.\n       (29) It is in the public interest for Congress to adopt \n     legislation to address the public health crisis created by \n     actions of the tobacco industry.\n       (30) The final regulations promulgated by the Secretary of \n     Health and Human Services in the August 28, 1996, issue of \n     the Federal Register (61 Fed. Reg. 44615-44618) for inclusion \n     as part 897 of title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, are \n     consistent with the First Amendment to the United States \n     Constitution and with the standards set forth in the \n     amendments made by this subtitle for the regulation of \n     tobacco products by the Food and Drug Administration and the \n     restriction on the sale and distribution, including access to \n     and the advertising and promotion of, tobacco products \n     contained in such regulations are substantially related to \n     accomplishing the public health goals of this subtitle.\n       (31) The regulations described in paragraph (30) will \n     directly and materially advance the Federal Government's \n     substantial interest in reducing the number of children and \n     adolescents who use cigarettes and smokeless tobacco and in \n     preventing the life-threatening health consequences \n     associated with tobacco use. An overwhelming majority of \n     Americans who use tobacco products begin using such products \n     while they are minors and become addicted to the nicotine in \n     those products before reaching the age of 18. Tobacco \n     advertising and promotion plays a crucial role in the \n     decision of these minors to\n\n[[Page S8379]]\n\n     begin using tobacco products. Less restrictive and less \n     comprehensive approaches have not and will not be effective \n     in reducing the problems addressed by such regulations. The \n     reasonable restrictions on the advertising and promotion of \n     tobacco products contained in such regulations will lead to a \n     significant decrease in the number of minors using and \n     becoming addicted to those products.\n       (32) The regulations described in paragraph (30) impose no \n     more extensive restrictions on communication by tobacco \n     manufacturers and sellers than are necessary to reduce the \n     number of children and adolescents who use cigarettes and \n     smokeless tobacco and to prevent the life-threatening health \n     consequences associated with tobacco use. Such regulations \n     are narrowly tailored to restrict those advertising and \n     promotional practices which are most likely to be seen or \n     heard by youth and most likely to entice them into tobacco \n     use, while affording tobacco manufacturers and sellers ample \n     opportunity to convey information about their products to \n     adult consumers.\n       (33) Tobacco dependence is a chronic disease, one that \n     typically requires repeated interventions to achieve long-\n     term or permanent abstinence.\n       (34) Because the only known safe alternative to smoking is \n     cessation, interventions should target all smokers to help \n     them quit completely.\n       (35) Tobacco products have been used to facilitate and \n     finance criminal activities both domestically and \n     internationally. Illicit trade of tobacco products has been \n     linked to organized crime and terrorist groups.\n       (36) It is essential that the Food and Drug Administration \n     review products sold or distributed for use to reduce risks \n     or exposures associated with tobacco products and that it be \n     empowered to review any advertising and labeling for such \n     products. It is also essential that manufacturers, prior to \n     marketing such products, be required to demonstrate that such \n     products will meet a series of rigorous criteria, and will \n     benefit the health of the population as a whole, taking into \n     account both users of tobacco products and persons who do not \n     currently use tobacco products.\n       (37) Unless tobacco products that purport to reduce the \n     risks to the public of tobacco use actually reduce such \n     risks, those products can cause substantial harm to the \n     public health to the extent that the individuals, who would \n     otherwise not consume tobacco products or would consume such \n     products less, use tobacco products purporting to reduce \n     risk. Those who use products sold or distributed as modified \n     risk products that do not in fact reduce risk, rather than \n     quitting or reducing their use of tobacco products, have a \n     substantially increased likelihood of suffering disability \n     and premature death. The costs to society of the widespread \n     use of products sold or distributed as modified risk products \n     that do not in fact reduce risk or that increase risk include \n     thousands of unnecessary deaths and injuries and huge costs \n     to our health care system.\n       (38) As the National Cancer Institute has found, many \n     smokers mistakenly believe that ``low tar'' and ``light'' \n     cigarettes cause fewer health problems than other cigarettes. \n     As the National Cancer Institute has also found, mistaken \n     beliefs about the health consequences of smoking ``low tar'' \n     and ``light'' cigarettes can reduce the motivation to quit \n     smoking entirely and thereby lead to disease and death.\n       (39) Recent studies have demonstrated that there has been \n     no reduction in risk on a population-wide basis from ``low \n     tar'' and ``light'' cigarettes and such products may actually \n     increase the risk of tobacco use.\n       (40) The dangers of products sold or distributed as \n     modified risk tobacco products that do not in fact reduce \n     risk are so high that there is a compelling governmental \n     interest in insuring that statements about modified risk \n     tobacco products are complete, accurate, and relate to the \n     overall disease risk of the product.\n       (41) As the Federal Trade Commission has found, consumers \n     have misinterpreted advertisements in which one product is \n     claimed to be less harmful than a comparable product, even in \n     the presence of disclosures and advisories intended to \n     provide clarification.\n       (42) Permitting manufacturers to make unsubstantiated \n     statements concerning modified risk tobacco products, whether \n     express or implied, even if accompanied by disclaimers would \n     be detrimental to the public health.\n       (43) The only way to effectively protect the public health \n     from the dangers of unsubstantiated modified risk tobacco \n     products is to empower the Food and Drug Administration to \n     require that products that tobacco manufacturers sold or \n     distributed for risk reduction be approved in advance of \n     marketing, and to require that the evidence relied on to \n     support approval of these products is rigorous.\n\n     SEC. 1103. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purposes of this subtitle are--\n       (1) to provide authority to the Food and Drug \n     Administration to regulate tobacco products under the Federal \n     Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.), by \n     recognizing it as the primary Federal regulatory authority \n     with respect to the manufacture, marketing, and distribution \n     of tobacco products;\n       (2) to ensure that the Food and Drug Administration has the \n     authority to address issues of particular concern to public \n     health officials, especially the use of tobacco by young \n     people and dependence on tobacco;\n       (3) to authorize the Food and Drug Administration to set \n     national standards controlling the manufacture of tobacco \n     products and the identity, public disclosure, and amount of \n     ingredients used in such products;\n       (4) to provide new and flexible enforcement authority to \n     ensure that there is effective oversight of the tobacco \n     industry's efforts to develop, introduce, and promote less \n     harmful tobacco products;\n       (5) to vest the Food and Drug Administration with the \n     authority to regulate the levels of tar, nicotine, and other \n     harmful components of tobacco products;\n       (6) in order to ensure that consumers are better informed, \n     to require tobacco product manufacturers to disclose research \n     which has not previously been made available, as well as \n     research generated in the future, relating to the health and \n     dependency effects or safety of tobacco products;\n       (7) to continue to permit the sale of tobacco products to \n     adults in conjunction with measures to ensure that they are \n     not sold or accessible to underage purchasers;\n       (8) to impose appropriate regulatory controls on the \n     tobacco industry;\n       (9) to promote cessation to reduce disease risk and the \n     social costs associated with tobacco related diseases; and\n       (10) to strengthen legislation against illicit trade in \n     tobacco products.\n\n     SEC. 1104.

Also transmitted for the information of the \nSenate is the report of the Department of State with respect to the \nProtocol.\n  The Protocol would bring the existing Convention into closer \nconformity with current U.S. tax treaty policy. As modified by the \nProtocol, the Convention would be similar to tax treaties between the \nUnited States and other developed nations. The Protocol was concluded \nin recognition of the importance of the United States' economic \nrelations with the Netherlands.\n  The Protocol would modify the treatment of certain cross-border \ndividend payments and would modernize the Convention's anti-treaty-\nshopping provisions. The Protocol also would liberalize provisions in \nthe existing Convention regarding the mutual recognition of each \ncountry's pension plans. Other provisions in the Protocol update the \nConvention to take account of changes in law in the two countries over \nthe last 10 years. The exchange of notes with an attached Understanding \nprovides guidance to taxpayers and each government regarding the \nintended interpretation of certain provisions of the existing \nConvention, as amended.\n  I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to \nthis Protocol, and that the Senate give its advice and consent to \nratification.\nGeorge W.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Finance \nCommittee be discharged from further consideration of S. 2261 and that \nthe Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2261) to expand certain preferential trade \n     treatment for Haiti.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I am very pleased we are moving forward \ntoday with passage of the Haiti Economic Recovery Opportunity Act. \nCongressman Clay Shaw in the House and I have been working on Haiti \ntrade legislation for some time. I thank Congressman Shaw for his \nsupport. I also want to give my sincere thanks to Senators Lindsey \nGraham and Ernest Hollings. Without their help and support we would not \nhave been successful in our efforts today. Let me take a moment to \nmention all of our cosponsors as well: Senators Biden, Breaux, Chafee, \nColeman, Daschle, Dodd, Durbin, Bob Graham, Hagel, Jeffords, \nLautenberg, Lieberman, Lugar, Bill Nelson, Gordon Smith, Sununu, and \nVoinovich. I thank them for their support and their efforts in getting \nthis bill passed.\n  This bill can really change things for Haiti. Once it is signed into \nlaw, it will make a very real, very lasting difference in a country \nthat is the poorest in our hemisphere--and one that has an 80-plus \npercent unemployment rate and a less than $400 per capita income for \nindividuals.\n  This bill is going to use trade incentives to encourage the post-\nAristide government to make much needed reforms, while encouraging \nforeign direct investment--the most powerful, and yet underutilized, \ntool of development. This bill, quite simply, will create thousands of \njobs--one of the most important things for the Haitian people right \nnow.\n  The people of Haiti want to work. They are good workers--they are \nhard workers. They are industrious. This bill is going to give them the \nchance to have jobs. It is going to give them a chance at economic \nrecovery through economic opportunity. In the last decade, Haiti has \ngone from over 100,000 assembly jobs to less than 30,000 today. Our \nbill helps create jobs by providing duty-free entry to apparel articles \nassembled in Haiti contingent upon Presidential certification that the \nnew government is making significant political, economic, and social \nreforms.\n  The bill also caps the amount of duty-free articles at 1.5 percent of \nthe total amount of U.S. apparel imports, growing to 3.5 percent over 7 \nyears. Currently, Haiti accounts for less than .5 percent of all U.S. \napparel imports, and although these provisions seem modest by U.S. \nstandards, in Haiti they are substantial.\n  This bill is not the ``silver bullet'' for Haiti, because there is no \nsilver bullet for Haiti. Rebuilding Haiti is going to require time, \nattention, and determination on the part of the people of Haiti, the \ncountries in the region, and ultimately the entire international \ncommunity. But, passage of the Haiti Economic Recovery Opportunity Act \nis a powerful indicator that Haiti has the support necessary to move \nforward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about an initiative \nthat is long overdue. Thanks to the efforts of Senator DeWine, Senator \nBob Graham, and to the other cosponsors of the pending measure, the \nHaiti Economic Recovery Opportunity, or HERO Act, of 2004 is finally \ngetting the attention it deserves.\n  Haiti has endured intense strife over the course of the last 3 years. \nMost recently, floods have devastated much of the country, and armed \ngangs have destabilized cities and terrorized rural areas, ultimately \nforcing the elected president from office.\n  Although much more support will be necessary in the near future, the \nHERO Act is an excellent first step in the process of establishing \nstability and security in Haiti.\n  Unemployment is a major factor in the instability of the country. \nMore than two-thirds of eligible workers cannot find jobs in the formal \neconomy. The HERO Act begins to address that need by providing living-\nwage jobs in the apparel industry for thousands of Haitians.\n  Again, I want to stress how important it is to view this as only the \nfirst part of a large program to address the abject poverty and \npolitical chaos that has beleaguered Haiti. With this kind of forward-\nlooking initiative, we can help our neighbors to overcome these \ndifficult times. Only through concrete and meaningful U.S. assistance \non a scale commensurate with Haiti's needs can be ever hope to reverse \nthe misery, suffering, and hopelessness that have become commonplace in \nthe lives of close neighbors--8 million of them.\n  I strongly support this legislation and was pleased to be a \ncosponsor. The people of Haiti have waited too long for the HERO Act to \nbecome law. It is time for the United States to demonstrate its concern \nfor its suffering Haitian neighbors. Now that the Senate has acted, I \nhope that the Bush administration will finally make this a priority and \nurge the House leadership to act on this measure before the August \nrecess.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the DeWine \nsubstitute amendment be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be read a \nthird time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, \nen bloc, and that any statements relating to the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3565) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To provide a substitute amendment to ensure violations of \n              laws relating to circumvention are enforced)\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, this week we began with the consideration \nof a constitutional amendment on the institution of marriage, an \nimportant dialog, I felt, for this body. We had a good debate on both \nsides of the aisle on the definition of marriage. I thank my colleagues \nfor keeping the debate on the subject, very civil, and handled in a \nvery respectable way.\n  I personally was disappointed we did not succeed in getting to the \nconsideration of the text of the amendment. As to the timing of the \namendment, people kept questioning again and again, Why did you bring \nit up now? It was clearly determined by the fact that we had activist \njudges, beginning in the middle of May, in Massachusetts who radically \nredefined what marriage over the thousands of years has been \ninterpreted to be.\n  Right now there are lawsuits pending in 11 other States, and it is \njust a matter of time before the definition of marriage between a man \nand a woman will be destroyed in all 50 States. Amending the \nConstitution to protect marriage is the only viable option left to \nCongress. It is a debate we did not seek, but it was one that was \nbrought to us by another branch of Government by activist judges who \ndetermined what that definition is.\n  It is important for the legislative branch, directly elected by the \nAmerican people, to express itself on this issue. We simply are not \ngoing to shirk from our responsibility to protect marriage, and we \ndeserve to have a say in the matter. Although we were blocked from \nbringing it to the floor, I can assure everyone it will be back. The \nissue is not simply going away.\n  In addition, we completed last night the Australia free-trade bill, a \nvery important bill managed by Chairman Grassley. The outcome of the \nvote was 80 to 16 last night on final passage.\n  The significance of this bill was stated on the floor last night and \nit centers on the fact that two-way trade between the United States and \nAustralia is at a level of about $28 billion each year. We have a \nlittle over $89 billion surplus with Australia, which is the greatest \nwith any nation. More than 99 percent of our exports from Australia \nwill enter duty-free once this agreement goes into effect.\n  The agreement we approved yesterday in this body is expected to \nproduce an increase of about $2 billion annually in trade for both \nnations. That means the bill we passed last night will result\n\n[[Page S8403]]\n\nin the creation of about 40,000 new jobs in my own State of Tennessee.\n  Australia is a very important market. Tennesseans exported more to \nAustralia than to France last year. Tennessean companies exported $225 \nmillion to Australia, which is approximately a 10-percent increase from \n1999.\n  The bill itself is even more than increasing business opportunities. \nAustralia indeed is one of our most steadfast allies and a key partner \nin the war on terror. I had the opportunity to talk to the Prime \nMinister of Australia last night after completion of the bill and \nthanked him for that support of the broad coalition that has been \nassembled across the world to fight this war on terror.\n  Australians have fought beside Americans in every major conflict in \nthe last 100 years, and this agreement strengthens that already close \nbond forged between two old friends.\n  Thirdly, this week the Senate took an important step with respect to \nthe FSC/ETI, the JOBS bill, by sending it to conference. The Senate had \npassed a bill. The House had passed a bill. There had been obstruction \nto going to conference, but we came to an agreement yesterday and the \nbill has been sent to conference. It is timely legislation. Every month \nwe do not pass the legislation there is a 1-percent Euro tax or a \ntariff increase each and every month. It is now at 9 percent. That is \nunfair. It is unfair to consumers and it is unfair to manufacturers.\n  Once we work this bill through conference and the President signs it \nand it becomes law, it will create jobs. So there has been real \nprogress in that regard.\n  Fourthly, this week we passed H.R. 4363, the Helping Hands for \nHomeownership Act. This bill came out of the Banking Committee, which \nis chaired by Senator Shelby, and it will go to the President's desk.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/16/senate-section/article/S8403-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8403]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. FRIST. As we look ahead to Monday, we will consider the \nnomination of William Myers to be a U.S. circuit judge for the Ninth \nCircuit. A few moments ago, I filed a cloture petition on the judicial \nnomination because of the objection to a time agreement that was \nexpressed from the other side of the aisle. That vote will occur at \n2:15 on Tuesday. Therefore, there will be no rollcall votes on Monday. \nSenators should come to the floor during Monday's session to debate \nthis nomination.\n  As we all know, next week will be the final week prior to the recess. \nIt will be a very busy week. It should be a very productive week. I ask \nin advance for everyone's patience and cooperation as we wrap up our \nwork for this legislative period.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/16/senate-section/article/S8403-2", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8403]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 1 P.M.
